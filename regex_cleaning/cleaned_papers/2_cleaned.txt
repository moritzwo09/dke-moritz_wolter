There are significant challenges in
predicting multiphase chemical kinetics due to
the complex coupling of reaction and mass
transport across a phase boundary (i.e.
interface). Here we describe a framework for
predicting multiphase kinetics that embeds the
elementary kinetic steps of reaction, solvation
and diffusion into a coarse grain spatial
description of two phases.

The model is

constructed to bridge the short-timescale
interfacial dynamics observed in molecular
simulations with the longer timescales observed in kinetic experiments. A simple set of governing
differential equations is presented, which when solved numerically or analytically, yield accurate
predictions of multiphase kinetics in microdroplets. Although the equations are formulated for gasliquid reactions, the underlying conceptual framework is general and can be applied to
transformations in other two-phase systems (solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, etc.).
I. Introduction
Chemistry invariably invokes images of beakers and flasks filled with liquids, with the
chemist mixing, stirring, and heating reactants in various proportions. Wet chemistry of this type,
involving a chemical reaction in a single phase, is vanishingly rare in natural systems—from the
environment that surrounds us to the mechanics of our own biology. On a global scale, multiphase
processes on the Earth’s surface and in its atmosphere span an incredibly broad range, from
familiar phenomena like the hydrologic cycle and weather patterns to more subtle effects like the
influence of ground emissions on cloud formation and the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere.1,
2 Multiphase processes are central for biology, as virtually all organisms rely on gas-liquid or solid-

liquid exchange with the environment to maintain homeostasis. The boundary of the cell wall
permits the electrochemical gradient necessary for cellular function and recent work has
highlighted an emerging understanding of liquid-liquid phase separation within the cell.3-5
Furthermore, solute transport across polymer membranes to achieve selective separations is of
immense technological importance for future clean energy applications.6 In all of these systems
understanding how multiphase transformations emerge from the complex coupling of chemical
reactions with mass transport across phase boundaries remains a substantial challenge.
Here we present a general approach for quantifying and predicting multiphase kinetics
using a discretized or “compartmentalized” representation of chemistry spanning two phases.
These methods grew out of explicit kinetic simulations of multiphase chemistry in aerosols,
emulsions7 and droplets8-12 implemented in a stochastic reaction diffusion simulator,
Kinetiscope©.13 This work builds upon our previous efforts11, 12 to develop a simple, physically
realistic framework for predicting multiphase aerosol chemistry. Here we expand upon this
framework to include more sophisticated descriptions of gas and liquid phase diffusion. The result
is a “compartmentalized” description of kinetics expressed as a simple set of coupled differential
equations, which when solved numerically (or using approximate closed form solutions)
accurately predict surface and bulk uptake coefficients as well as multiphase reaction kinetics in
aerosols and droplets. Although the current work is formulated for gas-liquid reactive uptake, the
conceptual features of the framework can be readily adapted to kinetics in liquid-liquid, liquidsolid, or gas-solid systems.
II. A Compartmentalized Description of Multiphase Chemical Kinetics
As illustrated in Fig. 1A, any multiphase kinetic model starts with the same basic
framework. At equilibrium and in the absence of a reaction, X (in this case a gas phase molecule)
is partitioned between the gas (g) and liquid (bulk) phases. The concentrations of X in the gas
([X(g,∞)]) and liquid ([X(blk)]) are governed by differences in solvation free energies and described
𝑔𝑏

by a Henry’s Law constant, (𝐻𝑐𝑐 = [X(blk)]/ [X(g,∞)]) where cc denotes the dimensionless form. Prior
to the widespread use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the concentration of X at the

Figure 1: Concentration profiles of gas phase solute X and liquid phase solute Y in a two-phase system.
(A) For the case where there is no reaction the equilibrium concentrations of X in phase 1 (black), phase
2 (green) and at the biphasic interface (red) are governed by Henry’s law constants (H cc). (B) Steady
state concentration profiles and gradients in X that form in the gas (blue) and liquid phases (purple) due
to its reaction with Y. Also shown are compartments of length (L), which are distinguished by changes
or gradients in X.
droplet interface (i.e., X(ads)) was assumed to be that of either the gas or liquid phase. However,
simulations show that this is often not the case, with trace gases exhibiting negative surface
solvation free energies relative to the gas and liquid phases and thus, as illustrated in Fig. 1A,
𝑔𝑠

increased density the interface (i.e., 𝐻𝑐𝑐 = [X(ads)]/[X(g,∞)] > 1). At equilibrium a two-phase system,
consisting of a single mutually soluble species X, can be envisioned as three distinct spatial regions
or compartments each with a characteristic [X] (i.e., [X(g,∞)], [X(ads)] and [X(blk)]).
In the presence of a liquid solute Y that reacts with X, the equilibrium concentration of X
during the reaction is perturbed as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Depending upon the surface activity of Y
and the overall reaction rate relative to the mass transport timescales, concentration gradients of X
(and potentially Y) can form at the gas and liquid sides of the interface. This means that
concentrations of X in the gas and liquid phase are no longer uniform as depicted in Fig. 1 A and
additional compartments or regions are needed to represent these gradients. For example, fast
surface reactions readily deplete the local gas phase concentration above the interface such that
[X(g,∞)] > [X(gs)]. Similarly, reactions that substantially attenuate the flux of X entering the liquid,
produce gradients in X such that [X(rd)] > [X(core)].
Rather than dividing the two phase system up into a large number of small regions or layers,
our approach is to coarse grain the system into a few key, kinetically relevant regions or
compartments.12 Unlike kinetic multilayer models,14-19 we consider only the average
concentrations of X and Y within each region, rather than attempting to capture the explicit
functional form of the concentration gradients. These “kinetically relevant” regions represent
places where the concentrations of X or Y are distinct or where there is the potential for gradients
in X and Y to form due to the strong coupling of reaction and diffusion. These compartments (Fig.
1B), each with a characteristic spatial dimension, correspond to the gas phase, gas-surface region,
the interface, the reacto-diffusive volume below the interface and the inner core of the droplet.
The interface length or thickness (δ) is assumed to be ~ 1 nm, which approximates the
width of the density profile in MD simulations of the air-water interface.20-22 The length of the
reacto-diffusive compartment (Lrd) depends upon the X + Y reaction rate,

, and [Y(blk)] are the liquid phase diffusion constant of X, the rate coefficient for the X

+ Y reaction and the bulk concentration of solute Y, respectively. The length of the core region for
a spherical aerosol with radius, r, is Lcore = r – δ – Lrd. Both Lrd and Lcore are dynamic quantities
that evolve during a reaction as Y is consumed. For reactions that are slow relative to diffusion,
Lrd ~ r and hence the length of the core tends to zero as Lrd → r. To account for this limit a
“transition function” (𝐿′𝑟𝑑 ) is needed,

Eq. (2)

which closely approximates the reaction-diffusion length when 𝐿𝑟𝑑 < 𝑟 and asymptotes to 𝑟 when
𝐿𝑟𝑑 > 𝑟, as shown in Fig. S1.
The model described consists of three compartments: the surface (srf), reacto-diffusive (rd)
and inner core (core) volumes, with respective subscript denotations indicated in parentheses. As
noted above, a near-surface compartment can also be implemented if the gas dynamics near the
surface are of interest. For simplicity we neglect this region and assume gas-phase diffusion occurs
directly to and from the droplet interface as explored in depth in Sect. V.A, with further details
included in Appendix A. These sections illustrate how the gas-phase itself is defined directly as
acting upon the surface compartment, such that no explicit “gas” compartment is necessary to
execute the model.
As shown in Fig. 2, our model of multiphase chemistry is formulated as a sequence of
elementary kinetic steps embedded in three compartments. These steps describe the uptake of X
and its reaction with Y. In addition to these chemical equilibria and reaction steps, diffusion
pathways are included that describe the transfer of X and Y between compartments. This
description aims to connect continuum descriptions of diffusive transport23, 24 with the molecularity
of individual kinetic steps25-28 that govern trace gas uptake and reaction.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, trace gas uptake and reaction occurs when a gas phase molecule
X(g,∞) diffuses to the near surface region (indicated with subscript gs) of the droplet or interface
𝑔𝑎𝑠

with a rate constant of 𝑘𝑋𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 , producing the species labeled X(gs). This step is modeled directly in
the surface compartment since, as noted above, we assume that diffusion between the interface and
the near surface is instantaneous. The backward rate constant for gas phase diffusion away from
𝑔𝑎𝑠

the near surface (i.e., X(gs) → X(g,∞)) is also 𝑘𝑋𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 . Once near the surface, X(gs) can adsorb to the

Figure 2: Conceptual diagram of the coarse grain kinetic framework. On the left, the multiphase system
is divided up into kinetically relevant regions: gas (g), surface (s), reacto-diffusive (rd) volume and core
(core). Embedded within these compartments are elementary kinetic steps that describe X adsorption
(ads), desorption (des), solvation (solv) and desolvation (desolv). In addition, there are steps that
𝑔𝑎𝑠

describe gas phase diffusion of X (𝑘𝑥𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 ) and liquid phase diffusion of X and Y (e.g., 𝑘𝑥𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 ). Hcc are

interface (X(gs)→ X(ads), kads) becoming thermally accommodated (i.e., X(ads)). There is some
probability that X(ads) can then desorb from the interface (X(ads) → X(gs), kdes) back into the gas
phase. This pair of adsorption/desorption steps comprise the gas-surface equilibrium constant,
𝑔𝑠

𝐻𝑐𝑐 , formulated as a Henry’s law coefficient specifically connecting the gas to the surface. Instead
of desorption, X(ads) can instead undergo solvation (X(ads) → X(sb), kXsolv). Once solvated, X(sb) may
desolvate back to form X(ads) (X(sb) → X(ads), kXdesolv), defining a pair of reversible steps with
corresponding rate coefficients kXsolv and kXdesolv. These coefficients make up a second Henry’s law
𝑠𝑏
equilibrium constant (i.e., 𝐻𝑐𝑐
), connecting surface and bulk concentrations of X. Rather than

undergo desolvation, X(sb) can diffuse into the subsurface reacto-diffusive volume (X(rd)) at a rate
𝑟𝑑
proportional to a diffusional rate constant, 𝑘𝑋𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓
. Similarly, X(rd) can diffuse out of the reacto-

diffusive volume back to the surface, or into the inner core of the aerosol becoming X(core). As will
be shown below, partitioning of X between the gas, interface and bulk liquid is described using the
Langmuir equation and the Henry’s law constants illustrated in Fig. 2.
For a non-volatile solute (Y) the reaction with X occurs at the interface, via a Langmuir
Hinshelwood mechanism (X(ads) + Y(ads)), in the reacto-diffusive volume (X(rd) + Y(rd)), and in the
core of the droplet (X(core)+ Y(core)). As discussed in Sect. V.E, the rate constant for the interfacial
𝑠𝑟𝑓
𝑏𝑙𝑘 ) occurring in the reactoreaction (𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛
) need not be the same as that for a bulk reaction (𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛

diffusive and core regions of the droplet. Partitioning of Y between the bulk (Y(rd)) and interface
(Y(ads)) is treated identically to that of X and is described by the kinetic steps of
solvation/desolvation in the Langmuir equation (see Sect. V.C). Here we assume diffusion of Y in
the solvent is rapid and remains uniformly distributed throughout the bulk regions (rd and core) of
the droplet; [Y(rd)] = [Y(core)] = [Y(blk)]. This is assumption is generally valid for reactions with
“trace gases” where [Y] >> [X]. A similar model framework can be used to treat simultaneous
diffusion and reaction of both X and Y, as will be explored in future work.
In summary, in addition to the reaction (X+Y) and reversible diffusion steps there is an
𝑔𝑠

equilibrium governing the partitioning of X between the gas and interface (𝐻𝑐𝑐 ) and two additional
𝑠𝑏
𝑌
equilibria that govern the partitioning X (𝐻𝑐𝑐
) and Y (𝐾𝑒𝑞
) between the bulk and interface (Fig.

2). These equilibria are coupled and respond dynamically to the presence of the X+Y reaction in
each compartment. These steps and the associated differential equations embedded in the
compartmentalized representation of the two-phase system are the basis for the kinetic model
described below.
III. Governing Equations
In most aerosol and droplet experiments, multiphase kinetics are quantified by either the
loss of gas phase X or condensed phase Y. The majority of experiments don’t distinguish between
surface and bulk concentrations, but rather only measure total concentrations of X and/or Y
([X(total)] and [Y(total)]) versus time, which can be expressed as a bimolecular rate law,

Eq. (3)

For a gas-liquid reaction, the rate law in Eq. (3) is proportional to the total uptake coefficient (γtotal),
the gas phase collision frequency computed for a droplet with radius (r), and the mean speed (𝑐̅)
of X in the gas phase. The total rate law and uptake coefficient in Eq. (3) can be expressed as a
sum of the contributions from the three spatial regions (srf, rd, and core) described above, each of
which contributes [Y(total)]t and γtotal,

compartment (i.e., [X(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ], [Y(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ], [X(𝑟𝑑) ], [X(𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒) ], [Y(𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙) ]). As shown previously,12 the product
of the concentration and volume terms in Eqs. (4)-(9) is used to compute the fractional contribution
of each compartment to the [Y(total)]t and γtotal. For a sphere these volumes are,

𝛿
Langmuir adsorption sites at the interface, where
Γ∞(𝑋)

is proportional to the surface area of X (cm2

molec.-1) and δ is interface thickness (1 nm). A full discussion of how the Langmuir framework is
used to describe the surface partitioning of X and Y is provided in Sects. V.B and V.C,
respectively. Lastly, a stoichiometric factor (S) is included in Eq. (20) to provide a simple way to
approximate the role of secondary chemistry when the loss of Y relative to X differs from 1:1. In
Sect. VI, we numerically solve Eqs. (15)-(20) and validate the model results against prior
experimental measurements of multiphase ozone reactions with a variety of aqueous solutes in
microdroplets.
IV. Analytical Solutions
Approximate closed form solutions for both the uptake coefficients and reaction kinetics
of [Y] can be obtained by applying steady-state approximations12 to Eqs. (15)-(19). These
derivations are shown in Sect. SI-2 of the Supplementary Information. The final closed form
kinetic equations, shown below, are obtained using Lambert W functions29 as previously
reported.12 Lambert W functions can be computed in Mathematica (Productlog Function),
MATLAB (W function) and Python (lambertw function) using built in algorithms. Although we
refer to our expressions as “closed-form” or “analytical,” there appears to be no consensus as to
whether Lambert W functions are strictly included in the general definition of closed-form
solutions. Nevertheless, we adopt this convention in light of previous terminology.30
As shown previously,12 deriving the time-dependent expressions for [Y(total)]t relies on
computing “steady-state” expressions for the trace gas X within each compartment. The general
method can be summarized by first applying the steady-state approximation to Eqs. (15)-(19), to
yield an expression for the concentration of X in each region [X(region)] as a function of [Y(total)].
These steady-state expressions [X(region)] are then substituted into Eq. (20), which can then be
integrated by separation of variables and solved for [Y(total)]t as function of time t, radius r, gas
concentration [X(gas,∞)], and the rate coefficients outlined in Sect. II and detailed in Sect. VI. Only
the final equations are shown below with a full derivation provided in Sect. SI-2 of the
Supplementary Information.

occurs within the rd region. Reaction in the core accounts for up to ~10% of the total reactions for
the special case where the 𝐿𝑟𝑑 ≈ 𝐿𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 .

Eq. (27)
[𝑌(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ] in Eq. (24) is computed using the Langmuir equation as described in Sect. V.C. Although
lengthy, these expressions are general and account for cases where trace gas uptake is limited by
either gas or liquid phase diffusion, or when there is strong coupling between surface and bulk
reactions. Importantly, these expressions link the macroscopic quantity of an uptake coefficient
(i.e., the fraction of collisions that yield a reaction) with the microscopic elementary steps of gas
accommodation, reaction and diffusion. We note that Eq. (26) expressing uptake due to reaction in
the inner droplet core assumes that the interfacial X species denoted by (ads) and (sb) are
𝑔𝑏

equilibrated with the gas phase and equal to 𝐻𝑐𝑐 [X𝑔,∞ ]. This assumption is especially valid for the
core uptake since for this reactivity to have much significance, the reacto-diffusive length must be
on the order of the droplet radius, in which case the droplet interface is virtually in equilibrium
with the gas phase. As we have shown previously,10, 12, 20 these uptake expressions become much
simpler for limiting cases often encountered in the laboratory. In Sect. VI we validate these closed
form expressions against the numerical solutions to Eqs. (15)-(20) as well as prior experimental
data on multiphase ozone kinetics in microdroplets.
V. Determination of Rate Coefficients
Here we summarize how to derive, compute or obtain each rate coefficient used in Eqs.
(15)-(20) and the closed form expressions, Eqs. (21)-(27).

A. Gas Phase Diffusion of X: (𝒌𝒅𝒊𝒇𝒇 )

𝐽𝑐 (

𝑋
) = 4 𝜋 ⋅ 𝐷𝑔𝑎𝑠
𝑟 ⋅ [X(𝑔,∞) ],

Eq. (28)

𝑋
where 𝐷𝑔𝑎𝑠
is the gas phase diffusion constant of X. Here, 𝐽𝑐 is the molecular flow in the

“continuum” regime. We implement diffusion in the model as two reversible steps described by a
rate coefficient,

where 𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 is obtained by analyzing the origin of transport equation Eq. (28) and normalizing Jc
by a relevant volumetric term and the gas concentration [X(g,∞)].
Jc is derived using the expression for diffusion of species X through a spherical wall with
outer boundary b and inner boundary a as provided by Crank:32

𝑏−𝑎
Eq. (29)


where the inner boundary a = r and the concentrations are chosen to be [𝑋𝑏 ] = [X𝑔,∞ ] and [𝑋𝑎 ] =
0. Setting [𝑋𝑎 ] = 0 in this way provides the upper bound for the rate of diffusive transport where
the surface concentration at r is completely depleted. For the outer boundary b, we consider the
limit b → ∞ to identify a limiting value for Jc where the flow of X to the spherical interface
approaches a minimum. In the limit b → ∞, Eq. (29) becomes,
𝐽𝑐 (

𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐

) = 4 𝜋 ⋅ 𝐷𝑔𝑎𝑠
𝑟 ⋅ [X(𝑔,∞) ],

Eq. (30)

which is equivalent to Eq. (28). This expression is divided by the spherical shell volume of the

𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐

Eq. (32)

where the gas-diffusion rate coefficient is,
𝑔𝑎𝑠

𝑋
𝐷𝑔𝑎𝑠

𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 = 𝑟 𝛿 .

Eq. (33)

This rate coefficient controls both the diffusion rate of X into the surface compartment generating
[X (𝑔𝑠) ], but also the rate at which [X (𝑔𝑠) ] diffuses away from the surface, re-generating [X(𝑔,∞) ], as
illustrated in Fig. 2. This rate of diffusion is inherently coupled to the rate at which X may adsorb
to the interface. An understanding of this phenomenon and a comparison of the current treatment
with previous derivations by Fuchs and Sutugin33 is provided in Appendix A.
B. Trace Gas X Adsorption, Desorption, Solvation and Desolvation: (kads, kdes, kXsolv , kXdesolv)
Describing multiphase chemical kinetics requires accounting for both diffusion that
governs larger-scale transport between two phases, and the adsorption/desorption terms in Fig. 2
that govern molecular-scale transport at an interface. First, we consider how the adsorption rate
coefficient is related to the collision frequency of a gas X on the droplet interface. Appendix A
unites this gas kinetic framework with a diffusional picture and ties this relationship back to
macroscopic gas-transport descriptions.
Once reactant X has diffused to the liquid surface, adsorption (i.e., thermal
accommodation) to the surface is described by a Langmuir model,34 where adsorption occurs at
specific sites (sitex),

, which

is on the order of ~10-100 ps for many low-molecular weight gases on water surfaces under
ambient atmospheric conditions. These lifetimes can be obtained through a variety of theoretical
and experimental techniques.35 The elementary steps that describe solvation/desolvation of X into

the concentration of a X at the interface may be significantly different than both the gaseous and
liquid-phase concentrations at equilibrium as illustrated in Fig. 1. Furthermore, they provide
through Eqs. (36)-(39) an expression that links the forward and backward rate coefficients for

We note that while adsorption of Y is described in step (R4) by the near-interfacial species Y(sb),
in the current model this is equivalent to the adsorption of Y(total) since we have assumed
instantaneous mixing of species Y throughout the droplet and hence, not formally distinguished

species Y(sb),Y(rd), and Y(core). The Langmuir equilibrium constant (𝐾𝑒𝑞

and theoretical methods. Static and dynamic surface tension measurements are used to obtain
𝑌
values of 𝐾𝑒𝑞
, Γ∞(𝑌) , 𝑘𝑌𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 and 𝑘𝑌𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 . For example, Bleys and Joos39 found that for small

acids and alcohols values of 𝑘𝑌𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 were all around ~ 100 s-1, whereas values of 𝑘𝑌𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 varied by
orders of magnitude and depend upon molecular structure. Nonlinear optical studies of air-water
𝑌
interfaces40 can also constrain values of 𝐾𝑒𝑞
through determinations of the Gibbs Adsorption free

energy. Furthermore, MD simulations provide density profiles of solutes at the air-water interface

that can constrain 𝐾𝑒𝑞

within a Langmuir framework, the consequences of which have been discussed elsewhere.40-42

D. Liquid Phase Diffusion of X: (𝒌𝒔𝒃
𝑿𝒅𝒊𝒇𝒇 , 𝒌𝑿𝒅𝒊𝒇𝒇 , 𝒌𝑿𝒅𝒊𝒇𝒇 )
In addition to the microscopic kinetic steps that describe solvation and desolvation
described above, a diffusional description is used to describe the larger-scale transport of X and Y
in the liquid phase. As shown below for the species X, we formulate liquid phase diffusion in a
way that is analogous to a kinetic rate law. This description follows the same method used in
Kinetiscope©13 to calculate diffusion between two adjacent compartments.
The diffusive flux between two compartments from Fick’s First Law is,

case is not explicitly considered in the derivations shown above since we have broadly assumed
the mixing time for species Y to be much faster than the reaction. However, for cases where
depletion of Y near the interface is possible, an additional set of rates equations can be used, as we

E. Surface and Bulk Reaction Rate Coefficients: (𝒌𝒔𝒓𝒇
𝒓𝒙𝒏 , 𝒌𝒓𝒙𝒏 )

The surface and bulk rate coefficients for the X + Y reaction are key quantities for
predicting multiphase reaction kinetics. Bulk rate coefficients used in this multiphase model are
usually obtained from beaker-scale experiments or theoretical calculations usually under dilute
conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 2, linking reactivity in beaker scale solutions of X and Y with the
analogous multiphase reaction requires understanding all of the non-reactive steps that govern the
partitioning of X and Y between various phases (i.e., gas, interface, and bulk). In previous models12
using a similar framework, we generally assume (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) that
𝑠𝑟𝑓

𝑏𝑙𝑘
the surface reaction rate coefficient is equivalent to the bulk (i.e., 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛 = 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛
). However, there are

good reasons to expect that this might not always be the case since the partial solvation at an
interface can lower reaction barriers or induce more favorable molecular orientations for a reaction
to occur. For example, recent work suggests that rate coefficients for condensation reactions are
100-10000 times faster at air-water and oil-water interfaces than in bulk solutions.43-46
Furthermore, as demonstrated recently by comparing model predictions and experiments, surface
rate coefficients can be estimated for those cases where the partitioning of X and Y between phases
can be adequately constrained.8, 10, 44
VI. Model Validation with Experimental Measurements

Eqs. (15)-(20) are numerically solved and compared to previously published experimental

scenarios. These reactants span a large range of reactivities with ozone, with aqueous rate
coefficients (see Table S1) ranging from k = 1.7 × 103 M-1 s-1 for MA to k =3.4 × 105 M-1 s-1 for
NO2- and k = 1.2 × 109 M-1 s-1 for I-. For each reaction, numerical solutions to the Eqs. (15)-(20)
are obtained using the ND solve algorithm in Mathematica,49 with the output compared to
experimental results shown in Fig. 4. Table S1 in the Supplementary Information provides the
relevant experimental conditions and coefficients used for each reaction. References for and a
discussion of the values in Table S1 can be found in Sec. SI-3.
To highlight the relative roles of the surface and bulk reaction for each case shown in Fig.
3, the full set of Eqs. (15)-(20) is evaluated and labeled “total” in Fig. 4. Total includes surface
and bulk (rd and core) reactions In each case, the numerical predictions replicate the observed
decay kinetics for maleic acid, nitrite and iodide. To ascertain the surface and bulk contributions
to the total observed kinetics, a modified set of predictions are shown in Fig. 4, where only surface
reactions (labeled “surface”) and only the bulk reactions (labeled “bulk”) are computed. The
𝑏𝑙𝑘
“surface” set is computed by removing all terms with 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛
from Eq. (15)-(20) and the “bulk” is
𝑠𝑟𝑓

computed by removing terms with 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛 . This comparison demonstrates that the maleic acid
reaction is predicted to have only a minor surface contribution, whereas the nitrite and iodide
reactions display comparable reactive contributions from both the surface and the bulk. Due to the
differences in the nitrite and iodide reactivities and surface propensities, however, the bulk reaction
is slightly more favored in the case of NO2- whereas the surface is for I-. We note that in previous
studies, which did not include an explicit rd compartment, we underestimated the contribution of
the bulk reaction to the multiphase kinetics of nitrite.11, 12
The right column in Fig. 4 shows the time-evolution of O3 within the droplet. This
concentration is a weighted sum of the O3 concentration within the reactive-diffusion region and
the core region, providing an average concentration throughout the entire droplet. For each system,

O3 is significantly depleted relative to its Henry’s law value (𝐻𝑐𝑐 = [X(g,∞)]), unlike “phase-mixed”
kinetics which dominate for much slower reactions.27 For the MA reaction, [O3] recovers to its
Henry’s law value during the reaction. For the faster rates of nitrite and iodide, ozone remains
depleted throughout the entire reaction, with a moderate recovery observed in the NO2- reaction
and virtually no recovery for the I- case. Intuitively, the degree of O3 depletion scales with the
reaction-diffusion length of ozone at a given time, with severe depletion occurring for scenarios
where the reaction-diffusion length is significantly smaller than the droplet radius throughout the
reaction.
B. Evaluation of the Closed Form Expressions
The closed form expression in Eq. (23) is used to calculate the time-dependence of iodide
loss from the example discussed above. Predictions of Eq. (23) are compared in Fig. 5 with the
exact numerical solutions and the experimental iodide data shown in Fig. 4. We also include

Figure 5: Closed form time-dependent expressions for [I-]t calculated using Eq. (23) (total)
and Eq. (21) (bulk reaction only). Analytical expressions are compared to the numerical
evaluations described above and shown in Fig. 4. Two sets of experimental kinetics are
included here, the first for the standard I- + O3 reaction (●) shown in Fig. 3, and another set
including 1.6 mM of Triton-X100 (○). The presence of the surfactant completely inhibits the
surface reaction in this case, demonstrated by agreement with the bulk-only models. For both
sets of kinetics, [O3(g,∞)] = 500 ppb, r = 17 um, and [I-]0 = 795 mM.

predictions of the “bulk” only (i.e., rd compartment) closed form expression (Eq. (21)) and
compare it with measurements of O3 + I- reaction in the presence of surfactant Triton-X 100,50
which effectively shuts off the surface reaction. The comparison shown in Fig. 5 confirms that the
closed form expressions closely replicate both the experimental data and the numerical solutions,
and thus validates the approximations used in deriving these analytic functions.
VI. Conclusions
The general approach described above establishes a framework for evaluating multiphase
chemical kinetics. Unlike previous models (see review by Kolb et al.51 and discussion in Wilson
et. al.12), which use flux-based descriptions, our approach seeks to distill multiphase chemistry
into a simple set of physically realistic elementary kinetic steps and equilibria. This kinetic
description incorporates the interfacial dynamics and solvation free energies observed in MD
simulations as well as continuum descriptions of mass transport. The resulting set of differential
equations and expressions for uptake are embedded in a coarse grain description of kinetically
relevant spatial regions in a two-phase system. The simple set of coupled differential equations,
which when solved numerically or analytically, produce predictions that can be directly compared
to experimental observations. The model provides a novel way to evaluate the contribution of
interfacial and bulk phase reactions to uptake coefficients and the overall reaction kinetics, thus
providing deeper insight into the multiphase mechanism, which is often not possible when
considering experimental results alone. This framework appears to be general and likely
transferrable to, for example, problems involving the transport of solutes across
electrolyte/membrane interfaces or chemical reactions in coacervates.52
Appendix A: Molecular and Continuum Descriptions of Gas Diffusion to an Interface
In the kinetic model described above we derive expressions that account for the diffusive
and kinetic mass transfer of X to the gas-liquid surface. The rate equation describing diffusional
transport is,

𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( 𝑐𝑚3 𝑠 ) = 𝑉 𝑐 = 𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 ⋅ [X(𝑔,∞) ]

Eq. (A1)

𝐽𝑐 (

The analogous rate equation describing kinetic or “collisional” mass transport to the interface is,

𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( 𝑐𝑚3 𝑠 ) = 𝑉 𝑘 = 𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑙 ⋅ [X𝑔,∞ ]

which is similarly recast as a first-order rate coefficient by normalizing by the approximate surface

Written out in kinetic steps, we describe the overall process using two reversible steps,

discussed. The collision rate coefficient 𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑙 is equal to the pseudo-first order adsorption rate
Γ∞

𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑙 = 𝑘𝑎𝑑𝑠 𝛿𝑋 , assuming σ =1 (see Sect. V.B).
During the net-adsorption process the diffusional transport (AR1) described above and the
interfacial adsorption process (AR2) occur simultaneously, and therefore, the concentration of
near-surface species [X (𝑔𝑠) ] has both diffusional and adsorption contributions to its steady-state
value. In the limit of complete surface loss after surface adsorption, the steady-state concentration
of [X (𝑔𝑠) ] is,

[X(𝑔,∞) ] = 𝐽 [X(𝑔,∞) ].
𝑘

Eq. (A7)

Eq. (A7) denotes the “effective” concentration of X from the perspective of the interface. During
adsorption and loss of X, the near-surface concentration [X (𝑔𝑠) ] resembles [X(𝑔,∞) ] when the radius
r is small but becomes significantly depleted when r is large—since the loss of X due to interfacial
adsorption becomes faster than what can be “replenished” by diffusional transport, which slows
with increasing r as seen in Eq. (A3). From an alternative point of view, Eq. (A7) expresses that
the near-surface gas concentration is related to the true gas concentration by a transport fractional
term that expresses how much the near-surface gas behavior resembles the “molecularity”
expected by the purely collisional description used for adsorption. As included in Eq. (A7), this
can be expressed by a simple ratio of flux terms, where the true gas flux (J) divided by a reference
flux (the molecular flux Jk in this case) provides the fractional term.
This first observation is equivalent to that of Fuchs & Sutugin33 using the method of fluxmatching to a boundary sphere of radius r + Δ for the elementary case where Δ = 0, expressed in
terms of the Knudsen number Kn =

Although the gas-transport term in Eq. (A7) and Fuchs’ expression for Δ = 0 agree exactly, the
transport Eq. (A7) can be slightly modified to agree with Fuchs’ general expression for a general
boundary sphere of r + Δ. To accomplish this, we set up a simple expression that is in fact
equivalent to Fuchs’ continuous description of boundary-sphere flux matching. We define a fluxmatching boundary condition by recognizing that the number of molecules that diffuse from the
gas phase into the near-surface region must equal the sum of the number of molecules colliding
with the droplet surface and diffusing back out into the outer gas phase,

Eq. (A13)

. This shows that the “compartmentalized”

or coupled-equilibria approach for describing near-gas concentrations within a shell of length Δ
results in exactly the results of Fuchs & Sutugin33 when integrating the steady-state condition for
the concentration profile at position r + Δ with boundary conditions set by an equivalent flux
matching condition.
Given that Eq. (A13) maps onto the description of Fuchs & Sutugin,33 this description
agrees with the “Fuchs correction” used to account for diffusional “resistance” in the widelyapplied resistor formulation of multiphase kinetics.27, 53, 54 We note, however, that the Fuchs
correction follows the expanded method outlined by Fuchs & Sutugin33 in which Eq. (A13) is
slightly adapted to agree with numerical solutions to the Boltzmann equation across the Kn range.
For completeness, we include this adapted transport term,

which includes an additional constant 0.283. We note that typically, the boundary sphere distance
Δ is typically chosen to equal approximately the mean free path 𝜆 which further simplifies Eq.
(A12). As shown in Fig. 6A, the transport terms found in Eq. (A7), Eq. (A12), and Eq. (A14) are
all numerically close to each other, differing only modestly in the transition regime.

which, when analyzed in light of mechanistic steps AR1 and AR2, yields an identical gas-tosurface transport efficiency as described by the simplest case from Fuchs & Sutugin33 with the
boundary sphere distance Δ = 0. To account for a nonzero boundary-sphere thickness Δ, the rate
coefficient for the diffusional process above can be modified to include the flux at distance r + Δ,
