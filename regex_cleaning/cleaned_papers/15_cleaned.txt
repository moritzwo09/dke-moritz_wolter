One of the most important areas of application for equation-of-motion coupled
cluster (EOM-CC) theory is the prediction, simulation, and analysis of various types
of electronic spectra. In this work, the EOM-CC method for ionized states, known
as EOM-IP-CC, is applied to the closely lying and coupled pair of states of the
ozone cation — X̃ 2 A1 and Ã2 B2 — using highly accurate treatments including up
to the full single, double, triple, and quadruple excitations (EOM-IP-CCSDTQ).
Combined with a venerable and powerful method for calculating vibronic spectra
from the Hamiltonian produced by EOM-IP-CC calculations, the simulations yield
a spectrum that is in good agreement with the photoelectron spectrum of ozone.
Importantly, the calculations suggest that the adiabatic gap separating these two
electronic states is somewhat smaller than currently thought; an assignment of the
simulated spectrum together with the more precise band positions of the experimental measurements suggests that this energy gap is 1,366±65 cm−1 .

Amongst the brotherhood of triatomic molecules, it cannot be denied that water (H2 O) is
the most important, the most highly studied, and the most well-understood. Beyond H2 O,
many triatomic molecules that have an environmental, technological or biological importance have been subjected to many studies and are understood to various levels of detail.
Perhaps the most interesting such case is ozone (O3 ), which has a vast number of important
properties, a very rich history of study1 , and unlike the relatively simple water molecule, a
profound quantum-mechanical complexity2 . Structurally, while we think of ozone as having two distinct kinds of oxygen atoms (and an NMR experiment would reveal that), the
full molecular Hamiltonian does not distinguish between them. Rather, it yields the three
equivalent structures separated by a barrier that lies tantalizingly close to the O3 → O2 +

O dissociation threshold (102.4 kJ/mol)3 , as shown in Fig. 1. In reality, the energy levels

of ozone all have a near triple (e + a) degeneracy, albeit with a tunneling splitting so small
that it can be ignored, along with a semi-infinite lifetime (despite opposing opinion4 ). More
than a half century ago, this intriguing aspect of the ozone molecule was first discussed by

J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 118, No. 14, 8 April 2003

Berry5 .

limit). The slice shows three equivalent minima corresponding to C2v structures separated by large
barriers. Reproduced with permission from Ref. 6.

Beyond the structural aspects of ozone, other mysteries surround this curious molecule.
For example, the distribution of the eighteen distinct 16 O/17 O/18 O isotopologues in the
Earth’s atmosphere differs from what is expected based on the natural isotopic abundance,
a puzzle that has been open for more than three decades6,7 .
Among quantum chemists, ozone has a notorious history, owing to its strong diradical
character causing significant difficulties in calculations of its ostensibly simple ground-state
molecular properties. An early 1989 study8,9 by the Bartlett group and collaborators found
that the CCSD+T(CCSD) method predicted that the molecular equilibrium structure of
ozone would have Cs symmetry (that is, the asymmetric stretching harmonic frequency
computed by this method is imaginary), a finding that led to a search for better treatment of
non-iterative triple excitations, ultimately leading to the well-known CCSD(T) method10–12 .
While CCSD(T) and higher-level coupled-cluster methods available today13–15 do a good job
in describing the equilibrium structure and vibrational potential, an elaborate multireference
configuration interaction calculations can describe the entire ground-state surface out to the
dissociation limit6,16,17 , facilitating calculations of spectroscopy and chemical reactions of
ozone. As such, the quantum chemical understanding and fidelity for the ground electronic
state of O3 is now at a mature level.

Qualitatively, the challenge posed to electronic structure theory by ozone ultimately arises
from its closely spaced highest-occupied (a2 ) and lowest-unoccupied (b1 ) molecular orbitals
(HOMO and LUMO, respectively; see Fig. 2), giving rise to the following wavefunction:
X 1 A1 = C1 [core]6 (3a1 )2 (2b2 )2 (4a1 )2 (5a1 )2 (3b2 )2 (1b1 )2 (4b2 )2 (6a1 )2 (1a2 )2 (2b1 )0 +

The two electron configurations [· · · ]a22 b01 and [· · · ]a02 b21 mix strongly (the weights of these
two leading configurations are C1 ≈0.952 and C2 ≈0.005, according to the EOM-SF-CCSD

(EOM-CCSD with spin-flip) calculations18 ), posing the aforementioned challenges with (especially single-reference) quantum-chemical methods. A second feature consequence of the
symmetry and energetic proximity of these two orbitals is that the ozone cation (which is
isoelectronic to the NO2 radical) has closely lying 2 A1 and 2 B2 electronic states derived by
ionization from the HOMO-1 and HOMO-2, respectively (see Fig. 2). Like the associated
states in NO2 , these two states are plagued by orbital symmetry breaking19 , a problem
that greatly complicates their quantum-chemical treatment. One of the many accomplishments of the Bartlett group has been the integral role played by them in the development
of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory20–22 (EOM-CC, also known as linear response
coupled-cluster theory23 ). These methods provide a very efficient and simple way to treat
certain classes of electronic structure that are often termed “multireference problems”24,25 ,
and are ideally suited to studying reactive intermediates, radicals, diradicals, and electronically excited states. From a somewhat wider viewpoint, the existence of closely spaced
electronic states always carries the potential for (possibly strong) vibronic coupling, a phenomenon that can play an important role in molecular dynamics and spectroscopy. Indeed,
one of the great successes of EOM-CC methods has been in their ability — if and only if
combined with vibronic coupling models — to enable high-quality simulations of complicated electronic spectra. Such work provides important insights into the nature of vibronic
coupling in molecular systems, as has been exemplified by various application studies (for
example, see Refs. 26 and 27). In the case of ozone cation, the two lowest electronic states
separated by a small gap of ∼0.1 eV are coupled by the asymmetric stretch of b2 symmetry
(Fig. 3).
The photoelectron spectrum of ozone has been reported28 in 1974. Later, much higher
resolution of the positions of vibronic peaks was obtained with pulsed-field-ionization zerokinetic-energy (PFI-ZEKE) spectroscopy29 . From the theory side, the vibronic photoelectron
spectrum of ozone was modeled with a vibronic Hamiltonian parameterized using multi-

Our contribution to this issue paying homage to the career and accomplishments of R.J.
Bartlett consists of an application of a vibronic coupling model, parametrized by EOM-CC
calculations, to the photoelectron spectrum of ozone. We trust that this combination of
methodology applied to a molecule that has been extensively studied by the Bartlett group
is an appropriate contribution.

THEORETICAL MODELS AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Ozone is a C2v molecule (following Mulliken’s convention30 , the molecule is placed in the
yz-plane and the molecular symmetry axis aligns with the z-direction) with three normal
modes: symmetric stretch, symmetric bend, and asymmetric stretch (Fig. 3). The asymmetric stretch is of b2 symmetry. The two lowest electronic states of the ozone cation, 2 A1
and 2 B2 , are very close in energy—separated by the gap of mere 0.123 eV (or 990 cm−1 )—
and can be coupled by the b2 vibration, giving rise to significant vibronic effects in the
photoelectron spectrum.
We simulate the vibronic states of the ozone cation using the model Hamiltonian of
Köppel, Domcke, and Cederbaum—the KDC Hamiltonian31–33 . This is a multi-state and
multi-mode Hamiltonian defined in the basis of diabatic states. For the ozone cation, the
basis comprises two quasi-diabatic states (related to the 2 A1 and 2 B2 states at the groundstate minimum), coupled by one mode (asymmetric stretch, mode number 3). The model
also includes two symmetric modes (modes number 1 and 2). The matrix elements of
the vibronic Hamiltonian are expanded around the equilibrium geometry of neutral ozone
using the respective dimensionless normal coordinates, Qi , and the corresponding harmonic
frequencies, ωi . The overall form of the vibronic Hamiltonian is thus:

Here E (α) are the vertical ionization energies calculated at the equilibrium geometry of
the neutral, κ are the coefficients of expansion of the potential along the fully symmetric
coordinates, and λ is the linear diabatic coupling. Fig. 4 shows the resulting diabatic
potential energy surfaces. The displacements along the two symmetric normal modes are
clearly visible, suggesting vibrational progressions along the bend and symmetric stretch.

to the 2 A1 and 2 B2 states at the equilibrium geometry of the neutral) shown as function of the two
stretching modes, Q1 and Q2 , at Q3 =0.

We computed the parameters of the KDC Hamiltonian using ab initio CC and EOMCC methods.22,24,25,34–36 We considered methods in which the CC expansion was truncated
to singles and doubles (CCSD), singles, doubles and triples (CCSDT), as well as singles,
doubles, triples and quadruples (CCSDTQ).15 We computed the geometry of the neutral
ozone and its harmonic frequencies and normal coordinates with CCSDT/ANO1.37,38
The optimized geometry of ozone has a bond length of 1.270 Å and a bond angle of
116.9◦ . The two symmetric normal modes have frequencies 1,169 cm−1 and 724 cm−1 , and
the asymmetric stretch has a frequency of 1,129 cm−1 .
We described the states of the cation using EOM-CC for ionization energies (known
as EOM-IP-CC).39 We used the definition of quasi-diabatic states by Ichino, Gauss, and
Stanton40 based on the EOM-IP-CC method (EOMIP-CC-QD). We computed the linear
diabatic coupling λ and the expansion coefficients κ at the equilibrium geometry of the
neutral; λ was computed with EOM-IP-CCSD-QD/ANO1 and κ’s were computed using
the EOM-IP-CCSD/ANO1 energies calculated on a grid. The computed value of the linear
diabatic coupling constant λ is 1,394 cm−1 . The complete set of KDC parameters is given
in the SI.
We computed the vertical ionization energies using a composite method. The starting
value is the complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation of the EOM-IP-CCSDT/cc-pCVnZ energies with n = 5, 6.41 These values were augmented with two corrections: the ∆Q correction in
the cc-pwCVTZ basis set and the relativistic correction calculated using EOM-IP-CCSD/ccpwCVTZ.42 The error bars were estimated as follows: for the extrapolated CBS reference
values, we used half of the absolute value of the difference between the best ab initio value
and the extrapolated value, and for the remaining corrections (quadruples correction, ∆Q,
and the relativistic correction) we used half of the absolute value of the correction.
To compare the simulated photoelectron spectrum to the experimental one, we used the
cross-section ratio A1 :B2 of 1:1.35.43 Additionally, the stick spectrum was broadened with
the Lorenzian envelopes normalized to the feature intensities
f (x, xi , Ii ) =
,
(x − xi )2 + (γ/2)2

(4)

where xi is the position of the spectral peak, Ii is its intensity and γ is the peak’s width.
The spectrum was computed using the xsim module in CFOUR, with the basis of 50
harmonic states in each mode and 6,000 iterations of the Lanczos procedure.44 All electrons
were correlated in all CC/EOM-CC calculations. All calculations were performed using
CFOUR.45,46

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We begin by discussing the accuracy of the computed electronic states. The vertical
ionization energy for the first excited state, E (1) , computed using the composite method
described above, is 12.827 eV. Our error estimate for this value is 30 meV (see Table I for
details). We note that the convergence of the vertical gap between the two states is much
faster and this value is estimated as 123±8 meV (see Table II for details).

Figure 5 compares the simulated spectrum to the lower-resolution experimental spectrum
taken from Ref. 28. Peak A is known to be a hot band, and does not appear in our (0 K)
simulation.43 The simulation reproduces well the consecutive increase in the intensities of
peaks B, C, D, and E as well as the spacing between these peaks. The drop in the intensity
at peak F is captured by the simulation. Starting from peak G, the simulation shows
discrepancy with the experiment. A sudden drop in the intensity past peak H is not observed
in the simulation. We discuss a likely source of this mismatch below.

Our simulation allows for an additional element of analysis—Figure 6 shows a decomposition of the simulated spectrum from Figure 5. All lines that contribute to the spectrum
are marked individually and are color-coded indicating which electronic state’s transition
intensity the peak draws from. The total envelope of the spectrum is also decomposed
showing contributions from both states. Our simulation locates the minimum of the conical
intersection (marked as CI) at 3,174 cm−1 above the origin (12.92 eV).
We assigned the vibronic peaks using a comparison to the Franck-Condon simulation.
To this end, the spectrum is simulated once again, this time, however, setting the linear
diabatic constant to zero (λ= 0). This yields the spectra of the two electronic states at an
equivalent level of theory but without vibronic coupling, i.e., the combined Franck-Condon
spectra of the two states. Figure 7 shows this spectrum. The non-coupled spectrum is easy

to assign using the labels that mark the symmetry of the electronic state, A1 or B2 , and
the vibrational state (ν1 ν2 ν3 ), where νi is the number of quanta in mode i (i = 1 for the
symmetric stretch, i = 2 for the symmetric bend and i = 3 for the asymmetric stretch). The
assigned spectrum shows progressions in the symmetric bend. There is one such progression
in each electronic state. Additionally for each state, there is also another progression in the
symmetric bend with one excitation in the symmetric stretch.
The decomposition of the spectrum presented on Figure 6 provides additional insight.
The spectrum shows that peaks B and C are almost purely of the 2 A1 electronic and a1
vibrational character. Starting from the peak D, the contributions from two states are
of equal magnitude. It is also clear that the following peaks comprise mixtures of many
vibronic peaks. At the energy of about 2,000 cm−1 above the origin the density of vibronic

peaks increases significantly. This value can be compared to the minimum of the conical
intersection located at about 1,000 cm−1 above the origin. Our Hamiltonian is not suitable
for describing dissociation of the molecule, therefore, we expect a discrepancy with the
experiment as the energy gets closer to the dissociation threshold located at 4,898±3 cm−1
above the origin.29
Figure 8 shows the assigned spectrum and Table III lists the decomposition of all peaks
in the region of up to 3100 cm−1 . We compare the resulting assignment with the highresolution PFI-ZEKE spectrum from Ref. 29. The PFI-ZEKE spectrum is the best source
of information on the location of the peaks, especially the origin, against which the origin
peak of the simulation is aligned. The origin of the simulated spectrum is red-shifted by
170 cm−1 relative to the experimental origin at 101,020.5 cm−1 .29 This discrepancy is within
our error estimate for the vertical ionization energy (30 meV=240 cm−1 ).
The comparison with the high-resolution spectrum (Fig. 8) reveals more details. Lines
of the PFI-ZEKE experiment and our simulation match very well. Especially the states
of the A1 symmetry are well aligned with the experimental features. States close to the

origin are similar to the non-coupled states. The origin peak is of A1 (0,0,0) character, the
first two excitations in the symmetric bend, A1 (0,1,0) and A1 (0,2,0) are also very similar to
the non-coupled states, whereas the higher excitations in this progression show significant
mixing. The same progression with one vibrational quanta in the symmetric stretch is more
interesting. The first of its peaks is very well aligned with experimentally visible feature,
which was previously assigned as the origin of the second electronic state. The second peak
in this series, A1 (1,1,0), has very high similarity to its uncoupled version. It is a good
candidate to assign the experimental, unassigned feature above 102,600 cm−1 .
States of the B2 symmetry, on the other hand, do not align well with the experiment.
The first such peak, close to the 12.64 eV mark in Figure 8, is assigned to the A1 (0,0,1)
state. This is a vibronic state that gains intensity owing to the coupling to the electronic
B2 state. This vibronic peak lies in the part of the spectrum where bands of oxygen (which

appears as impurity in the gas sample) are visible in the experiment. The origin of the 2 B2
state is very similar to the uncoupled B2 (0,0,0) state, but it is located in an empty area
of the experimental spectrum. The next peak, slightly above a 12.76 eV mark in Figure 8,
corresponds to the one excitation of the symmetric bend in the 2 B2 state, but as the label
on the figure shows, it is only about 55% similar to the uncoupled state.
Finally, Figure 9 compares our spectrum to an earlier accurate simulation using multireference configuration interaction by Tarroni and Carter29 . The comparison includes only

the lines from the earlier simulation that were tabulated with an assignment. The comparison
to the earlier simulation in Figure 9 shows that both match well with the experiment. Both
simulations also agree in the assignment of the first progression in the bending mode. The
previous simulation, however, shows smaller spacing between the remaining lines, yielding
much higher congestion of the spectrum. Additionally, the origin of the second state falls
at lower energy aligns well with the peak that was assigned in the PFI-ZEKE experiment
also as the origin of the second state. While an additional simulation of the line intensities
would allow for the most complete comparison to the experimental spectrum, the strong
alignment of the simulated peaks of a A1 symmetry with the experimental features leads us
to believe that our simulation offers the best assignment of the spectrum to date.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this exploration of the photoelectron spectrum of the ozone molecule, we have deployed cutting-edge high-order CC models together with a vibronic Hamiltonian approach
to spectroscopy beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation31–33 . We parameterized the
Hamiltonian using EOM-IP-CC calculations and the formalism of quasi-diabatic states of
Ichino, Gauss and Stanton.40 The results of the simulation are in excellent agreement with
the experimental spectrum from the ionization energy of the lower state to about 2,500 cm−1
higher (the restriction arising from the local parametrization of the Hamiltonian). Analysis

of the spectrum and its simulation underscore the importance of vibronic coupling effects in
the ozone cation. Results of this work offer a state-of-the-art insight into the details of the
spectrum and allows for an assignment of the experimental results. Simulated peaks that
gain intensity from the ÃB2 state are absent in the PFI-ZEKE spectrum which offers an
interesting avenue for further investigations.
