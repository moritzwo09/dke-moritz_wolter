The ozone oxidation, or ozonation, of thiosulfate is an important reaction for wastewater
processing, where it is used for remediation of mining effluents, and for studying aerosol chemistry,
where its fast reaction rate makes it an excellent model reaction. Although thiosulfate ozonation
has been studied since the 1950’s, challenges remain in developing a realistic reaction
mechanism that can satisfactorily account for all observed products with a sequence of
elementary reaction steps. Here, we present novel measurements using trapped microdroplets to
study the pH-dependent thiosulfate ozonation kinetics. We detect known products and
intermediates, including SO32-, SO42-, S3O62-, and S4O62-, establishing agreement with the
literature. However, we identify S2O42- as a new reaction intermediate, and find that the currently
accepted mechanism does not directly explain observed pH effects. Thus, we develop a new
mechanism, which incorporates S2O42- as an intermediate and uses elementary steps to explain
the pH-dependence of thiosulfate ozonation. The proposed mechanism is tested using a kinetic
model benchmarked to the experiments presented here, then compared to literature data. We
demonstrate good agreement between the proposed thiosulfate ozonation mechanism and
experiments, suggesting that the insights in this paper can be leveraged in wastewater treatment
and in understanding potential climate impacts.

This study addresses the pH-dependent ozone oxidation of thiosulfate, a reaction with
applications in mining wastewater remediation and aerosol chemistry.

Thiosalts, or incompletely oxidized sulfur compounds, have recently been classified as
contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) due to their indirect aquatic toxicity. As such, a need
for more complete thiosalt reaction mechanisms has been identified. 1 Thiosalts are formed in
volcanic craters2, 3 and hydrothermal vents4 via the reaction between H2S and SO2 in aqueous
environments (Figure 1A). They can also be formed in mines due to the incomplete oxidation of
sulfur during the processing of sulfur-containing ores (Figure 1B) such as pyrite (FeS2).1, 5 Waste,
often called “the tailing”, is transferred (Figure 1C) to tailing storage facilities (TSFs) and treated
prior to release into the natural environment (Figure 1D). Typical thiosalt concentrations produced
during mining operations are likely highly variable due to differences in mining practices and
regulations, but one study by Rolia and Tan in 1985 measured concentrations from ~4 to 18 mM.6
Due to their lack of direct toxicity, thiosalts are often left to naturally oxidize during storage, but
sensitivity to the TSF environment can result in incomplete oxidization.5, 7-9 When the TSF then
releases the tailings, or is decommissioned, remaining thiosalts enter the environment, where
further oxidation by air, bacteria, and sunlight is linked to increased acidic toxicity in natural
waters.1, 5, 8, 10-12 Furthermore, these TSFs can have poor regulation, which has led to catastrophic
breaches (Figure 1E) including the Córrego do Feijão iron ore mine in Brazil.13 As such, TSFs
have recently come under scrutiny, and improved thiosalt oxidation processes may be required
to meet new regulations.14

Thiosulfate (S2O32-), trithionate (S3O62-), and tetrathionate (S4O62-) are all common thiosalts in
mining effluents, with thiosulfate being the most common.5, 10 Recently, the use of ozone
microbubbles for mining water treatment appears to be gaining momentum, with multiple recent
laboratory and pilot studies,9, 20, 21 but the currently accepted reaction mechanism is incomplete.
Specifically, Takizawa et al.22 demonstrated that the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate produces
multiple products in neutral environments, but selectively produces sulfate in alkaline
environments, which the currently accepted mechanism cannot fully explain. The exact speciation
of thiosalts can be important for predicting environmental impacts, thus the role of pH in the ozone
oxidation of thiosulfate must be better understood.1, 5

Thiosulfate is also used as a quenching agent in ozonation studies,23 as a scavenger in ozone
uptake studies,24, 25 and its reaction with ozone is used to study aerosol chemistry.26, 27 Aerosols,
and their rich chemistry, remain one of the largest uncertainties in global climate modeling,28 and
the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate is fast, making it an excellent model reaction to study aerosol
processing.26, 27 In the natural environment, aqueous aerosols are formed by waves breaking over
any large body of water (Figure 1F and G).16 These aerosols can persist for days to weeks,
undergoing several transformations, including changes in pH (Figure 1H).18 Once in the
atmosphere, fully oxidized thiosulfate (i.e., sulfate) can have significant effects on climate
forcing,29 and incompletely oxidized thiosulfate may encounter ozone, resulting in the downstream
production of sulfate.
Although it has not been directly investigated, thiosulfate may also form in long-lived (up to 3
years) stratospheric aerosols formed during volcanic eruptions, which will contain H2S, SO2, and
water (Figure 1I).19 Stratospheric aerosol injections (SAI), which mimic volcanic eruptions, have
been proposed as a geoengineering effort to offset climate change, meaning the oxidation of
thiosalts may have significant implications for any such SAIs. The pH-dependent reaction
mechanism for the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate will thus be important for the mining community,
the atmospheric chemistry community, and potential SAI designs.
The currently accepted reaction mechanism invokes three primary reaction steps:22, 26, 27

𝑆2 𝑂32− + 𝑂3 → 𝑆2 𝑂62−

SO2 in water can then form bisulfite and sulfite via a coupled equilibrium:30


𝑆𝑂2 + 𝐻2 𝑂 ⇄ 𝐻𝑆𝑂3− + 𝐻 + ⇄ 𝑆𝑂32− + 2 𝐻 + ,

R4

which is governed by the pKa of hydrated SO2 (1.8) and the pKa of bisulfate (7.2).30 Finally, sulfite
can react with ozone to form sulfate or undergo a reversible disproportionation reaction with
tetrathionate:22, 27, 31

𝑆4 𝑂62− + 𝑆𝑂32− ⇄ 𝑆3 𝑂62− + 𝑆2 𝑂32−

R5

However, this mechanism does not account for the pH-dependent product distributions
demonstrated by Takizawa, et al.22, instead requiring branching ratio assumptions between
reactions R1-R3.
Furthermore, Hsu, et al.27 showed that the reaction may be enhanced at droplet surfaces,
which we hypothesize could be due to the surface enrichment of ozone. Ozone is relatively
insoluble in bulk water but can be up to 100 times more concentrated at the water surface
compared with the bulk.32 Thus, bulk reactions between thiosulfate and ozone are likely diffusionlimited, while the overall mechanism is likely reaction-limited in environments with high surfaceto-volume ratios (e.g., ozone microbubble processing and atmospheric aerosols).
Here, we study the pH-dependent ozone oxidation of thiosulfate in levitated microdroplets,
replicating the high surface-to-volume ratio of ozone microbubble processing and atmospheric
aerosol environments. We study the reaction as a function of gas-phase ozone concentration and
bulk-solution pH to replicate the varied mining and/or natural environments. Measured pHdependent reaction kinetics are used to propose a new, more detailed mechanism for the ozone
oxidation of thiosulfate and the proposed mechanism is benchmarked against the experiments
presented here. Finally, the proposed mechanism is compared to prior literature data to ensure
that the proposed mechanism explains both droplet and bulk chemistry.

A quadrupole electrodynamic trap (QET) is used to trap and react arrays of microdroplets,
which are then individually analyzed by mass spectrometry with an open-port sampling interface
(OPSI-MS),33-38 as previously utilized by Wilson and co-workers.32, 34, 39, 40 As shown in Figure 2,
the QET is housed in an environmentally controlled chamber and droplets are subjected to a
constant flow (550 cm3 min-1) of humidified N2, O2, and O3 at room temperature (295 K).
Microdroplets are generated co-axially to the QET trapping rods by a piezo-electric dispenser
(Microfab, MJ-ABP-01) with a 30 μm orifice and charged with a +450 V DC bias by an induction
electrode immediately after generation. 10s to 100s of droplets can be trapped in the upper QET
region and individually transferred to the lower QET region for sizing. Mie scattering is used to
size the droplets by illuminating them with a 532 nm laser.44


connected to the solvent source and an axial inner tube leading to the mass spectrometer. The
inner tube is connected to a Thermo-Fischer HESI-II heated-electrospray source, where sheath
gas flow over the inner tube in the HESI creates a pressure differential, drawing the solvent and
analyte into the analysis region of the Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer
Scientific, Inc.). The solvent delivery rate (typically ~4.5 mL h-1) is slightly higher than the rate of
solvent flow into the MS, creating a stable flow33 and a small solvent pool that catches ejected
microdroplets, dilutes their contents, and carries analytes to the MS.
Reference spectra of thiosulfate, sulfate, sulfite, tetrathionate, and trithionate in unreacted
microdroplets were used to identify the characteristic ions, including fragmentation products, for
each species (S1 in Supporting Information). Mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) for individual species
are then tracked over time, providing a time-series of ‘droplet detection events’ (Figure S9 in the
Supporting Information). Peak areas for each species are used to quantify the respective
concentrations within the microdroplets; calibration curves at each pH for each species are shown
in S2 in the Supporting Information.
The droplet chamber environment was controlled by a humidified mixture of O 2, O3, and N2.
10 cm3 min-1 of oxygen was supplied to a corona discharge ozone generator and the resulting
O2/O3 mixture was diluted into 2.5-5 L min-1 of nitrogen. 50 cm3 min-1 of the diluted flow was
combined with 500 cm3 min-1 of humidified nitrogen, and the total flow (550 cm3 min-1 of O2, O3,
and N2) was introduced to the QET. Before dispensing the droplets, the environmental chamber
was equilibrated with the ozone generator off, which provided a humidified gas flow of up to 8
ppm O2 in N2. During reaction, droplets were exposed to a constant flow of 1-6 ppm of gas-phase
ozone (O3), measured by a UV ozone analyzer (2B Technologies, model 106-M). The gas flow is
blocked from entering the OPSI except for ~4 s during droplet ejection events, and no indications
of gas-phase chemistry within the ESI were observed.


Fresh solutions were prepared daily using HPLC-grade water (Sigma-Aldrich), Na2S2O3
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%), malonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), Lglycine (≥99%), HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 37%) and NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%). All droplets were
dispensed from an aqueous 250 mM sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) solution, the lowest
concentration that afforded a reasonable detection range throughout reactions. Solutions at pH 5
were buffered with 1 M malonic acid-NaOH and solutions at pH 9 were buffered with 1 M glycineHCl. Buffers were chosen for their potential environmental relevance and effective buffering
ranges. Reaction R3 and the subsequent hydrolysis of SO2 described in the introduction suggest
that up to two protons may be generated for each thiosulfate molecule consumed, meaning that
up to 0.5 M H+ could be produced. Buffer concentrations were therefore set to 1 M. Solutions with
pH 13 were pH-adjusted using concentrated NaOH and were unbuffered due to the lack of viable
buffers in this range. Regardless, no trithionate or tetrathionate were detected during the
experiments, indicating no significant change in pH.22 We also note that although glycine and OHwill react with ozone,41, 42 the rate constants and relative concentrations compared with thiosulfate
are small enough that these reactions are negligible in these experiments, see S3 in Supporting
Information.
The relative humidity in the QET was set to 95 ± 1% and measured at the beginning of each
reaction. When the water activity of the droplets matched the relative humidity in the QET (𝑎𝑤 =
0.95), the dispenser produced droplets with r = 25 ± 1 μm. The pH 9 solution required ~300 mM
NaCl to lower the water activity to the desired level; no additional salt was required for the pH 5
and pH 13 solutions. Droplet sizes did not significantly change throughout the reaction.

Kinetic mechanisms are benchmarked against experimental data using Kinetiscope©, a
stochastic kinetics simulation software package, previously used by Wilson and co-workers.43-45

Kinetiscope© uses a Monte Carlo approach to simulating chemical kinetics where concentrations
are propagated in time using the probabilities for each reaction step. The reaction mechanism is
included as a series of discrete steps with rate constants and diffusion coefficients constrained by
literature values (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Those not explicitly constrained by the
literature are discussed here. When simulating reaction kinetics in microdroplets, we implement
the geometric corrections developed by Willis, et al.40 which account for surface-to-volume ratio
and partitioning of solutes between the interface and the bulk (S5 in Supporting Information).
Briefly, all species can adsorb to the water surface from the gas phase or from the bulk
environment. Once adsorbed to the interface, species can react, desorb to the gas phase, or
desorb into the bulk. The equilibrium values for the concentrations of adsorbed species are taken
from literature where possible, and we employ Deep-UV Second Harmonic Generation (DUVSHG) spectroscopy to directly probe thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfate at the air-water interface (S4
in Supporting Information).

Ozone oxidation of thiosulfate (m/z = 113 and 135) was studied as a function of pH and gasphase ozone concentration using levitated microdroplets as described in methods.
Representative mass spectra are shown in Figure 3.

Previous studies22, 26, 27 identified sulfate (SO42-), dithionate (S2O62-), trithionate (S3O62-), and
tetrathionate (S4O62-) as reaction products and sulfite (SO32-) as a reaction intermediate. Here, we
identify SO42- (m/z = 97 and 119), S3O62- (m/z = 80, 112, 193, and 215), and S4O62- (m/z = 80, 144,
225, and 247) as reaction products and SO32- (m/z = 65 and 95) as a reaction intermediate,
demonstrating consistency with prior studies. Additionally, we identify dithionite (S2O42-, m/z = 64)
as a reaction intermediate, which had not been previously detected. However, the bulk-phase
experiments performed by Takizawa, et al.22 utilized titration to identify each of the
known/expected products, and since dithionite is relatively unstable in aqueous environments with
dissolved oxygen any dithionite formed likely decomposed before it could be identified. Similarly,
the droplet experiments performed by Hsu, et al.27 used Raman spectroscopy, which would not
be able to distinguish dithionite from other sulfur oxyanion species. Thus, dithionite was likely
present in both the bulk-phase Takizawa, et al.22 and droplet Hsu, et al.27 studies, but undetectable
due to the methods used. Finally, we do not identify dithionate (expected m/z = 161 and 183) as
a significant reaction product (S1 in Supporting Information). Mixed results in the literature22, 26, 27
suggest that dithionate is only a minor product, if present at all, and thus will not be included in
further discussions here.
Integrated OPSI-MS intensities converted to concentrations (S1 and S2 in Supporting
Information) are used to asses product yields and sulfur loss (S9 in Supporting Information). The
aqueous products measured here account for ~85% of the reacted sulfur at pH 5, ~60% of the
reacted sulfur at pH 9, and ~65% of the reacted sulfur at pH 13. The remaining sulfur may be lost
as gas-phase products (e.g., SO2), elemental sulfur, and/or experimental error 6, 22, 46 (S9 in


Supporting Information). Given that we cannot directly measure gas-phase products, we use the
umbrella term ‘S loss’ to discuss SO2 evaporation and any other loss mechanisms.

Reaction kinetics are obtained by analyzing a droplet every 1-2 minutes. Representative
kinetic information for experiments with high ozone concentrations (5.39 ppm at pH 5, 4.18 ppm
at pH 9 and 5.24 ppm at pH 13) are shown in Figure 4. Experiments (points) are compared with
simulation results (lines), which will be discussed in Section 4. The first 20 minutes of reaction
time are shown here for clarity; detailed reaction kinetics for all experiments are shown in S6 in
Supporting Information.

Experiment results are shown as points representing the average of 5 individual runs with error
bars representing the standard deviation of each set. The net loss calculated via sulfur closure is
shown as ‘S loss’ (orange circle) in the top panels; see S9 in Supporting Information for more
details. Simulation results are shown as lines. The calculated amount of SO2 lost to the gas phase
is shown as an orange line in the top panel for pH 5. Green points and lines represent both S2O42and HS2O4- as these cannot be distinguished in experiments. Species not shown for a given pH
were not detected at a significant concentration by experiments and were not predicted to form at
a significant concentration by simulations.
Several qualitative features are observed. At early reaction times, thiosulfate is the limiting
reactant, and thiosulfate decay is first order with respect to gas-phase ozone concentration (i.e.,
increases linearly with ozone). This is shown by fitting the first 1-10 minutes of reaction data,
shown in the top panels of Figure 4 and Figures S16-S19 in Supporting Information, with an ‘initial
thiosulfate decay rate’. The calculated initial thiosulfate decay rates shown in Figure 5 increase
linearly with gas-phase ozone concentration. This is consistent with previous studies, which
showed that the overall reaction rate is first order with respect to aqueous thiosulfate and gasphase ozone concentrations.24, 25 Figure 5 also shows that initial thiosulfate decay rates are
inversely proportional to dispensed solution pH, which has not been explicitly noted in the
literature and is not readily explained by the currently accepted mechanism (e.g., R1-R3).

bars representing the standard deviation of each set. Simulation results are shown as dashed
lines extended to zero. More detailed comparisons of thiosulfate decay kinetics as a function of
ozone concentration at a given pH are shown in S6 in Supporting information.

Next, we discuss reaction intermediates (middle panels of Figure 4). S2O42- (green) points
represent the sum of S2O42- and HS2O4- and SO32- (grey) represent the sum of SO32- and HSO3as we cannot distinguish protonated forms from deprotonated forms in the mass spectra used
here. We can, however, make some assumptions using the known pKa values for each species.
Given that the pKa for dithionite is 2.44,47 we do not expect a significant amount of HS2O4- to be
present at any of the pH values studied here. However, the pKa for HSO3- is 7.2,30 meaning a
significant concentration of HSO3- could be present during pH 5 reactions although we cannot
detect it (S1 in Supporting Information).
Regardless of exact speciation, a significant amount of dithionite (S2O42-) is detected across
the pH values, and a significant amount of sulfite (SO32-) is detected at pH 9 and pH 13. Sulfite is
known to react rapidly with ozone to form sulfate48 (SO42-) but must compete with thiosulfate
(S2O32-) for available ozone, slowing down its consumption while thiosulfate is still present.
Dithionite (S2O42-) is not included in the currently accepted mechanism, but it is known to
decompose in water with relatively slow reaction rates47, 49 and decompose much faster with O2.50
Finally, we discuss reaction product dependance on pH. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that
sulfate (SO42-, red) is detected at all pH values, but tetrathionate (S4O62-, purple) is only detected
at pH 5 and neither trithionate (S3O62-, blue) nor tetrathionate are detected at pH 13. This suggests
that the formation of trithionate and tetrathionate are pH-dependent, which is consistent with the
Takizawa, et al.22 bulk studies. The currently accepted reaction mechanism invokes a
disproportionation reaction between tetrathionate (S4O62-) and sulfite (SO32-) to produce trithionate
(S3O62-). This could explain the presence of trithionate at pH 5 but appears inconsistent with the
pH 9 data, which shows trithionate without tetrathionate. Furthermore, we used ATR spectroscopy


to measure the disproportionation rate of tetrathionate and sulfite (S8 in Supporting Information),
but the measured rate did not explain the kinetic trends shown in Figure 4 when included in the
kinetic model.

We propose a more detailed mechanism in Scheme 1, which includes the newly identified
reaction intermediate, dithionite (S2O42-). The proposed mechanism is also pH-dependent,
eliminating the need to assume branching ratios for R1-R3, includes a trithionate (S3O62-)
production pathway that does not rely on tetrathionate (S4O62-) as a reaction intermediate, and
includes a multistep tetrathionate production pathway instead of the single step invoked in R1.

Nucleophile-ozone adducts, called primary ozonides, are commonly identified in reactions
with organics, and there is increasing evidence of their presence in inorganic reactions.
Specifically, an ozonide intermediate has been observed for bromide ozonation,51 invoked to
explain the pH-dependance of iodide ozonation,34 and calculated using ab initio methods for

sulfite ozonation.52 By analogy, the first step in the mechanism proposed here is the formation of
an ozone-thiosulfate adduct, [O3S2OOO]2-, with potential structures and decay mechanisms
based on the work of Liu, et al.52 (S7 in Supporting Information). Using this framework, we write
the subsequent reaction steps for thiosulfate plus ozone as:

𝑘1𝑏

[O3 S2 OOO]2− → S2 O2−
4 + O2
𝑘1𝑐

[O3 S2 OOOH]− → HS2 O−
4 + O2

R6
R7

Initial attempts at modeling the proposed mechanism showed that an additional pH-dependent
source of SO2 and SO42- was needed to explain the rapid production of sulfate at early reaction
times. Thus, we propose a third decomposition pathway, discussed further in S7 of Supporting
Information:

𝑘1𝑎

+
O3 S2 OOO2− + H + → SO2−
4 + SO2 + H

R8

Subsequent reaction steps are taken from the literature or inferred from stoichiometry and
experimental results. S2O42- and HS2O4- are a conjugate pair with pKa = 2.44, denoted by K1 in
Scheme 1.47 Aqueous dithionite is rapidly oxidized by oxygen, with rate constant k2a, to form
sulfate and SO2.50 SO2 can evaporate, with rate constant kdesorb, or be solvated, forming pHdependent coupled equilibria with bisulfite (SO2 + H2O ⇄ HSO3- + H+, pKa = 1.8) and sulfite (HSO3⇄ SO32- + H+, pKa = 7.2), denoted K2K3.30 Sulfite and bisulfite can both be further oxidized, with
rate constant kSO3,eff, by ozone to form sulfate (SO42-).48 In the absence of oxygen, S2O42- is known
to form trithionate (S3O62-) via multiple reactions with the final step:49

-

HS2 O−
4 + HSO3 → S3 O6 + H2 O

R9

However, it is unclear whether this is an elementary reaction step as two reactants with the same
charge are likely to repel each other, and we observe only a weak dependance on pH for
trithionate formation. Thus, we propose a similar reaction using the conjugates of HS2O4- and
HSO3-:

𝑘2𝑏

2−
S2 O2−
4 + SO2 → S3 O6 ,

R10

which would have a complex pH-dependence. At pH 5, there is likely a mixture of HS2O4- and
S2O42- and a mixture of SO2 and HSO3-, maybe even some SO32-. As the pH increases to pH 9,
the acid equilibria will shift so that there is more S2O42-, but less SO2, resulting in similar overall
reaction rates, which is consistent with the trithionate (S3O62-) production shown in Figure 4. As
the pH further increases to pH 13, [SO2] is likely negligible, shutting off trithionate production.
To our knowledge, the only relevant tetrathionate (S4O62-) formation mechanism in the
literature is written as the stoichiometric reaction step R1.22 This reaction step is difficult to model
as it requires a third order rate constant, which has not been measured, and does not explain pHdependent production of tetrathionate shown here. Thus, we propose:
𝑘2𝑐

which would be affected by the pKa of HS2O4- (2.44).
The proposed mechanism in Scheme 1 can be improved by future investigations targeting the
proposed ozonide structures and the formation mechanisms for trithionate (S3O62-) and
tetrathionate (S4O62-). Nevertheless, the proposed mechanism is largely based on known species

and reactions,30, 47-50 incorporates much of the currently accepted chemistry,22, 26, 27 and can better
explain the pH-dependent ozone oxidation of thiosulfate (S2O32-).


The proposed mechanism in Scheme 1 is incorporated into the Kinetiscope© model and
reaction conditions (e.g., [O3(gas)] and [S2O32-]0) are set to match those used in experiments. All
rate constants are constrained by literature values (Table S3 in Supporting Information) except
𝑘1𝑏 , 𝑘2𝑏 , and 𝑘2𝑐 , corresponding to reactions R6, R10, and R11, respectively, which are fit to the
experimental data presented here (S10 in Supporting Information).
Simulated pH-dependent results (Figure 4), simulated ozone-dependent results (S6 in
Supporting Information), and simulated initial rates of thiosulfate decay (Figure 5) all agree with
experiments, especially for pH 5, pH 9, and at higher ozone concentrations. The simulated
thiosulfate decay kinetics deviate slightly from experimental values for pH 13 and for pH 9 with
low ozone concentrations ([O3(gas)] < 3 ppm), which may be linked to sulfur loss mechanisms not
accounted for by the proposed mechanism (S9 in Supporting Information) and by decreased
experimental accuracy at long reaction times. On the other hand, the simulation reproduces the
shape of the dithionite (S2O42-) intermediate kinetics (Figure 4, middle panels, green) at all three
pH values, which provides significant confidence in the proposed mechanism, where S2O42- and
HS2O4- have a significant role. As mentioned previously, we are unable to detect HSO3- using
OPSI-MS, and attempts to record reference spectra for dithionite (S2O42-) demonstrated that
dithionite rapidly decomposes to form sulfite (SO32-), possibly even within the OPSI-MS. Despite
this, the simulation and experimental results for pH 13 agree, and the pH 5 simulation calculated
negligible concentrations of sulfite (SO32-) and bisulfite (HSO3-), suggesting that our insensitivity
to bisulfite does not interfere with the overall kinetic understanding.

Simulation and experimental results also show reasonable agreement for trithionate (S3O62-),
and tetrathionate (S4O62-) production across all three pH values and for sulfate (SO42-) production
at pH 5. Deviations for sulfate kinetics at pH 9 and pH 13 are likely due to limitations in modeling
SO2 evaporation and equilibria (S5.3 in Supporting Information). We find that the final
concentration of sulfate (SO42-) is sensitive to the kinetics of SO2 and the simple kinetic modeling
of SO2 used here likely does not fully capture its behavior. Regardless, the simulation shows good
agreement for pH 5 and acceptable agreement for pH 9 and pH 13. The simulation also shows
close agreement with experiments for the other products, trithionate (S3O62-) and tetrathionate
(S4O62-). Specifically, the simulation accurately captures the kinetics and final concentration at pH
values where these products are observed and accurately predicts negligible concentrations for
each at pH values where these products are not observed.
Overall, the proposed mechanism accurately captures the kinetics of the ozone oxidation of
thiosulfate experiments presented here, and predicts kinetic changes due to pH, which could not
be explained using the previously accepted mechanism.

We compare the proposed mechanism in Scheme 1 to literature data for the ozone oxidation
of thiosulfate in bulk solution22 and ~3 um droplets.27 Takizawa, et al.22 studied the bulk ozone
oxidation of thiosulfate by bubbling mixed O2/O3 through the reaction vessel and extracting
aliquots every 30 minutes for analysis. The reaction was studied in a neutral pH-unadjusted
solution and in alkaline solution as shown in Figure 6.

Simulation results (lines) using the proposed mechanism in Scheme 1 and experimental
parameters from Takizawa, et al.22 ([O3(gas)] and [S2O32-]0) are also shown in Figure 6. We use the
same bulk reaction steps and rates as Section 4.1 (shown as reaction steps B1-B10 in Table S3
in Supporting Information), except for the rate constants for reaction steps R10 (𝑘2𝑏 ) and R11
(𝑘2𝑐 ) when simulating the neutral data (Figure 6, A & B). The Takizawa, et al.22 solutions were not
buffered, and the authors note that over the course of the reaction, the pH of the ‘neutral’ solution
changed dramatically, dropping to pH 1-2, which corresponds to a 5- to 6- order of magnitude
decrease in [H+]. Although the mechanism proposed here is pH-dependent, explicitly modeling
pH is computationally expensive due to the low concentrations of H+ relative to other reactants.
We circumvent this issue by using a steady-state assumption for [H+], which is accurate for our
buffered solutions but will not adequately represent kinetics in these unbuffered solutions.

We thus use ‘effective’ rates for trithionate (S3O62-) and tetrathionate (S4O62-) production and
𝑒𝑓𝑓

𝑒𝑓𝑓

find that using 𝑘2𝑏 = 1 𝑥 10−16 𝑐𝑚3 · 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐 −1 · 𝑠 −1 and 𝑘2𝑐 = 3 𝑥 10−17 𝑐𝑚3 · 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐 −1 · 𝑠 −1 for
reactions R10 and R11, respectively, adequately reproduce the Takizawa, et al.22 experiments
(Figure 6B). To explain the difference in these effective rates, we discuss how changing pH would
affect trithionate and tetrathionate production. As the pH decreases from 7 to 1, [HS2O4-] will
𝑒𝑓𝑓

increase, resulting in the higher 𝑘2𝑐 used here. Similarly, [SO2] will increase, which could
increase trithionate production. However, the pKa of HS2O4- is higher (2.44)47 than that of solvated
aqueous SO2 (1.8),30 meaning that Δ[S2O42-] is likely greater than Δ[SO2] resulting in the lower
𝑒𝑓𝑓

𝑘2𝑏 used here.
In alkaline solution (Figure 6, C & D), the pH likely does not significantly change, as NaOH
was added in sufficient concentrations to neutralize any acidification due to reaction.22 We assume
the alkaline solution to be at pH 13 for simulations given the similarities in product yields between
the alkaline Takizawa, et al.22 experiment (Figure 6, C & D) and the pH 13 experiments presented
here (Figure 4, right column). Thus, simulations of the bulk alkaline data accurately capture
reaction kinetics using the same rate constants used in Section 4.1. Despite uncontrolled pH in
the Takizawa, et al.22 experiments, the simulation results shown in Figure 6 accurately predict the
bulk kinetics using the proposed mechanism with effective rate constants, especially early times
when the pH changes are small.
Finally, we compare our proposed mechanism with the trapped droplet experiments from Hsu,
et al.27 Compared with our experiments, Hsu, et al.27 study the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate in
much smaller droplets (~25 μm vs. up to 4 μm). Given the enhanced role of geometry in smaller
droplets, a complete analysis of the Hsu, et al.27 data using our simulations is beyond the scope
of this paper and will be included in future work exploring interfacial effects. Here, we test the
simulation against one data set from Hsu, et al.27, finding reasonable agreement between the
experiments and model (S11 in Supporting Information).

Kinetic modeling offers additional insights into the reaction mechanism. First, thiosulfate
(S2O32-) decay during ozonation is decoupled from downstream reactions at higher pH values but
is heavily modulated by tetrathionate production (Reaction R11 labeled with k2c in Scheme 1) at
lower pH values. Tetrathionate production is in direct competition with the acid/base equilibrium
of HS2O4- to S2O42-, which has a pKa (2.44).47 However, [S2O32-] is much larger than [HS2O4-] at
the pH values studied here, resulting in overall reaction rates that favor tetrathionate production
at pH 5 (Figure 4) and pH 7 (Figure 6), which affects the overall reaction stoichiometry. Specifically,
simulations show that thiosulfate and ozone molecules are consumed in a 1:1 ratio at pH 9 and
13, where R11 is shut off, but in a 1.1:1 ratio at pH 5, where R11 is active.
Second, anoxic S2O42- decomposition occurs too slowly to explain the observed kinetics but
incorporating the oxygen-assisted decomposition of S2O42- in the kinetic model matches the
observed kinetics. This means that dissolved oxygen can also modulate the ozone oxidation of
thiosulfate, changing product yields.
Finally, it is worth noting that the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate may be mediated by air-water
interfaces. In particular, the proposed reaction mechanism involves three species (O3, O2, and
SO2) that will have gas-interface-bulk diffusion equilibria coupled with their reaction kinetics.
Significant work has been performed to understand reaction-diffusion equilibria for ozone as a
reactant,32 but future work can focus on other gases, especially those that act as reactive
intermediates.

Using OPSI-MS to probe the reaction of thiosulfate and ozone in droplets over time provided
a new level of detail regarding the reaction kinetics. We directly identified an additional reaction
intermediate, dithionite (S2O42-), and proposed a new pH-dependent reaction mechanism, which
can be used to understand product speciation. Kinetic modeling of the proposed mechanism

demonstrated excellent agreement with the droplet experiments presented here, literature droplet
experiments,27 and literature bulk experiments.22 The proposed mechanism is thus relevant to the
ozone oxidation of thiosulfate in both droplet and bulk phases.
The data presented here and bulk data from Takizawa, et al.22 show that product distributions
vary with solution pH. Namely, in both droplet and bulk phases, highly alkaline environments
selectively form sulfate (Figure 4, right panel, and Figure 6D), while environments with pH ≤ 9
also form trithionate and tetrathionate (Figure 4, left and middle panels, and Figure 6B). This will
be important to note when treating mining wastewater with ozone microbubbles as the final
thiosalt speciation can be important for understanding environmental impacts.1, 5 For example,
wastewater will be pH-adjusted prior to release into natural waters, but if any incompletely
oxidized sulfur remains when the wastewater is released, it will then oxidize and acidify the
receiving water.
Breaking waves on large bodies of water like oceans and lakes that contain thiosalts, either
from natural or anthropogenic sources, may create atmospheric aerosols containing these same
thiosalts.16 Given the predicted acidity of atmospheric aerosols,18 this study suggests that ozone
oxidation of thiosulfate in aerosols will create a mixture of completely oxidized sulfur (i.e., sulfate)
and incompletely oxidized sulfur (i.e., trithionate and tetrathionate). The incompletely oxidized
sulfur could then be deposited back into natural waters where other oxidation mechanisms would
result in acidification of those receiving waters.1, 5, 8, 10-12 Similar analyses could also be used to
better understand the climate effects of volcanic eruptions,19 which could create thiosulfate in
stratospheric aerosols, and would have implications for SAIs designed to mimic volcanic climate
effects.
Regardless of the source of thiosulfate or other thiosalts, their metastable nature means that
they could be transported far from their origin before undergoing oxidation. This delay may cause
unexpected downstream natural water acidification, and thus ecological toxicity,1, 5, 8, 10-12 and
create unexpected sulfate aerosols, which have a significant effect on climate forcing. 29 Testing

for thiosalts in groundwaters can be challenging,2, 4, 5 and, to our knowledge, field campaigns have
not been able to directly identify thiosalts in either tropospheric or stratospheric aerosols
Difficulties in distinguishing sulfur species in complex mixtures53 suggest that thiosalts may be a
previously unidentified temporary sink for reactive sulfur in the environment, and more direct
detection studies will be required to understand the full implications of the reaction mechanism
presented here.
