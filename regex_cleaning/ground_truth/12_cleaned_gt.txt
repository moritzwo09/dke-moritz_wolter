The increasing uncontrollable anthropogenic activities, and geogenic intervention have majorly
depleted the groundwater quality globally. Dimapur district, India is one such case polluted by
the significant excess presence of iron concentration. Data reports on the assessment of
groundwater quality are unfathomable in the region. Thus, our prime objective sets up What
amount of iron concentration is present? How many of those data points possess a high
concentration? and how the prediction model works in a particular area of Dimapur town. We
then used a spatial non-parametric regression method on the experimental results to further
predict the water parameters in areas where no water samples could be collected. Finally, we
compare these contours for different water parameters and connect them with the geographic
and functional properties of various locations in the studied region.

Groundwater is the major freshwater resource for the nation's development and sustenance.
The global population of about one-third entirely depends on groundwater and accounts to 7%,
36%, and 42% of groundwater water are used for manufacturing, household, and irrigation
purposes. As such in India, around 90% of the groundwater accounts for irrigation purposes
which is much higher in proportion than the global average usage of 40%, and an estimated
value of 90 million rural households primarily dependent on irrigation supported by
groundwater supplies. According to United Nation World Water Development Report 2022
(UN WWDR 2022), India has been considered the largest groundwater user with an evaluated
groundwater withdrawal of 251 km3/year. Over the past few decades, the increasing population
(1.3 billion) in India and demands for use in domestic, irrigation, industrial, and recreational
purposes have promoted unfathomable stress on the groundwater resources. Thus, the overgrowing demand directly or indirectly leads to unsustainable, improper management, and
overexploitation of water resources depleting the groundwater quality.
Various studies confirm the increasing rapid urbanization, fast-growing industrial activities,
climate change, and agricultural practices have found to possess serious threats to groundwater
quality/ resources in many countries. However, groundwater quality can be significantly
influenced by natural events and geogenic leaching of inorganic ions bearing rocks, minerals,
and soil depending from place to place. Such uncontrolled anthropogenic activity, improper
management of waste, and natural events can severely increase the levels of organic
contaminants, toxic metal ions metals, pesticides, nanoparticles, and emerging contaminants in
groundwater in the long run. Among such contaminants, iron contamination in groundwater
has been of great concern in many countries such as China, USA, Bangladesh, Africa and
European countries. Iron constitutes the 4th most abundant element in the earth crust mostly
occurring in the combined state as oxides. Although iron is an essential element for many
metabolic processes and functions, its overload in the human body can lead to lung cancer,
breast cancer, diabetes, infertility, etc. Additionally, the presence of high iron concentration
can lead to staining of materials, clothes, corrosion of water pipelines, and metallic taste/ foul
smell (Kumar et al., 2017). Unscientific human activities and management may have directly
or indirectly added up to the levels of iron content in the natural water resources/ aquifers.
Numerous studies suggest the iron bearing rocks and minerals can prematurely sip through the
process of leaching, dissolution, residential time, anionic and cationic exchange, and
percolation, which significantly control the flow and hydrochemical quality of groundwater.

Such distribution and occurrence are highly evident depending on the rainfall, geomorphology
and geology of the area.
Nagaland lies in the Northeastern part of India sharing its common borders with Arunachal
Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, and Myanmar. At present, there are 16 districts in Nagaland, among
which Dimapur is the fastest developing in terms of industrialization, urbanization, overall
economic activities, etc. The demand for industrial commodities such as chemical fertilizers,
inorganic compounds, various household chemical products, etc. has been particularly high in
the Dimapur district over the years. Groundwater is an important resource of Dimapur area
with the majority being dependent for drinking and recreational purposes, especially in the lowlying region. As per the 2011 census, Dimapur itself accounts for 34% of the urban pollution
in the state. Such changes/increases in the demography in a small area can significantly increase
the dependency on groundwater and result in a colossal pressure on the groundwater resources.
Additionally, the rate of deforestation due to urbanization has led to a loss of 4.75 kha of
relative tree cover equivalent to a 2.0% of the global total tree covers in the region (shown in
the supplementary information, Fig. S1a - 1c) as reported in ‘India State of Forest Report
2021’(Forest Survey of India, 2021). Such loss in the tree covers can significantly lead to a
reduction in infiltration capacity and change the course of discharge, and physicochemical
properties of surface and groundwater flowing through the watershed. Further, the overexploitation caused by rampant dumping and burning of waste on the land resources can also
leave a negative impact on the water quality.
However, with the increasing urbanization and population, reports of pollution data or water
quality data in the Dimapur area either groundwater or surface water sources are hard to come
by. Such over-lying conditions can be attributed to a lack of proper infrastructure, slow
economic growth, and less scientific temperament (Kibami et al., 2013). With the available
data/ literature on groundwater quality as reported by researchers and Groundwater Pollution
Board, metal ion especially iron is the major key pollutant in the area owing to their presence
of high concentration in the groundwater exceeding the WHO threshold limits in the region
(Peseyie and Rao, 2017). It is evident that the pervasive anthropogenic activities may have
directly added up to the levels of iron content in the natural water resources/ aquifers of the
area (shown in the supplementary information, Fig. S2). Nonetheless, geogenic events can be
the primary factors resulting in the higher concentration of iron as evident by the

geomorphology and geogenic setting (soil/ rock/ mineral composition) of the area as per the
literature survey.
Hence, though few water quality data on iron concentration are available that throw a light,
most of the available data on groundwater in the region used a few sampling sites which
resulted in high variability of their estimates (Naleo et al., 2020). Thus, a detailed study with
data collected from a larger region is required to understand the level of contamination in the
groundwater aquifers. In this present study, the groundwater quality in a vast area covering the
Dimapur town where the growing problem is of concern was carried out. The key objective of
this study is to investigate the level of iron from tube wells/boring wells, hand pump tubes, and
dug wells. We focus on the other parameters like pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total
dissolved solids (TDS) which play a crucial role in determining the groundwater quality. This
study also focuses on the spatial distribution pattern of the iron concentration and the other
parameters based on the experimental data to connect the parameter values to the geographic
and economic characteristics of the corresponding locations. Furthermore, we specialized
moving average method to predict the parameters in non-collected water sample areas. The
distribution pattern and prediction model applied in our study can also be used on a larger data
point more rigorously and effectively to connects how each parameter behaves among
themselves or at different seasons. Hence. the analysis results from the study have greater
importance which can provide evidence of the groundwater problems in the region, bring forth
remedial solutions, and sustainable management to protect the public health from associated ill
effects of iron.

Materials and Methods

Dimapur district has an area of 927 km2 with an average elevation of 260 m above sea level.
The state receives an average rainfall of 1504.7 mm and with the temperature ranging from 2138 ֯C during summer. The area enjoys a subtropical humid climate with an average temperature
of around 26.8 ֯C during summer (July) and a minimum of about 7.0 ֯C in winter.
Geographically it is located within the coordinates of 25.84’N latitude to 93.47’E longitude
with a population density of 410/km2 as per the 2011 census. The entire district can be
categorized into four physiographic units viz alluvial plains, low to a moderate linear ridge,
moderate hills, and high hills. The most common type of soil found in the studied region is red

clay soil (tertiary group of rocks containing a high amount of iron oxide). The geomorphic
units of the region study are mostly covered by structural hills and an alluvial plain. Generally,
the area represents a sub-montane valley fill of quaternary sediments consisting mainly of clays
and pebbles which essentially provide infiltration and replenishment of groundwater. While
the tertiary rocks (which form the structural hills and residual hill) consist of shales and
sandstone act as runoff zones with less potential for groundwater replenishment. Hydrogeology
of the groundwater of the region occurs both in semi-consolidated and unconsolidated
formations. The semi-consolidated formation represents the structure of the hilly terrain
comprising sedimentary rocks belonging to Barail, Surma, and Tipam of the Tertiary age
comprising ferruginous compact sandstone, clay, shale, boulder beds, pebbles, and siltstone.
The rocks are usually joint and fractured where the course of runoff character and groundwater
occurrence is water is manifested in the form of springs due to the development of secondary
porosity like fractures, faults, joints, etc. While the unconsolidated formation occurs in the
intermountain valley fill and piedmont plains areas along the foothills of DimapurMedziphema areas with aquifer thickness varying from place to place. The lithology unit in the
lower-lying foothill is made up of gravels, clay, pebbles, slit, boulders, sand, and conglomerate
beds of recent alluvial deposits. In brief, hydrogeology of the region indicates that joints,
lineaments, faults, and fractures are the major controlling factors for the distribution and
occurrence of groundwater.

The water samples were collected randomly from 50 deep groundwater wells (tube well /boring
well/shallow well, dug well displayed in Fig. 1a) with a depth ranging between10-150 m during
the pre-monsoon season along with their GPS coordinates. The groundwater sample was
collected in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The
bottles were firstly cleaned with distilled water, dried and a known amount of chemical solution
was used for storage of the water sample to avoid loss of the original concentration. Water
parameters like electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, and temperature
were measured during field sampling using specialized test meters (HM Digital AP-2, HM
Digital AP-1, and HANNA HI-98127). The iron concentration was analyzed by the ironphenanthroline complexation spectrophotometric method using UV-VIS spectrophotometer
Agilent Cary 100. In short, the absorbance of the complex iron species ([Fe(phen)3]2+, ferroin)


at 510 nm in presence of excess phenanthroline was measured using 1.00 cm quartz cells. The
overall reaction steps for the complexation of Fe2+ can be summarized as:
𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛 + Fe2+ ⇌ [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)]2+
𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛 + [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)]2+ ⇌ [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)2 ]2+
𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛 + [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)2 ]2+ ⇌ [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)3 ]2+
𝐻 + + 𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛 ⇌ 𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛H +
𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛H + + [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)2 ]2+ ⇌ [Fe(𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛)3 ]2+ + H +
The final product, ferroin is dark orange/red (in color) with an absorption maximum of 510
nm. The spectral diagrams of ferroin formation are displayed in Supplementary Information
(Fig. S3). All sampling and analysis protocols were done using APHA 23rd edition, 2017
(Baird et al., 2017).

Various descriptive statistics were computed to collect the quantitative data into simple
summaries (Supplementary, Table S1). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to study the
correlation between the two measured variables to understand the closeness of the relationship
between variables. Both Pearson’s correlation and descriptive statistics were performed using
SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics 25). A spatial non-parametric moving average regression
method was employed to monitor and understand the patterns of pollution in the region for iron
concentration. A moving average method is an effective tool where the main function is to
create a series of average values of different subsets of the full data set and was performed
using the R software version 3.3.3. Briefly, the spatial distribution of the iron concentration in
the groundwater was estimated via spatial nonparametric regression. To that goal, the ranges
of latitude and longitude were divided into ten grids. At each of these hundred grid points, the
iron concentration was estimated by the average of the iron concentrations in the water sample
collected from wells within a circle of radius 0.01 centered at that grid point (Supplementary
Fig. S4). The contours were drawn based on these estimated concentrations. The spatial
distribution for other contaminants was estimated similarly.

The data along with the levels of pH, EC, TDS, and the iron concentration obtained from the
experimental analysis of the collected 50 groundwater samples are presented in Supplementary
Table S2. The descriptive statistical summary of the monitored groundwater quality parameters
is presented in Table 1a.
The pH measures the acidity and basicity of an aqueous solution and fundamentally determines
the solubility and biological availability of chemical constituents. For example, at low pH, there
is an increment of hydrogen ions which solubilize the heavy metals (present in rocks and soil
as minerals) thereby increasing the metals cations and their toxicity in groundwater or surface
water. While at pH above 7, essential plant nutrient is drastically affected leading to lesser
production of nutrients. Whereas at high pH (pH>8.5), the taste of water turns more bitter and
smelly which notably represents the build-up of magnesium and calcium carbonate in water.
Thus, a higher pH can provoke skin dryness, and gastrointestinal and eye irritation.
Additionally, pH also determines whether aquatic species can survive depending on how much
amount of phosphorus is available in the water. The more vulnerable a species to the change in
pH to the surrounding environment, the lesser chances for its survival/ production/population.
Many studies confirm the synergistic effects on aquatic species where the chances of survival
are fatal due to the presence of additional foreign components in water. As such, a fish that can
stand at pH < 4.5 may lose the chances of survival at pH 5 if the same water contains arsenic
as low as 0.1 mg/L. The pH of the deep well groundwater in the studied area was mostly acidic
out of which 40% of the collected water sample exceeds the WHO guidelines (6.5 - 8.0) for
Drinking water quality. The pH ranged from a minimum of 5.80 and a maximum of 8.20 with
a mean of 6.75 ± 0.086.
An electrical conductivity test can be used as a build to understand the typical range for the
various water body. This can be used as a criterion for monitoring and identifying significant
changes in conductivity. This can potentially be used as a viable indicator for the discharge of
contaminants entering the water bodies/aquifers. The conductivity value varies depending on
the water source which may be severely increased through agricultural and industrial runoff,
rainfall, and municipal wastewater. An important constituent for change in groundwater
conductivity ideally is attributed to the seepage of organic material/ chemical components,
anthropogenic activities, and sewage leaks. The EC of water plays a critical influence on
aquatic life before their mobility to maximum tolerance level. An important parameter such as
salts and other substances affect the water quality for irrigation, drinking, and recreational

purposes. In our present study, the EC measurement ranged from 86 to 579 µS/cm with the
mean value of 216.96 ± 15.314 with the mean value of 216.96 ± 15.314. All the collected water
more or less showed no tolerance limit on the collected water sample.
Total dissolved solids (TDS) are the amount of inorganic and organic and materials (such as
salts, metals, minerals, and ions) dissolved in a particular volume of water. TDS are essentially
a measure of any soluble substances/particles disintegrated in water or are absorbed into the
water. TDS come from various sources including natural and man-made. Natural sources of
increased TDS accounts to adsorption of mineral (such as calcium, magnesium and potassium
from rocks/ mineral composites) during the flow discharge of soil, rivers, springs, lakes, etc.
While, anthropogenic human activity can also enhance the level of total dissolved solids in
water. Such example includes chemical pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, and chlorine which
proceeds as agricultural runoff, and from water treatment plants. Increased level of dissolved
solids can generate technical effects visibly in the form of hard water leaving deposits/ films
on fixtures, hot water boilers and water pipes, corrode pipes, and leaves a metallic taste on
water. Based on the experimental results obtained from our study, the values of TDS were also
within the tolerance limit with the maximum value to be 579 ppm. This result was in
accordance with the EC value due to their direct relationship with each other.
Physiologically, iron is an important source for the body metabolism from oxygen transporter
(haemoglobin) to storage and release of oxygen (myoglobin). It is an essential for various
physiological processes such as erythropoiesis, cellular activities (oxidation/reduction of
proteins), immune function, and act as a host defence mechanism. However, the excess iron
in the body which is stored in heart, liver, and pancreas can lead to detrimental health effects
causing diabetes, heart and liver disease. The overload of iron can be attributed to a higher
amount of iron in dietary source or from contaminated water. As such, most of the health issues
due to iron are from contaminated water bodies. Iron is a naturally occurring metals in the
combined state in the form of ores/ minerals (oxides) as hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite
(Fe3O4). The minerals/ores containing iron are mined for industrial use and various other
applications. During mining, some of iron containing minerals into the natural aqueous
environment caused by anthropogenic activities. Likewise, iron in many regions (rural and
suburban area) is a common problem, where its concentration is peaked more than the tolerance
limit of 0.3 mg/L (WHO and EPA guidelines). Geogenic origin of iron contamination can add
up the factors for its higher concentration in water, while other could be attributed to the

dissolution from iron handpumps or borehole. This could be well-explained by the presence of
iron eating bacteria which can combines with the free oxygen and convert the ferrous ion (Fe2+)
into an insoluble ferric ion (Fe3+) leaving a filamentous/ sticky/ slimy gel on the metal surface.
The iron-bearing groundwater is brownish-orange in colour, causing stanning of clothes and
pipes along with vexatious smell and metallic taste. Apparently, our study investigates the
presence of iron and confirms the pretentious high amount in the groundwater system.
Evidently, the experimental analysis depicts out of the 50-water sample collected,
approximately about 80% accounts to cross the barrier of 0.3 mg/L tolerance limit. This can be
evident by the presence of iron-bearing rock/ minerals (red clay soil / sedimentary rocks) and
the presence of iron-eating bacteria (shown in the supplementary information, Fig. S2).
3.2 Statistical methods on the experimental data
The range and standard deviation give information about the spread of a given variable. The
range in the case for pH EC, TDS, and iron is 2.40, 493, 272, 1.00138 which gives some
information about the degree of maximum variability. Standard deviation measures the average
deviation of the observations from their mean. The standard deviation value for pH, EC, TDS,
and Fe were found to be 0.6118, 108.28, 60.33, and 0.2709 respectively. To objectively
compare the spread of the four variables, we compute their coefficient of variation, which is
the ratio of their standard deviations to their means. It appears that by a coefficient of variation,
EC, TDS, and Fe show more variability with values of 0.499, 0.485, and 0.496 respectively (all
close to 0.5), which is much larger than that of pH, which turns out to be 0.091.

Skewness describes the extent of asymmetry in a given distribution. The skewness value can
be positive, negative, or zero. In positive skewness, the distribution extends with a long tail
towards the right and similarly negative skewness towards the left (Čisar and Čisar, 2010).
From Table 1a, the skewness value indicates that pH, EC, TDS, and Fe all show positive
skewness with pH and Fe showing more symmetric distribution. The Excess Kurtosis gives
information about the peakedness of a probability distribution ( as compared to the bell curve)
as well as the nature of its tail (Westfall, 2014). The results obtained (Table 1a) show both pH
and Fe are of negative value (-0.821, -0.710) which explains the distribution is light tail
presenting a platykurtic distribution. However, EC and TDS show a good positive value (2.136,
1.966) indicating the distribution has heavier tails depicting a leptokurtic distribution.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to establish the significance of relationships of the
monitored water parameters in the groundwater (Table 1b). The pH shows a near-zero

correlation with EC and TDS and a very strong negative correlation with Fe. This complies
with the observation that the presence of metallic pollutants can change the pH in groundwater.
Electrical conductivity (EC) shows a strong positive nearly perfect correlation (almost equal to
1) with TDS. Both EC and TDS show poor correlation with Fe with a value of 0.166 and 0.154.
The primary focus of this article is laid on iron concentration and its correlation with other
measures of pollution. The resultant value crossing the permissible limit with a higher iron
concentration from the collected groundwater samples, a broader estimate of the spatial
distribution of iron concentration in the groundwater of the Dimapur area would be beneficial
in evaluating the degree of iron pollution. We employ the spatial moving average regression
method described above to predict concentrations of the parameters under consideration in the
areas where no data was collected.

The contour plots of the concentrations of various parameters under consideration are presented
in Fig 2. The GPS coordinates for the sample points are given in a spherical black dot. For the
iron concentration (Fig. 2a), the various predicted values ranged from a minimum of 0.23 mg/L
to a maximum of 0.81 mg/L with a majority beyond the permissible limit of 0.3 mg/L.
Likewise, the predicted values for pH (Fig. 2b) ranged from a minimum of 5.95 and a maximum
of 8.20 with a few values beyond the permissible guidelines. The area within 25.92-25.93
latitude and 93.739-93.756 longitude shows a significant change of pH from 5.95- 6.9 (Fig. 2b)
which may be due to the municipal waste dumping site lying adjacent to the Dhansiri river and
the Dhobinala drainage that flows towards the area which later joins the river at the end. This
explains the significant change in the pH in that small area. The contour plot (Fig. 2c) for TDS
shows the majority of the predicted values are well within the permissible limit with only a few
values (75, 80, 85, and 90 mg/L) beyond the WHO guidelines. The predicted values for
electrical conductivity also show a significant distribution pattern with a minimum of 120
µS/cm and a maximum of 300 µS/cm (Fig. 2d).

The contour plots are further studied to gauge the match between the spatial concentration
patterns between different variables. The contour plot between Fe and pH (Fig. 2e) shows
intersecting contours, especially in Dimapur town and along the Dhansiri river. They are mostly
parallel to each other on the higher grounds. However, the contours of Fe and TDS are mostly
non-parallel (Fig. 2f). The same is true for the contours of pH and TDS (Supplementary Fig.
S5a). Additionally, the contour plot for three parameters (Supplementary Fig. S5b & S5c) can
give us information on how the distribution differs from each other. Herein, the contour plot

between three parameters (Supplementary Fig. S5c), shows the EC and TDS follow almost the
same distribution pattern which is not the same for pH.

Conclusion
Our brief study shows evidence of high iron concentration in groundwater of Dimapur city and
its surrounding areas which in most places exceed the maximum threshold limits prescribed by
WHO. This is also evident from the observed samples as well as our statistical estimate of the
iron concentration and other parameters for the regions where no sample could be collected.
The cause of such high iron content can be attributed to geogenic, caused by weathering of
mineral-containing rocks as evident by the geomorphology setting of the region. However,
unscientific human activity and rapid deforestation in the studied region possibly have
enhanced and contributed to the level of pollution and resulted in the reduction of infiltration
capacity, and the pivotal link catering to the source of underground aquifers. This piece of
research work with the detailed statistical treatment is being done for Dimapur, Nagaland, for
the first time and the striking results show the importance of such work. It is invariably visible
from our study, that more detailed surveys, exploration, experiments, analyses, and remedial
measures are urgently required to avoid the resulting health hazards among the population
living in the studied area.
Considering the adverse effects of excess iron pollution in mind, it is, therefore, essential to
monitor the groundwater seasonally to determine the levels of contamination in this studied
area. Furthermore, the physicochemical parameters of other trace elements (such as As, Cr, Co,
Mn, etc.) need to be monitored with a major geospatial/geomapping

study to uncover the

potential link from point to non-point sources of groundwater contamination. Studies with more
resources and a larger sample size which can give more accurate insight into the levels of
contaminants need to be undertaken urgently. It is to be noted that unplanned and unscientific
development of groundwater resources, mostly driven by individual initiatives has led to the
decline and degradation of the water quality in many places. The proper management of
groundwater resources is a prerogative of the concerned government agencies and
stakeholders. However, the absence of a knowledge-driven support system and lack of
information are key barriers to sound strategies and planning for sustainable management of
groundwater resources (conservation, regulation of extraction, and protection from pollution).
Thus, with an alarming fast population, urbanization, and uncontrol human activity, necessary
efforts for implementing suitable groundwater management strategies by all the stakeholders
are urgently needed.
