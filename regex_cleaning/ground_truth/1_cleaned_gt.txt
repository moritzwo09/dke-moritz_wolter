To better understand the key kinetic mechanisms controlling heterogeneous oxidation in organic
aerosols, submicron particles composed of an alkene and a saturated carboxylic acid are exposed
to ozone in a variable-temperature flow tube reactor. Effective uptake coefficients (ùõæùëíùëìùëì are
obtained from the multiphase reaction kinetics, which are quantified by Vacuum Ultraviolet
Photoionization Aerosol Mass Spectrometry. For aerosols composed of only of alkenes, ùõæùëíùëìùëì
doubles (from 6x10-4 to 1.2x10-3 when the temperature is decreased from 293 to 263 K.
Alternatively, for an alkene particle doped with a carboxylic acid, an efficient scavenger of
stabilized Criegee Intermediates (sCI , ùõæùëíùëìùëì is observed to be weakly temperature dependent. A
kinetic model, benchmarked to literature data, explains these results as arising from the
temperature dependent competition between unimolecular pathways of sCI that promote radical
chain cycling and those bimolecular pathways that form stable chain termination products (i.e., …ëacyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides . The implication of these results for the kinetics of aerosol aging at
low temperatures is discussed.

Reactions between trace gases and aerosol particles are controlled by multiple physical and
chemical processes, as illustrated in Figure 1A. These include adsorption and desorption of the
trace gas from the particle surface, the transfer of the trace gas from the surface into the particle
bulk and the reaction rate of the trace gas with particle-phase reactants.1‚Äì3 The rates of each of
these individual steps depend on the identity of the trace gas and the chemical composition of the
particle, as well as its physical properties such as viscosity and phase state.4‚Äì7 The coupling of
these system-dependent transport and reaction processes can make predictions of chemical kinetics
in these systems difficult and computationally intensive, especially when the reaction mechanism

in the particle phase is complex.8,9 In particular, reactions involving organic molecules, such as the
ozonolysis of alkenes, can initiate a wide variety of secondary reaction steps and reaction products,
driven by short-lived reactive intermediates embedded in complex reaction networks.10‚Äì13 Thus, it
is desirable to find a way of disentangling these various processes in order to understand how these
complex kinetics dynamically evolve during the course of reaction.
While many measurements of heterogeneous kinetics in aerosols have been conducted at a
single ambient temperature, the number of variable-temperature measurements has grown in recent
years.7,14,15 These studies are often motivated by an effort to better understand aging kinetics of
organic aerosol in cold regions of the atmosphere, such as in the artic, where organic aerosols
constitute up to 40% of observed particulate mass.16,17 However, the key parameters controlling
the heterogeneous reactivity often have differing responses to temperature, as illustrated in Figure
1B. For example, while gas solubility in liquids, described by the Henry‚Äôs law constant between
gas and bulk phases, Hgb in Fig. 1, tends to increase with decreasing temperature,18‚Äì20 the primary
ozonolysis step, described by the rate constant (krxn, Fig. 1 is expected to exhibit a positive
temperature dependence due to the activation energy for the reaction.21 Additionally, unimolecular
chemical reactions of the stabilized Criegee Intermediates (hereafter referred to as sCI generated
by ozonolysis, such as isomerization to form carboxylic acids (kiso, Fig. 1B or decomposition into
an alkoxy and an OH radical (kVHP, Fig. 1B , have rates that depend strongly on both temperature
and the molecular structure of the intermediate.22‚Äì25 Although there are many experimental or
theoretical estimates for the temperature dependence of many of the rate constants in the gas-phase
listed above, there is a need for more precise kinetic measurements in the particle phase as
emphasized in recent work.8,26 In particular, the reaction rate constant for sCI and carboxylic acids
in the particle phase, denoted here by kAAHP, has been shown to be significantly slower in the

particle phase than in the gas phase.27‚Äì29 This result could be an indication of an energetic barrier
to reaction in the condensed phase, in contrast to the barrierless mechanism in the gas phase. 28,29
Temperature-dependent measurements of this rate can aid in uncovering the mechanism of this
reaction, as well as inform estimates of the branching ratio between bimolecular and unimolecular
reactions of the sCI, which is key to understanding ozonolysis kinetics in model aerosols.
To better understand these facets of heterogeneous reactions in the particle phase, this study
builds on previous work by examining the ozonolysis kinetics of organic aerosols composed of
binary mixtures of cis-9-Tricosene (Tri, C23H46 and 2-hexyldecanoic acid (HDA, C16H32O2 as a
function of temperature (253 to 293 K . This study aims to quantify the contributions of the
competing processes outlined above to the total reactivity in this heterogeneous reaction, and to
identify the relative importance of reactant transport and primary and secondary chemical reactions
to the temperature-dependent behavior of the reactive uptake of ozone. To this end, a detailed
reaction-diffusion model is developed to compare with the experimental results, first for the pure
alkene aerosol to probe the effects of temperature on the network of secondary reactions initiated
by ozonolysis, and second in the presence of varying amounts of HDA, to probe the temperaturedependent branching ratio between bimolecular and unimolecular sinks of particle-bound sCI.
Where necessary, estimates are made of thermodynamic parameters, such as the activation energy
(Ea for the reaction of sCI with a carboxylic acid (kAAHP , with the parameter choice evaluated
against experimental results. Together, experimental and modeling results reveal how the observed
kinetics are the result of competitions between unimolecular and bimolecular reaction steps, which
are in a delicate balance across the temperature range studied here. These results highlight the
crucial role that reactive intermediates can play in aerosol aging at low temperatures.

The experimental setup is modified slightly from that described in previous work and is
diagrammed in detail in Figure S1 (Supporting Information . Briefly, a jacketed quartz flow tube
reactor is used to measure the ozonolysis kinetics on aerosols composed of binary mixtures of Tri
and HDA. The temperature of the flow tube is controlled by a recirculating chiller (VWR, AD15R ,
which flows a mixture of equal parts water and ethylene glycol (Macron Fine Chemicals through
the outer jacket of the flow tube. Experiments are conducted at temperatures in 10 degree intervals
from 253 K to 293 K as measured by the chiller‚Äôs internal thermostat. The reactor temperature is
allowed to equilibrate to within ¬±1ÀöC of the nominal temperature before each experiment.
Particles are generated via homogeneous nucleation by passing 0.3 SLM room temperature
(~20ÀöC dry nitrogen through heated organic vapor in a Pyrex tube inserted into an annular furnace
(Carbolite held at 115‚Äì120 ÀöC. A narrow particle size is then selected from the resulting
polydisperse particle distribution using an Aerodynamic Aerosol Classifier (AAC, Cambustion
Instruments set to 370 nm diameter, with a sheath flow of 3 LPM. To allow the particle-laden
flow additional time to equilibrate to the temperature, the flow is passed through a length of ¬Ω in.
copper tubing submerged in the bath of the chiller prior to entering the flow tube. The particle size
distribution is measured at the exit of the flow tube before and after reaction using a Scanning
Mobility Particle Spectrometer (SMPS comprised of a condensation particle counter (CPC
3025A, TSI Inc. and a differential mobility analyzer (DMA 3071, TSI Inc. .

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectra were recorded using Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV photoionization Aerosol
Mass Spectrometer (VUV-AMS endstation at the Chemical Dynamics Beamline (9.0.2 at the
Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA. The instrument has been described in detail previously,30

and a schematic overview is available in the supporting information (Figure S2 . Spectra were
obtained at photon energies between 9.8‚Äì10.2 eV, above the photoionization threshold for both Tri
and HDA. Aerosols sampled by the AMS were flash vaporized at a temperature of 145‚Äì155 ÀöC
before photoionization, and each spectrum collected is the average of at least 10,000 detector
sweeps. The mass spectrum of the unreacted aerosol is shown in Figure 2. Photoionization of Tri
primarily produces a molecular ion at m/z = 322, as well as a series of lower-intensity peaks
corresponding to fragments produced by alkyl loss. Photoionization of HDA at the same photon
energy yields a molecular ion at m/z = 256, however the branched structure of HDA facilitates
further fragmentation at the carbon adjacent to its carboxylic acid head group. The resulting
fragments correspond to loss either of the hexyl group, yielding a 10-carbon fragment with m/z =
172, or the octyl group, resulting in an 8-carbon fragment at m/z = 144. Reaction kinetics are
monitored as a function of ozone exposure by varying the ozone concentration in the flow tube
and recording the changes in integrated intensity of the reactant and product peaks from the VUVAMS.

Kinetic Model Description
Due to the complexity of the coupled chemical reaction and transport network described in
Figure 1A, a reaction-diffusion model was developed to simulate the expected temperaturedependent heterogeneous kinetics of the ozonolysis reaction in this system. This is done using
Kinetiscope, a stochastic reaction-diffusion simulator.31
Previously, Kinetiscope has been used to model this reaction at room temperature using a single,
well-mixed compartment description.29,32 In order to properly model the temperature dependence
of the chemical transport processes, the previous framework has been adapted to a two-

compartment description with explicit surface and bulk regions connected by diffusion pathways,
similar to the framework described by Willis and Wilson.9
Following the approach of previous work modeling aqueous droplets,3,9 the adsorption,
desorption and solvation kinetics of ozone at the gas-particle interface are determined according
to a coupled-equilibrium model, with the equilibrium constants (e.g., Hgb constrained by
experimental measurements and the results of Molecular Dynamics (MD simulations, as
described in the Supporting Information. Rate constants for chemical reaction steps are assumed
to have Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, with parameters taken from experimental
measurements (or those of the analogous gas-phase reactions given in literature. In the case of the
primary ozonolysis rate (krxn , a solution-phase measurement is used to determine the magnitude
of the reaction rate constant at room temperature, while the activation energy is chosen within a
range constrained by tabulated gas phase data, as described in the Supporting Information. The
activation energy (Ea for kAAHP is a key parameter in need of constraint; in this study, several
possible values of Ea are chosen and evaluated for their agreement with the experimental data
describing the decay of HDA, as discussed in subsequent sections. The complete reaction
mechanism employed in the final simulations, including the Arrhenius parameters describing the
rate constant for each step, is given in Table S1 (Supporting Information .

Tri Decay Kinetics

The normalized decay kinetics of Tri vs. ozone exposure (i.e. [O3] x time are shown in
Figure 3. As seen from the changing scale of the ozone exposure axis, the rate of decay of Tri
generally increases with decreasing temperature (proceeding right to left along a row , and with
increasing initial XTri (proceeding from the top to the bottom panel . Lines represent the output of
kinetic simulations.

For pure Tri aerosols (panels A-E in Figure 3 , an initial region of decay is apparent at small
ozone exposures and generally in agreement with the simulated kinetics, with several exceptions.
A fraction of Tri remaining unreacted begins to be apparent below 273 K (panels A-C , and at 253
K (panel A , and a distinct shift towards slower decay kinetics can be observed at large exposures.
This change in kinetics is taken as an indication of the onset of a phase transition in the aerosols
that is induced during the course of reaction. Since the freezing point of Tri has been reported as 0.6 ÀöC (272.5 K by FTIR measurements, the onset of this apparent phase change below 263 K
does not directly correspond to the bulk freezing transition.33 However, supercooling of organic
aerosols by more than 30ÀöC below the bulk freezing points of their constituents has been observed
in other studies where particles are produced via homogeneous nucleation.34,35,7 As such, it seems
likely that the biexponential behavior observed in panel A is the onset of a phase transition, and,
by extension, that the kinetics observed at 263 K and above (panels B-E correspond to supercooled
liquid particles. Similarly, as the bulk freezing temperature of HDA is reported to be 18 ÀöC (291
K ,36 the onset of bi-exponential kinetics in panel F, where XTri=0.8, could also correspond to the
onset of freezing of supercooled aerosol particles, accounting for the discrepancy between
simulation and experiment at 253 K. Similar behavior was observed by Katrib et al. for room
temperature ozonolysis of mixed oleic and stearic acid particles, and was attributed to the complex
phase behavior of the mixture of the two lipids.35 Composition- and temperature-dependent phase
behavior, such as differing particle morphologies forming at low temperatures due to the
interaction of the aerosol components, could be responsible for the discrepancy between the trends
in kinetics for XTri=0.8 and XTri=0.3.
Effective Uptake Coefficients (Œ≥eff) vs. Temperature

In order to evaluate the kinetics of Tri decay quantitatively across experimental conditions,
the effective uptake coefficient (Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì was calculated for each experiment,

ùõæùëíùëìùëì =

4 ‚ãÖ ùê∑ùëù [ùëáùëüùëñ]0 ùëòùëúùëèùë†

6ùëêÃÖ

(1)

where Dp is the particle diameter in cm, [Tri]0 is the number density of liquid Tri in molec. cm-3.
XTri is the initial mole fraction of Tri in the aerosol, and ùëêÃÖ is the mean speed of ozone in cm s-1.
The initial region of each Tri decay curve in Figure 3 was fit by an exponential function, from


which the decay constant kobs (in cm3 molec.-1 s-1 is obtained from each experiment. The resulting
trends in Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì for each experimental condition are shown in Figure 4.
As discussed previously,29,32 Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì differs from a traditional uptake coefficient measured via
the consumption of a gas-phase reactant as it includes all reactions that consume the condensedphase reactant, including secondary radical reactions. Zeng et al. found that the ùõæùëíùëìùëì was 6x10-4
for ozonolysis of polydisperse Tri aerosols at 298 K, 32 consistent with the values at 293 K reported
here. 29 This is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the traditional uptake coefficient of O3
on Tri measured by Wells,37 and the discrepancy between these values is evidence that radical
secondary chemistry is involved in the underlying mechanism.
The trends in Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì vs. temperature and XTri, shown in Figure 4, exhibit interesting behavior:
for pure Tri aerosol (dark blue points, Figure 4 , Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì increases monotonically by roughly a factor
of 2 as temperature decreases from 293 to 263 K. As discussed in the previous section, the
experiment then shows a marked drop from 263 to 253 K not predicted by simulations, attributed
to changes in particle phase. As the initial HDA concentration is increased in Figure 4 (XTri=0.8,
light blue points; and XTri=0.3, light orange points , Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì decreases. At 293 K, the uptake falls to
5x10-4 and 2x10-4 for aerosols with XTri=0.8 and 0.3, respectively, consistent with previous
measurements of these kinetics via APCI-MS.29 The trend with XTri generally holds as temperature
decreases, however the slope of Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì with temperature is less steep at high HDA concentrations.
The trend for XTri=0.8 (XHDA=0.2 looks nearly identical to that for pure Tri aerosol, with Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì
nearly doubling from 293 to 263 K, followed by a drop at 253 K, attributed to the onset of particle
freezing. Finally, when HDA is 70% of the initial aerosol composition (XTri=0.3 , values of Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì
plateau at 3x10-4 at 273 K, exhibiting no sharp decrease at the lowest temperature.

The decay kinetics of HDA are monitored via the decay in intensity of the molecular ion
peak at m/z = 256, as shown in Figure 5. As described previously, HDA fragment ions are observed
at m/z = 172 and 144, and exhibit nearly identical kinetics to the molecular ion peak (see Figures
S8 and S9, Supporting Information . Consistent with previous observations,29 the fraction of the
initial HDA remaining at long ozone exposures reaches a non-zero limiting value that depends on
the initial composition of the aerosol: a larger fraction of the HDA is consumed when a smaller
amount of HDA is initially present in the particle. The decay of HDA is attributed to the reaction
the carboxylic acid functionality with the sCI, which can also be consumed in competing
unimolecular reactions (Fig. 1 . As such, the decay kinetics of HDA can serve as a probe of the
branching ratio between these pathways. Notably, the limiting fraction of HDA remaining does not
seem to change dramatically across temperatures, suggesting that the change to the branching ratio
over this temperature range may be small.

As discussed in more detail later, the temperature-dependent unimolecular decay reaction
rate constants of the sCI produced in this mechanism have been constrained by gas phase
measurements and theoretical estimates,22 leaving the temperature dependence of the bimolecular
rate constant, kAAHP, free to be optimized to reproduce the experimental results. This rate constant
has been found to have no activation barrier for small sCI reacting with small acids in the gas
phase,28 but previous work indicates that the particle phase reaction proceeds at a rate much slower
than the expected liquid phase diffusion limit. Kinetic modeling is used to explore the behavior of
this reaction mechanism assuming several different values for the activation energy (Ea to assess
a reasonable range of values for this parameter given the HDA decay kinetics observed in these
experiments.
Optimization of kAAHP(T)
The temperature dependence of ùëòùê¥ùê¥ùêªùëÉ is described using the Arrhenius equation,

ùëòùê¥ùê¥ùêªùëÉ = ùê¥ ‚ãÖ ùëí ùëÖùëá

(2)

where A is the pre-factor, with the same units as the rate constant (cm3 molec.-1 s-1 , and Ea is the
activation energy barrier in kJ mol-1. As seen in Figure 5, simulations were carried out assuming
four different ùê∏ùëé (0, 20, 40, and 60 kJ mol-1 . Pre-factors are calculated for each activation energy
by assuming no temperature dependence in the pre-factor and by fixing the rate constant at 293 K
to be equal to 2.1x10-19 cm3 molec.-1 s-1, which is within one standard deviation of the value from
previous measurements (1.85 ¬± 0.27 √ó 10‚Äì19 cm3 molec‚Äì1 s‚Äì1 and in accordance with the optimal
value of kAAHP previously used in previous simulations.29 Values of the pre-factor corresponding
to each choice of ùê∏ùëé are reported in Table S2, and plots of the corresponding behavior of ùëòùê¥ùê¥ùêªùëÉ

with temperature for each set of Arrhenius parameters is shown in Figure S10 (Supporting
Information .
In the top row of Figure 5, simulation results for each activation energy are overlaid on the
experimental data for the decay of HDA observed during ozonolysis of particles with XTri=0.8. At
293 K (panel E , all of the simulation lines lie atop one another by construction, but as temperature
decreases (moving to the left, toward panel A , the model predictions for the extent of the HDA
decay diverge. Smaller activation energies (0, 20 kJ mol-1 lead to more extensive HDA decay,
while the largest activation energies (40 and 60 kJ mol-1 result in small to moderate decreases in
HDA.
The temperature-dependent trend in the experimental data for XTri=0.8 is modest, with little
change in the extent of HDA decay predicted as temperature decreases, and agreement is good
between experiments and simulations with an Ea of at least 40 kJ mol-1. This value aligns with
predictions for the minimal change in HDA decay kinetics over this temperature range from the
analytical expression for HDA decay kinetics derived in previous work.29 (Figure S11, Supporting
Information The simulation results corresponding to an Ea of 40 kJ mol-1 have been bolded in
Figure 5. For the data where XTri=0.3, the model and experiments agree sufficiently between 273
and 293 K, with model predictions for nearly all activation energies lying within the experimental
error. Agreement is poorer at lower temperatures, where phase effects due to the higher freezing
point of HDA may interfere with reaction at the lowest temperatures, as discussed previously.

Unimolecular sCI Reaction Products

As seen in the difference mass spectrum shown in Figure 6, a complex landscape of
fragments of reaction products formed from Tri ozonolysis are visible. Two peaks of note are found
at m/z =114 and 184, which are identified as the decarboxylation (M-CO2 fragments of the
carboxylic acids formed by isomerization of the C9 and C14 sCI (nonanoic acid, MW 158, and
tetradecanoic acid, MW 228 ‚Äî see Figure 1A . The growth kinetics of m/z = 184 normalized to
the initial Tri intensity are displayed in Figure 7, showing that these decarboxylation fragments,
corresponding to sCI isomerization, only have apparent kinetics in case of pure Tri, where no HDA
is present. Corresponding product kinetics and model predictions for m/z = 114, corresponding to

the decarboxylation fragment of nonanoic acid, are nearly identical and are shown in Figure S5
(Supporting Information . For aerosols with XTri=0.8 or 0.3, these peaks show zero or negative
growth relative to the background. Since the small acids assigned to these peaks are formed
exclusively by isomerization of the sCI, the lack of growth kinetics for these isomerization
products in the presence of HDA suggests that the reaction between sCI and HDA outcompetes
this isomerization pathway at all temperatures. Instances of negative kinetics are likely due to
fragments produced by ionization of unreacted Tri, which are isobaric with the assigned
decarboxylation fragments, thus decreasing below their background intensities as the reaction
proceeds and Tri is consumed.
Simulation Results
The temperature-dependent rate of the sCI isomerization step, kiso, defined in the model is
taken from the theoretical structure-activity relationship (SAR of Vereecken et al.,22 for a primary
ethyl sCI in its anti-conformer (with the O-O bond facing away from the alkyl chain . The sCI
undergoes a 1,3-cyclization reaction to form a dioxirane intermediate, followed by a ring-opening
and hydrogen shift to form a carboxylic acid. The rate of this unimolecular process is on the order
of 70 s-1 at 293 K and decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude as the temperature approaches
253 K, resulting in the trend evident in the simulation results in Figure 7: a decrease in the predicted
yield of the isomerization product with decreasing temperature. Scaling the simulated predictions
down by an order of magnitude allows for reasonable agreement with the experimental data when
XTri=1, but the experimental data does not exhibit the expected trend in product yield with
temperature. A combination of factors could contribute to this discrepancy, including a syn:anti
sCI conformer ratio produced by Tri ozonolysis that favors syn conformers, in contrast to the 1:1
ratio assumed here for simplicity.38,39 Additionally, the temperature-dependent trend could be

obscured by the scavenging of the isomerization product acids by subsequent reaction with an sCI,
as discussed in the following section. However, the disappearance of these isomerization products
in the presence of HDA still provides a benchmark for the magnitude of this unimolecular sink for
the particle-phase sCI, namely that it is smaller than the sCI + HDA sink under these conditions.

Bimolecular sCI Reaction Products

In the difference spectrum for mixed Tri/HDA aerosols shown in Figure 6 (light blue
spectrum , the three most prominent peaks are all of odd-integer mass, suggesting fragmentation
from a larger molecule: m/z = 239 is observed as a product exclusively when HDA is present, and
m/z = 141 and 211 both appear more abundant in the presence of HDA. A straightforward candidate
for the identity of the m/z = 239 peak is a fragment of …ë-acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxide esters (AAHPs

formed from the reaction between either the C9 or the C14 sCI and HDA, resulting in a C25 or C30
AAHP, respectively (Figure 1A .
Assuming these AAHP products are produced via the O-H insertion mechanism,28,40 the CO bond from the carboxylic acid head group of the HDA will be retained as the ester C-O bond in
the AAHP product. Upon photoionization, these HDA-derived AAHPs can undergo fragmentation
along the C-O bond of the ester group, yielding an [HDA-OH]+ fragment at m/z = 239, as illustrated
in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information . Alternately, if photolytic cleavage proceeds along the CC bond on the opposite side of the carbonyl, the result will be an [HDA-HO2]+ fragment at m/z =
211. Since both ions involve the HDA moiety, these peaks should probe the kinetics of both HDAderived AAHPs in aggregate. As such, only the observed kinetics of m/z = 239 are shown in Figure
8.
By similar analysis, m/z = 141 can be assigned to a fragment of the AAHP formed from the
reaction of either sCI with nonanoic acid, itself the isomerization product of the C9 sCI (Figure
1A . As for HDA-derived AAHPs, fragmentation of a nonanoic acid-derived AAHP could occur
along the ester C-O bond, yielding the observed fragment with m/z = 141, or along the alkylcarbonyl C-C bond, yielding a fragment at m/z = 113 (Scheme S2, Supporting Information .
Although a small peak is observed at m/z = 113 in Figure 6, its intensity lies too close to the
detection limit to be quantified reliably. The kinetics of the m/z = 141 peak, along with
corresponding predictions of the nonanoic-derived AAHP kinetics, are shown in Figure S7
(Supporting Information .
For tetradecanoic acid-derived AAHPs, C-O cleavage yields a fragment with m/z = 211,
(Scheme S3, Supporting Information isobaric with the C-C cleavage fragment for the HDAderived AAHPs, explaining why m/z = 211 is visible in the pure Tri spectra in Figure 6. Therefore,

the kinetics of m/z = 211 in the presence of HDA, shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information ,
likely includes contributions from fragments of the tetradecanoic-derived AAHPs. C-C cleavage
of the same AAHPs should yield a fragment at m/z = 183, where a peak is visible in Figure 6 but
of too little intensity to be reliably quantified. The relatively low intensities of the C-C cleavage
fragments in both Scheme S2 and S3 are consistent with the ester C-O bond in these species likely
being more labile to dissociative photoionization.
Simulation Results
The kinetics of m/z = 239 in Figure 8 largely agree with predictions of the total HDAderived AAHP kinetics from simulations, which depend on a chosen temperature-dependent
description of kAAHP. There is no clear temperature-dependence to the growth kinetics of the AAHP
products, which provides further evidence that the branching ratio between unimolecular and
bimolecular sCI reactions does not change significantly over this temperature range, as examined
in detail in the Discussion.
It should be noted that the peak assignments made here are not definitive, and it is
conceivable that some of the peaks in Figure 6 could belong to fragments of other reaction products
not considered in the mechanism in Figure 1A, such as secondary ozonides (SOZs , which are not
observed directly in this study. However, given the symmetric structure of 5-membered SOZ rings,
it seems reasonable to expect a nearly even distribution of heavier and lighter fragments from
SOZs, which is inconsistent with the observed preference for m/z = 141 and 211 fragments over
m/z = 113 and 183. Nonetheless, sensitivity tests of SOZ formation reactions in the kinetic model
have been conducted, and the results are summarized in the Supporting Information (Figure S4 .


Discussion
Contributions of Various Reactive Sinks to Œ≥eff
As illustrated in Figure 1A, while consumption of Tri is initiated by ozonolysis, Tri can
also be consumed by three classes of radical reactions: i abstraction of a hydrogen atom by an OH
radical, ii OH radical addition to the alkene functionality, and iii abstraction of a hydrogen atom
by an alkoxy (RO radical. A representation of the individual contributions of all four reactive
sinks (ozonolysis and the three radical sinks to the simulated decay kinetics of Tri, at a fixed ozone
exposure of of 1x1015 molec. cm-3 sec-1, are displayed in the bar chart in Figure 9. Each bar
corresponds to one experimental condition (i.e., T, XTri represented in Figure 3, with temperature
indicated by grouping along the X-axis, and initial XTri indicated by hatching on the bars. The total
height of the bar is proportional to the amount of Tri consumed at the specified ozone exposure,
and is proportional to the Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì predicted by the model. The experimentally-derived Œ≥ùëíùëìùëì have been
overlaid for ease of comparison.

molec. cm-3 sec-1. Uptake coefficients from experiments are overlaid (right vertical axis for
comparison.

In the case of pure Tri (unhatched bars , it should be noted that ozonolysis only accounts
for approximately a third of the reactivity, with radical reactions accounting for the majority of Tri
consumed across all temperatures. This result is consistent with the single-compartment model
published previously by Zeng and Wilson for room-temperature (298 K ozonolysis of Tri
aerosol.32 As the initial concentration of HDA is increased at each temperature, the contribution of
these radical sinks decreases dramatically, while the contribution of the ozonolysis sink changes
very little. Since they are the most sensitive to changes in the chemical environment, the
contributions of radical reactions to the Tri decay kinetics are key to unraveling the temperature
dependent trend in ùõæùëíùëìùëì reported in this work. As shown in Figure 1A, all radical species
responsible for consuming Tri in the model are generated by the unimolecular decomposition
channel of the sCI, which creates both OH and RO radicals. Thus, to investigate how the
contributions of radical sinks for Tri change with temperature, we must investigate the
temperature-dependent kinetics of the sCI, first in pure Tri aerosols and then in the presence of
added HDA.
The sCI Population Enhances the Initiation Rate of Radical Reactions
To begin, we revisit the rate law for the sCI formulated in prior work:29
ùëë[sCI]
= ùëòO3 [Tri][O3 ]ùëè ‚àí [sCI](ùëòiso + ùëòVHP + ùëòAAHP [HDA])
ùëëùë°

(3)

By relabeling the production rate of the sCI (the first term of the R.H.S. as k1, the sum of all the
sink terms as k2, and setting the initial concentration of Tri to be [Tri]0, the following solution can
be found to Equation 3:

[ùë†ùê∂ùêº](ùë°) =

ùëò1 [ùëáùëüùëñ]0 ‚àíùëò ‚ãÖùë°
(ùëí 1 ‚àí ùëí ‚àíùëò2‚ãÖùë° )
ùëò2 ‚àí ùëò1

To determine the behavior of this expression with variable temperature, it is instructive to look at
representative terms for the rates involved in Equation 4. Focusing first on pure Tri aerosols, we
assume that [HDA] = 0 and the kAAHP term can thus be neglected. The production rate k1 is
therefore proportional to two terms: the ozonolysis reaction rate, which decreases with decreasing
temperature, and the bulk concentration of ozone in the particle (approximated by Hgb which
increases with decreasing temperature (Figure 1B . The behavior of k1 is plotted in Figure 10A
(blue curve, left vertical axis and shows a slight increase from 293 to 253 K, indicating that the
increased solubility of O3 is dominant over this temperature range. By contrast, ùëòùëâùêªùëÉ , the
unimolecular decay rate of sCI to yield OH and RO radicals, decreases rapidly over the same
temperature range (red curve, right vertical axis . With these functional forms for k1 and k2, the
result of equation 4 are plotted against the model predictions of the total sCI population from
kinetic simulations in Figure S12 (Supporting Information .
Since all radical chemistry in the model is initated by unimolecular decay of the sCI, the
expected radical contribution to the Tri decay should be proportional to this rate of radical
initiation. We may estimate this rate as,
ùëòùëâùêªùëÉ (ùëá) ‚ãÖ [ùë†ùê∂ùêº]ùë°ùëúùë° (ùëá, ùëãùëáùëüùëñ )

The behavior of Equation 6 as a function of temperature is plotted in Figure 10B (dashed black
curve . Since both k1 has a negative temperature dependence and k2 in pure Tri particles has a

positive temperature dependence, the total sCI formation rate is predicted to increase dramatically
at low temperatures. However, due to the rapid fall-off of kVHP(T with decreasing temperature,
the effective radical initiation rate described in Equation 5 has only a modest negative temperature
dependence (green curve, Figure 10B .
Together, these opposing trends‚Äîthe increasing sCI concentration and decreasing
unimolecular decay rate at low temperatures‚Äîexplain the trend in radical reactivity in Figure 9:
although the Tri consumed by ozonolysis remains nearly constant across temperatures, the
increased sCI population initiated by ozonolysis drives modest increases in radical chemistry. At
low temperatures, these increases contribute significantly to the Tri decay kinetics. This finding
highlights the importance of considering secondary reactions when modeling aerosol oxidation at
low temperatures. However, it should be noted that this analysis does not include the impact of
bimolecular sinks, i.e., the reaction with carboxylic acids, in the sCI sink term k2. Therefore, fully
understanding the temperature dependent behavior of the sCI population requires a treatment of
the sCI branching ratio between bimolecular and unimolecular reactions.

The sCI Branching Ratio (k‚Äô) Balances Unimolecular and Bimolecular Pathways
As seen in Figure 9, when the initial HDA concentration in the particles increases, the
reactive contributions of radical reactions decrease significantly. As a result, at high initial HDA
concentrations, ozonolysis accounts for a much larger fraction of the Tri consumed during the
reaction: for simulations with XTri=0.3 (cross-hatched bars , ozonolysis accounts for roughly twothirds of the Tri consumption across all temperatures. The decrease in overall Tri consumption

with the addition of HDA is therefore primarily due to the loss of radical reaction sinks via the
reaction between sCI and HDA.
The kinetics of this reaction can be extrapolated from the decay kinetics of the HDA. In
previous work at room temperature, the rate of HDA decay was shown to depend on the ratio of
rate constants k‚Äô,29 defined as
ùëò‚Ä≤ =

ùëòùê¥ùê¥ùêªùëÉ
ùëòùëñùë†ùëú + ùëòùëâùêªùëÉ

Since other bimolecular sinks were neglected, k‚Äô also corresponds to the branching ratio between
the bimolecular (numerator of Equation 7 and unimolecular (denominator sinks of the particlephase sCI. Fitting to experimental data in that work yielded a k‚Äô of 6.59 ¬± 0.95 √ó 10‚àí22 cm3 molec‚àí1
at 293 K, very similar to a value extracted from a modeling study of the ozonolysis of oleic acid
particles.41 Assuming gas-phase literature values for ùëòùëñùë†ùëú + ùëòùëâùêªùëÉ at the same temperature, this
corresponds to a kAAHP of 1.85 ¬± 0.27 √ó 10‚àí19 cm3 molec‚àí1 s‚àí1, which was successfully used to
model the reaction kinetics. However, to extend this analysis to temperatures lower than 293 K,
temperature-dependent descriptions of the rates in Equation 7 must be adopted. Since
experimentally-benchmarked theoretical estimates are available for the temperature-dependence
of the two unimolecular rates,22 the description of ùëòùê¥ùê¥ùêªùëÉ (ùëá) in the particle phase will also
determine the temperature dependence of k‚Äô for the purposes of this study. Four descriptions of
kAAHP(T are chosen corresponding to the four values of the activation energy (Ea discussed in the
Results and detailed in Table S2 and Figure S10 (Supporting Information .


Figure 11A shows the computed k‚Äô(T for each choice of Ea for kAAHP(T , as described in
the Results. Note that the values of kAAHP(T , and therefore k‚Äô(T , all converge at 293 K by
construction in order to agree with room temperature measurements. When Ea=0, kAAHP is constant
across all temperatures, while the unimolecular decay rates falls off at low temperatures. This
makes the bimolecular channel increasingly favorable at low temperatures, and thus increasing k‚Äô.
As Ea is increased, the slope of k‚Äô with temperature gradually becomes more positive, reaching a
nearly flat slope when Ea=40 kJ mol-1 (solid line , indicating that the changes in the unimolecular
rates and kAAHP under this condition are approximately equal over this temperature range. Thus,
an unchanged branching ratio k‚Äô with temperature would imply an activation energy of kAAHP on
the order of 40 kJ mol-1.
As before for neat Tri aerosols, we may estimate the temperature-dependent population of
the sCI produced during the reaction by including the description of kAAHP(T in the loss term (k2
in Equation 6. The simulation results and predictions for the sCI population (both assuming an Ea
of 40 kJ mol-1 when HDA is present in the aerosol are shown in Figure S12 (Panels B and C,
Supporting Information . While lower temperatures still lead to enhanced buildup of sCI during
the reaction, the presence of HDA reduces the overall sCI population across the modeled
temperature range. Computing the effective radical initiation rate for an initial XTri=0.8 results in
the curves plotted in Figure 11B, where the relationship between Ea and the slope of the curves is

opposite the trend in k‚Äô(T : as Ea is increased, the reaction with HDA is diminished at low
temperatures, causing the sCI to favor unimolecular reactions. Conversely, a smaller Ea results in
a diminishing radical initiation rate with decreasing temperature, as reaction with HDA begins to
dominate the unimolecular decay rate. It should also be noted that, as expected, the effect of the
sCI + acid reaction scales with the initial HDA concentration in the aerosol, leading to the dramatic
decrease in the radical initiation rate when XHDA is increased to 0.7 (XTri=0.3, solid red line .
Thus, the temperature-dependent branching ratio k‚Äô(T , and by extension the activation
energy of the primary bimolecular sink, controls a significant portion of the reactivity in mixed
Tri/HDA aerosols. This effect is evident in the simulated Tri decay kinetics, as shown in Figure
11C. The choice of Ea, and thus the temperature dependence of k‚Äô(T , modulates the slope of the
uptake coefficient with temperature: smaller values of Ea lead to smaller changes in ùõæùëíùëìùëì with
temperature, according to the trend in the radical initiation rate seen in Figure 11B. Comparison
between the experimental and simulated ùõæùëíùëìùëì additionally provides evidence of an activation
barrier to the reaction between sCI and HDA on the order of 40‚Äì60 kJ mol-1, in agreement with
modeling of the HDA decay kinetics in Figure 5. However, it should be noted that simulations with
no activation barrier still have a slight negative temperature dependence, due to increases in ozone
solubility.
Therefore, consistent with the results presented in Figure 9, the net effect of adding HDA
to the aerosol mixture is to decrease the effective rate of radical reaction initiation at all
temperatures. However, the magnitude of the increase in ùõæùëíùëìùëì requires that the branching ratio
k‚Äô(T be sufficiently constant across the temperature range studied here to allow unimolecular
reactions to remain competitive. Such a ‚Äúflat‚Äù temperature-dependence of the branching ratio
requires a significant activation energy barrier on kAAHP in the particle phase. This result is again

in contrast with gas-phase measurements of the sCI + carboxylic acid reaction, which have been
shown to be barrierless and enhanced by long-range interactions between the reactants.27,28,40 In
particular, Vereecken notes that reactant orientation is crucial in this reaction, as the insertion
reaction mechanism implicated in AAHP formation requires the sCI and the acid functional group
to adopt a co-planar geometry, likely making this reaction subject to substantial steric effects in
the particle phase, which could create an activation barrier. Thus, while the presence of particlephase acids as bimolecular reaction partners does lead to sCI scavenging at low temperatures,
relatively high concentrations of acids (i.e., in excess of the alkene still appear to be required to
shut off the effects of sCI-initiated radical chain cycling.

Conclusion
Together, the experimental data and modeling results presented here highlight how the
kinetics of heterogeneous ozonolysis reactions on aerosol particles are strongly determined by the
reactivity of particle-phase intermediates, especially unimolecular reactions of the sCI, even at low
temperatures. While decreases in temperature lead to decreases in the radical-initiating
unimolecular decay rates of sCI, low temperatures also increase the solubility of ozone, leading to
increased buildup of reactive intermediate concentrations over the temperature range studied here.
Thus, decreases in temperature can have the net effect of enhancing reactivity by indirectly driving
increases in secondary chemistry. Additionally, in the presence of a sCI scavenger, such as the
saturated acid used here, the activation energy required for the sCI + carboxylic acid reaction in
the particle phase leads to decreases in the rate that closely match the decreases in unimolecular
rates, maintaining a nearly constant branching ratio between these reactions over the temperature
range studied here. This finding would again suggest that, up to a factor of the concentration of


scavenger molecules in the particle phase, unimolecular reactions of particle-phase sCI can remain
competitive at low temperatures and continue to drive radical chain chemistry.
These results could have implications for other model systems for heterogeneous reactivity,
such as oleic acid, where the importance of secondary chemistry to the overall reactivity has been
explored.8,41 In particular, an unchanging temperature-dependent branching ratio between
bimolecular and unimolecular reactions could explain why the temperature dependence of the
uptake of ozone by supercooled oleic acid aerosols appears to be flat.7 Due to the high
concentration of acid functional groups in oleic acid, bimolecular reactions could modulate both
the concentration of particle-phase sCI as well as the radical initiation rate, keeping chainpropagating and chain-terminating reactions in equilibrium before the onset of particle freezing.
Future studies could be conducted to explore how well this effect generalizes to similar reaction
systems, and to determine the temperature range and conditions over which it is relevant before
particle phase effects become dominant.
Finally, avenues for future experimental work include more explicit treatment of particle
phase and morphology, both of which affect reactant transport. Experiments with different particlephase reactants, varied relative humidity, or which include nucleation seeds to induce particle
freezing42 could help to disentangle the effects of particle morphology from the temperaturedependent chemistry explored here. In addition, the role of the surface in facilitating the reaction
with respect to changes in temperature and particle composition is a key question, which could be
addressed by size-dependent measurements at low temperatures, which report the scaling of the
reactivity with particle surface area, or by surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques, such as Xray photoelectron spectroscopy, which could report on the evolving composition of the particle
surface during reaction.
