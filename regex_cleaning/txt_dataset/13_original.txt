Introduction
In addition to being referred to as alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides, ammonium alkyl
dimethyl (phenylmethyl) chlorides, and alkyl dimethyl (phenylmethyl) quaternary ammonium
chlorides, benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are also referred to as quaternary ammonium
compounds (QACs), whose structure is illustrated in Figure 1. Due to their greater biocidal
activity, C12 and C14 derivatives are usually sold in mixtures of compounds with chains from C8
to C18. This mixture is usually sold commercially [1]. Gerhard Domagk originally revealed BAC

in 1935. The first product in the United States to include BAC was registered with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1947 [2].

Figure 1. The chemical structure of benzalkonium chloride, where n =8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18.

Because of their stability, high antibacterial activities in acid formulation, and long shelf life, the
quaternary surfactants benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and benzathine chloride are selected by a
significant number of producers. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) can range from being colorless to
having a very light-yellow hue, depending on its purity (impure). There is a high degree of
solubility of benzalkonium chloride in both ethanol and acetone. Although dissolving in water for
most of substances is a sluggish process, but BAC is highly soluble in water. In general, aqueous
solutions are chosen because they are simpler to work with. It is recommended that aqueous
solutions have a neutral to slightly alkaline pH [3]. In addition to being cationic surfactants, BAC
is also frequently utilized as a disinfectant and germicide due to the powerful protein-denaturing
effect that they possess. A solution of 10% BAC combination is typically utilized, particularly in
hospitals; this solution is then diluted to a solution that is between 0.05 and 0.1 % with the intention
of being used for a variety of disinfection procedures [4, 5].
Although BAC is most employed as a preservative in eye drops, it is also utilized as an antiseptic
and disinfection when it is present in higher quantities. Two amounts of BAC, 0.1% and 0.4%,
were tested that utilized for this purpose [1].
In veterinary medicine, an injectable glucocorticoid formulation that is intended for use in cattle,
pigs, horses, sheep, goats, and pigs contains BAC as an excipient is utilized. The concentration in
this formulation is less than 0.05%, which results in a dose that is approximately between 0.006
and 0.009 mg/kg body weight [6].
As soon as it is used for the first time in drugs, there is a possibility that BAC might cause allergic
responses such as a rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, chemical burn, or skin
irritation such as redness, burning, or stinging that does not go away, as well as a mild tingling

feeling [7, 8]. These allergic symptoms might also appear in post oral ingestion alterations in
tongue, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and stomach that may have been exposed to BAC. BACexposed digestive tract and surrounding regions revealed erosion but no inflammatory cell
infiltration. Acute kidney tubular necrosis and liver central lobular necrosis were compatible with
acute circulatory failure [9, 10].
The aim of the research is to find answers to questions like, Is the proof of the toxicity of BAC
substances in medicine sufficient? Have earlier studies confirmed that or have they failed to do
so? What are the most harmful exposures to this chemical when taking it medicinally, and what
are the effects, if any, that were observed on humans? Evidence supports the impact of the
medicine on the environment after consumption, particularly in used waters [11].

Benzalkonium Chloride Synthesis and Manufacturing Process
Benzalkonium salts are an economically important group of industrial chemicals that are used in
a wide range of products and situations, from manufacturing to everyday life [11]. Benzalkonium
chloride (BAC) syntheses require alkyl dimethyl amines, which are tertiary amines with two
methyl groups and a third alkyl group, C8–C18 [12] and benzyl chloride, a white liquid with a
pungent odor, induces eye tears [13]. Benzyl chloride primarily changes molecules' chemical
characteristics by adding benzyl functionality. This is used to make plasticizers, sanitizers, oil
extraction products, and medicines [14]. The known method for producing benzalkonium chloride
(BAC) by interaction of tertiary amines with benzyl chloride is illustrated in Figure 2. Where R
stands for the aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals that (alkyl radicals). A tertiary amine mixture is made
up of amines with alkyl radicals. There are a lot of tertiary amines in the mixture that have alkyl
radicals with more than 14 carbon atoms, which made the final product, alkyl dimethyl benzyl
ammonium chlorides, benzalkonium chloride BAC, are toxic [15].

Figure 2. Preparation reaction of benzalkonium chloride.

Different rates of benzyl chloride's chemical reactions with tertiary amines and possible side results
from substance interactions. This produces many impurities and undesirable alterations in the final
product's valuable functioning properties. Refined tertiary amine dimethylcetylamine can be
mixed with 0.5 mol of benzyl chloride at 78° C for 2–2.5 hours to make BAC with a final
conversion rate of 92% [15].
BAC manufacturing comprises various industrial processes: The raw materials include alkyl
dimethyl amine and benzyl chloride charging, along with a method for specification examination.
The reaction stage involves the formation of benzalkonium chloride, the reaction requires applying
heat to the reactor chamber. Testing: the process of testing the product to ensure its quality.
Filtration step to remove any impurities. Packing is the final step in packaging the product for
distribution.
The process uses toxic raw materials that could be harmful to people and the environment during
the processing steps [16, 17]. Therefore, quality assurance is conducted through a testing phase to
ensure the product meets specified standards [18]. This is followed by a filtration step designed to
remove impurities, which can result in waste products that must be handled to prevent
environmental contamination. The final step is the packaging of the BAC for distribution, during
which care must be taken to avoid any spillage or leakage that could harm the environment.
Considering environmental concerns is always essential when meeting the requirements for ecofriendly industrial processes [19].
Another method for preparation of BAC solution involves mixing di alkyl methylamine and benzyl
chloride in alkylene glycol at 95–100°C and reaction time of 5 hours. The process takes too long
and produces a quaternary ammonium compound solution that is not very strong [15].

Benzalkonium Chloride Uses in Drugs
Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) disinfects and preserves, it is in most multi-dose aqueous nasal,
eye, and ear products. Preservative for eye drops, at 0.01-0.02%, it has been the most common eye
drop preservative since the 1950s, its multidose container-effective bactericide and fungicide and
reduces organism growth. Many drugs contain preservatives, ophthalmology's main preservative
is BAC [20]. More than 200 EU-approved nasal and 10 inhaled medications contain BAC as a
preservative. Some BAC medicines can be used on the skin, oral cavity, oral mucosa, rectal,
vaginal, and parenteral routes [21].
Even though ocular medicines containing BAC might cause allergies and dry eye symptoms, BAC
is used in approximately 70% of ophthalmic formulations in concentrations that vary between
0.005 and 0.2%. Even though ocular medicines containing BAC might cause allergies and dry eye
symptoms, BAC is used in approximately 70% of ophthalmic formulations in concentrations that
vary between 0.02 - 0.04% [22]. Side effects of this medication include eye pain, change in vision
and clarity, redness, and eye irritation, hence it should be used with caution under the supervision
of a doctor especially with cases of pregnancy and breastfeeding period [23]. BAC is effective
against common ear pathogens like at concentrations between 0.004% and 0.01% [24]. However,
high concentrations of BAC can build up in the lipid layers of the tear film and external auditory
canal, which can damage them and make it harder for them to heal over time [25].
Refined BAC nasal drops relieve stuffy noses (blocked noses). The concentration of BAC in nasal
sprays, drops, and ointments is usually ranges from 0.005% to 0.2%, other concentration might be
used [26]. Moisturizes and loosens nasal mucus to relieve congestion quickly. Sodium chloride
and benzalkonium chloride nasal drops moisturize the nose [27]. This helps treat a stuffy nose
from a cold or allergies [22]. Using nasal decongestants for allergic rhinitis for a long time can
cause "rebound swelling" and more congestion [28]. The preservative BAC in most decongestant
sprays can worsen allergic rhinitis and cause toxic reactions in the nose, eyes, ears, and lungs [29].
Recently published studies show BAC nasal sprays' effects. A measure of nasal swelling and
reactivity with histamine tests found that BAC induces swelling and hyperreactivity [30]. BAC
0.15% antiseptic gel is a semisolid dermatology product. Precise skin application targets the
treatment area with this design. Patients allergic to any of its ingredients should not use this

antiseptic gel on open wounds, broken skin, eyes, ears, and mucous membranes due to potential
harm [31].
The tear film and auditory canal could get damaged from BAC buildup in lipid layers. Using
medications containing BAC with caution and medical supervision is essential due to the potential
for toxic reactions and rebound swelling. This is particularly important during pregnancy and
breastfeeding. Making educated and conscientious medication decisions requires knowledge of
these risks.

Mechanism of Benzalkonium Chloride Toxicity
Toxic effects in humans caused by BAC and other quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are
mainly associated with their chemical structure and mechanism of action. Benzalkonium chlorides
interact with negatively charged components of bacterial cell membranes, such as phospholipids
and lipopolysaccharides, because their nitrogen atoms are positively charged [32]. This interaction
is the mechanism of action. Cell death occurs when this interaction compromises the integrity of
the cell membrane, which allows cellular contents to seep out [33].
The method of BAC action is good for disinfection, but it is harmful to humans because BAC
damage bacterial cell membranes, which can induce toxicity in human cells at high doses or
prolonged exposure [34]. Absorption of BAC through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract can
cause systemic toxicity, affecting many organs and systems, this can harm the liver [35]. BAC
vary in toxicity according on chemical, concentration, and exposure time. Avoiding health risks
requires proper BAC handling, use, and disposal according to safety standards as mentioned
before. BACs' capacity to interact with cellular components and break cell membranes is the
primary mechanism by which they might cause hazardous consequences in humans. Toxic action
mechanisms are described in further depth here. Because of their positively charged nitrogen atom,
BAC can interact with phospholipids and proteins, which are negatively charged components of
cell membranes [36]. As a result of this interaction, the following outcomes are possible: enhanced
permeability of cell membranes; hence, bacteria can clench lipid bilayers, allowing enzymes,
proteins, and electrolytes to flow out of cells, causing complete disintegration and cell lysis
(rupture) [37]. Solubilizing lipids in the cell membrane, which results from BAC at greater
concentrations, leads to essential cellular functions disruption when BAC bind to and block the
activity of enzymes that are linked to the cell membrane [38].

BAC can also be harmful by denaturing proteins and inhibiting enzymes [39]. BAC alter protein
tertiary and quaternary structures, denature enzymes, and interact with them. It can hinder critical
enzymatic processes and disrupt cellular functions [40]. BAC poisoning may cause oxidative stress
and mitochondrial malfunction [41]. BAC may deplete cellular antioxidant defenses, causing
oxidative stress. Lipids, proteins, and DNA can be damaged by oxidative stress [42]. Energy
production and cellular respiration are also hampered by BAC, which alter mitochondrial function.
Genotoxicity and mutagenicity are other types of BAC toxicity that can cause DNA damage,
chromosomal abnormalities, and mutations [43]. Cancer and other genetic problems may result
from these impacts. Immunotoxicity, where BAC break cell membranes and impair immune cells
like macrophages and lymphocytes from recognizing and responding to infections [44].
Neurotoxicity, BAC can cross the blood-brain barrier and disrupt neuronal cell membranes, change
neurotransmitter release, and cause central nervous system oxidative stress [45].
The exact chemical, concentration, exposure method, and duration are some of the variables that
determine the degree to which BACs are hazardous to the human body. Minimizing the danger of
harmful health consequences requires following suitable safety rules and regulations when
handling and utilizing BAC.

Characteristics of Potential Risks of Benzalkonium Chloride on Human Health and
Environment
Benzalkonium Chloride (BAC) poisoning is the result of significant exposure to high
concentrations of BAC. The poisoning can result from ingesting, inhalation, or cutaneous contact.
The toxicity threshold of blood concentration of BAC might fluctuate based on the length of
exposure and method of ingestion. The recognized fatal dose for humans ranges from 50 to 500
mg/kg, depending on the concentration of BAC in the product and the mode of exposure [46, 47].
BAC poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and discomfort in
the stomach. coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath are all symptoms of respiratory
problems. Lung damage, chronic respiratory problems, and even respiratory collapse are all
potential outcomes of prolonged exposure to the substance. Blister formation, skin irritation, and
redness are other symptoms might be generated [48, 49]. Sensitization of the skin and allergic
reactions are possible outcomes of prolonged or repeated exposure to the substance. If the chemical
is allowed to come into contact with the eyes, it may cause inflammation, redness, and irritation in
7

the eyes [50]. Itchiness, hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing are some of the symptoms that
are associated with allergic reactions [7]. As a result of extreme circumstances, seizures, tremors,
and loss of consciousness are all possible outcomes [51].
BAC also impacts the digestive system. Studies have shown that exposure to small amounts of
these antimicrobial substances, particularly BAC, can lead to an increase in colitis. Furthermore,
exposure to BAC was discovered to enhance Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in the systemic
circulation by affecting intestinal barrier function, leading to increased amounts of bacterial
products in the bloodstream. These findings indicate that commonly used antimicrobial agents may
exacerbate the progression of inflammatory bowel disease and its related colon cancer [52].
Therefore, it is important to note that BAC poisoning is highly hazardous and can occur due to
significant exposure levels through ingesting, inhalation, or skin contact. Fatal dosages vary from
50 to 500 mg/kg, depending on the level of exposure. Symptoms may manifest as gastrointestinal
disturbances, respiratory troubles, dermatitis, and ocular inflammation, with severe instances
resulting in seizures and loss of consciousness. BAC exacerbates colitis and may promote colon
cancer by impacting the digestive system. BAC presents immediate and long-term health hazards,
requiring carefulness and preventive actions.
Pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, especially those dealing with very hazardous compounds,
present substantial environmental hazards [53]. The hazards arise from different phases of
production, such as raw material handling, synthesis, purification, and waste disposal.
Unintentional spills or leaks of harmful substances can pollute land, water bodies, and the
atmosphere, causing significant ecological harm [54]. Insufficient treatment of wastewater with
dangerous compounds can lead to prolonged contamination [55], impacting marine life and posing
a risk to human health by accumulating in the food chain. Moreover, the release of toxic particulate
matter in manufacturing operations adds to air pollution, worsening respiratory problems and
climate change. Stringent rules and sustainable procedures are necessary to reduce the negative
environmental effects of pharmaceutical manufacturing activities [56].
Pharmaceutical manufacturing and usage of BAC pose environmental risks. Mishandling or spills
of BAC during manufacture can pollute soil and streams, harming local ecosystems [57]. In
addition, inappropriate disposal of production facility waste containing BAC can cause long-term
contamination that harms wildlife and humans [58]. After human use and excretion, BAC might
enter wastewater systems. Insufficient wastewater treatment may discharge these substances into

natural waterways. Disrupting aquatic habitats can harm fish and other organisms [59]. BAC in
wastewater can also generate more hazardous metabolites, endangering the environment [60].
Therefore, stringent regulation and adequate wastewater treatment are needed to reduce the
environmental risks of BAC in pharmaceutical manufacturing and use. The risk may proceed when
the BAC traces reach drinking water sources, making the purification process more complicated
for drinking water treatment plants [61, 62].
Wastewater containing BAC can have significant impacts on the environment due to several
factors. First, BAC is known to be persistent in aquatic environments, meaning they do not easily
break down and can accumulate over time [63]. This persistence can lead to long-term exposure
of aquatic organisms to these compounds, potentially affecting their health and reproductive
capabilities. Additionally, BAC has been shown to have toxic effects on various aquatic organisms,
including fish, algae, and invertebrates. Exposure to BAC can disrupt hormone regulation, impair
immune function, and even lead to mortality in sensitive species[64].
Moreover, BAC can undergo transformation in the environment, forming potentially more toxic
byproducts. For example, in the presence of sunlight and other organic matter, BAC can react to
produce disinfection byproducts (DBPs) such as chlorinated compounds, which are known to be
harmful to aquatic life and can also pose risks to human health when present in drinking water
sources [65].
BAC in wastewater can also cause bacteria to become antibiotic-resistant. Antimicrobial drugs
like BAC are released into wastewater, which can select antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can make treating human and animal diseases difficult, which can
affect public health [66].
BAC-containing wastewater can disrupt aquatic habitats by poisoning organisms, forming
hazardous byproducts, and promoting antibiotic resistance. Thus, adequate wastewater treatment
is necessary to reduce the environmental consequences of BAC in pharmaceutical effluent.

Initiatives to Reduce Toxicological Harm by Making Use of Non-Conventional Substances
Concerns about the safety and environmental impact of common substances, such as BAC, used
in the pharmaceutical business are growing. As a result, there is a shift in focus toward researching
non-conventional substances and strategies. Companies are making this change because they want
9

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zfj3p-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0857-0097 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

to lessen the bad effects of standard pharmaceutical compounds like heavy metals and synthetic
chemicals. Right now, the most important goal of pharmaceutical research and development is to
find ways to reduce toxicological harm by using rare chemicals. By using natural compounds,
biodegradable materials, and new formulations, these projects want to make pharmaceutical
products safer and help make drug production more environmentally friendly. This initiative looks
at the growing trend of using non-traditional substances in the pharmaceutical business as a
proactive way to deal with toxicological issues.
Quaternary ammonium compounds like benzalkonium chloride, 2-poly(ethyl alcohol), chlorobutanol, and parabens are typical preservatives that meet most of the antimicrobial required
criteria. As stated Gupta, Mishra [67] in their study that preservatives in ocular formulations harm
the epithelium, yet they are important in multi-dose containers. Since BAC causes ocular
cytotoxicity, Polyquaternium-1, sodium perborate, and stabilized oxy chloro-complex are being
investigated. For individuals with severe allergies or surgical circumstances, a preservative-free
single-dose bottle was employed. Preservative-free containers must be sanitized and stored
properly to prevent microbial growth.
Regarding some case studies in this context, in their 2017 study, Lee et al. [68] noted that
concerned companies began reducing stabilizers while maintaining the medications from breaking
down as soon as it was established that BAC was hazardous for patients' eyes since it can damage
the lens and make the eyes dry. It has been thought of as BAC alternatives and produced nonpreservative packs. An example of a hormone-like chemical is prostaglandin, which might alter
the color of the lens and the skin around the eye. Despite these negative effects, it affects
inflammation and pain in several ways. Researchers administered BAC-containing and nonpreservative disposable packs of the drug (Tafluprost) to study participants and examined the
impact of the 0.0015% dose on both products. To lessen the likelihood of unwanted side effects,
many ophthalmologists are interested in prescribing prostaglandin analogs, which are both
efficacious and non-preservative.
Referring to other case studies on this matter. Calvo-Flores and Mingorance-Sánchez [69]
conducted research in 2021 on deep eutectic solvents (DES), which has inherent antibacterial
properties that can eliminate microorganisms. Utilizing DES as biocides in various material
compositions containing capric and lauric acids can eradicate certain gram-positive bacteria. Due
to these characteristics, DES appears to be a promising option for managing and averting
10

infections. Another option proposed is the creation of an antibacterial deep eutectic by combining
BAC with acrylic acid (AA). This compound can be incorporated into dental resin composites to
provide long-lasting antibacterial materials that are biocompatible.
Ali and Lehmussaari [70] demonstrated that particulate polymeric delivery systems, such as
microspheres and nanoparticles, can effectively transport pharmaceuticals while avoiding harmful
effects. These systems differ in size. A microsphere is a particle larger than 1 μm, while a
nanoparticle is a particle smaller than 1 μm. This separation is advantageous due to their distinct
molecular and physical properties. No sterile eye products based on these technologies are
currently available, but they show great potential in the field of ophthalmology, particularly for
delivering medications to the retinal space at the back of the eye.

Future Prospective Based on the Current Study
Many ideas can emerge with respect to the potential outcomes of this study in the future.
Examining novel molecules and methods to lessen the negative effects on human health and the
environment caused by commonly used pharmaceuticals, such as BAC. Investigating novel
formulations, biodegradable polymers, and natural substances with the goal of creating safer and
more eco-friendly pharmaceuticals. The toxicological consequences of BAC, including its effects
on human cells and organs, as well as the variables that affect its toxicity, such chemical
composition, concentration, and exposure period, will require additional research. Research on the
use of deep eutectic solvents (DES) in place of BAC, using these solvents for the elimination of
microbes, and their intrinsic antibacterial characteristics. The ongoing investigation focuses on the
potential dangers of BAC in various pharmacological forms, particularly those intended for the
skin, eyes, and nose. Analyzing the possibility of BAC systemic toxicity through skin, lung, or
gastrointestinal tract absorption.

Conclusions
There are major safety concerns regarding the possible toxicity of benzalkonium chloride (BAC),
even though it is widely used as a preservative in medicinal materials. Variables such as the period
of exposure, the mode of ingestion, and the concentration of the product all play a role in
determining the threshold for toxicity. BAC poisoning poses a variety of risks, depending on these
11

variables along BAC journey from manufacturing to disposal in wastewater routes. These risks
can be incurred through ingestion, inhalation, or cutaneous contact. To mitigate potential health
risks, it is crucial to strictly adhere to strict safety standards when handling and applying BAC.
However, to address the environmental and safety concerns associated with the use of BAC, there
is an urgent need for extensive research into alternative chemicals and procedures. The
investigation of natural substances, biodegradable materials, and new formulations is a promising
route that can be pursued in order to improve the safety of pharmaceuticals and preserve the
environment. Moreover, the disposal of BAC in wastewater presents an additional environmental
risk, necessitating careful consideration and mitigation strategies to prevent adverse impacts on
aquatic ecosystems and human health.
