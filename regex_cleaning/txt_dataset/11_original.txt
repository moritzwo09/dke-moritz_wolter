Abstract
Chemicals serve pivotal functions in many commercial and consumer products. To manage chemicals
and their impact on the environment, chemical risk assessment (CRA) and material flow analysis (MFA)
are employed. However, challenges arise in accessing data, particularly in the end-of-life (EoL) stage of
products. This perspective manuscript explores how software and data systems can facilitate CRA and MFA
at the EoL stage. This contribution reviews regulatory data sources like the Pollutant Release and Transfer
Registers, information extraction from academic data via natural language processing, and real-time data
to improve understanding of the EoL supply and management chain. Additionally, the manuscript
discusses the application of graph neural networks and transfer learning techniques to improve the
representation and performance of EoL supply chain models.

1. Introduction
Chemicals are essential components of commercial products like batteries and industrial lubricants.
However, certain uses of hazardous chemicals can pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the
environment through their entire life cycle. Chemical risk assessment (CRA) is a method used to make wellinformed decisions, choose compounds with safer characteristics, and develop and implement strategies
to eliminate or decrease chemical risks[1].
Material flow analysis (MFA) quantifies and allocates material movement (e.g., chemicals) in
production systems, releases, and ecosystems[2]. In CRA, MFA helps assess chemical risk and exposure. It
assists in determining the receptors (e.g., workers) that may be exposed to a chemical in the work
environment and the quantity of releases into the environment. MFA also identifies scenarios that may
result in human and environmental exposure[3].
The data acquisition for MFA and CRA historically has been difficult due to data quality and
accessibility[4, 5]. The growing amount of chemicals manufactured and brought into the worldwide market
and the global integration of the chemical supply chain make this particularly concerning[6]. End-of-life
(EoL) management is complex due to uncertainty about the quantity and pathway taken by a chemical and
a dearth of data to assess chemical exposure which is why CRA sensitivity assessments are generally
insufficient[7–9].
Artificial intelligence (AI) and information technology (IT) systems transformed the chemical industry,
chemical engineering, sustainability, and life cycle assessment through digitalization[10–14]. Thus, this
manuscript shows how digitalization may streamline of MFA and CRA at chemical EoL. The topics examined
in this study encompass a data-centric approach, where the quality and accessibility of data improve over
time (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. This figure presents the machine learning life cycle applied to Chemical risk assessment (CRA)and material flow analysis
(MFA)at the end-of-life (EoL) stage. It integrates data sources, including regulatory databases and information extraction tools,
feeding into advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models support analysis and predictions related to exposure pathways and
regulatory compliance. The framework highlights how these tools collaboratively enable a data-driven approach to effective EoL
chemical management.

2. End-of-life chemical data availability
2.1.

Regulatory data sources

High-performance AI models require domain-specific data to extract “knowledge” about the EoL
supply and management chain’s behavior through data patterns. Regulatory database systems can help
collect facility-level EoL and chemical release data. The Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs),
an international publicly accessible database system created by the Organization of Economic Co3

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-06rq4 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2652-1405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

operation and Development (OECD), provides data on the releases of toxic chemicals into the air, water,
and land by industrial facilities and transferred off-site for treatment[15]. Also, the OECD uses the PRTR to
evaluate progress towards the United Nation’s twelve sustainable development goal, which promotes
sustainable consumption and production practices[16, 17].
The PRTRs from Australia, Canada, and the USA provide individual chemical transfer data[18–20]. These
publicly access databases depict EoL management scenarios with greater quantitative and qualitative
detail. The off-site material transfer report is done by chemical for all EoL scenarios, which support AI
models performance because the risk of bias is lower than with other PRTRs reporting aggregated EoL
material transfer amounts by whether the transferred material is a hazardous waste instead of informing
the constituent chemicals[21].
The USA PRTR, also known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), is highly granular, allowing data
engineering incorporation into environmental impact assessment applications. US government entities
use TRI in developing environmental input-output life cycle assessment models[22]. It helps track chemicals
through the EoL supply chain and identify waste brokering and intermediaries[23]. It also provides statistics
on on-site EoL management operations, potential pollution abatement technologies (e.g., steam
stripping), and abatement efficiencies[24]. Also, TRI integration with other data sources supports the design
and evaluation of potential chemical circular economy scenarios[25].
CRA sensitivity analysis can use regulatory data sources to reflect worst-case environmental release
scenarios despite reporting quantity thresholds, EoL material industry sector generator, and chemical
species[23]. As part of data and AI modeling, these data sources can be integrated into a data-centric
framework, where the systematic procedure remains unchanged while the sample data size (e.g.,
chemicals, threshold values, reporting facilities, etc.) and quality increase over time[26]. Thus, data
engineering pipelines can merge data silos to measure the influence of environmental regulatory

stringency and economic feasibility on the EoL supply chain across countries and time[21], expanding the
AI model domain[26].

chemicals.

This is a difficult scenario given the continually rising prevalence of toxic and hazardous chemicals. The
Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) inventory in the US lists more than 86,000 chemicals. Approximately
2,000 new chemicals are introduced annually in the US. Also, around 2,500 chemicals in the TSCA inventory
are classified as high production volume (HPV), with nearly 45 % of these HPV chemicals lack sufficient
toxicological studies to assess their health impacts on humans and wildlife[27].

CRA requires the collection of potential exposure scenarios across various life cycle stages, including
EoL. It also involves tracking chemical movements between these stages. This process must include
detailed data on chemical releases into environmental compartments and transport between them.
Additionally, environmental fate factors must be considered, such as biodegradation, bioaccumulation,
chemical transformation, and environmental persistence (see Figure 2). It is crucial to develop strategies
for the automatic data collection and management. This will expand the applicability of datasets used in
training data-driven models.

2.2.

Information extraction

Regulatory data sources can provide the EoL supply chain elements like generator/waste handler
industry sectors, inter-industry sector transfer amount, and EoL activities. But, these data sources have
limitations such as being designated as confidential business information, a limited range of regulated
substances and industrial sectors/activities, data granularity, and annual report cycle requirements[21].
Information extraction (IE) may be used to increase dataset size for AI modeling. Computer programs that
scrape webpages for data identification and collection are one example. Web scrapers have been used in
epidemiology research and public health planning[28], chemical hazards attributes and physical
properties[24, 25, 29], textile data extraction for forensic science[30], and the pharmaceutical industry
medicament requirements analysis based on prevalent diseases[31]. However, web scraping may be illegal
in some jurisdictions and prohibited by website owners[28].
Moreover, AI models can go beyond predicting EoL activities and supply chain constituents. Natural
language processing (NLP) can be used in data engineering pipelines to catalog EoL-related academic
papers and extract information from portable document format (PDF) files[32]. IE systems have used NLP
models to automatically label a corpus including superalloy names and property values for materials
research[33]. In toxicology, NLP-based EI systems have help construct biological response pathways from
literature. This advances non-animal toxicology research[34]. An NLP-based IE system helped create a

framework that automatically examines and extracts incidents reports. The framework generates risk
matrices and analyzes failure modes and effects to address wildfire damage[35].
Large language models (LLMs), a subset of NLP models, have gained attention for their ability to
understand and generate text across diverse conditional tasks. LLMs are particularly effective in IE through
prompt-based instructions, including from scientific texts[36, 37]. They are valuable for IE tasks in data
engineering pipelines for MFA and CRA during the EoL stage. LLMs have proven useful in extracting
materials science knowledge from peer-reviewed articles, including phase-property relationships in
aluminum alloys and aiding alloy design[35, 38]. They are also valuable in chemical fields for tasks like
compound entity recognition, reaction role labeling, and building databases of thermally activated
fluorescent molecules [39].

2.3.

Data augmentation

In cases of EoL data scarcity, which can cause overfitting or imbalance data for classification learning
tasks, data augmentation can improve AI model performance. Data augmentation creates more training
data using inherent patterns in existing data[40]. Previously, synthetic minority over-sampling technique
(SMOTE) and multilabel SMOTE (or MLSMOTE) were used for classification learning in the context of MFA
during the EoL stage[26].
Moreover, data augmentation was used in chemical reaction prediction to improve the synthesis
planning of reaction templates and reaction-based molecule optimization. The reaction data was
supplemented with template applicability information[41]. Other uses of data augmentation include
altering functional groups inside molecules to generate synthetic data and improve chemical reaction
predictions[42]. Also, data augmentation is used in chemical process design to digitize chemical process
flowsheets by randomly changing branches[43].
Advanced deep learning techniques can find patterns in data and generate artificial sample data for
CFA and CRA at EoL. For example, AI models have been improved to predict protein sequence solubility
7

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-06rq4 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2652-1405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

using deep learning techniques inspired in generative adversarial networks (GANs)[44]. GANs also predict
supercritical water gasification in hydrogen production[45]. Conditional GANs augment data of corrosion
generated in industrial process pipelines[46]. In biology and other fields, advanced models like the
generative pre-trained transformer 4 (GPT-4) have improved predictive modeling[47].

3. Evolution of data-driven models’ architecture
In cheminformatics and CRA, data-driven toxicity prediction models inspired in quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) models are common. QSAR models quantitatively correlate molecular
structure descriptors with response variables like the water-ethanol partition coefficient[48]. Combining
traditional AI tree-based models with QSAR models to understand the EoL supply and management chain
can yield high-performance models powered by regulatory datasets[26]. When developing a QSAR model,
tree-based algorithms can explain how each model contributes to the response variable prediction.
CRA and MFA can use state-of-the-art AI algorithms to capture more complex data patterns, but model
explainability is important. Researchers have used QSAR and deep neural networks (DNNs) in CRA and
drug development[49]. AI models that predict chemical toxicity in rats and mice have also used this
modeling synergy to reduce the need for in-vitro animal trials for hazard assessment[50]. Using previously
learned knowledge in related tasks, transfer learning improves DNNs performance. Transfer learning has
been evaluated for chemical process design using reinforcement learning in process system
engineering[51]. Transfer learning has also been applied to predict chemical properties using deep graph
neural networks (GNNs)[52].
DNNs can be used in conjunction with explainable AI (XAI) to evaluate AI models. XAI helps
stakeholders who are not computer scientists understand and rely on AI model outputs[53]. DNNs and QSAR
have been used in estimating fish bioconcentration factor research. By adding XAI, researchers were able
to score molecules’ moieties that most affect bioconcentration factor prediction[54]. Also, XAI has been
8

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-06rq4 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2652-1405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

used in supply chain management and analysis to improve explainability by combining DNNs and logicbased reasoning[55]. Thus, DNNs and QSAR could model the EoL supply and management chain for MFA
and CRA. In summary, XAI could help stakeholders and decisionmakers to prioritize modeling variables
(e.g., industry sectors, physical properties), while transfer learning could improve QSAR-inspired model
predictability.
GNNs have become more popular in chemoinformatic research, including QSAR modeling. This AI
model architecture can manage graph-structured data and learn complex topological relationships. QSARinspired GNN algorithms predict synthetic compounds toxicity, environmental behavior, and
physiochemistry[56]. GNN is useful for EoL supply chain analysis due to its edge-, node-, or full graph-level
prediction. Edge-level GNN predicts hidden linkages and tracks goods and information from suppliers to
consumers[57]. Node-level GNN has also been used to classify companies by industry sectors[58]. GNN can
introduce edges and links attributes that connect with regulatory and economical constrains, e.g., if an offsite transfers could be considered for legitimate recycling or waste-to-energy under local environmental
regulations.

as using real-world systems to gather data (e.g., internet of thing (IoT) technology) for the development of data-driven systems.
These systems aid in comprehending and tracking the progression and dynamics of the supply chain, as well as forecasting
potential risks to both humans and the environment. The system has the potential to undergo automatic re-optimization and retraining in response to changes in relationships and EoL supply chain behavior, hence mitigating the decline in predictive
performance.

4. Software and data systems infrastructure
Figure 3 presents a tiered structure that encompasses the EoL supply and management chain, diverse
data sources, and cutting-edge technologies. To understand material flow and classification, the first layer
covers the EoL supply and management chain agents like waste handler. The second layer includes various
data sources, including publicly available regulatory application programming interfaces (APIs) to analyze
the EoL chain constituents. The third layer uses AI models and internet of thing (IoT) technology to analyze
and use data sources to improve EoL supply chain decision-making, efficiency, and sustainability.
Recent years have seen exponential growth in data systems and software infrastructure. Open-source
initiatives make modern technologies more accessible and created an ecosystem for quickly developing
and testing new ideas. The OECD’s QSAR Toolbox allows CRA practitioners to share research papers,
datasets, and models for future projects[59, 60]. Other open-source QSAR modeling projects include QSARCo-X for multitarget QSAR modelling[61], and MRA Toolbox for mixture risk assessment[62]. These tools can
speed up AI model training for EoL supply chain understanding as shown in Figure 3. DNNs can also provide
data for new model training or transfer learning using QSAR-inspired models.
New technologies make it easier to supply data assets, especially with the rise of AI applications and
the data transparency and accessibility. The U.S. Census Bureau provides APIs on the country’s industry
economy[63], the U.S. Center for Disease Control Prevention provides environmental public health APIs[64],
the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration delivers workplace injuries APIs[65], and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s CompTox provides computational toxicology APIs[66]. Data engineering
pipeline can combine siloed API systems as shown in Figure 3, to extract useful features for modeling the
EoL supply chain while considering various factors.
Also, the rise of IoT has great potential for EoL supply chain integration. The IoT uses sensors, software,
data processing, and other technologies to simplify internet and communication network connections. IoT

may revolutionize EoL material management by increasing efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and
promoting material circularity[67]. IoT may be a valuable source of real-time data that can be integrated
into DNNs for real-time biological and non-biological EoL material categorization and sorting via computer
vision[68]. IoT and blockchain technology have been used in the chemical supply chain to ensure traceability
and transparency[69]. IoT and blockchain could provide real-time data for CRA and MFA. They can track
chemicals in the EoL supply chain and use real-time data for environmental decision-making and AI
modeling. Figure 3 shows how data can classify EoL material generators, brokers, and handlers and retrain
AI models to maintain performance.

Conclusion
This contribution shows how advanced software and data systems can enhance CRA and MFA at the
EoL stage. As shown in earlier publications [25, 26], using n-Hexane as an example, data engineering pipelines
play a crucial role by integrating information from regulatory databases like PRTRs and TRI and extracting
additional insights from academic and industrial documents using NLP. This combined approach allows the
identification of specific facilities responsible for n-Hexane releases, quantities transferred off-site,
industrial processes involved, and missing data to complete regulatory records. Such integration helps
identify key exposure pathways, track waste flows, and analyze abatement technologies.
ML models, including DNNs and GNNs, leverage these enriched datasets to predict exposure scenarios
and assess risks associated with environmental parameters like bioaccumulation, volatility, and
persistence. By uncovering patterns in chemical releases and transport, these models help estimate risks
across the entire lifecycle of n-Hexane. XAI techniques further enhance the interpretability of model
predictions, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of the factors that most influence the
model’s risk assessments. The approach promotes safer and more efficient chemical management
practices and supports regulatory compliance.
