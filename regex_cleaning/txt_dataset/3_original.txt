Abstract

12

Non-detects—measurements reported as “below the detection limit”—are ubiquitous in

13

environmental science and engineering. They are frequently replaced with a constant,

14

but this biases estimates of means, regression slopes, and correlation coefficients.

15

Omitting non-detects is worse, and has led to serious errors. Simple alternatives are

16

available: rank-based statistics, maximum likelihood estimation, and re-purposed

17

survival analysis routines. But many environmental datasets do not align well with the

18

assumptions these methods make—it is often necessary to account for hierarchy (e.g.,

19

measurements nested within lakes), sampling strategy (e.g., measurements collected

20

as time series), heterogeneity (e.g., site-dependent variance), and measurement error.

21

Bayesian methods offer the flexibility to do this; incorporating non-detects is also easy

22

and does not bias model parameter estimates as substitution does. Here we discuss

23

Bayesian implementations of common bivariate and multivariate statistical methods

24

relevant to environmental science. We use a dataset comprising time series of Ag, As,

25

Cd, Ce, Co, Sb, Ti, U, and V concentrations in municipal biosolids that includes many

26

non-detects. The models can be reproduced and extended to new problems using the

27

data and code accompanying this paper.

Introduction

31

Non-detects—measurements recorded as less than a detection or reporting limit—are

32

ubiquitous in environmental science and engineering. In the statistical literature, they

33

are known as left-censored observations. A popular method of representing them in

34

statistical routines is to replace them with one-half, or some other fraction, of the

35

detection limit. But while common, this strategy can severely bias estimates based on

36

the data when the censoring rate is high. Worse still is omission—leaving out non-

37

detects has led to serious and well-documented errors.1

38

For basic tasks like comparing two groups or estimating a mean, linear regression

39

slope, or correlation coefficient, there are simple alternatives to substitution and

40

omission. These include rank-based methods, maximum likelihood estimation, and re-

41

purposed survival analysis routines.1 But many environmental datasets require more

42

complex models that account for hierarchy, sampling strategy, heterogeneity, and

43

measurement error. For instance, measurements may be collected across multiple

44

lakes with different characteristics or they may be recorded as time series (i.e., serially

45

dependent data). The standard toolbox for censored data analysis does not always

46

accommodate these features.

47

Bayesian methods excel in this context—since the sampling techniques they rely on

48

provide a near-universal approach to parameter estimation, they can be very flexible. In

49

particular, it is straightforward to account for non-detects in almost any model. Here, we

provide examples of common statistical models in environmental science and

51

engineering whose Bayesian versions can easily accommodate non-detects. They are

Data collection

55

We fit models to a dataset comprising concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Ce, Co, Sb, Ti, U,

56

and V in municipal biosolids. Biosolids samples were collected from the clarifiers of

57

three wastewater treatment facilities in 125 mL polypropylene bottles. Samples were

58

autoclaved, desiccated by baking at 105°C for approximately 60 hours, digested

59

according to EPA Method 3050B,2 diluted serially, and quantified by inductively coupled

60

plasma mass spectrometry according to Standard Method 3125.3 A summary of the

61

data is available in Table 1.

Results and discussion

Bayesian modeling

71

Bayesian inference entails fitting a probability model to data, then summarizing it as the

72

joint distribution of the model parameters, 𝜃.13 The model starts as a prior, 𝑃(𝜃),

73

quantifying the plausibility of all possible parameter values. The prior reflects

74

background knowledge and practical considerations.14

75

The data, 𝑥, are used to update the prior via Bayes’ theorem. It relates the posterior or

76

updated joint parameter distribution, 𝑃(𝜃|𝑥), with the prior and the likelihood. The

77

likelihood, 𝑃(𝑥|𝜃), quantifies the compatibility of the data with the proposed model.

78

In practice, model fitting follows these basic steps:

Assign a probability distribution to the data.
Choose a model for each of the distributional parameters.
Choose a distribution of prior probability for each parameter.
Iterate the following steps to obtain a sample from the posterior:
(a) Propose values for all parameters.
(b) Quantify their plausibility without reference to the data (via the prior distributions).
(c) Quantify the plausibility of each data point given the assumed data distribution and the
proposed parameter values (i.e., the likelihood).
(d) Obtain the relative posterior probability as the product of the likelihood and the prior (i.e.,
Bayes’ theorem).

89

Iterating over steps 4 (a–d) may require searching a high-dimensional parameter space,

90

which is often accomplished via the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm.14 Fortunately,

91

software packages make this straightforward: the R package brms7, for instance, fits a

92

huge variety of Bayesian regression models—including censored data models—with a

93

standard and familiar syntax. Further customization is possible using Stan,15 a

94

programming platform for Bayesian statistics written in C++.

95

Substitution biases parameter estimates

96

Replacing non-detects with a constant can bias parameter estimates substantially,

97

especially when the censoring rate is high. We show this using a small simulation study

98

that compares substitution at one-half the detection limit with a parameter estimation

99

strategy that relies on the cumulative distribution function.

100

When the dependent variable in a linear regression model includes left-censored

101

observations, one method of accounting for them is to construct the likelihood for every

102

censored observation using the appropriate cumulative distribution function in place of

103

the probability density function. Here, the cumulative distribution function quantifies the

104

probability that a data point is less than the detection limit—that is, the compatibility of a

105

non-detect with the proposed model. The likelihood, then, becomes 𝑃(𝑥|𝜃) =

106

𝐹(𝑥!"#$%&$' |𝜃)𝐺(𝑥($)#!%$' |𝜃), where 𝐹 and 𝐺 are the probability density and cumulative

107

distribution functions, respectively.

108

We simulated from a simple linear regression model, 𝑦* ∼ 𝑁(𝜇* = 3 + 0.15𝑥* , 𝜎 = 0.5),

109

where the dependent variable was partially censored—here, 𝑁 represents the normal

110

distribution with mean 𝜇* and standard deviation 𝜎. We fit a censored regression using

111

brms where the simulated non-detects were modeled using the normal cumulative

112

distribution function. We compared it to a naive model where the non-detects were

113

replaced with one-half the detection limit.

114

Specifically, the 𝑖 simulated observations, 𝑦* , were modeled as follows. Except for the

115

special handling of left-censored observations (𝑦* |𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑* = 1), the naive model was

116

identical.
likelihood:
𝑦* |𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑* = 0 ∼ 𝑁(𝜇* , 𝜎) [𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 ]
𝑦* |𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑* = 1 ∼ 𝑁-𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝜇* , 𝜎) [𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡-𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑 ]

𝜎 ∼ 𝑇(𝜇/ = 0, 𝜎/ = 2.5, 𝜈/ = 3)

118

In equation (1), 𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑* is a binary variable (0 = 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑, 1 = 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡-𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑑), and

119

𝑁-𝐶𝐷𝐹 is the normal cumulative distribution function (i.e., 𝑃(𝑋 ≤ 𝑥), the probability that

120

a random variable 𝑋 is less than or equal to some value 𝑥).14,15 The parameters 𝛽+ and

Figure 1. (a) One iteration of the linear regression simulation. The model that accounts
for left-censoring via the cumulative distribution function recovered the true model
parameters well, whereas the naive model that used substitution at one-half the
detection limit was biased. Points represent observations, and vertical dashed grey lines
represent left-censored values. (b) The same pattern was evident across the entire
simulation: the censored regression model recovered the true parameters well and the
naive model was biased.

131

The censored regression model recovered the true parameter values much more

132

accurately than the naive model (Figure 1). That is, the censored model yielded 95%

133

credible intervals on the intercept, slope, and residual standard deviation that included

134

the true parameter values 96, 98, and 97% of the time, respectively. The naive model

135

yielded intervals that included the true values just 2, 14, and 1% of the time.

136

Accounting for non-detects in a more complex model

137

The same strategy can be incorporated into more complex models: here, we use a

138

dataset of metals concentrations in municipal biosolids to demonstrate fitting a

139

smoothing spline, a popular method for characterizing environmental time series and

140

other problems.16–19 It was fitted using bgamcar1,4 an extension of brms that

141

accommodates continuous-time autoregression—accounting for the dependence of one

142

observation on the previous one in unequally spaced time series.16,20 Titanium

143

concentrations at three wastewater treatment facilities (Sites 1–3) were modeled as

144

follows:
likelihood:

𝜇0 = 𝛼 + 𝛽#*0$ 𝑋#*0$ + 𝑓 (𝑡) + 𝜙 # 𝑟01#
𝑟01# = 𝑙𝑜𝑔([𝑇𝑖]01# ) − 𝛼 − 𝑓(𝑡 − 𝑠)

𝜎 ∼ 𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑓-𝑇(𝜇/ = 0, 𝜎/ = 2.5, 𝜈/ = 3)
𝛽#*0$ ∼ 𝑇J𝜇. = 0, 𝜎. = 2.5, 𝜈. = 3M
𝜈 ∼ 𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎 (𝜇2 = 2, 𝛼2 = 0.1)
𝜙 ∼ 𝑁J𝜇3 = 0.5, 𝜎3 = 0.5M
𝛼 ∼ 𝑇(𝜇4 = 0, 𝜎4 = 2.5, 𝜈4 = 3)

146

where, in addition to the symbols defined above, 𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑓-𝑇 represents the positive-valued t

147

distribution and 𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎 the gamma distribution, parameterized by mean 𝜇 and shape

148

parameter 𝛼. The linear model 𝛽#*0$ 𝑋#*0$ estimates a separate intercept for each site,

149

where 𝑋#*0$ is the design matrix and 𝛽#*0$ the coefficients. The autocorrelation

150

coefficient, 𝜙 # , and the residual at time 𝑡 − 𝑠, 𝑟01# , define the dependence of each

151

observation on the previous one, where 𝑠 is the spacing between adjacent

152

observations.16,20

on the previous one, after accounting for trends and site-specific variation. The serial

169

correlation parameter in the model, 𝜙, had a posterior median of 0.11 with a 95%

170

credible interval spanning 0.03–0.26. In general, accounting for serial correlation

171

improves the accuracy of predictions and helps avoid overfitting.16,22

172

A censored predictor

173

Left-censoring may also occur in the predictor variable. One potential application is

174

building a linear regression model to predict missing values in one variable using

175

another, partially censored, variable. Left-censored predictors, though, are not

176

amenable to substituting a cumulative distribution function in the likelihood—another

177

strategy is required.

from three treatment facilities. Nondetect cadmium concentrations are represented as
horizontal lines extending to the detection limit. A robust (Student t) linear model is
superimposed in blue and the shaded region represents a 95% credible interval on the
posterior mean. The equivalent non-robust model yields an extremely wide credible
interval due to the unusually high cobalt concentration of 309 µg g-1. Coordinates
outside the plotting limits are annotated in parentheses.

186

Fortunately, there is a straightforward alternative: all the non-detects can be treated as

187

missing values with an upper bound and represented by parameters in the model. Since

188

Bayesian modeling results in a set of posterior draws—vectors of plausible parameter

189

values—this is similar to multiple imputation of missing values with an upper—and

190

optionally a lower—bound. But since it is done in one step, we get a joint distribution

191

that quantifies the uncertainty and interrelationships among all the parameters, including

192

the censored values.23 This might be important, for instance, when there is serial

193

dependence in the data.

194

Another advantage is the size of the imputed dataset: since the model is fitted to the

195

data just once, it is straightforward to generate several thousand imputed values, even

196

for complex models. This may not be practical if values are imputed before model fitting:

197

the conventional imputation strategy entails fitting one model for each set of imputed

198

values. Furthermore, it may be difficult to find a multiple imputation routine that meets all

199

of the needs of a particular data analysis.

200

Using the Bayesian approach, we can specify any predictive model we would like to

201

impute the censored values. Since there were only a few censored observations in this

202

pair of variables (Figure 3), we chose a simple intercept-only imputation model, fitted

203

using bgamcar14. It was defined as follows:
likelihood:
[𝐶𝑜]* ∼ 𝑇J𝜇[8!]" , 𝜎[8!] , 𝜈[8!] M
[𝐶𝑑]* ∼ 𝑇J𝜇[8'] , 𝜎[8'] , 𝜈[8'] M

204

(4)

model for 𝜇:
𝜇[8!]" = 𝛽+[$%] + 𝛽, [𝐶𝑑]*
𝜇[8']" = 𝛽+[$']
priors:
𝛽- ∼ 𝑇J𝜇. = 0, 𝜎. = 2.5, 𝜈. = 3M, for j = 0,1
𝜎 ∼ 𝑇(𝜇/ = 0, 𝜎/ = 2.5, 𝜈/ = 3)
𝜈 ∼ 𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎(𝜇2 = 2, 𝛼2 = 0.1)

205

When the model was fitted with a Gaussian likelihood, the extreme cobalt concentration

206

of 309 µg g-1 yielded a posterior mean with an extremely wide credible interval (Figure

207

3). The robust model, fitted with a Student t likelihood, yielded a much narrower credible

208

interval and a posterior mean that was much less heavily influenced by the extreme

209

value. A disadvantage of both models is that simulating from them may generate

210

negative concentrations, even though the posterior mean remains positive over its

211

range. This could be solved by modeling log-transformed Co concentrations instead,

212

resulting in a slightly different interpretation: the model would then predict geometric

213

mean concentrations on the scale of measurement.24

214

Multivariate models

215

In a multivariate context, the one-step multiple imputation strategy is often simpler to

216

apply, since multivariate cumulative distribution functions can be difficult to implement.

217

Two multivariate models with applications in environmental science are the intercept-

218

only model, used to estimate a correlation matrix, and principal component analysis.

219

A Bayesian correlation matrix

220

In addition to handling non-detects, Bayesian correlation has the advantage that it can

221

be readily applied to variables that are best described using distributions other than the

222

Gaussian. A relevant example for environmental sciences is robust correlation, where a

223

Student t distribution is assigned to each variable and its parameters estimated. This

224

tends to limit the influence of extreme values, which might otherwise exert undue

225

influence on the estimated correlation coefficients.

226

Given 𝑦, an 𝑁 × 𝐷 matrix containing 𝑁 concentrations of 𝐷 elements, we can estimate

227

the pairwise correlations as follows:

Arsenic, vanadium, and cadmium concentrations were most strongly correlated in

biosolids (Figure 4). And overall, the robust model—incorporating Student t

240

241

robust model fitted with Gaussian likelihoods. This is due to the much smaller influence

that extreme values have on the robust model.

Probabilistic principal components analysis

244

Principal component analysis is a method for summarizing a multivariate dataset using

245

a subset of derived variables that capture the majority of the data’s variance.25 Here we

246

implement probabilistic principal component analysis, a Bayesian generalization of the

247

classical approach.26 Our model is modified from the approach described in a recent

248

paper27 to accommodate left-censoring of the data and is written in Stan8,15. Given 𝑦, a

Figure 5. (a) The dataset projected onto the first two probabilistic principal components
(z in equation (6)). Values appearing outside the extents of the plot are annotated in
parentheses at the margins. (b) The first two principal axes; that is, the orthonormalized
columns of the transformation matrix 𝑊.

260

Differences in metals concentrations among the three sites are apparent in Figure 5a. In

261

particular, Site 3 scored differently on the two principal components, resulting in

262

substantial separation in the two-component space from the data representing the other

263

two sites. Differences in titanium concentrations among treatment facilities play a strong

264

role here: the principal axes—that is, the orthonormalized columns of the transformation

265

matrix 𝑊 (equation 6)—load titanium concentrations heavily. And titanium

266

concentrations were high in biosolids from Site 3 relative to Sites 1 and 2 (Figure 2).

Conclusion

268

Replacing non-detects with a constant—often one-half the detection limit—biases

269

estimates of means, regression slopes, and correlation coefficients. Simple alternatives

270

exist, but they are limited and not always applicable to complex environmental datasets

271

that exhibit hierarchy, complex dependence structures, and heterogeneity. Bayesian

272

methods have the flexibility to model all of these features, and they can easily

273

accommodate left-censoring by either modifying the likelihood or one-step multiple

274

imputation as a part of model fitting.
