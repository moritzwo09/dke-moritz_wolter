Abstract
Lignin valorization has become an urgent priority due to its status as the most
abundant natural biopolymer containing aromatic structures, yet industrially
unexploited. In this study, we present a photocatalytic method using a simple
anthraquinone catalyst to break down lignin's recalcitrant structure into valuable
monomers. Notably, this process is described under flow conditions for the first time.
The monomer yields achieved are the highest reported in literature, although lignin is
not fully depolymerized. However, the remaining oligomers can be effectively
repurposed as polylactic acid (PLA) plasticizers, significantly enhancing PLA's mechanical
properties and imparting shape-memory behavior. Thus, by processing lignin through a
photochemical flow reactor, it is fully converted either into industrially relevant
monomers, such as vanillin and syringaldehyde, or fragmented sufficiently for use as
PLA plasticizers. This approach ensures that no wasteful by-products are generated,
offering a sustainable pathway for lignin valorization.

Introduction
For the past two decades, society has been repeatedly warned about the
imminent depletion of fossil fuel reserves, yet for the vast majority of people this fact
impacted solely on the decision on whether it is the right time to purchase an electric
vehicle. However, the dire consequence of this reliance on petrochemical industry is not
only the continuous rise in costs1 but also the escalating environmental damage due to
greenhouse gas emissions. To address this, the 2015 Paris Agreement introduced limits
on oil extraction.2, 3However, the significance of petrochemicals extends far beyond
fuels. They are the foundation of many essential products in our modern lives, from
polymeric materials to pharmaceuticals, all of which rely on key components derived
from petroleum.4 As a result, the need to seek alternative energy solutions has become
urgent, but equally critical is the development of renewable sources for chemical
feedstocks.5, 6
Today, lignocellulosic biomass is considered a valuable resource, though its
potential remains largely untapped due to the lack of efficient valorization

technologies.7 This type of biomass consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Both
cellulose and hemicellulose have found various applications, such as in the paper
industry or ethanol production for cellulose, 8, 9 and in the production of materials and
fine chemicals like xylitol and furfural for hemicellulose. 10 However, lignin, which makes
up approximately 25% of the total wood mass, is still regarded as a waste product.
Despite being the primary by-product of the pulp and paper industry, less than 3% of
lignin is used to produce commercial compounds, with the rest being burned as lowenergy fuel.11
This fact is better understood when examining Lignin’s chemical structure. Lignin
is a biopolymer formed by aromatic monomers in a sequence and structure which are
not well-defined. Its biosynthesis is performed on cell walls in an irregular manner via
free-radical coupling mechanisms, resulting in an extremely complex structure. 12 There
are primarily three main repeating units (monolignols), arranged in random sequences.
The major contributors to lignin’s primary structure are p-coumaryl (H), coniferyl (G),
and sinapyl (S) alcohols, making lignin an unrivaled source for obtaining aromatic
compounds without depending on petroleum.13 But despite having only three main
monomers, the lignification process occurring in plants produces a recalcitrant material
from which obtaining usable monomers is not a trivial matter.
Over the last decades, several methodologies to valorize lignin have been
proposed,14 including pyrolysis,15 hydrogenolysis,16 acid/base depolymerization17 or
oxidation.18 However, up to now most of these methods are (i) energy-intensive, which
increases costs and environmental impact, and depends on (ii) harsh treatments that
irreversibly alter the nature of the aromatic compounds, thereby reducing the profit
margin in the market. Recently, the use of photocatalytic systems has been proposed to
carry out lignin fragmentation. These systems allow for more selective fragmentation,
operating under ambient conditions and using only solar energy to activate the process.
Some of the recent examples of photocatalytic lignin valorization make use of metallic
species, like vanadium19 tungsten20 or iridium21 complexes (figure 1). Despite the
versatility of some of these catalysts, several disadvantages limit their applicability,
including the typically high price and the inconvenient heavy metal contamination of
products if drug or alimentary products are intended to be produced. In addition, these
types of processes are performed under batch conditions, being not suitable for largescale applications due to some disadvantages for scaling up; mainly (i) the reactor must
be completely stopped after each reaction to extract the system's contents and isolate
the reaction products, and (ii) additional processes are necessary to recover the catalyst
after each reaction. Furthermore, most of these processes have been limited to lignin
model compounds or have focused on qualitative lignin fragmentation without
achieving actual monomer isolation. Consequently, a continuous flow method for
producing valuable aromatic aldehydes from lignin remains absent from the literature.

Results and discussion
Thus, we envisioned the development of a photocatalytic lignin valorization
process, but seeking a potential industrial applicability, metallic catalysts were avoided
and the use of an inexpensive organic photocatalyst was envisioned. More specifically,
we focused our attention on anthraquinones, which are a group of natural pigments
found in common dyes that have been proposed as versatile and inexpensive
photosensitizers.22, 23 These compounds possess high absorptivity and are effective
hydrogen atom acceptors, being able to oxidize molecules under photocatalytic
conditions using atmospheric O2 as terminal oxidant.22
To start with this endeavor, the photochemical cleavage of 2-phenoxy-1phenylethanol (2a) was chosen as model reaction, as it serves as a proof of concept of
the system ability to break the β-O-4 bonds present in lignin structure. A survey of
reaction conditions was performed, including different solvents,24 photocatalysts and
additives. The highest conversion was obtained using 20 mol% of anthraquinone in
MeCN, while other solvents like DCM or HFIP afforded good conversion of 2a but low
selectivity towards the β-O-4-like bond cleavage, yielding oxidized byproducts like 2phenoxy-1-phenylethan-1-one, among others. It is worth noting that performing the
reaction under air atmosphere boosted the conversion, although slightly varying the
product selectivity (table 1, entries 1-2). It was observed that along with benzaldehyde
(3a), benzoic acid (3a’) was also obtained as an oxidation product of the former when
the reaction was performed under extended reaction times, although carefully
controlling the reaction time could maximize the ratio of products 3a/3a’. In addition,
instead of finding phenol (4a) and anisole (4a’’) as a result of the bond cleavage, phenyl

formate (4a’) was obtained as a major product. To gain some insight on the reaction
mechanism, we performed some control experiments. When a solution of 2a was
irradiated for 16 h without catalyst the starting material was recovered almost entirely,
proving the role of anthraquinone as photocatalyst (Table 1, entry 3). Since a radical
mechanism is expected, a reaction was set under standard conditions but adding 2
equivalents of TEMPO as a radical scavenger. The reaction was greatly inhibited,
observing only 4% conversion to benzaldehyde. In addition, we were able to isolate one
adduct of TEMPO with a fragment of PPol, providing some insights on the mechanistic
pathway of the reaction (table 1, entry 4, figure 2A).

Reaction conditions: To a vial containing 2a (21.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) and anthraquinone (4.1 mg, 0.02 mmol),
MeCN (1 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under irradiation using a
365 nm LED lamp for 16 h.

process (figure 2B).25 Deuteration experiments were also conducted to shed some light
on the reaction mechanism. The deuterated substrate 2a-D was synthesized and tested
in the model reaction. When it was employed as substrate, deuterated benzaldehyde
was obtained (3a-D), while using it in competition in an equimolar amount of 2a for
short reaction times afforded a product ratio of 3aH/3aD = 1.1, indicating that that the
hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process is probably not a turnover limiting step for this
reaction.26
Based on these results, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed (Figure 2D).
Similar reported reaction pathways start with a Cβ-H dehydrogenation process, leading
Cα-Cβ cleavage.27 In contrast, the present reaction might begin with compound 2a
undergoing a hydrogen atom transfer process facilitated by the excited anthraquinone.
This step triggers a radical rearrangement, resulting in the release of benzaldehyde (3a)
and a radical anisole intermediate. The intermediate, whose presence was proven by
trapping it with TEMPO, confirms this pathway (Figure 2A). Anisole radical can then
follow two mechanisms: it may either extract another hydrogen atom from the
substrate or react with molecular oxygen to form an oxidized intermediate. This
intermediate undergoes a second HAT event, regenerating the catalyst and releasing
phenyl formate (4a’). Subsequently, phenyl formate can degrade in the presence of
water into phenol (4a) and formic acid (detected by 1H NMR, see Figure S2).
These findings are in stark contrast with most photocatalyzed lignin
fragmentation processes, in which the bond cleavage is produced at the C β-O ether
bond, affording acetophenone instead of benzaldehyde.20, 21In some reports, the
process starts with HAT removing the hydrogen atom directly attached to Cα or by
removing one electron from the aromatic ring,28 but we proposed an O-H bond cleavage
to start the catalytic cycle. To gain more insight into which mechanism is more probable
using anthraquinone as catalyst, DFT calculations were performed, and the two different
approaches were compared in energy. As can be seen in figure 3, the C-H
dehydrogenation approach is c.a. 50 kcal/mol more energetic that the O-H pathway.

Once anthraquinone was demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst for β-O4 bond cleavage in a simple lignin model compound (2a) under homogeneous
conditions, we decided to go one step further to improve the applicability of the method
and envisioned a supported catalytic system to adapt this approach to a heterogeneous
catalysis. Such a transition would make the method more suitable for industrial
upscaling, as the catalyst could be easily recovered after the reaction and used in a
continuous-flow photocatalytic reactor. Even though anthraquinone is an organic and
inexpensive molecule, performing the lignin valorization in the presence of this catalyst
in a homogeneous way would mean an extra purification step. In addition, the presence
of these catalysts in the crude product could be potentially problematic for applications
on the cosmetic, alimentary, or pharmaceutical industries.34 However, using a
supported photocatalyst in which units are immobilized on a fixed bed,35 those problems
would be solved. To do so, several inexpensive supports were chosen, including
polystyrene-based resins,36 glass wool,37 silica gel38 and alumina39 (see supporting
information page S4), with best results obtained with silica-supported anthraquinone
(AQ@SiO2)
With an efficient heterogeneous system developed, catalyst recyclability was
studied. Thus, the model reaction was performed in the presence of AQ@SiO2. Once the
reaction was completed, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, dried in vacuo
and reused for a new cycle with a fresh solution of 2a. In this way, the catalyst was used
for 5 cycles without a detrimental effect on the reaction yield or selectivity (Figure 4B).
Being proved that the heterogeneous photocatalyst could perform the model reaction,
a photocatalytic flow reactor was built. To do so, a peristaltic pump was used to make
the starting material solution pass through a transparent column (1 cm internal
diameter) inert to the employed radiation. This column was filled with the supported
catalyst, ensuring that the reaction takes place as the solution flows through the column
(Figure 4C). Reaction profiles were plotted, observing that the reaction is even faster
using the supported catalyst (either on batch or under flow conditions, Figure 4A) than
using unsupported anthraquinone. It is expected that using longer and thinner columns
can greatly improve the reaction rate and efficiency in potential industrial application.40

With the development of three equivalent catalytic systems— i) anthraquinone
(AQ), ii) silica-supported anthraquinone under batch conditions (AQ@SiO₂ batch), and
iii) silica-supported anthraquinone under flow conditions (AQ@SiO₂ flow)—a study was
conducted using increasingly complex lignin model dimers. Initially, dimer 2a was
substituted with other dimers featuring various functional groups that mimic structures
found in native lignin (Figure 5). As outlined in the reaction mechanism, the
photocatalyzed cleavage of 2a predominantly yields benzaldehyde, which can be further
oxidized to benzoic acid under prolonged exposure to air. This C–C bond cleavage also
generates an anisole radical that can evolve into several products, primarily anisole,
phenyl formate, or phenol. However, this radical may also form other by-products. The
resulting phenolic compounds, such as phenol or guaiacol, are unstable under the
reaction conditions, which accounts for their lower yields compared to the carbonylic
compounds. When compound 2b, containing a methoxy group on the phenolic ring, was
used as a substrate, the selectivity shifted due to the compound's electronic properties.
The C–C cleavage was incomplete, yielding α-hydroxyacetophenone in addition to
benzaldehyde. Although 2b is not representative of the most common structures in
native lignin, it provides insight into how substrate nature influences reactivity. Given
the intrinsic complexity of natural lignin, a mixture of products is typically expected.
Compound 2c, incorporating an additional carbon (Cγ) found in real lignin, was tested
to assess its impact on reactivity. The cleavage proceeded similarly, releasing a formic
acid molecule without significant changes in the reaction pathway (Figure S2).
Introducing an extra methoxy group on the benzylic ring (compound 2d) afforded similar

reactivity to the one observed with 2a, yielding primarily p-methoxybenzoic acid when
using anthraquinone or silica-supported anthraquinone as catalysts. As previously
noted, the aldehydes formed can be oxidized to carboxylic acids in the presence of air.
Interestingly, conducting the reaction with 2d under flow conditions inhibited acid
formation, selectively producing the aldehyde due to reduced oxygen availability in the
packed column. Finally, compounds 2e and 2f were successfully cleaved under all three
catalytic conditions. However, 2f exhibited slower reaction rates in batch systems,
achieving full conversion in 16 hours under flow conditions.

After achieving promising results with dimer cleavage, we proceeded to test our
method on a polymeric model before applying it to real lignin samples.41 While the
dimer studies demonstrated excellent outcomes, lignin’s inherently complex polymeric
structure posed additional challenges. To bridge this gap, we synthesized a polymeric
model that closely mimics the structure of natural lignin and subjected it to our reaction
conditions. This approach facilitated a more straightforward analysis of the degradation
process, offering deeper insights into the catalyst's behavior. Heteronuclear Single
Quantum Coherence (HSQC) analysis clearly confirmed the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds,

along with a shift in the aromatic region, indicating the formation of new species (Figure
6A). Additionally, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis revealed that the
synthetic polymer (G) initially had a molecular weight (Mw) of 3024 g/mol. After 16
hours of irradiation using our supported catalyst, the average molecular weight was
significantly reduced to 623 g/mol, with peaks corresponding to dimers and monomers
observed (Figure 6B).

reaction with AQ@SiO2.
Having successfully concluded the study of lignin dimeric and polymeric models,
we shifted our focus to real organosolv lignin. To this end, we selected lignin samples
from various sources, including bamboo, and pine, representing both hardwood and
softwood types. Our objective was to extract monomers such as vanillin and
syringaldehyde. As with the lignin dimeric models, the lignin samples were subjected to
three catalytic processes: homogeneous anthraquinone (AQ), supported anthraquinone
on silica (AQ@SiO2) under batch conditions, and AQ@SiO2 under flow conditions. Table
3 presents both the total content of vanillin and syringaldehyde determined via the
standardized nitrobenzene oxidation method,42 and the yields of these monomers
relative to their total content in the samples under specified conditions.
In general, moderate yields were obtained using homogeneous anthraquinone
as catalyst, while the supported catalyst (AQ@SiO2) typically improved the yields.
Notably, the analysis of model compounds was performed in acetonitrile; however, real
lignin samples often exhibited limited solubility in this solvent at high concentrations.
To address this issue and minimize its impact on the reaction outcome, lignin samples
were acetylated, resulting in significantly improved solubility in acetonitrile. This
improvement is evident in the case of bamboo lignin (entry 2), where the acetylated

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-pwppb ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4914-2918 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

version showed significantly higher monomer yields compared to its unmodified
counterpart (entry 1), yielding the corresponding acetylated monomers (vanillin acetate
or syringaldehyde acetate). A similar trend was observed for pine lignin, which initially
exhibited particularly low solubility, yielding only 15% of the total vanillin content with
AQ@SiO2. However, when considering only the soluble fraction, this corresponded to a
75% yield. The yield was further improved by performing the reaction with acetylated
pine lignin (entry 4). Gram scale reaction was also performed with dioxasolv pine lignin
under photochemical flow conditions. By doing so, vanillin was not only detected but
also isolated in high purity in a 94% yield considering the soluble lignin fraction.

Further characterization of the reaction extended beyond monomer analysis.
The average molecular weight of the samples before and after the reaction was
measured using GPC, and qualitative analysis was conducted via HSQC (Figures 7, S5 and
table S1). As observed with the polymeric model, signals corresponding to β-O-4
linkages were notably weakened or depleted after the reaction (Figure 7A),
accompanied by a significant reduction in the average molecular weight, as determined
by GPC. To demonstrate scalability, a gram-scale reaction was performed using
dioxasolv pine lignin under photochemical flow conditions. Vanillin was successfully
detected and isolated in high purity, achieving a 94% yield based on the soluble lignin
fraction (Figure 7C). proving the usefulness of the process.

As seen in figure 7 and table 3, we were able to obtain monomers such as vanillin,
but a residue of oligomers was still present. Thus, we envisioned a way to valorize this
residue in some application that prevents us from relying on fossil reserves. Apart from
fuels, another field in which fosil resources are unmatched is in the polymers area.
Nowadays, petrol-based polymers such as polystyrene are trying to be replaced by
biorenewable and biodegradable materials, such as Poly(lactide) (PLA), which has
gained great relevance in recent decades due to its environmentally friendly attributes,
stemming from its biodegradability and its origin from renewable resources.43 PLA
exhibits interesting properties, such as high mechanical strength, transparency,

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-pwppb ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4914-2918 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

moderate barrier properties, and rather good processability, making it an ideal
candidate for diverse applications in automotive industry, packaging, biomedical
devices, tissue engineering, and 3D printing.44, 45, 46, 47, 48 However, its widespread use is
hindered by critical limitations, related to its intrinsic brittleness, which restricts its use
in applications requiring high impact resistance. To improve the mechanical properties
of PLA and reduce its cost, formulation with different additives have been reported. In
this sense, lignin has been proposed a promising filler for PLA composites offering the
potential to achieve a balance of low cost, and multifunctionality, all while adhering to
principles of biodegradability and sustainability. However, the poor compatibility
between PLA and lignin significantly impacts the overall performance of these
composites, posing a major challenge to their development.49 One technical approach
to overcome this drawback is plasticization 50. The addition of a plasticizer to PLA
enhances the chain mobility as the free volume increases. This leads to a reduction in
the glass transition temperature (Tg), serving as a quantifiable parameter to evaluate
the plasticization efficiency.51 Various compounds, including monomeric plasticizers
such as citrates52, carbonates53, cinnamates54, terpenes55, adipates56, as well as
oligomeric/polymeric plasticizers such as lactic acid oligomers (OLA),57 polyethylene
glycol (PEG)58, and others, have been extensively explored to improve the mechanical
flexibility and toughness of PLA. An emerging alternative with significant potential
involves the use waste materials as base compounds for designing new efficient
plasticizers.59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 Thus, instead of using lignin as a mere filler, we envisioned its
use as plastification agent. Oligomers resulting after our photochemical lignin
valorization process were rich in phenolic compounds, and therefore they could be
esterified with fatty acids. The unique molecular architecture of the resulting esters
incorporates aromatic rings that enhance polarity, while ester groups provide
interactions with aliphatic polyester chains, and hydrocarbon chains can contribute to
flexibility. 65, 66 This combination of features positions lignin-based esters as promising
plasticizers to mitigate PLA's brittleness while maintaining its eco-friendly profile and
providing it with enhanced toughness.
Lignin oligomers residue obtained after photochemical reacion of organosolv
bamboo lignin were subjected to a esterification process with two naturally occurring
carboxylic acids, namely caprylic and oleic acids. Unfragmented organosolv bamboo
lignin was subjected to the same process for comparison purposes. The plasticized
materials consisting of PLA were successfully processed by extrusion and injection
molding processes. As expected, due to the intense dark brown color of all three ligninbased esters, plasticized samples with these esters showed a dark brown opaque
appearance typical of lignin-containing blends67, 68 (see supporting information for
further details). Some softwoods show color coordinates in this same region,69 thus
indicating these materials based on PLA and lignin-based esters show a wood-like
appearance (Table S2, Figure S10).

As previously indicated, one of the main drawbacks of PLA is its intrinsic
brittleness, with elongation at break values of 10-12%, and lower. Plasticizers can
improve toughness by increasing the free volume and allowing chain mobility. This can
be assessed by thermal analysis and, specifically, with differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) which alloy observation of the main thermal transitions of PLA and its plasticized
formulations (Figure 8A). At room temperature, PLA is stiff polymer characterized by
glass transition temperature, Tg, of 55 – 60 ºC.70 Regarding esters of raw lignin with
caprylic acid (PLA-xL-CA), they exert some plasticization on PLA as can be seen by a
reduction in Tg to values of 51.7 ºC, and 47.2 ºC for 10 wt.%, and 20 wt.%, respectively
(Table S3). The results obtained with the esters of waste lignin resulting from
fragmentation (WL) are different, depending on the fatty acid used for esterification.
WL esterified with oleic acid, shows a clear plasticization effect that can be assessed by
a decrease of Tg to values comprised in the 49 – 52 ºC, and a noticeable decrease in the
peak maximum of the cold crystallization process to such low values of 84 – 88 ºC, thus
suggesting better plasticization efficiency than esters of raw lignin (L). Interestingly,
esters of waste lignin with caprylic acid show a different behavior. At 10 wt.% (PLA10WL-CA), the Tg is not decreased, but a slight increase can be seen. Nevertheless, at 20
wt.% (PLA-20WL-CA), the decrease in Tg is similar to that observed for the other ligninbased esters. Anyway, this decrease in Tg is comparable, or higher, to that observed with
some commonly used modified vegetable oils as shown, with epoxidized palm oil (EPO)
71 or maleinized linseed oil (MLO). 72 By considering the theoretical enthalpy of a 100%
crystalline PLA to be 93.6 J/g 73, the degree of crystallinity (c) developed by all the
materials after processing by extrusion and injection moulding, , and the maximum
crystallinity these materials can reach, (c_max), is also provided in Table S2). Plasticizers
based on waste lignin fragmentation, lead to higher c, and c_max values. This
phenomenon suggests the increased chain mobility provided by the plasticizers have a
positive effect on both the c_max ranging from 52 – 56%, as well as on c with values of
32.6% for PLA-20WL-OA.

wt.%) of the different lignin-based esters, the improvement in ductile properties is
almost negligible. Nevertheless, DSC results have shown a decrease in Tg in almost all
lignin-based esters thus confirming plasticization, which is in fact reflected in a clear
decrease in maximum tensile strength at a concentration of 10 wt.% lignin-based esters
and is much more pronounced for plasticized PLA formulations containing 20 wt.%
lignin-based esters. Moreover, at 20 wt.% lignin-based esters, the plasticization effect is
not only detectable by a decrease in max, but also by a noticeable increase in b. Best
results were obtained with PLA-20WL-OA, showing the highest elongation at break of
46.1% (Figure 8-b). Despite these values are far from some of the best plasticizers
recently reported in this research area54, 74, 75, it is worthy to note they are similar, or
even higher to those reported in plasticized PLA with vegetable oil-derived
plasticizers.76, 77, 78, 79
The impact strength of neat PLA is 2.1 kJ/m2. This increases up to values of 6.4
kJ/m2, and 5.2 kJ/m2 for PLA-20WL-OA, and PLA-20WL-CA, respectively, thus showing a
noticeable increase in the ability of the plasticized formulations to absorb energy. The

increase in toughness has also been evaluated by calculating the work of fracture as the
area under the stress () – strain () curves. Neat PLA shows a low value of 5.9 MJ/m3,
consistent with literature reports, 80, 81 and is increased up to 11.7 MJ/m3 for PLA-20WLOA, thus showing the exceptional effect of these lignin-based esters on reducing PLA
brittleness. These results suggest waste lignin fragmentation esters with oleic acid, show
the best performance as biobased plasticizers for improved PLA toughness. Accordingly,
PLA-20WL-OA is the only formulation showing a noticeable decrease in the Shore D with
a value of 72.3 while all other materials in this work show a Shore D hardness of 80-83.
Figure 8-c gathers the optical images of the tensile specimens before and after the
uniaxial tensile test. As it can be seen, PLA is rather brittle, with very low elongation at
break; nevertheless, plasticized PLA with waste lignin fragmentation esters with oleic
acid (PLA-10WL-OA, and PLA-20WL-OA), show an increment in ductile properties with
clear evidence of plastic deformation.
These materials also show an exceptional shape memory behavior. They can be
deformed to a temporary shape at room temperature, due to the toughness these
plasticizers provide to brittle PLA. After plastic deformation, the materials retain the
deformed shape and when heated above their characteristic glass transition, they
recover the initial shape as can be seen in Supplementary Information.
Conclusions.
A photochemical process for lignin valorization based on anthraquinone moiety
has been successfully developed. The photocatalytic system is able to operate in batch
and flow conditions thanks to an immobilization of the sensitizer on silica particles.
Different samples of lignin derived from beech, pine and bamboo have been submitted
to this protocol, yielding industrially relevant monomers, such as vanillin and a mixture
of oligomer waste that has been employed as polylactic acid plasticizer after a simple
sterification with fatty acids. Addition of 20 wt.% esters of waste lignin with oleic acids
leads to a noticeable decrease in the glass transition temperature (Tg), which is reflected
in improved ductility and toughness. Additionally, these materials show a withstanding
shape memory behavior which can be very useful in self-repair PLA-based structures.
Therefore, a holistic lignin valorization method has been developed, in which no ligninderived residue is wasted.
