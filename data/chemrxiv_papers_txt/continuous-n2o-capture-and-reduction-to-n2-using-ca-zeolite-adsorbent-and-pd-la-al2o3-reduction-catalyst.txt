Abstract

There is an urgent need to develop effective methods for converting nitrous oxide (N2O) into nonharmful N2 because N2O is a potent greenhouse gas, and its increasing concentration in the
atmosphere is a major concern for global warming. In this study, we developed a two-step N2O
capture and reduction system, employing CaO-incorporated zeolites (Ca-zeolites) as N2O adsorbents
and Pd nanoparticles on La-containing Al2O3 (Pd/La/Al2O3) as catalysts for N2O reduction. This
process is suitable for continuous operation over a temperature swing of 50–150 °C. The N2O capture
capacity and subsequent reduction ability were preserved for at least 15 h (10 cycles). Notably, this
system can operate at low temperatures (below 150 °C) using a simple temperature-swing process
in the presence of O2.

Introduction
It is well known that N2O has a global warming potential approximately 300 times greater than that of
CO2 on a per-mass basis. Additionally, N2O is a significant contributor to stratospheric ozone
depletion.[1–3] Emissions of N2O from industries that use fossil fuels, burn biomass, and chemical
plants that produce nitric and adipic acids are increasing annually.[4] Without global mitigation efforts,
N2O emissions are expected to nearly double by 2050.[5] Consequently, effective catalytic posttreatment technologies must be developed to treat the N2O emissions from stationary systems and
vehicles burning transportation fuels.
Various methods exist for decomposing N2O into harmless N2, such as thermal,
electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic systems.[6–12] Although electrocatalytic and photocatalytic systems
can operate at ambient temperatures, their catalytic activities are reduced in the presence of O2.
Processes based on thermal catalysis can decompose N2O even in the presence of O2 through direct
decomposition (2N2O = 2N2 + O2)[13–21] or selective catalytic reduction[22–28] methods but both of these
require high temperatures, typically above 300 °C. Therefore, it is essential to devise methods that
can efficiently decompose N2O even in the presence of O2, especially at low temperatures.
In recent years, chemical looping has been increasingly recognized as an effective technique
for various chemical transformations, particularly those associated with CO2 utilization.[29,30] For
instance, a chemical-looping system for CO2 utilization employs CO2 adsorbents and CO2 reduction
materials that can operate in various reactors.[31–33] This process can be used for CO2 transformation
in the presence of O2 because the chemical absorption of CO2 is not inhibited by O2, and H2 as a
reductant is not simultaneously introduced into the same reactor as O2. This is advantageous from a
practical viewpoint because O2 is often present in waste gases containing CO2.
In this study, inspired by the aforementioned chemical-looping strategy, we developed an N2O
capture and reduction system that uses CaO-incorporated zeolites (Ca-zeolites) as N2O adsorbents
and Pd nanoparticles on La-containing Al2O3 (Pd/La/Al2O3) as the reduction catalyst. This new
process is suitable for continuous operation under temperature-swing cycling between 50 and 150 °C.
The N2O capture capacity and subsequent reduction ability were maintained for at least 15 h (10
cycles). Notably, this process can be performed at low temperatures (below 150 °C) via a simple
temperature-swing operation in the presence of O2.

Catalyst properties
Figure 1 shows the N2O-TPD profiles of various ion-exchanged zeolite materials. The desorption
amount of N2O in the temperature range of 50–250 °C was used to compare the adsorption capacity
of N2O. The obtained results show that the ion-exchanged Ca-MOR zeolite exhibited the highest N2O
adsorption capacity at 50 °C compared with the other samples prepared in this study. In addition, Ca-

MORSi/Al=110 and Ca-MFISi/Al=90, which were prepared by ion-exchange method using zeolites with high
Si/Al ratios, exhibit negligible N2O adsorption at 50 °C, indicating that the amount of Al sites in the
zeolite plays an important role in N2O adsorption. Figure 2 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the Ca-exchanged MOR (Ca-MOR) and H-MOR samples. The XRD peaks observed for Ca-MOR are
identical to those of H-MOR, without the presence of peaks for Ca species, indicating that the Ca
species in Ca-MOR are well dispersed.

A computational investigation was conducted to clarify the possible structures of the CaO

system stability under certain conditions by calculating the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) values.
Three types of MOR zeolites with different Al positions and sites were considered in this study: (i)

MOR with one Al atom, (ii) MOR with two Al in an 8-membered ring (8MR), and (iii) MOR with two Al
in a 5-membered ring (5MR), as shown in Figure S1.[34–37] The Al position in structure (VIII) is the
most stable and widely used. We also investigated the position of the second Al atom by fixing the
first atom and selecting structures (VII) and (II) as representative models with fairly stable structures
to investigate the 5MR and 8MR as possible Al sites (Figure S2). Subsequently, various Ca oxide
clusters with 1–3 Ca atoms were placed in each structure (Figure S3–S5). Only the most stable
structures for each chemical formulation are depicted for clarity. The valence state of Ca was set to
2+ for all structures because other valence states, such as 0 and +1, are unlikely under ambient
conditions. Figure 3 shows the phase diagram of the Ca oxide species with the lowest ΔG values as
a function of the temperature and partial pressure of O2. The results were obtained using VASP. Only
mononuclear and dinuclear Ca species were stable in all MOR models, whereas the trimeric species
were relatively unstable under these conditions.
The same ab initio thermodynamic analysis was performed using the computational results
calculated by Matlantis instead of Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)[38,39]. Matlantis
employs universal neural network potentials called PreFerred Potentials, which support various
elements and material types with an accuracy comparable to that of density-function theory (DFT)
calculations and with significantly lower computational costs.[40] If rational results can be obtained with
Matlantis, this would enable us to significantly reduce the computational time, even for unknown
systems. Figure S6 displays a phase diagram of the Ca species with the lowest ΔG values as a
function of the temperature and partial pressure of O2 obtained from the computational results
calculated by Matlantis. These results are similar to those obtained using VASP, confirming the high
reliability of Matlantis. The ab initio thermodynamic results indicate that mononuclear and dinuclear
species can be produced under the investigated experimental conditions, which is consistent with the
XRD results.

N2O adsorption/desorption and breakthrough results
The in situ infrared (IR) spectra of N2O adsorbed on Ca-MOR and H-MOR at 50 °C are shown in
Figure 4A. No adsorption peaks were observed for H-MOR, indicating that no N2O molecules were
adsorbed onto its surface. After Ca-MOR was exposed to N2O, two peaks at 2246 and 2273 cm-1
were observed, which are assigned to the N–N vibrational mode of N2O molecules adsorbed on Ca
sites.[41–43] These results indicate that the Ca species in Ca-MOR account for its superior N2O
adsorption capacity. Figure 4A also shows the in situ IR spectra of N2O adsorbed on Ca-MOR
collected under He with increasing temperature from 50 to 150 °C after exposure to 0.1% N2O/He for
30 min and subsequent purging under He. The intensity of the N2O molecules adsorbed on the Ca
species decreased with increasing temperature, and gaseous N2O was detected in the effluent of the
in situ IR cell, as shown in Figure 4B. A desorption peak of N2O was observed at ~90 °C with a
shoulder peak at ~125 °C, suggesting the presence of adsorbed N2O molecules with different
adsorption strengths.
Under practical conditions, O2, CO2, and H2O often coexist in N2O feed gas.[44,45] Therefore,
breakthrough experiments were performed to investigate the effects of O2, CO2, and H2O on the
adsorption capacity of N2O of Ca-MOR. The results of the breakthrough experiments (Figure 5) show
that the presence of O2 has almost no impact on the N2O capture ability of Ca-MOR, indicating that
Ca-MOR can selectively capture N2O in the presence of O2. However, the presence of 3% H2O
decreased the adsorption amount of N2O on Ca-MOR significantly. The Ca-MOR only exhibited
limited N2O adsorption capacity in the presence of 5% CO2. These results indicate that CO2 and H2O
should be removed from the N2O feed to ensure that Ca-MOR maintains high efficiency for N2O
capture.

of Ca-MOR: 100 mg, total flow rate = 50 mL/min, He balance.

Figure 6 shows the in situ IR spectra of N2O adsorbed on Ca/MOR after the introduction of
O2, CO2, or H2O. The spectra of N2O adsorbed on Ca-MOR were collected after the introduction of
0.1% N2O at 50 °C for 30 min. After the introduction of 10% O2 to the N2O feed gas, the absorbance
intensity of adsorbed N2O exhibited almost no change, indicating that the presence of O2 negligibly
affects the adsorption of N2O, which is consistent with the results of the breakthrough experiments.
After the introduction of CO2, the intensities of the peaks at 2273 and 2246 cm-1 decreased, and a
new peak appeared at 1377 cm-1 (Figure 6B). The peak at 1377 cm-1 was assigned to CO2 adsorbed
on Ca species in zeolite.[46] The peaks related to the adsorption of N2O onto Ca sites were not
observed after the introduction of 5% CO2 for 10 min. These results suggest that the presence of CO2
inhibited the adsorption of N2O because of the higher adsorption strength of CO2 on Ca than that of
N2O. A similar evolution of the peaks of adsorbed N2O was observed after the introduction of 3% H2O
(Figure 6C). After the introduction of 3% H2O, the peak intensity of adsorbed N2O decreased, and
the peak at 1625 cm-1 related to adsorbed H2O, increased.
We conducted a theoretical investigation of the adsorption energies of various adsorbates,
such as N2O, CO2, H2O, and O2 on the Ca-oxo clusters in MOR zeolite, which were identified by ab
initio thermodynamic analysis using VASP. Overall, we found that the adsorption of N2O was weaker
than that of CO2 or H2O but stronger than that of O2 (Figure S7). These results are in good agreement
with the findings of the in situ IR experiments.

N2O adsorption and reduction
Although N2O is considered a significant greenhouse gas, its removal from gas streams remains
challenging, especially at low temperatures and in the presence of O2, which is prevalent in various
N2O sources.[47] In this study, we developed a continuous N2O capture and reduction system in which
N2O could be selectively captured in the presence of O2 and reduced to N2 at relatively low
temperatures, as shown in Scheme 1. Two reactors containing Ca-MOR were set up in parallel for
the capture or release of N2O. The effluent composition for N2O capture was monitored by IR
spectroscopy. After feeding 500 ppm N2O + 10% O2 for 40 min, the N2O + O2 feed was switched to
the other reactor containing the same Ca-MOR material. The captured N2O was released by heating
the Ca-MOR to 150 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, and then cooling to 50 °C. The liberated N2O
was fed into the downstream section of the system, where the Pd/La/Al2O3 catalyst was positioned
and maintained at 150 °C throughout the process, along with a 4% H2 flow. The composition of the
effluent gas from the reactor equipped with Pd/La/Al2O3 was monitored using mass spectrometry.
Figure 7 shows the performance of the continuous N2O capture and reduction system. During
the heating of Ca-MOR from 50 to 150 °C, the formation of N2 was observed with a maximum
concentration of ~12000 ppm and almost no N2O was detected, indicating that all the N2O released
from Ca-MOR was efficiently reduced into N2 by H2 over Pd/La/Al2O3. In addition, no N2O was
detected using IR (data not shown), indicating that almost all of the supplied N2O was captured by
Ca-MOR. These results reveal that the N2O capture capacity and subsequent reduction ability of the
continuous N2O capture and reduction systems were preserved for at least 15 h (10 cycles) in the
presence of O2.

Conclusions
In this study, a series of alkali metal-exchanged zeolite samples were prepared, and their N2O capture
capacities were estimated. The obtained results demonstrate that Ca-MOR shows high efficiency for
N2O capture. Therefore, a continuous N2O capture and reduction system was developed using CaMOR as an N2O adsorbent and Pd/La/Al2O3 for N2O reduction. This process is suitable for continuous
operation under temperature-swing cycles between 50 and 150 °C, and the N2O capture and
subsequent reduction performance was preserved for at least 15 h (10 cycles). Notably, this process
can operate at low temperatures (below 150 °C) through a simple temperature-swing operation in the
presence of O2.

Experimental Section
Material preparation
Various zeolites were used to prepare the ion-exchanged zeolite materials: MOR (JRC-Z-HM20(5),
Si/Al = 9.1, Tosoh Co.), MFI (HSZ-820NHA, Si/Al = 11.15, Tosoh Co.), CHA (Si/Al ratio = 11.15,
Tosoh Co.), BEA (HSZ-920NHA, Si/Al = 8.75, Tosoh Co.), Y (HSZ-372HUA, Si/Al = 15, Tosoh Co.).
The following compounds were used for zeolite ion exchange: Mg(NO3)2 (>99.2%, Kanto Chemical
Co. Inc.), Ca(NO3)2 (>98.5%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), Sr(NO3)2 (>98.0%, Kanto Chemical
Co. Inc.), Ba(NO3)2 (>99.0%; Wako Pure Chemical Industries), Ce(NO3)3 (>98.0%; Wako Pure
Chemical Industries). For ion exchange, 1 g of zeolite powder was mixed with 50 mL of an aqueous
solution of the precursor in which the molar amount of the precursor was five times that of Al in the
zeolite. The slurry was then heated at 60 °C for 4 h under strirring. The as-prepared sample was
recovered by centrifugation at 4000 rpm, dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 500 °C for 3 h
to obtain ion-exchanged zeolite materials. The La-containing Al2O3-supported Pd catalyst
(Pd/La/Al2O3) was prepared using the impregnation method described in our previous paper.[48]

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku MiniFlex II/AP diffractometer with CuKα radiation. The quantity of the incorporated metal species was determined using energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDX-700HS, Shimadzu).
In situ infrared (IR) spectra were collected in transmission mode using an FT/IR-4600 (JASCO)
unit with a TGS detector. A self-supporting disk of the sample (40 mg) was placed in a handmade in
situ glass cell with CaF2 windows. For in situ IR experiments, N2O was fed into the cell at 50 °C
through a conventional flow reaction system at a total flow rate of 100 mL/min. Before the
measurements, the catalysts were pretreated in situ under He flow at 500 °C for 30 min. Temperatureprogrammed desorption of N2O (N2O-TPD) was performed using a BELCAT II instrument
(MicrotracBEL). After the He pretreatmentat 500 °C for 30 min, the sample was exposed to 10%

N2O/He (20 mL/min) at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by purging with He for 10 min. The sample was
heated to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.

Breakthrough experiments
Breakthrough experiments were performed with a feed of 500 ppm N2O, 500 ppm N2O + 5% CO2, or
500 ppm N2O + 3% H2O at a total flow rate of 50 mL/min. Before the breakthrough experiment, the
sample was pretreated under He flow (50 mL/min) at 500 °C for 30 min. The effluent gas stream was
monitored using an online FT-IR spectrometer (JASCO FT/IR-4600) with a TGS detector (20 scans
with a resolution of 4 cm-1) and a custom-built gas cell (CaF2 windows).

N2O capture and reduction
N2O capture and reduction experiments were performed using a continuously separated fixed-bed
flow system (Scheme 1). Two reactors containing 300 mg of Ca-MOR zeolite were set in parallel,
where one reactor captured the N2O selectively from the mixture of 0.1% N2O and 10% O2 (50 mL/min,
He balance), and the other released N2O by heating the Ca-MOR zeolite from 50 to 150 °C (20 °C/min)
under a flow of 4% H2/He (50 mL/min). The effluent from the N2O capture reactor was monitored using
an online FT-IR spectrometer (JASCO FT/IR-4600) equipped with a TGS detector (20 scans at a
resolution of 4 cm-1). The released N2O was then fed into a Pd/La/Al2O3 catalyst for the reduction of
N2O at 150 °C. The effluent of Pd/La/Al2O3 was monitored using a mass spectrometer (MS) apparatus
(BELMass, MicrotracBEL Corp).

Computational methods
Periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP,
version 5.4.4)[38,39] and Matlantis.[40] For VASP, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional revised for
solids (PBEsol)[49] was employed in combination with the projector-augmented wave (PAW)
method.[50] A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for plane-wave basis sets. Gaussian smearing
(width: 0.2 eV) was applied to occupy the electronic level. The k-point mesh included only the gamma
point of the Brillouin zone (1 × 1 × 1). The van der Waals interactions are described using a dispersioncorrected DFT-D3 (BJ) function.[51] The convergence of the force on each atom was set to 0.03 eV Å. The adsorption energy (Eads) of a molecule is defined as:

1

Eads = EA/S – EA – ES

(1)

where EA/S, EA, and ES are the electronic energies of the adsorption complex, free-state adsorbate,

Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm with a force threshold of 0.01 eV Å-1.

Ab initio thermodynamic analyses
Ab initio thermodynamic analysis[52,53] was performed to investigate the effects of the reaction gases
(O2 and H2O) and temperature on the calcium oxide species in the alumina-loaded zeolites. The
enthalpy and entropy at each temperature and standard state pressure (1 atm) were obtained from
the NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables.[54] The energies of the gas molecules were obtained using
a large empty unit cell (25 Å × 25 Å × 25 Å) to mimic the isolated species. The equilibrium reaction,
energy change (ΔE), Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), and chemical potential change (Δμ) under O2
and H2O atmospheres are given by Eqs. (2)–(5), respectively.

FULL PAPER
A two-step system for capturing and
reducing N2O has been developed,
utilizing CaO-incorporated zeolites
(Ca-zeolites) as an N2O adsorbent
and Pd nanoparticles supported on
La-containing Al2O3 (Pd/La/Al2O3) as
a reduction catalyst. This process is
designed for continuous operation
within a temperature range of 50–150
°C. The N2 O capture capacity and
subsequent reduction ability of the
system was maintained for at least 15
h (10 cycles). Notably, this process
can operate at low temperatures
(below 150 °C) via a simple
temperature-swing process in the
presence of O2.
