Abstract
Understanding the role of pH and ions on the electrical double layer (EDL) structure of charged
mineral oxide/aqueous interfaces remains crucial in modeling various environmental and industrial
processes. Yet the simultaneous contribution of pH and specific ion effects (SIEs) on the different
layers of the EDL remains unknown. Here, we utilize zeta potential (𝜁) measurements, vibrational
sum frequency generation (vSFG), and the maximum entropy method (MEM) to ascertain the
detailed structure of water in the Stern and diffuse regions of the EDL at the silica/water interface
under varying pH conditions for different alkali chlorides. Both at pH 2, when the surface is nearly
neutral, and at pH 12, when the surface is highly charged, we observe that the Li+ and Na+ disrupt
existing water structures within the Stern layer while Cs+ enhances them. Moreover, the SIE trends
for the diffuse and Stern layers are opposite with respect to one another at pH 2 (in the amount of
ordered water) and at pH 12 (in amount of net oriented water). Finally, we observe pH-dependent
SIE in 𝜁, which results in Cs+ exhibiting the least ordered diffuse layer at low pH and the most at
high pH. These results indicate that SIEs play critical yet separable roles in governing both the
electrostatic and water structuring capabilities in the EDL at charged surface.

Introduction
The dynamics and structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) formed at the charged
silica/aqueous interface have gained considerable attention due to their significance in
understanding various biological, technological, and environmental phenomena.[1–3] The EDL is
most commonly described by a Stern layer of fixed ions near the solid surface and a diffuse layer
of mobile ions based on mean-field theories established by Helmholtz, Guoy-Chapman, Stern and
Grahame.[4–8] However, these models fall short at providing a molecular picture of the structure
and arrangement of dominant chemical species like water as well as an underlying mechanism of
molecular interactions at charged aqueous interfaces. Furthermore, these models often assume
trends in specific ion effects for a given solid; in other words for a given ion the capacitance or
Stern layer thickness is generally considered to be independent of pH [9] or ion concentration.[10–
12]

Given the importance of cations in interfacial processes such as adsorption and desorption,[13–

15]

environmental transport,[16,17] mineral dissolution,[18,19] and surface charge development[20–22]

more accurate EDL models and molecular descriptions are needed to be able to predict many
environmentally relevant phenomena.

Over the past two decades, techniques such as AFM,[23–26] X-ray spectroscopies,[9,27–29]
electrokinetic measurements,[30–32] nonlinear optics,[32–42] and MD-DFT simulations[43–48] have
been used to decipher the EDL structure at charged aqueous interfaces under varying physical
conditions like pH[34,36], ion concentration,[49] and temperature.[50] Among these techniques,
vibrational sum frequency generation (vSFG) has become a leading tool for probing the EDL
structure due to its sensitivity to the noncentrosymmetric organization of molecular species at
buried interfaces.[39] By measuring the vibrational resonance of water molecules, vSFG is able to
provide information about the hydrogen bonding network at charged interfaces. Accordingly, it
has been utilized by our group and others to determine how the EDL structure changes depending
on the identity of the cation in the aqueous phase.[36,51,52] Yet one limitation of the more common
vSFG intensity measurements is difficulty in separating the contributions from the Stern and
diffuse layers to the total vSFG EDL spectrum. This difficulty arises as the SF intensity is related
to the square modulus of the second order nonlinear susceptibility that provides molecular
information about the interface, |𝜒 (") |" , making it challenging to deconvolute the different
contributions to the total 𝜒 (") response.
To overcome this challenge, our group has utilized vSFG, electrokinetic measurements, and
the maximum entropy method (MEM) with reference phase-sensitive vSFG and heterodyned
second harmonic generation (HD-SHG) data to determine the complex spectra of 𝜒 (") and
deconvolute the various spectral components of the EDL.[53–55] This approach has revealed that the
Stern layer at the silica/water interface is made up of different water populations whose net
orientation and extent of ordering is sensitive to ion concentration[53] and pH dependent.[54] In
contrast the diffuse layer exhibits no net reorientation upon changing the salt or pH from pH 2 to
12.[54,55] A recent heterodyned SFG study yielded a similar molecular interpretation of the pH-

dependent evolution of the EDL indicating that our MEM-based analysis was accurately capturing
the interfacial structure.[56]
While efforts to separate the different regions of the EDL are more recent, researchers have
long been interested in the role of ion identity on the overall interfacial structure.[20,57–59] At the
silica interface, previous vSFG studies focused on the entire EDL have revealed that identity of
the alkali ion does affect the EDL structure[37] and that the effects are highly dependent on pH.[36]
However, the combined effect of ion identity and pH on the structure of the Stern layer adjacent
to the solid has not been determined. Recently, Hunger et al.[60] performed phase-sensitive SFG
accompanied by MD-DFT simulations and concluded that specific ion effects observed near
neutral pH at high salt concentrations (1 M) in the vSFG complex spectra of the EDL arose
primarily from the Stern layer. The authors argued that under these conditions the surface electric
field is restricted to the structure of the silica and independent of the electrolyte, while the
individual fields coming from the ions and the water are ion-specific and compensate each other
rendering the total electric field invariant to the nature of the ion.[60] However, ion-specific
differences have been observed in surface potentials,[11] zeta potentials (𝜁),[61] and surface force[62]
measurements, albeit at lower salt concentrations, suggesting that the diffuse layer structure, which
is dominated by electrostatic interactions should be influenced by the specific ion. Moreover, this
study conducted at one pH did not reveal the pH evolution of the Stern layer, which has been found
to vary significantly for silica in the presence of sodium ions.[54,55]
In this work we have separated the response of the Stern layer and diffuse layer to identify
their respective pH-dependent specific ion effects using our combined experimental approach with
MEM analysis. Firstly, we found 𝜁 exhibited an inversion in ion specific trend at lower versus
higher pH in the presence of alkali chlorides. Such pH-dependent specific ion effects had not been

previously reported using electrokinetic measurements despite the abundance of specific ion
measurements on colloids.[31,61] Secondly, using our deconvolution approach, we determined that
the cation identity separately impacts the water structure in the diffuse and the Stern layers.
Specifically, near the point of zero charge (pH 2) we observed opposite trends in the amount of
net ordered water for the Stern and diffuse layers. Finally, as the pH was increased, the specific
ion trend in the diffuse layer structure inverted based on the pH-dependence of 𝜁. In contrast,
within the Stern layer at both low and high pH, we observed that the more chaotropic Cs+ leads to
greater net ordering of water than Na+ and Li+. In particularly. Cs+ promotes hydrogen bonding
between water layers at the interface more so than the kosmotropic Na+ and Li+. These results
suggest that both regions of the EDL are highly sensitive to ion identity and pH yet are decoupled
from one another allowing for opposite trends, highlighting the importance of introducing
molecular insight into empirical mean field models of the EDL.

Results and Discussion
Measuring the pH-dependent SIE for vSFG and 𝜁
Sum frequency generation reports on the noncentrosymmetric molecular structure afforded by
the charged interface. [63] In our experiments, SFG was achieved by the spatial and temporal
overlap of a narrow visible and broad IR pulsed laser light fields at the interface of the silica
substrate and the aqueous medium (Figure 1). The IR light was tuned to be in resonance with the
vibrational modes of water molecules at the interface within the O-H stretching region allowing
us to measure the net orientation and hydrogen-bonded structure of the interfacial water layer.[63]

which we can measure by streaming current.

part to interfacial water with a stronger and weaker hydrogen bonding network, respectively, while
the small peak at 3650 cm-1 is attributed to isolated silanol groups[65] or water experiencing a
hydrophobic environment.[66] A Fermi-resonance from the overtone of the water bend also
contributes in the 3200 cm-1 range.[55,67] For all three of the alkali chloride solutions, the highest
intensity was observed at pH 12 (Figure S1), which is consistent with the increased magnitude of
the surface charge density at this pH[20,49] and in turn the more negative outer Helmholtz potential
due to deprotonation of silanols. Furthermore, at pH 2 the intensity was slightly increased relative
to ~pH 6 despite the lower surface charge density expected at pH 2 (near the point of zero charge)
(Figure 1 vs S1, respectively). In previous work for the aqueous Na+/silica interface, an increase
in SF intensity at pH 2 was attributed to a flip in the orientation of water molecules in the Stern
layer upon decreasing the pH from pH 2 to neutral pH.[34,38]
Next, we measured 𝜁 using streaming current measurements on planar silica (Figure 1). We
observed that under neutral and acidic conditions the Cs+ exhibits the lowest magnitude 𝜁
compared to Na+ and Li+ but the trend inverts at higher pH. This pH dependence in the specific
ion effects of 𝜁 by electrokinetic measurements has not been previously reported, but it is
consistent with surface force measurements at the silica aqueous alkali chloride interface near
neutral pH and pH 9 where an inversion in trend was also observed for the determined FOHP.[62]
These vSFG and streaming current results support that specific ion effects in both 𝜁 and total EDL
structure are highly pH dependent. Yet how the pH dependence of the specific ion trends manifests
in the separate regions of the EDL (the Stern layer and the diffuse layer) is unclear. To address

this, we require knowledge of the complex spectra 𝜒'(')* from the overall intensity to properly
deconvolute the Stern and diffuse layers contributions (equation 1).[53,64,68]

To do this, we employed the maximum entropy method (MEM)[69,70] to determine the
magnitude of the SF response and the relative phase of the different oscillators (water molecules)
in our spectrum. Additionally, in our analysis we need the error phase, the phase offset between
the relative MEM phase and the absolute phase. Our previous work has shown that the pHdependence of the error phase can be predicted from heterodyned second harmonic generation
(HD-SHG), a complementary nonlinear measurement.[53,55] Recent work examining specific ion
effects in HD-SHG experiments did not observe statistically significant differences in the HD-

for each 50 mM alkali solution for a given pH. Using the previously reported error phase spectra

feature at 3000 cm-1 became positive and blue-shifted with increasing amplitude as the pH was
increased (Figure 2B and C). Additionally, the 3400 cm-1 mode increased in amplitude while
remaining positive with increasing pH. Finally, at 3600 cm-1 the amplitude transitioned from

significant specific ion effects that are also pH dependent. The minimum amplitude for the Stern
layer is observed at pH 6 while for the diffuse layer spectra it is observed at pH 2 (Figure 3B and

pH-Dependent Specific Ion Effects on Stern Layer Water Structure.
Previous work at the silica/water interface revealed that at higher pH, the water in the Stern
layer experienced a hydrogen-bonding environment that broke the C2v symmetry of the water, such
that each OH behaved as an individual oscillator.[55,73] At lower pH, this generally held true
although a bit of C2v character appeared in water near pH 2.[55] With this in mind, at neutral and
high pH the imaginary spectra of the Stern layer can be interpreted where the negative modes
represent decoupled OH oscillators of water with hydrogen atoms facing away from the surface
and positive modes being OH oscillators with H towards the surface. At pH 2, the situation is
(")

slightly altered where the sign of 𝐼𝑚𝜒$ reports on the direction of the dipole moment of the water
rather than the individual OH bonds. [54,71] We now consider the effect of specific ions on the Stern
layer water structure at acidic, near neutral, and basic conditions (Figure 3). Figure 4 highlights
the different water populations based on our peak assignments and the respective positions of the
cations at the different pH for Cs+ and Li+.

12 (C and F). The sum of the Stern and diffuse layers is equal to the total EDL (𝐼𝑚𝜒'(')* ) spectra
shown in Figure 2.
For the nearly neutral silica surface at pH 2 (Figure 3A), the spectra are consistent with water
molecules acting as a hydrogen acceptor from the silanols (positive mode at 3100 cm-1) as well as
a hydrogen bond donor to the silanol groups (negative mode at 3400 cm-1). The decrease in
amplitude of both modes follows the order Cs+> Li+» Na+ suggesting that the kosmotropic ions
(Li+, Na+) disrupt the exiting hydrogen bonding network at the surface. while the chaotropic ion
(Cs+) with small hydration shell promotes order in the interfacial water structure despite it being
closer to the interface (as previous studies have shown the Stern layer thickness is proportional to
the magnitude of 𝜁)[49] (Figure 4). Yet the positions of the various peaks do not shift irrespective
of the ion suggesting that the formation of the various H-bonded water environments is less
dependent on the ion identity as compared to the pH.

At near neutral pH (~pH 6) in the presence of 50 mM alkali chloride, the silica surface
becomes charged due to deprotonation of surface silanols resulting in significant changes to the
Stern layer structure. For all three alkali ions, upon increasing the pH from 2 to 6 we see a flip in
the orientation of the water molecules in the strong H-bond network and a gradual decrease in
amplitude of the weak H-bonded network (Figure 3B). We have attributed this net flip to the loss
of water acting as a hydrogen-bond acceptor to surface silanols and the increase in water acting as
a hydrogen bond donor to charged sites. This preference for orienting as a hydrogen-bond donor
stems from the attractive interactions that exists between the negative electric field from the
charged surface and the direction of the water dipole.[54]
For pH 12, the main feature is a positive peak at 3100 cm-1 attributed to water molecules
donating H-bond to the siloxide sites at the highly deprotonated surface (Figure 3C and Figure 4).
For each of the ions there seem to be very little disparity between the amplitude of the 3100 cm-1
peak although we see a red shift for Li+, indicating a stronger H-bond water network in its presence
but not a larger amount of ordering. This strengthened interaction is consistent with the concept of
matching water affinity[74] where the more hydrated ions like lithium interact strongly with the
strongly hydrated siloxide surface. Most striking, however, is the negative mode at 3500 cm-1,
which is much more pronounced for Cs+ than the kosmotropic ions. This mode has been attributed
to a water molecule acting as a hydrogen bond donor both to the surface and to the water layer
with the latter leading to the negative peak at 3500 cm-1 (Figure 4).[73] The fact that this mode is
much smaller for Li+ and Na+ supports previous MD-DFT and SFG lifetime measurements that
Na+ and Li+ promote in-plane H-bonding and minimize H-bonding between water layers.[46]
Moreover, spectral overlap between this negative peak at 3500 cm-1 and the positive peak at 3400
cm-1 arising from water donating a hydrogen to neutral silanol sites might explain why the Cs+

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8xcpf ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0007-6954-3598 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

exhibited a minimum in this region for the spectrum at pH 6. At pH 12, the silanol sites that
hydrogen bond with water are less abundant contributing less to the Stern layer spectrum allowing
this negative mode at 3500 cm-1 to appear (Figure 3B and C, respectively).

Figure 4. Illustration of the proposed molecular species that contribute to the Stern layer spectra
in the presence of Cs+ vs Li+. At low pH, the hydrogen-bonding environments are similar, but
water is more ordered by Cs+, which is expected to be closer to the surface. At high pH, we
propose that Cs+ switches its relative position from the surface and promotes hydrogen-bonding
along the surface normal between water layers (negative peak at 3500 cm-1).
Finally, the increased extent of hydrogen-bonding between adjacent water layers in the
presence of Cs+ vs Na+ and Li+ at pH 12 is consistent with the simulations of Yamakata et al who
observed that the density of water at the interface increases as hydrophobic ions approach a
negatively charged interface leading to an increase in the band intensity at 3400 cm-1.[75] Moreover,
it also helps explain the relative increase in 𝜁 magnitude observed for Cs+ at pH 12 as an increase
in density would lead to an increase in the relative permittivity,[76] which should lead to weaker
screening in the Stern layer.[49] Another explanation for the inversion in trend for 𝜁 at high pH is
Cs+ moving further away from the highly charged silica surface owing to weaker interactions with

water and a larger 𝜁 magnitude.

Specific Ion Effects on H-Bonding Networks, Oriented, and Ordered Water.

To relate the spectral changes in 𝐼𝑚𝜒,- and 𝐼𝑚𝜒+ to the extent of net ordering and net
orientation of water in the different regions of the EDL, we integrated the negative and positive
features in each spectrum. An approximation of the amount of net ordered water was determined
by adding the absolute values of the negative and positive peak areas, while the net orientation was
determined from the sum of the negative and positive peak areas. This analysis allows us to
distinguish between water that is highly ordered in specific hydrogen-bonding environments and
the net alignment of all water molecules.
Figure 5 exhibits the ion specific trends in the Stern layer compared to the diffuse layer as the
pH is varied. The net ordering of water in the Stern layer is generally more pronounced than in the
diffuse layer at low and neutral pH (Figure 5A). At pH 12, the electrostatically oriented diffuse
layer water becomes more significant such that it exhibits a similar extent of net ordering to that
in the Stern layer, which can be attributed to the higher surface charge density leading to a larger
outer Helmholtz potential. In contrast, the net orientation of water exhibits a clear pH-dependence
for both the Stern and diffuse layers (Figure 5B). At pH 2, near the point of zero charge, there is
pronounced ordering of strongly and weakly hydrogen-bonded water populations, but they exhibit
opposite orientation (Figure 5C). Accordingly, the net orientation of the Stern layer is small at this
pH while the net amount of order is large (Figure 5B and A, respectively).

ordered water and (B) the average amount of net oriented water. (C) SIE trends in the net
orientation of the Stern layer in terms of total water, the more strongly hydrogen-bonded (s H
bond) and more weakly hydrogen-bonded (w H bond) network. The values are the average of
integrating two separate SF replicates, and the error bar is the range of measured values.
Regarding specific ion effects, at pH 2 the amount of ordered water exhibits opposite SIEs in
the two layers of the EDL with Cs+ exhibiting the highest amount of ordered water in the Stern
layer and the least in the diffuse layer (Figure 5A). However, the net orientation of water in the
Stern layer and the diffuse layer exhibits the same SIE trend at pH 2: Cs+<Na+<Li+ (Figure 5B).
As mentioned, this difference in net ordering vs net orientation for the Stern layer arises from the
highly ordered but oppositely oriented strongly and weakly H-bonded species observed at pH 2
with Cs+ in particular, leading to a well oriented weak H-bond network (Figure 5C). At pH 6, when

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8xcpf ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0007-6954-3598 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

the strongly hydrogen-bonded population has flipped within the Stern layer, both the net
orientation and net ordering of water in the Stern layer are greater for Cs+ vs Li+ while the opposite
trend is again observed for the diffuse layer. If we look more closely at the Stern layer structure,
we see the most pronounced Hofmeister trends in amplitude for the strong rather than the weak Hbond network (Figure 5C). However, as mentioned this could arise from a negative population at
3400 cm-1 that is starting to emerge for Cs+ owing to hydrogen-bonding between water layers that
cancels the response from water acting as a hydrogen bond donor to neutral silanol sites.
Finally, at pH 12 we observe a flip in the SIE with Cs+ exhibiting the greatest amount of net
order in the diffuse layer based on the largest 𝜁 magnitude. Yet for all of the specific cations, a
similar extent of order in the Stern layer is observed (Figure 5A). In contrast, the net orientation
now reveals pronounced and opposite SIEs for the Stern and diffuse layers (Cs+<Li+ vs Li+<Cs+,
respectively). Similar to pH 2, we propose that the Cs+ promotes a highly ordered Stern layer at
this pH, but with water populations exhibiting opposite orientations leading to an overall decrease
in the net orientation compared with the other cations.
Altogether these results suggest that despite changes in ion affinity (based on the trends in 𝜁
potential) and surface hydration with increasing pH, Cs+ consistently leads to the most amount of
net ordering for the water in the Stern layer. However, the net orientation of water can exhibit
different trends owing to cancellation of different water populations that are opposite in
orientation. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the Stern layer and diffuse layers can exhibit
opposite trends in SIEs revealing that the structures are largely decoupled from one another. Such
decoupling of the Stern and diffuse layer has been observed in non-resonant SHG measurements
concerning the dynamics but not evaluated in terms of hydrogen-bonded structure.[78] This latter

understand SIEs at charged oxide aqueous interfaces.

Conclusions
We have studied the simultaneous contribution of specific ion effects and pH on the Stern and
diffuse layer water structure at the silica/water interface. Using a combination of complementary

maximum entropy method, we deconvoluted the Stern layer spectra 𝐼𝑚𝜒$ from the entire EDL
in the presence of Li+, Na+ and Cs+ chloride solutions. Near the point of zero charge (pH 2), the
Stern and diffuse layer show opposite trends with respect to the specific ions for the amount of
ordered water. The more hydrophobic Cs+ leads to greater water structuring in the Stern layer than
Na+ and Li+ but exhibits the lowest magnitude of zeta potential leading to less electrostatic ordering
manifested in the diffuse layer of the EDL. This trend in Cs+ promoting more order in the Stern
layer compared with Li+ with opposite effects on the diffuse layer is also exhibited near neutral
pH. Under basic conditions, however, the SIEs exhibit a dramatic reverse in trend in 𝜁 indicating
that Cs+ is pushed further away from the interface. Consistent with this observation, we observe
signatures in the Stern layer of water hydrogen-bonding between layers for Cs+ and not the other
cations. Decoupling the contributions of each of the specific ions to the pH-evolution of the Stern
and diffuse layers provides mechanistic understanding of reversal of Hofmeister trends at the
silica/water interface[62,79] as well as greater insight into changes in the Stern layer structure not
predicted by current models of the interface. Moreover, these pH dependent SIEs studies serves as
a starting point to expand our understanding of important industrial processes involving
