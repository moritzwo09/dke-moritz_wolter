Abstract

26

The origin of the bioaccumulative neurotoxin methylmercury (MeHg) in the ocean remains elusive. The

27

current paradigm suggests that microbial methylation of inorganic Hg within the oceanic water column

28

produces monomethylmercury (MMHg) and potentially dimethylmercury (DMHg). Reaction rates and

29

main drivers governing MeHg levels (sum of MMHg and DMHg) are poorly constrained. We conducted

30

ambient Hg species measurements and enriched isotopic tracer experiments in waters of two

31

contrasting marine environments, the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea (MED) and the mesotrophic

32

Atlantic Ocean (ATL). Maximum subsurface MeHg levels were ~2 times higher in the MED compared

33

to the ATL, essentially driven by higher DMHg concentrations (0.45 ± 0.06 vs 0.16 ± 0.02 pM).

34

Methylation was only detectable in unfiltered subsurface waters and presumably biotically driven. The

35

highest methylation rate (MMHg to DMHg) was observed in subsurface MED waters while reduction

36

and demethylation rates were highest in surface waters of both environments. Experimental reaction

37

rates and the potential microbial activity (based on 16S rDNA) aligned with ambient Hg species

38

distributions.

39

Assuming high DMHg stability and applying our fast experimental DMHg formation rates, a newly

40

developed 1D water column model (MED) successfully reproduced MeHg species distribution,

41

suggesting DMHg plays a key role in the global marine Hg cycle.

1. Introduction

43

Monomethylmercury (MMHg) is of global concern due to the capacity of this neurotoxin to biomagnify

44

across trophic levels [1]. The primary exposure pathway to MMHg for humans is the consumption of

45

marine fish [2]. The Minamata Convention aims to reduce human exposure to Hg, by reducing

46

anthropogenic Hg emissions, with substantial progress made since its ratification [3]. Mercury remains

47

of concern since anthropogenic activities have led to an approximately threefold increase of oceanic

48

surface Hg concentrations compared to pre-anthropogenic levels [4].

49

Once Hg has entered the ocean it can undergo a series of abiotic and biotic transformations (e.g.

50

methylation, demethylation, reduction, oxidation) [5]. The main Hg species found in the ocean are

51

monomethylmercury (MMHg), dimethyl Hg (DMHg), elemental Hg (Hg(0)), and inorganic mercuric Hg

52

(Hg(II))[6]. Due to analytical constraints operationally defined Hg species such as methylated mercury

53

(MeHg) as the sum of MMHg and DMHg and dissolved gaseous Hg (DGM) the sum of Hg(0) and DMHg

54

are commonly reported [7].

55

Despite considerable efforts, a lack of understanding persists on Hg transformation pathways likely

56

governing ambient Hg species concentrations. The limitations of our current understanding of MeHg

57

cycling in the ocean is exemplified by the limited reproducibility of MeHg observations in oceanic

58

waters by coupled biogeochemical models [8,9]. The prevailing scientific consensus agrees on biotic in

59

situ Hg methylation [10,11] as the major source of MeHg in oceanic waters, with its distribution often

60

closely linked to microbial organic matter degradation [12–14].

61

The importance of anaerobic microorganisms (e.g. sulfate-reducing bacteria, iron-reducing bacteria,

62

methanogenic archaea) in mediating methylation is well known in anoxic environments, with the

63

hgcAB genes encoding for Hg methylation [15]. Microbes thriving in oxic marine waters bear similar

64

Hg transformation genes but their importance in Hg methylation is still debated [16–18]. Incubation

65

experiments evidence the methylation of Hg(II) in oxic marine waters [10,11]. The cycling of DMHg in

66

seawater is less understood, but it appears to be connected to the formation and decomposition of

67

MMHg [10,19–22].

68

The mer operon, broadly distributed among prokaryotes [23–25], encodes for enzymes mediating

69

reduction (MerA) and demethylation (MerB). The presence and activity of the mer operon in the global

70

ocean, even under low ambient oceanic Hg(II) and MeHg concentrations, has been demonstrated for

71

Alteromonadales (merA, merB), Rhodobacterales (merA), Flavobacteriales (merA, merB), and

72

Sphingobacteriales (merB) among others [26,27].

73

The main objective of this study was to investigate potential Hg species reaction rates and drivers. We

74

selected two contrasted marine environments with different productivity and Hg species distribution,

75

I) offshore, oligotrophic waters of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (MED) and II) coastal,

76

mesotrophic waters of the Bay of Biscay, northeastern Atlantic Ocean (ATL). We conducted sampling

77

campaigns during spring bloom in the MED in May 2021 and in the ATL in May 2022. We measured

78

ambient Hg species concentrations (THg, MMHg, DMHg, DGM) along vertical profiles, conducted

79

enriched isotope tracer incubation experiments and microbial diversity analysis (16S rDNA sequencing)

80

at biogeochemically relevant depths. We use the determined rate constants and reaction pathways in

81

a 1D water column model set-up to test the plausibility of our rates.

2. Material & Methods
2.1. Study Sites

84

Sampling was conducted on the 4th of May 2021 (MED station; 43° 0’ 16.128” N, 5° 25’ 21.792” E, 1500

85

m), northwestern Mediterranean Sea onboard the research vessel Antédon II, shortly after a wind

86

driven upwelling event (1st to 3rd May) [28]. For the North Atlantic (ATL) station sampling was

87

conducted on the 10th of May 2022 in the southeastern Bay of Biscay (ATL station; 43° 35’ 43.8” N, 1°

88

47’ 42.6012” W, 760 m) in onboard the research vessel Côte de la Manche. The MED station is an

89

oligotrophic off-shore station , with no major riverine influence nearby [29], while the ATL station is a

90

mesotrophic station under the influence of the Adour River [30]. A description of the two study areas

2.2. Water Sampling and Sample Handling

108

Samples were obtained from acid cleaned (1 % HCl) 10 L GOFLO (General Oceanics) bottles mounted

109

to an epoxy-painted trace metal clean carousel, following ultra-trace metal clean protocols [32].

110

Sampling bottles were thoroughly rinsed with the corresponding water without filtration and filled

111

without head-space. Samples for total Hg (THg) (MED, ATL) were sampled into 60 mL FEP bottles

112

(Nalgene) and kept at +4°C until analysis. For the ATL, DGM was sampled into 500 mL FEP/PFA bottles

113

(Nalgene), purged onto gold coated sand traps (Au-traps) and stored at -20°C until analysis. For the

114

MED, DGM was sampled into 125 mL PET bottles (VWR) and kept at +4°C until analysis. DMHg (MED,

115

ATL) was sampled into 500 mL FEP/PFA bottles (Nalgene), directly purged onto graphitized carbon

116

(Carbotraps) and kept at -20°C until analysis. The DMHg-purged sample was acidified to 0.5% (v/v) with

117

HCl (OptimaTM) for MMHg analysis and an unpurged sample was acidified in the same way for MeHg

118

analysis [33] and stored dark in double zip closed bags at +4°C until analysis.

119

For the ATL, seawater for incubation experiments was sampled at the surface (SML), Chlorophyll

120

maximum (DCM), Oxygen minimum (min O2), deep water (DW) (Figure 2) and filled into 1 L FEP/PFA

121

bottles (Nalgene), or 5 L PE containers. Dedicated samples were filtered using an acid cleaned filtration

122

tower (Nalgene) with acid cleaned 0.2 µm PP (Pall) or 0.22 µm PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore).

123

The respective sampling bottles containing seawater for incubations were then stored in double zip

124

closed bags, dark at +4°C until the start of the experiments the following day.

125

Filters to investigate the bacterial community composition (16S rDNA) were sampled in replicates by

126

the filtration of 1 L of seawater onto a PP 0.2 µm membrane (MED; Pall) or sterile 0.2 µm cellulose

127

acetate filter (ATL; Sartorius, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored in sterile cryotubes at -80°C until

128

extraction.

129

2.1. Determination of Ambient Hg Species

130

Measurements were conducted following established protocols, all reagents were prepared with

131

ultrapure water obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm) using analytical grade

132

reagents. THg was analyzed following a modified USEPA method 1631 by Bromine monochloride (BrCl)

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7ps10 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0007-1234-8740 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

133

oxidation, stannous chloride (SnCl2) reduction purge and trap followed by cold vapor atomic

134

fluorescence spectrometry (CV-AFS, Brooks Rand, Model 3) the day after sampling [34]. For the MED,

135

DGM samples were analyzed the day after sampling on the same instrument without oxidation and

136

reduction and a higher sample volume (~125 mL), as previously described elsewhere [35]. For the ATL,

137

DGM samples were analyzed by double amalgamation on gold-CV-AFS [36,37] within 10 days of

138

sampling, DMHg was analyzed by cryogenic trapping GC-ICPMS [33,38] within 30 days of sampling.

139

MeHg and MMHg were analyzed by species-specific isotope dilution analysis followed by GC-ICPMS

140

[33,39] within 30 days of sampling.

141

2.2. Incubation Experiments

142

All incubations were conducted in triplicates, following an established protocol [40]. Briefly, samples

143

were amended to ~10 pM of 199Hg(II) and ~1 pM of MM201Hg and incubated the day after sampling

144

under natural light or dark conditions in water baths on the rooftop of MIO (MED; Mediterranean

145

Institute of Oceanography, Marseille) or on the lower deck on board the research vessel (ATL).

146

Additional experiments to follow the formation of DMHg were conducted for the MED under dark

147

conditions for DCM, min O2 and DW. For the ATL, the applied protocol allows to differentiate between

148

the formation of Me199Hg or MM199Hg from added 199Hg(II) [40]. All experiments were conducted on

149

unfiltered and filtered waters (0.2 µm), the latter considered as abiotic control, removing the majority

150

of particles and living cells [41–43]. Incubation samples (aqueous) were analyzed by GC-ICPMS applying

151

quadruple species-specific isotope dilution [20,21], and traps (Au-, carbo-) were analyzed by cryogenic

152

trapping GC-ICPMS [22].

153

Reaction rates were calculated assuming pseudo-first order reaction kinetics from a two-point

154

(demethylation, methylation of Hg(II)) or a one point incubations (reduction, reductive demethylation,

155

methylation

156

ln(MM201Hg/MM201Hgt0), all other rates constants were calculated assuming a linear increase of the

157

reaction product (reduction, reductive demethylation, methylation of Hg(II) and MMHg). Additional

2.3. Ancillary Parameters

160

Temperature, Salinity, Oxygen and Fluorescence were measured in situ with a conductivity

161

temperature density (CTD) probe (Seabird SBE 911plus), equipped with an Oxygen Sensor (Seabird SBE

162

43), beam transmissometer (SeaBird Scientific C-Star) and fluorometer (Chelsea Aquatracka III). DNA

163

from in situ samples was extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according

164

to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -20°C. The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis through

165

MiSEQ was performed following established methods and details can be found in the SI.

166

2.4. Quality assessment and Quality control

167

Method detection limit for ambient THg was 30 fM based on 3 x SD of the blank signal, for DGM 5.5 fM

168

based on 3 x SD of purge blank measurements, for DMHg 0.38 fM based on the background equivalent

169

concentration (BEC), and for MeHg and MMHg 15 and 12 fM based on the BEC. Relative standard

170

deviation (RSD) for replicate samples for THg was usually better than 6 % at ~1 pM, and was

171

determined for DGM with 9.6 % at 0.09 pM (n = 3), for DMHg with 7 % at 0.11 pM (n = 3), for MeHg

172

with 4.7 % at 0.07 pM, and for MMHg with 7.9 % at 0.05 pM (n = 3). The RSD for each species was

173

similar or better than the established measurements uncertainty for THg [44], DGM [45], MMHg and

174

DMHg [33].

175

2.5. 1D Water column Model

176

We conducted a modeling exercise in order to test the feasibility of newly determined DMHg formation

177

rates (~6 times faster than in current models) in this study and their impact on ambient Hg species

178

distribution. To model the Hg speciation at the MED station, we use the GOTM-ECOSMO-MERCY

179

modeling system. We chose to model only the MED station, as lateral and bottom influences can be

180

considered to be of minor importance in contrast to the ATL station. GOTM is a hydrodynamic 1D

181

model that calculates the turbulence of a vertical water-column by solving the 1D transport equation

182

of momentum, salinity, and temperature. Thus, the model only has a vertical and no horizontal

183

resolution [46,47].

184

ECOSMO is an end to end ecosystem model including the 7 biological functional groups for

185

phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrobenthos, and fish [48]. MERCY is a Hg cycling model including

186

speciation of Hg(0), Hg(II) HgS, MMHg(I), and DMHg in water, sediment, and biota, the partitioning of

187

Hg(II) and MMHg(I) between the dissolved, particulate, and colloidal phases, and the air-sea exchange

188

of Hg(0) and DMHg [49]. Based on our hypothesis that DMHg formation is biotically mediated, we scale

189

our maximum DMHg formation rate determined to remineralization.

190

The coupled GOTM-ECOSMO-MERCY model was run for 20 years whereof the first 19 years were

191

discarded as spin-up period. For a detailed description of the GOTM model, the modeled Hg species,

192

and the reaction rates, please refer to the SI.

3. Results & Discussion
3.1. Biogeochemical Characteristics of the Two Study Sites

195

The MED station is representative for warm, oligotrophic waters, while the ATL station is

196

representative for mesotrophic waters. We observed higher salinity (S) and temperatures (T) in the

197

deepest sampled waters of the MED (800 m depth, S: 38.6, T: 13.4°C) compared to the ATL (750 m

198

depth, S: 35.7, T: 10.3°C). The ATL station also showed a moderate freshwater influence (S: 34.7) from

199

the Adour river extending down to ~79 m until reaching typical Atlantic salinity values (35.4). A relative

200

fluorescence maximum, indicating the DCM depth was observed with typical δ13C signatures of

201

phytoplankton for the respective environment [50] at both stations, at ~53 m for the MED (δ13C: 23.44

202

to 24.7 ‰) and ~43 m for the ATL (δ13C: 24.65 ‰).

203

At the MED station, oxygen decreased (~149 µmol kg-1) accompanied by a slight salinity increase to up

204

to 38.7 down to ~475 m indicative of Eastern Levantine Intermediate Waters forming a relative min O2

205

zone [51]. Below ~500 m oxygen concentrations increased until the deepest point of sampling (~800

206

m), representative of Western Mediterranean Deep Waters (Figure SI 2).

207

For the ATL, we observed a relative subsurface min O2 at ~104 m (~191 µmol kg-1) which coincided with

208

a decrease in beam transmission. Below this relative min O2, oxygen increased within the Eastern North

209

Atlantic Central Water, followed by a decrease in oxygen and beam transmission down to the bottom.

210

This decrease in oxygen could be due to the mixing with Mediterranean overflow waters below ~500 m

211

(Figure SI 2), or the influence of remineralization of remobilized particles, described for the Capbreton

212

Canyon [52,53].

213

3.2. Ambient Hg Species

214

Median THg concentrations were comparable between the two study stations, although more variable

215

at the MED with 0.64 pM (interquartile range (IQR) = 0.50 - 0.94 pM) than at the ATL with 0.66 pM (IQR

216

= 0.58 – 0.71 pM). The vertical profiles of THg differed between both stations (Figure 2). For the MED,

217

THg was depleted at the surface, potentially due intense atmospheric exchange, and continuously

218

increased with depth. At the ATL, THg peaked at the DCM depth (~1 pM) without showing a depletion

219

at the surface due to the input of Hg from the Adour River plume [30]. Despite that a decrease in beam

220

transmission below ~600 m possibly suggests a sediment influence, no clear impact on THg

221

concentrations was observed at the deepest sampling point for the ATL station (Figure 2D). Our

222

observations for the MED for THg are in the range of previous observations for the MED [12,29,51,54].

223

In contrast, our observations for the ATL for THg are lower than earlier observations reported at the

224

same station during a higher discharge event of the Adour river [30] but align with previous

225

observations for the North Atlantic, and the Iberian Abyssal Plain [29,55,56].

226

We observed an increase of MeHg with depth at both stations, while MMHg was uniformly distributed

227

along the profiles and remained low (<0.06 pM), at the MED (median = 0.037 pM, IQR = 0.031 – 0.040

228

pM) and ATL station (median = 0.034 pM, IQR = 0.026 – 0.039 pM). In contrast, DMHg increased with

229

depth, reaching concentrations at the MED roughly two times higher (0.45 ± 0.06 pM; maximum ±

230

measurement uncertainty (k = 2)) than at the ATL station (0.16 ± 0.02 pM; maximum ± measurement

231

uncertainty (k = 2)). DMHg always dominated the MeHg pool below ~200 m (Figure 2B, D; Figure SI 3),

232

thus MeHg variations were primarily driven by DMHg levels. Our observations for MMHg

233

concentration levels align with previous studies for the MED [29] and the eastern North Atlantic, which

234

reported similarly low MMHg concentrations (generally below 0.1 pM) [29,55]. DMHg concentrations

235

for both stations were higher [55,57] or within the range of literature values for the respective oceanic

236

basin [29]. The importance of DMHg within the MeHg pool has previously been suggested for the MED

237

[12,29,54,58], ATL [20,29] and other oceanic basins [20,59,60] although contrasting observations have

238

also been reported [55,57,61].

239

Similarly, the importance of DMHg within the DGM pool has been debated, in particular for the MED

240

[51]. Our observations were in the range of literature values [29,30,57,62]. DGM concentrations were

241

comparable between the MED (median = 0.27 pM; 0.05 – 0.37 pM) and the ATL station (median = 0.21

242

pM; IQR = 0.16 – 0.27 pM), although DMHg was more prominent within the DGM pool for the MED

243

(median = 75 %, IQR = 43 – 120 %) than the ATL station (median = 8 %, IQR = 2 – 38 %), overall indicating

244

that Hg(0) was of higher importance in ATL mesotrophic waters than in MED oligotrophic waters.

245

Based on our results, we suggest that DMHg is an important Hg species in particular within the MeHg

246

pool and is key for explaining the differences in observed ambient MeHg maxima and its proportion of

247

THg. This is supported by the consistently low MMHg concentrations in both environments, in contrast

248

to the higher and more variable DMHg levels that dominated the MeHg pool at depth.

3.3. Hg Species Transformations

257

We detected methylation of Hg(II) to MeHg and DMHg, as well as the conversion of MMHg to DMHg,

258

exclusively for unfiltered subsurface waters. We consider unfiltered water to be representative of in

259

situ conditions, including the presence of particles and living cells. These findings, combined with the

260

significance of bacterial activity in marine subsurface waters [63] suggest a particle-dependent, likely

261

biotically driven in situ methylation pathway. This aligns with the prevailing scientific consensus that

262

biotic in situ methylation predominantly governs MeHg in seawater [6,64].

263

We observed the highest potential methylation for the formation of DMHg from MMHg, at the MED

264

station within min O2 waters and DW (Figure 3A), followed by the formation of MeHg from Hg(II) in

265

DW at the ATL station (Figure 3D). Highest potential methylation coincided with the highest relative

266

abundance (>8 %) of potential hgcAB bearing phyla according to microbial community analysis (16S

267

rDNA) at both stations (Figure 3A, D). Dedicated experiments to investigate the formation of DMHg

268

from MMHg were conducted under dark conditions at the MED station (for DCM, min O2 and DW). For

269

experiments conducted at the ATL station we examined our purged incubation samples (MM199Hg, n

270

= 3) and compared them to unpurged samples (Me199Hg, n = 3), used to calculate methylation rates

271

from Hg(II) to MeHg. We found a significant difference (one tailed t-test, p <0.05) between Me199Hg

272

and MM199Hg in DW. In DW, MM199Hg accounted with ~10 % for the minor fraction of Me199Hg

273

suggesting the dominant formation of DMHg from Hg(II). In contrast to the methylation observed for

274

min O2 waters at the ATL station, where the absence of a significant difference suggests that

275

methylation to MM199Hg was predominant, although the importance of this pathway remains

276

uncertain since methylation levels were close to the detection limit.

277

The potential in situ formation of DMHg (min O2: MED; DW: MED, ATL) observed in incubation

278

experiments aligns with the depths where DMHg dominated the ambient MeHg pool (Figure 2C, F).

279

Our observed rate constants for the formation of MeHg (from Hg(II) and MMHg) are in agreement with

280

literature data for MeHg formation from Hg(II) (see Table SI 6). In contrast, our highest observed rate

281

constants of DMHg formation from MMHg, were ~3 times higher (see Table SI 8), than highest, species-

282

specific rate constants reported for polar marine waters [10].

283

Light-induced rates for Hg(II) reduction and MMHg demethylation were approximately one order of

284

magnitude faster than dark rates, consistent with previous observations [10,11,30,65,66]. The

285

reduction of Hg(II) was ubiquitous under natural light (Figure SI 5) and dark conditions(Figure 3C, F),

286

with consistently higher rates in the unfiltered samples. Lower rates in filtered samples (0.2 µm) thus

287

suggest a biotic contribution [67–71] whereas it remains unclear whether reduction was directly

288

mediated by microbial pathways or indirectly induced by biotic activities, e.g. through biogenic organic

289

compounds released by cells. In contrast, the light-dependent demethylation rates of MMHg were

290

relatively similar for unfiltered and filtered incubations (Figure SI 5). Dark demethylation of MMHg was

291

exclusively observed for unfiltered incubations, at similar rates at the DCM at both stations (Figure 3B,

292

E) and in DW only at the ATL station (Figure 3E).

293

Microbial community analysis, conducted on incubated water samples confirmed the presence

294

(>0.1 %, Figure 3) of Rhodobacterales (merA), Flavobacteriales (merA, merB) in all samples and

295

Sphingobacteriales (merB) only in surface waters (0.3 ± 0.05 %, n = 3) at both stations. In agreement

296

with the highest potential rate observed in incubation experiments for reduction and demethylation

297

in surface waters (SML, DCM), and lowest potential rate in deepest samples (DW). The highest relative

298

abundance of Rhodobacterales (merA) in the SML at ATL station (11.2 ± 0.2 %, n = 3) coincided with

299

the highest dark reduction rate observed in this study. Mer-independent reduction pathways, such as

300

the production of reactive oxygen species by heterotrophic bacteria [72,73], extracellular reduction

301

through superoxide formation [74], the use of Hg(II) as an electron acceptor by phototrophs [75,76],

302

and light-dependent processes previously linked to primary productivity [67,71,77], may also be of

303

relevance under our experimental conditions. Similarly, mer-independent demethylation pathways

304

may include intracellular mer- (see SI 6) and light-independent demethylation mediated by

305

phytoplankton, as demonstrated in laboratory experiments [78], and demethylation by sulfate

3.4. The Need to Separate MMHg and DMHg Dynamics

320

The origin of marine MeHg is still debated [82] and the underlying mechanisms governing ambient

321

MMHg and DMHg levels in marine oxygenated waters are not well understood. Methylation of Hg(II)

322

to MMHg, mediated by hgcAB bearing microorganisms, is known to occur under anaerobic conditions

323

[15,79,83]. Anoxic micro-niches within sinking particles, have been proposed as potential sites for Hg

324

(II) methylation [14,17] in marine oxygenated waters [84].

325

At the MED site, we observed the formation of DMHg from MMHg in both the min O2 and DW waters.

326

However, simultaneous methylation of Hg(II) to DMHg was only detected in DW, and was the slowest

327

methylation rate observed and below the DL for MeHg formed in aqueous samples (DL lower by

328

approximately one order of magnitude). Our observations at the MED site and the limited available

329

literature suggest a two-step mechanisms (Hg(II)→ MMHg→ DMHg) for the formation [10,19] as well

330

as the degradation of DMHg [21,22,60,85,86]. While our results indicate the crucial role of particles for

331

both methylation steps, different biotic or abiotic drivers (e.g. particle size distribution, organic

332

substrate, bacterial diversity and heterotrophic activity) may influence each individual step. It is also

333

possible that the two methylation steps may occur spatially or temporally independent of each other

334

or display distinct sensitivity/reactivity to/with oxygen [10,11,19]. In addition, methylation of Hg(II)

335

may also have occurred in deeper waters but at rates below our DL. We find that studying the dynamics

336

of MMHg and DMHg separately is essential for explaining MeHg maxima in marine oxygenated waters.

337

The importance of distinguishing MMHg and DMHg dynamics, is furthermore exemplified by the

338

discrepancy between MMHg demethylation and MeHg formation rates observed for DW at the ATL

339

station. In our experiments, MMHg demethylation rates were ~2 times higher than the formation of

340

MeHg from Hg(II), suggesting a net demethylation of MeHg. However, MeHg mainly present as DMHg

341

comprised ~26 % of ambient THg in DW, together with the preferential formation of DMHg from Hg(II)

342

in our experiments, point towards the crucial role of DMHg in the system. Published dark

343

demethylation rates (MMHg → Hg(II)) are ~23 times higher (median values, log-transformed) than

344

dark methylation rates (Hg(II) → MeHg) (Table SI 6 and SI 7). Literature data thus indicate a net

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7ps10 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0007-1234-8740 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

345

demethylation globally, which contrasts with the widespread presence of MeHg in the ocean [7].

346

Overall our observations and literature data suggest that a net methylation rate, based solely on the

347

MeHg formation (Hg(II) → MeHg (MMHg + DMHg)) and demethylation of MMHg (MMHg → Hg(II)),

348

does not fully resolve the biogeochemical MeHg cycle [20,21,59,87,88].

349
350

3.5. Water Column Model

351

Observations of in situ DMHg formation rates in oxygenated marine waters are scarce (Table SI 8), with

352

our observed maximum rates (MMHg → DMHg) being ~6 times higher than rates applied in current

353

biogeochemical models [8,9]. The important formation of DMHg raises questions about the stability of

354

DMHg influencing its fate in seawater. Unlike particle-reactive MMHg (and Hg(II)), which can be

355

scavenged and exported to deeper waters and sediments, DMHg, as a neutral dissolved gas, and may

356

persist in the water column [89]. Early studies suggested that DMHg is highly stable in the deep ocean

357

[20], while the photolytic degradation of DMHg [21,60], demethylation in surface waters [87], and

358

evasion to the atmosphere [86,90] are important loss mechanisms. There is a lack of experimentally

359

determined in situ rates but stability experiments indicated that DMHg remained stable over a period

360

of at least 20 days [91] to weeks [22].

361

Our experimental set-up was not designed to assess the stability of DMHg. Based on the importance

362

of DMHg within the ambient MeHg pool, we hypothesize that both the formation and stability of DMHg

363

are key to explain MeHg maxima. To test this hypothesis and the plausibility of our rates, we modeled

364

ambient Hg species along a vertical profile for the MED station.

365

We included two DMHg demethylation rates in our model runs, previously applied in coupled

366

biogeochemical models [8,9,49] a low rate of 2.2 x 10-9 s-1 (high DMHg stability) and a high rate of 1.9

367

x 10-8 s-1 (low DMHg stability) while keeping our fastest observed DMHg formation rate (5.71 x 10-8 s-1

368

at +20°C). Reduction, oxidation, methylation of Hg(II) to MMHg and demethylation of MMHg were

369

kept constant for both model scenarios (Table SI 5).

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7ps10 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0007-1234-8740 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

370

Overall the agreement between modeled THg and observational data was good, within a factor of 2

371

(see Figure SI 9), with better agreement in deep waters (>101 m) than for surface waters (0 – 101 m),

372

where THg was overestimated by ~110 % (Figure 4). Modeled Hg(0) deviated from observations, with

373

a good fit in the surface compared to our (Figure SI 10) and previous observations at the same station

374

(Figure SI 11, Figure SI 12) [29].

375

For MeHg species, subsurface observations for this and a previous study, could only be reproduced

376

under the high DMHg stability scenario (Figure 4A, Figure SI 11). The slight underestimation of MMHg

377

(<30 %, average) may be attributed to an underestimation of MMHg formation rates or its stability.

378

The 1D water column model supports the plausibility of our high DMHg formation rates, and indicates

379

that DMHg must be very stable. High DMHg stability mediates high DMHg concentrations, even if

380

methylation of Hg(II) to MMHg is slower than the demethylation of MMHg to Hg(II).

3.6. Environmental Implications

385

Our study highlights the important role of DMHg in the marine biogeochemical cycle of MeHg. We

386

demonstrate the potential for formation of DMHg in deep waters of two distinct environments,

387

consistent with the dominance of DMHg within the MeHg pool. Under our experimental conditions,

388

the formation of both MMHg and DMHg was limited to the subsurface waters and appeared to be

389

biotically mediated, as it was exclusively detected in the presence of particles and living cells.

390

Our modeling exercise suggests that both, the formation of MMHg and DMHg, as well as their stability,

391

are key to explain ambient MeHg concentrations. Our study indicates that DMHg formation rates

392

applied in current coupled biogeochemical models may be underestimated. In addition, current

393

models may underestimate the stability of DMHg [8,9]. Both methylation (of Hg(II) and MMHg) and

394

demethylation rates (of MMHg and DMHg) were kept constant in our model, and reproduced MeHg

395

observations well. However, it is likely that these rates exhibit a seasonal variability [11] driving

396

ambient seasonal MeHg variations in the MED [13] and elsewhere [88,92]. Future work should include

397

more MMHg and DMHg observations and further investigate seasonal changes, along with MMHg and

398

DMHg formation rates. We anticipate that systematically integrating microbial diversity and activity

399

data, with Hg species transformation rates, will help to better understand the marine Hg cycling which

400

is needed to update current models guiding future Hg mitigation strategies in the frame of the

401

Minamata Convention on Mercury.
