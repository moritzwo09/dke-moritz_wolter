Abstract
The ubiquity of microplastics in the marine environment has been highlighted in recent
years, yet the extent of microplastics pollution in coastal areas, especially off the coast of Japan,
remains unclear. Here we provide a comprehensive dataset of microplastic pollution in surface
water and sediment around coastal Japan. The survey encompasses 14 locations along Japanese
coasts from the northernmost in Hokkaido to the southern archipelago of Okinawa. The overall
microplastic concentration was 288.7 ± 651.6 g km2 and 1,185 ± 3,829 kg km2 for surface water
and sediment, respectively. A total of 53,674 particles were extracted from both sediment and
surface water as suspected microplastics using a series of sieving, density separation and
digestions. Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, 85% of particles from surface
water were identified as plastics and 70% in sediment. The main polymers found were the
widely used polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Analysis of sources and pathways
of microplastics revealed that rainfall, population, aquaculture and fisheries were major driver
of microplastic concentrations. This comprehensive survey highlights the rapid sinking of
microplastic in coastal areas and the urgent need for better waste management associated with
marine activities especially in rural areas.

Introduction
Marine plastic pollution continues to be a challenge as global plastic production has increased
to 400.3 million tonnes in 2022 1. An estimated 80 to 85% of the marine debris consist of
plastics from land-based sources 2,3. The ubiquity and presence of microplastics in the marine
environment have been widely discussed in recent scientific literature.2,4–10. Since its first use
in scientific literature11 the definition for “microplastics” has undergone several alterations with
the most agreed upon as “fragments of plastics < 5 mm in size” 12,13. Further categorization has
been included to differentiate microplastics based on source; primary and secondary 9,10.
Primary microplastics refers to items specifically designed with a small size and, employed in
various industrial applications such as starter pellets for fertilizers, air blasting technologies,
and microbeads in cosmetics etc. Secondary microplastics are those derived from the
breakdown of larger plastics through degradation such as shopping bags, ghost fishing nets,
and buoys used in maritime practice etc9.
The breakdown of plastics into smaller fragments is widely studied as it is an important factor
in the understanding of sources of microplastics and pathways to the marine environment.
Microplastic degradation can be attributed to both mechanical and chemical processes 14,15.
Exposure to environmental conditions, wind and waves decrease the stability of plastics and
causes fragmentation to occur. It is posited that a major part of the degradation process begins
on land, as plastics travel along rivers and waterways they are constantly washed onto the
riverbanks, increasing exposure to UV radiation and heat, becoming brittle, breaking down into
small fragments and re-entering the aquatic environment.7,16. However, the fragmentation of
larger items of plastics is not the only source of microplastics in the environment, as the direct
release of primary microplastics through industrial spillage, wastewater systems and
microbeads used in cosmetics contribute significantly to the accumulation of microplastics in
the marine environment.17.
According to Browne 18, it is important to distinguish between the sources and pathways
through which microplastic enters the environment. Sources should be used to describe the
origin while pathways should be used to elucidate the movement from the source to the various
habitats. The major sources outlined 18 include four categories, (i) larger plastics litter –
originating from fishing, shipping and other maritime counterparts; (ii) cleaning products – a
byproduct of industrial and domestic cleaning activities; (iii) medicines – microplastics used
in drug delivery for both human and animal treatments; (iv) textiles – as a results of washing
clothes. All sources have the common factor of land-based activities at some point in the

pathway to the marine habitat. Although, determining the individual source of microplastic
pollution may be difficult, polymer identification and chemical characterization may help to
provide some information on the origin of microplastic and the possible pathways involved.
17,18

. It is estimated annually between 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes of plastics enters the ocean

through river systems globally with 67% of the total riverine output being found in Asia 19.
While various indicators suggest high input from Asian countries 20, data to validate such
claims are limited. Nevertheless, East Asian seas have been labelled as a “hotspot” for
microplastic pollution due to the high concentrations within the region 21
While an increasing number of studies investigate the sources and distribution of microplastics
in the marine environment, the problem of “missing” plastics remains. The inputs from various
sources do not match the estimates of floating debris found in oceans 22,23. Retention of floating
debris in coastal areas with recurrent episodes of beaching, submersion, and sinking may
account for this missing debris 7,22 The individual characteristics of particles (e.g., size, density,
shape) play an important role in the pathways as denser films and items with a greater surfaceto-volume have a higher chance of being trapped in the coastal zone, becoming beached and
fragmenting into smaller fractions before re-entering the marine environment. Colonization by
biofilms and marine organism play an important role in the pathway of vertical transport from
the surface to sediments. 23.
Although the number of studies on microplastics in the coastal environment has increased
globally, the number of studies concerning Japanese coastal waters is limited 24. To this end the
Tara-JAMBIO (Japanese Association of Marine Biology) Joint Microplastic Survey aims to
provide knowledge on the status of microplastic pollution in the coastal environment around
Japan. A Japan-wide survey was undertaken from October 2020 to June 2023 with sampling at
14 locations along the Japanese coasts, utilizing the infrastructure (research vessels and
laboratories) of the JAMBIO network. The different hydrodynamic and societal contexts at the
sampling location allow for the investigation of the various sources and pathways of
microplastic pollution. This comprehensive sampling of surface water and sediment allowed
the compilation of the dataset of 53,557 particles of which 11,699 where chemically
characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). This study aims to
provide baseline data as the first comprehensive study Japanese coastal environment and
provide an easily reproducible method for large scale study of surface water and sediments.

Materials and Methods
Study Sites
The Tara-JAMBIO Joint Microplastics survey was a partnered initiative between the Tara
Ocean Japan, a Japanese antenna of the Tara Ocean Foundation and the Japanese Association
for Marine Biology (JAMBIO) which began in 2020 to conduct a Japan-wide survey in coastal
areas around Japan to assess the status of microplastic pollution in surface water and sediment.
Study sites were chosen based on the location of marine stations within the JAMBIO network
that would allow for ease of access and use of facilities for sampling. In 2020, five marine
stations were visited in western Japan from 13 October to 2 November; In 2021, three stations
located in northern Japan were visited from 19 July to 4 August; In 2022 stations located on
the coast of the Sea of Japan were visited; In September 2022 a station at the entrance of Tokyo
was visited and in June 2023 stations at southern island of Okinawa were visited. (See
Supplementary Information Figure 1) At each station a major river was identified, and samples
were taken along a transect from the estuary to the bay and offshore areas. A minimum of three
neuston samples and three sediment sample were taken at each marine station.
Field Sample Collection

Surface water samples were collected using a Neuston net (JMA Neuston net, RIGO Co. Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) (mesh size 350μm), fitted with a collection bucket at the end (RIGO Co. Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) (mesh size 315μm). The net was half submerged and towed alongside the
designated vessel at approximately 1~2 knots for a total time of 30 minutes, providing that the
submerged portion of the net opening was constant without showing signs of clogging. All
neuston samples were placed in aluminium zip lock bags and stored in a cool box for transport.
The samples were then stored at -20°C until treatment. A CTD (Rinko profiler, JFE Advantech,
Tokyo, Japan) was attached to the base of the net frame to collect environmental data for each
tow and a flow meter (RIGO Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) attached to the opening of the net to record
flow rate. GPS locations were taken at the start and end of every tow. At each location a blank
net was taken for control by submerging the net briefly with a new bucket (~1 min).
Sediment samples were collected from the research vessel, using a Smith & McIntyre Grab
Sampler (RIGO Co. Ltd Cat. No. 5144-AH) deployed to the side of the vessel. The samples
were placed directly into a U-Pack (0.1mm x 70 cm x100 cm Sanyu Sangyo Co. Ltd) for storage
and transport back to the lab. A CTD profile was taken at the same location as sediment
sampling. GPS locations were taken for every sediment grab and each CTD Profile.

Extraction of microplastic from surface water sample
Sieving and sample preparation
Samples were washed with tap water from the collecting sock into a 5 mm round stainless-steel
sieve and then into a custom-made filtration apparatus consisting of a PVC tube, with a preweighted 315 μm nylon mesh attached to one end via hose clip. The pre-weighed filter
containing the sample was then placed in a glass beaker and allowed to oven dry at 80°C until
completely dry and the weight of the filter and sample was then recorded.
Digestion
To further purify the microplastic sample and reduce debris before microscopic analysis, wet
peroxidation digestion using Fenton’s reagent was carried out (Masura et al. 2015). The dried
filtered material, recovered after density separation was transferred to a large beaker (1–2 L
depending on the volume of the sample, and to prevent overflow since the reaction is volatile)
and an initial 20 mL of 30% H2O2, followed by 20 mL of 0.05 mol L-1 acidic Iron Fe(II) solution
(prepared by adding 7.5 g of FeSO4.⋅7H2O to 500 mL of ultrapure water (Advantec®
RFU685DA) and 3 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid). This mixture was allowed to sit
uncovered for at least 5 minutes for the initial reaction to begin. After the initial reaction,
ultrapure water was used to wash down the sides of the beaker. A magnetic stir bar was added
to the beaker and then covered with a watch glass. The mixture was then heated to 75℃ (using
a hot plate with a stirrer) until gas bubbles were observed. To prevent overflow ultrapure water
was added periodically to wash down the sides of the beaker. The temperature was kept
constant at 75℃ and after every 30 minutes (or until no visible reaction) another 20 mL of 30%
H2O2 was added to the beaker. This was repeated until no organic matter was visible within a
four-hour limit. After the organic matter was dissolved, 6 g of NaCl (FUJIFILM Wako Pure
Chemical Co., Ltd.) per 20 mL of the digested mixture was added to the beaker and stirred until
completely dissolved. After cooling, the mixture (including undissolved matter) was
transferred to a large funnel (~3 L) with a stopcock attached at the end (using rubber hose and
hose clip). This mixture was then allowed to settle for approximately 24–72 hours depending
on the amount of solids, which was drained periodically until no large solids were visible. The
remaining solution containing microplastics was vacuum filtered onto a 90 mm Whatman paper
filter. The filter was then allowed to dry overnight in a loosely covered glass petri dish in
preparation for microscopic analysis.

Extraction of microplastic from sediment sample
Sieving and density separation
Each sample was washed with tap water using a stacked box mesh consisting of 5 mm and then
300 μm size opening respectively. Samples were washed until the wastewater ran clear
indicating fine silt and mud was removed. Samples were placed in pre-weighted stainless-steel
trays and oven-dried at 80℃ until completely dry. Sample dry weight was then recorded at
room temperature. An initial density separation step was done to recover microplastics in the
sediment and reduce sample volume by adding super-saturated NaCl (1.2 g mL-1) solution
prepared by adding 358.5 g of NaCl (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.) to 1 L of
ultrapure water 25. Dried sediment was added to a 3000 mL glass beaker and the NaCl solution
was added until 8–10 cm above the sediment. This mixture was agitated by stirring with a
stainless-steel spatula for 2–3 minutes and left to rest for 1 hour allowing the sediment to settle
and, microplastic and other buoyant materials to float to the top. All floating matter was poured
into a custom-made filtration apparatus consisting of a PVC tube, with a 315 μm nylon mesh
attached to one end via a hose clip. Ultrapure water was used to wash the floating material to
remove excess NaCl after each recovery. The agitation and filtration steps were repeated three
times for each sample using a new NaCl solution each time to ensure maximum recovery of
plastic fragments. Filtered material containing microplastic was allowed to dry in a covered
glass petri dish at 80°C for 24–48 hours to reduce moisture in the sample. After these additional
steps were completed, digestion and final extraction were carried out using the same methods
for surface water in preparation for microscopic analysis.
Quality control
To minimize contamination all apparatus used were either glass or stainless steel and was
washed with ultrapure water (Advantec® RFU685DA). Latex or nitrile gloves were worn for
all procedures and a 100% cotton lab coat was used. All steps were carried out on a sanitized
clean bench with positive air flow for both sediment and surface water respectively. When not
in use the filtration apparatus was covered in aluminium foil. Procedural blanks were taken by
leaving an uncovered paper filter while processing samples, no contamination was found. For
blank nets collected during surface water sampling, less than 5 particles were found in some
while none in others.

Microscopy
Microscopic analysis for surface water and sediment, was done in both bright field and
fluorescence to ensure maximum recovery of microplastic particles using Olympus SZX16
Reflected Fluorescence System (Filters: SZX2: FUV-BP330-385, BA420; FGFPA-BP460-495,
BA510-550; FGFPHQ-BP460-480, BA495-540) with an Olympus DP21 Digital Camera
attached for photoimaging. A glass petri dish containing the filtered samples was placed on the
stage of the microscope, and using a pair of pincette, all suspected microplastic were pickedup, placed into a separate glass dish, photographed, and collected in a pre-weighted glass vial
with a screw-capped. After completing the pick-up for each sample, the vial was then weighed.
ImageJ Analysis
Feret diameter and microplastic type were documented from the photographs using ImageJ
software (Schneider, Rasband, and Eliceiri 2012). Photographs were analysed using a custom
macro that allowed tracing of individual items of plastic, calculation of the Feret diameter,
surface area and recording of the microplastic type. (See Supplementary Information for the
custom macro). Microplastic types were classified as three main categories based on shape and
form: rigid, sheet and fibre. Rigid was described as pellets, balls of entangled fibres, or foam
like fragments resembling pellets or beads. Sheet was described as films or ribbons of plastic.
Fibre was described as cords or filamentous items of plastic. Fibre type microplastic was
excluded from the calculation of Feret diameter and therefore excluded from size distribution
analysis in this study.
Chemical characterization
Ni10 ThermoFisher microFT-IR was used for the chemical characterization of particles
suspected to be microplastic. Reflectance was used as the mode of analysis since the size of
particles was highly variable (100–5,000µm). A modified coning and quartering method 26 was
used to randomize and reduce the size of samples that contained large amounts of particles
before analysis. Selected particles were mounted onto a gold slide on which three 15 x 15 mm
areas were demarcated using tape of known composition. For each sample, several mosaics
were taken using OMNIC Picta software, and maps were produced for multipoint spectra
collection to increase time efficiency. Collected maps were then split into individual spectra
for analysis using the OMNIC Specta suite of libraries (See Supplementary Information Table
3). The number of particles selected for analysis was varied between > 10% or 100% per sample
according to the volume of each sample. Analysed spectra were compiled into an Excel Sheet
and used for statistical analyses.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analysis and figures were computed using R software v4.4.0 27 The packages
‘ggplot2’, ‘dplyr’, ‘tibble’, ‘stringr’, ‘tidyr’ from the ‘tidvverse’ 28 and ‘ggpubr’ 29 together with
‘patchwork’ 30 were used for data manipulation and production of figures. Microplastic
concentration and driver variables were modelled using the “lm” function of the ‘vegan’
package 31. nMDS was calculated for the difference in community composition of polymer
type in surface water and sediment using the ‘vegan’ package and PERMANOVA was done to
test the statistical significance between surface water and sediment. For the comparison
between the community composition of polymers, two samples (one surface sample from
Takehara and one sediment sample from Tateyama) were removed from the analysis as they
consisted of only 1 and 2 particles, respectively, identified as “other plastics”. The difference
in the size distribution of feret diameter among the different matrices was computed using the
‘glmer’ function in the ‘lme4’ package 32 and “lmer” function was used to assess the
relationship between feret diameter and distance from river.
Explanatory Variables as Drivers of Change in Microplastic Concentrations
Variables used for stepwise regression analysis were selected based on a priori knowledge from
literature 5,7,9,16,24,33–36 suggesting factors which may influence microplastic concentration. The
direction for stepwise regression was ‘both’
The following explanatory variables were selected for analysis: surface microplastic
concentration (g km2), distance from river (m), rainfall – up to ten days before, including
sample day(mm), chlorophyll a – average of neuston tows (µg L -1), total population
agglomeration (n), total metropolitan population (n), fishery catch (tonnes), aquaculture
accumulative (tonnes) and end member contribution (%). The end member contribution
represents the percentage of river water at the sampling location. It was calculated using the
salinity measured at the sampling location and assuming a salinity of 0 for the river water.
For sediment: surface microplastic concentration (g km2), distance from river (m), sample dry
weight (g), rainfall – up to ten days before, including sample day (mm), total metropolitan
population (n), chlorophyll a – average of top 1 m profile (µg L -1), fishery catch (tonnes),
aquaculture accumulative (tonnes) and end member contribution (%).

Surface water
The overall microplastic concentration for surface water was 288.7 ± 651.6 g km -2
(Figure. 1a). For comparison with other studies the mean weight of particles per volume of
water filtered for surface water was calculated to be 0.79 ± 1.75 mg m-3.
A total of 44,410 particles were extracted from the surface water as suspected
microplastics. Particles were then grouped into three categories based on morphology (rigid,
sheet, fibre; Figure.1b) The dominant morphology of particles in the surface water was rigid
fragments representing 77% of the total suspected microplastics.
A total of 11,700 (21.8%) particles were chemically characterized from suspected
microplastic particles. In surface water 85% were positively identified as plastics, 7% as nonplastics and 8% as unidentified particles. The main polymers found were polyethylene (PE),
polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polymethyl pentene (PMP) and polymethacrylate
(PMA) (Figure. 1d.) Other plastics consisted of polyamide, nylon, polyacrylate, and polyester.
Unknown represented the proportion of spectra matches that could not identified through our
extensive library.
Analysis of the environmental and socio-economic factors together with suspected
microplastic concentration for surface water (Figure. 1 e-h) showed that rainfall (p < 0.01),
accumulative aquaculture (p = 0.07), total population agglomeration (p = 0.01) and
accumulative fishery catch (p = 0.08) were the main explanatory factors. The model including
these four parameters had an AIC of 168.95 (adjusted r2 = 0.18, p = 0.03). Both rainfall
(coefficient: 4.56 x 10-02 ± 1.72 x 10-02, p =0.01) and Accumulative Aquaculture (coefficient:
3.74 x 10-05 ± 1.95 x 10-05, p = 0.07) showed a positive trend with suspected surface water
microplastics concentration, while Total Population Agglomeration (coefficient: -3.61 x 10-06
± 1.41 x 10-06, p = 0.02) and Accumulative Fishery Catch (coefficient: -1.83 x 10-05 ± 1.02 x
10-05, p = 0.08) were negatively associated.

Sediment
The overall microplastic concentration for sediment (Figure 2a) was 1,185 ± 3,829 kg
km2. For comparison with the mean number of particles per kilogram of dry sample weight
was 2,579 ± 8,506 pieces kg-1.

A total of 9,264 particles were extracted from sediment samples as suspected
microplastics particles (Fig 2b). The dominant morphology of the total suspected microplastics,
for sediment was sheet type representing 53.7%.
In the sediment 70% of the particles were identified as plastics, 7% as non-plastics and
23% as unidentified particles (Figure 2c). The main polymers found were polyethylene (PE),
polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyacrylate (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polymethacrylate (PMA) (Figure.2d). Other plastics comprised
of nylon, polycarbonate, and silicone.
Analysis of the environmental and socio-economic factors together with suspected
microplastic concentration for sediment showed total metropolitan population (p < 0.001),
accumulative aquaculture (p <0.001), rainfall (p < 0.001), and end member contribution (p <
0.01) to be the most significant explanatory variables. The model had an AIC of 106.57
(adjusted r2 = 0.63, p < 0.001). Total metropolitan population (coefficient: 2.56 x 10-06 ± 5.69
x 10-07, p < 0.001) and accumulative aquaculture (coefficient: 5.31x 10-05 ± 1.15 x 10-05, p <
0.001) both had positive trends in relation to the suspected sediment microplastic concentration,
while rainfall (coefficient: -6.46 x 10-02 ± 1.58 x 10-02, p < 0.001) and end member contribution
(coefficient: 4.27 x 10-01 ± 1.25 x 10-01, p < 0.01) were negatively associated.

Size distribution of microplastics
The suspected microplastics were significantly larger in sediment than in surface water
(GLMM: p < 0.001) with a mean feret diameter of 1.46 ± 1.03 and 1.77 ± 0.94 mm (median
1.23 ± 0.93 and 1.49 ±1.03 mm) in surface water and sediment, respectively

Polymer compositions
Visualization of the community composition of polymer types using nMDS showed distinct
communities in surface water and sediment (PERMANOVA: p < 0.001). Denser plastics such
as PET (1.38 g cm-3), PVC (1.4- 1.42 g cm-3), Polyacrylate (1.07-1.16 g cm-3) and other plastics
(e.g., nylon (1.15 g cm-3) were present only in the sediment, while less dense polymers such as
PE (0.89-0.97 g cm-3), PP (0.87-0.92g cm-3) and PS (1.04-1.08 g cm-3) were found in both
sediment and surface water.

Discussion
The presence of microplastics in the marine environment has been documented globally, not
only in coastal areas but also in the deep sea and the polar regions. However the exact status of
microplastic pollution remains widely unknown 2,4,9–11,36. Previous studies have attempted to
summarize the global distribution of microplastics in the world ocean through numerical
modelling 8,21,37. These models, however, have excluded sediment microplastics due to the lack
of available data, limiting the possibility of a comprehensive representation of the status of
microplastics pollution in the world ocean. Here, we provide for the first time a comprehensive
dataset on microplastic pollution in coastal surface waters and sediments of Japan, using
established protocols and methods that allows the comparison of surface water and sediment
plastic pollution. The data showed and confirmed the ubiquity of microplastics in coastal areas,
and the potential role of sediment as a sink for microplastics. Sources and pathways were
investigated showing the importance of both environmental and socioeconomic factors in
driving microplastic concentrations in coastal areas.
The surface water microplastic concentration found in our study was similar (0.79 ± 1.75 mg
m-3 ) to the global average found (0.79 mg m-3 Isobe et al. 2021). However, it should be noted
that data in our study reflect surface water only, while Isobe et al 21 reported it for the entire
water column not including sediment. Thus, extrapolating our data to the entire water column
would certainly lead to a higher mean concentration than the global average. Our data showed
that surface water microplastics concentrations higher than that found in the Mediterranean Sea
(61.6 ± 83.7 g km-2 Pedrotti et al. 2022), the Eurasian Arctic (0.0037 mg m-3 Yakushev et al.
2021) and in Japanese rivers (0.44 mg m-3 Kataoka et al. 2019). The sediment microplastic
concentration in our study was higher (2,579 ± 8,506 pieces kg-1 dry sediment ) than reported
for Tokyo Bay (1,845-5,385 pieces kg-1 dry sediment Matsuguma et al. 2017), Hiroshima Bay
(24-253 pieces kg-1 dry sediment Sagawa, Kawaai, and Hinata 2018), Venice Lagoon (6722,175 pieces kg-1 dry sediment Vianello et al. 2013) and the Belgian coast (Harbor: 67-391
pieces kg-1 dry sediment, Continental Shelf: 71-270 pieces kg-1 dry sediment Claessens et al.
2011). Higher concentrations of both surface water and sediment microplastics, in coastal areas
suggests the trapping of particles near the shore, since transport of microplastics may be slower
in areas where the outflow from estuaries meets the ocean 36.
The methods used for the study of microplastics in sediment 34–36,41 often differed in sampling
techniques, (corers, Van-Veen grabs, box-corers) laboratory methods used for extraction,
analysis of particles, (digested or non-digested) and the units for reporting concentrations found

(pieces/kg dry sediment or pieces/m2) This variation in sampling and analytical techniques
affect the overall results of each study, leading to a problem of incomparability. This highlights
the need for the use of standardized protocols that allow harmonization between studies, and
while there has been a certain effort in this direction for surface water studies, harmonization
of the methods used for sediment is still lacking.
A significant portion of microplastics < 1mm are “missing”, since the assumed inputs from
land-based sources do not reflect the quantities reported on the ocean surface 8,7, This
discrepancy suggests that sedimentation of microplastics occurs readily in the marine
environment. Sediment microplastic concentrations were found to be an order of magnitude
higher than surface water. This is consistent with data reported for Hiroshima Bay 34 and Tokyo
Bay 35, which are the only other known studies within Japan as well as coastal areas of
Guangdong, South China 42 and river mouths of Manila Bay 38. The higher concentrations of
microplastics found in sediment highlight the sinking of microplastic particles in the coastal
ocean. The exact processes involved in the vertical transfer of microplastics from surface water
to sediment are still widely unknown 8.
Selectivity of larger particles of microplastics occur along the shoreline in coastal areas where
debris becomes beached. UV radiation and temperature encourage fragmentation of particles
before being reintroduced and resuspended into the marine environment either by wind or wave
motion, which is then transported towards offshore areas or may sediment along closer to the
shore 7. Larger particles, sheet type and denser polymers (PET, PVC, PMA, PAA) and other
plastics (nylon, polyamide etc.) were found in higher concentration in the sediment compared
to the surface water, suggesting a selective sinking of these particles. Overall, our data suggest
that rapid selective sinking of microplastics occurs in the coastal areas, before they reach
offshore waters.
The source of marine microplastics can be land-based anthropogenic activities and maritime
activities 2,37, however the sources and pathways which can exacerbate inputs into the
environment remain unclear. Contrary to our expectations, our data showed a decreasing
sediment microplastic concentration with an increasing proportion of river water, and the
proportion of river water was not an explanatory predictor of the surface water concentrations.
Sedimentation rates of microplastics can be influenced by the complex and dynamic nature in
estuaries which show variable conditions (high turn-over) and strong gradients of
physicochemical (salinity, temperature, pH, etc.) and biological parameters 43. As items of

plastics travel along waterways, they become colonized by algae and bacteria creating biofilms.
This biofouling can affect the density of particles, causing them to sink faster. Another factor
that can affect the biofouling and sinking of particles is salinity 16,33,44. Factors such as the
hydrology of the surrounding estuary, wind, tidal regimes and sedimentation rates, which are
beyond the scope of this study may also play an important role in the movement and transport
of microplastics 45–47. The removal of biofilms caused by disturbances (bioturbation, wave
action, tidal movement) of the upper surface of the benthos also affects the vertical migration
of microplastics 48 altering the rates of sedimentation, resuspension and removal of particles.
Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, we hypothesize the removal of microplastic
particles to be linked with an increased volume of freshwater in coastal areas.
Rainfall has been reported as an influential source of input, where microplastics concentrations
differed in both mass and count with seasonality 16 and the occurrence of storms 49. Run-off
after rainfall introduces microplastics from the land into waterways which flow into the ocean
to contribute to the inputs and behaviour of microplastics in coastal areas 43. For surface water
a positive relationship was seen, which suggest high inputs of floating microplastics in coastal
areas following rainfall. However, a negative relationship was observed between sediment
microplastic concentration and rainfall which is consistent with the reverse trend observed for
microplastic concentration in sediment and the proportion of river water at the sampling site.
Thus, the behaviour of microplastics particles changes based on the increased volume of water
post rainfall where resuspension and relocation occurs relative to the hydrology of the estuarine
area 45,46,50.
The polymers identified for microplastics cannot be traced to a definitive source but can be
attributed to a range of land-based and maritime activities. PE and PP were found to be the
dominant polymer in both matrices and are ubiquitous in the ocean 51 but also on land 52. These
polymers are also the most commercially produced polymers and are largely used in packaging
and other single-use applications 53 and are widely found in wastewater leakage 54, highlighting
the direct relation between plastic use and leak in the environment. Moreover, the population
of the metropolitan area, which often encompasses the whole watershed was found to be
positively correlated with sediment microplastic concentrations, while the total population
agglomeration for coastal areas had a negative correlation with surface water microplastic
concentration. Therefore, as rivers are a major input source of microplastics into the ocean 20,
the integrated watershed management practices employed and waste management systems
available should be considered for both inland areas along waterways and coastal settlements5.

Characteristics of land use practices (urban agriculture ratio) within river basins were found to
be correlated to the microplastics concentrations in Japanese rivers 16. The waste management
practices of rural coastal communities must also be considered since larger metropolitan
agglomerations may have more effective waste management systems than coastal areas, as
reflected by the positive and negative correlations shown in our data for metropolitan and
coastal areas.
Marine activities are a non-negligeable source of plastics pollution in the ocean, with 86% of
the mega plastics found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch estimated to originate from fishing
nets55. Aquaculture was the third and first predictor of microplastic concentration in surface
water and sediment, respectively. Fragmentation from larger items such as buoys, nets and
other derelict gear may influence the microplastic concentrations within an area where such
activity is prevalent 18,56,57. As maritime activities such as fishing, aquaculture and shipping are
predicted to increase 58, there is an urgent need for legislation regarding removal and recycling
of derelict gear for both the fishing and aquaculture industries. This is particularly true in rural
coastal areas where waste management of derelict gear from these activities may be left
unmanned. From our observations during sample collection in some areas it was noted that
large quantities of equipment were left exposed, which increases the likelihood of weathering
and fragmentation over time.
The ubiquitous nature of microplastics in the marine environment has been reported
globally for both sediment and surface waters. However, few studies have reported on the
present status of microplastics pollution in coastal areas of Japan. The inconsistency in
sampling techniques, methods of extraction, and units of reporting microplastic concentrations
prove to be a major challenge in this emerging field, especially for microplastics in marine
sediments, highlighting the need for reproducible methods and data to assess the extent of
microplastic pollution in the marine environment, understand their dynamics and design
management strategies to tackle this environmental problem. This study encompasses a large
geographic range with diverse socio-economic context and provides baseline data on
microplastics in coastal waters and sediment around Japan. The data obtained showed higher
concentrations of microplastics in sediments than in surface water suggesting a high rate of
sedimentation occurring in coastal areas, especially for the larger-sized and denser plastic
particles. Thus, sediment may represent an important sink for microplastics in coastal areas.
The investigation of socio-economic and environmental factors influencing microplastic
concentrations in both surface water and sediment highlighted rainfall, population, aquaculture

and fisheries to be major inputs of microplastics into the environment. However, greater work
is necessary to fully understand the sources and pathways of microplastics from land to prevent
leakages into the environment. This will require the quantification of anthropogenic activities
along coastal areas, the assessment of waste management systems and the detailed recording
of integrated watershed use along associated waterways. Nevertheless, our study shows the
importance of both land and maritime activities as sources of microplastic particularly in rural
areas. Now more than ever, there exists an urgent need for legislation to improve waste
management for both land and maritime activities to stop plastic entering the ocean.
