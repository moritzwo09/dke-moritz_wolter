ABSTRACT

Plastic waste is now pervasive in the environment, breaking down into microplastics and
nanoplastics under many environmental conditions. These particles have been found in various
ecosystems and even in human tissues, raising significant environmental and health concerns. In
this study, we investigated the interaction of polystyrene nanoplastics, with and without surface
modifications, on biomembrane structures using contrast-matching small-angle neutron scattering
and neutron spin echo spectroscopy. The neutron contrast matching enabled selective study of
biomembranes in the presence of nanoplastics. Two model membranes were employed: a simple
zwitterionic bilayer (i.e., dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine [DMPC]) and an Escherichia coli lipid
extract as a bacterial membrane model. The results show profound membrane disruptions,
including thinning, vesicle fragmentation, lipid monolayer formation, and inter-vesicle
aggregation, with the most severe effects observed in DMPC membranes. Notably, E. coli
membranes exhibited greater resilience, suggesting that biological membranes with diverse lipid
compositions may mitigate some nanoplastic particle–induced damage. These findings highlight
the potential risks posed by environmental nanoplastic particles to biological membranes, with
insights for molecular-level interactions and the environmental toxicity of nanoplastics. This work
provides a foundation for future studies into nanoplastic–biomembrane interactions and their
broader implications for health and environment.

1. INTRODUCTION
Plastic waste is now ubiquitous in the environment. Under environmental factors such as
moderate temperature, solar radiation, oxidative conditions, and many others, plastic waste is
being reduced to small particles [1,2]. The transformation of plastic items into finer plastic
particles, including so-called microplastics and nanoplastics is now recognized as a continuous
process in the environment. Recent studies demonstrate that even supposedly stable plastics can
degrade into fine particles under common environmental conditions [3–5]. They have been
shown to affect all kingdoms of life, both directly and indirectly; the most significant harm has
been observed in marine environments [6].
Recent studies highlight the pervasive nature of microplastics and nanoplastics: they have been
found in various ecosystems and even in human tissues. For instance, researchers have detected
nanoplastics in human placentas, raising concerns about potential influence on fetal development
[7]. Additionally, nanoplastics have been observed crossing the blood–brain barrier in animal
models, suggesting possible neurological effects [8]. Nanoplastics promote in vitro aggregation
of α-synuclein, which is associated with dementias such as Parkinson’s disease [9]. In vitro
studies have shown that micro- and nanosized plastic particles can accumulate in the tissues of
various living organisms, including mussels, shrimp, and fish [10–12]. These results all point to
the presence of plastic particles in biosphere as a potentially significant environmental and health
issue, motivating the urgent need to understand the interaction of plastic particles at different
biological levels [13].
In this study, we focus on how nanoplastic particles (NPs) with different surface modifications
interact and modify biomembrane molecular structures under various conditions using contrast-

matching small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), along with additional insights into membrane
dynamics from neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy. NPs have been found to have a greater
potential for accumulation and translocation within host tissues [11,14,15] than their micro-sized
counterpart. Many studies to date show that particle size is a primary factor for plastic particles
in entering and distributing within tissues and cells. The significantly increased surface area of
smaller plastic particles can also adsorb and transport organic pollutants [16], transforming them
into vehicles for toxic substances within host organisms. They can act as Trojan horses,
facilitating the uptake of other environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent
organic pollutants [17–20]. Biomembranes are important semipermeable barriers that separate
cells or organelles from their surrounding environment and are crucial interfaces for many
biological processes. Recent evidence suggests that plastic particles can enter cells via various
pathways, including endocytosis and direct membrane penetration [21–25]. Some studies have
also shown the destabilizing effect on lipid membranes [26–31]; however, direct experimental
insights into how NPs alter membrane structure during their interaction are currently lacking.
SANS is a bulk technique capable of providing hierarchical structure information across
different length scales from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers simultaneously. It is
a key method for probing from trans-bilayer membrane structure to overall vesicle morphology
in solutions [32–37]. The different sensitivity of neutrons to hydrogen and deuterium allows
varying contrast between solute and solvent by changing D2O/H2O ratios of the latter [38,39].
The contrast matching with this isotopic sensitivity enabled selective observation of membrane
structure by eliminating the scattering from NPs. NSE spectroscopy reveals sub-microsecond
dynamic motions on length scales from a few to hundreds of nanometers, allowing the derivation
of various elastic-mechanical properties, such as membrane bending modulus and bilayer area

compressibility, to corroborate the structure changes [40–42]. Two model membrane systems
were selected for this study: 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) as a simple
zwitterionic model bilayer, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) total lipid extract as a model for
bacterial membranes that are ubiquitous in the environment. Notably, fully deuterated E. coli
cells were grown, and their total lipid was extracted and used to enhance neutron contrast.
Spherical polystyrene (PS) NPs with well-defined and uniform size were selected as a model
particle. They are either unmodified or surface modified such as aminated PS (AM) (positively
charged) and carboxylated PS (CM) (negatively charged). Although this model system may not
fully capture the heterogeneity of environmental NPs, their well-defined size and properties have
enabled recent research to provide valuable insights into the environmental impact of NPs
[9,14,15,27].
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Nanoplastics and Lipids
PS latex particles, including unmodified PS and surface-modified AM and CM, were purchased
from Magsphere Inc (Pasadena, California). The diameters are 38 nm for PS (Lot No. PS3455A620), 43 nm for CM (Lot No. CM3160C), and 53 nm for AM (Lot No. AM4818A). The stocks
were in aqueous suspension at a concentration of 10% w/v. Chain per-deuterated DMPC (D54DMPC) and regular protiated DMPC were purchased from Avanti Lipids (Birmingham, Alabama).
They were used as delivered.
To produce E. coli total lipid, E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain was inoculated into 5 mL of Luria–Bertani
media from glycerol stock and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The cell cultures were then adapted
to grow in D2O Enfors-based minimal media with D-glycerol as the carbon source. The cells

underwent three exchanges of media to ensure complete adaption from H2O to D2O-based media.
Then the culture was grown at 37 °C overnight in the D2O Enfors minimal media [43]
supplemented with D-glycerol with initial inoculation at an optical density at 600 nm of
approximately 0.1. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000× g for 30 min and then
washed with 1% NaCl three times followed by freeze-drying for 48 h before lipid extraction. The
E. coli total lipid was extracted using the modified Bligh and Dyer method [44]. In brief, 250 mL
chloroform, 500 mL methanol, and 200 mL water were sequentially added to the freeze-dried cells
(1.1 g) to achieve a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 1:2:0.8 (v/v/v). The cells were
vortexed for 15 s immediately following the addition of each solvent and allowed to stand for
approximately 18 h at room temperature with stirring. This process was followed by the addition
of chloroform (250 mL) and water (250 mL) to obtain a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of
1:1:0.9 (v/v/v) to separate the aqueous and organic fractions of the mixture. A separatory funnel
was used to collect the lower chloroform phase, which contains the lipid extract. The chloroform–
methanol mixture was then evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotovap (Buchi, R-205).
The lipid extract was dried under vacuum overnight.
2.2. Large Unilamellar Vesicle Preparation
The large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared following the method established
previously [37,45]. Briefly, D54-DMPC or E. coli lipid was dispersed in 26% v/v D2O to obtain
15 mg/mL stock solution. After extensive vortexing, the solutions underwent at least three
freeze-thaw cycles by alternately placing them on a hot plate at 30 °C and in a freezer at −80 °C.
The LUVs were made using an Avanti mini-extruder (Alabaster, Alabama), with membranes of
0.1 µm diameter pores. The solution was extruded for 21 passes for the final LUV solutions.
Different PS suspensions were titrated into the final LUV solutions to achieve different particle

concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% w/v. The samples were stored at 4 °C for up to one week if
not immediately measured.
2.3. SANS Experiment
The SANS measurements were performed using the BIO-SANS instrument at the High Flux
Isotope Reactor and the EQ-SANS instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), both US
Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL) [46], and the Bilby instrument at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology
Organisation’s OPAL reactor [47]. The lipid solutions were transferred into quartz circular cells
with a 1 mm beam path (Hellma, Germany) for measurements. The samples were kept at 30 °C,
and instruments were set to a Q range covering 0.003 to 0.5 Å−1. The acquired data were
subsequently processed using the facility-provided data reduction software, resulting in 1D
scattering curves (I vs. Q) presented in absolute scale, where I is the scattering intensity arising
from the contrast between the lipids and the solvent, and Q is the scattering vector from
Q = 4πsinθ/λ, where θ is half of the scattering angle, and λ is the neutron wavelength.
2.4. SANS Data Analysis
To determine the contrast matching point (CMP) of PS NPs, the scattering intensity I was
measured at different D2O ratios (v/v). From a linear regression of √I vs. D2O ratio (v/v), the
CMP, in terms of D2O ratio, was determined as the line intercepts the zero intensity [38].
The data fitting was performed in SASView software (sasview.org). According to the scattering
profiles and different Q ranges corresponding to their length scales, various fittings can be
performed to extract structural information. The overall power law decay of intensity is

described by I(Q) = scale × q−p + background, where the exponent factor p provides a
dimensional description of the scattering object.
The trans-bilayer membrane structure, dominated by the hydrocarbon chain high in deuterium,
was modeled as a single slab of neutron scattering length density. It was fitted with an isotropic
lamellar model. The scattering intensity I(Q) for the randomly oriented bilayer in a vesicle is
I(Q) = scale × (2πP(Q)/Q²d) + background, where the form factor is P(Q) = (2Δρ²/Q²) × (1 −
cos(Qd)). The total layer thickness is given by d, and Δρ is the scattering length density
difference (the contrast) between the lipid and the solvent [48]. The polydispersity of the
thickness d is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution implemented in SASView. In the case of
inter-bilayer peak presented in the data, a Caillè structure factor is used as implemented in
SASView to determine the d-spacing.
A generalized Guinier–Porod function is used to fit low-Q data when applicable. This empirical
model provides the size and dimensionality of the sample, including shape intermediates
between typical well-defined 1D, 2D, or 3D shapes (e.g., long rod, thin/extended sheet, or
globular particle, respectively) [49]. In the case of a possible globular 3D shape within the Q
range, the Guinier function is used to obtain the radius of gyration Rg by fitting I(Q) = scale ×
exp{(−Q²Rg²/3)} + background [50].
2.5. NSE Experiment and Data Analysis
NSE experiments were performed at the SNS NSE instrument (BL-15) at ORNL [51].
Three different NPs were titrated to the protiated DMPC LUVs in D2O to 1% concentration. The
samples were measured at 30 °C with a precision of ±0.5 °C. Two neutron wavelength bands of
5–8 Å and 8–11 Å were chosen to cover Fourier times from about 0.07 to 100 ns and a Q range of

about 0.055–0.10 Å−1. Background was subtracted from D2O samples with the same sample cell
size. Data reduction was performed using the DrSPINE program [52].
The data analysis follows Zilman and Granek [53], using a freestanding single-membrane

fluctuation model to fit the intermediate scattering function 𝑆(𝑄,0) = 𝑒 −(Γ(Q) 𝑡)3 , where Q and t are
the wavenumber transfer and the Fourier time, respectively. Then the Q-dependent relaxation rate

viscosity of D2O at 30 °C.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Effects on DMPC LUV
First, from the contrast variation series measured at different D2O ratios, we determined that the
CMP for PS NPs is 26% D2O (Fig. 1). Therefore, all the samples with LUV were prepared in
26% D2O to eliminate the scattering from PS NPs and highlight deuterated lipids D54-DMPC
and E. coli lipid with CMP of approximately 95% D2O (D54 chain) and approximately 101.7%
D2O-equivalent [56], respectively.

data points to the zero-intensity line indicates that the PS CMP is 26% D2O.

DMPC is a zwitterionic lipid with relatively flat intrinsic curvature. It is widely used to form
unilamellar vesicles as a simple model membrane system[32,36]. The SANS data covers a large
span of length scales including an overall morphology of the LUVs (low Q, ~< 0.01 Å−1), a large
expanse of bilayer thin sheet (medium Q range ~0.01 to ~0.04 Å−1) and a trans-bilayer structure
(high Q, ~> 0.04 Å−1); the length scale in the real space relates to the reciprocal space Q by 2π/Q.
For almost all DMPC samples, the low-Q scattering intensity exhibits generally the same slope
as in the medium Q range (Fig. 2, as shown parallel to the dash line). The slope can be obtained
as a power law exponent of about 2, consistent with a thin 2D sheet structure and typical of LUV
lipid bilayer.

The high-Q region shows the more detailed structure across the lipid bilayer. The DMPC-only
scattering profile displays a sharp minimum near Q = 0.2 Å⁻¹, indicating a well-defined bilayer–
water interface and a slab-like deuterated hydrocarbon chain within the bilayer. Upon addition of
NPs, all minima are reduced to blunt kinks, suggesting increased bilayer thickness
polydispersity. The much shallower slope approaching the kinks further shows the bilayer–water
interface is blurrier because the Porod exponent deviates to much less than 4 [57].
The effect of the different NP types and concentrations overall vesicle morphology also varies.
For AM, at a very high concentration (2%), the scattering curve starts to flatten at low Q,
suggesting the formation of particles smaller than the original LUVs, possibly smaller vesicles
(Fig. 2A). Fitting these data with the Guinier–Porod function yields an Rg of approximately 148
Å, much smaller than the extruded LUV radius of about 500 Å. Both sizes likely coexist. By
contrast, the Porod exponent is close to 2, indicating that the large bilayer thin sheet remains
present. The high-Q data (>0.04 Å⁻¹) were further fitted by the lamellar model for the transbilayer structure. The DMPC-only sample shows a thickness of 27.6 ± 0.1 Å without the
thickness polydispersity (Table 1). Adding AM significantly reduces the bilayer thickness and
significantly increases the thickness polydispersity (Fig. 3A). For example, 0.5% of AM thins the
bilayer to 24.6 ± 0.2 Å with about 19% polydispersity. Then 1% AM further thins the bilayer and
increases polydispersity. The trend partially reverses at 2% AM with slightly increased thickness
and decreased polydispersity then at 1% AM, coincident with the possible formation of smaller
vesicles. If the thinning effect is caused by the stretching of membrane in the presence of AM
NPs [26,58], then the reduction may indicate that the tension caused by AM particles is partially
relieved as smaller vesicles start to form (Fig. 3B).

CM also induces thickness changes, although less drastically than AM. As shown in Fig. 2B,
the power law exponents are the same as the DMPC sample at all concentrations. Smaller
vesicles do not form. The lamellar model fitting results show a general decreasing bilayer
thickness and increasing polydispersity as the CM concentration increases (Fig. 3A). The
thickness changes to 18.3 ± 1.1 Å, and polydispersity is greater than 50%, indicating a
significant disturbance of CM on the membrane.
Unmodified PS NPs exhibited the most significant change (Fig. 2C). At only 0.5%
concentration, much smaller particles are formed, as indicated by the leveling scattering profile

at low Q. This can be fitted with the Guinier function. The result indicates the Rg of the smaller
particles is about 100 Å. Then, at higher concentrations of 1% and 2%, the scattering profiles
revert to a power law decay with exponent of about 2. However, the identical undulation near
0.01 Å⁻¹ (highlighted by arrows in Fig. 2C) from both samples indicates a mixture of smaller
particles like the ones presented in the 0.5% PS sample. Fitting at the high-Q region reveals a
significant decrease in lamellar thickness at 1% and 2% PS. The thickness at 2% PS is almost
halved compared with the DMPC-only sample, accompanied by greatly increased polydispersity
to more than 75%. This result suggests great disruption of bilayer by the PS NPs to form
monolayer, likely on the surface of hydrophobic PS NPs (Fig. 3C) [30]. Given the large
polydispersity, LUVs and smaller PS-monolayer particles likely coexist in the sample. However,
fitting with the Guinier function for accurate particle sizes combined with the power law cannot
yield a satisfactory result, indicating a more complex mixture of different structures in the
sample. Overall, large thin sheets remain, as the power law exponent of 2 suggests, but some of
the sheets are monolayer instead of bilayer. This significant effect can also be seen from NSE
results (Fig. 4). Adding 1% AM or CM to the DMPC change the effective bending modulus of
DMPC bilayer about 20% to 30%, either making the bilayer more rigid or softer, respectively.
However, a large decrease in membrane rigidity happens with 1% PS NPs. The effective bending
changes from 203 ± 8 kBT to 24 ± 2 kBT, almost an order of magnitude smaller. This result
suggests some fundamental changes to the membrane, corroborating the formation of monolayer
indicated by the thickness reduction. The intrinsic bending modulus and the bilayer area
compressibility modulus can be derived from the effective bending modulus; however, they are
based on models of lipid bilayer rather than monolayer. They are presented in the Supporting
Information.

The greater change is likely driven by the hydrophobic nature of PS, which favors interaction
with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The effects of PS NPs, even at low concentrations,
raise concerns about their potential influence on biological membranes. Although the charged
and hydrophilic nature of AM and CA NPs appears to ease some of these effects compared with
the unmodified PS NPs, the observed structural perturbations such as membrane thinning (Fig.
3A) and smaller vesicle formation (Fig. 3B) are still concerning.

3.2. Effect on E. coli lipid membrane
The deuterated E. coli lipid, extracted from cells grown in deuterated media, provides a more
environmentally relevant model membrane system compared with single-component lipid
vesicles. Its complex composition of lipids with varying chain lengths and headgroups

(predominantly negatively charged Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and highly intrinsically curved
Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), with minor components such as Phosphatidic acids,
Phosphatidylserine, and Lyso-PE) reflects the diverse lipid makeup of bacterial membranes. The
ubiquitous distribution of bacteria in the environment offers abundant opportunities for NP
interaction with such membranes. The contrast-matching point of the E. coli lipid was determined
to be about 101.7% D₂O-equivalent, standing out prominently in 26% D2O used for contrast
matching PS.
The LUVs formed from E. coli lipid also exhibit a well-defined unilamellar bilayer, as evidenced
by the low-Q data indicating an extended bilayer thin sheet structure (Fig. 5). In contrast to the
DMPC bilayer, the first minimum between 0.1 and 0.2 Å⁻¹ is less prominent, indicating some
degree of thickness polydispersity originated from its complex composition with lipids of different
chain length. Fitting this region, the lamellar model shows a much thicker bilayer of 41.2 Å with
about 17.5% ± 0.8% thickness polydispersity (Table 2). This result is consistent with its higher
degree of deuteration, including the headgroups and the presence of both long-chain and shortchain lipids [56]. Interestingly, the addition of NPs led to sharper minima around the region,
suggesting a decrease in thickness polydispersity; therefore, the interaction yields a more rigid and
uniform membrane as NPs round up different lipids. At the same time, the addition of NPs reduces
the bilayer thickness for all the samples, as evidenced by the shifts in the positions of the first
minima to higher Q values. This effect was observed even at the lowest NP concentrations tested,
demonstrating the significant influence of both unmodified and surface-modified NPs.

Caillè structure factor is used to combine
with lamellar form factor

The lamellar model fitting results also substantiate this thinning effect. For example, adding AM
reduces the bilayer thickness from 41.2 Å to between about 32 and 37 Å, with no polydispersity
needed to fit the data well. Adding CM and PS NPs reduces the bilayer thickness gradually in a
concentration dependent manner. No halved reduction in the thickness occurs for any of the
samples, unlike in some of DMPC samples. This result indicates that the bilayer structure is
preserved, with no evidence of monolayer formation.
Although most NP additions preserve the unilamellar structure, the addition of 0.5% AM induces
inter-vesicle attraction, evidenced by a prominent peak at Q = 0.1 Å⁻¹ (corresponding to a repeating
spacing of 60.0 Å fitted by Caillè structure factor). This is possible for positively charged AM NPs

to bring negatively charged E. coli bilayer in close proximity (Fig. 3D). Even in the 1% AM
sample, a small shoulder peak can be seen near Q = 0.08 Å⁻¹ on top of the lamellar form factor
(indicated by the arrow in Fig. 5A). However, increasing AM concentration may balance out the
overall charge distribution around the LUVs, so the inter-vesicle aggregation is greatly reduced in
the 1% AM sample and eventually disappears in the 2% AM sample.
At low and medium Q, the changes in E. coli lipid bilayer are also less drastic than in DMPC. The
extended thin sheet with power law exponent of 2 occurs in all the samples. No smaller particles
form, even in the most hydrophobic PS NPs, unlike DMPC.
The complex lipid composition of the E. coli membrane, including charged lipids such as PG and
lipids with high intrinsic curvature such as PE, as well as the diversity in chain lengths and
saturation, appears to partially mitigate the influence of NPs compared with the simpler DMPC
system. However, the membrane thinning in all samples even at low NP concentrations, and intervesicle aggregation in some cases, significantly affect the membranes.
3.3.Implications
This study employed well-defined spherical PS particles. Unmodified, these particles are
highly hydrophobic and quite rigid. Upon surface modification with amine groups, the particles
become more hydrophilic and positively charged, which facilitates interactions with negatively
charged bacterial membranes. Conversely, carboxylated modifications render the particles more
hydrophilic while imparting a negative charge, causing repulsion from bacterial membranes. At
low volume fractions, these particles also exert osmotic pressure in solution [59]. The particle
diameters, around 40–50 nm, fall on the relatively small end of NPs typically found in
environmental contexts. As a model, they can be found at tissue levels and can interact with

membrane-associated proteins such as α-synuclein [9,24]. Thus, they serve as well-controlled
model NPs for understanding membrane interactions.
The membrane systems employed include a basic phospholipid system and a more complex,
biologically relevant membrane, enabling comparison of PS NP interactions under different
conditions. The data reveal significant disturbances in both membrane types at the molecular
level, regardless of NP concentration, charge, or surface modification. Four primary modes of
membrane disruption were identified.
The first, and most prevalent, effect is membrane thinning (Fig. 3A). Although overall vesicle
shape remained unchanged, as observed in several DMPC and E. coli lipid samples, membrane
surface adsorption generated tension that thinned the bilayer considerably [58]. This thinning is
likely to affect membrane rigidity, potentially influencing various membrane-associated
processes (e.g., membrane raft and membrane proteins). The second mode of disruption is
vesicle fragmentation into smaller vesicles. This mode was pronounced at high NP
concentrations, particularly in AM-DMPC samples (Fig. 3B). The third mode involves lipid
monolayer formation induced by interactions with hydrophobic PS NPs (Fig. 3C). Fragmentation
and monolayer formation are both destructive to vesicle and bilayer integrity.
Interestingly, the more biologically relevant E. coli lipid membrane exhibited some degree of
resilience to these destructive effects, showing fewer signs of damage. This result suggests that
membranes composed of a diverse range of lipids—especially with charged lipids and different
chain length, as seen in biological systems—may be more resistant to NP-induced damage.
Nonetheless, the fourth mode of structural alteration—inter-vesicle aggregation—was noted at

some low NP concentrations and poses potential risks in biological contexts. For example,
organelles and transport vesicles within cells could be similarly affected by such aggregation.
These data underscore the potential for NPs to disrupt the delicate balance of biomembrane
functions. The observed structural and dynamic changes may impair membrane rigidity, protein
functions, and vesicular transport. Significant biological consequences could occur, raising
concerns about the environmental and health risks associated with nanoplastics.
The spherical morphology of the NPs used in this study may underestimate the effects that
sharper-edged or irregularly shaped particles might exert on membranes. Additional surface
properties could also exacerbate NP–membrane interactions, and these variables merit further
exploration. Although a standardized approach to nanoplastic studies in this context has not yet
been established, the present work demonstrates the utility of SANS contrast matching and offers
key insights into NP–membrane interactions that are not accessible by other structural techniques
such as cryo-EM [27]. These findings not only advance the understanding of nanoplastics’
potential to cause molecular damage but also lay the groundwork for future investigations into
the biological impacts of environmentally relevant NPs at the molecular level.
