Abstract

40

The tire rubber-derived ozonation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine

41

(6PPD), N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD-Q), was recently

42

discovered to cause acute mortality in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). para-

43

Phenylenediamines (PPDs) with variable side chains distinct from 6PPD have been identified as

44

potential replacement commercial antioxidants, but their structure-related ozone reactivities and

45

toxicities remain unexplored. We herein tested the multiphase gas-surface ozone reactivity of four

46

select PPDs and evaluated the toxicity of their reaction mixtures in coho salmon and rainbow trout

47

(Oncorhynchus mykiss). 6PPD and N-Isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (IPPD) were found

48

to rapidly react with ozone to form 22 and 16 transformation products, respectively, including PPD-

49

Qs. No significant multiphase ozone reactivity was observed for N,N'-Diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine

50

(DPPD) or N-Cyclohexyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (CPPD) despite their structural similarity

51

to 6PPD. The viability of coho salmon CSE-119 cells was strongly affected by the ozonolysis

52

products of 6PPD, but not by those of the other three PPDs. The cytotoxicity of the 6PPD reaction

53

mixture increased with ozonolysis time, with the strongest toxicity being observed after 7 days of

54

oxidation by 100 ppb of ozone. As with coho salmon cells, acute mortality was only observed in

55

juvenile rainbow trout that were exposed to the oxidized 6PPD reaction mixture, suggesting a

56

common mechanism of toxic action in the two salmonid fish species. Compound- and regio-

57

selective formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q were detected in rainbow trout exposed

58

to the 6PPD reaction mixture, which may be related to its selective toxicity. This study reports the

59

structurally selective ozone reactivity of PPDs, and the unique toxicity of 6PPD ozonolysis mixtures,

60

which demonstrates that other PPDs are potential alternative antioxidants.

Introduction

68

Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are one of seven Oncorhynchus fish species native to North

69

America. Importantly, specific coho salmon populations have been declining since the 1970s

70

including four distinct populations that are listed as endangered or threatened (1-3). In urbanized

71

watersheds, 40-90% of returning coho salmon die before spawning, a phenomenon known as

72

‘urban runoff mortality syndrome’ (4). A recent milestone study identified the ozonation product of

73

N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-

74

phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD-Q), as the toxicant responsible for the acute mortality of coho

75

salmon (5). 6PPD-Q exerts extreme toxicity in coho salmon, with a median lethal concentration

76

(LC50) of 0.095 µg/L (6). 6PPD-Q also exerts toxicity to several other salmonid fish species including

77

rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with large interspecies variation in lethality (7-9), but the

78

toxicity mechanism remains unclear. The reaction of 6PPD with atmospheric ozone is generally

79

considered to be the major pathway for the formation of 6PPD-Q. Previous studies demonstrated

80

the generation of 6PPD-Q from homogeneous ozonation of 6PPD in phosphate buffer solution (10),

81

and the heterogeneous gas-phase ozonation of pure solid 6PPD (11) and 6PPD present in tire

82

tread wear particles (12). 6PPD has been widely used as an antioxidant to protect rubber tires from

83

oxidative aging where transport of 6PPD-Q typically occurs from ozonation of tire wear particles

84

and dust that ultimately reach aquatic ecosystems through stormwater runoff (13). Globally,

85

approximately 3.1 billion car tires are manufactured annually, with the United States alone

86

consuming 6PPD in the range of 50 to 100 million pounds each year (14). Not surprisingly, 6PPD-

87

Q and 6PPD have been widely detected in surface waters across Canada and other countries (15-

88

17), underscoring the pervasive exposure to salmonid fish worldwide during freshwater residence.

89

There is a pressing need to develop safe alternative antioxidants to replace 6PPD.

90

The development of alternative antioxidants to 6PPD is challenging for the following reasons: 1) It

91

is not straightforward to identify compounds with greater ozone reactivity than alkene compounds,

92

which is the major component of rubber products (14); 2) The alternative antioxidants must

93

demonstrate excellent diffusivity in rubber to ensure persistent surface protection over time; 3) The

94

toxicities of alternative antioxidants are difficult to predict. Therefore, instead of developing a new

95

class of antioxidants, the ideal case is to further refine the existing PPD compound class to

96

determine less toxic alternatives. Indeed, our recent study reported the selective toxicity of 6PPD-

97

Q amongst seven structural analogues of PPD-Qs (18). However, even though the preliminary

98

results implied the potential for other PPDs to be applied as substitutes of 6PPD, their safety was

99

evaluated for only PPD-quinones. As antioxidants to protect rubber from oxidation, PPDs can be

100

rapidly transformed by ozone to a variety of chemical species. Over 30 structurally diverse

101

transformation products have been reported to form via the reaction of 6PPD with ozone (10, 11).

102

Such chemical complexity in transformation products as well as the high toxicity observed for the

103

major product 6PPD-Q highlights the need to systematically assess the toxicity of all PPD

104

transformation products under environmentally relevant ozone conditions.

105

In this study, we aimed to systematically assess the structure-related ozone reactivity and toxicity

106

of four select PPDs including 6PPD, N-Isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (IPPD), N-

107

Cyclohexyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine

108

(DPPD). These compounds serve as representative PPDs with distinct alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aryl

109

side chains, informing the structure-related effects on ozone reactivity and toxicity of PPDs. In

110

addition, these PPDs are widely employed as commercial antioxidants, making them convenient

111

substitutes for 6PPD if they exhibit reduced toxicity. To achieve this, 1) we conducted multiphase

112

ozonolysis of PPDs using a flow reactor; 2) the structure-related toxicities of PPD ozonolysis

113

mixtures were evaluated in an embryonic coho salmon cell line; 3) the PPD ozonolysis mixtures

114

were dosed to juvenile rainbow trout for in vivo toxicity testing (Fig. 1).

Results and Discussion

117

Multiphase ozonolysis of PPDs. Multiphase gas-surface ozonolysis experiments were performed

118

in a flow reactor to simulate the transformation of PPDs in tire-wear particles when exposed to

119

atmospheric oxidants (10, 11). Preliminary results showed that with a level of 1 ppm of ozone,

120

approximately 60% of 100 µg and 50% of 500 µg of 6PPD were consumed after 24 hours (Fig.

6

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jmptn ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2000-1647 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

121

S1A-B), which represented a notably fast consumption rate. Therefore, we opted to use a more

122

environmentally relevant level of ozone (100 ppb) for the reaction. Under the conditions of a starting

123

mass of 500 µg 6PPD and an ozone concentration of 100 ppb, >50% of 6PPD was oxidized within

124

4 days (Fig. S1C). Thus, the ozonolysis was performed at 100 ppb for a variety of periods (0, 3,

125

and 7 days) to reflect the aging of PPDs under environmentally relevant conditions. Assuming the

126

typical outdoor ozone concentration is ~40 ppb in an urban city (e.g., Toronto, Canada) (19) and

127

the amount of ozone exposure received by film samples in the flow reactor was linearly proportional

128

to exposure time and ozone concentration, then exposure for 3 days and 7 days is equivalent to

129

outdoor exposure times of approximately 1 and 2.5 weeks, respectively. Environmental ozonation

130

of 6PPD for periods of 1-3 weeks are common during the antecedent dry summers experienced in

131

habitats utilized by 6PPD-Q impacted species, and thus this ozonation regime may represent the

132

mixture of transformation products present in urban runoff.

133

As shown in Fig. 2A, a 64.5 ± 2.8% consumption of 6PPD was observed after 7 days of ozone

134

reaction (6PPD7d). Correspondingly, 6PPD-Q was detected as a major transformation product, and

135

its concentration increased along with ozonolysis time. 6PPD-Q was not detected in the negative

136

controls with zero air at the same setting (Fig. S2), clearly demonstrating its formation was due to

137

the reaction with ozone. The oxidation yield of 6PPD-Q at day 7 was 8.4 ± 0.7%, which was

138

comparable to that (10 ± 5%) observed by Zhao et al. (11).

139

To systematically characterize the reaction products of 6PPD, high-resolution mass spectrometry

140

(HRMS)-based nontargeted analysis was employed. Twenty-two LC-MS features were detected

141

as tentative transformation products. These features showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) peak

142

abundances at day 3 and 7 in comparison to day 0 (Fig. 2B), supporting their identities as

143

ozonolysis products. The identities of 4-Hydroxydiphenylamine (4-HDPA) and N-Phenyl-p-

144

phenylenediamine (4-ADPA) were confirmed by their authentic standards. 4-HDPA and 4-ADPA

145

might be formed through the oxidative N-dealkylation of 6PPD, followed by hydrolysis as reported

146

in a previous study (20). Similar to 6PPD-Q, increasing concentrations with ozonolysis time were

147

observed for both 4-HDPA and 4-ADPA (see Fig. S3A-B). The structures of 8 other transformation

148

products were assigned based on their relative retention times to 6PPD and 6PPD-Q, their MS/MS

149

spectra (Fig. S4), and the reaction pathways reported in previous studies (10, 11). For the other 11

150

transformation products, their formulae were suggested according to m/z (Table S2). Additionally,

151

the concentrations of the 19 transformation products without commercial standards were semi-

152

quantified using the standard of 6PPD-Q, giving a total yield of 29.4 ± 5.9% after ozonolysis for 7

153

days (Fig. S3C). All transformation products account for approximately 65% of the 6PPD loss after

154

ozonolysis. Undetectable oligomers and volatile substances might contribute to the remaining

155

transformation products (18). These results demonstrate the formation of multiple structurally

156

diverse transformation products from the ozonolysis of 6PPD.

157

A similar consumption rate of IPPD (55.0 ± 14.8%) was observed after 7 days of ozonolysis (Fig.

158

2A), implying high ozonation potential for IPPD in consumer products. IPPD-Q, 4-ADPA and 4-

159

HDPA were also detected as the transformation products of IPPD, with 7-day reaction yields of

160

6.05 ± 1.59%, 5.54 ± 1.91%, and 0.40 ± 0.17%, respectively (Fig. 2A, S3A, S3B). Nontargeted

161

analysis revealed the formation of 16 tentative transformation products from the ozonolysis of IPPD

162

(Fig. S3C). In addition to IPPD-Q, 4-ADPA and 4-HDPA, five other transformation products shared

163

similar reaction pathways with those of 6PPD (Fig. S5), and 8 transformation products (Table S3)

164

from other pathways were also detected, the total yield of which was 14.6 ± 5.2% (Fig. S3E).

165

In contrast to 6PPD and IPPD with alkyl side chains, no significant oxidative consumption was

166

observed for CPPD or DPPD with cycloalkyl and aryl side chains (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, no

167

significant transformation products were detected from CPPD 7d and DPPD7d using nontargeted

168

analysis, demonstrating the low reactivity of CPPD and DPPD in this heterogeneous phase

169

condition. Collectively, our study demonstrates the highly structure-related ozone reactivity of

170

PPDs. PPDs with alkyl side chains (e.g., IPPD) appear, based on their ozone reactivity, to be more

171

suitable alternative antioxidants to reduce tire aging.

172
173

In vitro toxicity of ozonolysis products of PPDs in the coho salmon CSE-119 cell line. The

174

coho salmon CSE-119 cell line has been reported to be sensitive to 6PPD-Q (21), highlighting its

8

175

suitability as an in vitro model for the toxicity testing of PPD reaction mixtures. The extracts of

176

individual PPD ozonolysis mixtures were dosed to the CSE-119 cell line at various concentrations

177

(0.686-500 µg/L). The cell viability following 48 hours of exposure was measured using an

178

alamarBlue assay. As shown in Figure 3A, toxicity was not observed for any of the four PPDs at

179

day 0 prior to ozonolysis (PPD0d) as their fluorescence remained unchanged compared with the

180

control groups. Strikingly, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed for both 6PPD 3d and

181

6PPD7d in a concentration-dependent manner. For example, a cell viability of 41.1 ± 3.3% was

182

observed at 500 µg/L of 6PPD3d (Fig. 3B), and an even more pronounced decrease in cell viability

183

(32.5 ± 3.8%) was observed for 6PPD7d at the same exposure level (Fig. 3C). The median effective

184

concentration (EC50) of 6PPD7d was calculated to be 213.1 µg/L, which was lower than that of

185

6PPD3d (EC50 = 401.2 µg/L). This clearly demonstrated the increasing toxicity of the 6PPD reaction

186

mixtures with aging. The concentration of 6PPD-Q in the ozonolysis products of 6PPD7d at the EC50

187

(213.1 µg/L) was approximately 17.9 µg/L, which was comparable to the EC50 (19.3 µg/L) of pure

188

6PPD-Q measured under the same exposure conditions (Fig. 3E). These results suggest 6PPD-Q

189

as the primary driver of toxicity in the 6PPD ozonolysis mixture and impacts on the viability of the

190

coho salmon cell line.

191

Interestingly, cytotoxicity was not observed for ozonated CPPD or DPPD, while IPPD7d exerted

192

minor cytotoxicity (<10%) but only at the highest concentration (500 µg/L). The limited cytotoxicity

193

of CPPD or DPPD might be due to their low ozone heterogeneous reactivity as aforementioned.

194

Supporting this, no significant cytotoxicity was observed for the parent CPPD or DPPD under the

195

same exposure conditions (Fig. 3D). The low cytotoxicity of the IPPD reaction mixture was

196

surprising, as many transformation products were also formed from IPPD through similar

197

ozonolysis pathways as 6PPD. To investigate the potential mechanism, we tested the cytotoxicity

198

of pure IPPD-Q, which we synthesized (18). In contrast to the strong cytotoxicity of 6PPD-Q, toxicity

199

was not observed for IPPD-Q even at the highest concentration of 100 µg/L (Fig. 3E) (22). This

200

demonstrated that the low toxicity of the IPPD reaction mixture is attributable to the low intrinsic

201

toxicity of IPPD-Q compared to 6PPD-Q. This was consistent with our previous study wherein acute

202

toxicity in juvenile rainbow trout was only observed for 6PPD-Q amongst seven other tested PPD-

203

Qs including IPPD-Q (18). The results from the coho salmon CSE-119 cell line experiments

204

provided important information: 1) The unique toxicity of 6PPD-Q was observed in both juvenile

205

rainbow trout and coho salmon cells, indicating a common toxic mode of action between the two

206

fish species; 2) Structure-related cytotoxicity was observed in CSE-119, which excluded the

207

impacts of kinetics (e.g., bioaccumulation), and should be attributed to the intrinsic toxicity of 6PPD-

208

Q; 3) Toxicity was not observed for the reaction mixture of IPPD, despite the formation of many

209

transformation products. This demonstrates that other PPD compounds (e.g., IPPD) are potential

210

substitute antioxidants to replace 6PPD.

211
212

96-hour acute toxicity testing of ozonolysis products of PPDs in rainbow trout. Encouraged

213

by the in vitro toxicity results, we tested the in vivo toxicity of the ozonolysis mixtures of four PPDs

214

towards juvenile rainbow trout. Rainbow trout is a commonly used animal model for routine

215

chemical, effluent and surface toxicity testing. Additionally, rainbow trout is a salmonid fish species

216

that has demonstrated a high sensitivity to 6PPD-Q toxicity, even at early life stages (9, 18). The

217

fish exposure experiment followed the standardized test method ‘Biological Test Method: acute

218

lethality test using rainbow trout’ (Report EPS1/RM/9) from Environment and Climate Change

219

Canada (ECCC 1990) (23). The extracts of reaction mixtures of 6PPD were directly dosed to

220

rainbow trout via waterborne exposure at two different nominal concentrations (5.0 and 25 µg/L).

221

These exposure concentrations were selected for two reasons: 1) The concentrations of 6PPD-Q

222

in the reaction mixture were 0.42 and 2.1 µg/L from the 5.0 and 25 µg/L 6PPD7d exposure groups,

223

respectively, which was comparable to the LD50 (0.64 µg/L) of pure 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout under

224

comparable exposure conditions (18). 2) The concentrations of 6PPD in surface waters are typically

225

lower than 1.0 µg/L (15, 17), and thus PPDs may be considered ‘safe’ at environmentally relevant

226

concentration if toxicity is not observed at 25 µg/L.

227

Significant acute toxicity was observed in juvenile rainbow trout exposed to 25 µg/L of 6PPD7d (Fig.

228

4A), the survival rates of rainbow trout continuously decreased with exposure time, which were

229

43.0 ± 20.5%, 20.0 ± 8.2%, 10.0 ± 0% and 10.0 ± 0% after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr, respectively. The

230

survival rate of rainbow trout after exposure to 25 µg/L of 6PPD7d (2.10 µg/L 6PPD-Q) was about

231

43%, which was comparable to the 24 h LC50 (2.08 µg/L) of pure 6PPD-Q in our previous study

232

(15). Acute toxicity was also observed for rainbow trout exposed to 25 µg/L of 6PPD3d, albeit with

233

lesser toxicity (e.g., 53.0 ± 12.5% survival rate at 96 hr) than 6PPD7d. Toxicity was also observed

234

at 5.0 µg/L of 6PPD7d group, but with a higher survival rate of 96.0 ± 4.7% after 96 hr of exposure.

235

In contrast to oxidized 6PPD, toxicity in rainbow trout was not observed for 6PPD0d prior to

236

ozonolysis. This demonstrated that the toxicity of reaction mixtures of 6PPD increased along with

237

aging time, which aligned with the results obtained from the in vitro coho salmon cell exposures.

238

Interestingly, acute toxicity was not observed in rainbow trout exposed to the reaction mixtures of

239

the three other PPDs (Fig. 3B-D), despite their very similar structures to 6PPD. Although one fish

240

was found dead for one of the three replicates of the 5.0 µg/L of CPPD3d exposure, this should not

241

be attributed to the intrinsic toxicity of CPPD, as toxicity was not observed at higher exposure

242

concentrations (25 µg/L) or at longer exposure times. Collectively, for the first time, we have

243

demonstrated the structurally selective toxicity of ozonated 6PPD, which contrasted with IPPD,

244

CPPD and DPPD, under environmentally relevant ozonolysis conditions. Up to 25 µg/L exposure

245

concentrations were used in the current study which were well above the concentrations of 6PPD

246

in surface waters (15-17). This demonstrated that IPPD may not cause significant acute toxicity

247

towards rainbow trout if used as replacement antioxidants under similar production volumes.

248

However, the toxicity of CPPD and DPPD transformation products remains unclear, as neither

249

appeared to react with ozone under the experimental conditions assessed.

250
251

Bioaccumulation of PPDs and their transformation products in rainbow trout. Fourteen of 22

252

transformation products, and 14 of 16 transformation products were detected in the whole fish body

253

for 6PPD and IPPD after the exposure experiments, respectively (Fig. 5, S7-12). Eight of the

254

transformation products were detected in both IPPD and 6PPD treatment groups, including PPD-

255

Qs. The concentrations of 6PPD-Q in the fish body increased with ozonolysis time, with the highest

concentrations detected in the fish body exposed to 6PPD7d (Fig. 5B, S7B, S8). 6PPD-Q was

detected in a dose-dependent manner, at 2.01 ± 0.44 and 16.8 ± 5.72 ng/g ww in the fish body

258

exposed to 5.0 and 25 µg/L of 6PPD7d, respectively. These results confirm the bioaccumulation of

259

6PPD-Q in fish following exposure to water dosed with the 6PPD ozonolysis mixtures. IPPD-Q was

260

also detected in the fish body exposed to IPPD reaction mixtures, at slightly lower (2-5 times)

261

concentrations than 6PPD-Q. CPPD-Q was also detected in the fish body, which might be due to

262

the impurity of CPPD-Q in CPPD standard, as we also detected CPPD-Q with very low percentage

263

(~0.3%) in the ozonolysis mixture of CPPD0d. Unexpectedly, DPPD-Q was detected in fish exposed

264

to the reaction mixtures of DPPD; it was not detected as a product in the ozonolysis reaction

265

mixtures, as mentioned above. This might be attributed to the oxidation of DPPD by enzymatic or

266

aerobic means, since DPPD-Q was also detected from DPPD0d prior to ozonolysis at similar

267

concentrations. Taken these results together, PPD-Qs were detected in fish body at concentrations

268

of 0.61 to 16.8 ng/g ww after exposure to the reaction mixtures of PPDs (Fig. 5B, S7B). The toxicity

269

of 6PPD7d towards both coho salmon cells and rainbow trout fish (18) was similar to that of pure

270

6PPD-Q at the same concentration. From these two pieces of evidence we conclude that 6PPD-Q

271

is the major driver of the selective toxicity of the ozonolysis products of 6PPD.

272

The co-occurrence of 6PPD-Q and its structurally similar transformation products in the same

273

reaction mixture provided an opportunity to identify the key toxicity moieties. For example, high

274

concentrations of 4-HDPA were detected in fish body exposed to all PPDs, except for the DPPD

275

exposure group, at even higher concentrations than their parent PPDs (Fig. 5D, S7D). Note that

276

the concentrations of 4-HDPA were lower than those of 4-ADPA and PPD-Qs in the ozonolysis

277

mixtures of 6PPD and IPPD (Fig. S3A-B). Thus, the high concentrations of 4-HDPA were probably

278

due to the hydrolysis of PPDs via biotic or abiotic processes. The concentrations of 4-HDPA from

279

both the IPPD and CPPD treatment groups were much higher than those of 6PPD, which clearly

12

280

demonstrated that 4-HDPA does not cause acute toxicity in rainbow trout, despite its high

281

concentrations.

282

Not surprisingly, parent PPDs were detected in the fish body at relatively high concentrations (Fig.

283

5A, S7A). DPPD, in particular, was detected at greater than 10-times higher concentrations in

284

rainbow trout compared to the three alkyl-PPDs (Fig. 5A). This should not be attributed to

285

hydrophobicity as the logKOW of DPPD (4.04, calculated by EPI Suite) is comparable to or lower

286

than those of 6PPD (4.68), IPPD (3.28) and CPPD (4.64). Instead, slow hydrolysis of DPPD to 4-

287

HDPA might partially explain its high bioaccumulation, considering that 4-HDPA was detected at

288

low concentrations in the DPPD treatment groups. However, toxicity was not observed at day 0 for

289

any PPDs prior to ozonolysis, indicating that parent PPDs are unlikely to be acutely lethal despite

290

10-100 times higher concentrations than 6PPD-Q.

291

Collectively, the results demonstrated that 6PPD-Q drives the selective toxicity of the 6PPD

292

reaction mixture. While a variety of ozonolysis products were detected in fish bodies, our data

293

indicate that other products did not contribute to acute toxicity of the reaction mixture. This

294

demonstrates the unique intrinsic toxicity of 6PPD-Q, and that minor structural modifications on the

295

middle quinone ring or side alkyl chain can completely remove its acute toxicity (Scheme 1).

296
297

Compound- and regio-selective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q. Intrigued by the selective toxicity of

298

6PPD-Q, we decided to investigate the structure-related metabolism of 6PPD-Q and other

299

ozonolysis products. More than 11,000 LC-MS features were detected, among them 109 features

300

with >10-time higher signal intensity (p < 0.05) from 25 µg/L of 6PPD7d compared to 6PPD0d

301

(negative controls). We focused on high-abundance features with signal intensity greater than

302

1×106. Surprisingly, only three LC-MS features were identified as tentative metabolites in positive

303

mode, including m/z = 315.1699 (RT = 5.89 min), m/z = 315.1702 (RT = 6.36 min), and m/z =

304

331.1649 (RT= 5.18 min) (Fig. 6A). The two features at m/z = 315.1699 and m/z = 315.1702, were

305

assigned as the alkyl and aryl hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q, i.e. 6PPD-Q-OH (alkyl-OH)

306

and 6PPD-Q-OH (aryl-OH) (C18H22N2O3), respectively. Their identities were clearly supported by

13

307

the detection of multiple diagnostic MS2 fragments (Fig. S13 A and B); the detection of regio-

308

selective 6PPD-Q-OH isomers was consistent with our previous study (18). The feature at m/z =

309

331.1649 (RT = 5.18 min) was assigned as C18H22N2O4 with a mass error of 0.91 ppm. The MS2

310

spectrum indicated this feature as di-hydroxylated 6PPD-Q (6PPD-Q-Di-OH), with hydroxylation on

311

both the aromatic ring and alkyl side chain (Fig. S13C). This is the first report of the formation of a

312

di-hydroxylated metabolite of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout. Due to the lack of authentic standards, we

313

used 6PPD-Q to semi-quantify 6PPD-Q-OH isomers and 6PPD-Q-Di-OH. The total concentrations

314

of the hydroxylated 6PPD-Qs were 2 to 5 times higher than those of 6PPD-Q (Fig. 6B) (18). These

315

results demonstrate the rapid hydroxylation and di-hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout.

316

Surprisingly, despite the presence of >20 ozonolysis products of 6PPD, metabolites in the fish body

317

were not detected for any of these products through nontargeted analysis. To verify this, we

318

manually inspected for the hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD and the other ozonolysis products by

319

using their predicted chemical formulae ([M+O]). Hydroxylated metabolites were only detected for

320

6PPD at ~10 times relative abundance lower than 6PPD-Q-OH, despite the 10 to 100 times higher

321

body concentration of 6PPD compared to 6PPD-Q. This was surprising as 6PPD is notably more

322

electron-rich than 6PPD-Q, and thus is predicted to be more prone to undergo oxidative

323

hydroxylation. This demonstrated that the compound-selective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q should be

324

attributed to the high substrate selectivity of the related enzyme, rather than its chemical reactivity.

325

We then attempted to identify the metabolites of the ozonolysis products of IPPD. Two LC-MS

326

features were detected as tentative metabolites at m/z = 273.1231 (ESI+) and m/z = 351.0654 (ESI-

327

) (Fig. S14A-B). By collecting MS1 and MS2 spectra (Fig. S14C), these two metabolites were

328

assigned as IPPD-Q-OH (aryl-OH) and sulfated IPPD-Q, respectively. The metabolism of IPPD-Q

329

was clearly distinct from 6PPD-Q, in which no alkyl-hydroxylated metabolites were detected (Fig.

330

S14D). Similarly, nontargeted analysis was employed to detect the metabolites in rainbow trout

331

after exposure to ozonolysis mixtures of CPPD and DPPD. While hydroxylated metabolites of

14

332

CPPD were detected at minor levels which were 10-100 times lower than those of parent CPPD,

333

no hydroxylated products were detected from the DPPD group (Fig. S15).

334

Overall, we herein discovered the highly compound- and regio-selective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q

335

in rainbow trout: 1) 6PPD-Q showed rapid compound-selective hydroxylation compared to 6PPD

336

and 4-HDPA; 2) 6PPD-Q showed regio-selective hydroxylation on the alkyl side chain, in contrast

337

to IPPD-Q (Fig. 6C). Future studies are warranted to confirm if the regio- and compound-selective

338

hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q contributes to the selective toxicity of the ozonolysis products of 6PPD.

339
340

Conclusions. The extremely selective toxicity of the 6PPD ozonolysis mixtures was surprising

341

given the very similar structure of 6PPD relative to the other three PPDs. All evidence indicates

342

that the selective toxicity of the 6PPD ozonolysis-reaction mixture arises from the unique intrinsic

343

toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Notably, the structure-related toxicity of the mixture was observed in both the

344

coho salmon cell line and rainbow trout fish, indicating a common toxic mechanism of action across

345

the two species. While the exact toxicity mechanism remains unknown, the unique compound- and

346

regio-selective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q indicates that enzymatic bioactivation of the compound

347

may partially contribute to its toxicity. Future studies are warranted to thoroughly investigate the

348

potential role of hydroxylated metabolites and to elucidate the exact toxicity mechanism.

349

Identifying substitute antioxidants for the replacement of 6PPD is an urgent need. While our recent

350

study pinpointed the potential to use of other PPDs as safer 6PPD substitutes, only PPD-Qs were

351

tested for toxicity (18). The present study is the first to systematically evaluate the toxicity of the

352

ozonolysis products of 6PPD under environmentally relevant oxidation conditions. Importantly,

353

toxicity was not observed for the IPPD ozonolysis mixture, despite the formation of many

354

transformation products that were similar in structure to 6PPD-Q. These results are highly

355

encouraging and support the potential to use novel PPDs as substitutes for 6PPD. However, future

studies are warranted to further test the toxicity of PPDs ozonolysis in more animal species (e.g.,

357

in vivo coho salmon testing).

361

Chemicals and Reagents. The standards used in this study are listed in Table S1. Solvents and

362

reagents used for sample extraction and mobile phases including acetonitrile, methanol, and formic

363

acid were liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade and purchased from Thermo

364

Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, United States). Anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na 2SO4, purity of >

365

99%), Resazurin sodium salt, and Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline were bought from Sigma-

366

Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Sodium Chloride (NaCl, purity of > 99.5%) was purchased from

367

Bioshop (Burlington, ON, Canada). C18 was purchased from Waters (Mississauga, ON, Canada).

368

Reagents and media used for the cell cultures, such as Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL),

369

Gibco Fetal Bovine Serum, Leibovitz’s (1X) (L-15 Medium), 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (1X), were also

372

Ozonolysis of PPD Surface Film in a Flow Reactor. The ozonolysis experiment was conducted

373

in a cylindrical quartz flow reactor with Teflon flanges. The reactor was placed in a metall box to

374

block natural light from the room. The ozonolysis experiments were carried out at room temperature

375

(~295 K), and relative humidity (RH) was maintained at 45-50% inside the flow reactor. The

376

experimental conditions and setup were adapted from our previous study (24). To simulate an

377

atmospherically-relevant ozone condition, the ozone mixing ratio in the flow reactor was maintained

378

at 100 ppb. A total of 2.0 L/min airflow was sent to the flow reactor: specifically, 10 cubic centimeter

379

per minute (ccm) zero air passed through an ozone generator that was composed of a quartz cell

380

and a Pen−Ray lamp, 1.0 L/min humidified zero air flow passed through a bubbler filled with distilled

381

water, and 1.0 L/min dry zero air flowed directly to the flow reactor. At the outlet flow, the ozone

382

mixing ratio and RH were monitored by an UV photometric ozone analyzer (Thermo Scientific,

383

Model 49C, USA) and a hygrometer (Vaisala, USA), respectively.

384

The ozonolysis of select PPDs (6PPD, IPPD, CPPD, and DPPD) was performed individually in the

385

form of surface films. Each PPD film sample was deposited on a circular cover glass slide (25 mm

386

diameter, Fisher Scientific) by covering the glass slide with a 130 μL aliquot of 5.0 mg/mL PPD in

387

acetone and waiting for full solvent evaporation in ambient air (~3 minutes). The PPD film samples

388

were then transferred to the flow reactor for ozone exposure (100 ppb) for 3 and 7 days to simulate

389

different atmospheric ozone exposure scenarios. Triplicates were prepared for each time point.

390

Then, each film sample was extracted with 2.6 mL HPLC-grade acetonitrile (250 mg/L of PPD0d-7d

391

mixtures), 0.5 mL of which was further diluted to a final concentration of 50 mg/L with acetonitrile.

392

0-day film samples were extracted immediately after solvent evaporation with minimal ambient

393

ozone exposure (< 5 min). Zero air control samples for each PPD were also collected under the

394

same exposure periods and flow conditions, except for turning the Pen-Ray lamp on for ozone

395

supply. The ozone mixing ratio was below 2 ppb during control experiments. The extracted

396

solutions were stored at -80 °C until LC-HRMS analysis.

Fish Source and Culture. The rainbow trout experiments were conducted in the Ontario Ministry

399

of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP, Scarborough ON, Canada) Laboratory

400

Services Branch. Eggs of rainbow trout were purchased from Lyndon Fish Hatcheries (New

401

Dundee, ON, Canada). The culturing of rainbow trout was the same as outlined in our previous

402

study (18). After being hatched from eggs, fish were cultured under flow-through conditions at 15

403

± 1 °C for six weeks before exposure experiments. Daily monitoring and feeding with a commercial

404

fish feed at a daily rate of 1% of body weight were administered.

(Report EPS1/RM/9) from Method Development and Applications Section, Environmental

410

Technology Centre, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC 1990) (23). Organism

411

health, technician proficiency and environmental conditions were confirmed before the exposure

412

experiment and monthly during the experimental process using reference tests with potassium

413

chloride (KCl) (ECCC 1990). All experimental protocols were approved by the University of Toronto

414

Animal Care and Use Committee.

415

Exposures of rainbow trout were conducted in buckets lined with food-grade polyethylene

416

disposable liners, which contained 20 L dechlorinated water and 10 rainbow trout, maintained at

417

15 ± 1 °C in a temperature-controlled room. The exposure media was continuously aerated through

418

compressed air bubbled through air stones directly into each vessel to maintain consistent

419

dissolved oxygen (DO) levels between replicates. Fluorescent lighting was maintained between

420

100-500 lux on a 16:8 Light:Dark cycle. For each PPD group, two concentrations (5.0 and 25 µg/L)

421

of oxidized PPD at three ozonolysis time points (0 d, 3 d, 7 d) were tested, by adding 2 mL of

422

ozonolysis mixture of PPD (250 mg/L and 50 mg/L) into 20 L dechlorinated water. For each

423

exposure concentration and each ozonation time point, three replicates were performed. The

424

number of fish mortalities was recorded and temperature was confirmed daily. During the 96 hr

425

exposure experiments, the dead fish were taken out from the exposure containers every 24 hr and

426

preserved at -80 °C. After 96 hr, the fish surviving from the exposure and control groups were

427

euthanized using CO2 in water and kept at -80 °C until analysis.

428
429

Cell Viability Assay. Cellular metabolic activity was tested to determine viability using alamarBlue

430

cell viability reagent (21), which was prepared by dissolving Resazurin sodium salt in phosphate

431

buffered saline at a concentration of 0.30 mg/mL, which was passed through a sterilizing filter (0.22

432

µm) and stored at -20 °C in darkness. One day before exposure, CSE-119 cells were seeded in a

433

96-well plate with a density of 10,000 cells/well in 100 µL of culture media. Exposure media was

434

prepared with PPDs ozonolysis mixtures dosed in fresh culture media. Then, media in 96-well

435

plates were replaced with 100 µL of seven 3-fold serial diluted exposure media (0.686 to 500 µg/L).

436

The percentage of acetonitrile in the culture media was less than 0.2%, and acetonitrile at this

437

percentage did not influence cell viability. There were 12 replicates for each concentration. After

438

48 hours at 20 °C, 10 µL of alamarBlue cell viability reagent was added to each well in a dark room,

439

then the cells were incubated for 4 h at 20°C in darkness. After that, fluorescence was recorded

440

with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 600 nm by a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro M Plex Microplate

441

Reader (Tecan Life Sciences, Switzerland). Cell viability was calculated as the measured

442

fluorescence value at each well compared with that of the solvent control from the same plate. Cell

443

viability of pure PPDs and PPD-Qs was also tested by the same method.

Sample Preparation.

446

PPD/O3 mixtures. After extraction by acetonitrile, the ozonolysis mixtures of PPD were diluted until

447

the concentrations of PPD0d, PPD3d, and PPD7d reached 100 µg/L, and 6PPD-Q-d5 was added at

448

a final concentration of 10 µg/L. Subsequently, they were subjected to LC-HRMS analysis.

449

Fish samples. The pretreatment method of fish samples was similar to our previous study with

450

minor modification (18). Briefly, 300 mg of NaCl was weighed into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and a

451

whole fish was transferred to the tube after thawing. The wet weight of fish was recorded. The fish

452

body was homogenized (n = 3), and 12 ng of 6PPD-Q-d5 was added (for the recovery experiment

453

for method validation, 24 ng of standard mixtures were added simultaneously). Following a 1 hr

454

equilibration period, 300 μL of H2O and 600 μL of acetonitrile were introduced, and the samples

455

were vortexed for 1 min. Each sample underwent 20 min of shaking, 20 min of sonication, and

456

subsequently was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 x g. After delicate transfer of the supernatant to

457

a new 1.5 mL tube, another 600 μL of acetonitrile was used to repeat the extraction. The

458

supernatants were consolidated, and subsequently, 3.6 mg of C 18 and 40 mg of Na2SO4 were

459

introduced to remove lipids and dry the organic extracts. Following a 1 min vortex, the combined

460

extracts underwent centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was transferred

461

to a new amber glass vial for LC-HRMS analysis. The recoveries of PPDs and their transformation

products (n = 15) were satisfactory, which were 75.4 ± 8.9% ~ 126.4 ± 3.1%, meeting the

463

requirements for quantification (Fig. S6).

LC-HRMS Analysis. The samples were measured by a Q Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer

466

(MS) equipped with a Vanquish ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system

467

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Chemical separation was carried out using a C 18 column (50 mm

468

× 2.1 mm, 1.5 μm), which was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA, and 2 µL of each

469

sample was injected. The temperature of the auto-sampler was kept at 4 °C, while the temperature

470

of the column chamber was held at 40 °C. The mobile phases were composed of 0.1% formic acid

471

in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (B). The gradient elution was performed as follows:

472

0 – 1.5 min, 5.0% B; 3.5 min, 50% B; 7.5 – 11.0 min, 100% B; 11.2 – 12.0 min, 5.0% B, and

473

operated at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min.

474

The scan mode involved a combination of a full MS1 scan followed by subsequent data-independent

475

acquisition (DIA) scans. The full MS1 scan covered the m/z range of 100 to 900 at a resolution (R)

476

of 70,000 (at m/z = 200), facilitating the collection of a maximum of 1 × 106 ions within 60 ms. In

477

both negative and positive modes, two DIA tandem MS (MS/MS) scans were established by

478

covering the m/z ranges of 100 to 500 and 500 to 900, respectively. The DIA scan had an isolation

479

window of 20 m/z; other parameters included a resolution (R) of 35,000 (at m/z = 200), an AGC

480

target of 1×105, and a maximum ionization time of 50 ms. The parameters specified in the tune file

481

were as follows: a spray voltage of 2.8 kV, a sheath gas flow rate of 30 L/hr, an auxiliary gas flow

482

rate of 7 L/hr, and a capillary temperature of 300 °C.

Nontargeted Analysis. Nontargeted analysis was performed using our previously developed in-

485

house algorithm (25, 26). The first step involved transforming the raw mass spectrometry files into

486

an “.mzXML” format; after this, the features in the data files were identified after running an R

487

package (27). To investigate the transformation products in ozonolysis mixtures of PPDs, the

488

features in each PPD7d were contrasted with those found in PPD0d. Those features with significantly

489

(p < 0.05) higher (fold change > 5) signal intensity were selected and further analyzed. Likewise,

490

the features identified in fish body were also examined. Features with signal intensity higher than

491

1x106 and those exhibiting 10-fold significantly higher (p < 0.05) signal intensity in 25 µg/L of PPD7d

492

in comparison with those in fish body after exposure to 25 µg/L of PPD0d were chosen for analysis,

493

as the abundant metabolites suggested a substantial role in both toxicity and bioaccumulation. The

494

chemical formulae were predicted using the Xcalibur Qual Browser software (Thermofisher

495

Software Version 4.1) after inputting the m/z of the feature within the mass tolerance of 5 ppm and

496

specifying the type and number isotopes (12C: 6 – 40; 1H: 5 – 50; 16O: 0 – 10; 14N: 0 – 10; 32S: 0 –

497

4). The chemical structures of the identified peaks were proposed by three methods as follows: 1)

498

For those chemicals with commercially available standards, the structures of the identified features

499

were confirmed by comparing the retention times and corresponding MS/MS fragments with

500

purchased standards; 2) For chemicals with the same formulae as compounds from the published

501

literatures, their structures were proposed by comparing their retention times on a C 18 column

502

relative to PPD and PPD-Q, along with MS2 fragments reported in previous studies; 3) For other

503

identified peaks, chemical structures were hypothesized by analyzing the MS2 fragments. The

504

concentrations of transformation products from the 6PPD0d-7d and the metabolites from fish after

505

exposure to 6PPD0d-7d were semi-quantified by using the standards of 6PPD-Q and 6PPD-Q-d5.

506

The concentrations of transformation products from the IPPD 0d-7d and the metabolites from fish

507

after exposure to IPPD0d-7d were semi-quantified by using the standards of IPPD-Q and 6PPD-Q-

508

Quality Control and Quality Assurance. During the ozonolysis process, zero air control samples

511

were also included by using the same chamber with the O3 concentration held lower than 2 ppb, to

512

confirm that the transformation of PPDs was induced by O 3. A solvent control exposure group (n =

513

3) was included into the rainbow trout exposure experiment, wherein 2 mL of pure acetonitrile was

514

spiked. Additionally, another control group (n = 3) of rainbow trout exposure to pure dechlorinated

515

water was included, in which the weight and length were determined at the end of the 96-hr

exposure. It was confirmed that that the size of fish met the standard method criteria (ECCC 1990).

517

In the dechlorinated water and solvent controls for all exposures the survival criteria of ≤10%

518

mortality was met (Figure 4). During the process of fish samples preparation, procedure blanks

519

were also included without fish to monitor for possible background contamination. While processing

520

the LC-HRMS analysis, standard mixtures were injected after every 15 samples to check the

521

stability of the instrument. Methanol was also injected after every 15 samples to assess potential

522

carry over. The calibration curve, ranging from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL, showed a high linear regression

523

coefficient (R2 > 0.99) for each chemical. 6PPD-Q-d5 was used as the internal standard over the

524

course of quantification. The recoveries of PPDs and transformation products were in the range of

525

75.4 ± 8.9% to 126.4 ± 3.1% (Fig.S6). Method detection limits (MDLs) were determined based on

526

the 99% confidence level of the y-intercept divided by the slope of the calibration curve, which was

527

0.10 – 1.0 ng/mL in PPD/O3 mixtures and water samples, and 0.522 – 1.30 ng/g in fish body.

Statistical Analyses. Statistical analyses were carried out primarily using GraphPad Prism

530

(v10.1.2, GraphPad software Inc, Boston, MA, USA) (28) and R studio (v4.2.1, RStudio, Inc.,

531
