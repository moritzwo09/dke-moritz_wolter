1. Abstract
With rising atmospheric CO2 levels, carbon dioxide capture through calcium carbonate
(CaCO3) precipitation offers a viable pathway for permanent CO2 storage and the production
of useful industrial materials. This study presents the experimental implementation of selective
CaCO3 precipitation from multi-ion solutions in a semi-batch operation. The objective is to
develop and further implement an autonomous control strategy for the selective precipitation
using mine wastes. Two distinct pH control strategies were developed and evaluated: a pH
swing approach and a pH constant approach. Both methods prove effective for the precipitation
of CaCO3 selectively from different multi-ion solutions rich in Mg2+. The two strategies,
however, differ in their precipitation mechanisms. The pH swing method induced rapid
nucleation under high supersaturation, producing fine particles predominantly with Calcite
morphology. In contrast, the constant-pH method allowed for a slower, controlled growth
following initial nucleation, resulting in larger particles with a well-defined bimodal particle
size distribution (PSD). Initial development of the strategies done using model solutions that
mimics real mine tailing extraction solutions and later validated with actual tailing extraction
solutions. Depending on the target particle size, morphology, and process control requirements,
either approach can be tailored for specific applications.

2. Introduction
Calcium carbonate is a versatile and indispensable material in numerous industries [1]. It plays
a critical role in construction as a key component for cement and lime, in agriculture as a soil
conditioner, as a filler in the paper industry, as a calcium source, and as an inert filler in
pharmaceuticals [2], [3], [4]. Solid CaCO3 can be achieved through various methods, including
mining natural sources and through synthetic processes such as the carbonation of lime [5], [6].
However, the precipitation of CaCO3 has emerged as a prominent method for producing highpurity CaCO3 tailored for specific industrial applications [7], [8]. The precipitation of calcium
carbonate involves controlled chemical reactions to transform dissolved calcium ions into solid
carbonate, capturing atmospheric CO2 through carbon mineralization [9]. This method is
particularly attractive because it utilizes calcium-rich industrial wastes and mine tailings,
offering a sustainable approach to resource recovery, separation, and utilization [10]. Calcium
is available in natural minerals as silicates, mostly Augite (CaMgSi2O6 + Fe, Al) and

Wollastonite (CaSiO3). In addition, many industrial wastes like ashes, rich in calcium can be
used as feedstocks for mineral carbonation [11].
Controlled selective precipitation of CaCO3 is particularly critical while dealing with mine
tailings or waste solutions containing a variety of dissolved ions along with the needed calcium
ions. For example, waste solutions from mine tailings and industrial effluents often contain a
3+
2+
variety of dissolved ions such as sulphate (SO2−
4 ), iron (Fe ), magnesium (Mg ), manganese
2+
3−
(Mn ), and phosphate (PO4 ), which can interfere with the selective precipitation of CaCO3
[12], [13], [14] [15]. For the precipitated CaCO3 to be used as raw material for the
abovementioned purposes, selectively precipitating pure CaCO3 from such multicomponent
systems is a critical challenge. The optimal control of the precipitation process depends on
precisely regulating various parameters to ensure process efficiency and product quality. The
key factors influencing the process include pH, ion concentration, and mixing conditions [16].
Calcium ion extraction is preferred at low pH conditions by use of acids, while carbonate
precipitation is more favoured at higher pH conditions [17]. Maintaining an alkaline pH
(typically 8.5 to 10.5) is critical, as it promotes the conversion of dissolved CO2 into carbonate
and bicarbonate ions, facilitating CaCO3 precipitation [18]. However, excessively high pH can
lead to the co-precipitation of other compounds, necessitating careful monitoring and
adjustment [19].
In this study we implemented a semi-batch mode of operation for the selective precipitation of
CaCO3 from a mixture solution of various ions. Semi-batch operation is a preferred mode for
controlled precipitation due to its ability to provide gradual and precise addition of reactants.
This approach ensures uniform mixing and prevents localized supersaturation, which could
result in undesired by-products or inconsistent crystal properties. For instance, [20] investigated
semi-batch processes for calcium oxalate precipitation, highlighting the advantages of precise
reactant addition and enhanced control over crystal growth. Similarly, studies on barium
sulphate [21] and magnesium carbonate precipitation [22] have demonstrated the efficacy of
semi-batch operation in achieving uniform particle size distribution and desired crystal
morphologies. CaCO3 also exhibits three main morphologies: Calcite, Vaterite, and Aragonite.
Several factors, such as the reaction rate, pH, ion concentration, temperature, and impurities,
influence the morphology of the crystals. For e.g., presence of impurities such as magnesium
in the solution favour Vaterite and Calcite [23], while potassium favours needle like structured
Aragonite [24]. Similarly, Calcite is favoured in alkaline pH ranges [25], while acidic
conditions may favour Vaterite and Aragonite [23]. In these previous studies, the precipitation
of the CaCO3 was implemented by directly mixing two solutions, one a source of Ca, such as
CaCl2, while the other solution is rich in CO2−
3 ions, such as Na2CO3 [26]. Due to the very low
solubility of CaCO3, it would precipitate without the need for pH regulation. However, while
tailing solutions are used to produce CaCO3, other impurities could be co-precipitated [27]. So,
the pH regulation via the semi-batch mode not only helps with the controlled selective
precipitation of CaCO3, but the rate of precipitation is also beneficial in influencing the phase
of the precipitate crystals.
The controlled precipitation of CaCO3 is a critical step in developing an autonomous process
control chain, particularly when using complex and variable feedstocks such as mine tailings.
These feedstocks fluctuate in ion content, composition, and pH, which can significantly
influence nucleation, crystal growth, and the morphology of the precipitated CaCO3. High
concentrations of Ca2+ ions and impurities, and increase in the pH result in higher
supersaturation facilitating nucleation [26]. Thus, an autonomous control of the precipitation

process offers an optimal control of the precipitation process ensuring consistent product quality
and operational efficiency in industrial applications. Variability in tailings and waste streams
can lead to inconsistent CaCO3 formation, reducing process efficiency and increasing
operational costs. By integrating process modelling with an autonomous control chain, we can
dynamically adjust operational parameters to maintain optimal precipitation conditions and
produce high-purity CaCO3 in a reliable and cost-effective manner.
The study aimed to develop optimal control strategies for creating an autonomous process chain
for the selective precipitation of CaCO3 using a complex solution mixture of different species.
Two optimal strategies were developed and compared for the optimal control of the
precipitation process, focusing on enhancing efficiency and selectivity. Also, the particle size
distribution (PSD), the morphology, and the precipitation phenomenon of CaCO3 crystals were
analysed for the two optimal control strategies. Furthermore, the impact of foreign ions and
impurities on the precipitation process in a model solution containing known species such as
Mg2+, etc, was analysed. Additionally, the research demonstrated that the developed profiles
could be applied to extraction solutions from actual mine tailings, showcasing their potential to
selectively precipitate CaCO3 with high purity, offering a practical approach for resource
recovery in mining operations.

3. Theory
The implementation of the pH-swing method for the selective precipitation of CaCO3 in a
complex multi-ion mixture solution is governed by the dependency of the solubility of CaCO3
on the pH. Calcium carbonate precipitation occurs when Ca²⁺ ions react with CO2−
3 ions
dissociated from dissolved atmospheric CO2:
Ca2+ + CO2−
3 → CaCO3

(1)

For the CaCO3 formed to be precipitated, its concentration in the solution should exceed the
solubility factor (K sp ), which is defined by the product of the ion activity coefficients at
equilibrium [28]:
K sp = [Ca2+ ]sat [CO2−
3 ]sat

(2)

The K sp of CaCO3 at 25°C in water (at pH 7) is 4.8×10-9 [29]. The equilibrium conditions are
altered due to the changes in pH, temperature, or ion concentration. When the concentrations
of Ca2+ and CO2−
3 exceed the saturation limits, the solution is supersaturated. Thus, the
supersaturation ratio (σ), which is the driving force for precipitation, is defined as [26]:
[Ca2+ ][CO2−
3 ]
(3)
σ=
K sp
This Equation reveals that when the ion activity product exceeds K sp (the ion activity product
at equilibrium), CaCO3 precipitates. The supersaturation ratio (σ) is crucial also because its
values dictate the phenomenon through which the precipitation process will progress. The
precipitation could occur through the primary nucleation, where a large number of nuclei are
born spontaneously. This birth phenomenon occurs when the supersaturation ratios are very
high and birth rate, B is empirically defined in terms of σ as [30]:
B = k b (σ − 1)n

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vqllg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-3445-6405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

(4)

where k b is the rate constant, and n is the exponential factor. Primary nucleation via birth is a
very complex and spontaneous process and is difficult to control. Several previous studies have
tried to estimate experimentally the birth rates and found the values of n to be in the range of 8
- 9, and the value of k b to be around 5.5*10-9 [31].
The precipitation phenomenon could also progress through growth when the value of σ is not
too high [30]. This is a slower process where the excess CaCO3 from the solution attaches to
the surfaces of the existing nuclei, and the overall size of the crystals increases. The growth rate
G, is calculated as [30]:
G = k g (σ − 1)g

(5)

where k g is the growth constant, and g is the exponential constant depending on the growth
mechanism (generally between 1 and 2) [30].
From Equation (3), we also see that the precipitation amount depends not only on the Ca2+ ion
concentration but also on the availability of CO2−
3 ions, which is heavily influenced by the pH.
2The availability of CO3 ions is determined by the equilibrium of dissolved carbon dioxide CO2
in water, which undergoes a series of reactions:
KH

K1

K2

CO2 + H2 O ↔ H2 CO3 ↔ H + + HCO3− ↔ 2H + + CO2−
3

(6)

where KH is the Henry constant for CO2 dissolution in water, while K1 and K2 are the first and
the second dissociation constants for H2CO3, respectively. The values for the constants are
detailed in Table 1.
Table 1: Reaction equilibrium constants at 25 °C [32], [33]

0.0034 mol/L

K2
Thus, the concentration of the total dissolved carbonates (CT ) is:
2−
CT = H2 CO3 + HCO−
3 + CO3

(7)

Under steady-state conditions, the different carbonate species are at equilibrium depending on
the solution pH [34]. From Equation (6) & (7), the equilibrium concentration of CO23 ions can
be expressed as:
[CO2−
3 ]=

CT K1 K 2
+
2
[H ] + K1 [H + ] + K1 K 2

(8)

where [H+] is the proton concentration and the driving force for the pH regulation. This
relationship explains the influence of pH on the supersaturation ratio (σ). As the pH decreases,
2−
the equilibrium shifts toward H2 CO3 and HCO−
3 , reducing the concentration of CO3 ions. This
suppresses CaCO3 precipitation and can even dissolve existing solid CaCO3. Conversely, at
higher pH (lower [H⁺]), the equilibrium favours the formation of CO2−
3 ions, increasing
supersaturation and promoting CaCO3 precipitation.

3.1. CO2 dissolution constant
The CO2−
3 needed for the precipitation process is supplied by bubbling the CO2 into the solution.
Thus, the concentration of CO2−
3 in the solution not only depends on the pH of the solution but
also on the total carbonates on the solution (CT) which in turn depends on the amount of total
dissolved CO2. The concentration of dissolved CO2 in solution depends on the partial pressure
of CO2 (g) and dissolution capability of the gas governed by the temperature-dependent Henrys
constant (KH). According to Henry’s law, the dissolved CO2 concentration is:
CCO2 = K H pCO2

(9)

At ambient pressure and temperature conditions (25°C and 1 bar pressure), the partial pressure
of CO2 in the gas phase is about 400 ppm [35]. However, the partial pressure of CO2 can be
increased without increasing the system pressure by bubbling CO2 continuously into the
solution. Thus, when the partial pressure of CO2 increases to 100%, the maximum amount of
CO2 that can remain in dissolved form is 0.034 mol/L, from Equation (9). This is also the
limiting case for the concentration of carbonate ion in the solution at 1 bar pressure and very
high pH [32].

4. Experimental and methods
4.1. Materials
Two distinct sample solution types were used in this study to develop a control chain for the
selective precipitation of CaCO3 by capturing atmospheric CO2 into mine tailings extracts.
These include a real mine tailing extract prepared to study the extraction and filtration by the
partner university of KIT [36] and several model solutions prepared from different
concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2 to mimic the mine tailing extracts. These samples were
selected to cover a range of conditions and compositions relevant to both controlled and
practical applications.
The mine tailing extraction solution was prepared at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
(KIT). The solution was prepared to study the extraction efficiency of Ca2+ ions using different
acids for dissolving the tailing concentrations. HCl solution with the stoichiometric coefficient
of 1.0 was found to be most effective in extracting Ca2+ ions. More about the leaching process
can be found in the recent publication [36]. After extraction, the clear solution filtered from the
slurry was sent to us for the implementation of the selective precipitation. The concentration of
the ions present in the extraction solution were measured using Ion chromatography and found
to be 0.06307 mol/L and 0.0061 mol/L for Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively.
The model solution was explicitly prepared to facilitate the study of precipitation under
controlled conditions. This approach was chosen due to the easy accessibility of the required
chemicals and the ability to produce large quantities of solutions, which are essential for
comprehensive experimentation. The calcium-rich model solution was prepared by mixing
calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2.2H20) from Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG (Karlsruhe,
Germany) with MiliQ water from Merck Millipore (Massachusetts, US). The pH of the solution
is neutral, and to study the influence of impurities on the selective precipitation of CaCO3,
different concentrations of Mg2+ was used. Magnesium impurities were added in various
concentrations to the solution as magnesium chloride (MgCl2) from Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG
(Karlsruhe, Germany). The concentration of Ca2+ ions and impurities (Mg2+) in the model
solution were kept in the range of concentrations of these ions in that of the actual mine tailings

for the study. All the substances were well mixed with the magnetic stirrer to form a clear
solution without any dissolved particles. In contrast to the model solution, the extraction
solutions prepared by KIT required additional processing, including filtration, after the
extraction step to remove particulate matter and ensure the clarity of the solutions. This
additional step emphasized the practical challenges associated with handling real mine tailing
extracts, further highlighting the utility of the model solution for preliminary and large-scale
testing.
For the shifting of the pH of the solution (model and mine tailing extract) to alkaline ranges,
1M NaOH solution (at pH 13.29) was used. The NaOH solution was prepared by mixing solid
NaOH crystal from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany) with the MilliQ water. Similarly, for
the pH shift of the solution to acidic range, 25% HCl solution from Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG
(Karlsruhe, Germany) was used. The CO2 gas from Linde GmbH (Pullach, Germany) was used
as the source for the CO2 for the carbonate precipitation process.

4.2. Experimental setup and procedure
The carbonate precipitation experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor in an open system
setup. The reactor was operated in a semi-batch mode to provide precise control over the
reaction conditions necessary for the selective precipitation of CaCO3. The reactor, equipped
with a stirrer to ensure homogeneous mixing, was maintained at a constant room temperature.
The reactor was provided with a high-pressure resistant glass window for viewing the reaction
condition. This setup, Figure 1, allowed for the gradual and controlled addition of reactants,
which is critical for achieving uniform supersaturation and avoiding localized conditions that
could lead to the formation of undesired by-products.

Figure 1: Experimental setup for selective CaCO3 precipitation
The control profiles for the carbonation process is based on the pH of the solution. The setup
provided for the continuous measurement of the solution pH using a calibrated pH sensor, pH
electrode InLab® Expert Go-ISM, by Mettler Toledo (Ohio, US). For the pH-swing
implementation, NaOH solution was supplied through a diaphgram liquid dosing pump,
SIMDOS® 10 FEM 1.10 S by KNF Holding AG (Schenkon, Switzerland). The measurement
of the change in the concentration of Calcium ion during the experiment is a critical factor for
the control of the selective precipitation and the important stopping criteria for the process.
Hence the Ca2+ ion concentration must be continuously monitored. This was achieved by using
calcium ion selective electrode (ISE), DX240-Ca ISE half-cell electrode by Mettler Toledo.
Periodic sampling for ion chromatography (IC) analysis further validated these measurements.
To facilitate the introduction of CO2 gas for the carbonation process, at a controlled flow rate,
a gas inlet valve was integrated at the side of the reactor as shown in Figure 1. The CO2 gas was

bubbled into the calcium-rich solution for the carbonate reaction and the supply was regulated
using a mass flow controller (MFC), ensuring precise dosing. The CO2 concentration in the
solution was measured using the CO2 sensor, CO₂NTROL Dissolved CO2 Sensors by Hamilton
Bonaduz AG (Bonaduz, Switzerland). The gas was bubbled into the solution until the partial
pressure of CO2 and thus the concentration (Section 1.3) reached 100%.
For the implementation of the autonomous process control for the selective precipitation of
CaCO3 from the multi-ion solution, control strategies were developed to steer the process not
only towards pure CaCO3 but also maximise the precipitated CaCO3. The control of the
precipitation process was achieved through pH regulation of the solution. The solution pH was
regulated through the different dosing mechanisms of CO2 (g) and NaOH (l). Two unique
dosing mechanisms were investigated, separate dosing of CO2 and NaOH one after the other
and the other with simultaneous dosing of NaOH and CO2, discussed in Section 0. Based on
the dosing mechanisms, two distinct pH profiles have been implemented in a semi-batch
experimental setup, in Figure 1, for the selective precipitation of CaCO3 and to develop the
control mechanisms further needed for the autonomous process chain development.
The experimental procedure involved preparing a 900 mL solution containing known
concentrations of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions, prepared by mixing CaCl2 and MgCl2 in different
concentrations and initial concentrations measured using IC. The pH, CO2 concentration, and
Ca2+ ion concentration were monitored continuously using the sensors described above. The
pH was first adjusted to 7, then the CO2 was bubbled at 200 ml/min until saturation (100 %
volume %) was achieved and the pH of the solution stabilized as shown in Figure 2 (a) and
Figure 3 (a). Subsequently, 1M NaOH (l) was added at a rate of 9 mL/min to increase the pH
and induce precipitation, with pH and Ca²⁺ concentration being monitored continuously. The
NaOH addition continued with and without CO2 addition based on the control strategy being
investigated until the predefined target pH was achieved and the solution was allowed to reach
a steady state. CO2 and Ca²⁺ concentrations were continuously measured for the rate estimation,
and steady-state conditions were confirmed once CO2 concentration stabilized. Following this,
alternatively or simultaneously the CO2 and NaOH were added until next predefined saturation
points until all the Ca²⁺ ion concentration in the solution was depleted to approximately 10-5
mol/L, ensuring complete precipitation of CaCO3.

4.3. Characterization
The characterization of the precipitated carbonates is one of the most important steps for the
selectivity analysis of CaCO3 separation from a multi-ion mixture solution. The
characterization was performed using a combination of analytical techniques to assess its purity,
crystalline structure, thermal stability, and surface morphology. After each carbonate
precipitation experiment, the solid crystals were dried and characterised by means of X-ray
Diffraction (XRD), crystal size distribution, morphological and thermal analysis.
The phase purity of the precipitates was measured from the XRD spectra on a D2-Phaser
diffractometer by Bruker Corporation (Massachusetts, US). equipped with a Cu anode for Kα
radiation generation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at an operating voltage of 40 kV. XRD was also employed
to analyse the morphology of CaCO3 precipitated (i.e. Calcite, Aragonite, and Vaterite) and
measure its crystal sizes. Measurements were performed in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a step
size of 0.01° and scanning speed of 1s/step. The crystalline phases were identified using the
Powder Diffraction File PDF-4/Minerals 2020 database from JCPDS. Previous studies [37] and
[38], have also demonstrated the ability of XRD to evaluate phase transitions and the influence
of reaction conditions on CaCO3 polymorphs. Along with the XRD, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) imaging was used to investigate the phase morphology of the precipitated

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vqllg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-3445-6405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

CaCO3. For this purpose, tungsten cathode-based SEM/EDX device JEOL JSM 5410 (Tokyo,
Japan) was used for the imaging of the precipitated CaCO3. Different magnifications were used
from the range of 5000x – 10000x and at 5kV.
The particle size distribution of the precipitated CaCO3 was determined using a Malvern
Mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction analyser (), which employs a He-Ne laser (λ = 633 nm) and
a light scattering angle of 0.02–135°. Samples were dispersed in MilliQ water to ensure welldispersed and agglomerate-free suspensions before measurement.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to evaluate the thermal stability and
decomposition behaviour of the precipitated CaCO3 using a Thermal Analysis System
TGA/DSC 3+ by Mettler Toledo (Ohio, USA) under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere, with a
heating rate of 10°C/min from 25°C to 1000°C. The weight loss associated with CO₂ release
during decomposition was used to confirm the purity of CaCO3.
Along with the solid precipitate analysis, it is necessary to analyse the residual solution to close
the mass balance. The concentrations of the various residual ions (Mg²⁺, Na⁺, Ca2+, Cl⁻) were
analysed using an Ion chromatography (IC) in the post-precipitation solution. Measurements
were carried out using a Thermo Scientific Dionex ICS-6000 IC system, equipped with
conductivity detectors and appropriate separation columns for ion analysis. The eluents used
for cation and anion separation were methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and a carbonate/bicarbonate
buffer, respectively.

5. Results and Discussion
The results of the experimental procedure, using the both pH control strategies, demonstrated
the implementation of the selective precipitation of pure CaCO3 from different multi-ion
solutions prepared from model substances and extracted mine tailings. Analysis of the
precipitates and the remaining solution provided insights into the mechanisms governing the
precipitation and the role of key parameters such as pH, ion concentration, impurities and CO2
availability.
The model solutions prepared were in the concentration range of the real mine tailing exactions
taken from the study by Baechle at KIT [36]. Based on this, different concentrations of Ca2+
ions with combination with Mg2+ ions as impurities were used for the CaCO3 precipitation
investigation as mentioned in Table 2. By bubbling CO2 until saturation and then increasing by
NaOH, the CaCO3 started to precipitate at different pH conditions based on the concentration
of ions in it.

From Table 2, we can see that for higher the Ca2+ ion concentration, the supersaturation is
achieved earlier (i.e. at lower pH) and the CaCO3 precipitates soon. This is because, from

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vqllg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-3445-6405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

Equation 1.3 we saw that higher concentration, larger is the supersaturation factor, leading to
precipitation. From the experiments, it was observed that not only the Ca2+ and CO2−
3
concentrations have an influence on the supersaturation, but also in the presence of other
impurities (such as Mg2+) leads to higher supersaturation, thus quicker start of the precipitation
at lower pH conditions. The ion concentration analysis of the solution via IC, before and after
the precipitation, revealed that the Mg2+ concentration did not change significantly, but the Ca2+
concentration reduced by a small amount. Still not all Ca2+ present in the solution was
precipitated as CaCO3. This is due to the limited availability of the CO2−
3 ions in the solution,
dictated by the waters ability to hold dissolved CO2 in the solution as described in Section 1.
Hence to be able to precipitate all the Ca2+ ions in the solution as CaCO3 and capture as much
as CO2 possible, more CO2 was needed to be added to system. The goal here was that we
develop an autonomous controller to carry out the precipitation process and steer the process
towards maximum yield of pure CaCO3. Since pH was the control variable chosen to direct the
precipitation process, certain projectiles for the pH profiles as control strategies were
developed. The control strategies aimed to optimize CaCO3 precipitation by precisely
regulating pH fluctuations and monitoring Ca²⁺ concentration in real-time.

5.1. pH Control strategies
5.1.1. pH swing strategy
The pH swing strategy is a dynamic approach used for the selective precipitation of CaCO3
from the multi-ion mixture of Ca2+ and Mg2+. This method relies on alternating acidic and basic
conditions through sequential dosing of CO2 gas and NaOH solution. A solution with 0.1M
each of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was prepared for the implementation of the strategy and filled into the
reactor setup shown in Figure 1. Initially, CO2 (g) was bubbled into the solution until saturation
(100% volume) was achieved, leading to a decrease in pH and further stabilization as shown in
Figure 2 (a) and (b). Upon stabilization, 1 M NaOH solution was introduced at a controlled rate
to elevate the pH, inducing CaCO3 precipitation. The addition of NaOH continued until the pH
reached 9, at which point dosing was halted, and the system was allowed to reach a steady state,
in Figure 2 (a). In the Figure 2 (b) this can be seen by the increase in the Na+ concentration
while the CO2 concentration decreased. The progression of Ca2+ ion concentration was
continuously monitored, with steady-state conditions confirmed by a minimum and stable CO2
concentration following CaCO3 formation via carbonate (CO2−
3 ) conversion. After reaching
steady-state conditions, CO2 gas was reintroduced to re-establish acidic conditions, reducing
the pH to approximately 5.8, during which while the CO2 concentration increased, the Na+
concentration remained constant. Once saturation was achieved, NaOH was dosed again to
increase the pH back to 9, repeating the cycle. This pH swing process was iterated until Ca2+
concentration was reduced to approximately 10-5 mol/L on the ISE, ensuring near-complete
CaCO3 precipitation.
Samples from both the solution and precipitates were collected at the end of steady states for
further analysis. Ion concentrations were assessed using ion chromatography (IC), while the
solid phase and particle size distribution (PSD) of the precipitates were characterized using the
XRD and the Mastersizer, respectively.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the pH swing control strategy in achieving selective
CaCO3 precipitation while minimizing co-precipitation of MgCO3 or Mg(OH)2. This can be
seen for the example of initial 0.1M each of Ca2+ and Mg2+. In Figure 2 (a) we see by the
decrease in the Ca2+ concentration while Mg2+ concentration remains almost constant
throughout the precipitation process. The formation and precipitation of CaCO3 can be seen

from Figure 2 (a) where we see that the Ca2+ concentration decreases quickly while NaOH
addition due to high supersaturation and slightly increases during the CO2 addition due to the
dissolution of some of the precipitated CaCO3 caused by slight undersaturation. While in Figure
2 (b), the CO2 addition up to saturation (100% Volume %) resulting in pH decrease and for the
2−
NaOH addition, the CO2 concentration falls to minimum due to conversion to HCO−
3 and CO3
by acid dissociation. Also, the NaOH concentration remains constant while CO2 addition and
increases only when additional NaOH is supplied, thus showing all the Na+ ions stay in the
dissolved phase and do not precipitate. The analysis of the precipitates has been discussed in
the next sections.

Figure 2: pH swing profile for selective precipitation of CaCO3
The strategy is easy to implement and control and pure CaCO3 can be precipitated. Also, the
number of swings required for the near complete depletion of the Ca2+ ions from the solution
can be predetermined based on the initial Ca2+ concentration and the operating pressure of the
system as can be seen in Table 3. This is because of the limited amount of CO2 the solution can
hold at a particular pressure (Section 1). Table 3 also shows the decrease in the Ca2+
concentration at the end of each swing cycle.

Figure 3: pH constant profile for selective precipitation of CaCO3
Unlike the pH swing strategy, the pH constant strategy involves the simultaneous addition of
CO2 (g) and NaOH (l) to maintain a stable pH within the optimal range for the CaCO3
precipitation Figure 3 (a) for 0.1M Ca2+ and 0.1M Mg2+ ion-rich solution. By keeping the pH
constant, this approach mitigates the continuous fluctuations and provides a more controlled

environment for continuous CaCO3 precipitation. As shown in Figure 3, after the first phase of
CO2 addition until saturation, the pH of the solution was raised to 7.5 by adding NaOH (l), by
turning off the CO2 (g) addition. If CO2 (g) supply was not turned off, the pH of the solution
rises very slowly initially leading to low precipitation and then the pH rises very quickly making
the process uncontrollable. Hence, even for the pH constant strategy, NaOH (l) was dosed
predominantly until pH 7.5. Samples are collected at this point for the analysis and precipitate
characterisation. Then CO2 (g) was bubbled continuously to the solution while maintain the pH
of the solution at 7.5 by occasional dosing NaOH (l) and the precipitation was continued until
the Ca2+ concentration fell below 10-5 mol/L on the ISE. Here since there was no back and
forth shifting of the pH, the Ca2+ ion constantly dropped due to the precipitation of CaCO3.
Also, the IC measurements revealed that Mg2+ concentration remained constant indication no
co-precipitation of magnesium compounds (see Figure 3 (a)). The analysis of the precipitated
product also revealed that selective precipitation of pure CaCO3. The details of the phase purity
and PSD have been discussed in Section 5.2. In Figure 3 (b), while the NaOH concentration
constantly increased, the CO2 concentration remanded nearly stayed constant at pH 7.5, due to
the immediate transition to the bicarbonate and carbonate ions.

5.2. pH Control strategy comparison
After the successful implementation of the both the control strategies, it was found that the
strategies are suitable for precipitating CaCO3 selectively. Both the strategies are equally
capable of precipitating maximum amount of CaCO3 from the solution while minimising the
Mg2+ co-precipitation (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). While the pH constant method takes shorter
time than the pH swing method for precipitation of CaCO3, it requires larger amount of NaOH
solution (about 200 ml for 0.1M Ca2+ initial conc.) for the precipitation leading to larger dilution
of the ions present. Also, the pH constant method requires for the continuous monitoring of the
Ca2+ ion conc. with an ISE, thus limiting the process applicability to low pressure and
temperature operating conditions. While in the pH swing method depending on the initial
concentration of Ca2+, it can be accurately estimated the number of swings required as seen in
Table 3 without the need for the constant Ca2+ ion monitoring. Along with these differences,
the two methods also dictate the particle phase, morphology, the PSD of the precipitated CaCO3
and most importantly also influences the precipitation phenomenon i.e. primary nucleation or
growth of existing crystals, thus enhancing the selectivity of the precipitates formed.

To investigate the phase purity of the two precipitates formed from both the strategies, the
implementation of the thermal stability analysis via TGA is shown in Figure 4, in comparison
to that of the commercially available 99% pure CaCO3 (from Carl Roth GmbH). The
decomposition of the precipitates resulted in the approximately 44% reduction in weight which
is similar to the weight loss of the ideal CaCO3 (molar mass: 100 g/L) due to the decomposition
on the release of CO2 gas (molar mass: 44 g/L). As can be seen in the Figure, though the
decomposition weight is in comparison to that of the commercial CaCO3, the decomposition
takes longer for both the precipitates formed in Mg2+ rich environment. This could be due to
the precipitates forming large clusters making the escape of CO2 or small amount of other
substances (such as NaCl) over the surface of the precipitates. This needs further investigation
and would be continued in the upcoming work.
With this analysis we identified the phase purity of the precipitates produced from both
strategies, thus establishing their effectiveness. But the method offers no information about the
morphology and PSD of precipitates. This has been discussed in the next sections.
5.2.1. Impact of pH control strategies on CaCO3 morphology
The implementation of two distinct control strategies revealed that not only do impurities in the
solution influence the phase composition of CaCO3, but the reaction kinetics and pH control
also play a critical role in determining particle yield. Calcium carbonate can form three different
polymorphs, Calcite, Vaterite, and Aragonite, each with distinct characteristics. By applying
the appropriate control strategy, the precipitation process can be steered toward the formation
of specific morphologies tailored to application requirements.
Figure 5 presents the XRD measurements of precipitate samples collected at the points marked
in Figure 2 and Figure 3. For the pH swing strategy, the initial precipitation at pH 9 primarily
yields Calcite and Vaterite (Figure 5(a)). A similar trend is observed in the pH constant strategy,
where the first NaOH addition (point 1 in Figure 3a) also results in the formation of Calcite and
Vaterite (Figure 5(b)). However, as precipitation progresses, the two strategies diverge in their
effects on phase composition. In the pH swing method, Calcite continues to dominate with
subsequent swings, whereas in the pH constant method, Aragonite begins to emerge while
Vaterite diminishes. By the end of the process, the pH swing strategy predominantly produces
small Calcite particles via primary nucleation, whereas the pH constant strategy facilitates the
growth of larger Aragonite particles due to secondary nucleation and growth over existing
nuclei.
The morphology of these precipitated carbonates is further illustrated through SEM images in
Figure 6. In Figure 6(a), Aragonite precipitated from the pH constant process exhibits a
characteristic rod-like, fibrous structure, forming rosette-like aggregates [24]. In contrast,
Figure 6 (b), and (c) display the Calcite and Vaterite morphologies formed via the pH swing
strategy. The Calcite crystals appear as compact, densely packed rhombohedral structures,
whereas Vaterite presents loosely aggregated, needle-like clusters forming star-shaped
structures. These findings confirm that by carefully selecting the control strategy, both the rate
of precipitation and the final morphology of CaCO3 can be regulated, allowing for applicationspecific material synthesis.

5.2.2. Impact of pH control strategies on the PSD
The major impact of the control strategies is on the particle size distribution of the precipitated
CaCO3. We see in Figure 7 the time-dependent PSD histograms for 0.1M Ca2+ initial ion
concentration based on the two control strategies at the different measurement points mentioned
in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In Figure 7 (a) the PSD for the pH swing strategy is shown where
initially (at the measurement point 1) small particles, mean size around 1.39 µm are precipitated
at pH 9 due to the addition of NaOH. Smaller particles are precipitated due to high
supersaturation (Equation (4)) leading to the birth of new nucleus. On further addition of CO2,
the pH decreases resulting in undersaturation leading to the dissolution of the smallest particles.
This results in the shift of the PSD causing the mean size of the particles to increase to
approximately 2.4 µm, though the number of particles has reduced. On continuing the cycle of
NaOH and CO2 addition we see that very large number of small nuclei with mean size 0.9 µm
are precipitated owing to the high supersaturation. Though CO2 is added and smaller crystals
dissolve, the mean size is not affected majorly due to smaller undersaturation due to the pH
reduction. Also, a smaller bimodal distribution is observed that could be due to growth or
aggregation of the nuclei.
On the contrary, for the pH constant strategy (in Figure 7 (b)), since the pH is held constant
after the first increase, the primary nuclei formed of the similar mean size (1.42 µm), grow

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vqllg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-3445-6405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

(Equation (5)) over the precipitation period due to small supersaturation caused by to the
continuous CO2 addition and pH being held stable at 7.5. The process results in change of the
precipitation phenomenon from primary uncontrolled nucleation to better controllable growth
of the nucleated crystals. Thus, we observe a well- defined bi-modal distribution with the final
mean size of over 6.6 µm.

Figure 7: PSD for precipitated CaCO3 through (a) pH swing, (b) pH constant strategy
In Figure 8, we see the final particle size of the precipitated CaCO3 for different initial
concentrations of Ca2+ ions at the end of the precipitation process. The Figure 8 (a) depicts the
final sizes for the pH swing strategy, where we see large nucleation of very small particles due
to high supersaturation. For the extraction solution also, the precipitation by the nucleation
mechanism dominates. In Figure 8 (a), we also see that for higher initial concentrations of Ca2+
ions, the mean size shifts lower due to very large number of smaller nuclei formed
spontaneously, thus indication that the supersaturation control plays a crucial role in the PSD.
In Figure 8 (b) on the contrary we see that the for the pH constant strategy, the final PSD at the
end of the process has shifted to larger sizes indicating a growth over the existing nuclei. The
extraction solution also follows the trend indicating that this control strategy offers a better
regulation of the PSD and thus the overall precipitation process.

6. Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the influence of pH regulation on the selective precipitation of
CaCO3 from a multi-ion solution. Two pH-based control strategies were developed to direct the
process toward the selective formation of pure CaCO3 using waste-derived solutions.
A semi-batch reactor setup with pH control was implemented to develop these strategies. Initial
investigations were carried out with model solutions prepared using laboratory-grade CaCl2 as
the Ca2+ source at varying concentrations. The ability of the control strategies for the selective
precipitation in the presence of impurities was examined by adding MgCl2 as source of Mg2+
ions to the Ca2+-rich solutions. The effectiveness of the control strategies was further
demonstrated using actual mine tailing extraction solutions. The carbonate ions (CO2−
3 ) was
supplied through bubbling pure CO2 gas into the solution in an open system setup at
atmospheric pressure. For the pH regulation of the process, 1M NaOH was dosed. Ion
concentrations were monitored over time to track the process and determine its endpoint.
Two distinct control strategies were developed: pH swing and pH constant. Based on the
strategy, the morphology and particle sizes of the precipitates can be controlled. In the pH swing

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vqllg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-3445-6405 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

strategy, the pH of the solution was lowered to 6 and increased to 9 cyclically by dosing CO2
gas and NaOH solution respectively, until the Ca2+ ions in the solutions nearly depleted. Using
this approach, the initially precipitated Calcite and Vaterite when subjected to cyclic
precipitation and dissolution changed to completely clustered rhombohedral Calcite crystals.
Rapid shift in the pH by NaOH addition to CO2 saturated solution resulted in high
supersaturation thereby causing spontaneous formation of very small particle sizes via
nucleation. It was observed that for this control strategy, the number of swings (cycles) required
could be predetermined based on the initial concentration of Ca2+ ions, without the need for
continuous ion concentration monitoring, to avoid co-precipitation of other substances, thus
providing simpler operational capabilities.
In contrast, the pH constant strategy, maintained a steady pH of 7.5 by continuous CO2 dosing
and intermittent NaOH addition. This method completed the process more quickly and
maintained low supersaturation throughout. Due to this, the precipitation process which started
initially with primary nucleation was followed by growth of the nuclei, making the process
more suitable for the modelling and control purposes. Also, the Aragonite crystals dominated
the morphology of the precipitated CaCO3. This behaviour was consistent across different Ca2+
ion concentrations and with real extraction solutions, thus demonstrating the robustness and
applicability of the strategy.
The model for the semi-batch process has been developed and would be presented in the future.
Also, the influence of other impurities and concentrations would be investigated for
development of a robust autonomous controller for the carbonation process chain.
