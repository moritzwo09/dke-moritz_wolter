Abstract
Phenolic compounds and their derivatives represent a significant concern within the realm of water pollution, due
to their pronounced toxicity, environmental persistence, and extensive utilization across industrial sectors. These
pollutants emanate from a multitude of sources, including petrochemical industries, pharmaceutical production,
and the manufacture of pesticides, thereby posing considerable threats to both aquatic ecosystems and human
health. Conventional water treatment methodologies, encompassing biological degradation, adsorption, and
chemical oxidation, frequently fall short in achieving complete elimination of these contaminants or may
inadvertently generate secondary pollutants, thereby underscoring the need for the formulation of alternative
treatments that are more effective and sustainable. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been recognized as an
innovative material for the remediation of phenol and its derivatives, because of their high surface area,
remarkable catalytic efficacy, and pronounced adsorption properties. The distinctive characteristics of AgNPs
facilitate the efficient degradation and transformation of phenolic compounds through mechanisms such as
adsorption, photocatalysis, and catalytic degradation redox reactions. Furthermore, the functionalization of
AgNPs with stabilizing agents enhances their stability, selectivity, and reusability, thereby rendering them as a
viable option for water purification. This article critically reviews recent progress in AgNP-based purification of
waterbodies by removing phenols. Notable findings indicate that AgNPs substantially augment the rates of phenol
degradation, with variables such as nanoparticle size, surface modifications, and prevailing environmental
conditions playing pivotal roles in their operational efficiency. Nevertheless, challenges pertaining to nanoparticle
aggregation, potential environmental toxicity, and the feasibility of large-scale application require further
exploration. Future research should prioritize eco-friendly synthesis or green synthesis methodologies, enhanced
recovery techniques, and the mitigation of potential risks linked to nanoparticle discharge.

Introduction
Water pollution in the environment has become a significant concern due to the toxic nature of phenolic
derivatives which can adversely affect aquatic life and human health. Phenolic compounds are the organic
compounds that are characterized by the hydroxyl group attached to them [1]. These compounds are widely
recognized for their presence in industrial effluents and their potential to cause significant environmental harm
due to their toxicity and persistence in water [2]. Phenolic derivatives are significant contributors to water
pollution, as they are widely used in dye industries which discharge their organic dyes such as Azo dye (which
contains nitrophenols). These dyes are highly stable, carcinogenic and non-biodegradable [5]. Furthermore,
phenolic compounds can accumulate in food chain, contaminated water sources and food products; posing risk
to human health [3]. Adsorption which is usually followed by oxidative degeneration has emerged as an effective
technique to accelerate the treatment of dye effluent pollution. [6]. Dyes such as Rh B is also treated with this
technique [4]. Phenols and the nitro derivatives of phenols were categorized as toxic pollutants by the US – EPA
[7]. The nitrophenols besides odour problem causes colour change in many water bodies, which becomes the

source of environmental damage of living organisms by decreasing sunlight, which disturbs the aquatic
environment [8,9].
Phenolic contamination is majorly sourced by industrial effluents (by activities like petroleum refining, plastic
manufacturing and effluents released from dye industries in the form of Azo-dyes which contain nitrophenols)
[9]. Phenol is used in chemical industries to produce derivatives such as alkylphenols, resins, aniline and cresols
[11]. It also finds a noteworthy application in energy sector [10], pharmaceutical sector [35], textile, pesticides
[54], and explosive industries from where the effluents or/and influents are discharged into the water bodies
contributing in polluting them. As the phenolic compounds are highly reactive, they have the tendency of
interacting and reacting with other components present in the aquatic environment such as the interaction of
phenols with microbes [12,13] and with inorganic compounds [14,15]. Once in the environment, the phenolic
compounds undergo metabolic transformation readily oxidising to quinone radicals that is known to have toxic
effects on humans by forming covalent bonds with protein which can lead to DNA damage [16]. Other phenolic
compounds such as chlorophenols, nitrophenols, aminophenol, bisphenol A are identified to have adverse effects
on human [17]. The effects may include disrupting the development of mammary glands and delaying the onset
of puberty in females [18,19], damage the vital organs like heart, kidney, liver, lungs and stomach [20-24].
Conventional methods like adsorption, chemical oxidation, microbial degradation, membrane separation
[40,41,42] are used to reduce phenols from waste water, however due to the high polarity and chemical persistence
of phenolic compounds these methods have relatively low efficiency (as low as 20-40%) in reducing phenolic
derivatives from water system [43].
Nanoparticles, especially purely made inorganic nanoparticles such as gold (Au), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu),
have distinctive optical and photochemical properties which makes them ideal for reducing phenolic compounds
in water [36]. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) due to its properties such as high surface area and reactivity [81],
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [82], surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) [83,84] are used to remove
phenol from water system by adsorption [82-90], catalytic degradation [91-101] and photocatalytic degradation
[102-110] mechanism. The silver nanoparticles works as photocatalyst in degradation (oxidation) of phenolic
derivation [37,38,39], when AgNPs is combined with metallic oxides such as TiO2 [106] and ZnO [107] enhances
the photocatalytic degradation of phenol. The removal efficiency of phenol depends on size [92] and morphology
[115-118] of AgNPs. Environmental factors such as pH [119,120], temperature [121-123] organic and inorganic
contaminants [124-128] which blocks the active sites on the surface of AgNPs, reducing the removal efficiency
of phenol. AgNPs released in the environment to remove phenol has toxic effects to mammals [129,130], nonmammals [131] and plants [132]. In this review the importance of green synthesis is highlighted as the green
synthesis uses non-toxic and biodegradable reagents that can work as both reducing and capping agents which
enhances the cost-effectiveness and reduce the toxicity of silver nanoparticles in the environment. More emphasis
should be made to do relevant research on microbial mediated synthesis especially viral mediated synthesis of
AgNPs [147]. The scope of this review is to discuss the effects and sources of phenol contamination. This review
also discusses the use of silver nanoparticles to remove phenol and its derivatives from waste water, also
highlighting the toxic effects of silver nanoparticles and the importance of using green synthesis which consist of
plant and microbial mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

1.Phenolic Derivatives: Sources, Properties and Environmental Impact.
1.1 Sources of Phenolic Derivative in water.
The source of phenolic contamination in water can be categorized as Anthropogenic sources and Natural sources.
1.1.1Anthropogenic Sources
Due to their wide range of application, phenolic compounds are used in different industries such as chemical
industries, coal and gas industries, dye, textile, explosive industries and pharmaceutical industries. It is used in
chemical industries to produce other derivatives such as resins, aniline, cresols and alkylphenols [11]. Phenol

serves as a vital part of many products like paints, medicine and lubricants. It is specially used as an intermediate
product in the synthesis of phenolic compounds such as formaldehyde resins. It is also used to produce epoxide
resins and polycarbonate which serves as a precursor for making plastic [47]. The pharmaceutical application of
phenolic derivatives is remarkable as it used as a flexible precursor in drugs like aspirin and pharyngitis, cosmetics
like sunscreen, skin lighting products and hair dye [48]. Phenolic derivatives find its application in wood
distillation, water disinfection and for making paper, all this results in the formation of chlorophenols [46]. The
phenolic contaminated effluents are discharged by the industries directly or indirectly which results in water
pollution due to phenolic contamination. It is observed that the concentration of phenolic discharge from
refineries is 6-500 mg L-1, cooking processes is 28-3900 mg L-1, coal and gas processing is 9-6800 mg L-1,
pharmaceutical product is 0.1-1600 mg L-1 and petrochemical plants is 2.8-1220 mg L-1 [49-51]. In a study,
second largest river of Ukraine, Dniester was studied, which reported that due to oil field nearby the river,
phenolic concentration on the surface water of Dniester River was observed to be 0.009 and 0.081 mg L-1, whereas
the reservoir contained an average of 0.026 mg L -1 of phenolic derivatives [52]. Phenols are the major constituents
of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides which are the main agricultural sources of water pollution by phenolic
compounds. Most pentachlorophenol [55] and chlorophenols such as 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2-chlorophenol are
used in pesticides [53]. Other phenolic derivatives such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid are used as pesticides
[54]. Pentachlorophenol degrades to other chlorophenols with lower chlorine substituents [55]. These pesticides,
insecticides, herbicides and their degradation by products are often washed into the water system.
1.1.2 Natural Sources
Plants, microorganism and decomposition of organic matter are recognized to be the natural sources responsible
for contamination of phenolic derivatives in water bodies. Dead plants and animals in water bodies usually
release phenolic compounds in water as the phenolic derivatives are components of many aquatic or terrestrial
plant species. Few phenolic compounds are formed from amino acids present in hemicellulose of plants under
the influence of ultraviolet light irradiation [56]. Phenylalanine which is a precursor for synthesis of phenols in
plants is deaminated through phenylalanine ammonia-lysase catalysis and is converted to cinnamate. The
obtained cinnamate is then converted to coumaric acid through hydroxylation catalyzed by cinnamate-4hydroxylase. Coumaric acid is the starting material for producing flavonoids, stilbenes and furanocoumarins [63].
As these compounds are stored in roots and leaves, decomposition of dead roots and leaves introduces phenolic
derivatives to soil and eventually into water bodies. The metabolic waste of human and other mammals also
contains phenol [58] which is produced in the gut of human and other mammals as a result of tyrosine
transformation [59]. It is well known fact that microorganism have the potential to degrade naturally occurring
substrates into phenolic compounds [60]. Red and green marine algae contain macromolecules of phenolic
derivatives [57]. In a study, Max et al. [61], reported that Debaryomyces hansenii metabolizes ferulic acid to
produce 4-vinyl guaiacol, vanillic acid, vanillin and 4-ethylguaiacol. Another study by Shashwati et al. [62]
reported Streptomyces sannanensis ability to convert ferulic acid to vanillic acid. All this contributes to
contamination of phenol and its derivativities in water system.

1.2 Classification and Effects of Phenolic derivatives on Human.
1.2.1 Classification of Phenolic Derivatives
Based on the number of phenolic groups present in a molecule, phenolic compounds can be grouped as simple,
bi and polyphenols. Phenolic derivatives such as hydroquinone, resorcinol, thymol, etc. have only one substituted
phenolic ring and hence are simple phenols. These phenolic compounds are highly soluble in water due to the
presence of single hydroxyl group, it often finds its application in disinfectants and chemical industries [64,66].
Biphenols are identified by the presence of two phenolic rings. These phenols have low solubility. Bisphenol A
(BPA) is a common example of bi phenols, which is found in industrial waste and is known to have adverse
effects on human health [66]. Compounds that consist of multiple units of phenolic structure are known as

polyphenols; these are naturally found in plant (roots and leaves) [63]. Flavonoids, tannins, lignin and stilbenes
are few examples of polyphenols [65]. The solubility of polyphenol is variable. Lower molecular weight
polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids) are moderately soluble in water, on the other hand high molecular weight
polyphenols (e.g., tannins) are poorly soluble in water and form colloidal suspension in water, however these are
soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol [67].
1.2.2. Toxicity to Humans
Phenols are considered as one of the most toxic organic contaminants in waste water as they are highly toxic,
even at low concentrations [69]. The European Union Directive 2455/2001/EC has set a limit of 0.5µgL -1 of
phenolic concentration in drinking water with its individual concentration not exceeding 0.1µgL-1 [68]. Due to
their non-biodegradable nature, they remain in the aquatic system for a long time [70]. According American
Conference of Government Industrial Hygienist (ACGIH) the exposure limit of phenol on skin should be less
than 5 mgL-1 [72]. Exposing to high concentration of phenol to skin can cause blisters and burns [20]. Once in
the system they metabolize and transform into reactive intermediate form such as quinone, which is known to
form covalent bonds with protein, thus exhibiting toxic effects to humans [16]. For instance, catechols have the
tendency to damage DNA by destroying some proteins in the body [16]. Phenols and its derivatives were
identified as stable priority chemical pollutants by US Environmental Protecting Agency (EPA) [7], which are
summarized in Table 1. Phenolic derivatives such as chlorocatechol, nitrophenol, chlorophenols and
aminophenol are also categorized to exert toxic effects on humans [17]. Burning sensation in throat and mouth
can be caused by chlorophenols [22]. Chlorophenols poisoning may also damage liver, kidney, lungs, digestive
system and skin [23]. Bisphenol A which is a biphenol known to disrupt the development of mammary glands
[18] and delay the onset of puberty in female [19]. Liquids that contain high phenolic concentration (1g) if
ingested can cause fatality to humans as it may damage heart, kidney, liver and other internal vital organs [20].
In a study, Alshabib et al. [71] reported that acute phenol exposure may cause complication of central nervous
system and exposure to fumes containing phenol can damage internal organs such as lungs, kidney, liver heart,
and spleen. Due to these effects, strict limits on effluent discharge are amended. Therefore, an effluent discharge
is limited to 0.05 mgL-1 in the water system [72]; for non-chlorinated water it is 0.1 mgL-1 and chlorinated water
is 0.001-0.002 mgL-1 [72,73].

1.3 Environmental Impact
Phenols cause damage to aquatic life when the concentration in the water system exceeds 1mgL -1 [71]. Due to
the growing worldwide demand for textile products, these industries consume a high volume of water [76].
Phenols and their derivatives are used extensively in dyes such as Azo dyes that holds around 70% of market
share [77]. Many of these dyes are known to have toxic effects on human health and environment, concerns
regarding their toxicity and carcinogenicity have led to studies on toxicity of these dyes [74]. Due to dyes such
as Dispersive blue 3 [77] which have low biodegradability, have toxicity and complex chemical structure,
reduction of these effluents from environment is of great environmental concern [78]. Industrial activities have
adversely affected the ecology of water system. Most of the water bodies near industrial zone has been
contaminated by the effluents released by textile industries [79]. In a study Castro et al. [75], evaluated the toxicity
of pre and post-treatment of textile effluents, on four different organisms, namely A.fischer, Raphidocelis
subcapitata, Daphnia magna and Lemnar minor were used. Each of these organisms represented trophic levels.
This study reviled that pre-treatment effluents have more toxic effects on organism as compared to when it was
treated. However, treated effluents still exhibited toxicity towards D.magna. Due to high reactivity and nonbiodegradability, phenolic compounds in water system have the tendency to react with other components of
aquatic environment. Certain bacteria are known to degrade non-ionic surfactants into more toxic and harmful
phenolic derivatives such as alkyl phenolic compounds. For example, bacteria can degrade nonylphenol
polyethoxylated which may result in nonylphenol [12]. Tetrachlorocatechol which is formed by bacteria mediated
degradation of pentachlorophenol and chlorocatechol is identified to be the result of microbial degradation [13].
Radiation in the form of UV radiation from sun may result in the reaction between phenol and nitrite ion which
forms 2-nitophenol and 4-nitrophenol in water system [14], 2-nitrophenol can also be produced by the interaction
between hydroxyl radical and phenol in water system [80]. The reduced products are more toxic and poses greater
threat to the environment.

2. Properties of AgNPs used for the removal of Phenol from Water System.
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) possess unique physicochemical properties that enhances its effectiveness in
wastewater treatment, which also includes removal of phenol and its derivatives from untreated anthropogenic
effluents [11]. Some of the key properties contributing to their effectiveness includes:
1.High Surface Area and reactivity.
Silver nanoparticles, because of their small size exhibits high surface area and high surface-to-volume ratio,
which enhances their reactivity with organic pollutants such as phenol and its derivatives. Increased surface area
provides more active sites for adsorption and catalytic degradation. For instance, AgNPs are used to reduce 4nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol [81]. This makes silver nanoparticles an efficient material for removal of
contaminants such as phenol and its derivatives from waste water.
Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.

2. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
Differing from their bulk metal counterpart silver nanoparticles show unique properties such as strong surface
plasmon resonance (SPR), which arises from the collective oscillation of conduction electrons in response to
incident light. This property enhances the ability of AgNPs to interact with organic molecules facilitating
photolytic and adsorption-based removal of phenolic compounds [82]. SPR also contributes to improve electron
transfer, which is essential for oxidative degradation mechanisms.
3.Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)
AgNPs exhibits surface-enhanced Raman scattering which remarkably amplifies the Raman signals of adsorbed
molecules. This property of silver nanoparticles facilitates the detection and monitoring of phenol and its
derivatives in water system [83]. Additionally, the interaction between AgNPs and phenolic contamination
through SERS can improve degradation efficiency [84].
Due to these properties AgNPs are widely studied for their role in adsorption, catalytic oxidation and
photodegradation of toxic organic pollutants such as phenol and its derivatives.

3. Removal of phenol from water bodies by using silver nanoparticles
Water pollution is caused by phenol and its derivatives, due to their high toxicity and persistence have become a
significant environment concern [5]. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) due to their excellent adsorptive, catalytic and
photocatalytic properties have gained attention [44,45].
3.1. Adsorption Mechanism of phenol removal using silver nanoparticles
The adsorption of phenol in waste water by silver nanoparticles is facilitated via surface interaction [82]. The
AgNPs provide a high surface area to volume ratio, which allows phenol molecules in waste water to be adsorbed
on the surface of AgNPs [82]. The attraction of phenol molecules in aqueous environment also depends on the
surface charge of AgNPs which is often modified by stabilizers or surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), triton X-100 (non-ionic), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) [85]. This is often governed by:




Vander Waals Force: These are weak intermolecular forces between phenol molecules and AgNPs
which helps in the adsorption of phenol molecules onto AgNPs [86].
π-π Interaction: Phenol and its derivatives consist of aromatic rings which can interact with the metallic
surface of AgNPs via π-electron closed interaction [87].
Hydrogen bonding: Phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) group may form hydrogen bonds with hydroxylated
AgNPs and form weak coordinated complexes [87]. The oxygen atom in hydroxyl group (-OH) acts as a
donor, binding to silver ions, which provides stability and retention of phenol on nanoparticles surface
[87].

Surface-modifiers such as graphene, silica or activated carbon provides more functional groups for
interaction thus enhancing phenol adsorption [88]. AgNPs supported on zeolites or biochar increases the
surface area and improve adsorption efficiency [89,90].

Silver nanoparticles are widely used as catalyst for the degradation of organic contaminants like phenol and
its derivatives, this is due to their small size which translated in high surface area, strong redox properties
and their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) [81]. AgNPs acts as electron mediator and donor
which facilitates oxidation and reduction reactions, resulting in breaking down of phenols into smaller less
harmful compounds [93]. AgNPs enables the transfer of electrons between oxidants such as hydrogen
peroxide or dissolved oxygen and phenol molecules [94]. This promotes the generation of ROS such as
hydroxyl radicals (-OH) and superoxide radicals (O2-) which breaks the aromatic ring of phenol by attacking
it predominantly at ortho and para position due to their high electron density [99,100]. AgNPs can facilitate
reduction of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or Ferric ion by acting as an electron donor [95]. In
Fenton-like reaction Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ which is essential for the generation of hydroxyl radicals which
accelerates phenol degradation [96]. Fenton reaction, results in catechol ring opening which converts catechol
into muconioc acid that is further oxidized to maleic and fumaric acid [91]. As the Fe and H 2O2 concentration
is high, all the intermediates convert to formic acid which then oxidizes to non-toxic CO2 and H2O in water
bodies [92]. Fig 1. Illustrates the mechanism of phenolic degradation by Fenton-like reaction by using
AgNPs.
AgNPs mimics enzyme like activity of peroxidase enzyme, promoting ROS production without requiring
biological enzymes [97]. AgNPs due to their high surface area catalysis the conversion of H2O2 into -OH and
O2 allowing efficient adsorption, accelerating phenol degradation. Due to their stability under reaction
conditions AgNPs can be better alternative to biological peroxidase to remove phenol and its derivatives from
the water system [98].

Fig1. Mechanism of degradation of Phenol and its derivatives by Fenton-like reaction by using silver
nanoparticles.

3.3. Photocatalytic Degradation of phenol and its derivatives with the use of silver nanoparticles
Photocatalytic degradation of phenolic compound takes place with the use of silver nanoparticles in
combination with metal oxides catalyst like TiO2 and ZnO [111]. This has emerged as an effective method to
degrade phenol from water bodies [101]. Semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO absorbs photons through
UV or visible light, exciting electrons (e-) from valence bond to conduction band, this electron hole pairs (h+)

initiates photocatalytic degradation. AgNPs acts as an electron trap and helps in preventing recombination,
ensuring more reactive species are generated. These conduction band electrons react with dissolved oxygen
(O2) reducing it to superoxide anions (O2•), while valence band holes react with water (H2O) or hydroxide
ions (OH-) to produce hydroxyl radical (OH•). These reactive radicals attack and convert organic pollutants
such as phenol into carbon dioxide and water [102,103].
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) due to its high stability, non-toxicity and strong oxidation potential is widely used
as photocatalyst [105]. However, because of its wide bandgap ( ̴3.2 eV for anatase phase), that mainly
restricts its photocatalytic activity to UV light (ʎ < 387nm) [106]. AgNPs can be used to significantly improve
TiO2 – based photocatalysis [106]. Like TiO2, ZnO has a wide bandgap ( ̴ 3.37 eV) but it suffers from high
electron-hole recombination. AgNPs enhances charge separation and visible light adsorption when combined
with ZnO [107]. Owing to SPR effect, AgNPs can absorb visible light (400-700nm) and transfer energy to
semiconductor material, improving electron excitation and extending the photolytic activity beyond UV
range. This enhances phenol degradation under sunlight [82].
In a study, Stanley et al. [108] employed Ag-ZnO nanoparticles in powder form to degrade textile dye such
as Methylene lue, methyl orange and rhodamine B dyes. It reported the removal efficiency of 98.5%. In
another experiment, Thi et al. [109] reported 85% removal efficiency when Ag-ZnO nanostructures in
powdered form were used to remove Methylene blue from water. Wang L et al. [110] conducted a study in
which AgNPs were used to reduce Methyl Orange and Coomassie brilliant blue from waste water by
photocatalytic degradation. It reported the removal efficiency of 60-70%. By this we can state that the
combination of AgNPs with photocatalytic metal oxides enhances the removal of phenol.
The degree of effectiveness of photocatalytic degradation relies heavily on catalyst dose, exposure time,
solution pH and light intensity [101].

4. Factors affecting the efficiency of phenolic removal using silver nanoparticles
The removal of phenol and its derivatives usually depends on the size, morphology of nanoparticles and
environmental factors such as pH, temperature, ionic strength and presence of competing pollutants. The size
of silver nanoparticles plays a crucial role in removal of phenol and its derivatives. Smaller nanoparticles
have high surface area to volume ratio which translates in high surface energy, resulting in increased number
of active sites available for adsorption and catalytic degradation [85,92]. This enhanced surface, improves
the interaction between AgNPs and phenolic molecules, which leads to higher removal efficiency [111].
However, agglomeration may occur in extremely small nanoparticles, reducing their effectiveness [112].
Therefore, it is necessary to use surfactants or capping agents like Tween 20 and Polyvinyl pyrrolidone to
maintain optimal size for maximum efficiency [113,114].
AgNPs of varying morphologies such as spherical, triangular, cubic and rod-like nanoparticles are used due
to the difference in surface area and active sites available which affect the catalytic and adsorption ability
[115]. Among these spherical AgNPs are used widely due to their uniform distribution and stability. These
nanoparticles provide moderate reactivity and are effective in adsorption-based removal [116]. Rod-shaped
AgNPs have enhanced surface area as compared to spherical AgNPs, which enhances its interaction with
organic pollutants like phenolic compounds. However, the efficiency of nanostructures depends on dispersion
stability [118]. Triangular and cubic AgNPs have high surface energy as they have more exposed facets,
therefore they tend to exhibit better catalytic and adsorptive properties as compared to spherical silver
nanoparticles [117]. Optimization of both morphology and size of AgNPs is essential for high efficiency in
phenolic removal.
Environmental factors such as pH and temperature greatly affect the efficiency of phenolic removal from the
water system with the use of AgNPs. The pH of the water system affects the surface properties of silver
nanoparticles and the chemical state of phenolic compounds [119]. Typically, slightly acidic to neutral

conditions (pH 5-7) increases the efficiency of phenol removal [121]. At high pH (basic) phenols tend to
ionize into phenolate anions, that has negative charges, as AgNPs often develop negative surface charge,
which may cause electrostatic repulsion that reduces adsorption efficiency [120]. Like pH, adsorption,
catalytic degradation and photocatalytic degradation of phenolic compounds is highly dependent on
temperature. At high temperature the kinetic energy of molecules increases which enhances their interaction
with AgNPs [121]. High temperatures with light exposure increase the removal efficiency of photocatalytic
degradation of phenol in the water system [122]. However, excessive temperature may destabilize AgNPs
which may lead to agglomeration and reduced surface area, thereby lowering efficiency of removal [123].
Other than pH and temperature the contaminants present in waste water alters the removal efficiency of
phenol. Organic pollutants such as humic acid and fulvic acid are dissolved in water that can compete with
phenol for adsorption sites on AgNPs [124]. These relatively large organic compounds from coating on the
surface of AgNPs reducing phenolic removal, by blocking the active sites [125] disrupting the catalytic
degradation of phenol and its derivatives in water. Some of the organic compounds like dyes, pesticides and
pharmaceuticals reacts with phenolic compounds or alters the surface charge of AgNPs which may lead to
unpredictable interaction that affects removal efficiency [126], heavy metals such as Pb2+, Ca2+ and Cd2+ may
catalytically reduce AgNPs, reducing their effectiveness [127]. Chlorides, sulfates and phosphates present in
water bodies may react with AgNPs to form insoluble compounds like AgCl and AgSO 4, that decreases the
available sites and surface area for phenol adsorptions [128].

5. Challenges and Future Perspectives
Environmental conditions such as high pH and high temperature may destabilize AgNPs and ionize phenol
into phenolate anions which may decrease the removal efficiency of phenol in waste water [120,121]. AgNPs
used in the removal of phenol and its derivatives when released into the environment have toxic effects on
mammals, non-mammals and plants. The toxic effects on mammals were studied in an experiment in which
Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to AgNPs of size 18 nm of dose concentration 2.9X10 6 particles cm-3.
This experiment resulted in lung inflammation and damage to respiratory system [129]. In another similar
study conducted by Kim et al. [130], Sprague-Dawley rats were ingested with AgNPs of size 60 nm which
are mixed with diet for 28 weeks, which resulted in accumulation of AgNPs in kidney. In an experiment
demonstrating the toxic effects of AgNPs on non-mammals, Zebrafish embryos were exposed to AgNPs of
size 11.6 nm ± 3.5 nm for 120 hours. This resulted in 100 percent mortality and malformation of embryonic
morphology [131]. A study on Lolium Multiflorum was conducted to evaluate the effects of AgNPs on plants
in which L. multiflorum was exposed to AgNPs of size 6nm with concentration 1- 4 mgL-1 for 7-21 days.
This study reported the decrease in root and shoot length [132].
Often the conventional methods used to synthesize AgNPs can be costly [133] and may require the use of
harmful chemical such as NaBH4 [134], dimethyl formamide (DMF) [135] and hydrazine [136] which acts
as strong reducing agents, that reduces silver ions to metallic silver. Hydrazine has been ranked as a potential
carcinogen by United Staes Environmental Protection Agency [137].
Other than that, AgNPs reacts with phenol and form other phenolic derivatives such as quinone which is
known to form covalent bonds with proteins, thus exhibiting adverse effects to humans [16]. Silver
nanoparticles need to be modified by metallic oxides like TiO2 [104] and ZnO [108,109] to enhance its
catalytic and photocatalytic degradation for the removal of phenol and its derivatives. If not combined with
organic or inorganic materials the removal efficiency of phenol is reduced [110].

Due to the toxicity related to the conventional chemical synthesis and high cost of physical synthesis of silver
nanoparticles, green synthesis which consist of microbial and plant mediated synthesis of AgNPs should be
promoted and considered. This method is based on the use of non-toxic, non-hazardous and biobased
compounds as reducing agents and reagents [138] which are biodegradable. In this microorganism or plant
extracts are used as reducing agents which traditionally have higher biodegradability and bioavailability than
conventionally used chemical reagents [139,140]. More research should be conducted to have a better
understanding of the mechanism of plant mediated synthesis of AgNPs. Plant extracts can naturally reduce
heavy metal ions such as Ag+ and can convert it to metallic Ag0 which then can be used to synthesize silver
nanoparticles [142]. These plant compounds are cost effective as the reagents used can act as both reducing
and capping agents therefore no additional chemical reagent like DMF [135] or PVP [139] is required, thus
reducing the cost [139,141] and toxicity of AgNPs as these chemical reagents used in conventional methods
can be hazardous to human health and environment. No additional medium is required to synthesize AgNPs
in plant mediated synthesis as the nanoparticles are synthesized and nucleated within the plant tissue [143].
Better understanding of microbial synthesis method especially viral mediated synthesis including TMV-bio
template synthesis of AgNPs is needed as it is used to synthesize 1-D silver nanoparticles [144,145]. These
1-D AgNPs owing to their larger surface area enhances the adsorption and catalytic reduction of phenol
[81,82]. Although other microbial methods such as fungi [146], bacteriogenic [139] and algae-mediated [147]
synthesis of AgNPs can be slow and time-consuming process affecting its scalability, it uses non-hazardous
reagents which can produce non-toxic biodegradable AgNPs that can reduce phenolic contamination in waste
water without having adverse effects on human health and environment. However, more studies should be
conducted to increase the scalability, stability and enhance the cost and time reduction of plant and microbial
mediated synthesis silver nanoparticles.
Nanocomposites such as AgNPs – TiO2 and AgNPs – ZnO are used widely as these metal oxides enhances
the photocatalytic activity of AgNPs [112]. These nanocomposites can significantly degrade phenolic
compound and can also be effective against Azo dyes which consist of organic compounds such as 4nitrophenol which not only has the odour problems but also reduces oxygen contents and blocks the sunlight
from reaching the aquatic system [8,9]. However, the AgNPs tends to leach from TiO 2 and ZnO over time
which may cause toxicity and reduce the photocatalytic efficiency. To prevent leaching of AgNPs from metal
oxide, stabilizers like silica and carbon-based materials should be used [148]. As the bandgap of ZnO and
TiO2 for visible light adsorption via SPR is wide [104,105] metal oxide should be doped with transition metal
such as Fe, Cu, Co to narrow the bandgap.

Conclusion
Phenol and its derivatives are organic compounds that are characterized by hydroxyl group attached to them.
These compounds are widely used in industrial application and are recognized for their presence in industrial
effluents of chemical industries, coal and gas industries, dye, textile and pharmaceutical industries. There
potential to cause significant environmental damage and heath issue due to their toxicity and persistence in
water has made the reduction and removal of phenolic derivatives a priority among researchers and scholars.
Among the industrial effluents dyes are major source of contaminants, Azo dyes form almost 70% of the total
water contamination which consist of 4-nitrophenol. These pollutants not only cause odour problems but also
it reduces oxygen in water bodies and blocks the sunlight. However, adsorption and catalytic degradation can
be used to reduce 4-nitropehol to 4-aminophenol by using AgNPs as catalyst. The phenolic contaminants are
majorly sourced by anthropogenic and natural sources. The anthropogenic sources involve effluents from
industrial sectors as phenol serves as a vital part of many products like paints, medicine, lubricants, herbicides
and pesticides. Natural sources which consist of dead plants, animals and microorganism also contributes in
phenolic contamination. These phenolic contaminants if not treated properly may be hazardous to humans

and may have adverse environmental impact. USEPA has categorized phenol and its derivatives such as
chlorophenols, nitrophenol and dimethylphenols as potential toxic pollutants that cause vomiting, skin
irritation and burning, they may also damage vital organs like kidney, lungs or liver. Silver nanoparticles due
to their high surface area and reactivity, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Surface enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) are used as a catalyst in Adsorption, Catalytic degradation and Photocatalytic degradation
of phenol from water system. Metal oxides such as TiO 2 and ZnO are used in phenolic degradation. These
mechanisms depends on factors such as size and morphology and environmental factors such as pH and
temperature. AgNPs of small size are ideal for removal of phenol as it has high surface area resulting in
increased number active sites for adsorption and catalytic degradation. Spherical nanoparticles are commonly
used. However, triangular and cubic AgNPs have greater removal efficiency, because of its high surface area.
Typically, slightly acidic to neutral pH (5-7 pH) is preferred for the removal of phenol from waste water, as
high pH may cause electrostatic repulsion. High temperature with light exposure enhances photocatalytic
degradation of phenol and its derivatives. Phenols are rarely found in isolation and are always with organic
and inorganic contaminants that might occupy the active sites on the surface of AgNPs, thus reducing the
efficiency of phenol removal.
AgNPs besides their ability to remove toxic phenolic contamination, when releases in the environment causes
toxicity as the AgNPs are itself non-biodegradable and toxic. These nanoparticles may accumulate in kidney
or other vital organs of mammals or adhere the growth of plants. The reducing agents used to synthesize
AgNPs in conventional methods may be toxic chemicals such as NaBH4 and hydrazine which are extremely
toxic and potentially carcinogenic. To avoid this more emphasis should be on the green synthesis of AgNPs
which includes plants and microbial mediated synthesis. Although these methods are time consuming but
their cost effectiveness and non-toxic nature makes them ideal for the synthesis of AgNPs to remove phenol
and its derivatives from water system.
