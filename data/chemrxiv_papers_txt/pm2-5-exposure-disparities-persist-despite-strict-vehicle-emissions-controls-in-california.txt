Abstract
As policymakers increasingly focus on environmental justice, a key question is whether

16

emissions reductions aimed at addressing air quality or climate change can also ameliorate
persistent air pollution exposure disparities. We examine evidence from California’s aggressive

18

vehicle emissions control policy from 2000-2019. We find a 65% reduction in modeled statewide
average exposure to PM2.5 from on-road vehicles, yet for people of color and overburdened

20

community residents, relative exposure disparities increased. Light-duty vehicle emissions are
the main driver of the exposure and exposure disparity, although smaller contributions from

22

heavy-duty vehicles especially impact some overburdened groups. Our findings suggest that a
continued trend of emissions reductions will likely reduce concentrations and absolute disparity

but may not reduce relative disparities without greater attention to the systemic factors leading to
this disparity.

Introduction
28

Despite decades of progress improving ambient air pollution in the United States (U.S.),
people of color still bear a disparate burden of air pollution (1–12). Within California, research

30

has quantified and characterized these exposure disparities using both measurements and models
(13–18). Solutions to this persistent inequality are increasingly a focus for academic research and

32

environmental policy at the federal, state, and local levels (9, 17–19). A growing body of
research investigates how air quality policies might contribute to a “triple win” that

34

simultaneously achieves meaningful benefits by reducing population-wide exposures; mitigating
greenhouse gas emissions; and reducing exposure disparities and extreme exposures (20, 21).

36

Here, we use a modeling framework to explore how multi-decade emission reductions shaped by
air quality and climate policies have affected environmental justice (EJ) outcomes, using

38

California’s aggressive on-road mobile source strategy as a case study. In this work, we focus on
exposure disparities, which can be distinct from disparities in health outcomes (22–27).

40

Recent research on how to reduce air pollution exposure disparities in the U.S. presents
two conflicting approaches (9, 19–21, 28). The first approach starts from the recognition that

42

many major emitting sectors lead to disparate exposures for people of color (2). Thus, focusing
on emissions reductions for sectors that especially impact people of color could have EJ co-

44

benefits (21, 29–32). This approach mirrors the policy structure in the U.S. and elsewhere, where
environmental regulations are targeted to individual economic sectors (e.g., vehicles, industries,

46

power plants) and tailored to relevant technology and infrastructure. The second body of research

suggests that sector-oriented policies may not be effective in addressing relative disparities in air
48

pollution. For example, optimization modeling found that aggressive nationwide emissions
reductions targeting economic sectors with higher-than-average disparity impact would not

50

eliminate racial-ethnic fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure disparities without nearly
eliminating emissions (9). In contrast, a location-specific approach – i.e., emissions-reductions

52

by location rather than by economic sector – rapidly eliminated disparities. Building upon this
finding, two recent studies (20, 21) simulated climate policies with substantial abatement of

54

PM2.5 and its precursors across most U.S. economic sectors and found modest potential
reductions in disparities. They too reported that “location-specific” policies that target emissions

56

reductions in all sectors within specific overburdened geographies may have high potential to
address relative exposure disparities even with small emissions changes (9, 19). To complement

58

prospective studies, which consider ways to reduce future exposure disparity, we examine the
disparity impacts of historical emissions trajectories. We focus on the transportation sector,

60

which is often highlighted as having high potential to reduce exposure disparities. Historically,
racist urban planning and infrastructure decisions (e.g., redlining, freeway siting) have

62

concentrated vehicle emissions in communities of color (2, 4, 7, 13, 29). Furthermore, people
who are exposed to the highest levels of traffic-related air pollution often are not the

64

communities who drive the most (30–32). As such, a recent study found that emissions controls
for the transportation sector have the greatest potential to mitigate racial-ethnic inequality in U.S.

66

air pollution (21). Simultaneously, the transportation sector is a priority area for regulatory
agencies and EJ-oriented community groups; emissions reductions from these sources could

68

potentially reduce exposure disparities, human health impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions
(33).

70

For nearly 60 years, California led the U.S. in reducing on-road vehicle emissions.
Because California’s motor vehicle emission regulation preceded the Clean Air Act of 1970,

72

California is delegated the authority to set vehicle emissions standards more stringently than the
federal equivalent (34–36). In the present analysis, we model exposure concentrations for the

74

years 2000 through 2019, during which California’s regulatory agencies pursued an aggressive
and interlinked suite of multi-pollutant policies to reduce emissions across the entire on-road

76

vehicle fleet (36). Examples include requiring cleaner fuels and technological advancements
(e.g., hybrid drivetrain, alternative fuel and propulsion technologies, advanced emissions

78

controls) specific to light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicle classes (respectively:
LDV, MDV, HDV).

80

The suite of regulations that comprise California’s mobile source strategy has resulted in
large aggregate reductions of emissions of multiple pollutants from diverse fleets that make up

82

the state’s on- and off-road vehicles (37). Here, we examine how changes in on-road vehicle
emissions from 2000 to 2019 have impacted exposure to PM2.5. Over this time period, on-road

84

emissions have been shaped by several aggressive state regulations targeting specific vehicle
fleets, including California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) Light-Duty Vehicle Emissions

86

Standards, Advanced Clean Cars, and the Truck and Bus Regulation (38). Despite statewide and
fleetwide on-road vehicle miles traveled increasing ~24% – from 292 billion (2000) to 364

88

billion (2019) – emissions of the four species that principally drive population-weighted PM2.5
exposures from on-road vehicles have decreased. Regulatory emissions data indicate reductions

90

of ~70% for primary PM2.5, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC),
while ammonia (NH3) decreased ~15% (Fig. S1) (38). Notably, non-exhaust primary PM2.5

92

emissions (e.g., brake- and tire-wear) have increased by ~20% over this time period, causing the
relative non-exhaust share of primary PM2.5 to increase substantially (14% to 50% from 20004

94

2019) (39). Diverse measurement and observational datasets (see SI) corroborate overall
declining emissions of PM, NOx, VOC, NH3, and other key traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs)

96

(40–50). Considering all species that contribute to total PM2.5, California’s on-road emissions
reductions outpaced the national aggregate, especially for NOx and VOC (51).

98

On-road vehicle emissions are anticipated to continue to decline in California in response
to major new regulations: Advanced Clean Cars II (starting in 2035, requires all new passenger

100

cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles) and Advanced Clean
Fleets (starting in 2045, all trucks that drive in California must use zero-emissions technology).

102

A few recent studies have projected the air pollution and equity impacts of vehicle electrification
in California and found limited equity benefit. In this paper, we build on a much smaller body of

104

work (14, 52) to focus retrospectively on the equity impacts of past changes in vehicle emissions
over two recent decades, with an eye to informing future policy.

106

We investigate whether the combined impacts of the ensemble of mobile source
strategies have contributed to a reduction in PM2.5 exposure disparities. Exposure disparities are

108

multifaceted; we quantify them along several axes described below. Our analysis also considers
two specific features (vehicle type; spatial scale) that are central to current regulatory design. We

110

conclude with implications from this California-focused retrospective analysis for future EJfocused policy for the U.S.

112

We developed and employed an open-source analysis method based on atmospheric
simulations from the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP, see Methods) to model total

114

PM2.5 concentrations resulting from emissions of PM2.5, NOx, VOC, NH3, and sulfur oxides
(SOx) emitted by California’s on-road mobile source sector from 2000 to 2019. Estimates of on-

116

road mobile emissions are from CARB’s Emission FACtor regulatory model (EMFAC v2021

with MPOv11), which has been approved by the U.S. EPA (53). EMFAC represents CARB’s
118

best estimate of on-road emissions; it incorporates detailed administrative and observational data
pertaining to fleet composition, emissions performance, and spatiotemporal activity patterns

120

(38). Variably sized gridded PM2.5 concentrations (1 km – 48 km, higher resolution in greater
population density locations) are combined with tract-level 2010 Census population data to

122

estimate exposure disparities among demographic groups (15). We disaggregate mobile source
impacts into four vehicle types: LDV, MDV, HDV, and all other vehicles (e.g., buses,

124

motorcycles, motorhomes; Table S1).
In the U.S. and in California, air pollution exposure disparities tend to be larger by race-

126

ethnicity than by other socioeconomic and demographic indicators (e.g., income, education,
urbanicity) due in large part to the historical racism and racist practices (e.g., housing

128

discrimination, redlining, highway relocation) that segregated cities and placed high-pollution
sources near communities of color (2–4, 10, 11, 54). Accordingly, we focus our analyses on

130

racial-ethnic disparities. In addition, we consider two statutory geographic designations (AB617,
SB535) of cumulative impacts that California uses for prioritizing EJ (Fig. S2) (55, 56).

132

Although these geographies have only recently been established (and thus past policy may or
may not have explicitly targeted these places), we focus on them here because they are an

134

example of location-specific policies that target emissions reductions in overburdened
communities. Through the Community Air Protection Program (AB617), California has

136

designated specific communities (2.7 M people, year-2010; 8.1% of the state’s population) for
priority in community-based air pollution monitoring and emissions reduction plans (55). A

138

second policy, SB535 (10.2 M people, 30.0% of the state’s population), focuses on targeting
financial investments towards people living in “disadvantaged communities”, identified using

140

several environmental, socioeconomic, and public health indicators for each US Census tract in
California (56, 57).

142

From here onwards, we use the term “overburdened communities” to refer specifically to
the areas designated as AB617 or SB535 communities and refer to the people that live in these

144

areas as “residents of overburdened communities.” The demographic makeup of residents of
overburdened communities has a higher proportion of people of color (all groups except for non-

146

Hispanic white Californians) than the statewide population (Table S2; people of color: 92.9% in
AB617 communities, 82.9% in SB535 communities). We also specifically consider exposure and

148

disparities experienced by individual racial-ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic Californians).
Results and Discussion

150

Statewide Trends in Overall Exposure and Relative Exposure Disparity
California’s mobile-source policy has succeeded in its overall goal of reducing PM2.5

152

exposures (Fig. 1A). We find that the modeled statewide population-weighted mean (PWM)
PM2.5 exposure concentration attributable to on-road vehicles decreased from approximately 3.2

154

to 1.1 μg/m3 from 2000 to 2019, a ~65% (i.e., nearly a factor-of-3) decrease in exposure on
average for all Californians. This reduction in PM2.5 exposure from on-road vehicles outpaced

156

the overall statewide improvement in ambient air quality (Fig. S3). For context, multiple
independent estimates of total PWM PM2.5 from all sources in California show an approximate

158

~40% decrease from 15 to 9 µg/m3 from 2000 to 2019 (58–60).
We evaluate PWM PM2.5 exposure from on-road mobile sources for racial-ethnic groups

160

and residents of overburdened communities (Fig. 1A). Our modeled estimate of PM2.5 declined
for all groups, and the ordering of exposures by group is generally consistent over time. Among

162

all racial-ethnic groups, Hispanic Californians experienced the highest exposure for all years,

with PWM exposure concentrations of approximately 3.5 and 1.3 μg/m3 PM2.5 in 2000 and 2019,
164

respectively. Black Californians experienced the next highest PWM exposure concentration
(respectively 3.5, 1.2 μg/m3 in 2000 and 2019), followed by Asian Californians (3.3, 1.2). Of the

166

four racial-ethnic groups in Fig. 1A, white Californians were exposed to the lowest PWM
concentrations: approximately 2.7 and 0.9 μg/m3 PM2.5 from 2000 and 2019, respectively.

168

Residents of overburdened communities were exposed to substantially higher PWM
concentrations of PM2.5 from on-road mobile sources (AB617 residents: 4.4, 1.6 μg/m3 in 2000

170

and 2019; SB535 residents: 4.1, 1.5 μg/m3 in 2000 and 2019) than the PWM for any racial-ethnic
group shown in Fig. 1A.

172

For each demographic group, we compute exposure disparity as the absolute (µg/m3) and
relative (percent) difference between the average modeled concentration experienced by a group

174

versus the overall state population (Fig. 1B, see also Methods and Table S3). In this work, we
discuss exposure disparities in both absolute and relative terms. Both metrics provide useful

176

insights into exposure inequality. Because increases in PM2.5 concentration have a causal
relationship with increases in adverse health outcomes, it is critical that absolute differences

178

between groups of people are minimized to the extent possible. However, systemic inequality in
terms of relative exposure disparity can persist even if the most overburdened areas receive the

180

largest reductions in exposure in absolute terms, if those reductions are not also the largest in
percentage terms. Crucially, our analyses focus exclusively on PM2.5 exposure disparities

182

attributable to on-road vehicles. Most other major emitting sectors in California also disparately
expose residents of overburdened communities and people of color to PM2.5 (2, 15). Likewise,

184

exposures to other air pollutants are also unequally distributed (4, 7, 10). Accordingly, when we
find that disparities persist, they persist in a larger story of environmental inequity in California.

186

Reflecting the nearly parallel exposure concentration traces over time evident in Fig. 1A,
relative disparities in PM2.5 exposure from on-road mobile sources (Fig. 1B) were strikingly

188

persistent, increasing slightly over this time period. The relative disparity in exposure to on-road
mobile sources for Hispanic Californians increased slightly from 12.0% (year-2000) to 13.9%

190

(year-2019) while the relative disparity in exposure for white Californians decreased slightly
from -13.5% to -15.5%. Thus, the overall relative difference between the most and least exposed

192

race-ethnicity increased from 30% to 35%. Given expected model uncertainties, these
incremental changes may not necessarily represent evidence of a trend that is distinguishable

194

from approximately constant relative disparity. Likewise, relative disparities for Black and Asian
Californians also persisted (respectively 10.5-11.5% and 5.4-6.2% over this period). Exposure

196

disparities by race-ethnicity are larger than by income (Fig. S4). Notably, we find persistent
disparities in exposure to both primary and secondary PM2.5 from vehicle emissions. Relative

198

disparities in exposure to primary PM2.5 components (18.6% for Hispanic Californians) were
larger than disparities in exposure to secondary PM2.5 (11.1% for Hispanic Californians).

200

Absolute and relative exposure disparities in overburdened communities are even larger.
For example, the relative disparity in exposure (i.e., relative to the overall population average)

202

for on-road mobile source PM2.5 is more than three times as large for AB617 communities as for
the most-exposed racial-ethnic group, increasing somewhat from 40% (year-2000) to 45% (year-

204

2019). Stratifying by CalEnviroScreen score (which is used in part to identify SB535
communities), we find even larger relative disparities (Fig. S4).

206

Disparities in exposure for those living at the extreme ends of the concentration
distribution are also relevant for understanding environmental injustice. We estimated

208

population-weighted distributions of exposure by race-ethnicity for each individual vehicle class
(Figs. S5-S6). In general, changes in exposure at the upper (i.e., 75th and 90th) percentiles are
9

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-669ws-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8339-927X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

210

consistent with changes in exposure at the PWM and consistent across time. Considering the
disparity in exposure at the 75th and 90th percentiles relative to the statewide mean, we find large

212

and increasing relative disparities (e.g., 90th percentile exposure for Hispanic Californians
increasing from 104% to 118% higher than statewide PWM from 2000 to 2019).

214

We also evaluated the degree to which the California populations who experience the
highest overall exposure to PM2.5 from on-road vehicles are disproportionately comprised of

216

people of color, and how this pattern has evolved over time. To do so, we binned the California
population by decile of modeled exposure to PM2.5, and then compared the racial-ethnic

218

composition of each decile in 2000 and 2019 (Fig. 2, midpoint result in Fig. S7). From 2000 to
2019, Hispanic Californians are overrepresented at the highest exposure deciles. While the

220

California state population is 37.6% Hispanic, the highest decile of exposure for emissions in
2000 and 2019 consists of 47.9% and 50.8% Hispanic people, respectively. Similarly, white

222

Californians, who comprise 40.1% of the population, are overrepresented among the populations
with the lowest exposures (62.0% of the lowest-exposure deciles in 2000 and 2019) and are

224

underrepresented in the highest-exposure decile (29.9% [2000], 27.7% [2019]). In Fig. S8, we
examine the racial/ethnic composition of the population across the full distribution of absolute

226

and percentage changes in PM2.5 exposure from on-road vehicles. While the grid cells with the
largest absolute reduction in concentration consist of more people of color than the statewide

228

average, there are only small demographic differences in the percentage change in exposure.
This result arises in large part because the geographies with the largest absolute reductions in

230

PM2.5 exposure from on-road mobile sources started out with the highest initial levels of
exposure in 2000.

232

Differences in Contributions to Exposure Disparity by Fleet Type

10

Because California’s vehicle emissions control policies generally differentiate by vehicle
234

types, we disaggregate our analyses of emissions, exposures, and disparities by vehicle type
based on the official EMFAC2021 documentation (Table S1) (38). We model the disparities and

236

additive contributions of each vehicle fleet type at the state-level for the most exposed racialethnic group, Hispanic Californians, to identify which vehicle types have an especially

238

influential role on their exposures and disparities.
At the statewide average, we find that that LDVs are the vehicle fleet with the largest

240

aggregate impact on overall PWM PM2.5 exposures and absolute disparities. For example,
considering Hispanic Californians, LDVs account for 65-70% of the 0.2-0.4 µg/m3 absolute

242

disparity in PM2.5 exposure from on-road mobile sources (Figs. 3A and 3B). Contributions to the
absolute disparity from HDVs (16-24%), MDVs (9-14%), and all other vehicles (<5%) are

244

substantially smaller. Considering the PWM distribution of PM2.5 by vehicle fleet type and race
ethnicity, we find broadly similar racial-ethnic distributions of exposure attributable to LDVs,

246

HDVs, and MDVs, with Hispanic Californians receiving the highest exposures (Fig. S5).
Between 2000-2019, the fractional contributions to absolute disparity from individual vehicle

248

fleet types were stable, likely reflecting the roughly constant distribution of vehicle activity
patterns by vehicle fleet.

250

From here on, we focus our discussion on LDVs and HDVs, which in combination
account for >80% of exposures and absolute disparities attributable to on-road sources (see Fig

252

S7 for detailed results for other fleets). The dominant influence of LDVs on exposure holds
across racial-ethnic groups and for residents of overburdened communities (Figs. S9-S10), but

254

with different overall magnitudes of exposure for different subpopulations. This result likely
arises for two reasons. First, LDVs dominate the overall emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors.

256

Based on the CARB emissions inventories employed, LDVs contribute most of the NH3 and
11

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-669ws-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8339-927X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

VOC emissions (70-95% of NH3, > 80% of VOC) from vehicles, which account for ~44-56% of
258

total PM2.5 exposure from vehicles. LDVs and HDVs contribute more similarly to primary PM2.5
(23-45% LDV, 29-56% HDV) and NOx (35-48% LDV, 36-43% HDV) emissions, and these

260

species contribute the remaining ~44-56% of total PM2.5 (Figs. S11-S14). Primary PM2.5
emissions are more weighted towards non-exhaust emissions in recent years, especially for

262

LDVs (Figs S11-S14). Second, LDV emissions are more concentrated near population centers
than other vehicle fleets, so LDVs result in a substantially higher-than-average exposure impact

264

(Fig. S15 metric: µg/m3 population-weighed exposure per ton of annual emissions; this metric is
directly related to intake fraction, e.g., 61–63).

266

While the high activity of LDVs causes a higher aggregate impact on disparity, HDVs
stand out as the fleet type whose emissions cause the most disparate impact on Californians of

268

color. As a complement to apportioning the overall absolute exposure disparity to emissions
from individual vehicle types (i.e., largest aggregate impact), in Fig. 3C we also consider which

270

vehicle fleet types have an especially disparate impact on specific racial-ethnic groups (largest
relative impact regardless of magnitude of emissions) relative to the statewide population. For

272

example, the relative disparity caused by HDVs for Hispanic Californians (range: 16 – 17%) was
larger than the relative disparity caused by LDVs (range: 11 – 14%). This difference in impacts

274

by fleet type is consistent with recent traffic equity modeling, which demonstrated that the
majority of Californians of all race-ethnicity are exposed to high annual average daily traffic

276

from LDVs, but Californians of color are disproportionately exposed to higher annual average
daily traffic from HDVs (64). Another useful metric for discussing the especially disparate

278

impact of HDVs is the exposure inequality, defined by Demetillo et al. (65) as the percent
difference in exposure between the most- and least-exposed racial-ethnic groups. Based on our

280

results the PM2.5 inequality for Hispanic Californians, relative to white Californians, increases
12

from 37% in 2000 to 41% in 2019. This finding complements recent work that shows the
282

importance of HDV emission mitigation for reducing racial-ethnic disparity (23, 65).
Substantial Heterogeneity in Fleet-wise Contributions at Community Scale

284

We find that there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in how different vehicle fleet types
contribute to PM2.5 exposures. We compare modeled contributions by vehicle type at four spatial

286

scales (Fig. 4): (A) statewide, (B) regional, (C) within overburdened communities, and (D)
community-scale. Whereas the previous section and Fig. 4C evaluate aggregate exposure and

288

disparity across all AB617 overburdened communities, in Fig. 4D we compare contributions to
exposure and disparity within individual overburdened communities. The primary goal of this

290

analysis is to highlight the heterogeneity among diverse communities in how vehicle fleets
contribute to PM2.5; our estimates are not meant to precisely capture community-scale pollution

292

concentrations. As with any emissions inventory, modeled concentrations are much more precise
with locally-validated, site-specific information that has been observationally verified (66). To

294

complement our high-level approach to understanding the heterogeneity in source contributions,
future community-specific analyses could employ higher spatial resolution modeling tools and

296

local emissions data to better represent the lived experience of individual communities.
On average, the Los Angeles area and its AB617 overburdened communities have high

298

PWM exposures and high contributions from LDVs (> 60%). In the Central Valley, while the
PWM exposures are lower, the contributions from HDVs are substantially higher (e.g., ~60% in

300

Arvin/Lamont). The diversity in fleet contributions to individual communities showcases the
importance of community-specific emissions reduction planning. While a community with a high

302

share of LDVs, for example, might benefit more from policy actions that directly reduce those
emissions (e.g., more electric bus routes, street conversion to bicycle paths), different strategies

304

may be more appropriate for a community dominated by HDVs (e.g., additional diesel fuel
emissions limits, truck electrification, low emission zones). These differences likely arise from

306

differences in spatial distributions of sources relative to residences and the magnitude and
mixtures of vehicle activity that occur at the community scale. In sum, our results support the

308

approach of enabling communities to identify and mitigate the largest contributors to local
exposures and disparities.

310

Validation, Limitations, and Implications for Future Research
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that our core qualitative results align with available

312

observational evidence. A relative strength of our modeling approach is that it allows us to model
temporal changes at sufficiently high spatial resolution that we can estimate exposure disparities

314

attributable to individual source categories. In contrast, a detailed longitudinal record of in-situ
observations is not available at sufficient spatial resolution to permit rigorous assessment of how

316

disparities in exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 have evolved. Nonetheless, CARB’s analyses of
ambient monitoring data from 1990-2014 align qualitatively with our results. These analyses of

318

monitoring data indicate declining concentrations of diesel PM, PM2.5, and NO2, but with
persistent relative and absolute disparities for the relatively sparse network of sites located in

320

overburdened communities (60).
As additional points of comparison for our modeled results, we examined datasets of

322

finely resolved satellite observations and empirical model predictions. These datasets afford the
ability to consider changes in exposure and disparity for the entire state (see Supplementary

324

Text) (58, 59). In Fig. S3, we compare our analyses with changes in total PM2.5 (only moderately
influenced by vehicles) and NO2 (strongly influenced by vehicles). Considering PWM

326

concentration changes from 2000-2019, our estimated PWM PM2.5 from on-road vehicles

declined at a broadly similar rate (~65%) compared to the results from a high-resolution
328

empirical model of PWM NO2 spatial patterns (~55%). Our estimates of the racial-ethnic
ordering of vehicle-emitted PM2.5 exposures and disparities closely match that from the total

330

PM2.5 and NO2 datasets. Crucially, our finding of temporally persistent relative disparities in
exposure to PM2.5 from on-road sources (Fig. 1B) is consistent with highly stable patterns of

332

relative disparity in total PM2.5 and NO2 for Californians of color (Fig. S3). Furthermore, we find
that the magnitude of our estimate of traffic-related PWM PM2.5 is consistent with the on-road

334

vehicle contribution from previous modeling and in-situ source apportionment studies in
California (67–72). In combination, these supporting lines of evidence reinforce our key

336

qualitative conclusion that exposures from mobile sources have decreased while relative
disparities in exposure have persisted.

338

It is worthwhile to consider possible uncertainties, biases, and limitations associated with
our approach. Our modeling framework is built around the InMAP reduced-complexity model

340

(73) and its associated InMAP source-receptor matrix (ISRM, 28). The computational efficiency
of this model enabled us to interactively execute thousands of unique model runs representing

342

distinct vehicle fleets for twenty individual years, while maintaining sufficiently fine scale (down
to 1 km2) to capture spatially sharp exposure disparities (1, 3). However, our modeling

344

approaches have notable limitations. First, as with any atmospheric modeling, our results rest on
the validity of underlying emissions inventories, including how they represent patterns over time

346

and space (e.g., 74), as discussed briefly below. Second, InMAP makes make simplifying
assumptions that can lead to somewhat higher bias than traditional chemical transport models

348

(CTMs), which model the underlying atmospheric chemistry and dynamics with higher fidelity.
One such simplification in our model is a linear approximation of non-linear secondary aerosol

350

chemistry. Third, temporal resolution of our results is limited to annual average conditions; we
15

do not quantify exposure disparities that occur on seasonal, diurnal, or shorter-than-annual time
352

scales, which are also relevant (75). Additionally, our model does not capture sub-grid-scale
exposure gradients near roads; those gradients can occur and are important for exposure

354

disparities at scales finer than 1 km (76). InMAP results are generally considered more robust for
spatial aggregations of many grid cells (e.g., air basins, groups of overburdened communities),

356

and less so for individual pixels or neighborhoods (73). Finally, our core analyses assign
exposures based on a fixed residential address (which can misclassify exposures, e.g., 77), and

358

were estimated using a temporally static year-2010 US Census dataset (selected as the midpoint
year of our study).

360

Considering that our key results emphasize the persistence over time of disparities
(especially relative disparities) – rather than absolute concentrations at specific locations – our

362

overarching qualitative insights are likely to be robust. Relative disparities are principally
determined by the interaction of fine-scale spatial patterns of demographics, roadways, and fleet

364

activity, and are less sensitive to the magnitude of emissions or concentrations. In the
supplementary materials (supplementary text section “Model Uncertainty and Sensitivity” and

366

Figs. S16-S17), we explore how possible biases in emissions estimates and model performance
could affect our results. We first review the literature to constrain our understanding of the

368

uncertainty from the state regulatory model of on-road mobile source emissions estimates (50,
74). From previous work validating EMFAC’s on-road mobile source emission factors and a

370

similar model’s activity-based spatial surrogates, we believe our qualitative insight is unlikely to
be affected by bias in the emissions inventory. We then perform four tests to evaluate the

372

sensitivity of our analyses to potential biases in the emissions and model (Fig. S16). A key
insight is that within the range of expected model biases for InMAP, we find that the magnitude

374

and ordering of relative disparities is only minimally sensitive. This result arises in part because
16

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-669ws-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8339-927X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

relative disparities involve ratios of modeled concentration estimates. In addition, because we
376

find meaningful disparities for each of the five modeled PM2.5 constituents, pollutant-specific
model biases (representing, for example, a possible mischaracterization of the non-linear

378

chemistry in InMAP) are unlikely to strongly skew our results (see Fig. S16). Likewise, this
analysis implies that inventory biases that affect aggregate level of emissions are unlikely to

380

affect our core insights. We show that our results are robust against spatial biases in the
emissions inventory by repeating our analysis with emissions from two independently derived,

382

peer-reviewed emissions inventories (78, 79) and coarser representations of our emissions
inventory. Spatial emissions biases in the inventory could conceivably affect conclusions about

384

relative disparities if they were much larger than what we explored in Fig. S16. However, we
consider this implausible given how closely our results align with disparity insights from high-

386

resolution NO2 predictions (Fig. S3). Nonetheless, because neither EMFAC nor InMAP are
meant to authoritatively describe emissions and concentrations in individual model pixels, we

388

ascribe our greatest confidence to overall patterns in space and time, but caution against overinterpreting results for specific communities or other small regions. Finally, in a sensitivity

390

analysis (Fig. S17), we repeated our analysis with 2000 Decennial Census data. These analyses
indicate that our core qualitative finding of highly persistent relative disparity was generally not

392

sensitive to the selection of census dataset. In particular, the choice of which demographic
dataset is used minimally affected the PWM concentrations and relative disparities experienced

394

by overburdened communities and individual racial-ethnic groups in California. However, future
demographic shifts in the California population that substantially alter patterns of social

396

segregation could meaningfully affect aggregate air pollution disparities at the state level. For
example, if suburbs become more racially integrated and California’s population becomes

17

398

increasingly diverse, relative disparities could decrease as a function of demographic changes
and not necessarily emissions mitigation.

400

Future research beyond the scope of this assessment could further corroborate our
findings and build on our results. First, CTM simulations could usefully validate our core results,

402

especially as they concern the behavior of secondary PM2.5 from vehicle emissions. Second, it
would be helpful to quantify the effect of decades of vehicle emissions controls on other air

404

pollutants that are relevant to the health of overburdened communities, including nitrogen
oxides, diesel PM, and air toxics. Third, although in-situ observations of TRAPs have

406

historically not been available at sufficiently high spatial resolution to systematically
characterize changes in disparity, careful analysis of data at particular locations may be able to

408

complement our statewide insights. Moreover, as hyperlocal measurements of traffic-related air
pollutants become more widespread, these types of observational studies may be more feasible in

410

the future.
Finally, because disparities in terms of health outcomes are also relevant to EJ and

412

distinct from exposure disparities, analyses that quantify the complex interplay of emissions,
exposures, and social, demographic, and epidemiological factors could explore the impact of

414

vehicle emissions on environmental health disparities over time (22, 23, 25–27, 80–83).
Disparities in health outcomes are strongly influenced by social determinants of health (e.g., age,

416

obesity, access to health care, criminal justice) that have persisted over time and are independent
of air pollution (80, 84). Several recent studies show that Black and Hispanic Americans in the

418

US have higher susceptibility to air pollution than non-Hispanic white Americans (81–83, 85).
Thus, a focus on disparities in exposure may underestimate or mischaracterize the ultimate

420

disparities in health outcomes (22–27). While this study focused exclusively on exposure
disparities, effective policies should address disparities in both exposure and health outcomes.

Policy Insights from California’s Historical Mobile Vehicle Control Policies
We have demonstrated that while modeled PWM PM2.5 exposures and absolute exposure-

424

disparities attributable to on-road mobile sources have decreased over the past two decades
across all population groups, relative disparities have remained at both the average and at the

426

extreme ends of the exposure distribution for Californians of color and residents of overburdened
communities. Emissions from LDVs and HDVs impact disparities in different ways. LDVs

428

contribute the most to PM2.5 concentrations and absolute disparity, while emissions from HDVs
most disproportionately expose people of color relative to other fleet types, thereby highlighting

430

the importance of mitigating emissions from both vehicle types. Of the groups considered here,
residents of AB617 communities in aggregate experience the highest levels of PM2.5 exposure

432

from on-road vehicles, although PWM exposures for these residents has declined by over 60%
since 2000. There is substantial heterogeneity among AB617 communities in terms of the total

434

exposure concentration and the relative contribution from each vehicle type.
Our finding of highly persistent relative disparities for Californians of color is

436

disappointing but consistent with a growing body of literature on sectoral emissions policy.
When policies reduce the overall emissions rate without substantially altering the pattern of

438

where emissions occur, relative disparities in exposure can persist (9, 14, 21). In this vein, the
findings from our retrospective analysis resonate with results of studies that have prospectively

440

modeled the potential future equity impacts associated with specific vehicle policies (e.g., heavyduty truck electrification, zero-emission vehicle adoption). Consistently with those studies, we

442

have found large absolute concentration changes in regions with the highest share of people of
color, yet we nonetheless find minimal reduction in the relative disparity for PM2.5 exposure (14,

444

23, 25, 52, 86). These results arise because the places with the largest concentration changes over
time tend to be the places most impacted by vehicles (Fig. S8).

446

While the sustained inequity in PM2.5 exposure resulting from on-road mobile sources is
problematic, California’s mobile source strategy has led to large aggregate reductions in

448

emissions, exposure concentrations, and absolute disparities. Although relative disparity in
exposure to PM2.5 from on-road mobile sources is effectively unchanged for Californians of

450

color and residents of overburdened communities, the PWM PM2.5 exposures caused by these
mobile sources reduced by approximately 64% for all demographic groups considered during our

452

study. On-road mobile source controls have also reduced emissions from a broad suite of TRAPs
(87) that are also of health concern. For example, statewide on-road emissions of carbon

454

monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and diesel PM also decreased by ~ 75% (38, 39). Ambient
concentrations of these pollutants have declined substantially in absolute terms, especially at

456

sites in overburdened communities (60). These results speak to the value of both aggressive
mobile source control and a multi-pollutant mitigation strategy that considers multiple TRAPs at

458

once. Future mitigation efforts should continue this approach to avoid the risk of unintended
consequences of single-pollutant control strategies (52). Despite this success, it is likely that

460

relative disparities for other pollutants with similar spatial patterns of on-road emissions have
persisted. Consider for example NOx, for which on-road sources contributed 57% of total

462

statewide emissions in 2000. From 2000-2019, our assessment of high-resolution empirical
model predictions shows a ~55% decrease in PWM NO2, but large and moderately increasing

464

relative disparities by race-ethnicity (Fig. S3).
It is useful to consider the implications of our retrospective assessment for California’s

466

current policy efforts that focus heavily on eliminating exhaust emissions across the on-road fleet
through a combination of electrification and – in the case of HDVs – hydrogen. For every year of

468

the study, approximately 90% or more of the PWM PM2.5 exposure (and absolute exposure
disparity) is attributable to exhaust emissions and approximately 80% or more is attributable to
20

470

secondary formation from precursor exhaust emissions (Fig. S11-S14). Because California’s
policies contemplate eliminating exhaust emissions, this result implies that future vehicle

472

electrification has potential to substantially reduce exposures and absolute disparity.
Nonetheless, PWM exposure to non-exhaust primary PM2.5 emissions (i.e., brake- and tire-wear)

474

increased somewhat from 2000-2019 (Fig. S18), while relative disparities from non-exhaust
primary PM2.5 remained effectively constant. Non-exhaust emissions would not be fully

476

eliminated through electrification and could conceivably be exacerbated by increases in vehicle
mass (88). Thus, future low levels of exposure from non-exhaust emissions (e.g., brake- and tire-

478

wear) might still disparately affect people of color and residents of overburdened communities.
Our results suggest that relative disparities in exposure will persist without a paradigm

480

shift in transportation policy. Some policy approaches have the potential to not merely reduce
aggregate levels of exposure, but also relative disparities. For example, creating low emissions

482

zones or promoting mode shift away from private automobiles (e.g., dense public transit
networks, bike lane infrastructure) could be more likely to reduce exposure disparities from the

484

on-road vehicle fleet than statewide fleet-specific emissions controls, while also improving air
pollution throughout the system (89). Without systemic changes to transportation infrastructure,

486

it seems possible that these relative disparities could persist even in a future, lower emission
scenario. Conversely: by strategically accelerating emission-reductions, such as vehicle

488

electrification efforts, with deployment emphasizing overburdened areas, EJ communities could
achieve substantial short-term reductions in relative exposure disparity.

490

While we have focused on one sector within California, our findings contribute to an
emerging body of EJ research indicating that to reduce relative disparities in exposure, policy

492

must not merely continue a trend of emissions reduction, but also target the disparate
geographical distribution of emissions in overburdened communities. While we focused on

494

California as a case study, it is possible that these general findings would apply across the United
States, as most state and national approaches broadly have mirrored California’s, with a strong

496

focus on emission rate reductions. Our work provides a compelling illustration of how a highly
successful emissions reduction strategy does not necessarily reduce relative disparity in

498

exposures (20, 21). More research is needed to identify the specific suite of strategies that can
deliver a “triple win” for climate, health, and equity goals. We hypothesize that particularly

500

effective strategies may go beyond aggregate emission rate reductions by ameliorating the
inequitable spatial distribution of where activities and emissions take place. Thus, future work

502

could explore the environmental equity impacts of potential policy actions and public
investments that fundamentally change transportation infrastructure.

504

Methods
Emissions Estimates

506

We obtained estimates of mobile emissions in California from CARB’s EMission FACtor
(EMFAC) model (version EMFAC 2021 with MPOv11) for calendar years 2000 through 2019

508

(38). The EMFAC model uses detailed California-specific data to estimate emissions by year and
fleet and has been approved by the US EPA (53). Estimated emissions were spatially allocated to

510

a 1 km by 1 km grid using surrogates developed by CARB and CARB’s Spatial and Temporal
Allocator (ESTA) model. The ESTA model uses spatial surrogates that are derived from link-

512

level traffic measurement data combined with population estimates and spatial information about
idling locations, rest stops, and distribution centers (90). The resulting dataset contained spatially

514

resolved annual total exhaust, evaporative, brake wear, and tire wear emissions for primary PM2.5
and four precursor species: NOx, VOC, NH3, and SOx. EMFAC2021 reports results for 54

516

vehicle categories and five fuel types (gasoline, diesel, natural gas, plug-in hybrid, and electric).
Emissions for this analysis were binned into three main vehicle groups: LDVs, MDVs, and
22

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-669ws-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8339-927X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

518

HDVs, with all other vehicle types (including motorcycles, motorhomes, and buses) grouped
together as “Other” (Table S1). Fleet information is derived from detailed data from the

520

California Department of Motor Vehicles, the California Highway Patrol, the International
Registration Plan Clearinghouse, and the National Transit Database (38). EMFAC is therefore

522

capable of providing a reasonable representation of distinct activity and emissions patterns for
specific vehicle fleets.

524

Estimates of Air Concentrations
We modeled annual average PM2.5 concentrations attributable to vehicle emissions in

526

California using the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) Source-Receptor Matrix
(ISRM)(15, 28, 73). The ISRM was developed from the United States InMAP, which used WRF-

528

Chem simulations and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Emissions Inventory
(NEI) emissions estimates for 2014. The national version of InMAP was sampled on a

530

population-weighted, variably-sized grid (n = 21,705; 1 km to 48 km) for the state of California
(15). Approximately 74% of grid cells are the finest resolution, with a population-weighted grid

532

size of 2.4 km (urban: 1.2 km, rural: 7.4 km). The gridding algorithm ensures that no cell larger
than 1 km contains more than 20,000 people or a census block group with population density

534

higher than 2,500 people/km.
The ISRM relates, for the n = 21,705 grid cells in California, marginal changes in ground-

536

level concentration in every grid cell to marginal changes in emissions in every cell. Because this
work only evaluates impacts from on-road mobile sources, all concentrations were estimated

538

using the ground-level (i.e., 0 – 57 m above ground) layer.
Open-Source Method: ECHO-AIR

540

Air pollution modeling, even with reduced complexity modeling tools such as InMAP, can
have major accessibility barriers for non-specialists. For the present analysis, we developed an
23

542

open-source Python-based pipeline that streamlines exposure concentration and health impact
analyses. The resulting system, called Estimating Concentrations and Health Outcomes –

544

Automated ISRM Resource (ECHO-AIR), aims to lower barriers of entry for rapid estimation of
PM2.5 exposure and health assessments.

546

Executing ECHO-AIR for analyses in California requires only estimates of emissions,
which can be input as ArcGIS-compatible shapefiles or comma separated value files. ECHO-

548

AIR is modular, enabling users to employ any ISRM, population data, and health input data, so
long as they are formatted correctly ECHO-AIR is managed through a public GitHub repository

550

to ensure transparency, to maximize usability, and to perform routine model upgrades and
maintenance (see Supplementary Text for details).

552

Population Estimates
We obtained population data for the years 2000 and 2010 from the decennial United States

554

Census for California from the National Historic Geographic Information System (NHGIS)
database version 16.0 (91). Population estimates were queried at the tract level by age, race, and

556

Hispanic origin. Consistent with prior literature (4, 8, 9), racial-ethnic categories were estimated
as follows: the population count for Hispanic Californians was defined as Californians of any

558

race who were of Hispanic origin; Californians who are not of Hispanic origin and are Black or
African American alone, Asian alone, or white alone were defined as Black, Asian, and white

560

Californians, respectively; all other Californians were included in the other category.
Exposure Assessment and Disparity Analysis

562

We estimated statewide group-level exposures to annual average PM2.5 as populationweighted mean (PWM) concentrations, consistent with the air pollution disparity literature (3, 8,

564

9, 19). For the metrics below, we consider only on-road mobile source exposure (i.e., we neglect
contributions from other source types unless explicitly stated otherwise). To estimate exposure to
24

566

PM2.5 for each year, we calculate geographic intersections between the 2010 Census tract
boundaries and the gridded concentration estimates. Population is down-sampled based on area-

568

apportionment; concentration estimates are assumed to be constant throughout the grid cell.
Exposure concentrations are calculated at the smallest geography possible (e.g., polygon

570

intersection of Census tract and ISRM grid cell).
The PWM exposure is estimated by multiplying the annual average PM2.5 concentration by

572

the population of the demographic group of interest within that grid cell, summing across all grid
cells, and dividing by the total population:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 =

574

∑𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘 ×𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖
∑𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘

where PWMk is the population-weighted mean exposure concentration for group k across n
576

grid cells, Pi,k is the population of group k in grid cell i, and Ci is the concentration of PM2.5 in
grid cell i. Equity was assessed using the absolute and relative disparities at the population-

578

weighted mean. The absolute disparity (DA,k) is defined as a demographic group’s populationweighted mean exposure (PWMk) subtracted by the statewide population-weighted mean

580

582

exposure (PWMT):
𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴,𝑘𝑘 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇

Relative disparities (DR,k) are estimated as the absolute disparity divided by the statewide
PWM exposure to mobile sources.

584

𝐷𝐷𝑅𝑅,𝑘𝑘 =

(𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇 )
𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴,𝑘𝑘
=
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇

Because the ISRM is a linear model and the absolute disparity is an arithmetic equity
586

metric, absolute disparities can be apportioned to individual source categories to find a relative
contribution to the absolute disparity. Thus, the fractional contribution of a source’s emissions to

588

a group’s exposure is estimated as:

590

𝑓𝑓𝑗𝑗,𝑘𝑘 =

𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴,𝑗𝑗,𝑘𝑘
𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴,𝑡𝑡,𝑘𝑘

where fj,k is the fractional contribution from source j on the exposure and disparity for group k,
DA,j,k is the absolute disparity from source j for group k, and DA,t,k is the absolute disparity for

592

group k from all on-road mobile sources.

Fig. 1. On-road mobile-source PM2.5 exposure and relative disparity in exposure for each
demographic group. Statewide population-weighted mean PM2.5 exposure concentrations (A)
and relative disparity in exposure (B) attributable to on-road mobile sources for the four largest
racial-ethnic groups and two policy-relevant environmental justice areas in California. In each
year, relative exposure disparities (B) for each racial-ethnic group are computed in reference to
statewide average PM2.5 concentration attributable to on-road mobile sources. Concentrations in
overburdened communities designated under California’s Community Air Protection Program
(AB617, ~10% of state population) and as SB535 Disadvantaged Communities (~25% of state
population) substantially exceed those experienced on average for the most-exposed racial-ethnic
group, Hispanic Californians. Crucially, despite greater than 50% reductions in mobile-source
population-weighted mean PM2.5 for all groups (A), relative racial-ethnic disparities increased
for Hispanic, Black, and Asian Californians, as well as residents of overburdened communities.
Here and elsewhere, the “Hispanic” population reflects Californians of any racial group
identifying on the US Census as Hispanic, while all other groupings exclude Californians
identifying as Hispanic.

Fig. 2. Racial-ethnic population distribution by exposure decile. Differences in racial-ethnic
composition of the California population exposed to each decile of the distribution of PM2.5
attributable to on-road mobile sources in (A) 2000 and (B) 2019. The statewide population is
binned into ten groups of equal population of PM2.5 exposure attributable to the full vehicle fleet.
At all years in our assessment, Hispanic Californians are strongly overrepresented among the
highest PM2.5 exposure deciles (and under-represented in the lowest exposure deciles). The
opposite pattern holds for white Californians. Data are plotted for individual vehicle types and
the analysis midpoint year (2010) in the SI.

Fig. 3. Contributions to disparity in exposure to mobile-source PM2.5 for Hispanic
Californians. Two methods of comparing contributions to disparity in PM2.5 exposures from onroad vehicle fleet types shown for the most exposed racial-ethnic group, Hispanic Californians.
First, we compare the absolute magnitude in contribution from each vehicle group (A, B); then,
we compare the relative disparity in exposure to each vehicle group (C). (A) Absolute disparities
in PM2.5 exposure from vehicles for Hispanic Californians relative to the overall statewide
population declined between 2000 and 2019, consistent with the overall reduction in emissions
(Fig. S1) and population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations (Fig. 1). (B) Fractional
contributions to the overall disparity that are attributable to each fleet type are estimated by
normalizing the absolute contribution to disparity attributable to a single fleet type to the total
disparity attributable to all on-road mobile sources. In each year, light-duty vehicle (LDVs)
emissions are the dominant contributor to the disparately high exposures experienced by
Hispanic Californians. (C) Disparities attributable to emissions of individual vehicle fleet types
relative to the statewide average PM2.5 exposure attributable to emissions of that individual
vehicle fleet. Note that heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) especially disparately impact Hispanic
Californians, even though HDVs are not the dominant contributor to overall emissions (Fig. S1),
PM2.5 concentrations (Fig. 1), or absolute disparities (C).

Fig. 4. Spatial heterogeneity in contributions by fleet to mobile-source PM2.5 exposure.
Contribution to PM2.5 exposures from distinct vehicle fleets is shown at four spatial scales: (A)
statewide, (B) three major regions, (C) residents of overburdened communities, and (D) for 19
individual communities designated by the state of California through the Community Air
Protection Program (AB617; see Fig. S2 for identification of each community). At each spatial
scale, pie chart icons indicate the fractional contribution to exposure attributable to each vehicle
fleet type, with icons scaled in proportion to the population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentration
from all vehicle types. Light-duty vehicles contribute especially to mobile-source PM2.5
exposures in Southern California, while the relative contribution from MDVs and especially
HDVs are comparatively higher in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay Area. There is
considerable heterogeneity among AB617 communities in fleet contributions.
