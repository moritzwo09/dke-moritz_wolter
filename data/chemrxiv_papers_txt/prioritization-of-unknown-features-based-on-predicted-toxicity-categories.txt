Abstract

2

Complex environmental samples contain a diverse array of known and unknown

3

constituents. While Liquid Chromatography coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spec-

4

trometry (LC-HRMS) Non-Targeted Analysis (NTA) has emerged as an essential tool

5

for the comprehensive study of such samples, the identification of individual con-

6

stituents remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the vast number of detected

features in each sample. To address this, prioritization strategies are frequently em-

8

ployed to narrow the focus to the most relevant features for further analysis.

9

In this study, we developed a novel prioritization strategy that directly links frag-

10

mentation and chromatographic data to aquatic toxicity categories, bypassing the

11

need for individual compound identification. Given that features are not always well-

12

characterized through fragmentation, we created two models: 1) a Random Forest Clas-

13

sification (RFC) model, which classifies fish toxicity categories based on MS1, reten-

14

tion, and fragmentation data—expressed as cumulative neutral losses (CNLs)—when

15

fragmentation information is available, and 2) a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

16

model that relies solely on retention time and MS1 data when fragmentation is absent.

17

Both models demonstrated accuracy comparable to structure-based prediction meth-

18

ods. We further tested the models on a pesticide mixture in a tea extract measured by

19

LC-HRMS, where the CNLs-based RFC model achieved 0.76 accuracy and the KDE

20

model reached 0.61, showcasing their robust performance in real-world applications.

This study presents a novel prioritization strategy for LC-HRMS NTA, which directly links

chromatographic and fragmentation data to the activity of unknown features, bypassing the

need for their identification

Introduction

26

The increasing number and variety of produced chemicals hinders the investigation and

27

assessment of their exposure levels and impacts on human and environmental health. 1–3

28

Only specific groups of chemicals are routinely monitored as a regulatory measure, therefore,

29

limiting the exposure assessment by excluding a diverse mixture of chemicals. 4,5 In order to

30

investigate chemical exposure realistically, accounting for the diversity of structures and their

31

properties in samples necessitates the application of unbiased approaches. 5–7

32

A major portion of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is covered by semi-polar

33

and polar organic compounds. 8,9 High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry coupled with

34

reverse phase liquid chromatography (LC-HRMS) is a well-known technique to analyze such

35

chemicals. 9,10 To limit the bias towards a small set of standardized analytes, the LC-HRMS

36

nontargeted (NTA) approach has been successfully developed and employed in environmen-

37

tal studies. 11–16 NTA does not require prior knowledge of the chemicals present in a sample

38

and enables the analysis of all detectable compounds. However, the complex nature of en-

39

vironmental samples results in highly convoluted data, requiring careful and robust prepro-

40

cessing. 17–20 Generally the number of detected features in NTA—data points constructed by

41

retention time, chromatographic peak intensity, and m/z of precursor ions—often counts in

42

the hundreds or thousands, though typically fewer than 5% of these can be identified. 19,21–23

43

Confident identification of detected features requires considerable computational and

44

research resources. 17,23,24 Therefore, prioritization is used as strategy to focus the available

45

resources on the most relevant features for a given study’s objectives. 25 The prioritized

46

species of interest undergo more detailed and thorough investigation. There are two ways of

47

prioritization: online and offline. Online prioritization refers to a variety of parameters to

48

acquire the data, e.g. to perform data-dependent acquisition, 25 consequently, limiting the

49

acquired data according to predefined parameters. 21 On the other hand, offline prioritization

50

strategies employ post hoc analysis of MS1 and MS2 (both data-dependent (DDA) and

51

data-independent (DIA) acquisition) data, including intensity-based prioritization, statistical

52

analysis, structural, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) evaluation. 6

53

The online approach results in a cleaner dataset for further processing with the risk of losing

54

valuable information about highly relevant features. Thus, the offline approach is more

55

advantageous for environmental studies and can also be used for retrospective studies. 26

56

Environmental studies primarily focus on the properties and potential activities of de-

57

tected chemicals, including their ecological toxicity. 27,28 As a result, prioritization strategies

58

often aim to highlight features that may pose significant (eco)toxicological risks. 29 For ex-

59

ample, Peets et al. developed the MS2Tox R package, which uses a regression model to

60

predict toxicity (-[LOG(mM)]) for organisms like fish, water fleas, and algae. 30,31 Similarly,

61

Rahu et al.. developed an algorithm to predict endocrine-disrupting activity using binary

62

or multi-label classification, 32 while Arturi and Hollender created MLinvitroTox, a tool to

63

classify chemicals as toxic or non-toxic based on nearly 400 target-specific and over 100

64

cytotoxic endpoints. 33

65

All these studies rely on predicting molecular formulas and fingerprints from MS2 spectra

66

using tools like CSI:FingerID/SIRIUS. 34 Therefore, the accuracy of these models is closely

67

tied to the precision of the predicted molecular fingerprints. Incorrectly calculated finger-

68

prints can significantly distort the predictions, and this accuracy can be compromised by var-

69

ious experimental factors, such as incomplete fragment detection, false positive fragments, or

70

missing characteristic fragments due to instrumental noise. Bypassing the molecular finger-

71

print prediction and instead predicting chemical activity directly from chromatographic and

72

MS data potentially reduces this uncertainty and enhances the interpretability of results.

73

Aquatic toxicity has been shown to be related to hydrophobicity of the chemicals, their

74

molecular weights and structural alerts. 35–37 Each detected feature indirectly includes struc-

75

tural information: chromatographic retention times and mass spectral (MS) information,

76

like accurate mass (MS1) and fragmentation spectra (MS2). Therefore, this information can

77

be used to assess the toxicity of the chemicals without any knowledge of molecular structure,

78

formula or fingerprint.

79

In this study, we developed a prioritization strategy based on acute aquatic toxicity using

80

chromatographic and fragmentation information of unknown features. Instead of identify-

81

ing each feature, we directly described their activity without any knowledge of molecular

82

structure. We constructed two models: a Random Forest Classification (RFC) model to

83

assign toxicity categories based on fragmentation data, and a Kernel Density Estimation

84

(KDE) model to determine the probability of features belonging to specific toxicity classes.

85

These algorithms allow us to characterize unknown features at both the mass spectral and

86

chromatographic levels. The performance of the constructed models was evaluated both on

87

spectra from databases with measured toxicity values and on tea extracts spiked with 253

88

pesticide standards.

89

Methods

90

Since fragmentation information in NTA is often incomplete, we developed a probabilistic

91

algorithm to predict toxicity categories that relies solely on chromatographic data, specifi-

92

cally retention time and MS1 spectra. This algorithm uses KDE in both the retention and

93

mass domains to identify regions of chromatograms that are more likely to correspond to

94

higher or lower toxicity, effectively mapping toxicity. Additionally in the presence of reliable

95

fragmentation data, the CNLs-based RFC model can be applied to categorize toxicity based

96

on detected fragments.

97

Overall workflow

98

To develop the models we employed a semi-supervised approach. First, a structure-based

99

classification model was built using an experimentally generated acute fish toxicity dataset

100

and molecular fingerprints. This model was then used to expand toxicity knowledge by

101

predicting the toxicity category for chemicals from large, existing spectral and environmen-

102

tally relevant databases. The CompTox dataset 38 was used to develop a KDE model, while

103

for the CNLs-based model, HRMS spectra were collected from sources such as MassBank,

104

MoNa, GNPS, and NIST. 39–42 Finally, the results of the developed models were compared

105

and validated using an experimentally acquired pesticide mixture in a tea extract (Figure

106

1).

Figure 1: Overall workflow. A structure-based model was developed using a fish toxicity
dataset and molecular fingerprints (FPs). This FPs-based model was then applied to the
CompTox and Spectral databases, incorporating additional information such as molecular
weight (MW) and retention indices (RI). A KDE-based model was constructed based on
this data. Furthermore, fragmentation information (i.e., characteristic neutral losses,
CNLs) was integrated to develop a CNLs-based model.

107

Datasets

108

For the model development, validation, and testing we employed four different datasets

109

namely: a set of experimental acute fish toxicity values - referred to as the fish toxicity data

110

set, the CompTox dataset, a Cumulative Neutral Loss (CNL) dataset, and experimentally

111

acquired LC-HRMS chromatogram of standard pesticide mixture in tea extracts - referred

112

to as pesticide mixture dataset.

113

Fish toxicity dataset

114

The fish toxicity dataset used in this study was compiled from two sources: Cassotti et al. 43

115

and Schür et al. 44 These sources are themselves compilations of numerous empirical studies,

116

relying on data collected from a wide range of experiments. The dataset includes concen-

117

tration values, expressed in LOG(mg/L), representing the dose that causes 50% mortality

118

in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) over a 96-hour exposure period (LC50). In total

119

1047 chemicals in the dataset come from various chemical families, including pharmaceuti-

120

cals, pesticides, conventional persistent organic pollutants, and industrial chemicals. 45 Due

121

to the inherent variability in in vivo experiments, where results can vary even under identi-

122

cal conditions, the dataset includes multiple repeated measurements for each chemical. The

123

median value from these repetitions was used as the reference LC50 value for each compound.

124

The CompTox dataset

125

The CompTox Chemicals Dashboard, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

126

(EPA), is a vast database that has been curated over 15 years through both manual and

127

automated efforts as part of the EPA’s DSSTox project. It contains detailed information

128

on 764,590 chemicals (as of March 2024), including identifiers such as CAS numbers and

129

SMILES, synonyms, and key properties like solubility, logKow, and molecular weight. Ad-

130

ditionally, it provides data on physicochemical characteristics, environmental fate, exposure,

131

usage, and available toxicity results from both in vivo and in vitro studies. For our purposes,

132

the CompTox dataset was filtered to exclude salts, metalloids, and compounds containing

133

elements not typically found in fish toxicity datasets or not analyzable via reverse phased

134

liquid chromatography (RPLC), leaving only chemicals composed of H, B, C, N, O, F, Si,

135

P, S, Cl, Br, and I.

136

CNLs dataset

137

The CNLs were used in place of fragments to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset

138

while retaining the structural information embedded in the spectra. The CNLs dataset was

139

generated from entries in the MassBank EU, MoNA, GNPS, and NIST20 databases. These

140

entries were obtained using electrospray ionization (positive mode) with a mass resolution of

141

≥ 5000, proton adducts, and included data from various mass analyzers (e.g., Q-TOF and

142

Orbitrap) with different collision energies. To ensure data quality, only spectra with at least

7

143

three recorded fragments were included. When multiple spectra were available for a single

144

compound, they were merged using a ±0.01 Da mass window, yielding 21026 unique spectra.

145

Rare fragments, present in only a single instance across multiple entries, were discarded to

146

focus on more representative data.

147

For each compound, the CNLs were calculated by subtracting the fragment m/z values

148

from the precursor ion mass. These CNLs were then converted into bit vectors representing

149

masses from 0 to 1000 Da with a step size of 0.01 Da (± 5 mDa mass tolerance). In this

150

representation, a value of 1 indicated the presence of a CNL in the spectrum, while a value

151

of 0 indicated its absence. To further refine the dataset, CNLs that occurred in fewer than

152

100 spectra were removed, resulting in a final dataset of 2440 common CNLs, with mass

153

values ranging from 1.03 to 382.19 Da.

154

In addition to the CNL bit vectors, the monoisotopic mass and predicted retention index

155

were added as continuous features. To calculate monoisotopic mass, the mass of proton, 1.008

156

Da, was subtracted from the measured m/z value of the proton adduct. To predict retention

157

indices the previously reported by van Herwerden et al. model based on molecular fingerprints

158

and retention indices calculated on the cocamide scale was employed. 47 This combination of

159

features allowed us to incorporate key structural and chromatographic information into the

160

model while minimizing the number of variables. To interpret the importance of individual

161

CNLs, a search was conducted in the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard to identify relevant

162

substructures. The prominent substructures frequently identified in the search results were

163

used to inform model interpretation.

164

Pesticide mixture dataset

165

The prioritization models were further tested on experimentally acquired datasets of varying

166

levels of tea extract matrix spiked with 253 pesticide standards. The samples were analysed

167

by the previously reported RPLC-ESI-Q-TOF method. 48 The three standard mixtures of

168

pesticides from Neochema were diluted with filtered water/ethanol solution (50%:50%, v/v,

169

Blank) or filtered tea extract that was further diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with Blank to final analyte

170

concentrations of 100 µg/L. Each sample was analysed twice. A detailed description of the

171

samples, acquisition method, and data processing is provided in Supporting Information,

172

section S1.

173

To obtain features and fragmentation information of detected pesticides, suspect screen-

174

ing was performed by applying the Universal Library Search Algorithm (ULSA). 49 A suspect

175

list of the pesticides was compiled from the MS2 spectra found in the MassBank EU, MoNA,

176

and NIST20 databases with a resolution higher than 5000 for each of these chemicals. To

177

minimize detection of false positive fragments a mass tolerance of 0.010 Da and a minimum

178

MS1 intensity of 2000 were applied for matching acquired fragments with suspects. Addi-

179

tionally, to increase the confidence of correctly detected fragments, a retention time tolerance

180

of 0.5 min was employed for comparison of MS1 and fragments profiles.

181

To convert retention times in retention indices based on the cocamide series a linear

182

regression model was built between retention time of 18 detected pesticides in all six chro-

183

matograms and their predicted retention indices (Figure S1. The model was applied to the

184

rest of the detected pesticides (Equation S1). Finally, the developed models were applied

185

to the detected suspects to assign toxicity categories. Since 96h LC50 mortality of fathead

186

minnows were unknown for detected pesticides, the predicted toxicity categories based on the

187

structure presented via molecular fingerprints were used as benchmark toxicity categories.

188

Modeling

189

Assigning toxicity categories

190

A previous study demonstrated the advantage of using clustering algorithms as an alterna-

191

tive to expert-based toxicity categorization, which typically relies on fixed LC50 or EC50

192

thresholds. 45 These expert-defined thresholds often fail to account for the uncertainty in

193

LC50 measurements or the structural similarities between chemicals. The k-means clus-

194

tering algorithm, an unsupervised iterative method, clusters data based on the distances

195

between measurements and a set of user-defined centroids. This approach takes advantage

196

of structural similarities between chemicals when forming clusters.

197

In this study, we applied k-means clustering to categorize chemicals from a fish toxicity

198

dataset, using scaled LC50 values [LOG(mg/L)], monoisotopic mass, and six elemental mass

199

defects (EMDs): CO, CCl, CN, CS, CF, and CH as input features. 50 Since LC50 values

200

primarily determine toxicity while structural information captures relationships between

201

chemical structures, we assigned a weight of 1/7 to each of the monoisotopic mass and the

202

six EMDs. This ensured that LC50 values and structural information contributed equally.

203

The algorithm converged after 12 iterations with an inertia of 323, forming three distinct

204

clusters (Figure S2). These clusters were then labeled as low, moderate, and high toxicity,

205

based on their positions along the y-axis (LC50 values). The final clustering allowed clear

206

differentiation between low toxicity (n=238), high toxicity (n=202), and moderate toxicity

207

(n=467) chemicals, providing a robust categorization informed by both toxicity data and

208

structural characteristics.

209

Classification models

210

For modeling, a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) algorithm was implemented in Julia with

211

scikit-learn. 51 Random Forest is a supervised algorithm that constructs several unique deci-

212

sion trees from bootstrap data. After model development, the major voting of predictions

213

resulting from the individual trees is used to produce the final RFC model prediction. 52

214

Fingerprint-based model: To train the fingerprint-based (FPs-based) model, the fish tox-

215

icity dataset (n = 1047) was split into a training set (n = 854), test set (n = 95), and global

216

test set (n = 98) via stratified sampling (Figure S2). The input for the classification model

217

was the optimizied fingerprint 53 and the output was toxicity categories. The molecular fin-

218

gerprints were calculated based on six different non-hashed molecular fingerprints, namely,

219

Atom Pair 2D Count (AP2DC), 54 Electrotopological state (E-state), 55 Klekotha-Roth Count

220

(KRC), 56 Molecular Access Systems (MACCS), 57 PubChem, 58 and Substructure Keys Count

221

(SSC) FPs. 59 340 bits out of combined 7073 were selected based on relevance to acute fish

222

toxicity prediction. 53 The model was optimized on a training set, validated with a test set

223

and finally tested with a global test set. Hyperparameter optimisation for the toxicity ran-

224

dom forest classification models consisted of a number of estimators varying between 100

225

and 400 with a step of 100, minimum samples leaf between 2 and 10 with a step of 2, a

226

maximum number of features of sqrt, log2, a maximum depth between 10 and 20 with a

227

step of 2. Cross-validation of the hyperparameter optimisation was 3-fold. This FPs-based

228

model then was utilized to predict the toxicity categories for CompTox and CNLs datasets.

229

CNLs-based model: To train the CNLs-based model the CNLs dataset was randomly

230

split into a training set (n = 18835), test set (n = 2093), and global test set (n = 98). The

231

input for the classification model was the CNL values converted to a bit vector, monoisotopic

232

mass, and predicted retention indices. The output of the CNL-based model was predicted

233

probability of assignment to toxicity categories. The probability was further converted into

234

predicted category based on the defined threshold. The threshold was calculated based on the

235

difference in probabilities between all three categories using test set only. Hyperparameter

236

optimisation was performed in the same manner as described in section ”Fingerprint-based

237

model”. Furthermore, to account for a class imbalance the weighted version of RFC was

238

employed.

239

KDE based model

240

The KDE algorithm 60 was used for toxicity categories mapping on chromatographic dimen-

241

sions using monoisotopic mass, predicted retention indices, and toxicity categories. Given

242

fitted KDE, we calculated the probability for each chemical to belong to one of the prede-

243

termined toxicity categories using the formula;

fˆ(x; H) =

n

244

where fˆ(x) represents the estimated density at point x, n is the number of data points,

245

d is the number of dimensions, H is the d × d bandwidth matrix, K is the multivariate

246

kernel function, |H| is the determinant of the bandwidth matrix H, and H−1/2 is the matrix

247

square root of the inverse of H. Because the classification data is unbalanced, the number

248

of samples in each class was used as weights. This effectively cancels out the 1/n in the

249

formula and allows for comparison between the kernel densities.

250

Bandwidth selection was carried out using Silverman’s rule of thumb;

sigmaj =

4σ̂j5
3nk

 15
(2)

251

where σj denotes the standard deviation of the j-th feature in class Ck . This method

252

ensures a smooth estimation of the density function, aiding in the effective prediction of

253

toxicity classifications.

254

To evaluate the performance of the KDE based model, densities for all three toxicity

255

classes were calculated for the fish toxicity dataset as only available experimentally mea-

256

sured values. The toxicity category was assigned based on the highest calculated probability

257

(density).

258

Applicability domain calculations

259

The Applicability Domain (AD) defines the parameter space within which a predictive model

260

is expected to make reliable predictions. In this study, we utilized the leverage approach to

261

define and evaluate the AD of our predictive model. 61 The AD was assessed by calculating

262

the leverage for each sample using the equation;

⊤
−1
hi = x⊤
i (X X) xi

(3)

263

where xi is the vector of predictor variables for the i-th sample, and X is the matrix of

264

predictor variables for all training samples. The leverage values indicate the influence of

265

each sample on the model’s predictions.

266

The warning leverage threshold h∗ is determined to identify samples that have high

267

leverage and may lead to unreliable predictions. The threshold is typically set to three times

268

the average leverage in the training set;

h∗ = 3 × havg

(4)

269

Thus, predictions for samples with leverage values greater than these thresholds are consid-

270

ered less reliable and are flagged as outside the AD. To ensure these do not affect the kernel

271

density estimation, the weights for each sample were set at 1/h.

272

Performance assessment

273

For the evaluation of the performance of the multiclass classification model, several metrics

274

were computed, including precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The classification metrics

275

provide an overview of the model’s performance for each class. The calculations for these

276

metrics are as follows:

277

278

Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted
positives.

To further validate the classification models, the confusion matrix was computed, which

284

provided a detailed breakdown of the model’s predictions compared to the actual class labels.

285

Because of the class imbalance, the confusion matrix was normalized to represent fractions,

286

making it easier to interpret the proportion of correct and incorrect predictions for each

Results and Discussion

298

In this study we developed two classification algorithms, machine learning and probabilistic,

299

to predict fish toxicity categories based only on the chromatographic and fragmentation

300

without identified structural information. Additionally, to assign the toxicity categories we

301

trained the classification model based on the molecular FPs. For the probabilistic algorithm,

302

the CompTox database was mapped on RPLC-HRMS space and KDE was fitted to each

303

toxicity category assigned based on the known chemical structures (FPs). For the machine

304

learning algorithm, the RFC model was trained on precursor ion mass (proton adduct),

305

retention indices, and fragmentation information in the form of CNLs bit vector.

306

FPs-based model

307

The fingerprint-based model developed in this study was an RFC model trained on 900

308

structures described with optimized molecular fingerprint 53 and their experimental LC50

309

[LOG(mg/L)] values. 43–45 Optimized hyperparameters of the model were determined as 300

310

estimators, a minimum of 10 samples split, a maximum depth of 20, and sqrt as the number

311

of features for split. To assess the performance of the model confusion matrix, accuracy,

312

precision, recall, and f1-score for each toxicity category were calculated (Table 1).

313

The accuracy of the optimized model was 0.86 for the training set, 0.75 for the test set

314

and 0.70 as a mean accuracy of 3-fold cross-validation, which was comparable to previously

315

reported QSAR models for toxicity predictions. 62,63 Performance assessment of the prediction

316

results for chemicals from the test set showed that the model consistently performed well

317

for low and moderate toxicity categories with an F1-Score 0.80 and 0.73 correspondingly.

318

However, the F1-Score for the high toxicity category was lower compared to the other two

319

categories, 0.54. Based on the confusion matrix and leverage analysis (Figure S4), the lower

320

recall for the high-toxicity class in the test set was primarily due to the misclassification of

321

compounds with relatively low leverage values into the moderate-toxicity class. Compounds

322

with lower leverage generally have lower monoisotopic mass and show greater similarity to

323

compounds in the moderate and low-toxicity categories, that influences the accuracy of high-

324

toxicity category predictions. Moreover, the chemicals assigned to the high-toxicity category

325

exhibited greater variability in the structural representation with the smallest number of

326

chemicals included, 145 for the training set and 13 for the test set.

327

To ensure a broader applicability domain for predictive purposes, the final fingerprint-

328

based classification model was trained using a combination of the training and test sets.

329

A separate global test set, containing measured toxicity values and available LC-HRMS

data, was reserved for the final model assessment. The validated model was then used to

331

predict toxicity categories for the CompTox and CNLs datasets, expanding the dataset and

332

supporting the development of a probabilistic approach and the training of a CNLs-based

model.

KDE-based model

335

To create a KDE algorithm the toxicity categories and retention indices were predicted for

336

each chemical from the CompTox dataset based on their structures. This information was

337

then used to map toxicity regions within the RPLC-MS domain, linking toxicity categories

338

to features in the chromatogram.

339

Out of the 764,590 chemicals of the filtered Comptox database, 83,969 chemicals (10.9%)

340

were classified as low toxicity, 458,302 chemicals (59.9%) as moderate toxicity, and 222,319

341

chemicals (29.0%) as high toxicity class. However, only 20.8% of the CompTox dataset is

342

well represented by the training set, meaning the calculated leverage for these chemicals is

343

less than the leverage threshold, 3 times of the mean value of leverage in the training set,

344

1.02. To decrease the uncertainty of KDE we used calculated leverage values as weights to

345

account for the less certain prediction of the fingerprint-based model. Therefore, chemicals

346

that were well represented in the training set, gave more weights for the density estimation

347

and more accurately represented the results. The weights used were 1/h with h being the

348

leverage of a compound (Figure 2a).

349

The CompTox dataset contains a wide variety of structures, with the range of monoiso-

350

topic mass between 12.0 and 5,628.0 Da, and the predicted retention indices from 178.6 to

351

1,530.5 RI value. (Figure S3) A partion of this space cannot be analysed with RPLC, either

352

due to insufficient retention (e.g., highly hydrophilic chemicals, often with low masses, i.e.,

353

< 70 Da) or excessive retention (e.g., highly hydrophobic chemicals with high mass and high

354

retention indices). Several recent studies investigated algorithms for assigning chemicals to

355

be analyzable with RPLC or other types of chromatography. 46,64–66 We applied the machine

356

learning algorithm developed by van Herwerden et al. to the CompTox dataset to filter out

357

chemicals that will not be analysed and therefore detected using RPLC. Of the 671,395

358

chemicals predicted to fall within the RPLC space, 78,087 (11.6%) were classified as low tox-

359

icity, 431,089 (64.2%) as moderate toxicity, and 162,219 (24.2%) as high toxicity category.

360

Thus, mainly compounds predicted as highly toxic fell outside of RPLC space (Figure 2b).

361

Overall accuracy of the algorithm was 0.69. Similar results were observed for overall

362

precision, recall and f1-score. The metrics of predictions for moderate and high toxicity cat-

363

egories showed comparable performance with precision 0.75-0.76, recall 0.6-0.64, and f1-score

364

0.67-0.70. Results for low-toxicity group with 0.58 for precision and 0.84 for recall, differed

365

from the results for the rest of the categories. Overall, the algorithm showed consistently

366

good performance among all categories.

367

Only 1.3% of chemicals from low-toxicity group were classified as highly toxic chemicals

368

and 9.4% of high-toxicity chemicals were classified as low-toxicity chemicals. This indi-

369

cated that low toxicity compounds generally do not occupy the region of high toxicity class

370

compounds. The larger error occurs in misclassification between moderate and low toxicity

371

groups (28%) and between high and moderate toxicity groups (30%) (Figure S5). The de-

veloped algorithm based on KDE was as accurate as the FPs-based model, even though no

373

actual structural information was provided to it.

374

CNLs-based model

375

For CNLs-based model construction, we predicted toxicity categories and retention indices

376

for the CNLs dataset. Out of 20,928 chemicals in the dataset 3,152 chemicals were predicted

377

as low-toxicity chemicals, 12,662 as moderate, and 5,114 as high toxicity. The number of

378

chemicals assigned to different groups shows an imbalance in the dataset; therefore to train

379

the model, the weighted version of RFC was employed.

380

The optimized the CNLs-based model showed an overall accuracy of 0.76 for training set

381

and 0.72 for test set. Therefore, the final model showed a high level of accuracy, comparable

382

to fingerprint-based classification model. Moreover, precision, recall, and F1-score for train-

383

ing and test set show consistent result for all three toxicity groups (Table S2), indicating

384

excellent performance of the model regardless of the class imbalance.

385

This model consisted of 600 trees, a minimum of two samples in each leaf, a maximum

386

depth of 20, and ”sqrt” as a maximum number of features. A difference in probability

387

threshold of 0.08 was applied to the classification results: if the difference in predicted

388

probabilities across all three toxicity categories was less than 0.08 (or 8%), the chemical

389

was assigned to the moderate toxicity category. This is because, in the KDE model, the

390

moderate toxicity category is the most uncertain and tends to overlap with both the low and

391

high toxicity categories.

392

The model explained 85% of the variance using 592 variables, including CNLs with masses

393

ranging from 2.01 Da to 354.19 Da. Based on impurity decrease across trees, the largest

394

contributions to the model came from retention index (RI) and accurate mass, cumulatively

395

accounting for 36%. These were followed by contributions from CNLs with masses such

396

as 17.03 Da (1.7%), likely corresponding to NH3 , 45.01 Da (CH3 NO), 27.01 Da (HCN),

397

and 63.03 Da (HNO2 or CH2 SO), each contributing around 1%. While these structures

398

are plausible, alternative small molecules corresponding to these masses cannot be disre-

399

garded. Higher mass CNLs had an additional contribution, including 294.11 Da, potentially

400

representing multiple aromatic rings and/or benzyloxy substructures, 216.13 Da, possibly

401

linked to aromatic heterocycles like indole or quinoline, and 174.11 Da, which may cor-

402

respond to a thiocarboxylic ester. This indicates that the model primarily relies on MS1

403

data, supplemented by structural information that linked to the potentially toxicity-relevant

404

substructures.

405

Comparison of the KDE and CNLs-based models

406

Based on the confusion matrices for training and test set the comparable performance to KDE

407

algorithm was observed. The main misclassifications occur for a moderate toxicity group,

408

while low toxicity barely ever classified as high toxicity group (1%) and vice versa (0%)

409

(Figure S6). However, the test and training set for the KDE model and CNLs based model

410

were different therefore one-to-one comparison cannot be performed using these datasets.

411

Thus, to further evaluate and compare prediction power between all three generated models
19

412

we used a global test set. These 98 entries had both the CNL bit vector and fish toxicity

413

experimentally determined values and were completely unknown to any of the models.

414

When comparing KDE and CNLs-based models with the FPs-model, the confusion ma-

415

trices indicate that the FPs-based model produced comparable results in predicting low and

416

high toxicity categories. This is a significant outcome, given that the KDE and CNLs-based

417

models do not account for the structural representation of the compounds and are directly

418

linked to chromatographic and mass spectrometry data. However, FPs-based model outper-

419

formed the other models in predicting the moderate toxicity group, achieving an accuracy

420

of 0.88 compared to 0.47 for the KDE model and 0.43 for the CNL model (Figure S6). This

421

can be explained by the substantial overlap in the RPLC-MS space assigned to the moderate

422

toxicity category, which has a mass range of 110.11 to 336.30 and retention indices between

423

285.28 and 1139.23, with the regions for low and high toxicity categories.

424

To further demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach, we applied it to an

425

experimentally acquired dataset of a standard pesticide mixture at varying concentrations

426

in a tea extract. Between 141 and 155 pesticides were detected out of 253 in the standard

427

mixture across all three levels of the tea matrix (no tea, 100-fold dilution, and 10-fold di-

428

lution). The minimum number of 141 pesticides was detected in the 100-fold diluted tea,

429

while 155 were detected in the 10-fold diluted tea. No clear trend was observed between the

430

number of detected pesticides and the matrix dilution. Additionally, the number of detected

431

and matched fragments was compared across the three matrices. The median number of

432

fragments per pesticide was 12 to 13, with the 25th and 75th percentiles ranging from 7 to

433

21-23. Overall, no significant influence of the matrix level was observed on the number of

434

detected pesticides or the number of corresponding fragments. Since matrix effects and other

435

parameters can influence not only the number but also the quality of detected fragments,

436

the CNLs-based model was applied independently to each chromatogram (Table S3, Figure

437

S7).

438

To keep prediction results comparable between the models based on KDE and CNLs,

20

439

we retained only the features corresponding to the standard pesticide mixture detected in

440

all samples. As part of the ULSA workflow, Suspect Screening was applied to identify

441

corresponding features at both the chromatographic and fragmentation levels. In total 84

442

pesticides were detected in all three different matrices, 18 of which were used to establish

443

a correlation between retention time and retention indices, yielding an R2 = 0.91. The

444

remaining 66 pesticides were used for further testing. Based on molecular structure, the FPs-

445

based model classified the 66 pesticides as follows: 3 assigned to the low toxicity category,

446

48 to moderate toxicity, and 15 to high toxicity.

447

When applied to the detected pesticides, the CNLs-based model achieved an average

448

accuracy of 0.76-0.80, while the KDE model had a lower accuracy of 0.61. Additionally, the

449

accuracy of the CNLs model was not significantly influenced by different matrix levels, as

450

variations in accuracy across repeated measurements were within 3%, similar to the vari-

451

ation between different matrices. This suggests that the CNLs model maintains stability

452

and reliability across diverse experimental conditions, making it particularly useful for com-

453

plex environmental matrices. We examined chemicals that were misclassified by either the

454

KDE-based or CNLs-based models, meaning they were assigned to a different toxicity cat-

455

egory compared to the benchmark (FPs-based) model. For instance, Metsulfuron-methyl

456

(INCHIKEY: RSMUVYRMZCOLBH-UHFFFAOYSA-N) was predicted to belong to the

457

high toxicity category by the KDE-based model, while both the CNLs-based and FPs-based

458

models classified it as moderate toxicity. While there are no measured LC50 values avail-

459

able for fathead minnows, experimental LC50 values for Bluegill Sunfish and Rainbow Trout

460

reported in the Pesticide Ecotoxicity Database from the EPA indicate LC50 values greater

461

than 2 [LOG(mg/L)] for a 96-hour exposure. Based on classification criteria, chemicals with

462

LC50 values above 2 [LOG(mg/L)] and a monoisotopic mass of 381.07 Da typically fall into

463

the moderate or low toxicity categories for fathead minnows. The CNLs and FPs models,

464

therefore, offered a more accurate classification in this case, reflecting the expected behavior

465

of Metsulfuron-methyl in aquatic species. On the other hand, Thiabendazole (INCHIKEY:

21

466

WJCNZQLZVWNLKY-UHFFFAOYSA-N) was assigned to the moderate toxicity category

467

by the CNLs-based model, while the KDE- and FPs-based models classified it as low toxicity.

468

Again, no data were available for fathead minnows, but the LC50 values for Bluegill Sunfish

469

and Rainbow Trout, as recorded by the EPA, range between -0.25 and 1.8 [LOG(mg/L)].

470

With an accurate mass of 201.04 Da, this chemical is typically assigned to either moderate

471

or low toxicity categories. The discrepancy in classification highlights the challenges of clas-

472

sifying compounds that fall near the boundary between toxicity classes. In this case, the

473

CNLs model’s assignment of moderate toxicity may be more reflective of the compound’s

474

potential toxicity, given the reported LC50 values and structural characteristics.

475

Both models performed well on experimental and global test datasets. Overall, the CNLs-

476

based model outperformed the KDE-based model in the pesticide dataset, demonstrating

477

superior predictive power and more consistent classification.

479

spectrometry (MS2) data to EC50 and LC50 values. These studies primarily aim to pre-

480

dict LC50 or EC50 values, which are then converted into toxicity categories. 30–33 Typically,

481

this process involves converting the spectra into estimated molecular formulas and predicted

482

probabilistic molecular fingerprints using tools like SIRIUS. The generated probabilistic fin-

483

gerprints are then used for LC50 or EC50 prediction. As a result, the performance of these

484

models depends on the accuracy of the molecular formula and fingerprint predictions. In

485

contrast, our approach bypasses the need for molecular structure prediction by directly link-

486

ing mass spectral signals to toxicity categories. Instead of using a regression model to predict

487

continuous EC50 or LC50 values, we apply a classification algorithm that assigns compounds

488

directly into toxicity categories. By relying solely on chromatographic and fragmentation

489

data, our CNL- and KDE-based algorithms present a unique approach that differs from the

490

structure-dependent models used in previous studies, making direct comparisons challenging.

491

Implications

492

In this study, we showed a novel feature prioritization approach based on predicting toxicity

493

categories, by employing two algorithms: a probabilistic KDE-based model and a machine

494

learning-based CNLs model. Due to the complex nature of environmental samples and the

495

highly convoluted data, fragmentation information is not consistently available for all fea-

496

tures. To mitigate the influence of the MS2 signal availability we developed KDE-based

497

algorithm, which relies solely on MS1 and retention of the features. On the other hand the

498

combination of retention and MS1 and fragmentation patterns or CNLs enhances the predic-

499

tion accuracy. Our approach connects chromatographic and fragmentation data directly to

500

toxicity categories, bypassing the need for compound identification, a common requirement

501

in the currently available prioritization strategies. Moreover, our models demonstrated accu-

502

racy comparable to those that depend on structural information (FPs-based model), enabling

503

effective toxicity predictions even for compounds with unknown structures. This makes our

504

models not only valuable for potential prioritization of unknown features in current NTA

505

studies but also suitable for enhancing retrospective analyses of historical datasets.

506

One of the current limitations of the developed approach is the limited number of mea-

507

sured toxicity values, retention indices, and high-resolution mass spectra, which reduces the

508

model’s applicability domain. Furthermore, the model is currently developed based on data

509

from a single trophic level and acute toxicity. More specific mode of action models can

510

give more insight into hazard scores and risk assessment. Another challenge arises from the

511

fact that the model was trained on clean spectra obtained from publicly available spectral

512

databases. In real LC-HRMS measurements, co-eluted compounds, instrumental artifacts,

513

and background noise can introduce false positive fragments, potentially reducing prediction

514

accuracy. As a result, robust and reliable data preprocessing is critical especially for DIA

515

experiments to ensure the accuracy of the model.
