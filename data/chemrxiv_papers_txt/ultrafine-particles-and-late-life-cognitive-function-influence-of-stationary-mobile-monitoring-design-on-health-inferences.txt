Abstract
Growing evidence links ultrafine particles (UFP) to neurotoxicity, but human studies remain
limited. Various mobile monitoring approaches have been used to collect repeated short-term
air pollution samples and develop human exposure models. However, whether design choices
impact epidemiologic inferences, including for UFP and cognitive function, remains unclear.
We evaluated the adjusted association between UFP number concentration (PNC) and late-life
cognitive function (Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument – Item Response Theory [CASI-IRT])
in the Adult Changes in Thought cohort (N=5,283) by leveraging an extensive roadside mobile
monitoring campaign specifically designed for epidemiologic application. To assess the impact
of common, reduced monitoring approaches on this association, we repeatedly subsampled
UFP measures from the extensive campaign, developed exposure models, and evaluated the
degree to which associations were impacted.
In a reduced adjustment model, the mean baseline CASI-IRT score decreased by 0.020 (95% CI: 0.036, -0.004) per 1,900 pt/cm³ increase in PNC. Associations were consistent across most
sampling designs, including fewer visits (median point estimate -0.019, IQR: -0.022, -0.016),
fewer seasons (-0.019, IQR: -0.021, -0.016), and unbalanced sampling (-0.018, IQR: -0.022, 0.016), with very unbalanced designs yielding more variable estimates. In the primary
adjustment model, the CASI-IRT score increased by 0.002 (95% CI: -0.016, 0.020), with similar
estimates across fewer visits (0.002, IQR: -0.001, 0.004), fewer seasons (0.000, IQR: -0.001,
0.003), and unbalanced sampling (0.001, IQR: -0.001, 0.004). Rush hour designs were more
similar (0.002, IQR: 0.000, 0.003) than business hour designs (0.006, IQR: 0.005, 0.007), but the
opposite was true when temporal adjustments were applied (rush: -0.003, IQR: -0.005, -0.001;
business: 0.002, IQR: 0.001, 0.004). We observed similar trends in sensitivity and secondary
analyses.
We found no link between UFP exposures and late-life cognition. While various monitoring
approaches may be used to capture epidemiologic inferences, extending beyond weekday
business and rush hours is likely important.

1 Introduction
A growing body of evidence links ultrafine particles (UFPs), typically defined as particles ≤
100 nm in diameter, and other traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) to adverse health effects
(Brugge & Fuller, 2020; Flood-Garibay et al., 2023; HEI, 2013; US EPA, 2019). While research on
UFPs is still emerging, these have been associated with increased levels of inflammation,
oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, and neurodegeneration (HEI, 2013). Only a few studies have
explored the link between UFP exposures and late-life cognitive function in humans, and these
have produced mixed results. For example, investigators linked elevated residential UFP levels
to an increased incidence of malignant brain tumors (Weichenthal et al., 2020). However, other
studies, including one on late-life dementia incidence in the Seattle-based Adult Changes in
Thought (ACT) study (Blanco et al., 2024) and another on cognitive decline in older adults
recruited from Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRC) throughout the US (Gan et al.,
2023), have reported no associations with UFP exposures. Despite the growing interest, UFPs
are not routinely monitored by traditional long-term fixed-site networks like other pollutants,
such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2), making it challenging to
characterize population-level exposures needed for epidemiologic studies.
Mobile monitoring campaigns, which use a mobile platform such as a vehicle to collect
repeated short-term air samples from various locations, are commonly implemented to address
this gap and capture the high spatial variability of UFPs (Kim et al., 2023). Over the past few
decades, these campaigns have provided valuable insights into pollutant sources,
spatiotemporal variability, pollution “hotspots,” commuter exposures, and more (Apte et al.,
2017; Austin et al., 2021; Karumanchi et al., 2021; Knibbs et al., 2011; Weichenthal et al., 2016).
However, monitoring designs vary substantially, and there are no standard protocols. Most
campaigns collect only a handful of measurements (visits) per site (median: ~4, range: ~1-40),
last between a few weeks and approximately 3 months, and sample exclusively during weekday
business or rush hours (Kim et al., 2023). Nearly all collect samples in an unbalanced fashion,
with some locations receiving more visits than others due to various logistical constraints. Most
campaigns produce poor to moderately performing exposure assessment models.
While an increasing number of campaigns aim to develop exposure models for
epidemiologic applications, limited attention has been given to the role of monitoring design in
this context, despite its potential to bias long-term exposure assessments (Blanco, Doubleday,
et al., 2022; Blanco et al., 2023; Blanco, Gassett, et al., 2022; Sheppard & Blanco, Under
Review). This setting is unique from other applications since the goal is often to estimate
longer-term, around-the-clock exposures for residential locations rather than shorter-term,
weekday, on-road exposures.
The objective of this study was to investigate the association between UFPs and late-life
cognitive function and to evaluate how emerging stationary (temporary roadside stop)
monitoring designs impact exposure assessment models and subsequent health inferences. We
leveraged data from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) cohort, a large prospective study on
the aging brain (Kukull et al., 2002), and an extensive mobile monitoring campaign conducted in
the greater Seattle area specifically designed for epidemiologic applications (Blanco, Gassett, et
al., 2022). We conducted a subsampling study to evaluate the impact of common monitoring

2 Methods
Figure 1 summarizes the analytic method further detailed in this section. We use extensive
roadside mobile monitoring measures to develop reference all-data air pollution exposure
prediction models, use these to evaluate baseline ACT participant exposures, and evaluate the
association between cognitive function and UFPs. To investigate the role of mobile monitoring
design, we subsampled the air pollution data following common field sampling approaches and
used the resulting data to develop comparable exposure and health inference models. We
compared these results to those from the all-data exposure model.

2.1 The ACT Cohort and Outcome Ascertainment
We evaluated cognitive function in ACT, a community-based, prospective cohort study in
the greater Seattle area that has been investigating the aging brain since 1994 (Kukull et al.,
2002). The study randomly invites elderly (65+ yr) members of the Kaiser Permanente
Washington integrated healthcare delivery system (formerly Group Health Cooperative) to
participate. Invitees are assessed for cognitive function at baseline using the Cognitive Abilities
Screening Instrument (CASI), which combines common screening tests including the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) and the Hasegawa Dementia Rating Scale to quantitatively
assess attention, concentration, orientation, short- and long-term memory, language abilities,
judgement, and other functions (Teng et al., 2004). People with high cognitive scores (scores of

≥ 86/100) are enrolled. People with low scores are evaluated with a comprehensive

neuropsychological battery and focused neurological examination. Results of those
assessments and medical records including imaging are reviewed at a consensus conference to
identify cases of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease using standardized research criteria. People
who do not have dementia from this consensus process are also invited to enroll in the study.
The final cognition scores from the CASI are derived using Item Response Theory (CASI-IRT), to
improve score accuracy, measure cognitive change with less bias, and to account for missing
test items (Crane et al., 2008; Ehlenbach et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017). Participants are
prospectively followed until dementia incidence, drop-out, or death. Extensive health, lifestyle,
biological, and demographic data are also collected.
As of March of 2020, the total ACT enrollment consisted of 5,763 participants. Our primary
analysis was restricted 5,283 (92%) participants with a valid baseline CASI-IRT score, those who
had lived in the exposure monitoring region (see below) at least 95% during the prior five years,
and those with adjustment covariates (SI Figure S1 details participant retention). The analytic
cohort had excellent residential histories and air pollution coverage (Blanco, Gassett, et al.,
2022; Shaffer et al., 2021). On average, participants lived in the monitoring area >99% of the
time, had exact geocoded residential addresses 98% of the time (e.g., vs. street level
geocoding), and had imputed addresses only 5% of the time (i.e., from residential gaps).
Study procedures were approved by the University of Washington and Kaiser Permanente
institutional review boards. ACT participants signed informed consent forms.

2.2 Air Pollution Exposure Assessment
We evaluated TRAP exposures for the ACT cohort using air pollution models from an
extensive mobile monitoring campaign that was specifically designed for epidemiologic
application (Blanco, Gassett, et al., 2022). In summary, the campaign monitored TRAP within a
1,200 land km2 area in the greater Seattle area and consisted of repeated two-minute
measurements at 309 roadside locations representative of ACT residential locations.
Approximately 29 (IQR: 29-29, range: 26-35) measurements were collected from each location
over the course of a year between March 2019 and March 2020 across all four seasons, all days
of the week, and most hours of the day (5 AM – 11 PM). Median pollutant concentrations were
estimated for each site visit, and these data were used to develop reference all-data site annual
averages, as described below. This study focuses primarily on total PNC measures from the TSI
NanoScan 3910, which measured 10-420 nm particles and is consistent with some air quality

recommendations to measure UFPs down to at least 10 nm (WHO, 2021). In sensitivity
analyses, we investigate at 10-100 nm PNC from the NanoScan since UFPs are commonly
defined as ≤ 100 nm and 20-1,000 nm PNC from the P-TRAK, a common UFP monitoring
instrument. In secondary analyses, we evaluated nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (Aerodyne Research
Inc. CAPS NO2).
As previously described (Blanco et al., 2023), we developed universal kriging – partial least
squares (UK-PLS) models to predict PNC from hundreds of geographic covariates (e.g., land use,
roadway proximity, population density). We evaluated the cross-validated model predictions
against the all-data annual average estimates and summarized these with mean-square error
$
$
(MSE) -based R2 (𝑅!"#
) in primary analyses and more traditional regression-based R2 (𝑅%&'
) in
2
secondary analyses. R MSE evaluates the degree to which prediction-observation pairs are
identical (i.e., along the one-to-one line) and is thus well suited to evaluate predictive
$
performance, whereas 𝑅%&'
evaluates linear associations. This UK-PLS model was slightly
modified from previously developed models (Blanco et al., 2024; Blanco, Gassett, et al., 2022)
to allow for comparisons across monitoring designs (described below), as detailed in Note S2.
We used this model to predict time-weighted average PNC exposures for each participant at
baseline based on their prior five-year residential history. Details on the use of residential
histories to evaluate exposures can be found in earlier work (Blanco et al., 2024; Shaffer et al.,
2021). We assumed that UFP exposure surfaces had been stable over time since historical UFP
data to develop longer-term exposures were limited. Our prior work shows that this
assumption may be valid since the spatial variability of UFPs is much greater than the long-term
temporal trend (2009+) and thus, capturing the spatial variability, as was done in the Seattle
mobile monitoring campaign, is most critical (See Figure S8 in Blanco et al. [2024]). In sensitivity
analyses, we restricted analyses to participants enrolled starting in 2010 to reduce to soften
this assumption.

2.3 Restricted Air Pollution Mobile Monitoring Designs
To investigate the role of air pollution mobile monitoring design on health inferences, we
subsampled the mobile monitoring data (309 roadside locations x ~29 visits each) with
replacement following common, more restricted sampling designs, as described in

Samples were distributed evenly across the randomly selected seasons (e.g., 12 site visits/3
seasons = 4 site visits/season).
In the first design, we sampled each site a fewer number of times (n=4, 6, 12 visits) with
no additional temporal restrictions, and conducted 30 “campaign” repetitions of each.
In the second design, we restricted sampling to fewer (1-3) seasons and collected 12 visits
from each site, ensuring that samples were evenly distributed across sampling seasons.
In the third design, we sampled fewer visits per site (n=12) during weekday business (9
AM - 5 PM) or rush (7-10 AM and 3-6 PM) hours. The fewer visit design with 12 visits per site
was a reference for these designs since it collected the same number of visits per site without
temporal restrictions.
We used business and rush hour visit samples as is (unadjusted) or temporally-adjusted, a
common approach for addressing known biases resulting from restricted sampling campaigns
that do not sample during the full exposure period of interest (e.g., weekends, night time)
(Eeftens et al., 2012; Klompmaker et al., 2015; Montagne et al., 2015; van de Beek et al., 2021;
van Nunen et al., 2017). This approach generally entails using continuous air monitoring from a
“background” or low-concentration location; calculating time-specific adjustment factors,
based commonly on the difference between a time-specific (e.g., hourly) measurement and the
site’s long-term average; and applying these differences to the measured concentrations.
Details of our approach are in Note S1. In summary, we: 1) simulated a long-term UFP
monitoring site at an urban background site from collocated PNC and NO2 measures along with
temporal indicators since continuous UFP measures were otherwise unavailable for the entire

mobile monitoring study period; 2) generated adjustment factors, defined as the difference
between the predicted hourly PNC and the long-term average PNC at that background site; and
3) applied these adjustment factors to the mobile monitoring data collected under business and
rush hours designs.
In our fourth design, we simulated a practice employed by nearly all field campaigns
where location samples are spatially unbalanced such that locations have different visit
frequencies. Specifically, we sampled based on site variability, which was determined by
regressing site-specific PNC interquartile ranges (IQR; median [range]: 7,183 [2,834-22,625]
pt/cm3 based on ~29 visits per site) against the first two PLS components, which summarized
hundreds of geographic covariate predictors (see below for example covariates). The in-sample
model R2 was 0.46. We used this model to predict in-sample site-specific IQR and ordered these
such that 129 (42%) sites were treated as medium variability sites where visits continued to be
fixed to 12. The remaining sites were split into high (H) or low (L) variability (n=90 [29%] each).
Figure S5 shows the distribution of IQRs used. We visited high-variability sites more times (14 to
22 visits) and low-variability sites fewer times (10 to 2 visits), and vice versa.
As with our all-data exposure models, we calculated annual average PNC site
concentrations with the resulting data from each sampling campaign, developed exposure
prediction models, and used these to assess participant exposures. In total, there were 480
exposure models for primary analyses using 10-420 nm PNC from the NanoScan. We compared
each model’s cross-validated site predictions against the all-data annual averages (our best
estimates). We and others have shown the importance of validating model predictions against
unbiased estimates since biased, unstable campaign measurements (e.g., from restricted
sampling designs) can produce noisy and misleading conclusions (Blanco, Doubleday, et al.,
2022; Blanco et al., 2023; Kerckhoffs et al., 2016; Messier et al., 2018).
We repeated this process for sensitivity and secondary analyses of other pollutants.

2.4 Inferential Analyses
We evaluated the association between cognitive function (CASI-IRT) and air pollution
using the model:
𝑌( = α + 𝛽) 𝑋((,) + ∑+ 𝛿),+ 𝑊(,+ + 𝜖( (1)
where 𝑌( is the baseline CASI-IRT for participant 𝑗; 𝛼 is the modeled intercept; 𝑋((,) is the
predicted five-year average air pollution exposure prior to baseline for participant 𝑗 from
exposure model 𝑚; 𝛽) is the linear association between air pollution and CASI-IRT and is the
main parameter of interest; and 𝑊(,+ and 𝛿),+ are indexed by adjustment variable 𝑖 with 𝛿),+
representing the respective estimated coefficient. In reduced models, adjustment variables
included participant age, calendar year (2 yr categories), sex, and education (no degree, high
school equivalent, bachelor’s, master’s, doctorate, other). Primary models further adjusted for
race (White, People of Color) and socioeconomic status (SES) based on the Neighborhood
Disadvantage Index (NDI) at a participant’s longest-lived address at or prior to baseline. NDI is a
validated indicator composed of census tract-level variables from the American Community

Survey (Miles et al., 2016). We contextualized these results by calculating age-equivalents for
the primary analysis with the all-data reference exposure model, defined as the air pollution to
age coefficient ratio. We used robust standard errors to improve the reliability of inference
even if the model was misspecified (Zeileis, 2004; Zeileis et al., 2020; Zeileis & Hothorn, 2002).
We used a p-value threshold of 0.05 to determine statistical significance.
All analyses were conducted in R (v. 4.2.2) (R Core Team, 2023).

3.2 Exposure Assessment and Model Performances
The median (IQR) site PNC (10-420 nm) from the all-data campaign was 9,747 (8,41211,199) pt/cm3. Figure S6 details this distribution, the concentration distributions of other PNC
measures from sensitivity analyses which produced lower concentrations, and the estimated
site concentrations from restricted mobile monitoring sampling campaigns.
$
The all-data PNC exposure model had a cross-validated 𝑅!"#,,&of 0.65 (Figure S7).
Reduced sampling designs produced incrementally worse predictions when campaigns had ≤12

$

frequencies across locations (𝑅!"# ≈ 80 − 90% of 𝑅!"#,,&- ), durations <1 year (𝑅!"#

$
$
90% of 𝑅!"#,,&- ), and restricted sampling hours (M-F business, rush; 𝑅!"# ≈ 60 −
$
90% of 𝑅!"#,,&). Performance was generally worsened when temporal adjustments were
applied to business and rush hour designs (see Figure S8 for R2 comparisons and Figure S9 for
site-specific prediction errors). Sensitivity and secondary analyses of 10-100 nm PNC, 20-1,000
$
nm PNC, and NO2 as well as 𝑅%&'
showed similar patterns (Figure S10-S11).
The median (IQR) predicted PNC participant exposure was 10,124 (9,293-11,100) pt/cm3
and ranged from 5,930-22,134 pt/cm3. Exposure predictions for sampling campaigns varied
across campaigns (Figure S12). The business hour design tended to underpredict high exposures
relative to the all-data exposure model, while the rush hour design overpredicted high
exposures. Designs with few visits to high variability sites (H2 L22) had highly variable
predictions across campaigns, particularly for high concentrations. Results showed similar
patterns in sensitivity analyses of 10-100 nm and 20-1,000 nm PNC. Predictions from the alldata exposure model were strongly correlated with those from most sampling campaigns
(median Pearson correlations [R] > 0.85), indicating similar exposure surface although the
business hour design consistently predicted exposures with lower correlations (R ~0.77-0.78;
Figure S13). All designs had atypical campaigns that had meaningfully lower correlations,
indicating variability across campaign iterations and lower exposure model performances.

3.3 Inferential Analyses
In the reduced health inference model, the mean baseline CASI-IRT score decreased by 0.020 (95% CI: -0.036, -0.004) per 1,900 pt/cm³ increment in PNC, equivalent to approximately
7.5 months of aging (Table S2). Health associations remained consistent across most reduced
sampling designs including those with fewer visits (median point estimate: -0.19, IQR: -0.022, 0.016), fewer seasons (median: -0.19, IQR: -0.021, -0.016), and unbalanced sampling (median: 0.18, IQR: -0.022, -0.016) (Figure 2). However, unbalanced designs produced more variable

estimates across campaigns. Estimates from business and rush hour sampling designs were
systematically attenuated compared to the reference. Median associations were -0.008 (IQR: 0.010, -0.006) for business hours and -0.012 (IQR: -0.014, -0.010) for rush hours. Temporally
adjusting rush hour sampling designs brought the estimates closer to the reference, resulting in
a median association of -0.015 (IQR: -0.017, -0.014), whereas adjustment did not meaningfully
improve the business hours estimates. Figures S14 provides additional details, including the
point estimates and 95% CIs of selected designs.
In the primary health inference model, the mean baseline CASI-IRT score increased by
0.002 (95% CI: -0.016, 0.020) per 1,900 pt/cm³ increment in PNC, equivalent to approximately 0.7 months of aging (Table S2). As before, health associations from designs with fewer visits
(median point estimate: 0.002, IQR: -0.001, 0.004), fewer seasons (median: 0.000, IQR: -0.001,
0.003), and unbalanced sampling (median: 0.001, IQR: -0.001, 0.004) produced similar
estimates (Figure 2). Rush hour designs also yielded comparable results (median: 0.002, IQR:
0.000, 0.003), whereas business hour designs produced more positive estimates (median:
0.006, IQR: 0.005, 0.007). Temporal adjustment reduced these estimates, bringing the business
hour estimates closer to the reference (median: 0.002, IQR: 0.001, 0.004) while pushing the
rush hour estimates away from the reference (median: -0.003, IQR: -0.005, -0.001). We discuss
these results further in the discussion in the context of exposure measurement error. Figure
S15 shows the point estimates and 95% CIs of selected designs. Sensitivity analyses restricted to
participants enrolled since 2010 produced similar results (Table S3).

4 Discussion
We found no strong evidence of an association between higher UFP exposures and lower latelife cognitive function in the ACT cohort. These findings are generally in line with the mixed
results reported in the literature regarding the relationship between UFPs and brain health
outcomes (Blanco et al., 2024; Brugge & Fuller, 2020; Gan et al., 2023; Weichenthal et al.,
2020). Additionally, we observed that mobile monitoring campaigns can produce robust air
pollution exposure models even with reduced sampling efforts, so long as data are collected

following spatially and temporally balanced approaches. Applying exposure surfaces from these
reduced monitoring designs generally yielded health associations consistent with those from
the all-data exposure model, with the exception of business and rush hour designs, which
showed less consistent results.
A focus of this study was on evaluating the impact of air pollution mobile monitoring
campaigns, which are increasingly implemented to address monitoring gaps (Kim et al., 2023),
on health inferences. Guidance for epidemiologic applications has been limited (Blanco,
Doubleday, et al., 2022; Blanco et al., 2023; Blanco, Gassett, et al., 2022; Doubleday et al.,
2023), and monitoring approaches greatly vary. While the number of monitoring sites, visits,
campaign duration, and sampling times can meaningfully impact exposure prediction models
(Blanco, Doubleday, et al., 2022; Blanco et al., 2023), we further show how these differences
translate to epidemiologic inferences.
When compared to the all-data monitoring campaign, campaigns with fewer visits (4-12)
but no temporal restrictions, shorter durations (2-3 seasons), and a fixed number of visits
across sites (12) produced only slightly worse exposure model performances (Figure S7); highly
correlated (mostly >~0.85 ) participant exposures (Figure S13); and health inferences with only
a small degree of variability (Figure 2). As expected, shorter campaigns (e.g., one season) and
those with fewer repeat site visits (e.g., 4) generally had worse performing exposure models.
Rush hour and especially business hour designs, had much worse exposure model
performances, more variable participant exposure assessments, and health estimates that were
inconsistent and generally more differed from the primary health effect estimates despite
predicting exposures that were moderately (business) and highly (rush) correlated with
exposures from the all-data model. Moreover, the health estimates associated with these
monitoring campaigns were different from all other designs, including shorter (e.g., 1 season vs
year-around) campaigns and those with fewer samples (e.g., 4 vs 12 site visits), suggesting that
capturing temporal variability through extended hours designs might better summarize longterm annual average exposures. It's notable that these reduced day and hour campaigns are
most common in the field since an operator is required to drive a vehicle and monitor
instrumentation throughout the sampling period. Unfortunately, business hours designs may
systematically capture lower-than-average air pollution times since they miss elevated rush
hour and overnight concentrations. While rush hour designs collect data over fewer hours in a
day, those hours may better represent longer-term averages in some situations.
Temporally adjusting business hours design data did not generally improve the health
estimates (Figure 2, Figure S8, Figure S9). Prior work has also reported worse performing
exposure models after applying a temporal adjustment when compared to not applying one at
all (Chastko & Adams, 2019). This may be due to the heterogeneity in temporal patterns across
different sites, which can be influenced by variable nearby sources such as airports, highways,
or industrial areas (Blanco, Doubleday, et al., 2022). Applying a single site’s temporal pattern to
a larger study region may thus incorrectly or insufficiently adjust temporally restricted
measures.
While there were some instances where health inferences were improved, the added
complexity of temporal adjustment might have introduced classical-like measurement error,

reducing prediction accuracy. However, the improved temporal alignment may have decreased
Berkson-like error, which was responsible for the dominant bias in health effect estimation
from the unadjusted exposure estimates (Szpiro et al., 2011; Szpiro & Paciorek, 2013). In cases
where inferences did not improve, the temporal adjustment might have introduced classicallike measurement error without sufficiently addressing or worsening Berkson-like error. Prior
work has also shown that exposure measurement error can bias health inferences, and that the
direction of the bias is unclear and not always towards the null (Bergen & Szpiro, 2015; Brenner
& Loomis, 1994). Given that unbalanced monitoring designs may be challenging to improve
with existing temporal adjustment approaches, these findings further highlight the importance
of monitoring design, as reiterated below. Notably, the degree of bias will depend on true
underlying exposure-outcome associations and realized monitoring design.
Interestingly, collecting less balanced visit data across sites generally resulted in worse
and more variable exposure models, but this had a less pronounced impact on health
inferences (Figure S7 and Figure 2). For epidemiologic applications, it may be acceptable to
collect fewer visits at certain locations if logistical challenges arise, as long as the samples
remain temporally balanced. It is important to note that there are various ways in which field
sampling can lead to unbalanced data collection, and our approach reflects just one scenario
based on the observed data. While fully balanced sampling designs are not always feasible in
practice, they can be approximated in the field by using geographic information, among other
methods. Defining target sites becomes increasingly complex when multiple pollutants are of
interest since spatial patterns can vary greatly between different pollutants.
Spatial and temporal compatibility between monitoring and cohort locations (i.e., similarity
in the spatial distribution and time period of interest) is an important component of minimizing
the impact of measurement error on health inferences (Szpiro & Paciorek, 2013). Our study is
inherently spatially aligned since the full mobile monitoring campaign was specifically designed
to capture exposures for the ACT cohort (Blanco, Gassett, et al., 2022). Moreover, the design of
the all-data campaign generally estimates unbiased annual average exposures, as we have
previously shown (Blanco, Doubleday, et al., 2022). On the other hand, the day and time
restricted designs sample during times that are temporally misaligned with the longer-term
exposures of interest. These designs contribute to bias from Berkson-like error, which is the
difference between the true annual average exposure surface and the more limited part
captured by the modeling process (Szpiro & Paciorek, 2013). The ideal way to eliminate the bias
from temporal misalignment is by modifying the sampling design. Future research can explore
whether the available data collected can be leveraged to better support more comprehensive
spatiotemporal modeling that better adjusts for and captures the underlying surface. While
reweighting the data may be one simple approach, this may not be possible with very restricted
designs like business hours approaches where large periods of critical time periods are missing.
More generally, our monitoring design findings are conservative with respect to realized
campaigns, which may perform worse than the designs tested here. Field campaigns often
incorporate multiple features that can limit their ability to assess long-term population
exposures, including monitoring for less than a year, collecting few repeat visits per location

(median ~4), sampling exclusively during weekday business hours, and collecting a variable
number of measurements per location (Kim et al., 2023).
This study was conducted in the ACT cohort, which has consistently and extensively
collected cognitive outcomes, demographics, and other measures from older participants since
its inception in 1994. More generally, these analyses are most relevant for older White
populations who are fairly well educated given the demographics of the cohort. The low levels
of air pollution in the region and the strong correlation between air pollution and SES (Hajat et
al., 2015) may explain why we observed no strong evidence of an association between UFP and
cognitive function in primary analyses. While there may be some residual confounding and we
could have implemented more complex analyses, a focus of this study was on estimating the
health inference bias and variability when using exposure models developed from common
restricted sampling campaigns. Any analytic concerns would have remained constant across
monitoring designs, thus allowing us to still capture trends. Moreover, our prior work
investigating UFPs and dementia in ACT reported consistent results of no evidence of an
association across an extensive set of sensitivity and secondary analyses, suggesting that our
analytic choices had a limited impact on our results (Blanco et al., 2024).
A feature of our temporal adjustment approach is that it was based on a simulated UFP
monitoring site, which produced good PNC predictions and captured much of the temporal
variation observed for UFP (Figure S2 – Figure S4). Various temporal adjustment approaches are
used in the literature, and these can themselves produce fluctuating adjustment factors. And
while we used hourly adjustment factors to adjust two-minute mobile monitoring readings, we
have previously shown that hourly and minute-level concentrations are highly correlated
(Blanco, Doubleday, et al., 2022).
Notably, our use of 2019 UFP exposures inherently adds exposure measurement error to
all our analyses, particularly for earlier time periods. Historical UFP data are limited, and we
assumed that the exposure surface remained constant over time in these analyses (Blanco,
2021; Blanco et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2017; Levy et al., 2015; Meng et al., 2019; Molter et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2011). While our results were similar when we restricted analyses to more
recent years, it will be important to replicate these and longitudinal analyses as longer-term
UFP exposure models become available.
Finally, most mobile monitoring campaigns explicitly collect non-stationary, on-road data.
These achieve higher spatial coverage than temporary roadside designs like the one used in this
study, but they have unique challenges that should be investigated. This includes the collection
of higher concentrations that are more influenced by high tailpipe emissions and at locations
further from residences of interest; the collecting of fewer measurements per location (seconds
vs minutes) that make for more unstable estimates; and initially poorer performing exposure
models (Doubleday et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023).
In conclusion, we saw no strong evidence of an association between higher UFP
exposures and lower late-life cognitive function. Future studies should replicate this work as
longer-term UFP exposure models become available. Thoughtful monitoring design can
enhance exposure assessment and, while potentially less critical in some settings, can support
epidemiologic analyses. Campaigns restricted to weekday business or rush hour designs
produced worse exposures and less accurate health inferences. Campaigns might consider
