Abstract
We propose a generic, modular framework to optimize the placement of continuous monitoring sensors on oil and gas sites aiming to maximize the methane emissions
detection efficiency. Our proposed framework substantially expands the problem scale
compared to previous related studies and can be adapted for different objectives in
sensor placement. This optimization framework is comprised of five steps: (1) simulate
emission scenarios using site-specific wind and emission information; (2) set possible
sensor locations under consideration of the site layout and any site-specific constraints;
(3) simulate methane concentrations for each pair of emission scenario and possible
sensor location; (4) determine emissions detection based on the site-specific simulated
concentrations; and (5) select the best subset of sensor locations, under a given sensor
budget, using genetic algorithms combined with Pareto optimization. We demonstrate
the practicality and effectiveness of our framework through its application to an oil and
gas emission testing facility with a large search space of possible sensor locations; a
setting which is computationally infeasible to solve with commonly used mixed-integer
linear programming formulations. Additionally, a case study illustrates the success-

Synopsis: We develop a sensor placement optimization framework for continuous monitoring systems for methane emissions detection on oil and gas sites.

Introduction
Mitigating anthropogenic methane emissions is pivotal for achieving the goal of limiting
increase in the global average temperature to below 1.5◦ C above pre-industrial levels set
by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. 1,2 Oil and gas emerges as a key sector for reducing
emissions, contributing 22% of the global anthropogenic methane emissions 3,4 and 32% in
the United States. 5 In June 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $850 million in federal funding aimed at
reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. 6 Methane emissions from this sector
are characterized by significant temporal fluctuations, 7,8 with sporadic, short-lived events of
high emissions—known as super emitter events—accounting for a substantial portion of the
total emissions. 9,10 In this context, Continuous Monitoring Systems (CMS), comprising multiple point-in-space sensors that continuously measure methane concentrations, are becoming
increasingly vital for emission monitoring. They offer near real-time tracking capabilities essential for identifying both highly fluctuating emissions and transient super emitters. 11–13
CMS plays a crucial role in detecting, localizing, and quantifying site emissions. 14–16
CMS sensor placement, the strategy of positioning multiple fixed point sensors on an oil
and gas site, significantly affects the efficiency of methane emissions detection, especially
when considering a limited sensor budget. 17 Sensor placement optimization has been extensively studied in environmental monitoring applications such as air pollutant monitoring, 18,19

water contamination monitoring, 20–24 temperature monitoring, 25,26 and wind monitoring. 27,28
The goal is to optimize the locations of a limited number of sensors to maximize objectives
such as coverage, detection capability, and data quality for subsequent analyses. Until recently, sensor placement optimization for methane emission monitoring on oil and gas sites
had not been extensively studied due to CMS being a relatively new technology. Other
methane emission monitoring technologies, such as satellite, 29 aerial monitoring systems, 30
and handheld optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras, 31 do not require sensor placement. These
systems can either cover entire sites (e.g., satellite and aerial systems) or be moved to various locations on-site (e.g., OGI). In contrast, as a ground-based monitoring system, CMS
involves sensors that cannot be easily moved, and a limited number of sensors cannot cover
an entire site. Therefore, effective sensor placement optimization methods are essential for
maximizing the efficiency of methane emissions detection.
In the realm of methane emission monitoring at oil and gas sites, Klise et al. 32 developed
a sensor placement optimization framework designed to enhance the detection capabilities of
sensor networks. This framework begins by employing site-specific wind data and emission
characteristics to create simulated emission scenarios, thereby closely approximating the actual conditions present at the site. Following this, the framework applies mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) to identify optimal sensor placements. Klise et al. 32 showcased their
methodology through a case study within a confined space of 100 x 100 x 10 meters, arranging potential sensor locations at intervals of 10 meters horizontally and 1 meter vertically,
culminating in a search space comprising 100,000 potential sensor locations. This complexity
is further amplified by introducing three sensor categories with different detection threshold
and cost, expanding the search space to 300,000 distinct configurations. Moreover, to refine
the simulation of real-world conditions, 1,200 emission scenarios were generated, capturing
a range of meteorological conditions and emission patterns. Building upon Klise et al. 32 ’s
foundational work, Zi et al. 33 introduced a novel approach by incorporating wind condition uncertainties and employing a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) strategy to

bolster the sensor network’s detection robustness, particularly in worst-case scenarios. This
methodology was evaluated using the same spatial domain as in Klise et al. 32 ’s study, demonstrating significant improvements in detection capabilities. Both studies leveraged MILP for
optimization, showcasing its efficacy in smaller search spaces. However practical applications
such as reducing sensor spatial resolution to 1 meter on oil gas sites or extending the analysis
to larger regions reveal the limitations of MILP due to its computational demands, which
escalate exponentially with the increase in decision variables — in this context, the potential
sensor locations. Although advanced computational strategies like branch-and-bound 34 or
branch-and-cut 35 can alleviate some computational burdens, the nature of MILP algorithm
means that solving them remains NP-hard in the most challenging scenarios.
In the present study, we endeavor to expand the search space for potential sensor locations
and advocate for the utilization of genetic algorithms (GAs) 36 to overcome the computational
challenges encountered with MILP. GAs, distinguished by their emulation of natural selection
processes, demonstrate high efficiency in navigating extensive and intricate solution spaces.
Through the application of evolutionary mechanisms such as selection, crossover, and mutation, GAs are posited to achieve near-optimal solutions with greater rapidity and reduced
computational burden compared to conventional MILP methods, particularly in instances
where exact optimization proves to be computationally prohibitive. GAs have been widely
used in sensor placement optimization across various applications, including structural health
monitoring 37 and seismic building monitoring. 38 While GAs do not guarantee finding the exact optimal solution, their high efficiency in finding a sub-optimal solution that is very close
to the optimum makes them well-suited for applications in methane emissions detection on
oil and gas sites, where errors in the modeled emissions make an exact solution superfluous.
Within this context, we conceptualize the sensor placement as a multi-objective optimization
problem guided by the principles of Pareto optimization 39 which entails the simultaneous
optimization of multiple conflicting objectives. Specifically, our objective is twofold: first,
to identify a subset of sensor locations that optimizes detection capabilities, and second, to

4
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-5qcnw ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-4812 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

ensure that the number of selected sensors remains within a predetermined sensor budget.
To address this dual-objective optimization problem, we employ the method developed by
Qian et al. 40 which leverages GAs to facilitate an effective solution search.
Compared to the work of Klise et al. 32 and Zi et al. 33 , we use a much higher spatial resolution to define possible sensor locations resulting in finding a sensor placement with higher
detection efficiency. Also, we utilize all available wind data for a site with a resolution of one
minute to achieve a more precise approximation of the actual meteorological conditions at
the site. Moreover, we simulate methane emissions with the Gaussian puff model rather than
the Gaussian plume model owing to its superior accuracy in capturing the dynamics of atmospheric dispersion by allowing for variable wind conditions. As a result of the aforementioned
enhancements, our sensor placement optimization algorithm delivers solutions of increased
accuracy and granularity, thereby offering substantial benefits for practical applications. As
such our algorithm offers an effective solution for optimal sensor placement which can serve
as an open-source reference tool for CMS technology vendors and advance the quest towards
rapid elimination of methane emissions on oil and gas sites.

Methods
In this study, we introduce a data-driven algorithm designed to optimize the placement of
CMS sensors. The algorithm is modular and a visual summary of the algorithm is provided
in Section S1 in the Supporting Information (SI) document. The algorithm requires three
critical inputs: site-specific wind patterns, emission characteristics, and a predefined sensor
budget which dictates the number of sensors that can be deployed. Utilizing these inputs, our
algorithm calculates the optimal sensor arrangement within the budget, aiming to maximize
emission detection efficiency, defined as the frequency or likelihood with which at least one
sensor in the system detects an emission. Detection efficiency, the objective to be optimized
in the sensor placement problem, can also be defined using other metrics such as time to

first detection or detection fraction based on total time or amount of emissions. Due to the
flexibility of GAs, the objective function can be adjusted accordingly without altering the
entire framework. The workflow of the algorithm is structured into five distinct steps:
1. Generation of numerous emission scenarios that reflect the site’s actual emission characteristics and wind conditions.
2. Specification of possible sensor locations based on site geometry and operational guidelines if any.
3. Simulation of methane concentrations at all possible sensor locations for each emission
scenario.
4. Evaluation of detection for each sensor location and emission scenario pair.
5. Optimization of sensor placements that ensure maximum detection across all scenarios
under a given budget.
In the following subsections, we first outline the experimental data utilized to showcase
our algorithm. We then detail each step by first providing a general description and then
explaining the experimental approach used in this study. It is important to reiterate that
our algorithm is highly modular and that the components demonstrated in our experimental
study, such as the wind and emission distribution estimators and the atmospheric transport
model, can be readily replaced.

Data description
To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we employ wind data acquired from
the 2022 Advancing Development of Emissions Detection (ADED) campaign 41 conducted
at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC), which was operational
from January 28 to May 16, 2022. Due to data availability and for demonstration purposes,
we used a period of less than four months of wind data. In practice, a full year of wind

data is recommended to accurately represent the actual meteorological conditions, including
seasonal variations, at the site. This is implemented in the case study of a real oil and gas site
as detailed in the final section of this manuscript. The configuration of the METEC site is
illustrated in Figure 1(a), where five distinct sets of equipment are outlined, each representing
a potential emission source. Wind speed and direction were continuously recorded by three
on-site anemometers throughout this period, with data captured at one-minute intervals.
For the purposes of our analysis, we assumed wind conditions to be homogeneous across
the site, thereby aggregating the data from the three anemometers to compute mean wind
speed and direction. Note that the calculation of wind direction used the circular mean,
appropriately addressing the circular nature of directional data. Figure 1(b) shows the wind
rose that describes the wind distribution throughout the period.

(METEC) site. Potential emission source locations are marked with colored boxes. (b) Distribution of wind data during the Advancing Development of Emissions Detection (ADED)
experiment period from January 28 to May 16, 2022.

Step 1. Generation of emission scenarios
In accordance with the definition in Klise et al. 32 , an emission scenario is determined by
a combination of wind conditions and emission characteristics during a period of time. To

7
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-5qcnw ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-4812 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

generate emission scenarios, two probability distribution functions are constructed: a joint
distribution fe of emission source attributes including locations x0 , durations τ , and rate q,
and a joint distribution fw of wind speed ws(t) and wind direction wd(t), t ∈ [0, τ ]. The
wind distribution can be inferred from historical wind data recorded on or in the vicinity of
the site. The emission distribution can be obtained from operational logs and/or expertise
from operators. Practically, we can decompose the joint distribution fe using conditional
distributions, i.e., fe (x0 , τ, q) = f (τ, q|x0 )×f (x0 ). That is, each potential source, based on its
functionality, may have its own emission pattern. The two distributions fw and fe are deemed
independent, which we believe to be a reasonable assumption since the wind conditions
should not affect the source attributes of an emission event and vice versa. Nevertheless, it
is acknowledged that correlations may arise via confounding temporal factors. For instance, a
certain type of emission may tend to occur at a specific hour of the day or in a specific season
when the wind might have a specific pattern. In cases where prior knowledge pertaining to
such relationships is available, it can be readily incorporated into the distributions facilitating
a more nuanced modeling approach. Then, emission scenarios, which are defined by a tuple
of (x0 , q, τ, ws(t), wd(t), t ∈ [0, τ ]), are generated by randomly sampling from fe and fw .
In this case study, we consider only single-source emissions because our goal is to maximize detection efficiency. Thus, achieving successful detection of single-source emissions
should inherently guarantee success in detecting multiple-source emissions. For demonstration purposes, we fix the emission duration for each emission event to be one hour and
assume all five equipment have equal likelihood to be an emission source. Additionally,
we prescribe three possible emission rates, [1, 5, 10] kg/h to each of the potential emission sources with equal probability. This constructs a simple uniform distribution, i.e.,
P (x0,i , qj ) = 1/15, i = 1, 2, . . . , 5, j = 1, 2, 3. It’s important to mention that the fixed
duration value, emission rates and probabilities we used in this experiment are only for
demonstration purpose. In practice, a realistic distribution should be derived based on actual site-specific data and practitioners’ insights, and an example of this guidance is provided

8

in the case study at the end of this paper. For wind data, we approximate the true wind
distribution fw by using one-hour non-overlapping segments from the historical wind data
throughout the entire experiment period to reflect the actual meteorological conditions on
the site within the experiment period. In practice, a full year of wind data is desired to thoroughly represent the actual meteorological conditions, including seasonal patterns, which is
implemented in the case study for a real oil and gas site. Finally, this yields a total number
of 38,685 emission scenarios which comprehensively represent the actual emission conditions
on the site during the experiment period.

Step 2. Specification of possible sensor locations
The determination of possible sensor locations is contingent upon the desired spatial search
grid resolution as well as the geometry of the site. Specifically, areas occupied by equipment
or driveways must be excluded from the search space. Furthermore, regions restricted by
operational guidelines also necessitate exclusion. In summary, information regarding the
search grid resolution sought by the site operator and any pertinent restrictions is essential
for the specification of possible sensor locations.
In this case study, we first set possible sensor locations by creating a 3D grid over the
entire site. The resolution for the two horizontal directions (Northing and Easting) is 1 m
while the resolution for the vertical direction is 0.5 m. The dimensions of the METEC site
are approximately 125 meters in Easting and 75 meters in Northing. Considering practical
feasibility, the vertical range was designated as spanning from 1 to 10 meters. Subsequently,
we excluded all points within the grid that were occluded by any of the five equipment
groups present on the site. This exclusion process resulted in a total of 21,774 viable sensor
locations, forming the search space for the subsequent optimization analysis. Figure 2 shows
the possible sensor locations as well as the potential emission sources on the METEC site.
The gap areas correspond to spaces obstructed by equipment and hence devoid of possible
sensor locations.

Step 3. Simulation of methane concentrations
In this step, we simulate methane concentrations for each emission scenario generated in
Step 1 at all potential sensor locations specified in Step 2, using an atmospheric transport
model. This step is summarized by Equation 1:

cji (t) = g (x0,i , qi , wsi (t), wdi (t); xj ) , t ∈ [0, τ ], i = 1, 2, . . . , M ; j = 1, 2, . . . , N.

(1)

Here, cji represents the simulated methane concentration time series for emission scenario i
at sensor location j; M and N denote the total numbers of emission scenarios and potential
sensor locations, respectively; g is the atmospheric transport model. We will use these
simulated methane concentrations to assess detection capabilities at each sensor location for
each emission scenario.
In our experiment, the simulations were conducted using the Gaussian puff model which
is more accurate than the Gaussian plume model as it accounts for the wind dynamics
within the simulation period (see Jia et al. 42 for details). All the parameters used in the
Gaussian puff simulations are listed in Section S2 of the SI. We note that other, e.g. more
sophisticated, atmospheric transport models can straightforwardly be integrated within the
proposed optimization framework by replacing the Gaussian Puff model. Finally, there are
a total of 38, 685 × 21, 774 = 842, 327, 190 one-hour simulated concentration time series.
Memory issues arise when dealing with such large data. To address it, we utilize memorymapping files provided in Numpy 43 to store the data.

Step 4. Evaluation of detection
In this step, we establish detection of every sensor location and emission scenario pair based
on the simulated methane concentrations cji obtained in the previous step. We then combine
all the detection results into a single detection matrix which serves as the input to the final
optimization problem.

We determine detection by applying two thresholds to the simulated methane concentrations: an amplitude threshold, A, to identify significant high values and a temporal threshold,
B, to ensure the persistency of the high readings. Therefore, a successful detection is defined
to be elevated concentrations above A ppm for more than B% of the total time steps in a
simulated concentration time series as shown in Equation 2.

∥c(t) ≥ A∥1 ≥ |c(t)| · B%

(2)

where c(t) is the simulated methane concentration time series (or vector); ∥ · ∥1 is the L1
norm of a vector and | · | is the length of a vector. The value of A will typically be set as
a function of the sensor quality, with lower quality sensors requiring a higher threshold to
distinguish true spikes from the noisy background which consists of ambient atmospheric
concentrations and sensor noise. Since we use simulated concentrations in this step, representing concentration enhancements in the observed data, the detection threshold A should
be based on the background variations in the observed data to ensure that the signal corresponding to true emissions stands out. Specifically, A is set to be the difference between
the upper bound and the lower bound of the background concentration, ensuring that any
concentration enhancement above A is guaranteed not to be drowned out by the background.
The value of B dependents on the tolerance for false positives. In practice, sporadic spikes
may correspond to sensor malfunctions or error from raw data processing rather than actual
emissions. We need a metric to evaluate the persistence of the high values defined using the
amplitude threshold A. In this study, we use an amplitude threshold of A = 0.5 ppm and
B = 20% for the main analysis. An example of a successful detection is illustrated in Section
S3 of the SI. We also analyzed how different sensor types may affect the detection efficiency
by using A = 5.0 ppm and B = 20% to generate results corresponding to a lower quality
sensor. There are various ways to define detection which can be easily accommodated within
our framework, and we included a brief analysis of different choices in Section S4 of the SI.

Next, we synthesize all detection results to construct a detection matrix, denoted as D,
whose rows correspond to sensor locations and columns to emission scenarios. The entries
of the matrix are binary; zero indicates a non-detection for a specific scenario at that sensor
location, and one indicates a detection, see Equation 3.

Dij =




1 if emission scenario j is detected at sensor location i,

(3)



0 otherwise.

Step 5. Optimization of sensor placement
In the final step, we find the optimal sensor placement under a given sensor budget. Using
the detection matrix D constructed in the previous step, we can model the optimization
problem as a best subset selection problem. Recall that the rows of the detection matrix
correspond to possible sensor locations and columns to emission scenarios. Given the sensor
budget k, i.e, the number of sensors to install, selecting k sensors translates to selecting k
(k)

rows from the detection matrix. In the resulting sub-matrix Dsub , we assess the column-wise
sums which indicate the number of sensors that detect the corresponding emission scenario.
The number of non-zero column-wise sums is the total number of detected emission scenarios,
which is called detection coverage. The objective is to find the optimal selection of k rows
from this matrix to maximize the detection coverage.
The next step is to apply Pareto optimization to the best subset selection problem we have
formulated. Pareto optimization has been developed to handle situations with conflicting
objectives. In our case, we want to find a subset of rows from the detection matrix to
maximize the detection coverage, while minimizing the size of the subset, that is, using
fewer sensors if possible. The Pareto optimization problem is formulated by following the

f (x), ∥x∥1 ≤ 2k

(4)

g2 (x) = −∥x∥1
Here, N is the number of rows of the detection matrix, x is a binary vector of length N and
xi = 1 if the ith row of the detection matrix is selected; f is the detection coverage and
∥x∥1 is the L1 norm of the binary vector which is the number of selected rows. Note that for
solutions which unduly exceed the budget (by two times in this setting), the corresponding
objective value in g1 is set to be negative infinity to make the subsequent searching process
more efficient.
For large-scale optimization problems, such as those involving matrices with dimension in
the order of hundreds of thousands, traditional approaches like exhaustive search or standard
MILP algorithms are impractical due to their computational cost. Instead, here we use
genetic algorithms, a type of randomized algorithms to efficiently search a solution that is
close to the optimal one. By conducting selection, mutation, and combination operations
inspired by natural selection, the solutions evolve to an optimal or near optimal state in
an efficient way. Specifically, we use the Pareto optimization with recombination for subset
selection (PORSS) proposed by Qian et al. 40 . The pseudo-code for the algorithm is presented
in Section S5 in the SI and the full code is available at the GitHub repository provided at
the end of this paper. The algorithm accepts three primary inputs: a detection matrix D,
a sensor budget k, and an objective function g1 which is the detection coverage in this case.
The iterative nature of the algorithm is governed by the parameter I, specifying the total
number of iterations to execute. The desired output is an optimized subset comprising no
more than k rows from the detection matrix D that maximizes the objective function g1 .
13
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-5qcnw ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-4812 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

Given the monotonic property of g1 , which ensures that the objective value of the original set
is always greater than or equal to that of any of its subsets, the output will consist precisely
of k rows.
We start with a null vector x of length N , the total number of possible sensor locations,
initializing a solution population set P with this vector. The iteration counter i is set to
zero to track the progression of the algorithm.
The core of the algorithm is an iterative loop that continues until either the iteration
counter i reaches the predefined limit I or the prescribed early stop condition is satisfied.
Within each iteration, the following steps are undertaken:
1. Selection: A pair of vectors, x, y, are randomly chosen from the solution population
set P .
2. Recombination: The selected vectors undergo a recombination process to produce offspring vectors x′ , y′ . Specifically, a cut point is randomly selected to split each of x, y
into two segments: (x1 , x2 ), (y1 , y2 ). Then, x1 is combined with y2 , and y1 is combined
with x2 to produce the offspring vectors x′ and y′ .
3. Mutation: A bit-wise mutation is applied to the offspring x′ and y′ , resulting in new
vectors x′′ , y′′ . Specifically, a subset of points is randomly selected, and the values at
these points are swapped between 0 and 1 to produce the new vectors x′′ , y′′ .
4. Survival of the Fittest: For each of x′′ and y′′ , the algorithm assesses whether it represents an improvement over the existing solutions in P . Only vectors not dominated
by any member of P are retained. Here, we define a solution x dominating another
solution x′ , i.e, x ≻ x′ if g1 (x) ≥ g1 (x′ ) and g2 (x) ≥ g2 (x′ ) and either g1 (x) > g1 (x′ )
or g2 (x) > g2 (x′ ).
5. Early Termination: At the end of each iteration, an early stop condition is evaluated
to determine if the optimization can be concluded ahead of schedule.

Upon reaching the termination criterion, the algorithm concludes by selecting from P
the solution x that adheres to the budget constraint k and maximizes the objective function
g1 .
The proposed algorithm demonstrates a robust capability for optimizing complex subset
selection problems. Through the iterative process of selection, recombination, mutation, and
survival of the fittest, the algorithm converges towards an optimal or near-optimal solution.
The inclusion of an early termination condition enhances computational efficiency, enabling
the algorithm to halt upon sufficient convergence, thereby saving computational resources.
To address the inherent stochastic nature of genetic algorithms which can result in diverse outcomes due to their random selection and mutation processes, we have implemented
a strategy that involves running multiple independent genetic algorithms in parallel. By
conducting these algorithms separately, we can harness the variability in their search patterns, thereby mitigating the risk of converging to local optima that might be mistaken for
global solutions. Upon completion of these independent runs, we aggregate their results,
systematically comparing and combining the distinct solutions to identify the most optimal
outcomes. This approach not only leverages the exploratory strengths of genetic algorithms
but also significantly enhances the robustness of the solution set, ensuring that the best
possible solutions are identified amidst the randomness.
To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we generated test data with known ground
truth. These test data were designed to present more challenging scenarios than the original
problem in this study, and our algorithm successfully identified the true solution in all cases.
Detailed descriptions and results of the tests are provided in Section S6 of the SI.

Results
We first present the optimal placement of sensors across the METEC site, considering various
sensor budget constraints ranging from 1 to 12. For each budget level, we conducted 20

independent optimization trials and aggregated the results to identify the most effective
sensor configuration. Figure 2 showcases exemplary configurations for the optimal placement
of four and eight sensors, with additional configurations for varying budgets detailed in
Section S7 of the SI. The sensors’ horizontal positions are marked with red dots, while
their heights are denoted by corresponding numbers. The top row shows the optimal sensor
placements by searching from all possible sensor locations specified in Step 2 across the entire
site. The detection coverage achieved by these configurations is 0.52 and 0.75 for the foursensor and eight-sensor systems, respectively, indicating that the systems could detect 52%
and 75% of simulated emission scenarios, respectively. Not surprisingly, the arrangement
of the best sensor placement is clearly informed by the predominant wind directions from
the northwest and southeast (see Figure 1(b)). Additionally, the sensor heights are highly
correlated with the heights of the emission sources. In situations where operational guidelines
restrict sensor installation exclusively to the perimeter of a site, we also explore optimal
fenceline sensor placements. Adhering to the methodology outlined in the Methods section,
we limited potential sensor locations to a narrow zone along the site boundary, specifically
within a 2-meter buffer area. The bottom row shows the optimal configurations for placing
four and eight sensors, as determined by our algorithm. Again, the arrangement of the
optimal sensor placements is informed by the predominant wind directions. Specifically,
rather than being uniformly distributed along the perimeter, the sensors are shifted towards
the northwest and southeast direction, the predominant wind directions over the experiment
period. The four sensor locations in the best four-sensor solution are approximately retained
in the best eight-sensor solution, but their heights are adjusted to synergize with the newly
added sensors, enhancing detection efficiency.

Figure 2: Optimal placements for four and eight sensors as determined by the PORSS
algorithm. The top row shows the optimal sensor placements across the entire site, and the
bottom row shows the optimal sensor placements constrained along the fenceline of the site.
Gray dots indicate possible sensor locations, while blue stars represent potential emission
source locations, with their heights indicated by the adjacent numbers. Red dots denote
the sensors selected by the algorithm, with their corresponding heights also indicated by
the adjacent numbers. The optimal placement of four sensors across the site and along the
fenceline achieves detection coverage of 52% and 47%, respectively. The optimal placement
of eight sensors across the site and along the fenceline achieves detection coverage of 75%
and 70%, respectively.

Figure 3 illustrates the detection coverage ratio, the proportion of detected emission
scenarios out of the total emission scenarios generated in Step 1, achieved with the optimal
sensor placement for each budget. The blue lines show the coverage ratio associated with the

optimal sensor placements derived by the PORSS algorithm in this setting. The observed
trend indicates diminishing returns in terms of detection coverage with increasing sensor
budgets. This type of analysis enables us to determine the minimum number of sensors
required for a desired detection coverage. Additionally, we compared the results under two
different detection amplitude thresholds: 0.5 ppm and 5 ppm representing high and low
end sensors, respectively. Low-end sensors generally exhibit larger background variation
compared to high-end sensors and hence require higher detection thresholds. 44 The analysis
shows that to achieve a specific detection coverage ratio, more low-end sensors are needed.
For example, to achieve a detection coverage ratio of 0.50, four high-end sensors or nine
low-end sensors are required. In practice, operators can use this analysis to decide on the
sensor type and the corresponding number of sensors.
The effectiveness of the PORSS algorithm was further evaluated by benchmarking it
against a greedy search method which served as the baseline for comparison. In the greedy
search approach, the best current row is iteratively chosen based on a continually updated
detection matrix. This matrix evolves by excluding previously selected rows and any columns
containing at least a value of one across these rows. As depicted in Figure 3, the solutions
derived from the PORSS algorithm represented by the blue lines consistently outperform
those obtained through the greedy search method represented by orange lines for both lowand high-end sensors. Notably, for the single-sensor (best-1) configuration, the solution
identified by the greedy search is considered the ground truth, which PORSS successfully
matched. This outcome underscores the PORSS algorithm’s ability to find optimal solutions.

Case Study for a Prototypical Midstream Oil and Gas Site
In this section, we present a case study demonstrating our sensor placement algorithm in
a real-world scenario at the request of a site operator. The study illustrates how operator
knowledge and site constraints can be incorporated into our optimization scheme for an
actual midstream oil and gas site. The site operator and site locations are anonomyzed for
confidentiality.
This site initially had nine industry-standard sensors placed on the perimeter fenceline,
following the vendors recommendation. The operator wanted to compare this setup to a new
configuration using four higher-quality sensors. Given that precise placement becomes more
critical with fewer sensors, our framework was used to determine the optimal locations for
the new sensors under the operator constraint of restricting placement to the fenceline at a
2-meter height to facilitate installation and minimize operational interference.
Our optimization framework was configured as follows:
Wind Data Wind data was collected over a year at one-minute intervals from two anemometers co-located with the existing sensors. To create a single time series for our framework, we averaged the wind speed and direction (x and y component wise) when both
anemometers had data, using the available value when one was NA. Instances with
both NA (0.684% of the data) remained NA. We then randomly selected 1,000 nonconsecutive hours of gap-free data, with the sampled distribution closely matching the
full year’s data (see Figure 4).
Emission Scenarios Operator guidance indicated that the 10 site compressors were the
primary sources of fugitive emissions, and overflight data had suggested that emissions
of 5 kg/hr were typical. We simulated emissions using these values across the 1,000
hourly wind data samples for each compressor, generating 1,000 scenarios per compressor and 10,000 total for all sources combined, allowing us to find the overall optimal
placement.

Simulation, Detection, and Optimization All simulations used the Gaussian puff model
with parameters listed in Section S2 of the SI. For each simulation, we recorded the
candidate locations along the 2 m resolution site fenceline where the simulated methane
concentration exceeded 1 ppm for at least 1 minute in accordance with a conservative
estimate of sensor sensitivity provided by the sensor vendor. We first determined optimal sensor placements for each compressor individually (see Figure S8 in the SI)
then combined the results to create a single detection matrix D as described in Step
4. The PORSS algorithm (see Step 5) was then used to find the optimal sensor locations. Lastly, we verified our solution’s stability by comparing it against 10 million
random samples of 4 sensor locations along the fenceline, imposing a 30 m minimum
distance between sensors. The PORSS algorithm found the optimal solution in 210
seconds, about 30 times faster than evaluating the random samples which took 6,177
seconds, with nearly identical results but a slightly higher coverage ratio for the PORSS
algorithm (see Figure S9 in SI).
The site operators have installed the four new sensors in the recommended locations
and are actively recording data as of this paper’s publication. While a detailed comparison between these four advanced sensors and the nine existing ones is beyond this paper’s
scope, this case study illustrates the practical implementation of our framework, integrating
operator knowledge effectively.

Conclusion
In this work, we introduced an open-source data-driven algorithm for optimizing sensor
placement on oil and gas sites. The demonstration example (METEC experiment) and the
real oil and gas site case study outlined in this paper detail the workflow and highlight
the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed framework. This algorithm provides site-specific
solutions that are more accurate and reliable than traditional sensor placement strategies and

those proposed in prior studies. 32,33 Additionally, our algorithm’s analysis of the relationship
between sensor budget and detection efficiency is crucial for operators when making decisions
during the planning phase.
Our approach significantly expands the problem scale compared to prior research in
related studies by efficiently solving large-scale problems often encountered in practice. Further, the high modularity of our algorithm allows users to incorporate their own methods
and models, such as wind and emission distribution estimators (in cases with limited or no
existing wind data) or different atmospheric transport models. As such, the algorithm holds
substantial practical value, particularly as the use of Continuous Monitoring Systems (CMS)
becomes increasingly prevalent and critical in the quest to rapidly reduce methane emissions.
While this paper focuses on optimizing sensor placement for methane emission detection efficiency, the algorithm can be extended to various other applications, involving emission
localization and quantification, by simply changing the objective function in the optimization problem. This flexibility is due to the genetic algorithm’s ability to handle non-linear
objective functions, a capability not possible with the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) approach adopted in prior studies. 32,33
