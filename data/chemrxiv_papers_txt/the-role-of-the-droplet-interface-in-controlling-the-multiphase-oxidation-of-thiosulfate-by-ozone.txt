Abstract
Predicting reaction kinetics in
aqueous microdroplets, including
aerosols and cloud droplets, is
challenging due to the probability that
the underlying reaction mechanism
can occur both at the surface and in
the interior of the droplet. Here, we
use a stochastic reaction-diffusion
model of thiosulfate oxidation by gas
phase ozone to examine how the
interface influences the multiphase
reaction kinetics measured in levitated microdroplets using mass spectrometry. Building a realistic
kinetic model of multiphase reactions requires both a detailed multistep reaction mechanism as
well as the surface affinities of all reactants and products. Deep-UV Second Harmonic Generation
spectroscopy is used to probe surface affinities of thiosulfate, sulfate, and sulfite, key species in
the reaction mechanism. Thiosulfate has an appreciable surface affinity with a measured Gibbs
free energy of adsorption of -7.29 ± 2.47 kJ/mol in neutral solution, while sulfate and sulfite exhibit
negligible surface propensity. The Gibbs free energy is combined with data from liquid flat jet
ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to constrain the concentration of thiosulfate
at the surface in the kinetic model. Kinetic simulations show that the primary reaction between
thiosulfate and ozone occurs at the interface and in the bulk, with the contribution of the interface
decreasing from ~65% at pH 5 to ~45% at pH 13. Additionally, sulfate, the major product of
thiosulfate ozonation and an important species in atmospheric processes, can be produced by
two different pathways at pH 5, one with a contribution from the interface of >70% and the other
occurring predominantly in the bulk (>98%). Finally, we use the kinetic model to demonstrate the
impact of a range of atmospherically relevant droplet sizes and reactant concentrations on product
distributions and relative importances of surface and bulk chemistry. The observations in this work
have implications for mining wastewater remediation and are likely applicable to other
atmospherically-relevant reaction mechanisms, suggesting that future microdroplet/aerosol
chemistry studies should carefully consider the role of both interfacial and bulk chemistry.

1. Introduction
Chemistry in microdroplets has garnered interest in recent years for its (sometimes extreme)
differences from either purely gas-phase or condensed phase chemistry.1 Some studies have
shown that microdroplet reaction rates increase with decreasing droplet size and reactant
concentration, attributing this rate enhancement to high surface-to-volume ratios and increased
contributions to the reaction from droplet interfaces. However, there is debate regarding the
source of reaction rate enhancement,2-4 and determining the exact drivers in microdroplet
chemistry, including the individual contributions from surface and bulk phases, is notoriously
challenging due to experimental constraints and a lack of available surface activity data.
Chemistry in microdroplets, including aerosols and cloud droplets, has a crucial role in
atmospheric chemistry,5 hence a thorough understanding of microdroplet reaction mechanisms
will be vital for accurate atmospheric chemistry modeling.
The oxidation of sulfur and its impact on global climate has long been studied, but new sulfur
intermediates are still being identified6 and sulfur oxyanions like thiosulfate may be
underappreciated atmospheric intermediates. Thiosulfate might be released into the environment
from incompletely treated mining tailings or formed from H2S and SO2 in volcanic stratospheric
aerosols.7 Once released or formed, the ozonation of thiosulfate can acidify the reaction
environment and form a mixture of fully oxidized sulfur (sulfate, SO42-) and partially oxidized sulfur
(sulfur dioxide, SO2, trithionate, S3O62-, and tetrathionate, S4O62-). While sulfate directly
contributes to the global radiation budget through new particle formation, thiosulfate, SO2,
trithionate, and tetrathionate can act as long-lived metastable intermediates in the atmospheric
sulfur cycle with down-stream environmental effects. Despite these potential impacts, the
chemistry of thiosulfate in microdroplets has largely been unaccounted for in modeling the
atmospheric sulfur cycle, and few studies have directly addressed the aqueous surface activity of
sulfur oxyanions.

Efforts towards understanding the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate can also provide an excellent
model system for understanding complex multistep reaction kinetics in microdroplets. Thiosulfate
is often used as an O3 scavenger in laboratory uptake studies due to its fast reaction with ozone,8
and trapped droplet studies suggest that thiosulfate is relatively surface active.9 In fact, previous
work from Wilson and co-workers have shown that ozone reactions with organic and inorganic
species in aqueous microdroplets are mediated by the non-reactive partitioning and diffusion of
reactants, but many of these studies had undetectable products.10, 11 A detailed investigation of
the multiphase chemistry of thiosulfate in microdroplets can therefore add to this body of work by
exploring the role of the droplet surface for a reaction where the quantitative kinetics of
intermediates and products are measured.

Our previous study7 presented the ozone oxidation of thiosulfate in aqueous droplets as a
function of solution pH and gas-phase ozone concentration. This work prompted the formulation
of a new reaction mechanism, shown in Scheme 1, which incorporates a previously unobserved
intermediate, dithionite (S2O42-), as well as explains the pH-dependence of the reaction by a series
of elementary reaction steps, as described in Deal, et al.7 Briefly, the primary reaction between
thiosulfate and ozone forms an ozonide intermediate ([S2O3OOO]2-), which can decompose via

three different reaction steps to form sulfate (SO42-), sulfur dioxide (SO2), dithionite (S2O42-), and
dithionite’s conjugate acid (HS2O4-). S2O42- can then react with dissolved oxygen to form SO42and SO2 or react with SO2 to form trithionate (S3O62-). HS2O4- can react with another thiosulfate
molecule to form tetrathionate (S4O62-). Any SO2 produced can either desorb to the gas phase or
hydrolyze to form bisulfite (HSO3-) and sulfite (SO32-), which acidifies the solution. Lastly, SO32can be oxidized by ozone to form SO42-. In this mechanism, the pH of the solution has an explicit
role in the branching ratio of the three [S2O3OOO]2- decomposition pathways and controls the
acid-base equilibria for S2O42-/ HS2O4- and SO2/HSO3-/SO32-. A kinetic model using this proposed
mechanism was validated against prior literature experiments.9, 12
The kinetic model of the mechanism in Scheme 1 showed that accurate modeling of an
experiment requires a thorough understanding of partitioning, but few studies have directly
assessed the surface activity of thiosulfate or other intermediate sulfur oxyanions.7 Here, Deep
UV-Second Harmonic Generation (DUV-SHG) is used to determine the Gibbs free energy of
adsorption of thiosulfate, sulfate, and sulfite, and ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (APXPS) of a flat liquid micro-jet is used to determine the maximum surface
concentration of thiosulfate. There is a longstanding history of using nonlinear SHG
measurements to extract thermodynamic information about surface-active species.13-15 These
experiments help establish the molecular driving force for ions at the air-water interface when
combined with corroborating information, typically from molecular dynamics simulations. In this
work, we instead couple SHG studies with APXPS and kinetic experiments to assess the
macroscopic impact of ions partitioning to interfaces during multiphase reactions. We use our
kinetic models to test the Gibbs free energy of adsorption from SHG experiments and the
maximum surface concentration from APXPS experiments. Thus, we bridge surface-specific
(SHG and APXPS) and bulk (levitated microdroplet reactions) techniques to refine our
understanding of the surface activity of thiosulfate and the mechanism for ozone oxidation of
thiosulfate.

Finally, we use the kinetic model to explore the interaction between microscale reactors and
reaction kinetics using calculated surface reaction fractions and demonstrate the potential impacts
on product distributions for a range of environmentally relevant droplet sizes and reactant
concentrations.
2. Methods
2.1. Deep UV Second Harmonic Generation (DUV-SHG)
2.1.1. Experimental Methods
We directly probe the equilibrium constants for sulfur oxyanions at the air-water interface using
resonantly enhanced DUV-SHG spectroscopy. As a second-order nonlinear spectroscopy, DUVSHG is a surface-specific molecular probe that, in the electric dipole approximation, generates
signal from only the topmost molecular layers of the air-water interface. Since the full experimental
approach is described elsewhere,14, 16 only key details are provided here. The 800 nm output of a
Ti:Sapphire amplifier (Spectra Physics, Spitfire) is directed to an optical parametric amplifier
(TOPAS Prime) where the fundamental input wavelength is generated (386 – 440 nm). Solutions
of Na2S2O3 (Sigma Aldrich, Reddi-Dri 99%), Na2SO3 (Fisher, ≥98%), and Na2SO4 (Sigma Aldrich,
Reddi-Dri 99%) were made using ultrapure 18.2 MΩ water (Millipore, Milli-Q). The fundamental
was directed to solutions held in Petri dishes at an angle 60o relative to the solution surface normal.
DUV-SHG signal from the solution interface is spectrally filtered from the colinear fundamental
and detected by a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R7154PHA). Figure 1A depicts the
experimental setup and SHG process.

depiction of SHG produced at the air-water interface containing contributions from water molecules and
resonant thiosulfate anions. B) Energy-level diagram highlighting the nonlinear SHG parametric process.
The fundamental at 440 nm is two-photon resonant with the CTTS transition of thiosulfate. C) UV-Visible
spectra of aqueous sulfur oxyanions. The CTTS transition peaks of sulfite and thiosulfate are clearly visible
along with the low energy tail of the sulfate CTTS.

In DUV-SHG, two photons are simultaneously annihilated to generate a third photon at twice
the input frequency (Figure 1B). The input wavelength is chosen such that the second harmonic is
resonant with the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) transition of the anions for signal
enhancement. Much work has been done to characterize the energy and magnitude of CTTS
transitions of common ions, including the sulfur oxyanions studied here.17 Despite the broad
absorption features typical of these transitions, the center absorption wavelengths are well
separated for each of the three species studied here (Figure 1C) and therefore require different
input wavelengths.
2.1.2. Langmuir Adsorption Model of DUV-SHG Spectra
To characterize the propensity of ion adsorption to the air-water interface, DUV-SHG data are
fit to a Langmuir isotherm. Compared to other adsorption isotherms, a simple Langmuir model

best fits our concentration-dependent data. A full discussion on this Langmuir model and its
application to SHG data can be found elsewhere.14 Briefly, we assume molecules in the bulk
([𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑏) ], [𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑏) ]) are free to exchange position with molecules at the interface ([𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ],
[𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ]) and derive an equilibrium expression for ion adsorption. Our model assumes that there
is a maximum number of surface sites ( [𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠]𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) and we use the relation [𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠]𝑚𝑎𝑥 =
[𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ] + [𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ] to substitute for the interfacial water concentration:

2.2. Ambient Pressure Photoelectron Spectroscopy (APXPS)
We directly probe the surface concentration, [𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ], of thiosulfate given its known bulk
concentration, [𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑏) ], using APXPS on a flat liquid jet. APXPS measurements were conducted
at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at beamline 11.0.2.1 in the LARaXS endstation using a
colliding micro-liquid flat jet system, as described in Section S2.1 in the Supporting Information.
O 1s core level spectra were taken with varying excitation energies (Section S2.2 in Supporting
Information) to probe the first ~1.5 – 5 nm of the flat jet surface. Thiosulfate and water peak areas
were determined from the O 1s spectrum, which probes the first ~1.5 nm of the surface (i.e., the
O 1s spectrum taken with an excitation energy producing electrons with 100 eV excess kinetic
energy). These areas were used to calculate the concentration of adsorbed thiosulfate at a bulk

2.3. Kinetic Modeling of Thiosulfate Ozonation
A stochastic reaction diffusion model is implemented in Kinetiscope©, which has been used
to model kinetics in a variety of systems, including organic aerosol, aqueous microdroplets, and
emulsions.10, 11, 18, 19 The model used in this work was developed previously in Deal, et al.7 and
validated against experimental data, which is replicated here in Figure 3 and Figure 4. These
data7 were collected using levitated microdroplets that were trapped using a quadrupole
electrodynamic trap (QET), exposed to ozone, and ejected into an open-port sampling interface
(OPSI) for analysis by mass spectrometry (see Figure S12 in Supporting Information for an
experimental schematic). The droplets comprised a 0.25 M solution of sodium thiosulfate at pH 5,
9, or 13. Solutions at pH 5 and 9 were buffered using malonic acid and NaOH or glycine and HCl,
respectively. The pH 13 solution was adjusted using NaOH and was unbuffered due to a lack of
viable buffers in this pH range. Single droplets were ejected sequentially and their contents at
each time point were analyzed using OPSI-MS as described in Deal, et al.7, providing
concentrations of reactants, intermediates, and products over time. A kinetic model was
constructed based on the mechanism shown in Scheme 1, with reaction rate constants and
diffusion coefficients from the literature or benchmarked against the experimental data (see Table
S1 in Supporting Information). This kinetic model is the basis for many of the observations in this
paper and we thus describe the model in more detail here.
Kinetiscope© is a kinetic modeling software package that uses a Monte Carlo approach to
simulate chemical kinetics wherein probabilities for each reaction step are used to propagate
concentrations in time. To account for the multiphase nature of the droplet, the system is modeled
as two rectangular compartments: a surface compartment and a bulk compartment. The surface

compartment has a depth of 1 nm, representing the depth of favorable solvation of ozone as
determined by molecular dynamics simulations,10 and the bulk compartment has a length of r/3,
which preserves the correct surface-to-volume ratio of spherical droplets.20 Both surface and bulk
compartments have cross sections of 1 nm2. We note that the probing depth of the DUV-SHG is
a few molecules and APXPS is the first ~1.5 nm of the surface, but we model the depth of the
interface as 1 nm to represent the region where ozone is expected to have enhanced
concentration relative to the gas and bulk phases (see Supporting Information Figure S13). Using
a larger depth for the surface compartment would over predict the amount of adsorbed ozone and
inaccurately enhance thiosulfate decay.
When modeling ‘bulk-only’ chemistry and calculating surface reaction fractions, we add a third
‘reaction-diffusion’ compartment between the surface and bulk compartments, as described in
Section S1.2 in Supporting Information. While this three-compartment model provides more
detailed simulations, it is also computationally expensive and takes up to 24 hours to simulate
~500 seconds of reaction time, while the two-compartment model takes 15 minutes to simulate
~1,500 seconds of reaction time. Given that the two-compartment model adequately replicates
the kinetics simulated in three-compartments (see Section S1.3 in Supporting Information), the
two-compartment is used for all simulations unless noted otherwise.
2.3.1. Ozone Partitioning Scheme
In the model it is necessary to consider ozone in three separate regimes: gas, bulk, and at the
interface.11 For the interface, we use a previously published Langmuir adsorption framework21
wherein ozone adsorbs to a surface site from the gas or liquid phase via the equilibria shown as
steps S1 and S2 in Table S1 in Supporting Information. A ‘surface site’ is a portion of the interface
where an ozone molecule can adsorb, and the maximum concentration of surface sites in
volumetric units is related to the surface excess by

where 𝛤𝑂∞3 is the maximum 2D surface concentration and δ is the thickness of the interface being
simulated. To calculate 𝛤𝑂∞3 , we use the inverse of the molecular area of ozone calculated by
Vieceli, et al.22 (18.5 Å2 ). Note that although sites are not molecules, we use the units 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐 ·

To determine the relevant kinetic rates, we first decompose the dimensionless Henry’s law

𝑔𝑠

Prophet, et al.10 used 𝐻𝑐𝑐 = 9.3, which is computed from the maximum solvation free energy in
𝑔𝑠

the interfacial region. The simulation is not sensitive to this difference, but we believe that 𝐻𝑐𝑐 =
4.97 is a more realistic representation of O3 in the interfacial regime. Both Prophet, et al.10 and
𝑔𝑏

this work use 𝐻𝑐𝑐 = 0.1451, which is consistent with previous studies on ozone solvation in 1M
sodium chloride solutions.23, 24
The Henry’s Law equilibrium constants are related to kinetic parameters to describe
partitioning between the phases (adsorption/desorption between the gas-phase and interface and
solvation/desolvation between the interface and bulk liquid):11

This results in rates of adsorption to the interface from the gas-phase of 𝑘𝑎𝑑𝑠 =

1.2 𝑥 10−12 𝑐𝑚3 · 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐 −1 · 𝑠 −1 . These fast rates, in a stochastic simulation, often result in a rapid
‘shuttling’ of ozone back and forth between the gas-phase and interface, significantly lengthening
simulation times. Thus, most simulations were run with 100X slower rates; i.e., 𝑘𝑎𝑑𝑠 =
1.77 𝑥 10−13 𝑐𝑚3 · 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐 −1 · 𝑠 −1 and 𝑘𝑑𝑒𝑠 = 1.93 𝑥 108 𝑠 −1 . In both cases, ozone transfer happens
much faster than the reaction and using the slower adsorption and desorption rate constants does
not affect the overall reaction kinetics while dramatically decreasing computational time.
2.3.2. Aqueous Solute Partitioning Scheme
After diffusing into the surface compartment, solutes can adsorb to the interface using a
Langmuir framework, wherein the adsorption rate is proportional to the bulk concentration and
the concentration of available surface sites. Using thiosulfate as an example, surface-adsorbed
species at equilibrium are expressed as,

(see Section S3 in Supporting Information).
The surface affinities for other non-volatile intermediates and products are also not well known.
Therefore, we adopt a relative surface activity framework wherein the Langmuir equilibrium
coefficient for each species is set relative to that of thiosulfate. At least one molecular dynamics
study showed that sulfate is repelled from the interface,25 and DUV-SHG results shown in Figure
2 suggest sulfite would be similarly repelled from the interface. Thus, the Langmuir equilibrium
coefficients for sulfate and sulfite are set as one order of magnitude smaller than that for
thiosulfate. On the other hand, other species are likely to be at least as surface active as
thiosulfate, thus we set the Langmuir equilibrium coefficients for HS2O4-, S3O62-, and S4O62- equal
to that of thiosulfate. The remaining species, S2O42-, is assigned a Langmuir equilibrium coefficient
one order of magnitude larger than that of thiosulfate, which provided the best match between
simulations and experiments.7 The reverse rate constants, 𝑘𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 , are set to 1 x 103 s-1 for all
adsorbing species, as in Prophet, et al.10 This value is large enough such that the simulated
kinetics are not sensitive to changes in the magnitude of 𝑘𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 , but small enough to prevent
excessive computation time. The forward rate constants, 𝑘𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 , are calculated using Equation

We adopt a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism in the kinetic model, wherein molecules must
first adsorb to the interface before they can react in the surface compartment. The concentration
of adsorbed molecules is dictated by the molecule’s surface activity, determined by the maximum

information. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have measured either 𝛥𝐺𝑎𝑑𝑠 or
𝑎𝑑𝑠 for thiosulfate and the other sulfur oxyanions involved in the reaction mechanism shown in

Scheme 1. Here, we use Deep UV Second Harmonic Generation (DUV-SHG) to quantitatively
determine the adsorption energy for thiosulfate at pH 6 and pH 13 and qualitatively determine
sulfate and sulfite adsorption at pH 6.

Figure 2A plots the normalized SHG response of sulfite and sulfate as a function of bulk
concentration. Sulfate solutions exhibit a flat SHG response across the measured concentration
range, which is consistent with sulfate being repelled from the interface. As part of the Hoffmeister
series, sulfate is a known kosmotrope and several studies have found it is well-solvated in water
with no significant interfacial presence.26-29 Previous Raman thermometry measurements on 3 M
aqueous (NH4)2SO4 microdroplets observed no change in the evaporation rate relative to pure
water, which suggests that neither ammonium nor sulfate significantly impacted the exchange of

water molecules across the air-water interface.26 Additionally, recent phase-sensitive vibrationalSHG measurements observed minimal perturbation of the free O-H stretch band of interfacial
water molecules in MgSO4 and Na2SO4 solutions.27 It should be noted that our sulfate
measurements were made with the second harmonic ca. 20 nm away from the expected CTTS
transition maximum due to limitations in our optics and to avoid water molecule transitions.
However, we are still weakly resonant with the low energy tail of the CTTS as seen in Figure 1C,
SHG is sensitive enough to capture signal changes even under non-resonant conditions, and our
results agree with previous studies.30
Sodium sulfite measurements collected at 200 nm display a weak signal increase above 1 M
(Figure 2A). Previous SHG work has attributed this weak linear response to an interfacial
thickening of the water layer due to an increased solute concentration, which alters the
hyperpolarizability of interfacial water moleucles.16, 30, 31 Given the typical linewidth of CTTS
transitions, we measured sodium sulfite at 390 nm (195 nm SHG), and observe a clear uniform
response similar to sulfate measurements. If sulfite ions were indeed surface-active, a 5 nm shift
away from the resonant transition center would not completely diminish the SHG response.
Unlike sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite solutions, Figure 2B shows a strong concentration
dependent SHG signal for solutions of sodium thiosulfate. Fitting the normalized SHG response
to Equation 8, we extract 𝛥𝐺𝑎𝑑𝑠 = −7.29 ± 2.47𝑘𝐽/𝑚𝑜𝑙 for thiosulfate anions at the air-water
interface. These results indicate that thiosulfate, a doubly charged anion, exhibits a strong
propensity for the interface not seen in the similarly charged sulfite and sulfate anions. This
behavior is striking since early theories of ions at interfaces by Onsager and Samaras predict a
strong repulsion of doubly charged ions based on electrostatic arguments.32 Even as early
experimental and theoretical studies began to uncover support for interfacial ions, it was thought
that only large, highly polarizable anions could be surface enhanced and excluded multicharged
anions and cations. However, much progress has been made in our understanding of interfacial
ions and we now have evidence to support the surface enhancement of previously overlooked

ions. Recent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DUV-SHG studies find that the doublycharged carbonate ion similarly preferentially adsorbs to the air-water interface, much more
strongly than the singly charged bicarbonate ion.31, 33 MD simulations found that carbonate ions
form quasi-neutral clusters with surrounding water molecules and sodium counterions that is then
better accommodated at the interface. Similarly, recent studies indicate that like-charge ion pairing
is involved in the strong surface adsorption observed for guanidinium cations.16 While we do not
yet have a mechanism to explain the surface adsorption of thiosulfate, it is not unreasonable to
propose that favorable ion-pairing effects are likely involved. Without MD simulations, we lack a
theoretical route to validate and interpret the measured 𝛥𝐺𝑎𝑑𝑠 of thiosulfate, and instead use the
kinetic model to compare simulated reaction kinetics using the measured 𝛥𝐺𝑎𝑑𝑠 to experimental
reaction kinetics.
Specifically, Deal, et al.7 performed a sensitivity analysis comparing experimental data at each
pH to simulations assuming ΔGads = -4.82 kJ/mol, -7.29 kJ/mol, and -9.76 kJ/mol and found that
simulations assuming ΔGads = -7.29 kJ/mol were most consistent with the pH 5 and pH 9
experimental data while simulations assuming ΔGads = -4.82 kJ/mol were most consistent with the
pH 13 experimental data (see Figure S8 Supporting Information). This seems to suggest that
thiosulfate is less surface-active in this highly alkaline environment, thus we perform additional
DUV-SHG measurements of thiosulfate solutions adjusted to pH 13 (see Section S4 in Supporting
Information). The average ΔGads value at pH 13 is more positive (-4.08 ± 2.85 kJ/mol, Figure S8
in Supporting Information) than that for the neutral solution (-7.29 ± 2.47 kJ/mol, Figure 2Figure
3B), which may be consistent with a decreased surface activity at pH 13. However, the uncertainty
in these measurements remains large and the intensity of the SHG response is not significantly
different than the pH 6 measurements, which is inconsistent with decreased surface activity. Thus,
while our data suggest that the ΔGads of thiosulfate at the air-water interface could be less
favorable with increased pH, DUV-SHG results are inconclusive on their own (see Section S4 in
Supporting Information for more details).

3.1.2. Constraining [S2O32-(ads)] with DUV-SHG and APXPS
The concentration of adsorbed thiosulfate calculated by the kinetic model is dependent on
both the free energy of adsorption, as measured by DUV-SHG and discussed previously, as well
as the maximum concentration of adsorbed thiosulfate, [𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ]

were tested, namely [𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ]

from deprotonated forms in the mass spectra used in Deal, et al.7 The term ‘S loss’, or the total
amount of reacted sulfur that is not detected in products, encompasses all potential
unaccountable sulfur sinks, including evaporation as gasses, precipitation as elemental sulfur,
and experimental error.7

also shows excellent agreement with experimental data at pH 5 (Figure 3G) but overestimates

the amount of observed sulfate production at pH 9 (Figure 3H). This discrepancy at pH 9 is likely
due to the high sulfur loss (Figure 3B orange point), which the kinetic model does not account for.
Comparing the simulated and experimental results for dithionite and sulfite is more complicated
due to uncertainties in the concentrations for each of these species. Dithionite is not stable in
aqueous solution, where it decomposes into sulfite and sulfate,34 meaning that calibration curves
were not obtained for dithionite and the concentrations shown here are qualitative rather than
quantitative. Furthermore, because dithionite decomposes into sulfite, the experimental sulfite
signal at pH 9 (Figure 3E grey) may be skewed. Despite these issues, we find that the kinetic
simulations do accurately replicate the kinetic behavior of dithionite (Figure 3D,E,F green).
We note that although OH- is known to react with ozone, which could also explain the reduced
thiosulfate decay observed at pH 13, the rate constant (< 100 M-1 s-1 or < 2 x 10-19 cm3 molec-1 s1 35

)

is ~6 orders of magnitude smaller than the rate constant for the reaction of thiosulfate with

ozone (7.2 x 107 M-1 s-1 or 1.20 x 10-13 cm3 molec-1 s-1).36, 37 This means that almost all of the
thiosulfate has to be depleted before the OH- + O3 reaction becomes competitive. Given that we
still detect significant amounts of thiosulfate at long reaction times, we consider OH- + O3 as a
negligible contributor to the reaction kinetics. We also note that although we model the pH as the
same in the bulk and surface compartments, there is some evidence for enhanced acidity near
the interface.1 While it is possible our modeling of pH is too simplistic, enhanced acidity at the
interface likely does not explain the pH 13 kinetics as we would expect to see formation of
trithionate or tetrathionate. On the other hand, there is some evidence that anion reactions with
ozone are slower at the interface in highly alkaline environments.10
Overall, we find that the DUV-SHG and APXPS results are consistent with the experimental
results from Deal, et al.7, with all indicating that thiosulfate is surface active. Although there is
some uncertainty in the free energy of adsorption, and whether it changes with pH, the DUV-SHG
data show favorable free energies of adsorption to the interface in all cases. The APXPS results
also show a significant concentration of thiosulfate at the water surface, with maximum surface

concentrations of 1.33 M to 4 M. Simulations with this range of potential maximum surface
concentrations suggest that less thiosulfate adsorbs to the interface with increasing pH, which
may indicate competitive adsorption between thiosulfate and OH-, especially at pH 13 when [OH-]
= 0.1 M compared with [S2O32-] = 0.25 M. We note that APXPS measurements have only been
collected at neutral pH, and the exact mechanism for decreased thiosulfate surface concentration
with increasing pH remains to be determined. However, the general trend is consistent with
previous literature,10 and both experimental and simulated kinetics results show a fast reaction
with ozone which points towards a significant contribution from surface chemistry, regardless of
the exact concentration of thiosulfate.
3.2. Interface vs. Bulk Contributions to Reaction Kinetics
To examine the relative contribution of surface and bulk reactions, we run the kinetic model
allowing only surface or bulk chemistry, respectively. Given the findings in Section S.1., the kinetic
models use ΔGads = -4.82 kJ/mol for all pH values, but use [𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ]

𝑚𝑎𝑥

[𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ]

𝑚𝑎𝑥

= 2.67 M for pH 9, and [𝑆2 𝑂32−(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ]

𝑚𝑎𝑥

= 4.00 M for pH 5,

= 1.33 M for pH 13. ‘Bulk only’ simulations

require an additional reaction-diffusion compartment between the surface and bulk compartments
to account for near- surface reactions (see Supporting Information Section S1.2). In both ‘surface
only’ and ‘bulk only’ simulations, acid-base equilibria are still enforced throughout the simulation
volume and all species are allowed to adsorb to the interface, desorb from the interface, and
diffuse throughout the surface and bulk compartments. Simulations run with only surface
chemistry show significant thiosulfate decay (black dashed lines in Figure 4A,B,C), while modeling
only bulk chemistry (dotted lines) predicts a slower thiosulfate decay at pH 5 and pH 9.
At all pH values studied here, neither surface chemistry nor bulk chemistry alone recreate the
observed kinetics for reaction intermediates and final products (summarized in Table S3 in
Supporting Information). As shown by the dashed lines Figure 4D,E,F, restricting chemistry to the
surface does not accurately capture the decay kinetics for dithionite (S2O42-, green) and results in

negligible sulfite (SO32-, grey) formation. Note that although experimental results cannot
distinguish between S2O42- and its conjugate acid, HS2O4-, simulations suggest that [S2O42-] >>
[HS2O4-] at all pH values studied here. In Figure 4G,H,J, we see that restricting chemistry to the
surface compartment produces a negligible amount of the expected final products in pH 9 and pH
13 solutions (Figure 4H,J), and no tetrathionate (S4O62-, purple) and too much trithionate (S3O62-,
blue) in the pH 5 solution (Figure 4G). On the other hand, restricting chemistry to the bulk
compartment shows reasonable agreement with dithionite (S2O42-, green) kinetics (Figure 4D,E,F)
and reasonable agreement with the final concentrations of final products at pH 5 (Figure 4G) but
does not accurately capture the maximum dithionite concentration at pH 9 (Figure 4E), final
product kinetics at early times at pH 5 (Figure 4G), or trithionate (S3O62-, blue) production at pH 9
(Figure 4H). This suggests that the ozonation of thiosulfate in droplets formed from pH 5 and pH
9 solutions relies on both surface and bulk chemistry.

repeats. Simulation results include both surface and bulk reactions (solid lines), only surface
reactions (dashed lines), or only bulk reactions (dotted lines).
Thiosulfate decay kinetics appear decoupled from the kinetics of the reaction intermediates
and products, as mentioned in Deal, et al.7 and seen in Figure 4. This is especially clear for pH 5
and pH 9 solutions, wherein the thiosulfate decay kinetics (Figure 4A,B) can be described using
only surface reactions, but the kinetics of reaction intermediates (Figure 4D,E) and products
(Figure 4G,H) must be described using both surface and bulk reactions. To better understand this,
we examine the percent surface reaction for each reaction step using a 3-compartment model
(see Section S1.2. and S.1.3. in Supporting Information). Although computationally expensive, a
3-compartment model is used to prevent an artificial enhancement of the surface reaction fraction,

subsequent decomposition of the ozonide intermediate [S2O3OOO]- to form SO2 and sulfate,

decomposition of S2O42- to form SO2 and SO42- (reaction 2a in Figure 5C,E) and the reaction of
HS2O4- with thiosulfate to form S4O62- (reaction 2c in Figure 5C) occur primarily in the droplet bulk
𝑥
with 𝑓𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓
< 2%. Interestingly, the location of the S2O42- + SO2 reaction to form S3O62- (reaction 2b

in Figure 5B,E) is both pH and reaction time dependent. At pH 9, this reaction occurs mostly in

the droplet bulk with 𝑓𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓
~ 0% (Figure 5E), but at pH 5, this reaction occurs at the surface and
𝑥
in the bulk with 𝑓𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓
decreasing from ~35% to ~20% over 10 minutes (Figure 5B). Using this

information, we can overlay the reaction mechanism shown in Scheme 1 with the interface or bulk
reaction location and create a detailed reaction-diffusion mechanism as demonstrated in Figure
6.

Figure 6. Schematic of the interface-mediated reaction-diffusion mechanism for the ozonation of
thiosulfate in aqueous droplets at pH 5. Bolded species are detected by experiments7 and colors
are set to match those used in Scheme 1 and other figures in this work.
The combined role of pH and the interface in the production of sulfate, the main product, is
particularly interesting. Sulfate can either be formed by direct decomposition of the ozonide
intermediate, which primarily occurs at the interface (r1a in Figure 5A,D), or by the reaction of
S2O42- with O2, which primarily occurs in the bulk (r2a in Figure 5C,E). However, reaction 1a is pH
dependent, meaning that reaction 2a is the main sulfate formation pathway at pH 9 and pH 13.
Ultimately, sulfate will be formed mostly in the bulk at higher pH, but some will be formed at the
surface of the droplet at lower pH. Accurate accounting of sulfate is important for climate modeling

due to its hygroscopic nature and ability to form cloud condensation nuclei, meaning that such a
detailed analysis of sulfate formation in droplets may be useful to atmospheric scientists.
3.3. Reactant Concentration & Droplet Size Effects
Microdroplets in the atmosphere may be exposed to a range of gas-phase reactant
concentrations or have a variety of size distributions and solute concentrations. With this in mind,
we seek to address how aerosol/droplet size, thiosulfate concentration, and ozone concentration
affect the relative importance of the surface and bulk chemistry illustrated in Figure 6.
First, we compare our kinetic model with data published by Hsu, et al.9 which utilized smaller
droplets (~3 μm) and larger ranges of thiosulfate (2.86 to 10.1 M) and ozone concentrations (0.4
to 15 ppm). Hsu, et al.9 used optical tweezers to capture single droplets and Raman spectroscopy
to determine reactant and product concentrations. Droplets were unbuffered, and the pH likely
decreased from 7 at the start of the reaction to 1 or 2 at the end of the reaction. The kinetic model
used here assumes a fixed pH to reduce computation time and used pH = 7, which has been
accurate when modeling other unbuffered thiosulfate ozonation experiments.7 Despite this
assumption, our model adequately predicts the thiosulfate decay detected in some of the Hsu, et
al.9 experiments, as shown in Figure 7. We note, however, that our model does not explain all of
the Hsu, et al.9 data as shown in Section S6 in Supporting Information, especially at low ozone

concentrations where the thiosulfate decay rate decreases and experimental error increases
(Experiments 6-9 in Figure S9 and S10 in Supporting Information).

Figure 7. Select comparisons between the kinetic model (lines) and experimental data from Hsu,
et al.9 Data with error bars are recreated from ref 9. See Section S6 in Supporting Information for
all comparisons between model and experiments.
Next, we investigate a range of atmospherically relevant initial bulk thiosulfate concentrations,
gas-phase ozone concentrations, and droplet radii using the kinetic model described here. Note
that although most aerosols are very acidic (pH 1-3), our current kinetic model has not been
benchmarked against experiments at such low acidity. Additionally, there are some instances
where aerosols may reach pH 4-6, including over Hawaii, São Paulo, and mainland China.38 As
such, the simulations presented here use the pH 5 kinetic model to offer novel insights into the
ozonation of thiosulfate in acidic environments.

The droplet experiments presented in Deal, et al.7 were performed with an initial bulk
thiosulfate concentration of 250 mM, but thiosulfate concentrations in the natural environment are
likely very low (< 10 mM). Similarly, the experiments presented in Deal, et al.7 were performed
with gas-phase ozone concentrations between 1 and 6 ppm, but gas-phase ozone concentrations
in the natural environment are much lower (< 1 ppm). Here, we connect experiment and natural
environment concentration ranges by simulating droplet chemistry with [S2O32-]0 = 1, 10, 100, and
250 mM and [O3]gas = 0.1, 0.5, and 1 ppm. Atmospheric chemistry is most impacted by
aerosols/droplets with radii between 0.001 and 5 μm, but at sufficiently small droplet sizes (<
~0.01 μm), curvature can affect droplet chemistry due to the similarity between molecular and
droplet sizes. Given that our kinetic model does not account for droplet curvature, we simulate
droplets with r = 0.2 μm (which represents a maximum in the volume distribution for a typical
urban model aerosol39), 3 μm (representative of Hsu, et al.9), and 25 μm (representative of Deal,
et al.7). Sets of simulations were run with fixed thiosulfate concentration ([S2O32-]0 = 100 mM) or
fixed ozone concentration ([O3]gas = 1 ppm), and the concentrations of each product and the
percent surface reactions were calculated using the values after all thiosulfate was reacted. Note
that of the four products examined here, SO42-, S3O62-, and S4O62- were detectable in experiments
and SO2 was undetectable.7, 9 However, SO2 is likely a major source of the S loss noted in the
Deal, et al.7 experiments, Figure 3, and Figure 4, thus we model its production here. The % yield
for each product represents the total amount of reacted sulfur that is incorporated into the given
product, and the % surface reaction is calculated as described previously.
Figure 8 shows the impact of [S2O32-]0, [O3]gas, and aerosol size on the product distribution,
or % yield of each product, and relative importance of surface chemistry to bulk chemistry for a
given reaction, or the % surface reaction. Note that the results in Figure 8 were calculated with
the 2-compartment model described in Methods Section 2.3 to reduce computation time, and
results were checked against a 3-compartment model (see Section S9 in Supporting Information).
Although the 3-compartment model showed decreased % surface reaction values, the overall

trends with changes in [S2O32-]0, [O3]gas, and r remain constant, and there were negligible
differences in the calculated % yield.

Figure 8. Product distributions (A,B) and proportion of reactions occurring at the droplet surface
(C,D) for a range of gas-phase ozone concentrations ([O3]gas), initial bulk thiosulfate
concentrations ([S2O32-]0), and droplet radii. In A and C, the initial bulk thiosulfate concentration is
fixed at 100 mM, while the gas-phase ozone concentration and droplet radius are varied. In B and
D, the gas-phase ozone concentration is fixed at 1 ppm while the initial bulk thiosulfate
concentration and droplet radius are varied. Note: In A and B, SO42-, S3O62-, S4O62-, and SO2
products are indicated by red, blue, purple, and orange, respectively, to show the % yield of each
product. In C and D, S2O32- decay, SO42- production, and S3O62- production are indicated by grey,
red, and blue bars, respectively, with differences in shade according to droplet size as shown in
the legend. Simulations presented here are run with a 2-compartment model to reduce
computation time (see Methods Section 2.3. and Section S1.2. in Supporting Information). Select
simulations run with a 3-compartment model are shown for comparison in Section S9 in
Supporting Information.
Several observations can be drawn from Figure 8. First, changes in [O3]gas have minimal
impacts on the product distribution (Figure 8A) and relative importance of surface vs. bulk
chemistry (Figure 8C). In contrast, [S2O32-]0 has a significant effect on both product distributions
(Figure 8B) and surface vs bulk chemistry (Figure 8D). The difference in product distributions
28

shown in Figure 8B largely stems from the competition between SO2 evaporation (desorb in
Scheme 1) and the downstream reactions that form SO42-, S3O62-, and S4O62- (2a, 2b, and 2c in
Scheme 1 and Figure 6). Specifically, we see that as [S2O32-]0 increases, the % yield of S4O62- also
increases because its production requires two thiosulfate molecules, while the % yield of SO42and SO2 decreases. As [S2O32-]0 increases, more thiosulfate decay, SO42- production, and S3O62production occur at the surface (Figure 8D) due to the Langmuir adsorption of thiosulfate to the
interface. At higher bulk concentrations, more thiosulfate will adsorb to the interface, depleting a
significant portion of the adsorbed ozone before it can enter the droplet bulk. At lower thiosulfate
concentrations, which will have less adsorbed thiosulfate, less surface adsorbed ozone will be
reacted, allowing more ozone to enter the droplet bulk, thereby increasing the number of bulk
reactions and decreasing the relative importance of surface reactions.
Finally, we examine the role of droplet size in relationship to the reacto-diffusive length, l. The
reacto-diffusive length is calculated as:
𝐷𝑂

𝑙 = √𝑘·[𝑆 𝑂32− ],
2 3(b)

(16)

where 𝐷𝑂3 is the diffusion coefficient for ozone and k is the rate constant for the reaction between
ozone and thiosulfate (see Section S1 in Supporting Information for these values). For the bulk
thiosulfate concentrations tested here (1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM, 250 mM), we calculate reactodiffusive lengths of approximately 150nm, 50 nm, 15 nm, and 10 nm, respectively.
For a given [O3]gas and [S2O32-]0, increasing droplet size increases the % surface reaction for
S2O32- decay and decreases the % surface reaction for S3O62- production (gray and blue in Figure
8C,D). In larger droplets, where the radius is much larger than the reacto-diffusive length, bulk
chemistry is limited by diffusion, resulting in ozonation reactions occurring mostly at the surface.
In smaller droplets, the radius of the droplet nears the reacto-diffusive length, approaching phase
mixing where ozone diffusion no longer limits bulk phase reactions. This also leads to differences
in product distributions due to the phase dependent competition of downstream reaction steps,

as shown in Figure 6. Generally, for a given [O3]gas and [S2O32-]0, the % yields of SO42- and SO2
increase with increasing droplet size, while the relationships between droplet size and the %
yields of S3O62- or S4O62- are more complicated (Figure 8A,B).
Droplet size and [S2O32-]0 effects on product distributions are particularly interesting when
considering the impacts on the overall oxidation state of sulfur, as shown in Figure 9. S2O32- has
an average oxidation state of 2, while the major products have a variety of oxidation states. SO42has an oxidation state of 6, SO2 has an oxidation state of 4, S3O62- has an average oxidation state
of 3.3, and S4O62- has an average oxidation state of 2.5. This means that reaction environments
that favor S3O62- and/or S4O62- will, on average, produce less oxidized sulfur than reaction
environments that favor SO2 and/or SO42-. Among the test environments simulated here, the
smallest droplets (r = 0.2 μm) with the lowest [S2O32-]0 (1 mM) produce the most sulfate and SO2,
resulting in the highest average oxidation state at reaction completion (4.74). This is in contrast
with midsize droplets (r = 3 μm) with the highest [S2O32-]0 (250 mM), which produce the most
S4O62-, resulting in the lowest average oxidation state at reaction completion (3.99).

Figure 9. Average sulfur oxidation state for a range of gas-phase ozone concentrations, [O3]gas,
(A), initial bulk thiosulfate concentrations ([S2O32-]0), (B) and droplet radii (indicated across the top
of each panel. Note: The average oxidation state is broken down into contributions from each
product. Contributions from SO42-, S3O62-, S4O62-, and SO2 are indicated by red, blue, purple, and
orange, respectively.
The average sulfur oxidation state is a function of the product distribution, which will be
determined by a combination of droplet size and thiosulfate concentration, primarily due to an

interface-mediated competition between SO42- and S4O62- production. As depicted in Figure 6,
S4O62- production requires the reaction of thiosulfate with ozone, which primarily occurs at the
surface, followed by the secondary reaction of HS2O4- with another thiosulfate molecule, which
primarily occurs in the bulk. In contrast, SO42- production occurs by two different pathways, at the
interface or in bulk. Given this complex role of the droplet interface in controlling individual reaction
steps, it is unsurprising that the product distribution, and thus the overall oxidation state, is a
complex function of thiosulfate concentration and droplet size. Regardless of the exact
mechanistic differences that drive this outcome, this example demonstrates the multiphase
control of the thiosulfate ozonation reaction mechanism.

4. Conclusions
One of the key challenges when investigating multiphase chemistry is connecting molecularlevel detail to macroscale reactivity in different phases. Here, we use DUV-SHG, which provides
information about the first few layers of molecules at an aqueous surface, APXPS, which provides
information from about the first ~1.5 to 5 nm at an aqueous surface, and reaction kinetics in
trapped droplets, which provides information about reactivity across the interface and bulk. These
three techniques, representing vastly different length scales, are combined using stochastic
kinetic modeling via Kinetiscope©. The resultant kinetic model is used to explore the relationship
between a complex reaction mechanism, the ozonation of thiosulfate, and the multiphase nature
of the droplet reactor. Specifically, we find that individual reaction steps tend to occur throughout
smaller droplets, where the reacto-diffusive length nears the droplet radius, while individual
reaction steps become separated in larger droplets, where the reacto-diffusive length is much
smaller than the droplet radius. Specifically, primary reaction steps typically occur more often at
the interface than in the bulk, while some downstream reaction steps occur predominantly in the
bulk. We also find that the product distribution, and thus the average sulfur oxidation state, is
dependent on a non-trivial combination of droplet size and reactant concentration.

S2O32- has two sulfurs with an average oxidation state of +2, while its ozonation products have
a range of oxidation states. Fully oxidized sulfur (S+6) in the form of sulfate attracts water,
increasing the size of the aerosol/droplet or forming cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), directly
affecting radiative forcing. While we show that most sulfate will be formed in the bulk of the droplet,
in more acidic conditions some sulfate will be formed at the surface of the droplet, potentially
increasing the likelihood that it can impact the surrounding environment. On the other hand, SO2,
S3O62-, and S4O62- are incompletely oxidized with average sulfur oxidation states of +4, +3.3, and
+2.5, respectively. The incompletely oxidized sulfur in these stable intermediates remains
susceptible to further oxidation in large bodies of water or atmospheric aerosols/droplets, which
typically also results in downstream acidification.
Recent efforts have suggested using ozone-microbubbles for mining wastewater remediation
including thiosalt removal. This study shows that these processes should consider the size and
pH of bubbles to ensure maximum sulfur oxidation and prevent downstream acidification of the
natural environment. Additionally, the sulfur cycle, and specifically the oxidation state of sulfur,
can have a large impact on the global radiation budget. Atmospheric chemistry models thus
require a thorough understanding of sulfur chemistry to predict CCN formation and aerosol/droplet
acidification. This study begins to address the relevant parameters for thorough modeling of
potential thiosulfate ozonation occurring in the atmosphere. Similar studies addressing the
multiphase chemistry in droplet reactors for other environmentally relevant reaction mechanisms
can be used to obtain a more detailed understanding of atmospheric chemistry involving droplets
and aerosols.
