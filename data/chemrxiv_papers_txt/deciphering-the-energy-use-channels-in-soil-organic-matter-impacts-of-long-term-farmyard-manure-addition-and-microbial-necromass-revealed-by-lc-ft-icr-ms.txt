Abstract
Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in the global carbon cycle and contributes to storage of
C and energy in soils. Farmyard manure (FYM) addition to arable soils is a measure to increase SOM
content, microbial activity and abundance of microbial metabolites (e.g., necromass (NM) markers).
However, understanding the mechanistic links between soil dynamics and energy storage is hampered
due to the chemical complexity of SOM. Non-targeted molecular-level methods like liquid
chromatography coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FT-ICRMS) can be used to explore the complex dynamics of SOM, revealing energetic fingerprints and longterm changes in SOM due to FYM addition. We compared water-extractable organic matter (WEOM)
from soils of four long-term FYM addition experiments with representative WEOM signatures from
maize, bacterial and fungal NM. Long-term FYM addition increased the complexity of WEOM, most
pronounced in polar, unsaturated, oxidised and energy-poor compounds. These changes were linked to
a 2-3-fold increase in bacterial, plant and fungal NM signatures. Especially bacterial NM in FYMamended WEOM indicated a shift in dominant energy use channels. Control soils showed a much lower
overlap with all NMs, but indicated a higher dominance of fungal energy-use channels, especially for
N-containing compounds. A large fraction of WEOM signals (79% in FYM-amended, 94% in control

soils) was unrelated to any of the three NM signatures, and was also mainly responsible for the shift in
nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) between the fertilisation treatments. LC-FT-ICR-MS
provided access to ~600 novel microbial NM markers which are readily soluble and compositionally
distinct from classical NM markers (ergosterol, aminosugars, etc.). Overall, we highlight novel insights
into NM contribution to SOM by LC-FT-ICR-MS, and how it can assist to constrain compositional and
energetic impacts of FYM addition on soils.

Water-extractable organic matter became more soluble, oxidized and chemically complex after
FYM treatment
Farmyard manure addition led to an increased imprint of necromass markers in soil WEOM
Bacterial imprints increased over fungal ones, suggesting changes in C, N and energy use
channels
Lower energetic potential of soil WEOM was explained by compounds unrelated to
necromasses, indicating potential priming
LC-FT-ICR-MS provided access to 600 novel, readily soluble bacterial and fungal necromass
markers

There is a growing interest in the origins and energetic properties of stable soil organic carbon (SOC).
This interest comes from the crucial role that SOC plays in soil ecology, providing important ecosystem
services such as soil fertility, water quality, resistance to erosion, and climate mitigation (Kögel-Knabner
and Rumpel, 2018). Understanding the dynamics of stable SOC has therefore become paramount in
addressing global change (Schmidt et al., 2011) since global soils contain 3000 Pg and therefore more
organic C than present in the atmosphere as CO2 or as organic C in biomass (Tarnocai et al., 2009;
Schmidt et al., 2011). Our understanding of SOC dynamics is represented by models that presume
distinct C pools cycling fast or slow, but only partly reflect the complex mixture referred to as soil
organic matter (SOM) (Schmidt et al., 2011; Lehmann and Kleber, 2015). Recent studies soggest that
stable SOM formation is tied to the metabolic activities of microorganisms, giving rise to a diverse array
of compounds, including microbial necromass (NM) and plant-derived, microbially processed
compounds which may hold clues of active C and energy use channels (Guggenberger et al., 1999;
Kögel-Knabner, 2002; Miltner et al., 2012). Models assign a large fraction of microbial NM to stable
SOM now (Malik et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2019). This is supported by studies using
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Simpson et al., 2007), stoichiometric properties (Del Giorgio
and Cole, 1998), amino sugars (Fan and Liang, 2015), turnover of microbial proteins and cell structures
(Schweigert et al., 2015), and contribution of microbial products to stable SOM (Kästner and Miltner,
2018; T. Ma et al., 2018). Next to microbial (exo)metabolites, also microbial NM (e.g., colloidal proteins
or ribosomes) contributes to the water-extractable fraction of SOM (WEOM). This fraction is deemed
the most active and biologically-accessible component of SOM (Ma et al., 2020). WEOM therefore is a
mirror of microbial activity, and linked to primary and secondary metabolites such as carbohydrates,
amino acids, nucleosides, sterols, arenes, amines, and many other, yet unidentified molecules (Schmidt
et al., 2011). Due to its intermediate position between biochemically recognizable compound classes
and their mineralization products (CO2, H2O, etc.), it can potentially serve to improve our understanding

Global agriculture produces nearly seven billion tons of farmyard manure (FYM) annually (Thangarajan
et al., 2013). The application of FYM increases SOC and nutrient contents and has been reported to also
increase microbial activity, microbial metabolite abundances, and amounts of extractable SOC . The
increase in C storage has been assigned to more NM formation due to better access to labile substrates
and nutrients (Chang et al., 2007; Maillard and Angers, 2014). The mechanism by which the increased
microbial activity affects the composition of WEOM and SOM stabilization in general remains unclear
due to the largely unknown identity of most molecules in soils and NM. Metabolomic techniques have
been applied to resolve these molecular imprints and are deemed promising to provide mechanistic
understanding of molecular-level foundations of biogeochemical processes like C and nutrient cycling,
or novel measures to evaluate soil health (Brown et al., 2024). These metabolomics studies could also
provide information of changes to the energetic potential of WEOM (via nominal state of oxidation of
C, NOSC which is empirical correlated with Gibbs free energy), and by comparison with NM markers,
could reveal causal links between WEOM properties and active C and energy use channels (LaRowe
and Van Cappellen, 2011; Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2022). Chromatographic techniques coupled to mass
spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS), for example, allow to identify molecules via libraries of known
compounds, but a majority of the information is left unassigned (Swenson et al., 2015; Brailsford et al.,
2019; Brown et al., 2021).

Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) allows for the assignment of molecular formulas independent of libraries
due to its unmatched mass precision and resolving power, and can be coupled to LC systems (Bahureksa
et al., 2021; Lohse et al., 2021). Due to its analytical performance, it could complement existing
metabolomic techniques that rely on library identification and are targeted at known compound classes
(e.g., amino sugars, peptides, or biomarkers in general). FT-ICR-MS techniques have been employed
successfully to study SOM extracts by direct injection (Tfaily et al., 2015; Guigue et al., 2016; Roth et
al., 2019; Lohse et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). The two main drawbacks of this approach are the often
necessary preconcentration step performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE), which typically suffers
from uncomplete recovery (losses of highly polar compounds (Raeke et al., 2016)), and the missing
confidence in the structural identity of matching NM and SOM markers, as they are only identified via
molecular formula (i.e., exact mass). The coupling of FT-ICR-MS with LC is therefore promising as it
avoids SPE, i.e., allows on-line separation of salts from organic molecules, and increases sensitivity and
isomeric resolution (Jennings et al., 2022; Lechtenfeld et al., 2024). Using LC-FT-ICR-MS for WEOM
analysis will be likely result in identifying a broader spectrum of molecules resulting in a higher
confidence of NM assignment (i.e., distinction from other WEOM molecules) due of the added polarity
information. While WEOM is typically measured in negative ESI mode due to abundant carboxylic acid
groups, N-rich metabolites are usually missed but can be selectively detected by also employing positive
ESI mode (Ohno et al., 2014). The method therefore is appropriate to complement existing targeted
approaches, and may provide novel insights to decipher the links between microbes and WEOM
compositional changes upon long-term FYM addition.

To 1) identify NM markers in WEOM and to 2) compare NM marker contribution between FYM
receiving soils and controls, we employed a state-of-the-art LC-FT-ICR-MS method and compared
WEOM from soils and NM samples. We analysed WEOM from FYM-receiving soils (FYM) and
control soils being unfertilized (UF = nil fertilization), as well as necromass (NM) extracts derived from
plant litter (PNM, Zea mays), bacteria (BNM, Bacillus subtilis), and fungi (FNM, Aspergillus niger).
We chose to use both electrospray polarity modes to detect acidic as well as basic compounds (Hertkorn
et al., 2008; Han et al., 2021). Our main hypothesis was that FYM-receiving soils would show markedly

different molecular properties, regarding molecular composition and NOSC of the extractable
compounds. Further we hypothesised that these differences in energy and structure would be explained
through higher contributions of yet unknown plant, bacterial and fungal NM markers, which would
provide clues on the impacts of FYM addition, and the role of soil microbes as important drivers of
FYM and SOM turnover.

We show the distinct impacts of long-term FYM addition on WEOM regarding its NOSC, polarity,
saturation, nitrogen and oxygen content, molecular size and overall complexity. We expected that
increased contributions of NM would relate to these observed differences in WEOM character. The NM
signatures are then used to reveal the relative importance of different WEOM sources, according to their
share in ion abundance, which we refer to as “imprint”. Our findings offer a novel molecular perspective
on the roles of microbial, fungal and plant-derived compounds and their contribution to long-term SOM
formation and changes.

Substrates and soil samples

Soil samples were taken from four long-term field experiments: Dikopshof (University of Bonn,
Germany, established 1904), Reckenholz (ZOFE, Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland, established 1949),
Thyrow (Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany, established 1937) and QualiAgro (INRAe, Orgeval,
France, established 1998) (Table S1). From all four field trials samples were taken from plots that
continuously receiving farmyard manure (“FYM”) and control plots (“UF”, plots receiving nil fertilizer
but else treated similarly). Samples were taken in 2020 from 2-20 cm depth. The measured necromass
(NM) samples were bacterial necromass (Bacillus subtilis, BNM), fungal necromass (Aspergillus niger,
FNM) and plant necromass (Zea mays, PNM). FNM was purchased (Isolife, Wageningen, Netherlands).
PNM was produced by growing the variety “Yukon Chief” in hydroponic pots with a modified Hoagland
nutrient solution at a temperature of 20°C in a greenhouse at Max Planck institute for Biogeochemistry
in Jena Germany. The plants were harvested after cob formation and aboveground plant parts were
separated, cut, freeze dried and milled. BNM was produced by ultrasonically disintegrating Bacillus
subtilis DSM 10 cells. Briefly, B. subtilis was grown aerobically at 30.0±0.003 °C in a 1.5-liter
bioreactor (RC1e (Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland) in fed-batch mode on a mineral medium
with glucose as the sole C and energy source. The usage of the bioreactor allowed growth to a high cell
density. When the culture volume reached 1.5 L, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 g
and 4°C for 20 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting biomass was freeze-dried.

2.2.

Extraction of necromass and soil samples

All aqueous extracts were obtained by suspending 1 g of dry sample in 10 ml of ultra-pure water (MQW;
Merck Milli-Q, Darmstadt, Germany). Suspensions were shaken for 24h followed by centrifugation
(4500 g for 20 min, Beckman Coulter, United States) and filtration (0.2 μm, regenerated cellulose,
LABSOLUTE). The filtrate was used for further analysis. In the following, WEOM refers to the aqueous
extracts of the field trials, while necromass extracts refers to the aqueous extract of the microbial
necromass samples. Water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) was determined with a Dimatoc 2100
(Dimatec, Essen, Germany) system as non-purgeable organic carbon by near–IR absorption after high
temperature catalytic oxidation according to EN 1484. Five ml of each sample were acidified with 2 μl
of 37% HCl (p.A., CHEMSOLUTE) to remove inorganic C before NPOC analysis. The concentrations
and extraction yield of samples are provided in the supplement (Table S1).

diode array detector (DAD-3000RS) was used. A reversed phase polar end-capped C18 column
(ACQUITY HSS T3, 1.8 μm, 100 Å, 150 × 3 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a guard column
(ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 VanGuard, 100 Å, 1.8 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm) was used for chromatographic
separation. Ultra-pure water and LC-MS-grade methanol (MeOH; Biosolve, Valkenswaard,
Netherlands) were used as mobile phases A and B, respectively. 0.1% formic acid (FA) was added to
both eluents. A second LC pump (LPG-3400SD) was used to add a post column flow (0.2 mL/min). A
gradient was applied as to reverse the gradient of the first pump at the column outlet using the same
solvents (A: MeOH, B: MQW). The combined flow (50% MQW, 50% MeOH) was separated between
the mass spectrometer (0.1 mL/min) and DAD (0.3 mL/min, 210-280 nm) using an adjustable flow
splitter (ERC, Germany) (information about gradient and counter gradient found in Han et al., 2021).
Filtered WEOM-extracts were diluted to 10 mg-OC/L, and 100 µl of the diluted extracts was injected
into the UHPLC system.

FT-ICR-MS

An FT-ICR-MS equipped with a dynamically harmonized analyser cell (solariX XR, Bruker Daltonics
Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) and a 12 T refrigerated actively shielded superconducting magnet (Bruker
Biospin, Wissembourg, France) was used. The electrospray ionization source (Apollo II, Bruker
Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) was operated in negative (neg) or positive (pos) mode (capillary
voltage: 4.3 kV (neg) or -4.3 kV (pos), nebulizer gas pressure: 1.0 bar, dry gas temperature: 250 °C, dry
gas flow rate: 8.0 L/min), and each sample was measured in both modes separately. Mass spectra for
LC-MS measurements were acquired in broadband excitation mode and detected in the range m/z 147.41
- 1000 with a transient size of 4M (∼1.86s FID) and full profile, magnitude mode. Each sample and
polarity were measured as duplicate.

2.5.

FT-ICR-MS data processing

LC-MS data was split into eleven one-min wide retention time (RT) segments between 17 and 28 min
and all scans in each segment were averaged. This retention time span was selected because it showed
the largest overlap between positive and negative mode, across all samples. Peak picking signal to noise
(S/N) threshold was 4 in each segment. Each resulting mass spectrum was internally recalibrated with a
list of ubiquitous, known signals between 150−1000 m/z. Mass spectral calibration of segments was
done with DataAnalysis 5.0 (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). Molecular formulas (MFs)
were assigned to mass peaks in the m/z range 150−1000 using the n in-house software Lambda-Miner
(Wurz et al., 2024), allowing for a maximum mass error of ±0.5 ppm and the following elemental ranges:
C1−60, 13C0−1, H1−122, O0−40, N0−2, S0−1, 34S0−1. Additional filters were applied to the calculated MFs: 0.3 <
H/C < 2.5, 0 < O/ C < 1, 0 < N/C < 1.5, 0 < DBE < 25 (double bond equivalent, DBE = 1 + 1/2 [2C −
H+N]), −10 < DBE-O < 10 and element probability rules (Kind and Fiehn, 2007; Herzsprung et al.,
2014; Koch et al., 2014). MFs assigned to peaks in MQW injections were removed from each segment.
Duplicate sample injections were averaged and only MFs kept that occurred in both replicates. This
procedure was done for both ionisation modes separately, and the data from both modes was then
combined (union) for further analysis. To obtain the MFs that occur uniquely in UF extracts, data from
all field-trial sites was pooled, and a first Venn analysis was conducted to define sets of MFs for each
RT segment occurring only in UF or FYM samples (unique) or both (shared). Only the MFs unique to
UF or FYM in each segment was considered informative to reveal differences between treatments
(Figure 1). A second Venn analysis was then conducted to reveal the overlap of unique FYM and UF
signatures with those of NM extracts (BNM, FNM and PNM; Figure 1). Only the shared MFs were
considered informative for the further analysis. Markers that were found to overlap with soil WEOM
and were also found in more than two (i.e., two or three) NM extracts were grouped as an own category
(uNM). This category is used to indicate generic NM contribution.

Differences in polarity, complexity and composition of WEOM

Farmyard manure-receiving (FYM) and control (UF) soils showed distinct WEOM molecular and
polarity patterns according to LC-FT-ICR-MS analysis (individual chromatograms are shown in the
supplementary information Figure S1 – S11). The summed intensity of all MFs per RT segment showed
a similar increase in intensity from smaller to higher retention time and peaked at 24 – 27 minutes, but
the overall intensity was always 1.5 to 2-fold higher for FYM than for UF (Figure 2a) despite the same
amount of injected OC. The higher intensity of FYM extracts corresponded to the larger number of
assigned unique MFs across all RT segments as compared to UF extracts (29242 vs. 5580; 57 vs. 11%
of all MFs in each treatments) and especially increased in the time range 17 – 24 min (Figure 2b). 16977
MFs were shared between both treatments (Figure 2a).

To further explore the molecular differences between MFs unique to FYM and UF, we compared the
intensity weighted-averages of atomic ratios (O/C, H/C, N/C), the nominal oxidation state of carbon
(NOSC), the double bond equivalents (DBE) and molecular weight for each segment across the observed
polarity range (Figure 3 and Figure S12). In general, reversed-phase LC separation led to clear continua
in all of the above molecular descriptors for each sample. Upon comparison of the treatments, we found
a pronounced shift to higher NOSC, higher O/C and lower H/C across virtually all RT segments in
WEOM from the FYM treatment (Figure 3). Other molecular descriptors indicated small, but specific
differences. For example, N/C was consistently higher in FYM only in the first three RT segments
(highly polar material), along with a tendency to lower average molecular mass (Figure S12a, c), while
DBE was consistently higher in FYM samples only in the mid-polarity range (Figure S12b). All in all,
compositional differences between WEOM samples were consistent across the whole polarity range,
but not statistically significant (Figure S13). The clear shift in virtually all polarity segments indicates
that WEOM from FYM soils is more oxidized and less saturated, resulting in higher NOSC values. The
molecular variability was highest in FYM extracts and earlier-eluting material (Figure 3). Differences
between treatments were also most obvious in the early-eluting RT segments (more polar WEOM). In
contrast, later eluting (less polar, more reduced) compounds indicated less differences between
treatments.

Molecular composition of BNM, FNM and PNM

We also characterised bacterial, fungal, and plant necromass extracts regarding unique MFs (BNM,
FNM and PNM) and shared MFs (uNM) according to H/C ratio, O/C ratio, N/C ratio, DBE, molecular
mass and NOSC for each RT segment (Figure S14). FNM and BNM appeared more similar compared
to PNM and differed most in polar unsaturated compounds (high DBE values in early RT segments
Figure S14e) and polar higher-mass compounds (Figure S14f). BNM and FNM showed equal patterns
in N/C-ratio, NOSC and O/C-ratio (Figure S14a-d). In contrast, PNM showed compounds with smaller
N/C-ratio compared to FNM and BNM, especially in the later RT segments (Figure S14c), more reduced
polar and more oxidised nonpolar MFs than BNM and FNM (Figure S14d) and more polar oxygencontaining compounds than BNM and FNM (Figure S14a) that were also more saturated (Figure S15b).
Those differences were also apparent in the PCA (Figure S15) and all NMs were mainly divided by
NOSC, O/C ratio, N/C ratio and DBE. This clear division between NM samples according to measured
molecular descriptors is visible within the PCA as dimension 1 separates uNM from all other specific
NM types and dimension 2 separates PNM, BNM and FNM from each other. Overall, based on detailed
LC-FT-ICR-MS analysis, FNM and BNM were more similar in composition with PNM, differing
mainly in saturation, but showed very similar N/C ratios (high) and NOSC (low). PNM was distinctly
more oxidised and contained more saturated compounds as compared to FNM and BNM. Shared NM
markers (here called “uNM”, found in at least two NM extracts) showed especially high N/C ratios in
earlier RT segments and an increase in mass towards later RT segments; this group of markers was also
especially low in DBE across the whole polarity gradient (Figure S14).

3.3.

Imprints of necromass in SOM extracts related to FYM addition

In the next step, we characterised those NM markers also detected by exact mass (molecular formula)
and RT segment in WEOM (“overlap” in MFs). To visualise the impact of NM markers as defined by
our two-step Venn analysis (Fig. 1), we displayed their intensity share (in %) in WEOM according to
RT segment, and for UF and FYM soils separately (Figure 4a). We found a larger overlap of NM
markers with FYM WEOM throughout the entire polarity gradient and for all NM types. Shared NM
markers between NM types (uNM) showed high overlap in early and late RT segments, and in UF soil
WEOM only in later RT segments. Especially PNM and BNM showed a higher overlap (intensity-wise)
with FYM WEOM, while FNM showed higher overlap with UF extracts in later RT segments. PNM
showed overlap with all soil WEOM, but in FYM extracts this occurred throughout the whole polarity
gradient, accounting for 5%-10% of the total intensity in 10 out of 11 RT segments (Figure 4 a). In
contrast, a high PNM imprint (5-10%) was confined to only two later time windows in UF extracts. The
BNM imprint accounted for 5-15% in 4 out of 11 RT segments in FYM extracts, while it was below 5%
within the entire retention time span for UF extracts. Lastly, we found that the FNM imprint was between
4% and 8% for 4 out of 11 RT segments in UF extracts. All in all, our data show a much larger and more
variable imprint of necromass signatures in FYM-receiving soils. Importantly, a major fraction of
intensity remained unexplained, i.e., showed no overlap with any of the NM markers, even after
consideration of shared (uNM) markers (75% - 90% for FYM and 90-95% for UF) (Figure 4b).

In terms of formula classes (using heteroatom information, i.e., containing N or S atoms), the CHNO
formula class showed the highest contribution of NM-derived MFs in both treatments, but some shared
(uNM) and S-containing markers were also abundant (Fig. 4c). Fungal NM markers had the highest
impact on the measured intensity of MFs classified as CHNO (20% for FYM and 24% for UF). In
WEOM of UF soils, we found no substantial contribution of any NM and formula class despite FNM/
CHNO, i.e, all remaining contributions accounted for less than 4% of intensity. Therefore, the change
compared to FYM soil WEOM, in which BNM and PNM also contribute to a high degree to CHNO
formula classes (16% BNM and 14% PNM) indicated a distinct difference in composition between the
treatments. The contribution of NM markers to specific formula classes indicated a shift towards BNM
and PNM contributions in FYM soil WEOM extracts compared to those of UF soils, especially for the
CHNO formula class. Other formula classes showed higher PNM contribution in FYM-amended soil
WEOM. A fraction of late-eluting CHOS MFs shared between NM types (uNM) was elevated in both
treatments; in FYM-amended soil WEOM extracts, also unique BNM contributions were more apparent.

Averaged molecular descriptors of NM markers in WEOM samples were visualized to estimate the
impact of NM to the molecular-level differences between treatments, specifically of NOSC (Fig. 5a).
Four observations were made: 1) The H/C ratio was consistently higher for all marker categories (unique
NM markers: BNM, FNM, PNM, shared NM markers: uNM, unexplained MFs: SOM) in UF WEOM
as compared to FYM-amended WEOM (Figure 5a); 2) FYM WEOM had consistently higher NOSC
values as compared to UF treatments and differed most for PNM and uNM markers (Figure 5a); 3)
Considering these changes in NOSC and the intensity share of each category, the influence on NOSC
across the entire polarity spectrum was mainly explained by compounds in WEOM that showed no

overlap with NM signatures (Figure 5b), and 4) The observed shift in NOSC was mainly linked to the
contribution of highly polar compounds in earlier segments (17-21 min). BNM and FNM showed a
slight influence on NOSC in FYM samples (Figure 5b) and the overall shift in NOSC compared to UF
WEOM, but this was confined to the early RT segments and comparably small (Figure 5 c).

Effects of long-term FYM addition on WEOM molecular properties

It is known that FYM addition increases SOC stocks, the amount of extractable SOC, microbial activity
as well as microbial biomass (Q. Ma et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020). The increase in SOC results in greater
amounts of microbial NM that contribute to SOC. Bacterial NM accounts for approximately half of SOC
within croplands (Wang et al., 2021). Given the more reduced state of bacterial NM, one would expect
that long-term FYM addition also leads to a more reduced (i.e., energy-rich) SOM, and hence WEOM
(Tang et al., 2023). Although FYM-receiving soils were characterized by a 63% increase in WEOC as
compared to the UF soils, higher richness in terms of formulas detected (especially in the mid-polar
region, Fig. 2) and 10% larger overlap with NM markers (Figure 4), WEOM was more oxidized due to
FYM addition (Fig. 3c). This indicates that the FYM treatment increased the number of water-soluble
compounds, which generally tend to be more oxidized, hence explaining higher content and NOSC of
WEOM and relative WEOM to SOC ratio. This is reflected on a structural level as FYM treatment led

to a more polar, higher oxidized pool of WEOM compounds (higher O/C, lower H/C, higher NOSC;
higher N/C and lower mass of the most polar compounds, Fig. 3, Fig. S12). The differences between
treatments became undetectable for the least polar and most reduced compounds (Fig. 3c). Similar shifts
to more oxidized extractable OM upon long-term FYM addition were based on FT-IR spectroscopy,
indicating increased carboxyl-C contents (Kaiser and Ellerbrock, 2005; Ellerbrock et al.). Higher
amounts of WEOM and hydrophilic aliphatic compounds (e.g. long-chain carboxylic acids) were also
found after green manuring (Sharma et al., 2017). On the contrary, also presumably less mobile fractions
were found to be more responsive to long-term FYM addition, e.g. an enrichment of nonpolar alkyl
compounds (likely fatty acids) and peptides at the expense of aromatics (Mao et al., 2008) or an increase
in peptide- and RNA/DNA-related small metabolites in organic SOM extracts (Tang et al., 2023). Our
results from direct analysis of WEOM with LC-FT-ICR MS indicate that the most mobile fraction of
SOM (i.e., WEOM) shows a consistent response to long-term manuring.

The observed difference between FYM-treated soils and unfertilized controls can be explained by the
higher microbial activity leading to an increased oxidation of SOM. Like shown related to temperature
higher microbial activity is linked to higher DOC levels in soils (Kalbitz et al., 2000). Microorganisms
utilize readily available compounds with neutral to positive NOSC values (carboxylic acids, sugars and
some amino acids) to fuel their metabolism while reduced compounds and NM, as a result of anabolism
followed by cell death, may accumulate to form less soluble SOM that requires oxidation prior to reuse
(Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2022). Alternatively, manure itself is enriched with readily bioavailable
compounds which could explain higher NOSC values of WEOM in FYM-receiving soils. A more
oxidized WEOM may therefore indeed relate to an indirect effect of increased microbial oxidative
consumption of SOM initiated by long-term FYM addition.

Altogether we found that FYM addition favoured a WEOM composition that appears readily available
to bacteria or fungi. Since WEOM can be seen as a link between SOM pools, our findings point to an
increased potential for bacterial and fungal sequestration of C, in line with studies showing increased
SOC and nutrient storage, soil enzyme activity and microbial biomass in FYM-receiving soils (Hu et
al., 2024). On the other hand, our findings also indicate a loss of energy-poor SOM at the expense of an
increased microbial activity leading to the formation of SOM dominated by microbial NM. This would
suggest parallel priming (mineralisation of beforehand stable C) of existing SOM at the expense of a
build-up in necromass.

390
391
392
393

We therefore discuss if the molecular changes to WEOM are explained by an increased imprint of a)
bacterial or fungal NM markers (i.e., NM recycling following specific energy-use channels), b) litter
markers (increased leaching from plant NM) or c) unknown WEOM markers (potential SOM
decomposition products, possibly indicating processes such as priming).

FYM addition increases the share of NM markers in WEOM

Our data suggest an overall higher contribution of necromass to FYM-receiving as compared to control
soil WEOM (Fig. 4). Compared to control soils, the combined overlap of these markers was increased
by 3.0%, 2.5% and 1.6% for plant, bacterial and fungal NM maker, respectively, suggesting a stronger
increase of bacterial vs. fungal activity and an increased availability of soluble plant metabolites.
Additionally, shared markers between NM types (uNM) were increased by 3.5%, suggesting a general
increase in metabolites due to higher biotic activity. Together, NM markers therefore explained 10.7%
more intensity in FYM-receiving soil WEOM than in controls (i.e., 17.1% vs. 6.4%). The range of
overlapping markers extended to much more polar and oxidized compounds (earlier RT segments, Fig.
3c) than in control soil WEOM, where it was confined to later eluting, reduced compounds (Fig. 4a),
thus explaining increased NOSC levels (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, in control soils, the nonpolar, reduced
S-containing compounds (“CHOS”) belonged to BNM and uNM, while nonpolar, reduced N-containing
11

compounds (“CHNO”) were mainly linked to FNM, and no distinct overlap with CHO compounds
(containing neither S nor N) was found (Fig. 4c). In contrast, FYM-receiving soil WEOM showed a
wider NM imprint of CHNO compounds with all NM types (uNM and PNM: polar, oxidized
compounds; FNM and to a lesser extent BNM: nonpolar, reduced compounds); nonpolar and reduced
CHOS compounds were similarly linked to uNM and BNM fingerprints, and relatively polar CHO
compounds were linked mainly to the PNM fingerprint (Fig. 4c). The higher number of CHNO
compounds likely reflects a greater microbial activity in FYM-treated soils generally, since microbial
NM consists of residues or by-products of intact or ruptured cells or hyphae, as well as monomers or
polymers found within the cytoplasm, biofilm, or hyphal mucilage, such as polysaccharides
(peptidoglycan or chitin), proteins (including enzymes), and DNA (Buckeridge et al., 2022). A relatively
similar overlap of S-containing compounds in both treatments suggests similar S cycling independent
of the FYM treatment, and was mainly mediated by nonpolar, reduced forms of S likely related to
sulfolipids or long-chain sulfonic acids. An increased fraction of CHO metabolites from plants (PNM)
suggests stronger production of leachable compounds from plant litter in FYM-receiving soils.
Compared with the NM markers assigned by LC-FT-ICR-MS, original farmyard manure mass spectra
(measured by LDI-FT-ICR-MS, (Simon et al., 2024)) potentially contained 56% PNM markers and only
15% BNM markers, supporting the higher overlap with plant necromass. Yet, only an average 6% of
NM markers (4% BNM, 6% FNM, 7% PNM and 9% uNM) found in soil WEOM were also found in
the original manure mass spectra measured by LDI-FT-ICR-MS, suggesting that leachable NM markers
in soils originate from a different source than farmyard manure itself.

Our findings provide evidence of a stronger impact of NM on WEOM in FYM-receiving soils, and
suggest that especially oxidized N-containing compounds and plant-related oxidized CHO compounds
are differently cycled due to FYM addition, leading to their transfer into the water-extractable, and likely
bioavailable, SOM pool. The increased overlap with BNM markers suggests a shift towards an energyuse and N cycling channel dominated by bacteria over one dominated by fungi in non-fertilized soils. N
stands out as one of the primary nutrients restricting microbial growth, and it is known that manure
application increases fungal and bacterial diversity and enzymatic activity (Ma et al., 2020). It was
shown before that bacteria operate predominantly in narrow C:N environments with a labile pool of
detritus (here, FYM) while fungi dominate environments with less nutrients available and perform Nmining on more resistant detritus forms (here, SOM in control soils) (Moore et al., 2002). The observed
shift from a fungal to a bacterial WEOM imprint could therefore be linked to a shift from fungal Nmining in soils with little nutrient availability to bacterial recycling of easily available N from FYM
(Allison et al., 2007; Rousk and Bååth, 2007). Previous studies have demonstrated that fungi tend to
decompose recalcitrant SOC, such as lignin and cellulose, and bacteria then utilise the fungal-derived
products (Boer et al., 2005). The lack of easily-accessible plant NM-derived compounds in control soil
WEOM could be a reflection of the dominant role of fungal NM for N supply in nutrient-deprived
control soils (Op De Beeck et al., 2018).

An extended view of necromass markers in soil WEOM

Amino sugars, amino acids or other N-containing molecules are often used as markers of bacterial and
fungal NM (Withers et al., 2020). Among other compounds, muramic acid is an accepted indicator of
bacteria, while fungal contribution to SOM pools may be estimated via glucosamine (after correction)
or ergosterol (Glaser et al., 2004; Joergensen, 2018; Adamczyk et al., 2024; Salas et al., 2024). Using
known fractions of these markers in common microbial cells, one can derive estimates of microbial C/
SOM (Joergensen, 2018; Salas et al., 2024). However, amino sugars only account for about ~5% of Ncontaining compounds in SOM (Wu et al., 2023). Microbial residues were shown to contribute 15-80%
to the stable SOM pool (Liang et al., 2019; Hall et al., 2020; Angst et al., 2021). Our data suggest only
2-25% (average 7.9%) and 0-15% (4.8%) of unique microbial NM (= BNM + FNM) in FYM-receiving

and control soil WEOM, respectively. While this estimate based on molecular information (accounting
for the sum of detectable and assignable mass peak intensity) it aligns with the median 20% of microbial
contribution to mineral-associated organic matter in arable soils based on a C/N mixing model (Chang
et al., 2024) but are lower than amino sugar-based estimates of NM contribution in arable soils (40-80%
of SOC, average 50%). However, ratios of FNM over BNM contribution across RT segments ranged
from 0 to >4 in UF soil and 0.1 to 3 in FYM soil WEOM, approaching a reported ratio of FNM-C/
BNM-C of ~3 in agricultural soils (Liang et al., 2019) indicating a possible application to use the
molecular-level data to constrain (relative) NM contribution to stable SOM.

Our observation of a relatively low overlap of NM markers with soil WEOM could be due to the strong
polarity separation of WEOM in our study which provides double resolution on the polarity and mass
scale, thereby excluding false overlap between WEOM fingerprints (Adamczyk et al., 2024). 82.9% and
93.6% of cumulative intensity across the polarity range were unexplained by any of our NM markers in
FYM and UF soil WEOM, respectively. A possible reason for the large number of compounds left
unassigned to any of the sources is a lack of a comprehensive reference database of NM fingerprints
that would cover different organisms and NM decomposition stages (Camenzind et al., 2023). Here, we
chose only three representative NM types to cover the range of various NM sources, and used fresh,
undecomposed NM materials. However, looking at metabolic signals detected in at least two out of the
three NMs here (uNM), we only found 0-7% (average, 1.5%) or 1-15% (5.1%) overlap across the
polarity range.

Importantly, the NM markers found in soil WEOM only represented a fifth of the overall measured
intensity of their original NM spectra (BNM, 19%; FNM, 23%; PNM, 22%), leaving about 80% of
signals undetected in soil WEOM, despite being water-soluble. This may indicate that up to 80% of
leachable NM compounds are removed during (long-term) SOM formation, by processes such as
respiration, leaching, or mineral sorption, and are hence not detectable in soil WEOM (Lützow et al.,
2006). This process, constant recycling of bio- and necromass within soils (as well as the oceanic carbon
pools) through microbes has been coined the microbial carbon pump (MCP) and used to explain the
formation of persistent reduced carbon within mostly oxic environments (Jiao et al., 2010; Liang and
Balser, 2011; Lechtenfeld et al., 2015; Kästner and Miltner, 2018). In fact, the NOSC values of
molecules found only in NM were, by tendency, higher for BNM and FNM and lower for PNM (Figure
S16) as compared to the NM molecules also found in soil WEOM. This could indicate the usage and
recycling of NM compounds with lower energy contents, but it could also relate to other removal
mechanisms (sorption, etc.).

485
486
487
488

Finally, WEOM represents only a fraction of all SOM and is more processed, oxidized and lower in
molecular weight as compared to bulk SOM. The overlap with undecomposed NM may expectedly be
relatively small. Our data, however, show that a large fraction of low molecular weight WEOM is
relatively nonpolar and reduced (late RT segments in Fig. 2, Fig. 3c) and that NM contributes mainly to
this fraction even in non-fertilized soil WEOM (Fig. 4a, c). Which indicates that even due to the nonpolar
nature of NM we can use WEOM as a indicative proxy for NM fingerprinting within SOM.

All in all, LC-FT-ICR-MS enabled the detection of 194 and 377 unique fungal and bacterial markers,
respectively (Figure 6), as well as ~5000 plant markers and ~850 shared markers (uNM, Fig. S17). These
numbers suggest that the diversity of soluble microbial metabolites is much lower than that of plant
material, related to an overall more hydrophobic chemical composition of microbial necromasses. The
large range of microbial NM markers in comparison to classical bacterial and fungal biomarkers
highlights the added benefit of LC-FT-ICR-MS for constraining microbial imprints in soils. Classical
biomarker such as amino sugars or ergosterol are extracted from soils by acid hydrolysis or organic
solvents, respectively (Joergensen, 2018; Adamczyk et al., 2024). The intermediate position of the

water-extractable necromass markers between lipidic or carbohydrate-related markers now provides
access to an additional set of actively cycled metabolites with a wide range of polarities (uNM markers;
Fig S17 b). These additional metabolites were accessible without harsh chemical treatment or organic
solvent extraction. To structurally confine these novel necromass markers, FT-ICR-MS fragmentation
experiments could be conducted. Tandem MS can help to elucidate structural motifs within SOM
(Simon et al., 2022; DiDonato et al., 2023). This could enable not only the detection of shifts in the
molecular composition of SOM during substrate decomposition but also the recognition of alterations
in structural motifs associated with specific necromass types (Salas et al., 2024).

1) Release of stabilized SOM, that is mobilised due to an increase in microbial and enzyme activity and
a corresponding higher demand in energy and C that FYM itself cannot meet despite its highly available
C and N content (Murphy et al., 2015). This would indicate priming of SOM via FYM addition
(Gerzabek et al., 1997). Many studies have shown that the input of bioavailable OM to soil can stimulate
SOC mineralization (Kuzyakov et al., 2000; Fontaine et al., 2007; Kuzyakov, 2010). The compounds
provided by FYM; can be used to provide the energy needed to maintain the microbe pool within soils.

WEOM oxidation state is driven by compounds unrelated to necromasses

Despite larger overlap with NM markers of virtually all types and across all RT segments, the higher
oxidation state of WEOM was mainly driven by the contribution of compounds not related to any of the
NM fingerprints (Figure 5). This difference in NOSC between FYM-application and UF can be
explained by two, potentially co-occurring processes:

The increase in microbial bio- and necromass may therefore come at the expense of a stronger turnover
of SOM in general, and seems to favour the leaching of compounds low in energetic potential (higher
NOSC). Whether this effect may outweigh the benefit of increasing long-term SOC contents, along with
other risks of nutrient leaching losses and N2O emissions, should be investigated in more detail in future
(Poulton et al., 2018).

2) Production of molecules from metabolically active microbes that remain undetected in necromass
extracts. Of note, many of the compounds in WEOM not assigned to any of the NM fingerprints could
also be indicative of other NM types (see above), but the small overlap even with NM markers suggests
that also other processes (e.g. accumulation of persistent organic molecules due to microbial turnover)
must induce this large shift in NOSC. It has been shown before, that within carbon turnover
considerations in line with the theory of the soil microbial carbon pump (MCP) described mechanistic
pathways of metabolic turnover of C unrelated and therefore not measurable with a NM fingerprinting
approach pal a role (Liang and Balser, 2011; Jiao et al., 2024).

To disentangle both process further experiments that reflect the continuous degradation of NMs are
required.

Association.

We identified the molecular differences between farmyard manure-receiving and non-receiving soils
and characterized distinct markers of three major necromass types (plant, fungal, bacterial) and their
contribution to extractable SOM. The difference between FYM receiving soils and controls was
explained by an increased presence of necromass-derived compounds, but also show that a large portion
of WEOM was not accounted for by necromass-derived compounds. The fact that a majority of
molecules unrelated to NM explained shifts to a higher NOSC suggests that the increased activity of
microbes and hence, the production of necromass, may come at the expense of stronger oxidation of
SOM. This could lead to increased leaching losses of compounds with lower energetic potential, which
may be easily oxidized due to their favourable energetic properties. Further research efforts are required
to investigate this potential risk of long-term FYM addition to soils.
