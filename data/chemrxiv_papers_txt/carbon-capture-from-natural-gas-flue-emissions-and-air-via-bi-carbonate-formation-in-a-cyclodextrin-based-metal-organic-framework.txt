ABSTRACT: Carbon capture and utilization or sequestration (CCUS) from industrial point sources and direct air capture (DAC) are
both necessary to curb the rising atmospheric levels of CO2. Amine scrubbers, the current leading carbon capture technology, suffer
from poor oxidative and thermal stability, limiting their long-term cycling stability under oxygen-rich streams such as air and the
emissions from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. Herein, we demonstrate that the hydroxide-based cyclodextrin
metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST possesses high CO2 capacities from dry dilute streams at low temperatures and humid streams at elevated temperatures. Additionally, it displays good thermal, oxidative, and cycling stabilities and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Unexpectedly, under dry, hot conditions, a shift
in the CO2 adsorption mechanism—from reversibly formed bicarbonate to irreversibly formed carbonate—is observed, as supported
by gas sorption and spectroscopic studies. This mechanistic switch, akin to urea formation in amine-functionalized sorbents, has not
been previously reported in a hydroxide-based material and sheds new light on the interplay between bicarbonate and carbonate
species during CO2 capture. Our findings provide valuable insight for the design of next-generation materials containing oxygenbased nucleophiles for carbon capture applications.

Introduction.
One of the greatest challenges facing humankind is climate
change resulting from the rising atmospheric levels of CO2.1,2
Because we cannot switch over to low-emission energy sources
quickly enough, carbon capture and utilization or sequestration
(CCUS), in which CO2 is selectively removed from the emissions of fossil fuel-fired power plants, will be required to mitigate the rise in average global temperature over the next century.3,4 Global emissions from the combustion of natural gas for
energy production are on track to surpass those from coal over
the next decade, as they already have in the United States, making them a good target for future CCUS technologies.5 Further,
to address legacy emissions, direct air capture (DAC)—the use
of sorbents to remove CO2 from the atmosphere—will likely
also be necessary.1,6–9 Current approaches for CCUS and DAC
are likely too expensive for broad deployment without significant subsidies, necessitating the development of more efficient
carbon capture technologies.4
Removing CO2 from the flue gas of natural gas combined cycle
(NGCC) power plants (30–50 mbar CO2, 750 mbar N2, 100–
120 mbar O2, 11–100% relative humidity, 40–100 °C) and from
air (0.42 mbar CO2, 780 mbar N2, 210 mbar O2, 0–100% relative humidity) presents similar challenges.10,11 The primary
thermodynamic barrier for carbon capture from either stream is
the low partial pressure of CO2.12,13 Most sorbents cannot bind
CO2 efficiently at such low partial pressures, and those that can
require high temperatures (>120 °C) to release CO2, leading to
large energetic penalties and decomposition upon cycling.14,15
Another shared challenge is the high O2 content of both streams,
which contributes to the oxidative degradation of many
sorbents, such as amines.16–27 Competitive co-adsorption of
H2O over CO2 is also a limitation for sorbents such as zeolites.28

Owing to these challenges, effective sorbents for carbon capture
from NGCC emissions and air remain relatively rare.
The two leading technologies for carbon capture are (i) aminebased sorbents, including aqueous amine solutions29 and aminefunctionalized porous solids,30–33 and (ii) aqueous hydroxide
(OH−) solutions.34,35 Amine-based sorbents operate through the
selective reaction with CO2 to form ammonium carbamates, bicarbonates (HCO3−), and/or carbonates (CO32−). Although wellstudied for a range of carbon capture processes, most aminebased sorbents are plagued by oxidative degradation.16–27 For
example, the commercial polymer Lewatit R VP OC 1065 used
for DAC undergoes significant decomposition upon heating in
air.18,19,25 Aqueous OH− solutions have emerged as promising
alternatives for DAC due to their stability and high affinity for
CO2 via (bi)carbonate formation.34,35 The main limitations of
these systems are the high temperatures (>800 °C) and large
amounts of energy (>5 GJ/ton CO2) required for CO2 release
from the corresponding (bi)carbonate salts.36–39 For example,
CaCO3 must be heated to >800 °C to release CO2 and regenerate
active CaO in a calcium-looping process.34,35 Related OH−-rich
anion exchange membranes suffer from slow kinetics and low
capacities.40,41 New OH−-based sorbents that maintain the excellent oxidative stability and CO2 capture selectivity of OH−
salts but with lower regeneration costs, faster kinetics, and better performance under humid conditions would be cutting edge
materials for carbon capture from dilute streams.
Recently, we42 and others43–54 have shown that isolating reactive
OH− sites within porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
produces materials with high CO2 affinities, which are generally
proposed to operate via reversible HCO3− formation. Among
these, only Zn5(OH)4(bibta)3 (bibta2− = 5,5′-bibenzotriazolate)
and closely related materials have been definitively shown to

facilitate DAC under dry conditions.47 Unfortunately, most of
these materials, including Zn5(OH)4(bibta)3, do not capture CO2
under humid conditions.42,47 One potential avenue to address
this challenge would be to carry out carbon capture at elevated
temperatures (>100 °C), which has recently gained interest to
avoid unnecessary cooling of flue gas.55 However, the use of
OH−-rich porous solids for high-temperature CO2 capture has
not been demonstrated to date.
Herein, we establish a new solvothermal method to prepare the
framework Rb2CO3 CD-MOF (CD = cyclodextrin) from
Rb2CO3 (referred to herein as Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST). This
MOF possesses high CO2 uptake from dilute streams, including
dry air (~0.7 mmol/g at 25 °C) and NGCC emissions (~1.4
mmol/g at 40 °C). In addition, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST displays
similar or improved CO2 capture performance under humid
conditions at elevated temperatures (80–120 °C), a rare achievement for a OH−-based material. In exploring high-temperature
CO2 capture with Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST under dry conditions,
we also observed an unexpected shift in chemisorbed species
from reversibly formed HCO3− to irreversibly formed CO32−, as
supported by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform
spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) measurements. This change in mechanism—
akin to urea formation in amine-functionalized silicas56—has
not been observed previously in a OH−-based sorbent and provides important insight into the role of HCO3− and CO32− species upon CO2 capture in these materials. Elucidating the

mechanism of CO2 capture in Rb2CO3 CD-MOF paves the way
for the design of next-generation porous materials bearing nucleophilic OH− sites for carbon removal from dry and humid
streams. Additionally, our findings highlight that OH−-based
materials are best suited for capture from dry dilute streams at
low temperatures and humid streams at elevated temperatures.
Results and Discussion.
Our previous work demonstrated that the use of less basic precursors under ST conditions produces K-based CD-MOFs with
improved gas sorption properties compared to those traditionally prepared from KOH via vapor diffusion (VD).42 We also
found that moving from harder K to softer Rb cations in cubic
γ-cyclodextrin-based M2(OH)2(γ-CD) MOFs (Figure 1)57 leads
to stronger CO2 binding, but the reported framework
Rb2(OH)2(γ-CD) or CD-MOF-2 prepared via VD (referred to
herein as RbOH CD-MOF VD)58 exhibits poor thermal and mechanical stability, making it unsuitable for carbon capture applications.42
To better evaluate the suitability of Rb-based CD-MOFs for
CO2 capture from dilute streams, frameworks were prepared
from RbOH and Rb2CO3 as precursors under both VD and ST
conditions (see SI Section 2 for details).42,59 The resulting
frameworks—termed RbOH CD-MOF VD, RbOH CD-MOF
ST, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF VD, and Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST—were
characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) as well as
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface area analysis
(see SI Section 2 for details). Pawley refinements of PXRD data
confirm that RbOH CD-MOF VD (SI Figure S8), RbOH CDMOF ST (SI Figure S16), and Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST (SI Figure
S2) form the CD-MOF-2 cubic phase (Figure 1).58 Consistently,
SEM revealed that both RbOH CD-MOF VD (SI Figure S10)
and Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST (SI Figure S6) crystallize as welldefined cubes, with RbOH CD-MOF VD forming as large mmsized crystals and Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST forming as smaller
(~26 μm) crystals. In contrast, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF VD crystallizes as a distinct phase or mixture of phases that do(es) not
match any reported CD-MOF (SI Figure S11). SEM shows that
this material forms as rectangular plates instead of the desired
cubes (SI Figure S12). The 77 K N2 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF VD is also significantly lower (304 ± 1 m2/g, SI Figure S13) than that of Rb2CO3
CD-MOF ST (1199 ± 12 m2/g, SI Figure S3), highlighting the
advantage of solvothermal methods for synthesizing high surface area CD-MOFs.42
The optimal activation temperature for each CD-MOF under
flowing N2 was systematically determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (SI Figures S31–S34). To measure CO2
uptake capacities, pure CO2 at atmospheric pressure and 30 °C
was flowed over activated samples of all four frameworks (Figure 2a). Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST exhibits a much higher CO2 capacity (2.20 mmol/g) than Rb2CO3 CD-MOF VD (1.30
mmol/g). The poor performance of Rb 2CO3 CD-MOF VD is
presumably because it forms a less porous phase or mixture of
phases. In addition, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST outperforms frameworks prepared from RbOH under both VD (1.48 mmol/g) and
ST conditions (1.95 mmol/g). The superior uptake of Rb 2CO3
CD-MOF ST compared to RbOH CD-MOF VD is likely because the latter forms as large, mechanically fragile crystals (SI
Figure S10).
Beyond adsorption capacity, the long-term stability of adsorbents is a critical consideration for their application under realistic conditions. The oxidative and thermal stabilities of Rb2CO3

VD, as measured by TGA at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. The frameworks were activated under flowing N2 for 30 min at 80 °C, 90 °C, 120 °C,
and 70 °C, respectively. b) 30 °C pure CO2 adsorption profiles of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST after activation under flowing N2 for 30 min at 80
°C (blue) and after heating under flowing air at 80 °C for 8 h (red).

CD-MOF ST were evaluated by exposing it to flowing dry air
(~21% O2 in N2) at different temperatures for 8 h, simulating
hundreds of regeneration cycles (Figure 2b, SI Figure S30).
Minimal changes were observed in the pure CO2 adsorption
profile after the extended treatment at 80 °C, confirming the stability of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST towards O2 at moderately high
temperatures. This finding supports that Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST
displays exceptional CO2 uptake and thermal/oxidative stability
among Rb-based CD-MOFs. As such, its promise for CO2 capture from dilute streams was further evaluated (Figures 3–5).
To gain additional insight into the thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption in Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST, CO2 adsorption (closed circles) and desorption (open circles) isotherms were collected at
25 °C, 40 °C, and 55 °C (Figure 3a–b). This material exhibits
steep and reversible adsorption of CO2 at low pressures, leading
to good uptake from air (0.72 mmol/g at 0.40 mbar CO2 and 25
°C) and NGCC flue gas (1.40 mmol/g at 50 mbar CO2 and 40
°C) (Figure 3b). The adsorption isotherms were fit with dualsite Langmuir models (SI Tables S1–S3, see SI Section 3 for
details). Using these fits, the heats (−ΔHads), entropies (−ΔSads),
and free energies (−ΔGads) of adsorption at 25 °C and 40 °C as
a function of uptake for Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST were determined
using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (Table S4, see SI Section 3 for details). Intriguingly, the −ΔHads trend for Rb2CO3
CD-MOF ST supports that the mechanism of CO2 adsorption
switches from chemisorption (−ΔHads ≈ 64 kJ/mol) to physisorption (−ΔHads ≈ 20 kJ/mol) at a loading of approximately 1
mol CO2 per mol OH–, assuming a molecular formula of
Rb2(OH)2(γ-CD) (Figure 3c).58 This finding is consistent with
carbon capture via reversible HCO3− formation in this temperature range.42
Next, non-competitive CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivities for
Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST were calculated using N2 and O2 isotherms measured at 25 °C, 40 °C, and 55 °C (Figure 3a, triangles
and squares, respectively, SI Table S5). Fitting these isotherms
to dual-site Langmuir models (SI Figures S24–S25, Tables S2–
S4) confirms that Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST exhibits minimal affinity towards both N2 (−ΔHads = 9.6 ± 1.8 kJ/mol) and O2 (−ΔHads
= 3.1 ± 2.2 kJ/mol). Owing to the chemisorptive pathway for

CO2 adsorption, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST displays excellent noncompetitive CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivities. Under NGCC
flue gas conditions (50 mbar CO2, 120 mbar O2, 750 mbar N2,
40 °C), non-competitive CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivities of
212 and 257, respectively, were calculated (SI Table S5). For
DAC (0.4 mbar CO2, 210 mbar O2, 780 mbar N2, 25 °C),
Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST exhibits exceptional non-competitive
CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivities of 11530 and 13875, respectively (SI Table S5).
The kinetics of CO2 capture from dilute streams with Rb2CO3
CD-MOF ST were next evaluated via TGA (Figure 3d, see SI
Section 4 for details). Promisingly, this framework captures
1.30 mmol/g of CO2 from a 5% CO2 in N2 stream at 40 °C, with
saturation reached in less than 2 min. Under 400 ppm CO2 in air
at 25 °C, 0.76 mmol/g of CO2 was captured after 200 min, with
saturation nearly reached after 100 min. These capacities are
comparable to those measured isothermally (1.40 mmol/g and
0.72 mmol/g, respectively, Figure 3a). The slower adsorption
kinetics observed for DAC compared to higher % CO2 streams
can be attributed in part to the longer time needed for sufficient
CO2 to flow through and saturate the adsorbent (SI Table S6).
Compared to the commercial amine-based polymer Lewatit R
VP OC 1065, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST exhibits a similar adsorption capacity after 200 min (0.76 mmol/g for Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST vs. 0.70 mmol/g for Lewatit R VP OC 1065) and faster adsorption kinetics (SI Figure S48). Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST also
exhibits a comparable CO2 capacity to other OH−-based materials that have been previously studied for DAC (SI Table S8).

ppm), as measured by TGA at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. N2 adsorption is assumed to be negligible.

The promising performance of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST for carbon
capture from air and NGCC emissions encouraged us to evaluate its cycling performance in a simulated temperature-pressure
swing process using a N2 purge as a stand-in for a pressure
swing due to instrument limitations (Figure 4).60 As such,
Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST was subjected to 10 adsorption (dry 400
ppm CO2 in air, 25 °C) and desorption (dry N2, 80 °C) cycles
via TGA (Figure 4a, see Figure S22 for the full cycling data).
The cycled CO2 working capacity (~0.7 mmol/g) is comparable
to that measured in the adsorption isotherm (0.72 mmol/g, Figure 3b). Consistent with the accelerated decomposition test results (Figure 2b), Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST is stable upon cycling,
retaining 97% of its capacity after 10 DAC cycles. Next,
Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST was subjected to 100 adsorption (dry 5%
CO2 in N2, 40 °C) and desorption (dry N2, 80 °C) cycles in a
simulated carbon capture process from a NGCC emission
stream (Figure 4b). The CO2 working capacity (~1.3 mmol/g)
is again similar to that measured under ideal conditions in the

adsorption isotherm (1.40 mmol/g, Figure 3b). Rb2CO3 CDMOF ST retains >90% of its capacity after 100 cycles, further
reflecting its excellent thermal stability. When investigating the
cause of the slight decrease in the capacity of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST upon cycling, we noticed that it was not losing mass (as
might be expected if the material was degrading) but instead
was showing signs of partially irreversible CO2 uptake. This can
be best visualized using linear fits to the adsorption (blue), desorption (red), and cycling (black) capacities in Figure 4b. The
slope corresponding to the decrease in cycling capacity (–
0.0013 mmol/g•cycle) matches well to the slope corresponding
to the gradual increase in the desorption capacity upon cycling
(+0.0010 mmol/g•cycle). This finding suggests that desorption
of CO2 from this material is slightly irreversible upon cycling
under dry conditions (see further discussion below).

is assumed to be negligible.

To evaluate the performance of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST in a more
realistic fixed-bed adsorption process, multi-component breakthrough experiments were conducted with dry simulated NGCC
flue gas (5% CO2 in N2) using a custom-built apparatus (Figure
5, see SI Section 6 for details). Breakthrough experiments were
carried out by subjecting 0.387 g of activated Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST to 3 sccm of dry 5% CO2 in N2 at 40 °C (Figure 5a). Under
these conditions, N2 broke through the column nearly instantly,
followed much later by CO2. Importantly, the CO2 breakthrough profile was sharp, reflecting the favorable adsorption
kinetics in this material (Figure 3d). The breakthrough CO2 capacity was calculated to be 1.22 mmol/g (average of three experiments), which is comparable to the uptake under isobaric
(1.30 mmol/g, Figure 3d) and isothermal (1.40 mmol/g, Figure

3b) conditions. Consistent with the 40 °C N2 adsorption isotherm of this material (Figure 3a), its N2 capacity was found to
be negligible (<0.1 mmol/g). The breakthrough profile and capacity of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST were reproducible over three
cycles following re-activation of the material at 40 °C under
flowing dry He. Taken together, these gas sorption, cycling, and
breakthrough measurements support that Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST
is a promising material for carbon capture from dilute streams
under dry conditions.
All the measurements presented thus far were carried out in the
absence of H2O, yet air and NGCC flue gas generally contain
significant amounts of H2O. As such, the ability of Rb2CO3 CDMOF ST to capture CO2 from a humidified 5% CO2 in N2

dead time estimated by measuring the breakthrough time of Ar.

stream (~46% relative humidity at 20 °C) was evaluated using
breakthrough measurements (Figure 5b). First, the MOF was
pre-saturated with H2O by flowing humidified He through it until H2O was detected in the effluent stream using a residual gas
analyzer (RGA). After saturation, the inlet stream was switched
to a humidified 5% CO2 in N2 stream, and the breakthrough
measurement was carried out. Promisingly, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST still showed excellent CO2/N2 selectivity and a sharp breakthrough profile under these conditions, albeit with an attenuated
CO2 capacity (0.416 mmol/g) compared to that obtained under
dry conditions (1.22 mmol/g). The delayed breakthrough time
of N2 in the humid measurement can be attributed to the humidified N2 taking longer to reach the RGA due to pore-clogging
from the water in the MOF, as opposed to increased N2 adsorption. H2O adsorption measurements at 25 °C suggest this is
likely due to strong water uptake leading to pore clogging at low
temperatures (SI Figures S26–S27).
Given the strong CO2 affinity of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST, we hypothesized that it might show improved CO2 capture from humidified streams at elevated temperatures, where H2O physisorption should be suppressed.55 To evaluate this possibility,
dry and humid (~15% relative humidity at 20 °C) pure CO2 uptake profiles were collected via TGA at temperatures ranging
from 40 °C to 140 °C (Figures 6a and 7a, SI Figure S41, Table
S7). Under dry conditions, the expected behavior for a Langmuir adsorbent—decreasing adsorption capacity at higher adsorption temperatures—was observed (Figure 6a, blue). Nonetheless, the pure CO2 adsorption capacity of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST at 120 °C is still quite high (0.91 mmol/g or 4.0 g/100 g,),
reflecting its strong interaction with CO2. The material also saturates with CO2 within 2 min at every tested temperature (Figure 7a).
Although TGA cannot necessarily discriminate between the
(co-)adsorption of CO2 and H2O, in the humid TGA measurements, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST was pre-saturated with H2O under
flowing humid N2 at the indicated temperature before switching
the gas stream to humid CO2, allowing us to attribute the majority of the observed mass increase to CO2 adsorption (purple,
Figure 6b). Consistent with the humid breakthrough results
(Figure 5b), attenuated uptake (1.57 g/100 g, 0.397 mmol/g if

all CO2) was observed at 40 °C under humid conditions compared to dry conditions (8.67 g/100 g) (SI Figure S41). The observed capacity at 40 °C via humid TGA is similar to that measured via breakthrough from a humid 5% CO2 in N2 stream
(0.412 mmol/g, Figure 5b), supporting that the observed uptake
in the humid TGA measurement is largely due to CO2 adsorption. Even so, we cannot rule out that some co-adsorption of
H2O occurs under the tested conditions. In contrast to the dry
CO2 uptake results, increasing the temperature up to 100 °C under humid conditions led to greater CO2 uptake. This is likely
due to reduced H2O adsorption at higher temperatures, allowing
for more efficient CO2 capture. Between 100–120 °C, the dry
and humid CO2 uptake capacities are nearly identical, supporting that Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST is capable of selectively removing CO2 from humid streams at elevated temperatures. Notably,
rapid CO2 adsorption was still observed in humidified Rb2CO3
CD-MOF ST, with saturation reached in 5 min at all tested temperatures (SI Figure S41). Overall, these findings suggest that
OH−-based adsorbents like Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST may be best
suited for carbon capture from humid streams in an intermediate
temperature regime (80–120 °C), given that many of them
struggle to capture CO2 efficiently from humid streams at lower
temperatures.42,47

temperature and d) upon heating to 165 °C and standing at this temperature for 18.5 h. The stretches corresponding to HCO 3− (blue) and
CO32− (orange) species are indicated.

Isothermal cycling experiments were conducted at 90 °C and
100 °C to further compare the high-temperature CO2 capture
performance of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST under both dry and humid
conditions (Figure 6b, see SI Figure S39 for full cycling data).
The MOF was subjected to 21 adsorption (100% CO2, 90 °C or
100 °C, 5 min) and desorption (N2, 90 °C or 100 °C, 55 min)
cycles via TGA. Longer desorption times than those employed
at lower temperatures (30 min, Figure 4) were needed to fully
desorb H2O under humid conditions, but shorter adsorption
times (5 min) could be employed (to maintain an overall 1 h
cycle time) due to the fast adsorption kinetics of this material at
all temperatures. Under humid conditions, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST retained >70% of its original working capacity after 20 cycles at both 90 °C and 100 °C, reflecting good performance for
CO2 capture from hot, humid streams. Unexpectedly, the results

obtained under dry conditions were drastically different at the
two temperatures: at 90 °C, excellent cycling stability was observed, but at 100 °C, the CO2 uptake declined significantly,
reaching near 0% retention of the original capacity after 18 cycles (Figure 6b). Notably, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST retains crystallinity upon heating under pure CO2 at 140 °C for 2 h, indicating
that this irreversible uptake is not due to framework degradation
(SI Figure S46). This finding suggests that, at ≥100 °C, Rb2CO3
CD-MOF ST shows improved cycling stability under humid
conditions than under dry conditions. To the best of our
knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported to date in
any OH−-based adsorbent.
The mechanistic underpinnings of the irreversible CO2 uptake
upon cycling Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST under dry hot CO2 at ≥100
°C were interrogated using gas-sorption and spectroscopic

CD-MOF ST (top), compared to urea formation in amine-functionalized solids under similar conditions (bottom).

methods (Figure 7). Heating Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST to ≥130 °C
under both dry (Figure 7a) and humid (SI Figure S40) flowing
CO2 leads to irreversible CO2 uptake. This trend can be best
visualized using the CO2 adsorption/desorption profiles;
switching the inlet gas from dry, pure CO2 at 130, 140, or 150
°C to pure N2 at 80 °C did not result in full desorption of CO2
and return to the initial sample mass (Figure 7a). This finding is
consistent with the slightly irreversible CO2 uptake observed
upon cycling with 40 °C CO2 under dry conditions (Figure 4b).
Similarly, a significant loss in capacity due to irreversible uptake was observed when Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST was subjected to
10 adsorption (dry 5% CO2 in N2, 40 °C) and desorption (dry
100% CO2, 145 °C) cycles in a simulated temperature-swing
adsorption process (SI Figure S37).
We hypothesized that extended exposure to hot, dry CO 2 could
be mediating conversion of two adjacent HCO3− sites to one
CO32− species with concomitant loss of water and CO2, akin to
what happens when KHCO3 is heated to produce K2CO3 and
H2O (Figure 8, top).61 The reverse reaction is proposed to govern CO2 capture in moisture-swing sorbents,62–65 but a clear
mechanistic switch from HCO3− to CO32− upon cycling a OH−based sorbent has not been reported to date. Nonetheless, similar phenomena have been observed upon cycling amine-functionalized silicas under dry conditions due to a change in mechanism from reversible ammonium carbamate to irreversible
urea formation (Figure 8, bottom).56 This hypothesis would also
explain why Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST shows improved cycling stability at high temperatures in the presence of H2O (Figure 6b),
which should suppress H2O loss from HCO3− to form CO32−.
Consistent with this hypothesis, the irreversible mass gain of
Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST at 140–150 °C stabilizes at a capacity of
approximately 0.5 mol CO2 per mol OH–, as would be expected
if two adjacent OH– sites were reacting with CO2 to produce one
CO32− species (Figure 7a). Similarly, the irreversible uptake of
this material in a simulated temperature-swing adsorption process (with desorption under dry, pure CO2 at 145 °C) also stabilizes at a capacity corresponding to 1 CO2 per 2 OH− sites (SI
Figure S37). Irreversible CO32− formation in Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST at high temperatures is further supported by TGA decomposition measurements (SI Figure S28). When heated under dry
flowing N2, Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST shows no significant weight
change until approximately 225 °C, when it undergoes decomposition. Markedly different behavior was observed upon heating Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST under dry, pure CO2. Between 135 °C
and 200 °C, the mass of this sample stabilizes at a value corresponding to 1 CO2 per 2 OH− sites. Together, these thermogravimetric measurements support that CO2 capture in Rb2CO3 CDMOF ST occurs via reversible HCO3− formation at low temperatures, but at high temperatures and upon cycling under dry conditions, a switch in mechanism occurs to irreversibly form
CO32− species with concomitant loss of H2O.

To test the hypothesis of CO32− formation in Rb2CO3 CD-MOF
ST at high temperatures under CO2 flow, we performed magic
angle spinning (MAS) 13C SSNMR (Figure 7b, see SI Section 8
for details) and DRIFTS measurements (Figure 7c–d, see SI
Section 5 for details). The proton-decoupled Hahn echo MAS
13
C SSNMR spectrum of activated Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST only
contains resonances corresponding to the γ-CD units, as expected (Figure 7b, black).66 Dosing this MOF with 13CO2 at
room temperature leads to the appearance of a complex set of
resonances centered at ~160 ppm (Figure 7b, blue). This chemical shift range is generally indicative of HCO3−, as it is similar
to the chemical shift of KHCO3 (161 ppm) as well as HCO3−
species formed in OH−-charged porous carbons (156 ppm).67
The complexity of this signal suggests that multiple chemisorbed species form upon CO2 dosing, which is likely due to the
presence of different hydrogen-bonding environments provided
by the neighboring γ-CD units. Heating Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST
under dry, hot 12CO2 flow for 2 h (used instead of 13CO2 due to
cost) led to the complete disappearance of these resonances and
the appearance of a single new resonance centered at 168 ppm
(Figure 7c, red). This chemical shift is consistent with CO32−, as
it is identical to the chemical shift of K2CO3 (168 ppm).68 Additionally, in cross-polarized (CP) MAS SSNMR experiments,
the carbonate signal is not observed due to the absence of any
nearby protons, further supporting its assignment as CO32− (SI
Figure S60). Thus, our CP MAS 13C SSNMR spectroscopic
studies support the unprecedented mechanistic switch from
HCO3− to CO32− upon heating Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST under hot,
dry CO2.
To further verify these assignments, DRIFTS spectra of Rb2CO3
CD-MOF ST were collected under four conditions: (1) dry N2
at room temperature (black, Figure 7c), (2) under increasing
pressures of dry CO2 at room temperature (Figure 7c), (3) under
flowing dry, pure CO2 at temperatures between 40 °C and 165
°C, and (4) under flowing CO2 for 18.5 h at 165 °C (Figure 7d).
The DRIFTS spectra of Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST after dosing with
CO2 at room temperature contain a clear new C=O stretch at
1675 cm–1 that is absent in the parent MOF (highlighted in blue,
Figure 7c). This stretch is consistent with the C=O stretch in
pure KHCO3 (1683 cm−1, SI Figure S49) and thus is assigned to
a HCO3− species.42 Upon heating under flowing dry CO2, this
peak is preserved but with slightly decreased intensity (Figure
7d). Above 140 °C, the HCO3– stretch begins to decrease in intensity, and a new stretch appears at 1645 cm–1 (highlighted in
orange), which is similar to the CO32– stretch in pure K2CO3
(1649 cm−1) and Rb2CO3 (1650 cm−1) (SI Figure S49). Heating
the material under flowing CO2 at 165 °C causes the HCO3–
stretch at 1675 cm–1 to gradually disappear and the CO32– stretch
at 1645 cm–1 to further increase in intensity, along with the
growth of a new stretch at 2045 cm–1 (orange box). The stretch
at 2045 cm–1 is present in the DRIFTS spectra of K2CO3 and
Rb2CO3 but not KHCO3 (SI Figure S49) and is likely a combination band, which are diagnostic of carbonate minerals. 69,70 As
such, these DRIFTS spectra further support a gradual transition
from HCO3– to CO32– upon prolonged heating of Rb2CO3 CDMOF ST under dry CO2.
Taken together, these gas sorption and spectroscopic studies
strongly support a temperature-based change in adsorption
mechanism in Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST, from reversible formation
of HCO3− at low temperatures to irreversibly formed CO32− at
high temperatures and/or upon prolonged cycling. This parasitic
mechanism has important implications for the performance of
OH−-based sorbents under both dry and humid conditions, as it

seems that the presence of H2O can somewhat suppress CO32−
formation at high temperatures (Figure 6b). The same phenomenon has also been observed for amine-functionalized silicas
that are prone to urea formation under dry conditions. 56
Conclusion.
The OH–-based framework Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST possesses
high CO2 capacities from dilute streams such as air and NGCC
emissions while exhibiting excellent oxidative, thermal, and cycling stabilities and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions. Intriguingly, under humid, hot conditions, Rb 2CO3 CDMOF ST displays reversible CO2 chemisorption, which is rare
for OH–-based materials. However, under dry, hot conditions,
the reversibly formed HCO3– transforms into CO32–, which has
not been previously observed in a OH–-based material. These
findings suggest that Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST is a promising CO2
sorbent for DAC and high temperature NGCC emissions capture processes. In developing CO2 capture materials, we propose that reactive OH– sites should be spaced far apart to productively capture CO2 without compromising reversibility upon
extended cycling. Our discoveries reveal structural trends in
MOFs that will aid in the design of next-generation materials
containing oxygen-based nucleophiles for carbon capture from
dry and humid streams.
