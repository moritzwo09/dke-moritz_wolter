Abstract
Gas-phase reactions of atomic sulfur in its first electronically excited metastable
state, S(1 D), with water and methanol have been theoretically investigated to characterize their potential energy surfaces, the reaction mechanisms, and product branching
fractions. According to our results, both reactions proceed with the formation of bound
intermediates that, for the isolated systems, decompose into products because of the

large energy content with which they are formed. The SO(a 1 ∆) + H2 channel is the
only open for the S(1 D) + H2 O reaction, while many channels are open for the S(1 D)
+ CH3 OH reaction. For the latter case, statistical estimates of the product branching
fractions indicate that the main channels are those leading to CH2 OH + SH, H2 CO +
H2 S, H2 CS + H2 O, and CH3 + HSO. The mechanism of the related O(1 D) + CH3 SH
reaction has also been unveiled.
Since the reaction intermediates can be stabilized by energy loss to surrounding
species on ice or in liquid water, to gain some insight into the possible effects of water
molecules we have also analyzed how the two reactions behave when four additional
water molecules are added. The conclusion is that the initial intermediates formed
by the insertion or addition mechanism − namely HOSH (hydrogen thioperoxide) and
H2 OS for S(1 D) + H2 O and CH2 OHSH (mercaptomethanol), CH4 OS and CH3 OSH
(methyl thioperoxide) for S(1 D) + CH3 OH, as well as CH3 SOH (methyl sulfenic acid)
for O(1 D) + CH3 SH − will probably be stabilized by the interaction with the additional
water molecules.
Our results can help in understanding sulfur chemistry in space, especially in the
case of comets. On one side, the S(1 D) + H2 O gas-phase reaction could account for
the additional SO source necessary to explain the observed distribution of this species
obtained by using the Plateau de Bure interferometer of Institut de Radioastronomie
Millimétrique (IRAM) for the Hale Bopp comet. On the other side, some of the S/Ocontaining molecules identified by ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion
and Neutral Analysis) during the enhanced dust emission events of the 67/P comet
(e.g. species with gross formula HSO, H2 SO, and CH4 OS) could be the results of the
chemistry occurring on ice that we have exposed in this work.

1. Introduction
Sulfur, with an atomic fraction of 16 ppm, is the tenth most abundant element in the Solar
System. It is one of the six most common elements in living organisms (it belongs to the

CHNOPS group − standing for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur
− which together make up more than 96% of the mass of living organisms) and it is present
in two (cysteine and methionine) of the twenty amino acids common to all life forms as well
as in other important sulfur-bearing biomolecules.
A handful of simple sulfur molecules (e.g. H2 S, CS, SO) have been widely detected in the
interstellar medium. 1 Other species (e.g. SiS, HS, NS, HCS, HSC, HSCN, H2 CS, CH3 SH,
C3 S, C4 S, C5 S, H2 CCS, HCCS, CHOSH, CH3 CH2 SH) have been more rarely observed. 2
Detecting reduced sulfur compounds and organosulfur species in star-forming regions and
protoplanetary disks is particularly interesting because of the implications in the chemistry
of early Earth. However, when considering the abundance of sulfur compounds in cold
prestellar cores, S turns out to be significantly depleted from the gas phase (the “sulfur
depletion problem” 1,3–8 ), suggesting its presence in the small dust particles (and their icy
mantles) that account for ca. 1% by mass of those interstellar regions. However, the main
sulfur reservoir species in the dust particles or their icy mantles remains unknown. Currently,
OCS is the only S-bearing molecule securely detected in interstellar ice. 9–12
The inventory of S-containing species becomes much richer when we consider small
objects of the Solar System. Simple species like H2 S, OCS, SO, SO2 , S2 , CS2 , and NS
have been identified in the coma of several comets for some years. 13–23 In the case of
the 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet, the Rosetta orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and
Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) was able to identify other species like S3 , S4 , CH3 SH, and
C2 H5 SH/CH3 SCH3 . 24–26 Furthermore, during several enhanced dust emission events (that
allowed the release of semivolatile species in the proximity of the instrument) the detection of
complex organic molecules including S-bearing species (e.g. CH3 OS, CH4 OS, C2 H4 OS) 27,28
and even ammonium hydrosulfide salt NH4 SH 29 was achieved. Very rich is the sulfur chemical inventory of the near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu, the surface material
of which was brought to Earth by the Hayabusa2 mission 30–32 as well as that of meteorites
like Murchinson and Allende. 33 Clearly, there is some unknown chemistry converting the

simple S-molecules detected in star-forming regions into the more complex species seen in
pristine small objects like comets and asteroids/meteorites. Impacts of these bodies on planets were common during the early history of Earth and may have allowed the delivery of
organic molecules from which life emerged. 34
Atomic sulfur is characterized by a low-lying metastable electronic state, 1 D (radiative
lifetime of 28 s; energy content of 110.5 kJ/mol with respect to the 3 P ground state 35 ). In
space, it is routinely produced by UV-induced photodissociation of some molecules, such as
OCS, CS2 , and S2 , 36–39 while photodissociation at λ ≤ 155 nm (including the Lyman−α
wavelength) of H2 S and SO2 can also produce directly S(1 D) with a significant quantum
yield. 40–42 Given its short radiative lifetime, S(1 D) is not expected to significantly contribute
to the chemical evolution of the most rarefied regions of our Galaxy. However, it might
contribute in regions where the number density is higher (e.g. in internal regions of protoplanetary disks or in cometary comae and planetary atmospheres). In addition to that,
the reactions of the electronically excited metastable state 1 D of atomic oxygen have been
recently invoked to account for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules in
interstellar ice. 43–46 A similar mechanism could take place starting from the UV-induced
photodissociation of OCS (already identified in interstellar ice) or other S-bearing species
making S(1 D) reactions on ice a viable route toward the formation of more complex Smolecules. Finally, the reactions of S(1 D) may also be of relevance in atmospheric chemistry.
Several reduced sulfur compounds are abundantly released from biogenic sources. Such reduced sulfur compounds are partly converted to OCS, the most abundant atmospheric sulfur
species. 47,48 OCS is a relatively inert species that reaches the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere where it photodissociates in the window between the O2 and O3 absorption bands
producing CO and S(3 P,1 D), with the spin allowed production of S(1 D) being the dominant
channel. 49,50
In previous work, we reported the study of the reaction mechanism for the systems
S(1 D) + C2 H2 , S(1 D) + C2 H4 , and S(1 D) + CH4 . 51–55 Those reactions were investigated by

means of the crossed molecular beam method with mass spectrometric detection. Electronic
structure calculations of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) were also carried out, 51–55
and statistical estimates of the product branching fractions (BFs) were performed for the
multichannel S(1 D) + C2 H4 reaction. 51,55 These three reactions were also found to be very
fast (the rate coefficients are in the gas kinetic limit also at very low temperatures - as
low as 23 K). 51,52,54 As in the analogous O(1 D)/O(3 P) case, from our previous work we
learned that S(1 D), besides being much more reactive than S(3 P), can undergo insertion
reactions (in which the excited atom can position itself into one of the preexisting σ bonds
of the reaction partner forming two new sigma bonds) as well as add to the π system of
unsaturated hydrocarbons. In this respect, it is also similar to the case of the reactions of
other electronically excited states of atomic species, like C(1 D) and N(2 D) (see, for instance,
Ref.s 56–61 ).
In this manuscript, we extend the same theoretical approach to characterizing the S(1 D)
reactions with water and methanol. The choice of these two systems is given by the fact that
water is the most abundant molecule in cometary comae as well as in interstellar ice, while
CH3 OH also has a significant abundance in both cases. 9,14,62–64 Contrarily to other electronically excited atomic species (e.g. O(1 D), C(1 D), and N(2 D) 65,66 ), S(1 D) has been spectroscopically identified in cometary comae rarely (e.g. in the comet 153P/ Ikeya-Zhang 67 ).
However, given the fact that so many processes lead to its formation 36–42 and that its radiative lifetime is not too small 35 (the number density in the proximity of the comet nucleus
is large enough for it to undergo collisions within its decay), its gas-phase reactions have
already been invoked to explain the formation mechanism of some sulfur species 68,69 in alternative to its physical quenching (considered to be caused mostly by collisions with water
molecules). 70 In addition to that, the results presented here can provide some insight into
the possible S(1 D) chemistry on interstellar ice or in atmospheric aerosols containing S(1 D)
precursors.
Unfortunately, we cannot investigate the S(1 D) + H2 O reaction experimentally with the

crossed molecular beam method because the heavy product of the only open channel is
SO (+ H2 ) which is largely present in our atomic sulfur beam produced by radiofrequency
discharging a mixture of SO2 and He 51–55 and strong interference from elastic scattering is
expected. According to our calculations, indeed, the two-product reaction channels are

where the enthalpies of reaction of each channel are those resulting from our calculations at the CCSD(T)/CBS level (in parentheses the accepted values in the literature when
available 71 ). To gain insight into the possible effects of the presence of surrounding water
molecules (either in interstellar ice or in atmospheric aerosols), we also derived the reactive potential energy surface in the presence of four additional water molecules forming a
small cluster (4WMC). The reaction mechanism significantly changes because of the H-bond

The reaction mechanism for S(1 D) + CH3 OH is much more complex and numerous twoproduct channels are open. In anticipation of possible experiments with the CMB technique,
we have also characterized the reaction mechanism for the related system O(1 D) + CH3 SH.
Also in these two cases, we have considered the effect of the presence of four water molecules,
but at a lower level of calculations because of the computational cost.
The structure of the manuscript is as follows: In Section 2, we present the methods
employed to carry out the electronic structure calculations of the relevant stationary points
along the PESs and RRKM estimates of the product BFs for the reaction S(1 D) + CH3 OH.
In section 3, we present the main features of the PESs for the two isolated systems and
the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) estimates of BFs for the S(1 D) + CH3 OH
reaction. In section 4 we present our results for the S(1 D) reaction with water and methanol
in the presence of four additional water molecules. In section 5, the discussion and the
related astrophysical implications are presented. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.

2. Methods
The relevant potential energy surfaces have been investigated by localizing the stationary
points using the ωB97XD functional 72 in conjunction with the correlation consistent valence
polarized set aug-cc-pVTZ, 73 augmented with a tight d function with exponent 2.457 for
the sulfur atoms to correct for the core polarization effects 74 (we denote this basis set as
aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z). At the same level of theory, we have computed the harmonic vibrational
frequencies. With the exception of the S(1 D) + CH3 OH reaction with 4WMC, the energy of
all the stationary points of the PESs was then computed at the higher level CCSD(T) 75,76
using the same basis set aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z. Both the ωB97XD and the CCSD(T) energies
were corrected to 0 K by adding the zero point energy correction computed using the scaled
harmonic vibrational frequencies evaluated at the ωB97XD level. All the structure optimizations and CCSD(T) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package. 77

Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations 78 at the same DFT level of theory were performed to confirm the transition states to be uniquely connected to the local minima and
the corresponding reaction products. More accurate calculations were then performed for
the isolated H2 OS and CH4 OS systems at the CCSD(T) level corrected with a density-fitted
(DF) MP2 extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) and with corrections for core electron excitations. Using this algorithm implemented with the Molpro program package, 79 the
energy was computed as follows:

E = E(CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z) + [E(CCSD(T,core)/cc-pVTZ) −
− E(CCSD(T)/cc-pV(T+d)Z)] + [E(DF-MP2/CBS/cc-pV(T+d)Z) −

(3)

− E(DF-MP2/CBS/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z)]
where the tight d function was added to the sulfur basis set, as suggested by Wilson
and Dunning. 80 Martin’s two-parameter scheme 81 for extrapolation was also employed. For
simplicity, this level of calculations will be denoted CBS in the rest of the paper. Regarding
the electronically excited atoms, we added the experimental energy difference between the
corresponding 3 P ground state and the 1 D excited state to compute the electronic energies of
S(1 D) and O(1 D). The adopted values were 110.5 kJ/mol for S(3 P)−S(1 D) energy split and
189.5 kJ/mol for O(3 P)−O(1 D) split. 35,82 Since we could not optimize the CH3 S structure
using the ωB97XD functional, for this species we have used the B3LYP/aug- cc-pV(T+d)Z
method. 73,74,83,84
RRKM calculations were performed to estimate the statistical product BFs for the
S(1 D)+CH3 OH reaction at various temperatures and zero pressure, using a home-made code
developed for this purpose, previously employed for many systems. 51,56,58,60,61,85 This approach can be applied to bimolecular reactions when one or more bound intermediates are
present along the minimum energy path. In the framework of the RRKM theory, a statistical
redistribution of the available energy among all the degrees of freedom is taken into account.

The 1-dimensional Master Equation is solved by computing all the relevant microcanonical
rate constants and neglecting the effect of angular momentum conservation. The microcanonical rate constants for each unimolecular channel were calculated using the following
formula:

k(E) =

N (E)
hρ(E)

(4)

where E is the total energy available to the intermediates, N (E) corresponds to the
sum of states of the transition state at energy E, h is the Planck constant, and ρ(E) is the
density of states. While ρ(E) was estimated by counting the number of vibrational states
per energy range, N (E) was computed by integrating the density of states of the transition
state in the specific energy interval 0 − E. On the other hand, the rotational density of
states was estimated using well-known classical expressions (as derived, for example, by
an inverse Laplace transform of the corresponding partition functions) and subsequently
convoluted with the vibrational ones. We also considered quantum tunneling using the
corresponding imaginary frequency of the transition state and simulating the barrier by a
symmetric Eckart barrier to calculate the tunneling probability. For the barrierless exit
channels, the best treatment of ”loose” transition states (monotonic dissociation channels)
would be a variational treatment. However, as this approach has proved too demanding
given the complexity of the system, we have opted to assume, in these cases, a ”productlike” transition state (where product molecule rotations are treated like internal rotations).
This approach, in accord with the variational principle, yields an upper bound to the true
rate constant. As this transition state corresponds to the maximum energy, the rate constant
obtained should not be too far from the true one.
Once branching fractions have been obtained as a function of total energy, these are
averaged assuming a prior Boltzmann distribution for the reactants (S(1 D) + CH3 OH) at
the representative temperatures of interstellar ice and comets (10, 100 K) and at room
temperature.

3. Results
3.1 The potential energy surface for the gas-phase S(1 D) + H2 O
reaction
The following description will refer to the energy values calculated at the CBS level. The
energy values are reported rounded to the nearest kJ/mol considering the accuracy of the
calculations. In Figure 1 and in the Supporting Information (SI), the values obtained at
the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z level of theory are also shown for comparison because the
calculations relative to the same reaction in the presence of four additional water molecules
could be carried out only at this level. The comparison between the two sets of values,
therefore, is a way to assess the accuracy of the lower-level calculations. The ωB97XD
energy values are also shown in the SI for comparison (all energies in hartrees).
As expected, the interaction of S(1 D) with the water molecule starts with two different
approaches: i) insertion into one of the OH bonds of water or ii) addition to one of the lone
pairs of the oxygen atom of the water molecule. In both cases, a low-lying bound intermediate
is formed (MIN1, located at −98 kJ/mol with respect to the reactants asymptote, for addition
and MIN2, located at −258 kJ/mol, for insertion - see Figure 1). In principle, S(1 D) could
also abstract one H atom, but the channel leading to OH + SH is endothermic by 32 kJ/mol
and cannot contribute under the typical conditions of most environments.
Once formed, MIN1 can easily rearrange to MIN2 by overcoming a barrier of 48 kJ/mol
(associated with TS1) or dissociate to the products SO + H2 . In this case, a very high barrier
must be overcome (243 kJ/mol), as is typical for a three-center H2 elimination channel, thus
implying that this pathway makes a negligible contribution under common conditions (the
associated TS4 is 145 kJ/mol above the reactants energy asymptote). As this is a singlet
PES, SO is formed in its lowest singlet state a 1 ∆ rather than in the ground triplet state X
3

Σ− .
Once formed (either directly by insertion or after the isomerization of MIN1), MIN2 can

dissociate into the products OH + SH (an endothermic channel with ∆H0o = + 32 kJ/mol),
HSO + H (an endothermic channel with ∆H0o = + 51 kJ/mol), HOS + H (an endothermic
channel with ∆H0o = + 65 kJ/mol) or also isomerize to MIN3 or MIN1. The isomerization to
MIN1 does not lead to any exit channel, while the isomerization to MIN3 (located at −188
kJ/mol) finally leads to the only open two-product channel through an accessible exit barrier
associated with TS3. Also in this case, the three-center elimination of H2 is characterized
by a very large barrier of 178 kJ/mol which, however, remains below the reactants energy
asymptote because of the depth of the potential well associated with MIN3. Therefore, the
SO(a 1 ∆) + H2 channel is the only open two-product channel.

+ H2 S entrance channel are also shown in red.
It is interesting to note that MIN2 and MIN3 are the same intermediates formed in the
related reaction O(1 D) + H2 S which has been previously investigated at another level of
theory. 86 If we consider the energy of the stationary points at the G2 level calculated by

Goumry et al., 86 starting from the O(1 D) + H2 S asymptote, a value of −369.3 kJ/mol was
derived for MIN1, −535.6 kJ/mol for MIN2, and −462.5 kJ/mol for MIN3. For TS1 (TS5
in the paper by Goumri et al. 86 ) they obtained a value of −330.6 kJ/mol, for TS2 (TS3 in
the paper by Goumri et al. 86 ) a value of −294.2 kJ/mol, and for TS3 (TS2 in the paper
by Goumri et al. 86 ) a value of −294.5 kJ/mol. A very good agreement is noted despite the
different theoretical methods employed.

In addition to that, our calculations also nicely reproduce the ∆H0,r

kJ/mol for channel (1b) that can be derived by using the accepted values of ∆H0,f

and SH. 71 The agreement is also good when considering the difference in energy with respect
to the SO product in its ground triplet state (X3 Σ− ) which is - 143.75 kJ/mol (when using
the values by Atkinson et al. 71 ) to be compared with -141 kJ/mol of the present calculations.
However, the energy of the excited SO(a1 ∆) corresponds to 91 kJ/mol to be compared with
the accepted value of 77.11 kJ/mol (T0 =5861 cm−1 , see Ref. 87 ). Therefore, the method
employed confirms its problems in dealing with electronic excitation.
The comparison between CBS and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z energy values are in reasonably good agreement with the latter being systematically higher by ca. 10 kJ/mol. To be
noted that TS2 and TS3, the transition states that make the SO(a 1 ∆) + H2 channel open at
the CBS level, are slightly above the energy of the reactants asymptote at the CCSD(T)/aug◦
cc-pV(T+d)Z level of theory while the ∆H0,r
for the channel (1b) is significantly different

with respect to the literature accepted value (-35 kJ/mol vs -66.7 kJ/mol).

3.2 The CH4 OS potential energy surface
The two reactions S(1 D) + CH3 OH and O(1 D) + CH3 SH share a common PES. For this
reason, we will describe the reaction mechanism also for the O(1 D) + CH3 SH reaction keeping
in mind that, in this case, higher energy TSs and products are accessible because of the
extra 226 kJ/mol available to the system. The reaction pathways are sketched in Figures
2 and 3. Because of the complexity of the PES, we have split it into two parts. The

pathways originating by each intermediate are reported only once but they are present for
both schemes. In both figures, the energy of the S(1 D) + CH3 OH reactants is assumed as
the zero of energy.
3.2.1 The gas-phase S(1 D) + CH3 OH reaction
As expected, the S(1 D) + CH3 OH reaction can start with different approaches: a) S(1 D)
can insert into one of the C−H bonds of the methyl group of methanol forming the W1
intermediate (mercaptomethanol, W1); b) S(1 D) can add to one of the lone pairs of the oxygen
atom of methanol forming the W2 intermediate; c) S(1 D) can insert into the O−H bond of
methanol forming W5 (methyl thioperoxide). W1, W2, W5, and W4 (methyl sulfenic acid,
that can be formed by the isomerization of W2 or by the O(1 D) reaction with methanethiol)
are associated with deep wells and are singlet closed-shell species. Their structures are shown
in Figure 4 together with those of the relevant transition states and the structures of the
unusual molecular products that can be formed in the reaction.
We will comment now on the possible fate of these intermediates.
Once formed, W1 evolves through the pathways illustrated in Figure 2 (red lines) and
reported in Table 1. In particular, by overcoming a barrier associated with either TS1, TS4,
TS2, TS3, or TS5, W1 can i) eliminate a molecule of water forming either thioformaldehyde
(in a very exothermic channel) or its isomer thiohydroxycarbene; ii) eliminate a molecule
of hydrogen sulfide forming formaldehyde (in a very exothermic channel) or its isomer hydroxycarbene; iii) eliminate an H2 molecule forming thioformic acid; this channel is very
exothermic, but it is inhibited by the presence of a very high barrier associated with a
3-center elimination mechanism.
Alternatively, W1 can dissociate into products in barrierless channels where one of its
bonds smoothly weakens before breaking apart and forming iv) hydroxymethyl + SH if
the newly formed C−S bond breaks apart; v) CH2 OSH (P1) + H if the preexisting O−H
bond breaks apart (for the detailed structure of CH2 OSH see P1 in Figure 4); vi) CH2 SH

(sulfanylmethyl) + OH if the preexisting C−O bond breaks apart; vii) CHOHSH (P2) + H
if one of the preexisting C−H bonds breaks apart (for the detailed structure of CHOHSH
see P2 in Figure 4); viii) CH2 SOH (P3) + H if the newly formed S−H bond breaks apart
(see Figure 4 for the structure of P3). The last two channels are endothermic for the S(1 D)
+ CH3 OH reaction but are exothermic for the O(1 D) + CH3 SH (W1 can also be formed by
the insertion of O(1 D) into one of the C−H bonds of methanethiol).
The evolution of W2 is much simpler (see Figure 2, cyano lines). It either isomerizes to
W5 or W4 (by overcoming a barrier of 50 kJ/mol or 121 kJ/mol, respectively) or it dissociates
into CH3 + HOS by the breaking of the preexisting C−O bond or into CH3 OS (P4 in Figure
4) + H by the breaking of the preexisting O−H bond (however this last channel is significantly
endothermic). Finally, overcoming a significant barrier of 141 kJ/mol (TS7), W2 can evolve
toward CH4 and SO(a1 ∆) in a very exothermic channel. The associated TS7 suggests that
the methyl moiety abstracts an H atom from HOS while they separate. However, the barrier
is above the reactants energy and this channel is not expected to contribute appreciably. A
last possibility is associated with the formation of CH2 OHS (P5 in Figure 4) + H if one of
the preexisting C−H bonds breaks apart. This channel is endothermic by 299 kJ/mol and
is not shown in Figure 2.
The evolution of W4 and W5 is shown in Figure 3 (green lines and magenta lines, respectively). W5 (which can be formed directly by the insertion of S(1 D) into the O−H bond
of methanol or by the isomerization of W2) can: i) eliminate a molecule of hydrogen sulfide
forming formaldehyde; ii)-iii) eliminate an H2 molecule forming either HCOSH (P10 in Figure 4) or H2 COS (P11 in Figure 4), that is, two isomers of thioformic acid; the formation of
P10 is possible after overcoming the very high barrier associated with a 3-center elimination
mechanism (see TS16), while the 5-center elimination of H2 requires the overcoming of a
much smaller barrier (TS17).
Alternatively, W5 can dissociate into products in barrierless channels where one of its
bonds smoothly weakens before breaking apart and forming iv) methoxy + SH if the newly

formed O−S bond breaks apart; v) CH3 OS + H if the newly formed S−H bond breaks apart
(this channel is endothermic for the S(1 D)+H2 O reaction); vi) CH3 + HSO if the preexisting
C−O is broken; vii) CH2 OSH (P12, see Figure 4) + H if the preexisting C−H bond is broken.
W4 can, instead, i) eliminate a molecule of water forming thioformaldehyde; ii) eliminate an H2 molecule forming either H2 CSO(sulfinylmethane) or HCSOH (P8 in Figure 4),
two isomers of thioformic acid. Alternatively, W4 can dissociate into products in barrierless
channels where one of its bonds smoothly breaks apart, thus forming iv) CH3 S (Methylsulfanyl) + OH, v) CH3 + HOS, vi) CH3 SO (P6, Figure 4) + H, and vii) CH2 SOH (P9, Figure
4) + H.
3.2.2 The gas-phase O(1 D) + CH3 SH reaction
O(1 D) can a) insert into one of the C−H bonds of the methyl group of methanethiol forming
the W1 intermediate; b) add to one of the lone pairs of the sulfur atom of methanethiol
forming the W3 intermediate; c) insert into the S−H bond of methanethiol forming W4.
The evolution of W1 and W4 has already been commented on above, so only the pathways
originating from W3 are described here (see Figure 3).
The W3 intermediate formed by the addition of O(1 D) to the sulfur atom of methanethiol
is much more stable than W2 (the equivalent addition intermediate for the reaction S(1 D)
+ CH3 OH), being associated with a deep well of 281 kJ/mol rather than 132 kJ/mol as was
the case of W2 (maintaining S(1 D) + CH3 OH as the zero of energy). As in the case of W2,
isomerization to W4 and W5 are possible pathways via TS10 (located at - 327 kJ/mol with
respect to the O(1 D)+CH3 SH initial energy) and TS6 (located at - 308 kJ/mol). W4 and
W5 evolve in the same way described for the S(1 D)+CH3 OH reaction but the extra energy
of 226 kJ/mol can alter the relative product branching fractions (not derived here since they
are beyond the scope of this paper). W3 can also decompose into CH4 and SO(a1 ∆) via
TS11 (-186 kJ/mol, see the structure in Figure 4). Alternatively, it dissociates into CH3 SO
(Methylsulfinyl) + H by the breaking of the preexisting S−H bond in an exothermic O/H

exchange channel or into CH3 + HOS by the breaking of the preexisting C−S bond. Finally,
by the breaking of one of the preexisting C−H bonds, CH2 SHO (P7 in Figure 4) + H can
be formed.

3.3 RRKM branching fractions for the gas-phase S(1 D) + CH3 OH
reaction
In the case of the gas-phase S(1 D) + H2 O reaction, there is only one open channel and there
is no need to establish the product BFs. On the contrary, the reaction with CH3 OH is quite
complex as more than one intermediate can be formed by the initial approach of S(1 D) with
methanol and all of them have more than one open dissociation channel. For this reason, we
decided to analyze the reactive system with a statistical approach. Since it is impossible to
quantify how the reactive flux is distributed among W1, W2, and W5 without some strong
assumption, we preferred to follow the evolution of each initial intermediate separately. The
results are summarized in Table 2, while the unimolecular decomposition (or isomerization
when relevant) rate coefficients for W1 and W5 are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.
At all the energies considered, the dominant decomposing channels of W1 are those leading to CH2 OH + SH, H2 CO + H2 S, and H2 CS + H2 O. The rate constant of the second
H2 S elimination channel accompanied by the formation of hydroxycarbene is not negligible.
The rate constant for the CH2 SH + OH channel exhibits a strong increase with the total
energy but becomes significant only above 50 kJ/mol. All the other channels make a negligible contribution, including the back-dissociation to the reactants. The resulting BFs at 10,
100, and 300 K show a mild dependence on the temperature, with the BF of CH2 OH + SH
increasing with the increase of the available energy. These results might seem surprising, as
the barrierless channel leading to CH2 OH + SH (which is, actually, slightly dominant at all
the energies/temperatures investigated) is associated with a value of reaction enthalpy which
is much above the energy of the barriers associated with the H2 O and H2 S elimination channels (TS1 and TS2). However, the (quasi)formation of bimolecular products for monotonic

dissociation channels is entropically favored with respect to the case of well-defined TS with
only vibrational modes because, in the first case, some vibrations turn into quasi-internal
rotations and the density of states increases favoring the corresponding products. We remind
that a variational treatment of this channel will provide a more reliable rate constant and
that the present values should be seen only as upper bounds. However, we do not expect the
importance of this channel to be significantly reduced. At very low energies/temperatures, as
suggested by energetic considerations, the H2 CO + H2 S and H2 CS + H2 O channels become
as important as the CH2 OH + SH channel.
All the reactive flux associated with the formation of the W2 addition intermediate is
channeled into W5 since the other channels (including the isomerization to W4) cannot
compete. W5, in turn, dissociates almost exclusively into CH3 + HSO with a very small
yield for the CH3 O + SH channel. As visible in Figure 6, the rate constant for the CH3
+ HSO channel is dominant for all the energies considered. As a consequence, the BFs are
temperature-independent. All the other channels have a negligible BF, which is not surprising once considering the associated high energy barriers that make them non-competitive.
In conclusion, despite the complexity of the overall PES, just a few channels are important, and these are CH2 OH + SH, H2 CO + H2 S, H2 CS + H2 O, and CH3 + HSO.

the same system at the B3LYP/aug- cc-pV(T+d)Z level of theory. A similar picture emerged
from that work, but the energy levels are somewhat different because of the lower level of
theory employed. 91
We have chosen this approach to gain insight into the effect of the surrounding water
molecules but it is a very simplified version of the real conditions that will be typical in
the context of interstellar ice or atmospheric water droplets. Considering the S(1 D) addition
mechanism on the lone pair of the O atom, it is immediately evident that the presence of four
additional molecules significantly increases the stability of the addition intermediate (MIN14WMC) with respect to its reactants (here the zero energy corresponds to the separated
S(1 D) and the cluster of five water molecules) when compared to the case of the isolated
system (the energy levels, in this case relative to the S(1 D) + a single water molecule, are also
shown in Figure 7 in blue for a direct comparison). Such a stabilizing effect is minimal in the
case of MIN2-4WMC (-250 with respect to -244 kJ/mol) while it is null in the case of MIN34WMC (-171 wrt -170 kJ/mol).1 That simply means that the presence of four additional

water molecules might stabilize both the configuration of the reactants and that of the
intermediates at the same level. The large stabilization effect for the addition intermediate
MIN1-4WMC can be understood if one considers the H-bonds that the added sulfur can
form with another water molecule. A significant reduction of the relative energy of TS1 can,
instead, be explained by the fact that at least another water molecule participates in the
isomerization process. Similar effects are seen also for TS2/TS2-4WMC and MIN3/MIN34WMC.
However, the most significant effects are seen in other aspects of this reactive system.
First of all, we could not locate the transition state connecting MIN3-4WMC to the only
exothermic channel of the isolated S(1 D) + H2 O reaction, that is the channel leading to
SO(a1 ∆) + H2 . This can be easily rationalized by considering that the H2 elimination occurs via a 3-center mechanism that requires a huge distortion of the structure of MIN3. The
presence of H-bonds with the additional water molecules severely contrasts the necessary
distortion of MIN3-4WMC and the SO(a1 ∆) + H2 channel is not open in this case. Furthermore, MIN2-4WMC does not seem to undergo fission of the O−S bond toward OH + SH
because the H-bond structure of MIN2-4WMC would need to open up. Another interesting
effect is the inversion of stability for the two isomers HSO/HOS: in the presence of 4WMC,
the HOS moiety is able to establish much stronger H-bonds with its O-H termination with
respect to HSO where the H atom is bound to sulfur.
In conclusion, when considering the S(1 D) + H2 O reaction in the presence of four additional water molecules, the system does not have any two-product exothermic exit channel.
Therefore, our study indicates that either MIN1 or MIN2 will be stabilized in the ice or
liquid water matrices. Considering the relative stability, HOSH (hydrogen thioperoxide)
is expected to be the main product of the reaction when additional water molecules are
considered.

4.2 The S(1 D) + CH3 OH reaction in the presence of four water
molecules
Given the complexity of the S(1 D) + CH3 OH system, we could not perform electronic structure calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z level for the species of interest in the
presence of 4WMC. Therefore, we have derived the optimized structures and energies only
at the ωB97XD level. However, to check the accuracy of the calculations, we have computed
the energy of W1-4WMC also at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z and CBS levels. For the relative energy with respect to the reactants, we obtained the values -369, -355, -371 kJ/mol
at ωB97XD, CCSD(T) and CBS levels, respectively. This suggests that the ωB97XD level
of calculation is a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Also for
other systems, we have observed that ωB97XD can be preferred to CCSD(T) for some error
compensation. 92

In addition, we failed to locate any of the transition states seen for the isolated system.
The structures of the W1, W2, W3, W4, and W5 intermediates when interacting with four
additional water molecules are shown in Figure 8. All the other structures are shown in
Figure S2 of the SI; the energy values are shown in Table S4 of the SI.

S(1 D) + CH3 OH reaction in the presence of additional four water molecules. Bond lengths
are expressed in Angstrom. More details are available in the SI.
Considering what we have seen in the case of the S(1 D) + H2 O system, we can suggest that
all the exit pathways characterized by a significant energy barrier will be strongly inhibited
if an important distortion of the structure of the intermediates is necessary because of the
presence of stabilizing H-bonds with the additional water molecules. However, some TSs
could also be lowered if the water molecules help in the rearrangement (in particular, if the
water molecules participate in a proton transfer process).
Among the channels that are not characterized by an exit barrier, the channel that was
dominant for W1 in the gas phase (CH2 OH + SH) remains exothermic (see Table S3 in the
SI; we have considered two possibilities: either CH2 OH remains bound to the 4WMC and
SH is released in the gas phase or SH remains bound to the 4WMC and CH2 OH is lost: in
both cases, the ∆H0o remains negative being - 53 kJ/mol in the first case and -47 kJ/mol in

the second case) as well as the dominant CH3 +HSO channel for W5 (in this case only HSO4WMC + CH3 was considered since the binding energy of CH3 to water ice is quite small 93 ).
In general, the final outcome will depend on the capability of the initial intermediates (W1,
W2, and W5 for S(1 D) + CH3 OH; W1, W3, and W4 for O(1 D) + CH3 SH) to lose part
of the excess energy with which they are formed by the addition/insertion process via the
weak interactions with the surrounding water molecules. These processes might be very
fast as recently demonstrated by a theoretical approach based on molecular dynamics. 94,95
Therefore, even if we cannot exclude that the CH2 OH + SH (from W1) and CH3 +HSO (from
W5) two-product channels could have a certain yield, it is reasonable to assume that W1,
W2, and W5 (as well as W3 and W4 for the O(1 D) + CH3 SH reaction) will be stabilized as
such in the ice or liquid water matrix. A further observation could be that the CH2 OH +
SH channel from W1 might experience an unfavorable influence from the surrounding water
molecules as observed for the OH + SH channel in the reaction S(1 D) + H2 O, while the
elimination of the CH3 moiety from W5-4WMC with the production of HSO-4WMC should
not be hindered because of the small binding energy of CH3 . 93

5. Discussion
In previous work, we have already seen that S(1 D) has the capability of inserting into σ bonds
(see, for instance, the reaction S(1 D) + CH4 54 ) and adding to the π system of unsaturated
hydrocarbons (see the cases of S(1 D) + C2 H2 and C2 H4 51,52 ). In both systems investigated
here, we see that S(1 D) can also efficiently add to one of the lone pairs of oxygen. This
was already observed with another insertive species, namely N(2 D), as in its reaction with
H2 O and CH3 OH also the addition to the lone pair of atomic oxygen was observed 59,96,97 . It
is interesting to compare the N(2 D) reactions with those of S(1 D). In the case of N(2 D) +
H2 O, the characteristics of the PES are qualitatively very similar, but the reactive channels
leading to HNO + H, HON + H, and OH + NH are all exothermic. This diminishes

26

the importance of the H2 elimination channel which, indeed, was found not to occur. For
that system, a quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) investigation was pursued and the dynamical
description of the system was given. According to that study, the only fate of the H2 ON
addition intermediate is isomerization to the insertion intermediate HONH. The QCT results
also showed a marked deviation from the expected statistical behavior, posing a caveat to
the uncritical application of a statistical approach for small systems despite the presence of
deep energy wells along the minimum energy path. 59,96 In the case of the N(2 D) + CH3 OH
reaction, a PES was derived where only the insertion into one of the C−H bonds of methanol
or the addition to the lone pair of atomic oxygen were considered. 97 Similar exit channels
are also present (e.g. CH3 + HNO, CH3 O + NH, CH2 OH + NH). However, the statistical
estimate of BFs was not pursued and, therefore, we cannot compare the product branching
fractions. Furthermore, for that system, a small entrance barrier for the insertion mechanism
was identified. 97
To the best of our knowledge, no rate coefficients are available for the S(1 D) + H2 O and
S(1 D) + CH3 OH reactions. According to our calculations, they are expected to be fast, in
the gas kinetics limit as observed for many other S(1 D) reactions 52–54,98,99 because all the
barriers along the pathways of the main channels discussed above are below the energy of
the reactants. In the case of the reaction with H2 O, two TSs that must be overcome to
reach the only two-product open channel are very close to the energy of the reactants being
located at -13 (TS2) and - 10 (TS3) kJ/mol at the highest level of calculations employed.
Given the expected accuracy of the method (± 5 kJ/mol), both seem to lie below the zero
energy. In addition, our calculations derive an energy too high for the product asymptote, so
o
that, if there is an indication that comes from the comparison with known ∆H0,f
’s, 71,87 it is

that the energy of TS3 approximates the real one from above. Nevertheless, the presence of
high energy barriers could increase the rate of back-dissociation to the reactants thus partly
reducing the reactive flux toward product formation.
A final comment needs to be made about the occurrence of intersystem crossing to the

triplet PES. This is certainly a possibility because the presence of sulfur increases spin-orbit
coupling. While recent experiments on several reactions involving S-species proved the occurrence of ISC, 100–102 detailed observables from crossed molecular beam experiments on
the related O(3 P,1 D) + H2 S reactions could not identify any signature of the occurrence
of intersystem crossing 103,104 (as seen, instead, for other reactions involving O(3 P,1 D) and
investigated with the same experimental approach). 105–107 However, the significantly lower
amount of energy available to the S(1 D) + H2 O system with respect to O(1 D) + H2 S might
still increase the probability of ISC. In the models of cometary chemistry, physical quenching to S(3 P) via ISC has always been considered the only outcome for the S(1 D) + H2 O
collisions. 68–70 However, after contrasting indications, 98,99 the S(1 D) physical quenching does
not seem to be competitive with two-product reactions as recently demonstrated by CRESU
experiments on the S(1 D) + Ar collisions. 108 A conservative estimate of the rate coefficient
to be employed in the models of cometary chemistry could be in the 5 × 10−11 − 10−10 cm3
s−1 range in the 20 −300 K temperature range.
In the case of the reaction with methanol, instead, we expect a fast evolution toward the
products for any initial approach and the rate coefficient of S(1 D) + CH4 (ca. 2 × 10−10
cm3 s−1 in the range of temperature between 23 and 298 K) can be taken as a sort of lower
limit because methanol is a polar molecule. 54
Motivated by the deep wells associated with the reaction intermediates, we have also
scrutinized whether radiative association could occur for both the gas-phase S(1 D) + H2 O
and S(1 D) + CH3 OH reactions. We have employed the method developed by Herbst 109,110
Given the presence of exothermic two-product channels, radiative association did not result
to be competitive and cannot give an important contribution.
Concerning the implications in astrochemistry/cosmochemistry, we can conclude that
these reactions in the gas phase do not lead to an increased degree of complexity of Sbearing species. The reaction with water only leads to SO while the reaction with methanol
mostly converts S(1 D) into SH, H2 S and HSO with only a small fraction of the global yield

associated with H2 CS. Considering that most of S(1 D) is produced by the photodissociation
of CS2 , OCS, and H2 S we can conclude that it will be either recycled back to H2 S or actually
contribute to the loss of species holding a C−S bond. Interestingly, a recent analysis of SO
interferometric observations in Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) concluded that there must
be an additional source of SO since the photodissociation of SO2 alone cannot account for
the observed distribution. 111 This additional source has not been identified yet. Considering
the overwhelming abundance of water and all the sources of S(1 D) (most of which are not
properly included in the models yet), the S(1 D) + H2 O reaction could be the missing source
of SO. The gas-phase S(1 D) + CH3 OH reaction, instead, could be the source of the detected
HSO 28 (another important source could be the O(1 D) + H2 S reaction) 103,104 while for the
other main products (SH, H2 S, H2 O, H2 CO, CH2 OH, and H2 CS) there are other efficient
sources.
The situation is more interesting if we consider the possible outcome in the presence of ice.
In those cases, species like hydrogen thioperoxide, mercaptomethanol, methyl thioperoxide
(and methyl sulfenic acid in the case of the related O(1 D) + CH3 SH reaction) are formed.
These are singlet stable closed-shell species engaged in strong H-bonds with the water ice
matrix, which might survive for a long time and accumulate in the ice. In the presence
of a flux of H atoms (as in the case of interstellar ice) they do not undergo hydrogenation
while possible H-abstraction processes will cause the formation of radicals that will be easily
hydrogenated back (see, for instance, Ref. 112 ). These results could be of great importance in
interpreting what Rosetta recorded during the famous event of dust emission from comet 67P
on September 5, 2016. During this event, Rosetta was hit by a chunk of ice and dust that
increased locally the gas density. ROSINA recorded, in addition to the usual sulfur-bearing
species, a plethora of different molecules never seen before. The interpretation was that the
sublimation of semivolatile matter inside the equilibrium chamber of ROSINA (T= 273 K)
caused the increase of the signal of all the sulfur species already detected (only the signal
associated with OCS and CS2 did not increase during the event) and the appearance of new

species in the mass spectrum. Among them, molecules containing both sulfur and oxygen
(that can be described by the general formula Cn Hm Ol S, where n can vary between 0 and 3,
m between 0 and 6, and l between 1 and 2) were identified. In this group, there are SO, HSO,
H2 SO, and CH4 SO. It is not clear if these species were in the ice as such or if they originate
from the fragmentation of larger species. But certainly, the signal recorded at m/z= 50
(H2 SO+ ) or 49 (HSO+ ) can be associated with the electron impact ionization of HSOH,
while the signal attributed to species with gross formula CH4 SO (already identified also in
the quiet coma) can be associated with mercaptomethanol, methyl thioperoxide, and methyl
sulfenic acid formed in cometary ice. Finally, the record of SO with the same abundance
as SO2 (alleged to be its parent molecule) clearly indicates that there must be additional
sources of SO. Except for OCS, CHOS, CH4 OS, and CH3 O2 S, no other molecules holding O,
C, and S atoms were observed by the same instrument in the coma before the dust emission
event.

6. Conclusions
This work indicates that the collisions between S(1 D) and H2 O can be reactive since there
is an open channel whose pathway evolves via intermediates and transition states below the
reactants energy asymptote. To date, it has been included in the models of cometary comae
only as a process inducing physical quenching. This is similar to the case of other collisions
with water molecules, such as those of N(2 D) that still in recent works are considered to be
non-reactive while they easily lead to HNO + H and OH + NH. The S(1 D) + H2 O reaction
can be a prompt source of SO under the denser conditions of the coma, close to the nucleus.
The reaction with methanol does not seam to increase the degree of complexity of S-bearing
molecules when it occurs in the gas phase.
To simulate the two reactions occurring in ice or liquid water, we have also considered
them in the presence of four additional water molecules. The conclusion is that the initial

intermediates formed by the insertion or addition mechanism − namely HOSH (hydrogen
thioperoxide) and H2 OS for S(1 D) + H2 O and CH2 OHSH (mercaptomethanol), CH4 OS and
CH3 OSH (methyl thioperoxide) for S(1 D) + CH3 OH, as well as CH3 SOH (methyl sulfenic
acid) for O(1 D) + CH3 SH − will probably be stabilized by the interaction with surrounding
water molecules. Since this is an oversimplified model of ice, we are now pursuing a more
realistic characterization of the S(1 D) + H2 O reaction in ice by using the methodology
implemented by Rimola and coworkers (see, for instance, 113,114 ).
Our results can help in understanding the sulfur chemistry in space, especially in the case
of comets. On one side, the gas-phase reaction S(1 D) + H2 O could account for the additional
SO source necessary to explain its distribution in the Hale Bopp comet as resulting from
an interferometric investigation. On the other side, some of the S/O-containing molecules
identified by ROSINA during the enhanced dust emission events of the 67/P comet (e.g.
species with gross formula HSO, H2 SO, and CH4 OS) could be the results of the chemistry
occurring on ice that we have exposed in this work.
We urge modelers dealing with cometary chemistry to consider the reactive nature of
S(1 D) + H2 O (as well as that of N(2 D) + H2 O) in their models and to update the photodissociation schemes of S(1 D) mother molecules (especially H2 S and SO2 ) as recently established
by Cook et al. 40 and Chang et al. 42
