ABSTRACT
Scytonemin, a UV-protective pigment produced by cyanobacteria, is essential for microbial survival under extreme solar
radiation. Recent studies suggest its structural analog, scytonemin imine, may serve as a biosynthetic marker for cyanobacteria
exposed to intense light. Here, we present a structural revision, revealing scytonemin imine as a cyclic hydropyrrolo[2,3b]indole, rather than the previously proposed primary imine. This reassignment is supported by 1D and 2D NMR, Q-TOF
mass spectrometry, confirmatory synthesis, and DFT calculations. Our synthesis demonstrates that scytonemin converts to
scytonemin imine under mild conditions-ammonia and acetone exposure-suggesting the imine adduct is likely an artifact of
isolation. However, our findings also indicate that this artifact may reveal a previously unrecognized in-vivo state of scytonemin,
which is released upon condensation with acetone. This reactivity uncovers a new chromism within the scytonemin scaffold,
supporting the idea that biogenic scytonemin analogs may filter visible light to regulate photosynthesis and protect against
ROS-mediated photodamage during high light exposure or desiccation. This chromatic transformation highlights scytonemin’s
structural adaptability, offering insight into its role as a protective pigment in ancient and modern cyanobacteria and its relevance
for understanding microbial adaptation to extreme environments.

Introduction
The discovery and characterization of microbial pigments hold significant implications for understanding life’s resilience
on Earth and detecting potential biosignatures in extraterrestrial environments1, 2 Pigments such as scytonemin, mycosporinlike amino acids (MAAs), and lichen-derived acids, produced by extremophiles, play critical roles in survival mechanisms,
providing protection against UV radiation and oxidative stress3–6 . These compounds serve as multifunctional UV protectants
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, offering insights into microbial resistance and suggesting their potential as
biosignatures in astrobiology7, 8 . As such, pigments can serve as “smoking gun” indicators of life, particularly on planets
where conditions resemble early Earth. In astrobiology, the spectral signatures of pigments—detectable by technologies like
Raman spectroscopy—make them prime targets for remote sensing and in-situ analysis on planetary missions. However, a
nuanced understanding of both biotic and abiotic pigment origins and their reactivity is essential to avoid misinterpreting data,
especially in harsh environments like Mars. The evolving adaptability of microbial pigments to environmental stresses, such
as UV radiation and oxidative conditions, may offer clues to how life might survive on other worlds. Scytonemin (1) is a
microbial pigment that is implicated in UV protection of organisms that existed on early Earth (fig. 1)9, 10 . This pigment is
almost exclusively localized to the extracellular polysaccharide sheath (EPS) of cyanobacteria and possesses strong broadband
UV absorption and antioxidant properties6, 11–16 . The production of this pigment by the organism is highly inducible under UV
exposure and is replenished by cyanobacteria after selective extraction of the pigment from extracellular tissue17–19 . Scytonemin
(1) has been established as a key trait for survivability under prolonged exposure to lethal levels of UV light, and its production

is shared by many taxa of cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic estimates suggest that it was produced by crown species of cyanobacteria
at least 2.1 billion years ago20 . This body of evidence has led researchers to suggest that the pigment evolved on early Earth
cyanobacteria, and the redox and UVA/B absorption characteristics are likely why it persists in modern cyanobacteria. This has
prompted numerous chemical studies to search for related pigments across extremophilic cyanobacteria taxa, which might
provide insights into the characteristics of life that can resist intense UV radiation, similar to conditions on early Earth. However,
the isolation and characterization of these pigments can be highly challenging due to their low concentrations and complex
structures. For example, the structure of gloeocapsin, a red pigment from cyanobacteria, remains only tentatively assigned
despite its repeated discovery since 1877, highlighting the difficulties in fully characterizing pigments in these systems21 . Since
the structural elucidation of scytonemin (1) by Gerwick and Proteau in 1993, only a few structural analogs have been isolated
and characterized10, 22, 23 . Their origins have been suggested to arise from environmental stimuli, such as high levels of iron and
high incident light. One such structural analog, previously isolated and structurally assigned as scytonemin imine (2a), formally
constitutes an acetone imine conjugate of scytonemin (1,fig. 1). Scytonemin imine was first isolated in 2012 from Scytonema
hoffmani grown under high-intensity solar radiation (300–1500 µmol quanta m−2 s−1 and was proposed as a biosynthetic marker
for cyanobacteria grown under these conditions22 . However, it is well established that primary imines, such as the originally
proposed structure of scytonemin imine (2a), are highly unstable in aqueous conditions and would rapidly hydrolyze to the
corresponding ketone under the extraction and isolation conditions (not observed). Given this consideration, we re-isolated,
re-evaluated, and re-assigned the structure of scytonemin imine (2a) as the cyclic imine scytonemin hydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole
(2b) based on full characterization of this pigment by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis,
electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF MS), comparison to density functionalized theory
(DFT) calculations of 13 C and 1 H chemical shift values, and confirmatory total synthesis (fig. 1). Our synthetic studies show
that scytonemin (1) can convert into scytonemin imine (2b) by treatment with ammonia and acetone, indicating a previously
un-described chromism property of the scytonemin skeleton. This property may allow adaptation to different solar radiation
and regulate photosynthesis. While this conversion might not reflect the exact biogenic structure or origins of scytonemin imine
(2b), our findings suggest that the structural adaptability of scytonemin could predict how microbial life on other habitable
planets might accommodate rapidly changing environmental conditions, such as variations in light, atmospheric composition,
redox, and pH environments; factors that are essential to the resilience of life forms to survive extreme and changing conditions.
Our work emphasizes the importance of detailed chemical studies in understanding the ecological roles of pigments and their
relevance as biosignatures for astrobiological research. Understanding these mechanisms may shed light on the evolutionary
pressures that shaped life on early Earth and provide key insights into how similar life forms could exist on exoplanets.

Results
Re-isolation of scytonemin imine and confirmation of identical spectra
Scytonemin imine was extracted from commercially available Nostoc flagelliforme through continuous extraction of pulverized
dry cyanobacteria with acetone. Purification using preparatory thin-layer chromatography (prep-TLC on silica gel) led to the
isolation of a mahogany-colored compound, which exhibited the identical tandem LC-QTOF mass spectrometry characteristics,
FT-IR, and UV-Vis spectra as previously reported (Figure 1 and SI). UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis showed that the re-isolated
scytonemin imine exhibited the identical high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) molecular ion [m/z = 602.2074, calcd’ for
C39 H28 N3 O4 [M+H]+ , found 602.2085] major fragment corresponding to the neutral loss of acetone imine [m/z = 545.1496,
([M-H]+ -(C3 H7 N)], indicating that the scytonemin imine originally reported by Grant and Louda had been re-isolated. 1D and
2D NMR analysis (900 MHz, DMSO-d6 ) revealed the characteristic diastereotopic methylene doublets (δ H 3.71 and 3.24,
J = 18.9 Hz, δ C 54.0) that were also reported previously and assigned to the α-position (C-17) of the acetone imine adduct.
In addition to these diagnostic signals, the resonances of the aromatic protons, 4-exchangeable protons (singlets, δ H 11.94,
10.24, 10.16, and 6.86), and a methyl singlet (δ H 1.91, δ C 19.9) were all consistent with the previously isolated compound
named scytonemin imine. However, the hydrolytic instability of the primary imine functionality of the reported structure of
scytonemin imine 2a, reevaluation of the 1D and 2D NMR data, and computational analysis revealed significant inconsistencies
with the originally proposed structure of scytonemin imine 2b and prompted the reevaluation of the structure.
Key 1D and 2D NMR re-evaluation leading to the revision of the structure of scytonemin imine
Our structural reassignment first focused on the C-1—C-19 indoline core, which contains the acetone imine motif that
distinguishes scytonemin imine. Key (1 H→13 C) heteronuclear multi-bond coupling (HMBC) between the H-17 diastereotopic
proton resonances (δ H 3.71 and 3.24, J = 18.9 Hz, δ C 54.0 ppm) and the H-19 methyl group (δ H 1.91, δ C 19.9) to the
C-18 imine resonance (δ C 173.1) support an acetone imine-derived functionality (fig. 2). However, further examination of
the HMBC correlations and 13 C chemical shift values at the C-3a and C-8b positions supported an alternative connectivity
of a cyclic imine structure, scytonemin hydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole 2b (fig. 2). The strongest experimental evidence for this
rearranged connectivity was provided by HMBC correlations between the diastereotopic methylene resonances of C-17 and
2/15

the indoline carbon C-8a (δ C 133.6), as well as shared correlations between H-5 of the indoline (δ H 6.52, δ C 109.9) and
C-8b (δ C 62.2). Additionally, chemical shift values for C-3a (δ C 104.8) are more consistent with an N,N-substituted carbon
rather than a quaternary nitrogen carbon as previously assigned (δ C 63.5). We have reassigned this δ C 62.2 resonance to
C-8b based on the revised HMBC couplings. Additional HMBC correlations also allowed us to assign the exchangeable
protons and further support the connectivity of the imine. The exchangeable 1 H resonance at 11.9 ppm was assigned to the
indole N(1’)-H, supported by HMBC couplings to C-3’a (δ C 149.2), C-8’a (δ C 126.4), and C-8’b (δ C 123.2). The remaining
indoline N(1)H proton was assigned to the exchangeable 1 H resonance at 6.86 ppm, which exhibited HMBC couplings to the
quaternary bridgehead C-3a (δ C 104.8) and C-8b (δ C 62.2), as well as to the C-4a indole carbon (δ C 149.7). Considering an
alternative isomer of scytonemin hydropyrrolo[3,2-b]indole 2c, where the C3a-C8b connectivity is reversed, was found to be
inconsistent with the expected chemical shift for a C-8b connection (δ C > 70) and the observed HMBC correlations, supporting
the connectivity of 2b over 2c. Additionally, the large geminal coupling constant value between C17 hydrogens (J = 18.9 Hz)
is consistent with values the C2 methylene of 1,3-cyclopentadieneone24 . A literature search identified one structure with the
overall hydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole motif, assigned to alstrobrogaline (3), as well as related cyclic pyrrolidine compounds with
diastereotopic methylene resonances for comparison of the 2 J geminal 1 H coupling and 13 C NMR chemical shift data (fig. 2,
right)25–27 . The overall consistency of 13 C chemical shift values between the alkaloid alstrobrogaline (3) and the large geminal
J values of other cyclic pyrrolidine diastereotopic methylenes were consistent with the revised scytonemin imine indoline core
of scytonemin hydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole 2b. Further assignment of the structure of 2b based on 1D and 2D NMR analysis
was consistent with the remaining structural elements of the scytonemin core (table 1). The stereochemistry of the styrenyl
units was assigned based on NOESY correlations between the indoline NH and the C-11/15 aromatic protons, and the indole
NH with C-11’/15’ protons, which supports the configuration of both styrenyl units and reinforces our assignment of the NH
protons. Unfortunately, the very small amount of material (200-300 µg) we were able to isolate limited the signal intensity in
the 13 C NMR data.
DFT calculations further supporting the revised structure of scytonemin imine (2b)
To further evaluate our structural reassignment, we performed DFT calculations of the 13 C and 1 H chemical shifts of the
originally proposed acyclic imine 2a, the revised cyclic imine 2b, and an isomeric cyclic imine 2c. The optimized geometries
in DMSO were obtained using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). Clear inconsistencies between the
calculated and experimental 13 C NMR spectra are observed within the imine functionalized indoline core of the originally
proposed structure of scytonemin imine 2a (fig. 3, RMSD = 17.9 ppm and MAE = 9.74 ppm). The calculated 1 H and 13 C
chemical shifts for the revised cyclic scytonemin imine 2b are consistent with the experimental spectra, with only minor
discrepancies (fig. 3, 13 C: R2 = 0.9924, RMSD = 3.13 ppm, MAE = 1.97 ppm, 1 H: R2 = 0.9941, RMSD = 0.246 ppm, MAE =
0.11 ppm). The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of isomeric structure 2c, with the cyclic imine unit connected through C-3a/C-8b,
was also calculated and compared to experimental data (fig. 3). The experimental and calculated 1 H and 13 C NMR chemical
shift values for the isomeric cyclic imine 2c are more consistent than those for the originally proposed structure 2a. However,
significant differences between the calculated and experimental values are observed for the key C-8b 13 C chemical shift (δ ∆ =
-20.6 ppm) in isomer 2c, along with a lower overall agreement between the calculated and experimental 13 C chemical shifts for
2c (fig. 3, R2 = 0.9856, RMSD = 4.27 ppm, and MAE = 2.24 ppm). These discrepancies further support the assignment of
scytonemin imine as 2a. Overall, the strong evidence from HMBC correlations, along with the support from computational
modeling, corroborate our revised structure for scytonemin imine as 2b.
A confirmatory synthesis of scytonemin and conversion to scytonemin imine
To evaluate the newly proposed structure and the relationship between scytonemin and scytonemin imine, we pursued a concise
total synthesis of scytonemin and ultimately scytonemin imine 2b. Tryptophan (4) was efficiently converted to the trifluoro
oxazolone 5 using trifluoroacetic anhydride in ether28 . Friedel-Crafts cyclization using AlCl3 provided the trifluoroacetamide 6,
which was efficiently oxidized using copper (II) bromide to the diketone 7(fig. 4)29 . Selective addition of the Grignard to the
C-3 ketone provided a mixture of the tertiary alcohol 9 and desired monomer 8, which the alcohol could be further converted to
the alkene under mild conditions. We expect that the selective addition of the benzyl Grignard was supported by enolization
of the C-2 ketone by an equivalent of the organometallic reagent. Dimerization of the monomer 8 was completed following
similar conditions to the Mårtensson group to form the doubly reduced dimethoxy scytonemin 10, which was deprotected
using BBr3 and oxidized using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) to form scytonemin (1)30 . The relationship
between scytonemin (1) and scytonemin imine (2a) suggests a reaction of the oxidized form of scytonemin with ammonia
and acetone by nucleophilic attack at the C-3b and C-8b positions. Treatment of scytonemin (1) with aqueous ammonia in
acetone produced scytonemin imine (2a) that demonstrated identical spectroscopic data to the isolated sample, thereby further
confirming our structural reassignment. With the material accessed by synthesis, we were able to assign the additional carbon
resonances that were undetectable in the isolated sample. Additionally, our studies revealed a dramatic solvent dependence

on both the chemical shift and broadness of the 1 H NMR resonances, specifically related to the H11’/H15’ AB quartet of the
para-substituted phenol, which is a newly observed solvatochromic behavior for the scytonemin scaffold (Figure S?).
Extraction experiments to evaluate the biogenic origins of scytonemin imine (2a)
Given the facility by which scytonemin (1) is converted to scytonemin imine (2b) we conducted control experiments to evaluate
the biogenic origins of scytonemin imine (2b). Ground tissue was subjected to extraction with acetonitrile, acetone, and
acetone-d6 and analyzed using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Acetonitrile extracts did not provide detectable quantities of scytonemin
imine (2b) and resulted in the detection of scytonemin (1). Analysis of the acetone and acetone-d6 extracts revealed detectable
signal for scytonemin imine (2b) and a deuterium enriched analog, suggesting that the origins of hydropyrrolo[2,3-b] moiety to
be associated with the acetone extraction solvent.

Discussion
Our results provide strong evidence for the structural reassignment of scytonemin imine as the hydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole
(2b). This reassignment is supported by spectroscopic analysis and the comparison of calculated NMR and UV-Vis spectra.
Additionally, the confirmatory total synthesis of scytonemin imine (2b) via a condensation reaction demonstrates that scytonemin
(1) readily converts to the imine in the presence of ammonia and acetone. Furthermore, our control extraction experiments
suggest that the extraction solvent is likely the source of the carbon portion of the imine moiety. Acetone is widely recognized
as an effective solvent for extracting scytonemin pigments from cyanobacterial tissue. However, our control experiments and
synthetic studies suggest that scytonemin imine (2b) may be an artifact of the isolation process. These results demonstrate that
ammonia and acetone readily convert scytonemin (1) into scytonemin imine (2b), though the precise mechanism remains unclear.
One possibility is that nucleophilic attack on the scytonemin skeleton occurs via an enamine or ketimine intermediate, formed
by the condensation of ammonia and acetone during extraction yielding scytonemin hydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole (2b,fig. 5).
The susceptibility of scytonemin (1) in its oxidized form to nucleophilic attack in its oxidized form suggests that it may be
covalently linked to biomolecules within the exopolysaccharide (EPS) sheath, where it has been established to co-localize
with Water Stress Protein A (WSPa) and other biomolecules due to its high lipophilicity11, 31–34 . A potential scytonemin
imine precursor could be covalently bound to an EPS biomolecule, such as an amino glycoside and/or a peptide/protein, and
exchange upon treatment with acetone. Though there is no confirmed evidence of the presence of a scytonemin derivative
of this type, Louda and Grant reported a polar HPLC peak that eluted earlier than scytonemin (1) and the imine (2b) that
demonstrated similar UV-Vis absorption characteristics to scytonemin imine (2a), though its low abundance hindered full
characterization. During our own isolation of scytonemin imine (2b), we observed evidence suggesting acetone reacts with
a more polar scytonemin derivative. LC-Q-TOF analysis of preparative TLC (SiO2 ) fractions identified a polydeuterated
derivative of 2b after this band was taken up into acetone-d6 for 1 H NMR analysis. This derivative exhibited neutral loss of
the ketimine, with the highest deuterium distribution within this fragment, supporting its formation during acetone treatment.
However, its low abundance precluded full structural characterization by NMR. Regardless of the precise mechanistic origins,
the presence of scytonemin imine (2a), whether as a biogenic or a partial isolation artifact, our re-isolation and chemical
synthesis indicates a facile mode of reactivity for the oxidized form of scytonemin (1). This reactivity, revealed through
the formation of the acetone adduct, also uncovers a novel chromism of scytonemin. Louda and Grant have postulated that
scytonemin imine (2b) could function as a visible light screen, absorbing key bands of photosynthetically active light at the
α/β bands of the cytochromes (531-532 nm and 560-562 nm) and the Soret bands of both the cytochromes and chlorophyl-a
(450 nm)22 . This chromism could serve as a protective mechanism, slowing photosynthesis by filtering PAR and preventing
photodamage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during periods of high light intensity and desiccation35–37 . Additionally,
our research points to the solvatochromatic properties of syctonemin imine, which could provide additional ecologically relevant
chromism for the scytonemin imine and related molecules, and demonstrate that the chromaphore is highly sensitive to the
environment. Ongoing research is aimed at identifying other scytonemin analogs, understanding their photochemical behaviors,
and their ecological relevance to scytonemin-producing cyanobacteria. In conclusion, microbial pigments like scytonemin offer
valuable insights into the survival mechanisms of extremophiles and their potential as biosignatures in astrobiological research.
These pigments, which function as both UV protectants and reactive oxygen species scavengers, demonstrate the evolutionary
adaptations that allowed life to persist under extreme conditions on early Earth. The spectral properties of pigments such as
scytonemin, detectable via advanced technologies like Raman spectroscopy, make them ideal candidates for remote sensing
in planetary exploration missions. However, the complexity of these pigments—arising from their low concentrations and
intricate structures—poses significant challenges for isolation and characterization. The re-isolation and re-characterization
of scytonemin imine, along with the revised structural assignment, highlights the chemical adaptability of scytonemin. Our
findings suggest that scytonemin’s conversion to scytonemin imine under simple conditions such as exposure to ammonia and
acetone points to a previously unrecognized chromism property, allowing this pigment to adapt to varying solar spectra. This
adaptability might offer important clues about how microbial life on other habitable planets could survive under fluctuating

environmental conditions, such as changes in light, atmospheric composition, redox states, and pH levels. By deepening
our understanding of the structural and functional properties of these pigments, we not only expand our knowledge of life’s
resilience but also enhance the search for biosignatures on exoplanets. The chemical studies of scytonemin and its analogs
emphasize the broader ecological roles of microbial pigments and their potential in guiding future astrobiological discoveries.

Methods
Extraction and re-isolation of scytonemin imine
The compound was isolated from a dried sample of Nostoc flagelliforme. Biomass purchased was sold as fat choy (Asian Mart,
Reno, NV) and was extracted without further treatment. 120 grams dry biomass was ground up using mortar and pestle. Sample
was extracted three times overnight with acetone at room temperature with continuous stirring. Extracts were combined and
dried in-vacuo. The resulting crude extract (60 mg) was subjected to preparative thin-layer chromatography (silica gel 60, 20
cm x 20 cm, 1000 µm) with a 45:55 acetone:hexane mobile phase. This resulted in a prominent mahogany red band which was
recovered from the silica gel stationary phase with acetone. This fraction was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a
Sephadex LH-20 (Supleco) column with acetone mobile phase. Chromatographic parameters: bed volume = 50 mL, column
height = 14.5 cm, internal diameter = 2.1 cm, flow rate = 17.3 mL/hr, linear flow rate = 5 cm/hr. 10 fractions of volumes 12, 14,
13, 8, 14, 14, 16, 17, 16 and 18 mL respectively were collected; of which fractions 6 and 7 yielded 300 µg of scytonemin
imine. These fractions were combined and dried in-vacuo for subsequent analyses. For confirmatory small scale extractions,
separate 100 mg samples of ground biomass were extracted in 5 mL of acetonitrile, acetone and acetone-d6 for 24 hr at room
temperature under continuous stirring. Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis by filtering 1 mL of each extracts
through a membrane filter (0.45 µm), drying in-vacuo and redissolving in 10 mL acetonitrile.
Spectroscopic Analysis
UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS Analysis Extracts were injected (10.00 µL) on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UPLC equipped with a
binary pump, temperature controlled multisampler (4 ◦ C), temperature controlled column compartment (40 ◦ C) and diode array
UV/Vis detector (λ = 190-800 nm), coupled to an Agilent 6560 Ion Mobility Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (IM-QTOF) mass
spectrometer via a Jet Stream electrospray ionization source (ESI-TOF; gas temperature: 300 ◦ C, flow: 11 L/m; nebulizer
pressure: 35 psig; sheath gas temp: 300 ◦ C; sheath gas flow: 12 L/m; VCap: 3500 V; nozzle voltage: 500V; fragmentor: 350 V;
skimmer: 65 V; octopole: 750 V). For LC-MS/MS, data were collected in positive data-dependent MS/MS mode with collision
energies set to 20 and 40 eV per duty-cycle and for LC-TOF, samples were re-run in 4-bit multiplexed IM-TOF mode at 1
frame/s. Multiplexed ion mobility spectra were demultiplexed using the PNNL ion mobility pre-processor,38 and spectra were
calibrated to reference mass standards for collisional-cross-section (Ω, Å2 ) determinations. All organic solvents and mobile
phase modifiers were Fisher Optima grade. Mobile phase solvents consisted of 18 MΩ water (solvent A) and 99% acetonitrile
(aq, solvent B), both modified by adding 0.1% formic acid. Reverse-phase (RP) chromatography was conducted using an
Agilent Poroshell EC-C18 column (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.9 µm). The RP gradient for both solvent compositions (0.4 mL/min) began
with initial conditions of 20% B, ramp to 100%B (0-15 min), ramp to 20% B (15-16 min), recondition column at 20% B (16 min
– 18 min). Scytonemin (C36 H20 N2 O4 , 8.86 min; Ω = 245.3 Å2 ; m/z = 545.1486 Da [M+H]+ , -1.8 ppm) and scytonemin imine
(C39 H28 N3 O4 , 6.10 min; Ω = 257.1 Å2 ; m/z = 602.2085 Da [M+H]+ , +1.8 ppm) were both observed in cyanobacterial extracts.
1D and 2D NMR analysis For the re-isolated scytonemin imine (2b), 1 H and 13 C NMR data were acquired on a Bruker Advance
III HD 900 MHz NMR equipped with a CNH cryoprobe. 1 H and 13 C NMR data for synthetic samples and intermediates were
acquired using a NAME 500 MHz or a 400 MHz NAME equipped with a NAME probe at 300K, and calibrated to residual
protonated. Chemical shift values are in CDCl3 are reported relative to SiMe4 (δ H 0 ppm) as an internal standard for 1 H, and
referenced to the residual solvent signal for 13 C (δ C 77.25). Chemical shifts in acetone-d6 and DMSO-d6 were referenced to
the residual protonated solvent signal for 1 H NMR [δ H = 0.0 ppm (acetone-d6 ) and δ H = 0.00 ppm(DMSO-d6 ] and 13 C NMR
[δ C = 0.0 ppm (acetone-d6 ) and δ C = 0.00 ppm (DMSO-d6 )]. Parameters for the 1D and 2D NMR experiments are reported in
the supporting information along with copies of the NMR spectra.
DFT calculations
The equilibrium geometries of 2a, 2b, 2c, and reduced scytonemin were obtained using the unrestricted B3LYP functional
and the def2-SVP basis set. All four geometries were optimized in gas phase as well as in acetone, acetonitrile, and DMSO.
To simulate the solvent environments, the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) was used. The optimized
geometries were confirmed to correspond to minima on the potential energy surfaces by performing the vibrational analysis.
The 1H and 13 C NMR chemical shifts were calculated in acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) using the revTPSS functional
in combination with the pcSseg-2 basis set.39, 40 The UV-Vis and CD spectra were calculated in ace-tonitrile using the B3LYP
functional and def2-TZVP basis set. All electronic structure calculations were performed with the ORCA 5.0 electronic
structure package.41

4-(1H-Indol-3-ylmethyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-5(4H)oxazolone (5) 28

Tryptophan (10.2 g, 50 mmol) was added to trifluoroacetic anhydride (16.6 mL, 120 mmol) in ether (100 mL) at 0 ◦C during
which an exothermic reaction was initiate. The reaction was allowed to re-cool upon which time it was removed from the ice
