Conspectus:
Reactions of gas phase molecules with
surfaces play key roles in atmospheric
and environmental chemistry. Reactive
uptake coefficients (γ), the fraction of
gas-surface collisions that yield a
reaction, are used to quantify the kinetics
in these heterogeneous and multiphase
systems. Unlike rate coefficients for
homogeneous gas or liquid phase
reactions, uptake coefficients are
emergent quantities that depend upon a
multitude of underlying elementary
steps. As such, uptake coefficients adopt
complex scaling behavior with reactant concentrations and other physicochemical properties of
the interface, making predictions of γ particularly challenging.
Typically, γgas is obtained by measuring the loss rate of a gas phase molecule above a liquid or
solid surface relative to its collision frequency. By definition, γgas ≤ 1. Highly efficient reactions
proceed at or near the gas-surface collision frequency and exhibit values of γgas near unity.
Alternatively, heterogeneous kinetics are often measured using the consumption rate of a
condensed phase reactant normalized to the gas-surface collision frequency, yielding instead an
effective uptake coefficient (γeff). In many cases, γeff and γgas are not equal, yielding additional
insights into the nature of the reaction. For example, substantial diffusive limitations in the
condensed phase may inhibit reactivity, yielding γeff << γgas. In contrast, γeff > γgas in the presence
of condensed phase secondary reactions, with values of γeff often exceeding 1 for the case of radical
chain reactions.
In this account, we will discuss how measurements of γeff in aerosol reveal the origins of complex
physical and chemical behavior in multiphase reactions that can be uniquely observed and
understood through the lens of effective uptake coefficients. For example, the scaling of γeff with
water vapor in aqueous systems, or shell thickness in core-shell aerosol, yields insight into relative
transport and reaction timescales of gaseous oxidants, while the scaling of γeff with oxidant and
trace gas concentrations provides a distinctive signature of the underlying competition between

free radical propagation and termination mechanisms. Further, changes in γeff induced by careful
selection of the molecular structure of the condensed-phase reactants help identify new reaction
pathways and indirectly report on the reaction kinetics of short-lived species, including Criegee
Intermediates. Through these examples we will show how proper experimental design and accurate
measurements of an effective uptake coefficient can be used to interrogate complex multiphase
reaction mechanisms.

Introduction
Multiphase reactions are often quantified in terms of a reactive uptake coefficient (𝛾). 𝛾 is
defined as the net loss of gas-phase molecules entering the condensed phase, divided by their
collision rate with the surface.1,2 This definition developed in the context of reactions on aqueous
interfaces, e.g. cloud droplets in the atmosphere, by expanding on notions of mass accommodation
coefficients (𝛼).3,4 Measuring 𝛾 can be straightforward for many reaction systems, such as by use
of a Knudsen cell or coated flow tube, given that it only requires monitoring relative changes in
the flux of gas and not absolute concentrations,1 and thus can account for the effects of evaporation,
desorption, diffusion, and reaction.5
However, interpreting the physical meaning of 𝛾 has been shown to be an increasing
challenge over several decades of measurement and analysis. For aerosol reactions, simple
frameworks, such as the resistor model,4 which assumes that the particle is well-mixed and all
processes contributing to gas uptake are independent, often break down when applied to systems
where reaction and diffusion are strongly coupled.6,7 As attention in aerosol research has shifted
toward particles of primarily organic constituents, such descriptions of the kinetics have been
stretched to the edges of their useful working ranges8 for organic aerosols with semisolid and
highly viscous phase states, in which high concentrations and slow mixing of reactants prove
troublesome for analysis in terms of limiting kinetic cases.9,10 Additionally, for reactions involving
gas-phase radicals, 𝛾 is often hard to measure, as radical concentrations are generally low, difficult
to detect, and can induce significant amounts of chemistry in the particle phase that is not directly
reflected in gas-phase measurements.

Alternately, heterogeneous reactions on aerosols with primarily organic constituents can
be described in terms of the effective uptake coefficient, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 , defined as the consumption rate of
a condensed-phase reactant relative to the collision rate of the impinging gas (Figure 1).11 In such
a measurement (typically by an aerosol mass spectrometer), the collision rate of a trace gas with
the particle surface is used as a clock against which the reaction time can be measured. For an
aerosol with an arbitrary condensed-phase reactant R undergoing reaction with a gas X, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 is
defined in terms of the loss of R,

Figure 1. Schematic illustrating the effects of chain cycling chemistry on the measurement of 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠
and 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 .
Since 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 is measured from the perspective of the condensed phase reactant, it is often not
equivalent to the uptake coefficient measured from the gas phase (𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠 , Figure 1). For example, in
the presence of diffusive limitations, which inhibit reaction, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 ≪ 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠 , or when secondary
reactions in the condensed phase provide additional sinks for reactants, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 > 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠 , potentially
exceeding unity, such as in the case of radical chain reactions with long chain lengths. 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠 , in
contrast, cannot exceed 1 by definition. Thus, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 is an emergent property of each reaction system,
and through careful measurement and interpretation can be used to interrogate multiple facets of a
multiphase reaction mechanism.
In the following Account, we will discuss the versatility of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 as an experimental
observable by examining its role in our group’s studies of model organic aerosols under laboratory
conditions (e.g., in flow tube reactors). These measurements under controlled conditions
demonstrate how 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 can report on diffusion coefficients and the timescales of reactant mixing in
semisolid aerosol,12–14 elucidate competitions between radical propagation and termination
mechanisms in chemical reactions,11,15–17 and help identify new chemical mechanisms involving

measurements of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 can be applied to the chemistry of atmospheric particles and other systems
of interest.

Organic aerosols in the atmosphere can exist in a wide variety of phase states, with particle
viscosities ranging from liquid to semisolid (tar-like) and solids,10,21–23 and recent studies have
emphasized how phase state can determine both the transport of gaseous reactants into aerosol
particles and the mixing behavior of the particle constituents themselves. Determining the

characteristic length- and timescales that govern transport and mixing can be experimentally
challenging, especially when these processes are inextricably linked with particle-phase chemical
reactions. However, given proper experimental technique, measurements of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 can be used to
quantify key transport parameters in aerosol particles.

One such technique was demonstrated by Lee et al.,12 who generated core-shell aerosols
with cores of trans-aconitic acid (an unsaturated tricarboxylic acid, Figure 2) that react with a
known rate (𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 = 𝛾0) upon exposure to ozone (O3). The reactive cores were coated with a thin
layer of lipid-like, liquid organic, creating a phase-separated shell whose thickness could be
determined within ±1 nm by particle size measurements. Depending on whether the shell was a
saturated hydrocarbon (Squalane (Sqa), C30H62) or an unsaturated hydrocarbon (Squalene (Sqe),
C30H50), an O3 molecule colliding with the particle surface would be subject to either diffusion
(Figure 2A) or both diffusion and reaction (Figure 2B) as it transits through the shell, increasing
the time required to reach and react with the core. As the shell thickness was increased from 0 up

to 12 nm, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 for the aconitic acid core was observed to decrease, and the barrier coefficient (the
ratio of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 to the 𝛾0 of the uncoated core) was plotted as a function of coating thickness (Figure
3).
Since the particle morphology and coating thicknesses were known, each set of barrier
coefficients in Figure 3 could be fit using a single parameter related to the transport of O3 through
the shell. In the case of aerosol with purely diffusive shells (Figure 2A), the decrease in 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 is
directly related to the diffusion coefficient, 𝐷𝑂3 , of ozone in Squalane, with a value of 𝐷𝑂3 =
1.6x10-6 cm2 s-1 estimated by fitting. However, in the case of reactive-diffusive shells (Figure 2B),
the transit time through the shell additionally depends on the chemical lifetime of O3 in Squalene,
estimated by 𝜏𝑟𝑥𝑛 = 1/𝑘𝑆𝑞𝑒 [𝑆𝑞𝑒]0 . The relative effects of both diffusion and reaction can be
expressed as one parameter, the reacto-diffusive length 𝐿𝑂3 = √𝐷𝑂3 𝜏𝑟𝑥𝑛 . This length is the average
distance an O3 molecule diffuses in the shell before reacting with an Sqe molecule, with the fitted
value of L = 1.03 nm corresponding roughly to the e-folding thickness of the barrier coefficient in
Figure 3. Additionally, by assuming that the value of 𝐷𝑂3 is the same for both shell types, the
chemical lifetime of O3 in Sqe was found to be on the order of 7 ns. Thus, by analyzing how 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓
is modulated, the transport properties of a gaseous reactant could be investigated even when
reaction and diffusion are coupled.

+ OH radical oxidation (panels A-D). Adapted from Davies et al.13 with permission from the
PCCP Owner Societies.
While this phase-separated system proved useful for controlled experiments, another
challenge lies in understanding how reactivity changes when the particle phase state is in a
transitional regime, for example beginning in a solid or semi-solid state and becoming more liquidlike.6,7,13 Davies et al. explored such a transition by reacting submicron citric acid (CA) aerosol
with gas-phase hydroxyl radicals (OH) in a flow tube reactor (Figure 2C).13 CA is a hygroscopic,
amorphous solid whose viscosity depends on the relative humidity (RH): below 50% RH, CA is a
diffusion-limited semi-solid, while at 50% RH and above, CA aerosols behave like well-mixed
aqueous solutions. From the known viscosity at each RH, a self-diffusion coefficient of CA (𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑔 )
can be estimated using the Stokes-Einstein relation.
The decay kinetics of CA upon OH exposure were then monitored using mass
spectrometry. 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 was calculated under each set of conditions, showing an expected dependence
on RH (Figure 4A), and therefore on 𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑔 (Figure 4B): below 50% RH, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 increases with

increasing diffusion rates, reaching an inflection point at 50% RH. Beyond 50% RH, the dilution
effect of added water leads to a decrease in uptake. However, the reacto-diffusive length of OH in
the CA aerosol yields is calculated to be less than 1 nm over all values of 𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑔 , indicating that the
reaction takes place primarily at the particle surface. Surface-sensitive measurements supported
this conclusion, as the reaction kinetics in the near-surface region appeared well-mixed at all RH
values, while whole-particle measurements indicated a fraction of the aerosol remained unreacted
below 50% RH.
These results are explained using an accessible-volume model, which relates 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 to the
reaction depth, L (Figure 2C), which is the depth of a surface shell of the particle in which the CA
appears well-mixed on the timescale of OH reaction. By fitting this model to the observed values
of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 , values of L can be found as a function of RH (Figure 4C). Similar to a reacto-diffusive
length, L is roughly proportional to the square root of 𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑔 (red line, Figure 4D) until L exceeds
the particle radius (Rp) and the entire particle is well-mixed and available for reaction. However,
instead of the transport of the gas-phase reactant limiting the reaction as with core-shell aerosols,
it is the timescale of CA diffusion in the particle phase, which controls its ability to replenish the
surface region and therefore controls value of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 . These experiments nicely illustrate how 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓
encodes information about the transport timescales of not only incoming gas-phase reactants, but
also the subsurface mixing time of particle phase reactants.
In addition to directly modulating the uptake, varying transport times can also have indirect
effects on the reactivity in complex reactions. Houle et al.14 conducted detailed reaction-diffusion
simulations of the OH oxidation of hydrocarbons under various diffusion limitations and showed
that characteristic length scales can exist for individual particle-phase reaction steps. When
diffusive limitations restrict the mobility of particle-phase reactants to within these characteristic

lengths, changes can occur in the reaction mechanism. While further work is still needed to extend
these methods to the complex behavior observed in atmospheric organic aerosol, measurements of
𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 can provide mechanistic insight into how transport and reaction are coupled together across
phases.

Insights into Competing Mechanisms During Radical Reactions
We turn now to a more explicit treatment of the relationship between 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 and chemistry
in the particle phase, where reactions between free radicals and organic molecules often involve
complex mechanisms with many competing processes (Scheme 1). After the reaction is initiated
by an incoming radical abstracting a hydrogen atom from a C–H bond (Reaction R1), the reaction
can either propagate, by forming new radical species that are in turn capable of H-abstraction, or
terminate through radical-radical recombination reactions. To understand the behavior of these
radical mechanisms under a variety of conditions, one must inquire as to the key steps and species
responsible for propagating the radical chain chemistry, as well as the major reactions which
compete with each of these steps. Measurements of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 are uniquely suited to address these
questions since values of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 > 1 are clear signatures of radical chain chemistry. Thus, by
examining how 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 scales with the concentrations of key reactants, crucial mechanistic steps can
be inferred.

Scheme 1. Summary of the radical-initiated reaction pathways discussed in this section. The
“resources” at the heart of the key kinetic competition in each example are highlighted and colorcoded.
For example, Richards-Henderson et al. examined reactions of OH radicals with aerosols
composed of alkanes, particularly Sqa.15,16 Under atmospheric conditions, where molecular
oxygen (O2) is abundant, once an alkyl radical R· is formed (R1) it quickly reacts with O2 to
produce a peroxy radical, (RO2, reaction R2).24 Hydrogen abstraction by RO2 is relatively slow, so
under most laboratory conditions (where radical densities are high), recombination reactions are
favored (e.g., RO2 + RO2). Recombination yields either chain terminating products (aldehydes,
ketones, and alcohols—reaction R3), or alkoxy (RO) radicals, which in turn can propagate the
reaction.25–27 In the particle phase, however, the RO-formation channel does not appear as
competitive with chain-terminating recombination, so that an OH reaction with an alkane aerosol
under pristine conditions does not exhibit chain cycling (𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 ≤ 1).28,29

presence of trace NO (a, c) and SO2 (b, d). Adapted with permission from Richards-Henderson, et
al.15,16. Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society.

However, when OH radical oxidation is conducted in the presence of NO and SO2 (Figure
5), 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 > 1, signaling the onset of radical chain cycling. As seen in Figure 5A–B, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 scales
directly with the concentration of the trace gas, since both NO and SO2 can undergo oxidation by
RO2 to yield an RO radical (reaction R4, Scheme 1), which propagates the reaction via hydrogen
abstraction (Label A, Scheme 1). Additionally, for each trace gas, 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 exhibits an inverse
dependence on the radical concentration [OH], with increased reaction probabilities at low
concentrations. At high [OH], the increased production of RO2 radicals favors chain termination
(R3), since the recombination rate scales as [RO2]2, effectively out-competing RO formation (R4).
Conversely, at low [OH], the reaction between RO2 and NO/SO2 dominates the kinetics, leading
to RO radicals and subsequent chain cycling. These results demonstrated that, in the presence of
13

SO2 and NO, the lifetimes of alkanes in atmospheric aerosol could be equivalent to or shorter than
the corresponding gas-phase lifetimes. Thus, measurements of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 helped identify mechanisms
by which particle phase chemistry in polluted conditions could accelerate atmospheric aging.

concentration for the Cl-initiated reaction of Squalane (Sqa) and Squalene (Sqe). Adapted with

In addition to OH oxidation, Liu et al. studied the reaction of chlorine gas with aerosols of
the same saturated hydrocarbon (Sqa).11 In these experiments, highly reactive chlorine atoms (Cl·)
are produced by photolyzing molecular chlorine (Cl2), and thus both species are present during
reaction. As with OH, the reaction is initiated by abstraction of a hydrogen from a C–H bond of
Sqa (R1), but in the absence of atmospheric oxygen (O2), the reaction exhibits 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 ≥ 1, indicating
chain cycling (Figure 6A, blue open circles). While Cl2 is unreactive towards saturated
hydrocarbons, increases in Cl2 concentration lead to an increase in 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 under these anoxic
conditions, as the reaction between Cl2 and an alkyl radical R· regenerates a Cl· (Reaction R5,
Scheme 1), which can initiate hydrogen abstraction and propagate the chain reaction (Label B,
Scheme 1). By comparing the values of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 to the primary uptake coefficient (i.e., 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠 ) inferred

14

from kinetic modeling, it was estimated that an upper bound of 6 Sqa molecules were consumed
by secondary reactions for each reactive collision of gas phase Cl·.11
When O2 is reintroduced, however, the chain-propagating step (R5) must compete with the
formation of RO2 radicals (R2).11 When [O2] is at atmosphere concentrations (~20%), it is orders
of magnitude more abundant than either Cl2 or Cl· in the experiment, leading to high RO2
concentrations. Again, since the recombination rate scales as [RO2]2, this leads to the formation of
oxygenated products and termination of the radical chain (R3). Therefore, the presence of O2 shuts
down reaction, giving rise to the inverse relationship of [O2] and 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 (Figure 6B, blue open
circles). Thus, by analyzing the scaling of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 with the concentrations of key reactants (O2 and
Cl2), a rational mechanism for the complex kinetic behavior could be formulated.
However, simple changes in the functional groups available for reaction in the condensed
phase can lead to unexpected changes in the reaction mechanism and drastic increases in reactivity,
as seen in the chlorination of Sqe aerosols studied by Zeng et al.17 The structure of Sqe is nearly
identical to that of Sqa, except for 6 alkene functional groups (C=C bonds), which allows
electrophilic addition of Cl2 to the molecule (Reaction R6, Scheme 1). While this reaction is quite
slow for pure Sqe aerosols, the presence of particle-phase additives containing oxygenated
functional groups enhanced the effective Cl2 addition rate by 12-23 times over 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠 .31 While the
precise mechanism of this acceleration is under investigation, it was hypothesized that the
oxygenated molecules act as phase transfer catalysts by increasing the Cl2 residence time at the
particle surface.
As a result, when Sqe aerosols were reacted with Cl· in the presence of Cl2, the combination
of Cl2 electrophilic addition chemistry and the radical cycling mechanism described previously led
to an extremely rapid reaction, with 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 for Sqe (green triangles, Figure 6A) that is roughly two
15

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-5bjnw ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0264-0872 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

orders of magnitude larger than for Sqa. But surprisingly, when [O2] was increased the reaction
was accelerated (green triangles, Figure 6B), displaying the opposite the trend in 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 than that
measured previously for Sqa. In addition, the reaction products under high [O2] were almost
entirely chlorinated, not the oxygenated products characteristic of RO2 recombination and chain
termination (R3).
The magnitude of the increase in 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 therefore eliminates Cl· chain propagation as the
source of the accelerated reactivity, as the rate of R5 would not be expected to change so
dramatically between Sqa and Sqe. Instead, a catalytic mechanism promoting Cl2 electrophilic
addition chemistry (R6) was proposed.30 Despite the rapid reaction between Sqe and Cl2, the
radical mechanism described previously is still operative in the presence of high [O2], leading to
RO2 recombination (R3) and chain termination products. However, these termination products
contain the same functional groups as the additives previously observed to catalyze Cl2
electrophilic addition.31 Thus, increased [O2] increases the abundance of these products by
generating a Cl2 phase-transfer catalyst in situ in the aerosol (Label C, Scheme 1), which explains
the unexpected and dramatic increase of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 with [O2] shown in Figure 6B.
As before, investigation of the behavior of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 provided insights into a previously
unknown process with significant impacts beyond atmospheric chemistry, such as in
heterogeneous catalysis. The observation of catalytic behavior during electrophilic addition
chemistry raises new questions to be investigated regarding the role of particle interface in
controlling these reaction dynamics. The usefulness of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 as a probe for discovering novel
reaction mechanisms thus extends beyond radical chemistry, as explored further in the following
section.

In addition to examining the scaling behavior of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 with gas-phase reactants, modifying
the structure of particle-phase reactants can also help elucidate complex reaction mechanisms. One
example is the peroxidation of unsaturated lipids, which typically proceeds via abstraction of a
labile allylic hydrogen adjacent to a C=C bond, followed by addition of O2 to form an unsaturated
RO2 radical (Scheme 2). Although slow, these species can perform intramolecular hydrogen
abstraction from another allylic site, yielding a hydroperoxide (ROOH) and regenerating a R·
radical, which propagates the chemistry (known as autoxidation or lipid peroxidation).32 However,

experiments on lipid oxidation have traditionally been performed in the bulk condensed phase
using radical initiators, instead of realistic radical species such as OH.33,32
To probe this reaction mechanism in aerosols, radical oxidation experiments were again
conducted on aerosols of Sqe, a common component of human skin oil, with oxidation initiated
by OH.18 The scaling of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 with [OH] shows increased chain cycling at low oxidant
concentrations (Figure 7). The unsaturated sites play a role in the mechanism, as decreasing the
number of C=C bonds in the particle phase reactant from 6 (Sqe) to 1 (cis-9-tricosene, Tri) leads
to a decrease in 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 . By contrast, saturated molecules with a single oxygenated functional group
all have 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 < 1, indicating the absence of chain cycling.

Figure 7. (a) Scaling of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 with [OH] for various particle-phase organics shown in (b), both

These kinetics could be interpreted as consistent with a typical lipid peroxidation

(ROOH), but rather secondary ozonides (SOZs), which are typically only observed during
ozonolysis (Scheme 2).34 These species form from the reaction of aldehydes and stabilized Criegee
Intermediates (sCI, not to be confused with Chlorine/Cl·), which are highly reactive molecules
formed during ozonolysis. As first shown by Beauchamp and coworkers,35 sCIs appear to be
formed during radical-initiated oxidation of unsaturated lipids. To test this hypothesis, saturated
alcohols, which can act as sCI scavengers, were incorporated into the particle phase with Sqe.18
The result was the formation of characteristic sCI + alcohol hydroperoxide ether products (Scheme
2), a gradual decrease in the 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 of Sqe as alcohol was added, and a drastic enhancement in the
𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 of the alcohol above its value in pure droplets (Figure 8A). These results imply that sCIs are
not only generated during OH oxidation, but are in fact the species responsible for its chain
propagation, as sCIs can regenerate OH radicals via unimolecular decomposition channels.
The precise mechanism by which sCIs are produced remains under investigation, though
several mechanisms have been proposed18,35–37 each involving the β-hydroxy peroxy radical (βRO2) formed after OH addition to the alkene (Scheme 2). A recent modeling study of the OH
oxidation of Sqe evaluated the kinetic viability of 3 possible mechanisms,38 but further combined
theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to establish a comprehensive description of this
step.

condensed phase during (a) OH-radical initiated Sqe oxidation. (Figure adapted with permission
from Zeng et al.18 Copyright 2020 National Academy of Sciences) and (b) ozonolysis of Tri aerosol
(Figure adapted with permission from Zeng and Wilson.19 Copyright 2020 American Chemical
Society.) The value of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 is corrected for the mole fraction of the reactant in these mixture
experiments to account for dilution effects.
Regardless of the specific mechanism by which they are generated, sCIs have been shown
to constitute a new link between two typically distinct chemical mechanisms, namely secondary
chemistry resulting from ozonolysis and OH-initiated radical oxidation (Scheme 2). As a result,
radical chain cycling can be initiated by ozonolysis in addition to OH oxidation, as further explored
by Zeng et al. using cis-9-tricosene (Tri) aerosols.19 Tri has a single C=C bond, which simplifies
the reaction mechanism and potential products of ozonolysis, and it has no oxygenated functional
groups, which act as sCI scavengers. Additionally, the aldehydes formed from ozonolysis of Tri
are volatile and preferentially evaporate from the particle, thereby removing another potential sink
of the CI in the particle phase. These properties make Tri an excellent candidate for observing CIpropagated chain cycling.
During ozonolysis, the 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 of Tri during was measured to be 5.2x10-4, which is an order
of magnitude larger than previous measurements of 𝛾𝑔𝑎𝑠,𝑂3 .39 Even though the 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 is less than 1,
substantial chain cycling can still be inferred by comparison of these two measurements.
Incorporating a particle-phase saturated alcohol, which is unreactive toward O3, resulted in the
decrease of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 (Figure 8B), as was observed for the OH + Sqe reaction (Figure 8A). In addition,
a decrease in the radical chain termination products of Tri (Scheme 2) was observed in the presence
of alcohol. Surprisingly, kinetic modeling suggests that radical chain cycling is the dominant
oxidation pathway for Tri during ozonolysis, accounting for nearly 70% of the reactivity.19 Thus,
this pathway could be kinetically quite significant during ozonolysis chemistry.

However, assessing the significance of this radical chain cycling to atmospheric aerosol
aging requires knowledge of the precise rate constants of reactions between sCIs and the various
functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, that might be present in these environments.40 In
particular, gas-phase measurements of reactions between small sCIs and carboxylic acids yield a
rate constant (kacid) with values at or exceeding the limit for collision-controlled processes,41,42 but
the applicability of this rate to particle-phase sCI is in need of evaluation.

Figure 9. Scaling of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 for Tri during ozonolysis as a function of mole fraction of acid sCI
scavenger (HDA). Lines correspond to model predictions with differing values of kacid: a slower
rate competitive with unimolecular processes (solid line) and the diffusion-limited rate analogous
to the collision limit in the gas phase (dashed line). Figure adapted with permission from Reynolds
et al.20. Copyright 2023 American Chemical Society.
Building on previous ozonolysis studies with Tri, an experimental approach involving
aerosol mixtures allows the value of kacid in the particle phase to be constrained.20 Varying amounts
of a saturated liquid carboxylic acid, 2-hexyldecanoic acid (HDA), are incorporated into Tri
aerosols undergoing ozonolysis where, similar to the behavior with saturated alcohols, the 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 of
Tri decreased. Since HDA is unreactive toward O3, any decay of HDA observed during ozonolysis

is attributable to sCI chemistry, primarily resulting in a hydroperoxide ester product (Scheme 2).
These decay kinetics can be explained in terms of a simple model of the competition between
bimolecular reaction of sCIs with HDA, which is chain-terminating, and the unimolecular
decomposition reactions of sCIs to initiate radical chemistry, as shown in Figure 9.20 By fitting this
model to the HDA decay profiles observed during Tri ozonolysis, a relative ratio of these rate
constants could be obtained. However, measurements of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 also constrain the value of the rate
constant kacid in kinetic simulations. If the sCI + HDA reaction is extremely fast, it would be
expected to proceed at the diffusion limit in the condensed phase, but simulations corresponding
to this rate shut off the radical chain cycling too quickly. This leads to a rapid falloff in 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 with
HDA concentration (dashed line, Figure 9) that is inconsistent with experimental observations.
Thus, an upper bound can be established on kacid, suggesting a more reasonable rate that keeps this
reaction channel competitive with the unimolecular reactions of sCIs.
Through careful experimental design, including changes to the particle-phase composition
and molecular structure of the reactants, measurements of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 can be used to establish new links
between different branches of oxidation chemistry. Applications of this approach thus extend
beyond their typical application to heterogeneous reactions on atmospheric aerosols and into
research fields such as oxidative stress in biological systems or the design of antioxidants for
reducing food spoilage.18

Summary and Conclusions
Studies designed around the measurement and interpretation of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 have the potential to help
explain the complex behavior of chemical systems controlled by reaction and diffusion. By
examining the relationship between 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 and reactant transport parameters, insight is gained into
the effects of diffusion limitations on heterogeneous oxidation. By examining the relationship

between 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 and various gas-phase reactants, the mechanisms of radical reactions can be
determined. And by measuring 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 , while selectively modifying the constituents of the particle
phase, new links between disparate reaction mechanisms can be uncovered. We hope it is evident
through the examples shown here that the insights gained from these studies have broad
applicability both in the field of heterogeneous chemistry and beyond. There are many possible
reaction parameters to be explored using 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 besides those explored in the examples presented
here, including studies of 𝛾𝑒𝑓𝑓 as a function of surface area (e.g., particle size in aerosols) and
ambient temperature, which can provide a molecular-level understanding of interfacial processes
and reaction thermodynamics. Fundamental insights such as these are crucial to unraveling the
behavior of any complex chemical system, from atmospheric aerosols to cellular membranes.
