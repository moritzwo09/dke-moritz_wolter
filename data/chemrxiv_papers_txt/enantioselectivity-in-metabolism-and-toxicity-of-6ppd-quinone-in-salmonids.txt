Abstract

17

The toxicity of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPD-Q)

18

in salmonids has been found to be sensitive to even minor structural changes on its alkyl

19

side chain. Inspired by this, we herein isolated the enantiomers of 6PPD-Q and tested their

20

in vitro metabolism in liver S9 of rainbow trout (O. mykiss), along with their toxicity in a

21

coho salmon (O. kisutch) embryo (CSE-119) cell line. (R)-6PPD-Q was found to be rapidly

22

metabolized in rainbow trout liver S9 with a half-life (t1/2) of 12.3 minutes, which was 2.92

23

times faster than that of (S)-6PPD-Q. This was further evidenced by the preferential

24

formation of an (R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite. Supporting this, enantioselective

25

accumulation of (S)-6PPD-Q was found in rainbow trout in vivo. To further distinguish

26

between kinetics and intrinsic toxicity, we tested the toxicity of 6PPD-Q enantiomers in

27

the CSE-119 cell line with minimal metabolism of 6PPD-Q. (R)-6PPD-Q was found to

28

strongly induce cytotoxicity in CSE-119 cells with an EC50 of 17.7 µg/L, which was 3.94

29

times stronger than that of (S)-6PPD-Q. In summary, this study reported the

30

enantioselectivity in both the toxicity and metabolism of 6PPD-Q, demonstrating that its

31

toxicity should be mediated by specific protein binding.

Introduction

37

N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is an additive commonly

38

used in tires to prevent their oxidative degradation, with 50 to 100 million tons utilized

39

annually in the United States alone.1-3 During its life cycle, 6PPD can be oxidized to N-

40

(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD-Q),4-6 which exerts

41

extreme aquatic toxicity in coho salmon (O. kisutch) with a median lethal concentration

42

(LC50) of 95 ng/L.7, 8 Interestingly, large interspecies variation was observed for the toxicity

43

of 6PPD-Q even among species belonging to the Salmonidae family. For instance, 6PPD-

44

Q was also found to be toxic to rainbow trout (O. mykiss) but not to the closely-related

45

arctic char (S. alpinus);9-11 however, the toxicity mechanism remains unknown. An in-

46

depth exploration of the structure-related toxicity of 6PPD-Q is not only important to

47

identify a safe replacement antioxidant for 6PPD but is also critical for understanding its

48

toxicity mechanism.

49

Recent studies from our group discovered that even minor structural modifications

50

to the alkyl side chain of 6PPD-Q can completely abolish its toxicity.12, 13 Considering the

51

presence of a chiral center on the second carbon (C2) of its alkyl side chain, it is important

52

to investigate the potential enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Indeed, recent research

53

from the Wang group has reported that (S)-6PPD-Q exhibited stronger toxicity than (R)-

54

6PPD-Q in rainbow trout.14, 15 The enantioselective toxicity of xenobiotics often arises

55

from their intrinsic ability to selectively bind to specific protein targets. A well-known

56

example is the greater teratogenicity of (S)-thalidomide compared to (R)-thalidomide in

57

humans, which was later attributed to the selective binding of (S)-thalidomide to the

58

cereblon (CRBN) protein.16-18 Moreover, pharmacokinetic processes including absorption,

59

distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) can be enantioselective and impact the

60

downstream toxicity of chiral xenobiotics, with metabolism playing a particularly

61

important role.19-21 6PPD-Q was found to be rapidly metabolized to its hydroxylated

62

counterparts in rainbow trout, with these metabolites becoming predominate in fish tissues

63

within 24 hours.11-13 Interestingly, distinct from other PPD-Q analogues, 6PPD-Q is

64

regioselectively hydroxylated on the C4 tertiary carbon on its alkyl side chain to form the

65

unique C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite.12, 13, 22 The C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite was

66

confirmed to be nontoxic, serving as a potential detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q.22 The

67

potential contribution for this unique metabolite to the enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-

68

Q is worthy of further inquiry. However, distinguishing between the confounding factors

69

of metabolism and intrinsic toxicity using in vivo testing alone is challenging. It remains

70

unclear whether the enantioselective toxicity of (S)-6PPD-Q is driven by its metabolism or

71

intrinsic toxicity.

72

In this study, we aimed to systematically investigate the enantioselectivity of 6PPD-

73

Q in terms of both its metabolism and toxicity. To achieve this, we 1) purified 6PPD-Q

74

enantiomers using preparative high performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC); 2)

75

investigated the enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q using liver S9 of rainbow trout;

76

3) assessed the intrinsic toxicity of 6PPD-Q enantiomers using a coho salmon embryonic

77

(CSE-119) cell line where the contributions of metabolism to enantioselective toxicity can

78

be mitigated. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the C2 chiral carbon on the side alkyl chain

79

influences both the metabolism and intrinsic toxicity of 6PPD-Q.

124

to acquire the calculated ECD spectra of 6PPD-Q enantiomers. Firstly, the molecular

125

mechanics field (MM2) was used to optimize the 3D structures of (R)- and (S)-6PPD-Q.

126

Then the geometric optimization and frequency calculations were conducted to get the most

127

stable conformations of two enantiomers based on the B3LYP function of the 6-311+G (2d,

128

p) basis set. Finally, the absolute configurations of the 6PPD-Q enantiomers were

129

confirmed by comparing the calculated and experimental ECD spectra.

130

Rainbow trout and arctic char liver S9 preparation. The preparation of S9 from liver

131

of rainbow trout or arctic char was reported in our previous study.22 Briefly, the livers of

132

rainbow trout and arctic char were rinsed with 1 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffer (0.08 M

133

sodium phosphate, 0.02 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.4). After discarding the PBS, 0.2 g

134

of tissue was finely minced with scissors into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Then, 800 µL

135

of phosphate buffer was added, and the tissue was homogenized using a Fisher Scientific

136

Powergen 125 (FTH-115) blade-type homogenizer (Waltham, MA, USA). Following

137

centrifugation at 9,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C, the resulting supernatant (S9 fraction) was

138

transferred to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Total protein concentration was determined

139

using a Bradford protein assay, and the supernatant (S9 fraction) was stored at -80°C. All

140

steps were performed on ice, and equipment was cleaned with water and acetone before

141

use.

142

In vitro metabolism. In vitro metabolism experiments were conducted using a similar

143

protocol reported in previous studies.22 In a 2 mL centrifuge tube, 150 µg/L of (rac)-6PPD-

144

Q was incubated with 1.0 mg/mL of rainbow trout/arctic char liver S9 in 47 µL of sodium

145

phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8). The reaction was initiated by adding 3 µL of NADPH

146

(10.5 mM) to the above solution. Incubation proceeded at 20°C for 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90,

147

120, and 180 minutes, respectively. Reactions were quenched by transferring 40 µL of

148

mixtures to 120 µL of ice-cold acetonitrile with 0.1 mg/L of d5-6PPD-Q in a new tube,

149

followed by vortex for 20 minutes and ultra-sonication for 15 minutes. Samples were

150

centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected for analysis. For

151

the negative controls, the procedures were the same as the above experiment, except that

152

liver S9 was heat-deactivated at 95°C for 10 minutes. In blank controls, (rac)-6PPD-Q was

153

replaced by the same volume of acetonitrile (< 1% v/v).

154

Cell Viability Assay. Cell viability of CSE-119 cells exposed to 6PPD-Q enantiomers was

155

assessed using alamarBlue viability assay.13, 24 The day before the exposure experiment,

156

CSE-119 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 100 µL

157

of culture media. After 24 hours of incubation, the culture media in the 96-well plate was

158

replaced with exposure media containing 6PPD-Q enantiomers at 7 different

159

concentrations (0.137 to 100 µg/L), each in 4 replicates. The acetonitrile concentration in

160

the culture media was less than 0.2% (v/v), at which no significant toxicity was observed.

161

Then cells were cultured for another 48 hours at 20°C, followed by addition of 10 µL of

162

0.30 mg/mL alamarBlue reagent per well and further incubation for 4 hours at 20°C.

163

Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro M Plex microplate

164

reader (Tecan Life Sciences, Switzerland) at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and an

165

emission wavelength of 600 nm. Fluorescence values of each well were compared to

166

solvent controls on the same plate to calculate cell viability.

168

for 24 hours, the culture media was replaced with exposure media containing 6PPD-Q (10

169

µg/L), and the assessing of metabolism method was conducted according to a prior study.23

170

For the control group, the same volume of fresh culture media, containing 0.1% acetonitrile,

171

was added into the petri dish. Three replicates were included in both experimental and

172

control groups. After 48 hours of incubation, the culture media was removed, and the cells

173

were washed twice using 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following this, 1 mL

174

of trypsin solution was added to detach the cells from the bottom of the petri dish. After

175

the trypsin solution was discarded, 3 mL of PBS was added in order to collect the cells,

176

which were then transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 200 g for 10

177

minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and 1.2 mL of acetonitrile containing 6PPD-Q-d5

178

was added to the pellet. The mixture was vortexed for 30 minutes and then sonicated for

179

30 minutes. Finally, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, and the

180

supernatant was collected and evaporated under nitrogen until dryness. The extract was

181

reconstituted in 100 µL of acetonitrile for LC-MS analysis.

182

Quality Control and Quality Assurance. Procedural blanks (acetonitrile only) were

183

included in each batch of samples. During LC-MS analysis, an authentic standard of 6PPD-

184

Q was injected after each group of 15 samples to check the stability of instrument.

185

Acetonitrile was injected after each group of 8 samples to monitor potential carry-over.

186

Strong linearity (R2 > 0.99) was obtained for the external calibration curve of 6PPD-Q in

187

the range of 6.25 to 100 µg/L. The 6PPD-Q-d5 was used as the internal standard to correct

188

potential loss of 6PPD-Q during extraction of liver S9 and CSE-119 cells. Due to the lack

189

of standards, hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q except for C4-OH-6PPD-Q were semi-

190

quantified using 6PPD-Q. In the experiment of in vitro metabolism, the recoveries of (R)9

191

6PPD-Q and (S)-6PPD-Q were 104±5.4% and 99.5±8.2% in rainbow trout S9, and 114±

192

13.8% and 105 ± 7.0% in arctic char S9. The method detection limits (MDLs) were

193

determined by the y intercept divided by the 99% confidence level of the slope of the

194

calibration curve, and the detection limits of (R)-6PPD-Q and (S)-6PPD-Q for the

195

incubation mixtures were 2.2 – 2.7 µg/L and 2.4 – 3.0 µg/L, respectively.

196

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were primarily conducted using GraphPad Prism

197

(v10.1.2, GraphPad Software Inc., Boston, MA, USA). The enantioseparation was

198

evaluated using resolution factor (Rs), as follows:

199

Rs = 2(tR2 − tR1)/(W1 + W2)

200

wherein tR and W represented the retention time and peak width of the enantiomer,

201

respectively.

202

The first-order kinetics of the metabolism in liver S9 was fitted by the following

203

equations:25

204

Ln(Ct/C0)=-k·t

(2)

205

t1/2=ln2/k

(3)

206

wherein t, Ct, C0, k, and t1/2 were the incubation time, substrate concentrations at time t,

207

initial concentration, first-order rate constant (h-1), and half-life, respectively.

208

Enantiomer fraction (EF) was used to evaluate the enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-

209

Q enantiomers,26 as follows:

210

EF=CS/(CR+CS)

211

where CR and CS represented the concentrations of the (R)-enantiomer and (S)-enantiomer,

212

respectively.

Results and discussion

214

Isolation and structure characterization of 6PPD-Q enantiomers. Since the

215

enantiomers of 6PPD-Q (Figure 1A) were not commercially available, we purified its

216

enantiomers from a racemic mixture. The CHIRALPAK IA column was selected among

217

various chiral columns as it achieved a baseline separation of 6PPD-Q enantiomers,

218

wherein two peaks eluted at 11.09 minutes and 14.67 minutes, respectively (Figure 1B).

219

The separation factor (3.49) was well above 1.5, demonstrating a complete separation of

220

the two enantiomers. We then used the same CHIRALPAK IA column to purify

221

enantiomers from the racemic mixture of 6PPD-Q. Approximately 1 mg of enantiomers

222

were successfully obtained (Figure S1). The purity of each enantiomer was confirmed to

223

exceed 98 % via LC-UV (Figure S2).

experimental ECD spectra for the two peaks at 11.09 minutes and 14.67 minutes align with

233

the calculated spectra of (R)-6PPD-Q and (S)-6PPD-Q, in the two major absorbance

234

regions (<270 and >350 nm) of 6PPD-Q.27 The discrepancies between calculated and

235

experimental spectrum at 290-350 nm might be attributed to the low absorbance in this

236

region,28 and the small ∆ε of 6PPD-Q. Therefore, the results demonstrated that (R)-6PPD-

237

Q (RT=11.09 min) was eluted earlier from the CHIRALPAK IA column than (S)-6PPD-Q

238

(RT=14.67 min), which was consistent with a previous study from Wang et al. using a

239

similar chiral column.14

In vitro and in vivo enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout. After

241

isolating the 6PPD-Q enantiomers, we proceeded to assess their metabolism using liver S9

as an in vitro model. As shown in Figure 2A, >90 % of 6PPD-Q was rapidly depleted within

243

90 minutes after the incubation of (rac)-6PPD-Q with rainbow trout liver S9, while such

244

depletion was not observed in the negative controls (heat deactivated S9). The metabolism

245

of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout liver S9 was much faster than other common pollutants under

246

similar conditions, such as fenamidon, tembotrione and trifloxystrobin.29 This aligned with

247

previous in vivo studies showing that 6PPD-Q was rapidly metabolized in rainbow trout

248

fish within 24 hours.13

The rapid metabolism of (R)-6PPD-Q and (S)-6PPD-Q resulted in half-lives of 12.3 and

257

35.9 minutes, respectively (Figure 2A). This demonstrated that (R)-6PPD-Q was

258

metabolized in rainbow trout liver S9 at a rate of 2.92 times faster than that of (S)-6PPD-

259

Q. Correspondingly, the enantiomeric fraction (EF) value of (R)-6PPD-Q decreased from

260

0.51 ± 0.03 at 0 minutes to 0.08 ± 0.07 at 90 minutes (p < 0.001, Figure 2B). The

261

preferential metabolism of (R)-6PPD-Q was clearly observed by comparing the chiral

chromatograms of 6PPD-Q, wherein the two enantiomers initially displayed similar peak

263

abundances, but (S)-6PPD-Q dominated after 90 minutes of incubation with liver S9

264

(Figure 2C). This is the first report of the enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q, and was

265

surprising given the small size of the methyl group on the C2 chiral carbon.

266

To further confirm the potential enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q in vivo, we

267

analyzed the 6PPD-Q enantiomers present in rainbow trout tissue collected in our previous

268

study, from fish that were exposed to 3.0 µg/L of (rac)-6PPD-Q for 96 hours.12 This dose

269

was chosen as it was close to the LD50 (2.08 µg/L) of (rac)-6PPD-Q in rainbow trout.12 As

270

shown in Figure 2D, 2.38-fold stronger accumulation of (S)-6PPD-Q (56.0 ± 7.9 ng/g)

271

relative to (R)-6PPD-Q (23.5 ± 6.3 ng/g, p = 0.01) was observed in fish tissues after

272

exposure to 3.0 µg/L of (rac)-6PPD-Q for 96 hours. This finding aligns with in vitro liver

273

S9 results, wherein (R)-6PPD-Q was metabolized more rapidly than (S)-6PPD-Q. Based

274

on these in vitro and in vivo results, we concluded that the preferential metabolism of (R)-

275

6PPD-Q led to its lower bioaccumulation in rainbow trout tissue. Recent studies from the

276

Wang group reported that (R)-6PPD-Q exhibited 2.60 times weaker toxicity in rainbow

277

trout,14 which was comparable to its faster metabolism rate (2.92 times faster) and weaker

278

accumulation (2.38 times) observed in the current study. Our recent study found that the

279

hydroxylation metabolism of 6PPD-Q is a detoxification pathway,22 thus, the

280

enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout should be partially attributed to

281

differential metabolism and detoxification of enantiomers.

282

Enantioselective formation of hydroxylated metabolites in rainbow trout liver S9. To

283

further investigate the enantioselective metabolism pathways of 6PPD-Q, we employed

284

high-resolution mass spectrometry based nontargeted analysis to identify metabolites in

285

rainbow trout liver S9. Consistent with our previous studies,13 a total of five mono- and di-

286

hydroxylated metabolites were detected from (rac)-6PPD-Q after incubation with rainbow

287

trout liver S9 (see structures in Figure 3D). Specifically, four mono-hydroxylated 6PPD-

288

Qs (m/z =315.1700, C18H22N2O3) were detected, at the retention times of 5.36 (I), 5.86 (II),

289

7.08 (III), and 7.33 (IV) minutes on the CHIRALPAK IA column, respectively (Figure 3A,

290

S3A-3D). Using a chemical standard synthesized in our recent study,22 metabolites III and

291

IV were confirmed to be (S)- and (R)-C4-OH-6PPD-Q, respectively (Figure S4A and Figure

292

S5A). Among the five OH-6PPD-Qs, C4-OH-6PPD-Q was of particular interest because it

293

was previously shown to be selectively formed from 6PPD-Q, but not other PPD-Qs,

294

despite their structural similarity.12 The successful separation of C4-OH-6PPD-Q

295

enantiomers provided an opportunity to explore its formation mechanism. Similar to C4-

296

OH-6PPD-Q, the minor metabolite II was also assigned as an alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q, based on

297

its diagnostic fragment of m/z 99.0808 (Figure S3B). We excluded the possibility of this

298

metabolite being C3-OH-6PPD-Q by using a synthesized chemical standard also prepared

299

in-house alongside the C4 standard, so it was likely C5-OH-6PPD-Q. The metabolite I at

300

5.36 min was assigned as aryl-OH-6PPD-Q according to the diagnostic fragments of m/z

301

231.0766, m/z 257.0918 and m/z 273.1227 with hydroxyl group on the aryl ring (Figure

302

S3A), but its enantiomers could not be separated on the CHIRALPAK IA column.

313

In addition to the four mono-hydroxylated 6PPD-Qs, a di-hydroxylated 6PPD-Q metabolite

314

(V) was also detected with m/z of 331.1653 (RT = 3.84 min, C18H22N2O4). Its MS2

315

spectrum indicated hydroxyl groups on the aryl and alkyl side chains, separately (Figure

316

S3E). By comparing its MS2 spectrum with those of synthesized C3-OH-6PPD-Q, C4-OH-

317

6PPD-Q, and the metabolite (V), the hydroxyl group on the alkyl side chain was very likely

318

on C4 (Figure S5). Collectively, we detected 5 hydroxylated 6PPD-Q metabolites in the

319

liver S9 of rainbow trout, and successfully separated the enantiomers of the key C4-alkyl-

320

OH-6PPD-Q metabolite.

321

After incubating (rac)-6PPD-Q in the liver S9 of rainbow trout for 180 minutes, the total

322

concentration (88.2 ± 0.28 µg/L, Figure 3B) of 5 hydroxylated metabolites explained the

323

majority (58.8 ± 0.19%) of the 6PPD-Q loss from the initial amount (150 µg/L). We

324

initially focused on C4-OH-6PPD-Q, as it is the only metabolite with separable enantiomers.

325

Both (R)- and (S)-C4-OH-6PPD-Q enantiomers showed similar abundances during the first

326

10 minutes of incubation (Figure 3B, EF = 0.53 ± 0.01, p = 0.16), demonstrating

327

comparable rates of formation from 6PPD-Q. This findings suggested that the metabolism

328

of 6PPD-Q to C4-OH-6PPD-Q was not enantioselective. Interestingly, (S)-C4-OH-6PPD-

329

Q was continuously formed over time, while (R)-C4-OH-6PPD-Q remained stable after 40

330

minutes. The faster formation of (S)-C4-OH-6PPD-Q after 40 minutes didn’t align with the

331

more rapid depletion of (R)-6PPD-Q (e.g., 4.33 ± 0.99 µg/L at 40 minutes) compared to

332

(S)-6PPD-Q (e.g., 17.1 ± 0.89 µg/L at 40 minutes), suggesting that other metabolic

333

pathways should be primarily responsible for the enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q.

334

Enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q was driven by the preferential formation of

335

(R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q. After excluding the C4-OH-6PPD-Q pathway, we proceeded to test

336

whether other pathways cause the enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q. To test this, we

337

separately incubated the enantiomers of 6PPD-Q with the liver S9 of rainbow trout, as most

338

hydroxylated metabolites can not be separated on the chiral column. Interestingly, as shown

339

in Figure 3C, distinct profiles of hydroxylated metabolites were formed from (R)- and (S)-

340

6PPD-Q. Particularly, aryl-OH-6PPD-Q contributed to 39.3 ± 1.05% of total hydroxylated

341

metabolites generated from (R)-6PPD-Q, which was significantly higher that from (S)-

342

6PPD-Q (15.0 ± 0.19%, p<0.001). This clearly demonstrated the preferential metabolism

343

of (R)-6PPD-Q to (R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q, a result that was not evident in the experiments

344

with racemic 6PPD-Q. In addition, the preferential formation of (R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q

345

well-explained the faster metabolism of (R)-6PPD-Q as mentioned above. Taking all the

346

data into account, we concluded that enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q should be

347

primarily driven by the preferential formation of (R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q.

348

In addition to the faster formation of (R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q from (R)-6PPD-Q, a higher

349

amount of di-OH-6PPD-Q was also produced from (R)-6PPD-Q (Figure 3C). Specifically,

350

di-OH-6PPD-Q accounted for 2.87 ± 0.46% of total hydroxylated metabolites formed from

351

(R)-6PPD-Q, which was significantly higher than that from (S)-6PPD-Q (0.74 ± 0.17%,

352

p<0.001). The faster formation of di-OH-6PPD-Q and aryl-OH-6PPD-Q from (R)-6PPD-

353

Q demonstrated that they share the same metabolic pathway. Supporting this, the formation

354

of di-OH-6PPD-Q was rapid during the first 20 minutes of incubation with S9 but slowed

355

down after 40 minutes (Figure 3B). This trend aligned with the decrease in the

19

356

concentrations of aryl-OH-6PPD-Q after 40 minutes, which further suggested that di-OH-

357

6PPD-Q was likely formed from aryl-OH-6PPD-Q, rather than from C4-OH-6PPD-Q. To

358

further confirm this, we incubated synthesized C4-OH-6PPD-Q with rainbow trout liver S9.

359

As expected, C4-OH-6PPD-Q was not significantly metabolized, and no formation of di-

360

OH-6PPD-Q was observed after incubation with liver S9 for 60 minutes (Figure S6). This

361

clearly demonstrated that di-OH-6PPD-Q should be primarily formed from aryl-OH-

362

6PPD-Q.

363

In summary, 6PPD-Q was metabolized in rainbow trout through one minor and two major

364

pathways. Of the two major pathways, the enantioselective metabolism of 6PPD-Q was

365

primarily driven by the preferential formation of (R)-aryl-OH-6PPD-Q. Additionally, di-

366

OH-6PPD-Q was primarily formed from aryl-OH-6PPD-Q rather than from C4-OH-6PPD-

367

Q (Figure 3D).

368

In vitro toxicity of 6PPD-Q enantiomers in a CSE-119 cell line. Enantioselective toxicity

369

of xenobiotics could be driven by both kinetics (i.e., metabolism and bioaccumulation) and

370

intrinsic toxicity (i.e., protein binding affinity). While we have confirmed that the

371

metabolism of 6PPD-Q contributes to its in vivo enantioselective toxicity in rainbow trout,

372

we have not excluded the potential role of intrinsic toxicity. To distinguish between these

373

two confounding factors, in vitro fish cell lines would be an ideal model, where the

374

confounding impact of kinetics is excluded. However, to our best knowledge, rainbow trout

375

cell lines have not been benchmarked for 6PPD-Q toxicity testing. Indeed, RTG-2, RTgill-

376

W1 and RTL-W1, three commonly used rainbow trout cell lines, were found insensitive to

377

the toxicity of 6PPD-Q.24, 30 Therefore, instead of rainbow trout fish cell lines, we decided

378

to use the coho salmon CSE-119 cell line as it has been recently benchmarked as an in vitro

379

model for the toxicity testing of 6PPD-Q.13, 20 This was further supported by the same

380

toxicity trend of PPD-Qs between CSE-119 cell line and in vivo fish testing, confirming

381

that the toxicity pathway was conserved in the CSE-119 cell line.13

382

We then proceeded to test whether the metabolism of 6PPD-Q was active in the CSE-119

383

cell line. After exposure to (rac)-6PPD-Q for 48 hours, only minor amounts (<0.1 % of

384

6PPD-Q) of C4-OH-6PPD-Q were detected among five OH-6PPD-Qs. This demonstrated

385

that the metabolism of 6PPD-Q was very limited in CSE-119 cells. Consistent with this,

386

similar masses of (R)- (0.143 ± 0.04 ng) and (S)-6PPD-Q (0.136 ± 0.03 ng, p = 0.86) were

387

detected in the same samples of cells (Figure 4A). This further supported that there was no

388

enantioselective accumulation or metabolism of 6PPD-Q in CSE-119 cells. The results

389

validated the CSE-119 cell line as an in vitro model for testing the intrinsic toxicity of

390

6PPD-Q enantiomers, where the contributions of metabolism to enantioselective toxicity

391

can be mitigated as a confounding factor.

392

We then proceeded to test the toxicity of (R)-6PPD-Q and (S)-6PPD-Q in the CSE-119 cell

393

line. The EC50 of (R)-6PPD-Q was determined to be 17.7 µg/L, 3.94 times stronger than

394

that of (S)-6PPD-Q (69.7 µg/L) under the same exposure condition (Figure 4B). This

395

demonstrated the enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-Q, with stronger toxicity observed for

396

(R)-6PPD-Q. It should be noted that the stronger toxicity of (R)-6PPD-Q in in vitro CSE-

397

119 cells was different from the previous in vivo study in rainbow trout,14 where (S)-6PPD-

398

Q (LC50 = 1.66 µg/L) was more toxic than (R)-6PPD-Q (LC50 = 4.31 µg/L). This further

399

indicated that the stronger toxicity of (S)-6PPD-Q than (R)-6PPD-Q in rainbow trout could

400

be largely attributed to its slower metabolism rate and hence stronger accumulation.

401

However, future studies are warranted to use coho salmon fish to confirm the

402

enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-Q in vivo.

Implications. Previous studies have reported the enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-Q in

412

rainbow trout, though the mechanism remains unclear.14, 15 We herein discovered

413

enantioselectivity in both the metabolism and intrinsic toxicity of 6PPD-Q in two sensitive

414

fish species (see the scheme in Figure 4C). The rapid metabolic rate of (R)-6PPD-Q leads

415

to its lower in vivo toxicity in rainbow trout, which was consistent with our recent finding

416

that hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q was a detoxification process.22 Notably, enantioselective

417

metabolism of 6PPD-Q was not observed (EF = 0.50 - 0.48) in the artic char (S. alpinus)

418

(Figure S7), a species not sensitive to 6PPD-Q. Future studies are warranted to examine

419

whether enantioselective metabolism is fundamentally related to the interspecies variations

420

in toxicity.

421

Our previous studies suggested that selective protein binding, rather than nonselective

422

toxicity pathways (e.g., reactive oxygenated species, ROS), may mediate the toxicity of

423

6PPD-Q.12 This hypothesis was further supported by the enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-

424

Q in CSE-119 cells, as enantioselectivity is characteristic of protein binding as exemplified

425

by the selective binding of (S)-thalidomide to the CRBN protein.16-18 Taken together, both

426

the kinetics (e.g., metabolism and bioaccumulation) and intrinsic toxicity (e.g., binding to

427

the protein of interest, POI) played important roles in the enantioselective toxicity of 6PPD-

428

Q in salmonids (Figure 4C). However, more comprehensive molecular biology research is

429

needed to identify the metabolic enzyme and POI mediating the metabolism and toxicity

430

of 6PPD-Q.
