ABSTRACT: Mapping of O2 with luminescent sensors within intact animals is challenging due to attenuation of excitation
and emission light caused by tissue absorption and scattering, as well as interfering background fluorescence. Here we show
the application of luminescent O2 sensor nanoparticles (~40‐50 nm) composed of the O2 indicator platinum(II) tetra(4‐
fluoro)phenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPTBPF) immobilized in poly(methyl methacrylate‐co‐methacrylic acid) (PMMA‐
MA). We injected the sensor nanoparticles into the gastrovascular system of intact colony fractions of reef‐building, tropical
corals that harbor photosynthetic microalgae in their tissues. The sensor nanoparticles are excited by red LED light (617
nm) and emit in the near‐infrared (780 nm), which enhances transmission of excitation and emission light through biolog‐
ical materials. This enabled us to map the internal O2 concentration via time‐domain luminescence lifetime imaging
through the outer tissue layers across several coral polyps in flowing seawater. After injection, nanoparticles dispersed
within the coral tissue over several hours. While luminescence intensity imaging showed some local aggregation of sensor
particles, lifetime imaging showed a more homogenous O2 distribution across a larger area of the coral colony. Local stim‐
ulation of symbiont photosynthesis in corals induced oxygenation of illuminated tissue areas and formation of lateral O2
gradients toward surrounding respiring tissues, which were dissipated rapidly after onset of darkness. Such measurements
are key to improve our understanding of how corals regulate their internal chemical microenvironment and metabolic
activity and how they are affected by environmental stress such as ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation. Our
experimental approach can also be adapted for in vivo O2 imaging in other natural systems such as biofilms, plant and
animal tissues, as well as in organoids and other cell constructs, where imaging internal O2 conditions are relevant and
challenging due to high optical density and background fluorescence.

INTRODUCTION
Measuring O2 concentration is a key component in many environmental, physiological or ecological
studies, as it is i) consumed in aerobic respiration, ii) produced in oxygenic photosynthesis, and iii) used
for reoxidation of reduced products from anaerobic processes. It thus plays an essential role for important physiological and biogeochemical processes in the biosphere (1,2). The solubility of O2 in water
is relatively low, i.e., 1 liter of air contains ca. 30 times more O2 than a liter of air-saturated water. At
the same time, the O2 transport by diffusion is about 10000 times slower in water than in air. Consequently, aquatic habitats and organisms can undergo strong shifts in their O2 regime ranging from supersaturated (hyperoxic) conditions over normal air saturated conditions (normoxia) to critical low concentrations (hypoxia) or even anoxia depending on the balance between O2 formation (via photosynthesis),
consumption (via respiration) and transport via diffusion and advection. Excess loading of organic carbon in coastal waters can e.g. lead to strong O2 depletion via microbial biomass breakdown, causing
mortality of marine animals and formation of benthic or planktonic “death” zones, where O2 is deprived.
Currently, climate change is driving an ongoing ocean deoxygenation (3), which already has led to increasing prevalence of hypoxia and its harmful effects in many marine habitats (4).
Albeit overlooked for many years, ocean deoxygenation is now also recognized as a substantial
threat to coral reefs (5,6), but how corals are able to regulate their internal O2 levels in response to
changes in external O2 remains poorly understood (7). A key limitation is our ability to link the O2
concentration in the surrounding water to the tissue‐level O2 concentration, which is affected by
coral morphology and metabolism but also O2 transfer across the tissue‐water and tissue‐skeleton
interface.
Colonies of tropical reef‐building corals are composed of hundreds to thousands of simple, calci‐
fying polyp animals that harbor photosynthetic microalgae in their tissues, and the photosynthates
translocated from the microalgal symbionts to the surrounding host cells are the major source of
organic carbon for the animal. The polyps have tentacles with stinging cells that can catch prey,
which is taken up via the mouth and digested in the gastric cavity releasing essential nutrients,
which can be shared between different polyps in a coral colony via channels in their connective
tissue (FIG. 1). Corals can thus exhibit strong tissue plasticity via expansion and contraction, which
affects the surface area to volume ratio and thus the gas exchange between coral tissue and the
surrounding seawater (8).
Point measurements with electrochemical and fiber‐optic microsensors (9,10) showed that the O2
status of corals undergoes strong dynamics during day‐night cycles, where supersaturating O2 lev‐
els build up during daytime due to the photosynthesis by their microalgal symbionts, while hypoxic
(or even anoxic) conditions are observed during night‐time due to respiration and limited O2 trans‐
fer from the surrounding seawater. However, such point measurements in tissue can be invasive
and are not representative of the complex 3D morphology and compartmentalization of corals (11),
which also includes intricate cilia‐driven external and internal flow patterns at the tissue surface
and in the gastric cavity of corals (12,13). Chemical imaging with optical sensor particles (e.g. 14,15)
offer an interesting alternative to such measurements.
While O2‐sensitive sensor particles have previously been applied for mapping the O2 concentration
and dynamics over the external tissue surface of corals (11,16,17) and aquatic plants (18), the map‐
ping of internal O2 concentration in living coral tissue and gastric cavities has so far not been real‐
ized. External application of sensor particles has the following complications in corals: (i) the re‐
sponse to changes in O2 can be rather slow particularly for larger particles >5‐ 10 µm); (ii) mucus
production can bind and slowly remove the particles from the coral surface and may also influence

the measurements; (iii) O2 mapping inside the tissues is not possible as the mucus and epidermal
tissue acts as a barrier.

Figure 1. Schematic drawing of the setup used for injecting O2 sensor nanoparticles into the gas‐
trovascular cavity of coral polyps and subsequent mapping of the internal O2 concentration with a
luminescence lifetime system. The inset shows a coral polyp, where a glass microcapillary is intro‐
duced through the coral mouth into the gastrovascular cavity for injection of sensor nanoparticles,
that can then distribute to neighboring polyps via channels in the connective tissue (see also
SVIDEO 1). A laser pointer was used to locally stimulate photosynthetic O2 production.
Oxygen nanosensors represent analytical tools, which can help to overcome the above limitations
(19,20). Sensor nanoparticles can be injected directly into the tissue, and due to their small size the
sensor particles respond virtually instantaneous to changing O2 concentration. However, because
of strong light scattering and absorption in tissues, luminescent sensors relying on UV‐blue exci‐
tation and emission in the visible spectral range are poorly suitable for mapping O2 inside tissues.
As an alternative, optical indicators emitting in the NIR are promising materials for imaging O2 in
tissues (21). Such sensor materials are often based on dendrimers containing a phosphorescent
benzoporphyrin complex as a core (22,23,24). Alternatively, polymeric nanoparticles can be doped

with a lipophilic O2 indicator (25). Similarly to the shell of a dendrimer, the polymeric material
protects the indicator from undesired interferences (e.g. quenchers, ionic species etc.) and controls
O2 permeability. This approach was preferred in the current work because of high flexibility in
tuning the sensitivity of the probe and its spectral properties and the simplicity of the preparation
methods (26). Furthermore, the indicator material is commercially available from several provid‐
ers. Here we describe optical O2 sensor particles that are suitable for internal, subsurface O2 meas‐
urements in coral tissue and show their application in combination with luminescence lifetime
imaging for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of O2 concentration within the tissues of two
reef‐building coral species.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Reagents and chemicals
Luminescent oxygen indicator platinum(II)‐tetra(4‐fluoro)phenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPT‐
BPF) was prepared according to the previously published procedure (27). Poly(methyl methacry‐
late‐co‐methacrylic acid) (PMMA‐MA; 10% methacrylic acid, MW ~100,000) was from Pol‐
ysciences, Warrington, USA. The organic solvents were from Roth (Germany).
Preparation of nanoparticles
Oxygen‐sensitive nanoparticles were prepared according to a previously published procedure (26).
Briefly, 3 mg of PtTPTTBPF and 200 mg of PMMA‐MA were dissolved in 40 mL of tetrahydrofuran
and the solution was diluted to 100 mL with acetone. Then, 700 mL of water was added within 2‐3
s under vigorous stirring. The organic solvents and most water were removed under reduced pres‐
sure. The aqueous dispersion was concentrated to contain about 20 mg mL‐1 of particles.
The size and surface charge (Zeta‐potential) of the sensor particles were measured via dynamic
light scattering (DLS) on a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern, UK).
Imaging setup
The imaging of O2 concentration was done with a modular luminescence lifetime imaging system
(28,29), which encompasses a fast gate‐able CCD camera (1280 x 1028 pixels; SensiCam‐SensiMod,
PCO/Excelitas, Kehlheim, Germany), 2 high power LED excitation light sources (617 nm; Roitner
LaserTechnik GmbH, Vienna, Austria) to provide homogeneous excitation of the sample., and a
custom built trigger unit to synchronize excitation light exposure and image acquisition over de‐
fined time intervals. The camera was equipped with a macro lens (1.4/17 CCTV, Xenoplan, Schnei‐
der‐Kreuznach, Germany) equipped with distance rings (5 mm + 0.5 + 1 mm) for higher magnifi‐
cation. With the chosen objective, the achieved field of view was about 2.5 x 2 cm yielding a reso‐
lution of 20 µm per pixel. A 720 nm long‐pass filter (R‐720; Edmund Optics, Barrington, USA) in
combination with a plastic filter (“bright red”; Lee Filters, UK) was mounted in front of the lens.
Given sufficient luminescence signal, the imaging system can acquire O2 images with a time reso‐
lution of ~0.5 s (28).
The rapid lifetime determination method was used to calculate the luminescence decay time, , by
measuring luminescence intensities in two windows (1‐41 µs and 26‐66 µs after the excitation, re‐
spectively). The decay time, i.e., the luminescence lifetime was calculated as (28):



t2  t1
ln(I1 / I 2 ) ,

where t1 and t2 is the time corresponding to the start of the 1st and the 2nd window, respectively (1
and 26 µs in our setup), and I1 and I2 are the luminescence intensities within the respective time
windows.
Calibration of the O2‐sensitive nanoparticles
A dispersion of the nanoparticles was placed inside a custom‐made aluminium flow‐through
chamber equipped with a glass window. The cell was sparged with gas mixtures and the dispersion
was stirred using a magnetic stirring bar for faster gas exchange. The gas mixtures were prepared
from nitrogen (99.999% purity, Linde Gas, Austria) and compressed air using a gas mixing devices
(Red‐y, Aesch, Switzerland & Gasmixer, Sensor‐Sense, Netherlands). The temperature of the cell
and the gas mixtures was kept constant at 26 °C.
Sample preparation and experimental setup
Symbiont bearing corals Goniastrea sp. and Pocillopora damicornis were sampled from the reef flat
off Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. After sampling, the corals were kept at Heron Island
Research Station in an outdoor aquarium continuously flushed with aerated seawater from the reef
flat. Prior to the experiments a coral specimen was transferred to a flow chamber flushed with
aerated seawater (pH ~ 8.1) at 26 °C and at a flow rate of approximately 3 cm s‐1. The dispersion of
the nanoparticles was injected through a glass capillary into the mouth opening of a single coral
polyp under stagnant conditions (Fig. 1). The injection process was monitored under a dissection
microscope (SM‐6TZ‐54S; Amscope, Irvine, USA) equipped with a CCD camera. To visualize the
channel network connecting individual polyps in the coral colony, we also injected India ink using
a similar procedure (see SVideo 1). The coral was left in the flow chamber for several hours prior to
imaging experiments.
Stimulation of photosynthesis activation of the coral colony samples was performed by repeating
excitation of the coral with the light from the red LEDs used for image acquisition. Under constant
LED illumination, the incident photon irradiance reached 1100‐1200 µmol photons m‐2 s‐1, as meas‐
ured with a mini scalar irradiance sensor (US‐SQS/L; Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) connected
to a light meter (ULM‐500; Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). Under pulsed illumination via the
camera system, the illumination time is roughly only 1/5 of the total time and the incident photon
irradiance level was thus ~220‐240 µmol photons m‐2 s‐1. Local activation of symbiont photosyn‐
thesis in single coral polyps was performed with a red laser pointer (660 nm) for 1, 3, 6 and 10 min
with a photon irradiance of 350 µmol photons m‐2 s‐1.
Data processing
Image processing of the acquired images was done in Matlab 7.10 (Mathworks, USA) to obtain
pseudocolor O2 concentration images based on the measured luminescence lifetime images and
the calibration.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Oxygen‐sensitive nanoparticles
To be suitable for sub‐surface imaging of O2 distribution in coral tissue, the O2 nanosensors should
fulfil the following requirements: (i) be dispersible in water; (ii) be small enough to be distributed
within the coral after injection; (iii) possess excitation and emission in the red and NIR part of the
spectrum to minimize the light loss in the tissue due to absorption and scattering; (iv) have good
luminescence brightness enabling low to moderate excitation light levels to minimize actinic ef‐
fects (e.g. stimulation of algal photosynthesis) during the measurements; and (v) possess a suitable

dynamic range rate ranging from anoxia to O2 concentrations significantly exceeding air saturation,
i.e., mimicking the O2 dynamics experienced by corals in their tissue during day‐night cycles (9).
Based on the above requirements, we designed a new nanoparticle sensor material for O2 measure‐
ments in coral tissues (Fig. 2). The nanoparticle sensors are composed of the O2‐sensitive dye,
platinum(II) tetra(4‐fluorophenyl)tetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPTBPF)(27), incorporated into
poly(methyl methacrylate‐co‐methacrylic acid) (PMMA‐MA) nanoparticles via precipitation (26).
The dye absorbs in the blue and in the red part of the spectrum and shows phosphorescence in the
NIR region (Fig. 2a). These spectral properties make the sensor nanoparticles well suited for intra‐
tissue measurements. Moreover, the O2 indicator possesses very good luminescence brightness
(i.e., the product of molar absorption coefficient  and the luminescence quantum yield QY). In‐
deed,  = 146,000 M‐1cm‐1 for the Q band (615 nm) (26) and the QY is about 21% (30).

The charged groups, which are present in the copolymer (methacrylic acid), enabled us to prepare
nanoparticles that disperse well in water. This was achieved by using a simple precipitation
method, where the O2 sensitive dye and the polymer are first dissolved in an organic solvent (tet‐
rahydrofurane/acetone mixture) and are then precipitated by fast addition of water, with subse‐
quent removal of the solvents and partly water under reduced pressure. The resulting nanoparti‐
cles are rather small (ZAV ~65 nm, as determined by DLS measurements; SFig. 1) and negatively
charged (Zeta potential of – 25 mV). Preliminary experiments with other nanoparticles, i.e., cati‐
onic Rl‐100 beads (31) showed that they are unsuitable for measurements in seawater due to strong
aggregation in presence of high salt concentration.
The sensitivity of the O2‐sensing material is mostly determined by i) the luminescence decay time
of the indicator (0 about 54 µs in the absence of O2 for PtTPTBPF), and ii) the O2 permeability of
the polymer matrix. In our sensor nanoparticles, the O2 permeability of PMMA‐MA is lower than
e.g. in commonly used polystyrene‐based sensor nanoparticles or planar optodes (15). Conse‐
quently, the sensor particles exhibit a sufficiently strong change in luminescence at O2 concentra‐
tion exceeding air saturation. A Stern‐Volmer plot of the quenching properties of the sensor parti‐
cles (Fig. 2b) shows that they are suitable for measurements at 0 to >200% air saturation. The non‐
linear Stern‐Volmer response was well described by the “two‐site model” (32) assuming localiza‐
tion of the indicator in two significantly different environments. Assuming the negligible quench‐
ability of the indicator in the second site and extending the fit to the luminescence decay time
(albeit without any physical meaning) the following equation can be used:

f

 
1 f

(2)

where f and KSV are the fraction of the total emission and the Stern‐Volmer constant for the first
site, respectively. Fitting Eq. 2 to our calibration data showed an excellent fit (r2 = 0.999) yielding
values of f = 0.80 and KSV = 0.0075 % air saturation‐1.
Nanoparticle injection and distribution
A solution of nanoparticles dispersed in seawater was injected through a glass capillary directly
into the mouth and gastric cavity of the coral, where they distributed inside the coral gastrovascu‐
lar canal system connecting neighbouring polyps (Fig. 1). In this study we aimed to fill the gastro‐
vascular cavity with sensor materials by continuing the injection until we could see particles com‐
ing out of the neighbouring polyps (SVideo 1). In the coral Pocillopora damicornis, the intensity in
the injection point remained high for several hours (SFig. 2), whereas with the larger polyps of
Goniastrea sp. a more homogeneous particle distribution was achieved within several minutes after
the injection (Fig. 3). This probably reflects differences in the connectivity between individual
polyps as well as different skeletal architecture and internal dimensions of the gastric cavities in
the different coral species (33,34). Mucus produced during the injection were removed by the water
flow, but the injected particles were retained within the coral tissue even after 24h, while no parti‐
cles were evident on the external tissue surface of the corals. This is in contrast to magnetic micro‐
particles used in previous work to map the O2 conditions on the external coral tissue surface (16),
which were partially trapped and slowly carried away with mucous when water flow was applied.

Oxygen dynamics in corals after nanoparticle injection
Figure 3 shows NIR (780 nm) luminescence intensity images and the corresponding subsurface O2
distribution in the coral Goniastrea sp., as derived from luminescence lifetime imaging, recorded
immediately after the injection of sensor particles and during longer periods in darkness. Initially
the coral polyps contracted and the coral tissue was hypoxic (about 5% and 20% air saturation for
the coral mouth tissue and tentacles, respectively). Over the course of 2‐3 hours in darkness, the
coral tissue expanded as the mouth opened and tentacles stretched out into the overlying seawater.
While initially highly concentrated in the mouth tissue, the sensor nanoparticles also became more
dispersed within the coral tissue during this time, presumably by a combination of diffusion and
active transport in the gastrovascular channels via cilia‐induced advective transport (13,35).
The small size of the sensor nanoparticles also enables their dispersion from the gastric cavity into
the coral tissue. In Pocillopora damicornis, we found that the O2 concentration in the upper tissue
layer was different than when focusing into deeper tissue layers (Fig. S1). This indicates the pres‐
ence of an O2 gradient, which was measured with sensor nanoparticles distributed within the tis‐
sue and in the gastrovascular system. However, our macroscopic imaging system was not optimized
for precise z‐stacking, and a more precise 3D quantification of the O2 distribution in corals would
require more sophisticated imaging systems such as confocal or light sheet microscopes (36). Fur‐
thermore, such high resolution measurements would also enable a more precise mapping of the
nanoparticle distribution in the sample.
In Goniastera sp., the sensor nanoparticles showed a tendency to accumulate in the tentacles (Fig.
3g,j), and the O2 concentration increased to 60 and 100% air saturation in the coral mouth tissue
and tentacles, respectively, in darkness. The higher availability of O2 within tentacles can be ex‐
plained by their higher surface area to volume ratio securing a more efficient O2 supply from the
surrounding seawater (8).
The observed uneven distribution of luminescence intensity could be due to a heterogeneous dis‐
tribution of nanoparticles or may be due to the orientation of the tentacles in direction of the
camera lens with scattering effect within the tentacles so that the emission light is mostly outcou‐
pled directly from the tentacle tips. While such heterogeneity, in combination with a strong auto‐
fluorescence of coral host pigments and chlorophyll in the microalgal symbionts, would severely
complicate ratiometric imaging of O2, the time‐domain luminescence lifetime imaging approach
enabled us to map the O2 distribution without such interferences.
Light‐dark O2 dynamics in Goniastrea sp. coral
We stimulated the photosynthetic O2 production of the symbiotic microalgae in the coral Goni‐
astrea sp. with red light from the high power LED used for lifetime imaging. Figure 4 and 5 show
the resulting O2 dynamics during the light activation phase and subsequent relaxation in darkness.
We found a fast response in the subsurface O2 concentration in the coral tissue within a few sec‐
onds after onset of light or dark conditions. Even faster O2 dynamics within a few seconds after a
change in light conditions has previously been measured via point measurements with O2 mi‐
crosensors (9).
A more detailed analysis of the O2 dynamics in specific regions of interest (ROI) 1 and 2 (outlined
in Fig. 4b) showed initially higher oxygenation in the tentacles compared to the coral mouth, fol‐
lowed by a decrease of the oxygenation to similar values (about 130% air saturation) during the
activation. Interestingly, analysis of the light‐dark shifts shows that the O2 content rapidly dropped
to about 35% air saturation and then gradually increased again to 50‐80% air saturation.

In the second experiment we doubled the photon flux (220‐240 µmol photonsm‐2s‐1) and observed
a further increase in the oxygenation up to 200% air saturation (Fig. 5b). Again, a minimum O2
concentration was reached after 300s in darkness, after which the O2 concentration increased to
about 65% air saturation. This dynamic can indicate significantly higher metabolic activity of the
corals directly after the activation, e.g. via enhanced light and post‐illumination respiration (37).
Alternatively, the initial drop in O2 concentration could also reflect a rapid local consumption,
where the O2 concentration drop gradually becomes alleviated by circulating water in the gastro
vascular canals in the coral colony (13).

tion of O2 via respiration after onset of darkness was similar in different polyps (Fig. 7).

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
We showed that O2‐sensitive nanoparticles based on a NIR luminescent indicator represent prom‐
ising tools for macroscopic in vivo imaging of the internal O2 dynamics in corals. The sensor na‐
noparticles can be injected via the coral mouth and are distributed within the coral tissue via a
network of gastro vascular canals connecting individual polyps in the coral colony. Lifetime imag‐
ing enables non‐invasive mapping of the internal O2 distribution in different parts of the corals
without interference from background fluorescence, and the red excitation and NIR emission of
the sensor nanoparticles ensured good tissue penetration. A similar approach using other types of
sensor nanoparticles suitable for aquatic systems (15) can be used for mapping other relevant pa‐
rameters such as the internal pH or temperature distribution in corals, which are additional key
factors affecting coral health. Such measurements are key to improve our understanding of how
coral tissue structure and plasticity regulate the internal chemical microenvironment and meta‐
bolic activity of corals and their endosymbionts – and how they are affected by environmental
stress such as ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation.
In this proof‐of‐concept paper, we focused on 2D macroscopic imaging covering larger coral tissue
areas. We are now working on extending such measurements with higher resolution 3D lumines‐
cence lifetime imaging on suitable microscope platforms. Such measurements will enable a more
detailed description of the internal O2 distribution relative to the water‐filled gastric cavity and
the tissue layers of the coral.
Our experimental approach can also be adapted for O2 mapping in other natural systems such as
biofilms, plant and animal tissues, as well as in organoids and other cell constructs, where imaging
internal O2 conditions are relevant but challenging due to high optical density and background
fluorescence.
