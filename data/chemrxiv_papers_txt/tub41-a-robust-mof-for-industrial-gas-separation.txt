Herein, we report on the thermal and chemical stability and CO2 and water vapor adsorption of a mixed
linker phosphonate-MOF [Cu(4,4’‐bpy)0.5(1,4‐NDPAH2)], namely TUB41 (bpy = bipyridine and
NDPAH4 = naphthalenediphosphonic acid). TUB41 exhibits reversible phase transitions upon heating
until 330 °C. TUB41 is a very stable MOF across a pH range of 1 to 11 and after two years of repeated
adsorption experiments and activation at 80 °C and ambient humidity. While gases with larger kinetic
diameter do not access the narrow pores of TUB41, it can efficiently adsorb CO2 and water vapor, which
have smaller kinetic diameter compared to other atmospheric gases. TUB41 exhibits a moderate enthalpy
of adsorption for CO2, which is favorable compared to water vapor at low pressure, indicating its potential
for selective CO2 separation in the presence of water vapor. TUB41 has an estimated optical band gap
between 2.7 and 3.0 eV, which is within the bluish-violet range.

1. Introduction
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved as one of the most studied material classes
with a wide range of potential industrial applications in medicine, food chemistry, catalysis,
energy storage, and many others. 1-4 For each application, MOFs must possess unique chemical
and thermal stability suitable for the desired application. For example, biodegradability is an
essential requirement for MOFs to be used for applications such as drug delivery,5-9 while
MOFs intended for use in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis (including hydrogen
evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, or HER and OER, respectively), CO2 capture, and
water harvesting must demonstrate sufficient stability to survive in the presence of electrolytes,
water, and acidic or basic environments.10 Despite, the rich structural diversity of MOFs and
their vast potential applications,2 there still is only a handful of MOFs in the literature, which
are considered to be stable in the presence of water, acids, bases and electrolytes.11,12 Notably,
UiO-66, which is known for its exceptional stability, has a shelf lifetime of ca. 2 months at
room temperature and ambient humidity.13,14 Therefore, the development of next-generation
stable MOFs will be the most significant breakthrough that will finally open the gateway
towards the industrial application of MOFs. The secondary building units (SBUs) of
conventional carboxylate MOFs are usually composed of water-labile metal carboxylate
clusters, including Zr(IV) carboxylate clusters (as in UiO-66), which limit conventional MOF
applications in aqueous medium.14 Furthermore, a CO2 adsorption process also generates an
acidic environment, which is challenging for conventional MOFs to survive for a long period
of time.15 Therefore, we have recently focused on the development of chemically stable
unconventional organic linkers, that can generate high affinity metal binding to create water
insoluble SBUs, that are resistant to hydrolysis in aqueous environment. For example,
phosphonic acids are very robust organic linkers surviving in the presence of concentrated acids,
and the P-C bond is known to be stable in the presence of UV-light and high temperature.16,17
Furthermore, phosphonates are known to produce non-soluble salts with transition metal
ions.16,18,19
Metal phosphonates have been emerging as a versatile MOF family, demonstrating exceptional
chemical stability across a wide range of conditions.20-22 Our group and others have reported
the stability of early phosphonate-MOFs in harsh environments, including strong acids, bases,
and even aqua regia, making them highly promising candidates for diverse applications such as
electrocatalysis, energy storage, and sequestration of greenhouse gases.16,21,23,24 Additionally,
our investigations into hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) and polyphosphonate

covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed from phosphonic acids have shown
exceptional stability in humid environments during and after proton conductivity
experiments.25-28 It has been also shown that metal phosphonates might be electrically
conductive.4,29,30 Despite these developments in the field, there are only a few phosphonateMOFs that have been reported in the literature, and the further development of phosphonateMOFs remains constrained by the limited commercial availability of arylphosphonic acid
linkers and fundamental phosphonate precursors.20 Addressing these challenges is significant
to establish novel sustainable MOF families that are stable in the presence of harsh chemical
environment for applications such as batteries, CO2 capture, electrocatalysis, etc.
In this work, we wanted to focus on naphthalene as a linker core, which is a fundamental
hydrophobic and polyaromatic moiety to create MOFs that might capture hydrophobic gases.31
Previously, we published a structural report on TUB41, which was a mixed-linker MOF
utilizing 1,4-naphthalenediphosphonic acid (1,4-NDPAH4) and 4,4’-bipyridine (4,4’-bpy) (See
Figure 1a).32 Due to its very low yield, we were not able to work on its applications previously.
TUB41 has narrow hydrophobic pores, which are suitable for sequestering molecules with
small kinetic diameters such as CO2 and H2O. In this work, we were able to synthesize TUB41
hydrothermally as a single product phase and we explored its chemical and thermal stability.
We furthermore used it to capture CO2, and explored its optical properties.32 We have also
shown that TUB41 has a shelf lifetime of beyond 2 years after repeated gas adsorption and
activation at 80 °C under vacuum, which is a strong improvement compared to the conventional
carboxylate-based MOFs such as UiO-66 (2 months).

In more detail, as shown in Figure 1b, TUB41 has a rod-shaped SBU composed of typical eight
membered Cu-O-P-O-Cu-O-P-O rings observed in phosphonate MOFs, which are bridged by
the square pyramidal Cu(II) atoms, while the hydrogen bonding between the Cu(II)
coordinating phosphonate groups defines the final shape of the SBU and provides an
hydrophilic character to the SBU. On the other hand, hydrophilic hydrogen bonded SBUs of
TUB41 are surrounded by hydrophobic naphthalene moieties hypothetically limiting the noncovalent interactions of the SBU with hydrophilic gases, and generating a more suitable
environment for hydrophobic gases such as CO2. Recently, MOF research has focused on
frameworks with narrow pore sizes to enhance gas adsorption selectivity.33 The combination of
narrow pore sizes and the hydrophobic nature observed in TUB41, along with its thermal and
chemical stability, makes it highly desirable for the development of industrial applications of
MOF that can selectively capture or separate hydrophobic gases such as CO2. 34,35
2. Chemical Stability of TUB41

Figure 2. a) PXRD (Cu Kα radiation) of TUB41 at different pH, and b) at different temperatures
and after adsorption experiments.
The crystals of TUB41 were reproduced in Fall 2022. Chemical stability tests of TUB41 were
performed by suspending TUB41 crystals in aqueous solutions with different pH in HCl
between 1 and 13 for 2 hours. In addition, TUB41 samples were left in the hydrothermal
reaction mixture for 1 month before the purification of the crystals that indicates its stability in
aqueous medium of pH 2.5 for ca. one month. As depicted in Figure 2a, the powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) data of the acid- and base-treated samples of TUB41 retains its PXRD
pattern between pH1 and pH 11 after 2 hours, suggesting its stability in acidic environment for

this period of time and basic environment at pH 11. The MOF sample treated at pH 13 starts to
decompose, although the sample retains some of the original PXRD pattern. It has been
predominantly converted into CuOH species, indicating relatively slow decomposition at pH
13. In addition, TUB41 was synthesized in Parr acid digestion reaction vessels in distilled water
at pH 1.5 (pH 2.5 after the reaction) and 120 °C for 48 hours, which also suggests the intrinsic
chemical stability of TUB41 in acidic environment.

TUB41, and the corresponding element mapping c) Cu d) P.
As can be seen in Figure 3, SEM pictures indicate that the crystals mostly retain their
morphology after two years of repeated adsorption experiments and storage at room
temperature and ambient humidity.
3. Thermal Stability of TUB41
In order to understand the thermal behavior of TUB41, we initially performed powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) of samples which were heated up to 300 °C for one-hour periods, and
5

collected the PXRD data after cooling them to room temperature (Figure. 2b). Phosphonic acids
condense at high temperatures to make P–O–P bonds and this also suggested by MS-TGA as
water evaporation is gradually observed above ca. 250 °C, TUB41 potentially leading to
crystalline metal polymeric framework at ca. 300 °C (See Figure 2 and MS-TGA section).28
TUB41 has a rod shaped SBU composed of corner-sharing continuous eight-membered Cu–O–
P–O–Cu–O–P–O rings (see Figure 1b).

Figure 4. a) In-situ VT-PXRD (Cu Kα radiation) in a staggered plot until 330 °C, showing no
drastic changes of the PXRDs over a long 2θ range. b) Contour plots of TUB41 from 25-330 °C
using the square-root scaling of the intensity, allowing us to follow changes in crystallinity and
phase transformations better. Dark areas correlate 2θ values to observed high intensity of
reflections.
To gather insights on the stability of the material after several years of cycling, we measured
in-situ variable temperature powder x-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD) using the two-year-old
crystals, which were repeatedly used in CO2 and water vapor adsorption measurements up to
330 °C. As it can be seen in Figure 4a, PXRD pattern remained very similar to the original
phase until 330 °C, while some minor phase transformations can be observed. The phase
transformation and the thermal stability of the compound is better observed in contour plots of
TUB41 in Figure 4b, with the dark areas showing crystalline, consistent Bragg reflections with
varying intensity continuing until 330 °C. At 2θ = 7.2° the most interesting reflex is observable,
which splits into two peaks above 120 °C and reverts above 250 °C, demonstrates the strongest
phase transformation, which dis- and re-appears above 280-330 °C infrequently. Between 14°
and 25° many smaller, but observable transformations occur. At 2θ = 14.4, 20.5, 21.8 and 22.4°
reflections are sharpening from temperatures above 80°C on, demonstrating higher crystallinity
of the sample until 330 °C (see Figure 4b). We previously summarized the conformational

changes in flexible rod shaped SBUs observed in phosphonate MOFs.36 The observed phase
transitions might be a result of the reversible conformational changes in the Cu–O–P–O–Cu–
O–P–O rings. As depicted in Figure 1b, the rod-shaped SBU of TUB41 has repeating hydrogen
bonds between the mono-deprotonated phosphonate-based hydrogen atom and Cu(II)coordinated phosphonate oxygen atoms. The thermal flexibility of the TUB41 might be
originating from the breaking and reforming of the hydrogen bonds leading to multiple SBU
conformations and phase transitions at different temperatures.

Figure 5. TGA-MS measurements in synthetic air for TUB41.
We have performed MS-coupled thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to understand the thermal
behavior of TUB41 (SI for instrumental details). As depicted in Figure 4, MS-TGA
measurements showed two distinct steps of mass loss, occurring at around 100 °C (11.5 %) and
around 150 °C (3.5 %), which is identified as loss of water. After ca. 250 °C decomposition is
observed, which is accompanied by a loss of water, probably due to the condensation of
phosphonic acid groups.28,37 This transition is also confirmed by the in-situ temperature variable
PXRD showing peaks after 200 °C, and more intensely after keeping the TUB41 crystals at
250 °C and 300 °C for longer period of time (See Figure 2b). At 400 °C still more than 75
mass-% of the sample remain, suggesting appreciable thermal stability of the organic linker
molecules while the structure has potentially changed to another less crystalline phase after
likely condensation of the phosphonic acids according to PXRD above 250 °C (see Figure 2b
and 4 left).

5. CO2 and water vapor adsorption studies
Both nitrogen and argon sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K, but showed only very low
adsorption (Figure S3) and a BET surface area of only ca. 4 m2/g. The CO2 sorption in Figure
6a showed a higher adsorption and distinct hysteresis over the whole pressure range, indicating
positive attractive interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate. The hysteresis looks closest to
type H4,38 further strengthening the hypothesis of small, narrow pores with a polar internal
surface. BET calculations using the CO2 adsorption isotherm at 273 K gave a surface area of
60 m2/g and a total pore volume of 0.019 cm3/g still showing low porosity. By measuring
adsorption at three different temperatures, an estimation of the adsorption enthalpy was possible
by fitting the adsorption isotherms to a Langmuir-Freundlich expression (Figure S1) and using
the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (1):39
𝑝$
𝑇% 𝑇$
Δ𝐻!"# (𝑛) = −𝑅 ln + 𝑝% (𝑇$ − 𝑇% )
(1)
with n as the loading in units of mol ∙ g-1, R = 8.314 J ∙ K-1 ∙ mol-1 as the gas constant, p1 and p2
as two reference pressures and T1 and T2 as the respective reference temperatures. The enthalpy
of adsorption for low loadings was thus calculated as –41 kJ/mol for an adsorbed amount of
0.01 mmol ∙ g-1 CO2.
Water vapor sorption measurements at 283, 288, and 293 K showed adsorption with a slight
concave curvature in the low-pressure region and a very strong hysteresis closest to type H2
(see Figure 6b).38 Desorption at measurement temperatures was not complete, showing strong
interactions and polar surfaces, but since the same sample was used for all sorption
measurements, it is shown that the activation procedure between measurements, 80 °C for 2 h
under vacuum, was sufficient to empty the pores. The overall adsorption is still not very high,
fitting with the already measured limited porosity, but much higher than anticipated from the
nitrogen adsorption measurements only, again indicating very small pores only accessible to
molecules with a smaller kinetic diameter and at higher temperatures. At relative pressures
between 0.7 and 0.8, inter-particle condensation began, leading to a strong increase in the
amount of adsorbed water.
The enthalpy of adsorption of water was also calculated according to the same procedure as for
CO2. For computational purposes, only the low-pressure region before condensation was used.
This approach resulted in a value of –38 kJ/mol for the enthalpy of adsorption for a loading of
0.7 mmol/g (pressure of 2 ∙ 10-3 bar). This high loading compared to the loading with CO2 was
8

chosen due to lower accuracy within the low-pressure region for water sorption and the
available measurement points (Figure S2). The heat of adsorption increases with increasing
pressure, probably caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds between adsorbed water
molecules. Comparison to the heat of adsorption of CO2 is difficult and further complicated by
the difference between a gas and vapor, but apparently are in a similar range and both show
attractive interaction with the pore surface. Despite a potentially preferential adsorption for CO2
molecules based on the adsorption heat data, the material exhibited a higher mass of water vapor
adsorption (0.04 g/g) compared to CO2 adsorption (0.017 g/g), which might be due to the
smaller kinetic diameter of water molecules (2.65 Å) compared to CO2 (3.3 Å) in the gaseous
phase. Another reason for the higher water adsorption might be due to the condensation of water
molecules between the TUB41 crystals, which usually happens at higher relative pressures.
The total number of MOFs that are more selective for CO2 in the presence of water vapor is
very limited in the literature as MOFs usually have higher affinity for water vapor due to the
presence of hydrophilic moieties.15,40 Although the amount of adsorbed CO2 is limited in
TUB41 due to its small surface area, it still has a unique place among other MOFs with its
narrow and selective pores limiting competition with gases having larger kinetic diameters (e.
g. nitrogen (3.64 Å) and methane (3.8 Å) in atmosphere and naphthalene moieties provide more
hydrophobic nature to the pores providing a more suitable enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 gas
compared to the water vapor.

desorption) (n) Water vapor sorption isotherms at 283, 293 and 303 K (filled symbols

All sorption measurements combined confirm the existence of very small pores, which are not
accessible for both nitrogen and argon due to their higher kinetic diameter and the cryogenic
measurement temperatures (see Figure S3). Ar has a slightly higher kinetic diameter of 3.4 Å
compared to CO2 which has a kinetic diameter of 3.3 Å.41 Therefore, the upper limit for gases
to enter the pores of TUB41 is between 3.3 Å and 3.4 Å. This narrow margin for CO2 adsorption
might have provided the optimum non-covalent multi-site interactions between the TUB41
pores and CO2, which in return generated a favorable enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 compared
to water that has much smaller kinetic diameter, upon entering the TUB41 pores. Furthermore,
the naphthalene moieties of TUB41 block the interaction of water molecules with the
hydrophilic SBU and the mono deprotonated phosphonate groups, preventing strong hydrogen
bonding interactions that could have otherwise favored the water vapor adsorption in the narrow
pores of TUB41.
6. Optical properties

Figure 7. a) Indirect band gap and b) direct band gap of TUB41
Copper phosphonate MOFs such as TUB1, TUB40 and TUB75 are sister compounds of TUB41
and known for their semiconducting properties, which is also seen in other phosphonate
MOFs.29,42-44 Thus, we measured the diffuse reflectance spectrum of TUB41 to estimate the
band gap of this compound (see Figure 7a and b). According to Tauc plots generated from the
diffuse reflectance spectra, an indirect band gap of 2.7 eV or direct (optical) band gap of 3.0 eV
can be estimated (see SI for experimental details).45,46 The additionally visible band at around
1.7 eV can be related to a localized 3d9 ← 3d9 transition of the Cu(II) centers (2E ← 2T2 in an
approximately tetrahedral field). TUB41 has a very similar SBU compared to our previously

reported MOF TUB1. The SBUs in both TUB1 and TUB41 have the same order of vertexconnected [Cu–O–P–O–Cu–O–P–O] eight-membered rings resulting in a rod shaped SBU (See
Figure 1b).44 The major difference between the SBUs of TUB41 and TUB1 is the first copper
atom (Cu1) in TUB1, which is coordinated in a square-planar fashion, while the second copper
atom (Cu2) is coordinated in a square-pyramidal fashion. In TUB41 all copper atoms show a
square-pyramidal coordination sphere. Similar to TUB41, our previously published MOF
TUB1 provided an indirect band gap of 2.4 eV and a direct band gap of 2.7 eV in a similar
range, which was also confirmed by DOS calculations.44 The slightly narrower band gap
observed in TUB1 might be due to the presence of square planar coordinated Cu(II) ions as
indicated by the calculations in the previous work. These resulting indirect and direct band gaps
in TUB41 are within the visible range indicating the potential use of TUB41 in photocatalysis.

Conclusions
TUB41 stands out among other MOFs due to its unique stability, combination of narrow,
selective hydrophobic pores that limit competition with gases having larger kinetic diameter
than 3.3 Å. We were able to observe the stability of TUB41 over a two years period. TUB41
provides stability at pH 2.5 for more than one month. It is also stable between pH 1 and pH 11
for at least two hours, and the crystals of TUB41 remained stable after repeated adsorption
experiments and activation at 80 °C under vacuum. One of the difficulties to capture CO2 is
the presence of water vapor, which intrinsically has a higher affinity for MOFs as they are
composed of hydrophilic metal binding functional groups. The naphthalene moieties
incorporated into the framework of TUB41 provide enhanced hydrophobicity to the pores,
resulting in a more favorable enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 compared to water vapor.
Additionally, TUB41 demonstrates exceptional chemical stability compared to the
conventional MOFs (which are often hydrolyzed in the presence of water vapor), particularly
in the presence of acids and bases between the pH range of 1 and 11, further enhancing its
potential for industrial applications, especially as membranes that can sieve CO2 molecules.
Furthermore, the rod shaped SBU provides reversible phase transitions to TUB41 observed at
different temperatures. In situ temperature variable PXRD combined with MS-TGA suggested
the condensation of phosphonate groups to release additional water molecules at higher
temperatures. From diffuse reflectance spectra, a band gap between 2.7 and 3.0 eV, within the
bluish-violet spectral range, is estimated. The selectivity of TUB41 for water vapor and CO2
11

gases and its band gap within the visible range makes TUB41 a suitable candidate for
applications such as photocatalytic water splitting and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.
Furthermore, conventional MOFs with metal carboxylate SBUs have relatively short shelf lives.
For example, UiO-66 have a shelf life of 2 months at room temperature and ambient humidity.
The remarkable thermal and chemical stability of TUB41 after two years of repeated use is a
significant development for industrial applications of MOFs. To the best of our knowledge,
TUB41 exhibits the longest stability among other MOFs, maintaining its structural integrity for
over two years and continuing to remain stable. The development of phosphonate-MOFs like
TUB41 composed of non-soluble SBUs and stability in concentrated acids and bases will be
key in developing next generation MOFs with the desired stability to perform applications
requiring the presence of aqueous solutions, acids, bases and aqueous electrolytes.
