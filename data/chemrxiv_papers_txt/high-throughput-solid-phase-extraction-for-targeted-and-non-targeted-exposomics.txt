ABSTRACT: Characterizing the chemical exposome relies on advanced instrumentation including tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS), and non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high-resolution MS.
However, proper sample pretreatment, balancing broad analyte coverage, method robustness, and throughput remain a major bottleneck in exposomics. Here, we developed a robust and scalable solid phase extraction (SPE) protocol in 96-well format for human urine and plasma and optimized it for a panel of 94 highly diverse environmental
and food-related contaminants (LogP -0.7 ~ 6.8). Extraction recoveries (RE) and signal suppression and enhancement (SSE) were determined using targeted LC-MS/MS. Acceptable REs (60% - 140%) were achieved for >70% of all
analytes, and acceptable SSE values (60% -140%) for 86% and 90% in urine and plasma, respectively. Subsequently,
the method was transferred to 96-well format, significantly improving throughput to meet the capacity requirements
needed for exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS). The established workflow is approximately 10× faster than
routinely used metabolomics-based protein precipitation approaches when comparing the estimated total analysis
time for 1000 samples. The method’s applicability for NTA and suspect screening was tested and compared to a generic protein precipitation protocol using NIST standard reference materials for urine (SRM 3672) and plasma (SRM
1950). Favorable performance was shown for the protein precipitation workflow while the SPE protocol demonstrated promising results. The developed workflow is thus not only superior for future high-throughput targeted
exposomics but also offers an option for NTA applications. The presented well-balanced approach is scalable and
also applicable to research in the fields of pharmacology, food safety, or systems toxicology.

Humans are consistently exposed to a myriad of chemicals
during their daily lives through various sources, including
dietary intake and environmental pollutants1-3. Exposomics
represents the comprehensive analysis of all environmental
and food-related exposures and associated influences on
various health outcomes4. To allow a full assessment of the
totality of chemical exposures in human samples, sensitive,
specific, and robust analytical techniques, such as liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
are required. Multi-class or next-generation human biomonitoring (HBM) methods have recently been developed
to monitor a wide range of environmental chemicals and are
needed to address the full complexity of chemical exposure5,
6. In contrast, non-targeted analysis (NTA) is an emerging
technique for exposomics using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and allows the exploration of unknown
chemicals in human samples7, 8. Furthermore, suspect
screening methods use large chemical databases and spectral libraries to prioritize detected features and annotate
compound identities9, 10. Both targeted and non-targeted
exposomic methods face significant challenges related to
complex biological sample matrices11, and ensuring repeatability and consistency across large sample sets is mandatory, especially when dealing with low-abundance analytes
(i.e. pg/mL levels or lower)12-14. Addressing these challenges in exposomics requires sophisticated optimization of
the entire analytical workflow, including sample preparation protocols. Efficient sample pretreatment before instrumental analysis can reduce interferences, separate, and
concentrate analytes in diverse matrices15, 16 and various
sample preparation techniques have been optimized to analyze the exposome. Liquid extraction (LE) and protein precipitation (PPT) are widely used extraction methods for
exposomics due to their comparably wide chemical coverage6, 17. However, these techniques are prone to preserve
matrix interferences which can hamper overall method performance due to limited sample clean-up.
Recently, solid phase extraction (SPE) got more attention as
an option for sample preparation in exposomics and is discussed as a promising approach for future large-scale applications, owing to its capability to reduce matrix effects
(ME), enhance sensitivity, and improve consistency in highthroughput studies18, 19. SPE has been frequently used for
the purification and extraction of various analytes from diverse sample matrices for HBM including urine20, blood21,
and various other biological matrices22, 23. However, a systematic development of an exposome-scale SPE method
compatible with both, targeted and non-targeted data acquisition strategies has rarely been performed. This challenge originates from the complexity of designing a balanced method with suitable method robustness and broad
chemical space coverage. Most existing SPE methods focused on a limited selection of targeted analytes to obtain
reliable protocols without assessing the potential coverage
for NTA24 due to the lack of certified reference standards,
which restricts their utility in NTA.
In this study, a targeted high-throughput sample pretreatment method using SPE cartridges was optimized to assure
the applicability of the workflow for urine and plasma samples. The predicted octanol-water partition coefficient
(logP) from PubChem (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was utilized to evaluate the chemical coverage in terms of analyte
lipophilicity of compounds in this study. Target analytes
with a wide range of physicochemical properties, including

polarity, presents a central challenge for SPE methods in
exposomics, due to varying analyte-sorbent interactions.
This issue is a key factor that needs to be addressed during
method development aiming for a comprehensive chemical
coverage. Here, 94 highly diverse analytes from multiple
toxicant classes including perfluorinated substances
(PFAS), plasticizers, personal care products, food processing by-products, pesticides, industrial chemicals, air
pollutants, disinfecting agents, mycotoxins, phytoestrogens
and phytotoxins were used to optimize an SPE protocol for
high-throughput applications. Optimization steps included
selecting SPE sorbents and sample buffers, optimizing
washing and elution steps, and improving efficiency. Subsequently, the protocol was transferred to 96-well plates, and
analytical performance and throughput capacity were rigorously tested. Finally, the potential for NTA was explored
using NIST standard reference materials (SRMs) for urine
and plasma. The results indicate the feasibility of the approach for scaling and large-scale exposome-wide association studies.
Experimental Section
Biological samples and chemicals.
Human pooled plasma was purchased from Innovative Research (Novi, MI, USA). Pooled urine was obtained from a
female volunteer who abstained from consuming food and
beverages stored in plastic containers, phytoestrogens rich
food, and cosmetics containing parabens for two days before sample collection14. Standard reference materials, including urine (SRM 3672) and plasma (SRM 1950) were obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Gaithersburg, USA) for NTA. Detailed information on standards, including selection and spiking levels
can be found in Tables S1-S4. The selection of target analytes and analyte classes was intended to be as broad as
technically feasible with differing structures, real-life exposure levels, and toxicological modes of action. It was based
on our previous studies on next-generation biomonitoring
(Jamnik et al. 2022)6.
Method development and optimization.
The sample pretreatment approach was developed and optimized in several steps. Initially, two universal SPE
sorbents, a commercial hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced
sorbent (HLB) from Waters and an in-house prepared
mixed-mode SPE sorbent, were compared. The mixed-mode
sorbent was prepared from two SPE sorbents, primary second amine (PSA) and C18 (PSA+C18), by mixing equal
weights before packing. Details of the preparation are described in the Supplementary Information (SI). Packed
SPE cartridges (HLB or PSA+C18) were then used to optimize the full processes including sample loading, washing,
and elution. A mixture of 94 reference standards was spiked
into urine, plasma, and H2O samples both before
("prespiked") and after ("postspiked") the SPE process. Analyte loss (%), extraction recovery (RE, %), and signal suppression and enhancement (SSE, %) were calculated based
on the peak areas from these "prespiked" and "postspiked"
samples.
Analyte loss was defined as the fraction of an analyte that
was not retained by the SPE sorbent. It was calculated as the
ratio of peak areas of the effluents collected during sample
loading and washing from “prespiked” samples compared
to peak areas of “postspiked” effluents. Analyte loss of 0%

was achieved for complete analyte retention, whereas completely unretained analytes are characterized by a loss of
100%.
The term extraction recovery (RE) was used to describe the
recovery of the full SPE process including loading, washing
and elution. Thus, RE was calculated as the ratio of peak areas of a "prespiked" and "postspiked" sample. Full analyte
recovery results in RE of 100%, whereas 0% indicates no
analyte recovery of the SPE procedure. RE greater than
100% indicate contamination or carryover introduced during sample preparation or sample injection.
Matrix effects in terms of signal suppression and enhancement (SSE) depend on the influence of the sample matrix on
the analyte’s signal intensity. This was calculated as the ratio of peak areas for “postspiked” samples to a standard in
pure solvent25. SSE values close to 100% indicate negligible
effects of the sample matrix on the detector response, which
is required for accurate analyte quantification.
To evaluate the method performance and provide a rationale for the individual optimization steps, the metrics described above were classified into three categories: "good,"
"acceptable," and "poor," as shown in Table S5. Noteworthy, they do not represent method validation criteria but are
used for method optimization.
Subsequently, the SPE method was applied to pooled human urine and plasma samples to test applicability to analyze human samples. Sample treatment was further streamlined and transferred from SPE cartridges to 96-well plates
to allow parallel sample extraction and maximize sample
throughput. Furthermore, the applicability of the developed
workflow for NTA and suspect screening was tested to further expand the coverage of the targeted biomonitoring assay.
SPE Sorbent Selection.
SPE cartridges with two different sorbent types, HLB and
PSA+C18, were considered and the stability and robustness
of the material were tested. For this purpose, loading, washing, and elution procedures were individually evaluated. In
this first evaluation, analytical standards in LC-MS grade
water (H2O) were used as samples to minimize influences of
the sample matrix. Analyte loss (%) for both SPE sorbents
was tested using H2O or 2% methanol (MeOH/H2O, 2/98,
v/v) for sample loading and washing. Subsequently, RE for
diverse elution solvents were compared including 3% formic acid in methanol (FA/MeOH, 3/97, v/v), 3% ammonia
in MeOH (NH3/MeOH, 3/97, v/v), and pure MeOH. Details
including conditioning of SPE sorbents, analyte spiking procedures and spiking levels, as well as calculations of the
trapping efficiency and RE, are reported in the SI.
Sample Buffer Selection Before Loading.
Urine and plasma are commonly used sample matrices for
HBM and, especially in the case of urine, varying concentrations of matrix components can influence analyte extraction. To ensure method reliability, commonly utilized buffers, PBS (pH 7.4, 200 mM) and NH4AC (pH 6.0, 2.5 M), and
pure H2O were tested for sample dilution before the SPE
cleanup. Based on the results of our previously published
work, a final dilution ratio of 2 was used26.
Optimization of Washing, Elution, and Reconstitution Steps.
Water was selected as the washing solvent and the required
volume was optimized by comparing the SSE of either

washing one or two times with 1 mL. MeOH was selected as
the primary component of the elution solvent due to its
widespread application in SPE processes27. Considering the
strong anion-exchange interactions of PSA with commonly
encountered acidic compounds in exposomics9, 28, a basic
MeOH solution (3% NH3) was used as the elution solvent to
compare the RE of the mixed-mode sorbent (PSA+C18). For
HLB, both acidic (3% FA) and basic MeOH (3% NH3) were
evaluated due to both anion and cation exchange properties
of HLB. Furthermore, MeOH and two commonly used solvents, acetonitrile (ACN) and isopropanol (ISO), and a mixture of MeOH/ACN/ISO (1/1/1, v/v/v), were evaluated as
elution solvents. The solvent mixture was selected based on
results obtained from urine samples. Elution volumes of
200 µL, 400 µL, and 800 µL were subsequently compared
using pooled urine samples as a matrix.
A typical workflow to improve detection limits is to evaporate raw extracts and reconstitute them in a defined volume. Despite its clear benefits for enhancing the detection
of low-abundant analytes, this step is rather time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of samples. To further enhance sample throughput and assess the
effect of evaporation and reconstitution, two workflows
were tested and compared. One set of SPE extracts was
dried using a CentriVap Vacuum concentrator (Labconco)
and reconstituted with 50% MeOH (MEOH/H2O, 1/1, v/v).
In contrast, a second set of extracts was diluted with H2O,
resulting in a final mixture of 50% MeOH for comparison.
The final concentrations in the extracts of both sets were
the same.
Method Transfer to 96-well Plates.
After the optimization, pooled urine and plasma were used
to test extraction and cleanup using the developed workflow for SPE cartridges. Then, the method was transferred
to a 96-well plate SPE packed with HLB (Waters Corporation, USA) and the following parameters: SPE plates were
conditioned with 1 mL of MeOH, followed by 1 mL of H2O.
Then, 400 μL of urine or plasma sample were mixed with
400 μL of PBS. The mixture was loaded on the SPE plate and
washed twice with 1mL of H2O each. Gravity flow was selected for sample loading onto SPE and washing to minimize
analyte loss. Analytes were eluted by gravity using 200 µL
of MeOH twice, for a total of 400 μL, with negative vacuum
by manifold before and after the elution to control the flow
rate no more than 3 drops per second. RE and SSE were calculated and compared to results determined for SPE cartridges to prove applicability for high-throughput applications.
Assessing the Potential of SPE for NTA and Suspect Screening.
SPE is a promising technology to enhance method performance for targeted applications, but systematic testing
about chemical coverage is a necessity before any potential
application in non-targeted analysis. The coverage of other
typically detected analytes in human samples and the effect
on signal intensities were evaluated by comparing results of
the novel 96-well-based SPE approach to results from a PPT
method29 as the reference method for non-targeted applications. SRM 1950 (plasma) and SRM 3672 (urine) were extracted with both workflows and were analyzed using LCHRMS for NTA. Unknown compounds were annotated using
publicly available spectral libraries and a set of 234 authentic analytical standards (Table S2) was spiked into samples
for compound identification and to test the method for

targeted screening. Results were reported based on well-established reporting schemes, with identified compounds reported with the highest confidence level (“level 1”: identified based on authentic chemical standards). Therefore,
standards were only spiked into extracts from the SPE process. Spiking levels of these standards are reported in Table
S4. After annotation, the effect of the sample preparation
method on relative feature intensities was compared. Results were further investigated as a function of retention
times and classifications of the annotated features. Details
are outlined in the SI.
Data Acquisition.
Targeted LC-MS/MS.
Front-end LC separation was performed using our previously published method6. Identical separation gradients
were used for LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS(/MS) using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II and a Thermo Scientific Vanquish Horizon, respectively. An Acquity HSST3 column (1.8 μm, 2.1×
100 mm, Waters) was used with gradient elution using a
flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and 0.3 mM ammonium fluoride in
H2O as eluent A and ACN as eluent B. Details are reported in
Table S6. A QTrap 6500+ mass spectrometer equipped with
an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Sciex) was operated using one of our previously published multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods with fast polarity switching6. Full method parameters including MRM transitions
and ESI parameters are provided in the SI.
Non-targeted HRMS(/MS).
An Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) was used for HRMS(/MS) measurements. Samples
were analyzed using full scan mode and AcquireX was used
to generate fragment spectra using a mass resolution of
120,000 at m/z 200, with full method parameters reported
in the SI.
Data Analysis
Quality Control.
Several types of QC samples were used to ensure reliable
results. A systems suitability test sample (SST) was measured before and after each analytical sequence to ensure favorable instrument performance (see SI and Table S7). In
addition, a multi-analyte reference standard mixture consisting of 94 highly diverse chemicals in pure solvent was
injected. Solvent blanks were used to monitor instrumental
background and carry-over and process blanks were used
to monitor background concentrations/contaminations.
Targeted Data Analysis.
RE and SSE values were evaluated for the set of 94 analytes6
using standards in neat solvent, pooled urine, and pooled
plasma. Peak integration was carried out using Multiquant
(v3.0.2, Sciex) and Skyline (v21.2.2.536, McCoss Lab)30. Calculation of RE and SSE was performed using Microsoft Office 365. Graphics were created by Origin 2021b (v9.8;
OriginLab Corporation).
Non-targeted Data Analysis.
Raw data acquired in polarity switching mode was split
based on the polarity using Freestyle (Thermo). Then, raw
data files were analyzed using MSDIAL (v5.2)31. Full data
processing settings including data extraction, peak picking,
compound identification, and alignment are reported in the
SI. To evaluate the qualitative analyte coverage for NTA and
suspect screening, MassBank of North America (MoNA,

https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/) was used as a spectral
library. Annotations were then classified based on the level
of confidence scheme according to Schymanski et al.32 using
confidence levels 1 (confirmed by authentic standards),
level 2 (confirmed by spectral library match), and level 3
(confirmed by spectral library match, but with isomeric
structures). Additional data analysis and visualization was
performed using Microsoft Office 365, Origin 2021b,
MetaboAnalyst (v6.0), and Inkscape (version 1.2.2;
Inkscape).
Results and Discussion
SPE Sorbent Selection.
Analyte loss was compared for both SPE sorbents and HLB
and PSA+C18 showed comparable performance (see Figure
S1). “Good” performance (analyte loss <10% during loading
and washing) was achieved for 90% of all analytes, whereas
“good” RE was achieved for 59% of all analytes using HLB
compared to 39% using the mixed-mode sorbent PSA+C18.
Analyte loss >5% was observed for six analytes with LogP
values between 1.7-3.2 when using the PSA+C18 for SPE,
whereas analyte loss >5% was only observed for a single
compound when using the HLB sorbent (see Figure S2).
Most analytes showed sufficient RE (50%-150%) using either of the two sorbents but RE<50% were observed for 15
analytes using the mixed-mode sorbent, whereas only six
analytes with RE<50% were observed using the HLB
sorbent. Consequently, the HLB was selected as the sorbent
material for further workflow optimization.
Buffer Selection for Sample Before Loading.
Subsequently, the buffer system used for sample loading
was optimized. As shown in Figure S3, >95% of all analytes
showed analyte losses <10% after diluting samples with
PBS buffer. This fraction dropped to 80% and 87% of the
analytes when using NH4Ac and H2O as dilution solvents.
Consequently, PBS was chosen as the sample buffer for further process optimization.
Washing, Elution and Reconstitution Optimization.
Thereafter, washing, elution and reconstitution steps were
optimized. Matrix effects were investigated in terms of SSE
(%) and results for the two tested washing protocols were
largely comparable (Figure S4). However, using two times
1 mL of H2O improved SSE by approximately 5% for most
analytes, especially for those with RT between 1.0 min and
7.0 min (Figure S5). Consequently, two washing cycles using 1 mL H2O each were used in the final protocol.
The use of acidic MeOH solutions (3% FA) as elution solvent
resulted in lower RE (<50% for most analytes), whereas
better RE (50%-150% for most analytes) was achieved using pure MeOH or basic MeOH (3% NH3) for elution. Six nonpolar compounds (LogP, 4.0 - 5.5) had surprisingly high RE
values >150% using the basic MeOH solution while only a
single compound had RE>150% using pure MeOH (Figure
S2 (F)). Thus, pure MeOH was selected as the elution solvent for further optimization. In addition, it should be noted
that basic solvents with high ammonia concentrations may
cause issues including unstable RTs and potential damage
to both the UPLC column sorbent and the UPLC system itself33. Different elution solvents (MeOH, ACN and ISO) were
compared and elution volumes were optimized. “Good” REs
were achieved for approximately 70% using MeOH for

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2gsrn-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5853-7431 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

elution, whereas this reduced to 39-62% when ACN, ISO or
a 1:1:1 mixture of all solvents was used (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Extraction recovery (RE, %) for 94 analytes in pooled
urine using HLB cartridges with different elution conditions
(A) and classification of the performance into three categories
(B) using methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (ACN), isopropanol
(ISO), and a mixture of ISO/MeOH/ACN (1/1/1, v/v/v). Panels
(C) and (D) show results for the optimization of the elution volume for MeOH (200 µL, 400 µL, and 800 µL). in the following
classification was used in (B) and (D): "Good": RE 60% - 140%,
"Acceptable": RE 20% - 60% or 140% - 180%, “Poor”: RE < 20%
or RE > 180%.

Solvent volumes were optimized for MeOH and 200 µL, 400
µL and 800 µL were tested for elution (see Figure 1 (C-D)).
Approximately 70% of compounds achieved “good” REs
when using 400 µL or 800 µL of MeOH for elution, whereas
this fraction dropped to 63% when eluting with 200 µL
MeOH. The smaller solvent volumes (200 µL) resulted in inefficient elution for around 10% of all analytes and 400 µL
(using 2 times 200 µL) was selected for further method optimization, as it represented a well-balanced compromise
between good RE and low solvent consumption. Regardless
of the elution conditions, certain highly polar compounds in
pooled urine were poorly retained on the SPE cartridges.
These compounds were primarily low-mass organic acids
such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furanoic acid, dibromoacetic
acid, dichloroacetic acid, bromoacetic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid and were only weakly retained by the reversed-phase (RP-)LC column and with the used method
(i.e., RT <1 min).
The effect of drying the raw extracts followed by reconstitution was investigated (see Figure S6), and diluting the
raw extracts resulted in improved recoveries, indicating the
need to consider the optimization of reconstitution steps
during method development. Approximately 6% of analytes
fell into the "acceptable" RE category when using drying and
reconstitution, compared to the dilution method. Potential
causes include short vortexing, the absence of sonication
steps, or the selection of the resuspension solvent containing 10% ACN in H2O (1/1, v/v). For example, the RE for 2tert-butylphenol decreased significantly from 99.7% with
dilution to 23% after drying and reconstitution. Furthermore, the study found an increased background signal for
certain plasticizers, such as bisphenol F and S, when using
drying and reconstitution. Consequently, a direct dilution

approach is clearly favorable in terms of simplicity and
speed, which are both required for high-throughput applications.
Transferring SPE Method from Cartridges to 96-Well Plate
Format.
For maximizing sample throughput, the SPE protocol was
transferred to 96-well plates (plate-based SPE) and performance was compared to the initially optimized cartridgebased SPE protocol. In total, 72% of all analytes fulfilled
the criteria for “good” RE when using the cartridge-based
protocol for extracting urine or plasma samples, and 86%
and 90% of the analytes were classified as “good” in terms
of SSE. When using 96-well plates, 71% and 60% of the analytes achieved “good” REs while 76% and 78% of all analytes obtained “good” SSE in urine and plasma, respectively.
Most analytes with “good” REs using the cartridge-based
workflow were also categorized as “good” using the 96-well
plate workflow for the extraction of urine, whereas the performance of the 96-well plate method was reduced for 12%
of the analytes in plasma. Similarly, the cartridge-based protocol outperformed the plate-based SPE method in 10% of
the cases in terms of matrix-induced SSE (see Figure S7).

Figure 2. Extraction recoveries (A) and signal suppression and
enhancement (SSE, %) (B) for 94 analytes in urine (yellow) and
plasma (blue) using the optimized protocol based on SPE 96well format. pOHBA, p-hydroxybenzoic acid; MBP, mono-butyl
phthalate; 2-Napht, 2-naphthol; PFOS, perfluorooctanesulfonic
acid.

In total, around 25% of the analytes were poorly extracted
from plasma and 20% from urine using the plate-based protocol. The observed discrepancies might be explained by
differences in the manufacturing process, including sorbent
packing, or differences in sample handling when working
with 96-well plates. In addition to weakly retained compounds (low-mass acids, see above), additional compounds
in plasma, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pOHBA), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), 2-naphthol (2-Napht) or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), were reported with “poor”
RE. This was due to their background levels being 2 to 10
times higher than the spiked levels. In general, RE and SSE
was only slightly better when using cartridges compared to
96-well plates (see Figure 2). Despite the slightly reduced
performance in selected examples, the application of 96well plates still holds promise for large-scale applications
due to its comparable performance to the cartridges in combination with notable improvement in sample throughput,
and handling. A schematic representation of the SPE workflow based on 96-well plates is presented in Figure 3 and
more details are given in Table S8. To assess the full potential for high-throughput applications, the total analysis time
of the 96-well plate-based SPE workflow was predicted for
the analysis of 1000 samples, and time estimates were compared to our routinely used PPT protocol29. The new plate-

based SPE protocol allows extracting 1000 biological samples within 3 days, whereas the same amount of samples
would require 29 days using a routinely used PPT workflow
as shown in Table S9.

mainly lipids with RT > 10 min were higher in the PPT extracts. Similar results were observed for SRM 3672 urine,
with polar compounds including amino acids and derivatives or organic acids with RT < 3 min showing higher AUCs
in PPT extracts compared to SPE. However, some key lowabundance biomarkers were observed with significantly
higher AUCs using SPE, like nicotine in urine (SRM3672)
and cocaine in plasma (SRM 1950, see Figure S8). Interestingly, no significant differences between PPT and SPE were
observed for major metabolites of nicotine and cocaine such
as benzoylecgonine35 for cocaine, and hydroxycotinine and
cotinine for nicotine.

non-targeted analysis (NTA). * The SPE protocol in 96-well formats is approximately 10× faster than a state-of-the-art protein
precipitation workflow when calculated for 1000 samples. The
-0.7 to 6.8 logP range indicates the workflow's ability to cover
chemicals with varying polarities.

Assessing the Potential of SPE for NTA and Suspect Screening.
While systematic optimization and characterization of sample preparation methods for targeted (multi-analyte) assays can be performed easily, full-performance comparison
for non-targeted applications is less straightforward. We
aimed to characterize the applicability of the developed SPE
method for NTA and suspect screening, by comparing performance to a well-established protein precipitation
method (PPT). Thus, extracts obtained with PPT and 96well plate-based SPE were analyzed using LC-HRMS(/MS)
(see Figure 3 (B)), and results were compared on the feature level. Extracts of NIST SRM 1950 (plasma) and SRM
3672 (urine) were analyzed on an LC-HRMS instrument.
Peak picking, feature alignment and compound annotation
were performed using MS-DIAL together with reference
mass spectra from MassBank of North America (MoNA).
Relative intensities were determined for annotated features
as the area under curve (AUC), and results of the PPT and
SPE workflows were compared for annotated and identified
features. Values of fold change (FC > 2) and significance (pvalue < 0.05) were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst34. Approximately 50% of the annotated features detected in SRM
1950 (plasma), showed significantly higher AUCs (FC > 2, pvalue < 0.05) when using the PPT workflow (see Table
S10). Yet, SPE extraction resulted in significantly higher signal intensities for 13% of the features, and 36% of the features were not significantly affected by the choice of sample
preparation. For SRM 3672 (urine), we observed significantly higher AUCs using PPT in 32% of cases, whereas 10%
were significantly enhanced using SPE, and 58% of annotated features were not significantly different (Table S11).
Figure 4 (A-B) shows results of the comparison of relative
feature intensities as fold changes of AUC as a function of
the RT, whereas results are summarized on the compound
class level in Figure 4(C). For SRM 1950 (plasma), higher
relative signal intensities in PPT extracts were observed for
polar compounds, mainly amino acids and organic acids
with RT <3 min, which is well in line with the results from
the targeted assay. Additionally, several nonpolar features,

peak areas of annotated features (confidence levels 1-3) in SRM
1950 plasma (A) and SRM 3672 urine (B) as a function of retention time as log2 fold change of the peak area, and summary
of the results based on the compound class (C).

Despite these differences, comparable results were obtained for a large fraction of features and diverse compound
classes including amino acids, carnitines, natural products,
or synthetic compounds such as medical drugs and pesticides. For instance, 16 drugs were detected with comparable AUCs in PPT and SPE extracts of SRM 3672 urine. Similarly, twelve drug-related features were detected in the
plasma with comparable AUCs using both methods.
In conclusion, the PPT workflow offers wider coverage of
annotated features, but comparable results were obtained
for many annotated compounds. In urine, the results were
comparable for 58% of annotated features detected in extracts using both methods. However, PPT extraction provided broader feature coverage for the analysis of plasma
samples, particularly endogenous polar metabolites,
whereas SPE extraction improved the detection of lowabundance exogenous compounds at the cost of losing several polar metabolites.
Limitations
While the established workflow is effective for most analytes in targeted multi-class analysis of human samples and
performs comparably well for a relative majority of analytes

in NTA, several limitations remain. The analytes selected for
method optimization were highly diverse and yet still represent only a limited subset of the known chemical exposome. Although analytes were selected with a special emphasis on covering a wide range of physicochemical properties, coverage needs to be further expanded for exposomescale work. A broader selection of compounds and wider
chemical coverage would be needed for a truly holistic representation of the exposome in future work. Moreover, certain analytes, especially polar acidic compounds, are partly
lost during the SPE process due to weak retention by the
sorbent, which was expected. Although different workflows
could address these specific shortcomings by targeting particular sets of analytes, conducting multiple measurements
to gather sufficient information is time-consuming. Therefore, achieving favorable performance in terms of comprehensive analyte coverage, efficient cleanup, and minimal
time consumption simultaneously is not always feasible and
not always required36.
Conclusion and Outlook
In conclusion, we present the development of a highthroughput SPE protocol based on 96-well format for faster,
cheaper, and more robust omic-scale exposure analysis.
This workflow was optimized comprehensively considering
a large scale of targeted analytes, and chemical coverage
was further compared with a validated PPT method to ensure sufficient analyte coverage for targeted LC-MS/MS and
non-targeted LC-HRMS applications. Despite reduced
method performance for very polar compounds, the comparison of SPE and PPT workflows clearly indicated that the
SPE method is a suitable candidate for large-scale NTA or
suspect screening applications, especially due to the outstanding enhancement of sample throughput and instrumental robustness. This is underlined by the comparable
overall performance of PPT and SPE workflows for a wide
range of analytes, especially when RP-LC is used as a frontend separation technique. A pragmatic balance between reduced matrix complexity and chemical coverage was
achieved, and due to the high sample throughput, the presented workflow can be regarded as a suitable candidate for
exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS). Future work
will include the expansion to even more toxicologically relevant chemicals and testing the capacity of the developed
sample preparation workflow in large cohort studies to investigate the impact on instrumental robustness and downtimes.
