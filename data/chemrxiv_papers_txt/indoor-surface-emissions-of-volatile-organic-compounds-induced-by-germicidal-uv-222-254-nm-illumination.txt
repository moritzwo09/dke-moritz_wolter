increased surface emissions during GUV illumination. In addition to compounds intrinsic to
the illuminated surface, GUV light also increased surface off-gassing of externally applied
compounds including limonene and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA). The magnitude of the enhanced
surface emissions was found to decrease with increasing GUV pathlength resembling the
expected decrease of the irradiance. Overall, greater surface emissions were induced by the

SYNOPSIS
The mechanisms driving changes in volatile organic compound (VOC) levels during germicidal
ultraviolet radiation indoor remain underexplored. This study uncovers GUV-induced surface
emissions as a source of indoor VOCs.

1 INTRODUCTION
Although light in the UV-C range (200-280 nm) has been known to constitute an effective way
of inactivating pathogens for multiple decades [1, 2], interest in germicidal ultraviolet (GUV)
lamps as a means to minimize disease transmission in indoor environments has increased after
the recent COVID-19 pandemic [3]. In addition to the traditional filtered mercury lamps with
a peak wavelength of 254 nm (hereafter referred to as GUV254), filtered krypton-chloride
excimer (KrCl) lamps with a peak wavelength of 222 nm (referred to as GUV222) have also
gained ground. However, although both GUV222 and GUV254 have proven effective in terms
of inactivating pathogens [3-8], the possible implications of bringing non-tropospheric (>15
km) radiation into our indoor environments still remain underexplored.
In the outdoor atmosphere, solar radiation in the UV-C range photolyzes the
constituents of the air (i.e. break their molecular bonds), thereby initiating formation of oxidants
such as ozone (O3, 𝜆 < 242 nm [9]) and hydroxyl radicals (∙OH, e.g., through subsequent
photolysis of O3), along with a myriad of chemical reactions. Several studies have shown that

when utilized in indoor environments, GUV222 lamps form O3 [10-14] and ∙OH [12]. In
addition, both GUV222 and GUV254 lamps have been observed to cause increases in particle
number concentrations [12-17] and in the levels of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
[12-16]. While GUV-induced breakdown of larger VOCs has been shown to increase levels of
VOCs such as acetic acid and propionic acid in the gas-phase [18], recent studies have
hypothesized that elevated VOC levels in indoor air following GUV operation could also be
caused by VOC emissions from indoor surfaces promoted by the high-energy light from the
GUV222 and GUV254 lamps [13, 15].
In this paper, we study how GUV222 and GUV254 radiation enhance emissions
of VOCs from distinct indoor surfaces containing different chemical constituents inherent to
the illuminated materials and externally applied to the surface prior to illumination. In addition,
we report on surface VOC emissions in relation to the UV pathlength and irradiance and address
the potential impacts on indoor air composition from location of the GUV lamps.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental design and measurements. In this study, a filtered GUV222 lamp (Care222 w.
B1 module, Ushio Inc.) and a GUV254 lamp (TUV PL-L 18W/4P 1CT/25, Philips) were used
to illuminate various surfaces (~1.44 m2, 1.2 × 1.2 m) mounted on the wall in an unfurnished
room (∼65 m3, 6 × 4 × 2.7 m). In each experiment, the lamp was placed 1 meter from the
surface it was facing with its center 1.32 meter above the floor corresponding to the center of
the surface. A sketch of the set-up can be seen in Figure S1a. The incident irradiance at the
center of the surface was 12.3 𝜇W cm-2 during GUV222 illumination (see Figure S1b) and
~155 𝜇W cm-2 during GUV254 illumination (see Supporting Information for elaboration).
In total, six different surface materials were exposed to the UV light: Teflon (white nontransparent, 1 mm PTFE sheet); a painted plaster wall (room wall, painted 3 years prior);

plywood (Radiata pine); painted plywood (Radiata pine painted with Flutex-Pro 10 acrylic paint
from Flügger six weeks prior); Teflon coated with limonene (~55 mg/m2 corresponding to 2
wt% in 5 mL EtOH), a VOC found in cleaning agents [19, 20]; and Teflon coated with 4oxopentanal (4-OPA, ~35 mg/m2), a common constituent in occupied indoor environments
from reaction of ozone with skin lipids [21, 22]. See Supplementary Information for elaboration
on the preparation of the surfaces. Lastly, correlation between the GUV222 light pathlength
and VOC surface emissions was assessed from experiments in which the lamp was placed at
varying distances from the room wall (1-5 meters in steps of 1 m). An overview of the
experiments can be seen in Table S1.
Measurements of VOCs were performed by proton-transfer-reaction time of flight
mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS 4000, IONICON Analytik GmbH, Austria) [23]. The PTRTOF-MS drift tube was operated with a temperature of 60°C, a pressure of ~3.20 mbar and
voltage of 900 V, giving an E/N ratio of ~135 Td. For all experiments, mass-to-charge ratios
(m/z) from 15 to 250 were measured with an inlet flow of 100 sccm and a time resolution of 20
seconds. Teflon tubing from the PTR-TOF-MS was connected to a switching valve (VICI),
which for a subset of the experiments allowed alternating sampling 1 and 61 cm from the
surface respectively. The data was subsequently analyzed with PTRwid [24] to quantify and
assign chemical formulas. Tentative compound assignments of all chemical formulas presented
throughout the paper can be seen in Table S2. PTR-TOF-MS transmission was obtained using
a liquid calibration unit (LCU, Ionicon) generating known gas-phase concentrations of
methanol, acetone, butanone, p-cresol, indole and phenyl-cyclohexanone. For conversion to
mixing ratios, a rate constant of 2·10-9 cm3 s-1 was used yielding mixing ratios typically accurate
to ±50%. Formaldehyde concentrations from PTR-TOF-MS measurements were calibrated
against high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a 4-point calibration curve ranging
from ~10-560 ppb. Indoor O3 levels were continuously monitored with an O3 monitor (model

202, 2B Technologies), while temperatures and relative humidities were measured using sensor
nodes (AirNodes, AirLabs). Average temperatures and relative humidities in the room were 21
± 1 ℃ and 32 ± 3 % respectively. Surface temperatures, measured with an InfraRed
Thermometer (Art. 15-254, Biltema), were comparable to room temperatures prior to
illumination. Post-illumination measurements conducted for a subset of experiments showed
no temperature increase as a result of GUV illumination. Except for the PTR-TOF-MS Teflon
tubing, no tubing or instrumentation was exposed to the GUV light.

Enhancement Factors. Near-surface (1 cm) concentration enhancement factors (EF) were
calculated using the median concentrations (C) measured for each GUV on/off period (see
Table S3 and S4). To account for non-related changes in the room concentrations (e.g. steady
decreases due to natural loss or steady increases from room emissions) an average of the
concentrations measured prior (30 min) and post (30 min) GUV illumination was used:

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Surface Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from GUV Radiation. Figure 1a shows
the levels of selected VOCs measured 1 cm away from the room wall (painted plaster wall) and
a Teflon surface respectively during three consecutive periods with on/off illumination with
GUV lamps positioned 1 m from the surface. Illumination of the wall with 222 nm light showed
instantaneous increases in the levels of numerous mass-to-charge ratios including, but not
limited to, m/z 31, 33, 45, 57, 59 and 61, assigned as CH2OH+, CH4OH+, C2H4OH+, C4H8H+,
C3H6OH+ and C2H4O2H+ respectively. It is suggested that these compounds represent the
protonated ions of formaldehyde, methanol, acetaldehyde, an alcohol fragment [25], acetone
and acetic acid respectively. The levels remained elevated during illumination but were

followed by immediate decreases as the lamp was turned off. While gas-phase production
would typically lead to continuous changes in the VOC room levels, the abrupt changes
observed suggest that a GUV222-triggered on/off mechanism at the surface, e.g. surface offgassing, is the dominant cause of the altered VOC levels. This is supported by alternating
measurements sampled 1 and 61 cm away from the wall respectively, which show little or no
changes in VOC levels at the 61 cm distance (see Figure S2). Similar trends were also observed
during illumination with the GUV254 lamp. However, despite the more than tenfold greater
irradiance induced by the GUV254 lamp compared to the GUV222 lamp (~155 vs. 12.3 𝜇W
cm-2 at the center), the effects of GUV254 illumination of the wall were much less pronounced.
When the wall was covered by Teflon, the increase in VOC levels upon
illumination was greatly diminished resulting in close to stable measurements across the
majority of compounds presented independent on GUV operation. For C2H4OH+ and C3H6OH+
however, gradual increases were observed during GUV illumination of the Teflon surface
followed by stabilization during GUV off-periods. This is hypothesized to arise from either
potential light spill onto the surrounding wall, reflection of UV light by the reflective Teflon
surface [26] onto adjacent walls not covered by the Teflon sheet or contributions from gas phase
reactions (i.e. OH or O3 oxidation chemistry) initiated by the GUV lamps [12, 14, 16, 27].
While O₃ production was evident with GUV222, O₃ levels remained at ~0 ppb during GUV254
operation (see Figure S6), leaving OH oxidation as the only plausible oxidation pathway during
GUV254 illumination. Overall however, PTR-TOF-MS measurements did not reveal any
consistent decreases in compound levels that would suggest a pronounced depletion of larger
VOCs from either gas-phase photolysis or oxidation during GUV illumination.

concentration increases are normalized to the last measurement before the first GUV on-period. b) Near-surface (1 cm)

center) and 254 nm light (blue, 155 𝜇W cm-2 at the surface center). Tentatively assigned compound names are given in
parenthesis below the compound formula. MVK and MACR refers to methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein respectively. Please
note that the x-axis has logarithmic spacing.

In addition to the wavelength of the applied GUV light (254 vs 222 nm), the
surface illuminated was also found to play a key role in terms of potential off-gassing. Figure
1b shows the Enhancement Factors (EFs) across 11 compounds and for the sum of VOCs during
illumination of the Teflon sheet, the room wall (painted plaster wall), plywood and painted
plywood. EFs from painted plywood were found to be significantly greater than for unpainted
plywood during GUV222 illumination. Time resolved data from illumination of plywood and
painted plywood across selected compounds can be seen in Figure S3. In fact, EFs from the
painted plywood strongly resembled those from the painted plaster wall suggesting that during
GUV222 illumination of the wall, the majority of the off-gassed compounds originate from the
paint coating. In support of this, PTR-TOF-MS headspace analysis of the wet paint confirmed
the presence of all VOCs presented in Figure 1 (see Figure S4). Across the four surfaces

presented in Figure 1b, GUV222-induced surface off-gassing from the wall and painted
plywood was unequivocally the most significant. The largest EFs observed overall was related
to C2H4O2H+ (acetic acid) off-gassing during GUV222 illumination of the painted plywood and
the wall and was found to be 3.3 ± 0.5 and 3 ± 0.3 respectively. This is in line with a previous
study showing increases in acetic acid concentrations in office air during GUV222 operation
[13]. In general, surface off-gassing was found to be more pronounced during GUV222
illumination compared to GUV254. While the EFs of the sum of VOCs were 1.34 ± 0.03 and
1.33 ± 0.04 when the GUV222 lamp was used to illuminate the wall and the painted plywood
respectively, this was 1.043 ± 0.003 and 1.030 ± 0.007 for the GUV254 lamp. Considering the
more than tenfold lower irradiance induced by the GUV222 lamp compared to the GUV254
lamp, these results suggest that the surface off-gassing is wavelength-dependent, likely due to
the absorption cross-sections of the irradiated surface molecules. Several studies report on UVinduced degradation of larger organic compounds and polymers resulting in formation and
emissions of VOCs following exposure to UV-light [18, 28]. Photo-induced degradation of the
illuminated surface materials, e.g. breakdown of paint polymers [29], could thus potentially
explain the observed emissions.
Alternatively or in addition, the observed emissions could also be induced by
photodesorption [30] or an internal energy increase in surface molecules following UV
absorbance increasing the vibrational energy of the molecules allowing them to evaporate from
the surface as hypothesized in previous studies [13, 15]. In relation, GUV application was found
to promote off-gassing of chemicals externally applied to the surface prior to illumination.
Figure 2 shows the limonene (sum of C10H16H+ and C6H8H+) and 4-OPA (C5H8O2H+) levels
during GUV222 and GUV254 illumination of Teflon sheets with and without coatings of
limonene and 4-OPA solutions respectively. As expected, the limonene and 4-OPA levels
remained stable during on/off illumination of the uncoated Teflon sheets. Only a small increase

in 4-OPA was observed during GUV222 illumination, likely due to the oxidation of naturally
occurring squalene in the room by O3 produced from the GUV222 lamp (see Figure S6). In
contrast, experiments with coated Teflon sheets showed an overall decline in near-surface
concentrations caused by the continuous depletion of limonene and 4-OPA on the surfaces.
However, upon illumination, the GUV222 lamp caused instantaneous increases in the limonene
levels from the limonene-coated Teflon sheet, confirming GUV222-induced evaporation of
surface molecules. This effect was less pronounced for GUV254 in line with expected lower
UV-absorption by limonene at this higher wavelength [31]. For the 4-OPA-coated surface,
increased off-gassing of 4-OPA was observed from illumination by both GUV222 and
GUV254. Comparison of the off-gassing magnitudes induced by the GUV lamps should be
done with caution as these are expected to be highly sensitive to the amount of coating left on
the Teflon sheets.
The findings presented in Figure 2 demonstrate that GUV induced surface offgassing is not limited to compounds intrinsic to the illuminated surface but also apply to those
externally applied e.g. during cleaning or formed from e.g. ozone-initiated reactions of skin
lipids on indoor surfaces. In extension hereof, increases in the levels of compounds known to
originate from oxidation of the applied compounds were also observed during both GUV222
and GUV254 illumination, including C9H14OH+ (assigned as limona ketone). It remains unclear
whether this compound was formed in the gas phase after off-gassing of limonene or if it was
formed on the surface and subsequently off-gassed during illumination.

surface coated with limonene (solid line) and a Teflon surface coated with 4-OPA (solid line).

Impact of GUV Pathlength & Irradiance on Surface Emissions. Figure 3 shows the
correlation between the GUV222 pathlength and the magnitude of the surface off-gassing of
C2H4O2H+ from the wall. As illustrated by Figure 3a, GUV222-induced enhancements in nearsurface concentrations of C2H4O2H+ are highly dependent on the distance between the GUV
lamp and the wall (i.e. the GUV pathlength) and hence the intensity of the light reaching the
surface. For C2H4O2H+, the surface off-gassing was found to decrease with a power of -1.7 ±
0.1 with pathlength, thereby closely resembling that of irradiance which is expected to decrease
with a power of -2 with GUV222 pathlength (Fig. 3b). This also implies a close to linear
correlation between the enhancement of the surface off-gassing and the incident irradiance at
the wall perpendicular to the GUV222 lamp as can be seen in the inset of Figure 3b showing a
~7 % change in surface off-gassing with each 𝜇W cm-2 of irradiance. Although larger
uncertainties are related to the fits of other compounds observed to off-gas from the room wall,
e.g. CH2OH+, CH4OH+, C2H4OH+, C4H8H+ and C3H6OH+ as presented in Figure S5, decreases
with increasing GUV pathlength were observed in all cases. However, variations between the

potencies with which they decrease (i.e. -0.9 to -1.7) and the deviation from -2 (i.e. the expected
irradiance decrease) suggest the presence of other influencing factors. For example, it is
speculated that the surface reservoirs of the compounds might be a limiting factor in terms of
surface off-gassing, especially at lower GUV pathlengths. Although not tested, GUV254induced surface off-gassing is hypothesized to display a similar pathlength and irradiance
dependency.
It is important to note that the examined GUV pathlengths in the current study
were chosen with no regards to GUV222 exposure threshold limit values (TLV) as reported by
e.g. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Presently, the
ACGIH TLV for 222 nm is 161 mJ/cm² corresponding to an 8-hour exposure to 5.6 𝜇W cm-2
GUV222 irradiance. The 8-hour TLV is thus lower than the maximum irradiance of 12.3 𝜇W
cm-2 obtained at 1 meter GUV222 pathlength in the current study, but equals the maximum
irradiance obtained at a pathlength of ~1.6 m (see Figure 3b) or a ~3.5-hour exposure to 12.3
𝜇W cm-2.

was turned on. b) Correlation between the near-surface C2H4O2H+ increase (ppb) upon GUV222 illumination and the GUV222

4 IMPLICATIONS
Changes in VOC concentrations following application of GUV222 in laboratory chambers and
real indoor environments have in-large been ascribed to GUV222-induced production and
subsequent gas-phase reactions of O3 and OH-radicals with resulting VOC oxidation byproducts [12, 14, 16]. In this work we report that in addition to formation from UV-induced
gas-phase chemistry, several VOC species observed following indoor GUV application can be
attributed to enhanced emissions from abundant indoor surface reservoirs. Along with VOCs
intrinsic to the surface materials, increase in emissions from externally applied compounds are
also reported upon GUV illumination, demonstrating that the observed effects are also of
relevance for species typically applied to indoor surfaces, including limonene from e.g. cleaning
agents [19, 20] and 4-OPA from e.g. reactions of O3 with skin oils on occupant and nonoccupant
surfaces (e.g. dust, and furniture) [21, 22]. Considering the large surface-to-volume ratio of
many indoor environments, the reported UV-induced surface off-gassing should be considered
as a potentially significant contributor to changes in indoor VOCs associated with GUV
application. As the GUV-induced surface emissions are found to be highly correlated with
surface irradiance, this emphasizes the importance of GUV lamp irradiance and positioning
(e.g. distance to illuminated surfaces) when assessing potential indoor air quality impacts from
indoor GUV application. It should be noted that although increasing GUV pathlength will
reduce the GUV-induced surface emissions from the illuminated area, the resulting room
concentrations will likely be counteracted by an accompanying increase in the total area
illuminated. In relation, it is important to note that the enhancements in VOC emissions from
GUV illumination reported in this study is from near-surface measurements, thus any resulting
increase in room air concentration will depend on factors beyond surface materials, GUV
irradiance, pathlength, and irradiated surface area. These include room size (i.e. surface-to-

volume ratio) and ventilation which could significantly limit any indoor air quality impacts
associated with the observed GUV-induced surface emissions. Also, the impact of the reported
UV-induced emissions on indoor VOCs and air quality is expected to vary significantly
considering the large diversity in indoor surfaces and residing chemical reservoirs. In this work,
we report on the VOC emissions from a small subset of indoor surface materials and coatings
thus calling for further studies of GUV-induced emissions encompassing diverse indoor
settings and surfaces as well as a wider range of chemical species including semi-volatile
organic compounds (SVOCs).
