ABSTRACT:

8

Though organic contaminants and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are very different contaminants, both are

9

ubiquitous in urban runoff, mobile in conventional biofilters, and interact with biochar via hydrophobic

10

interactions. However, limited information is available regarding their simultaneous retention in biochar-

11

amended filtration systems, which was evaluated here via intermittently dosed column tests. Columns

12

amended with commercial biochar (ABC-biochar or WF-biochar) were compared to sand-only controls

13

over treatment of 100 empty bed volumes (EBVs) of creek water, which was augmented with dissolved

14

organic carbon (DOC) and organic contaminants, as well as E. coli during three loading periods. While

15

both biochars demonstrated similar DOC removal, effluents from ABC-biochar columns showed reduced

16

specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA) and improved organic contaminant retention relative to sand-only

17

and WF-biochar columns. However, biochar-amended filters showed limited improvement in E. coli

18

retention, as sand-only and biochar-amended columns demonstrated up to 1.0 ± 0.5 and 1.4 ± 0.4 log-

19

removal of E. coli, respectively. E. coli log-removal for all columns was reduced to 0.5 ± 0.1 following a

20

freeze-thaw cycle. Drainage rates for ABC-biochar columns were on average approximately 50% higher

21

than the other columns, demonstrating the importance of considering hydraulic conditions when assessing

22

overall filtration performance. Our findings warrant more rigorous validation of the effects of biochar

23

amendment to filtration performance under environmentally relevant conditions and at the field scale.

INTRODUCTION:

25

Contamination of receiving waters by urban runoff, driven by increasing impervious cover and release of

26

anthropogenic contaminants in urban areas, has caused growing environmental and public health concern

27

(1). Conventional stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are often designed primarily to prevent

28

flooding, while reductions in contaminant loads are secondary treatment goals (2). More recently, low

29

impact development approaches such as biofiltration have emerged that seek to simultaneously manage

30

water quantity and quality by filtering contaminants through bioretention media to retain contaminants.

31

While such systems have proven effective for removal of hydrophobic and sediment-bound contaminants

32

such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and some metals, they are less effective for removal of various other

33

more “mobile” contaminants present in urban runoff (3). For example, Escherichia coli (E. coli) can enter

34

urban drainage systems via animal feces or leaking sewer or septic systems (4), and is poorly removed by

35

conventional biofiltration systems (5). This has brought about substantial public health concern in addition

36

to economic concerns associated with lost recreational opportunities, as exceedances of acute standards for

37

E. coli have led to beach closures across the U.S. (6,7). Additionally, contamination of receiving waters

38

with various dissolved organic contaminants present in urban runoff such as pesticides and chemicals from

39

vehicle fluids has caused increasing concern, as these contaminants are widely present in urban runoff and

40

poorly removed by conventional treatment systems (8,9).

41

Amendment of biofiltration systems with sorbent materials is an emerging approach to improve retention

42

of mobile contaminants such as E. coli and organic contaminants. For example, biochar, a stable

43

carbonaceous substance produced by thermally processing biomass (e.g., pyrolysis or gasification) has

44

received substantial recent attention due to its multifaceted utility for soil health, carbon sequestration, and

45

water quality management (10). Biochar can have widely varying material properties, including high

46

intraparticle surface area and tunable surface chemistry, which are dependent on production conditions

47

including feedstock and production temperature (11,12). While biochar has long been used as a soil

48

conditioner, the application of biochar for water quality management is a growing field of research (13),

49

and biochars that are effective for soil conditioning may not necessarily be effective for water treatment.

50

Biochar has demonstrated promising results for enhanced retention of mobile contaminants such as E. coli

51

and dissolved organic contaminants from urban drainage in laboratory experiments (7,14). However, the

52

observed retention performance for these contaminants varies widely and is strongly dependent on biochar

53

production characteristics and resulting materials properties. For example, previous laboratory studies have

54

found that wood-based biochars produced at high temperatures (e.g., >600 °C) are more effective for

55

retention of both organic contaminants and E. coli (15,16).

56

Though E. coli and organic contaminants are very different in nature, hydrophobic interactions have been

57

shown to contribute to retention processes for both types of contaminants. Accordingly, their enhanced

58

retention has been attributed to increased intraparticle porosity and hydrophobic surface chemistry (e.g.,

59

more aromatic, fewer oxygen-containing functional groups) that arise for biochars produced at higher

60

temperatures (17). Additionally, pi-pi interactions with aromatic biochar surfaces can also contribute to

61

enhanced retention of aromatic organic contaminants by high-temperature biochars (18), while physical

62

straining has been shown to affect retention of E. coli (19). However, while the individual removal

63

mechanisms for these contaminants have been relatively well characterized under controlled laboratory

64

conditions, few studies have evaluated their simultaneous removal, particularly under gravity-driven

65

intermittent flow conditions typical of actual treatment systems. Further, results from a recent field-scale

66

study have suggested that amendment of sand filters with biochar may not necessarily lead to improved

67

retention of E. coli or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), potentially due to differences in operational

68

conditions or biochar characteristics when transitioning from laboratory to field-scale (20).

69

In this study we evaluated the performance of biochar-amended sand filtration columns operating under

70

intermittent flow conditions for the simultaneous retention of organic contaminants and E. coli. To simulate

71

environmentally representative conditions, experiments were performed with urban creek water augmented

72

with DOC, organic contaminants, and E. coli. We hypothesized that effectiveness for retention of the

73

aromatic portions of DOC, as indicated by specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), could be used to probe

74

for the presence of carbonaceous sorption sites that facilitate hydrophobic interactions, and ultimately as an

75

indicator for retention performance for organic contaminants and E. coli. We compared the performance of

76

two commercial, high-temperature, wood-based biochars marketed as soil conditioners against sand-only

77

controls. Our findings demonstrate the challenges of translating results observed in the laboratory to

78

systems operating under more environmentally representative conditions, and warrant more rigorous

79

validation of the effects of biochar amendment to filtration performance at the field scale.

80

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION:

81

Acquisition and characterization of filter materials

82

Filter materials. Two representative commercial biochars were selected to evaluate potential variations in

83

material properties and performance among high-temperature, wood-based biochars available in bulk

84

quantities. Biochars were obtained from the American Biochar Company (ABC-biochar, Niles, Michigan,

85

marketed as Naked Char) and Wakefield Biochar (WF-biochar, Valdosta, Georgia). Both biochars are

86

marketed primarily as soil conditioners and are available in bulk at comparable prices. While the ABC-

87

biochar had a moderately higher cost (approximately $250/CY versus $190/CY for WF-biochar, as of

88

November 2024), the company provides more publicly available documentation for technical specifications

89

(Figure S1) on their website (21) relative to the Wakefield Biochar website (22). The ABC-biochar is a

90

steam-activated biochar produced from Southern Yellow Pine with pyrolysis temperatures ranging from

91

550–900 °C (particle sizes ranging from 0.5–2.0 mm). This biochar was selected because it was previously

92

evaluated in laboratory up-flow saturated column experiments (16) and demonstrated effective E. coli

93

retention (i.e., up to 3 log-removal). The WF-biochar is also a high-temperature, wood-based biochar, and

94

is produced from loblolly pine waste wood from sawmill operations at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C

95

or higher (particle size ranging from 0.3–2.4 mm). As a base for the biochar-amended filtration media,

96

concrete sand was purchased from Plaisted Companies (Elk River, Minnesota, technical data for particle

97

size and mineral composition provided by Plaisted are shown in Tables S1 and S2). Gravel used for drainage

98

and media support purposes (particle size ranging from 2.38–4.76 mm) was thoroughly washed with

99

deionized water prior to use.

100

Biochar characterization. Ultimate and Proximate analyses were carried out by Timber Products Inspection

101

(Conyers, GA) following ISO standard methods (Table S3). Biochar pH was measured following

102

equilibration with deionized water using a Fisher Brand Accumet AB150 pH electrode (23). To quantify

103

intraparticle porosities, dual N2/CO2 gas adsorption experiments were performed with a Micromeritics 3

104

Flex according to a previously published method (24), and cumulative pore volumes were determined for

105

the microporous (0.36-0.99 nm) and mesoporous (2.00–50 nm) ranges. Intraparticle pore volumes are

106

provided as a metric for intraparticle surface area, as previous studies have shown that Brunauer-Emmett-

107

Teller (BET) surface area values for biochars determined via N2 physisorption are biased by degassing

108

temperature (25). The utility of intraparticle pore volume as an indicator for the availability of intraparticle

109

sorption sites is supported by previous work showing that pore volume is a better predictor than BET surface

110

area for the uptake of organic contaminants by biochars in batch tests (15).

111

Experimental approach

112

Experimental apparatus. Columns consisted of 2-inch ID x 24-inch length (5.1 cm x 61 cm) PVC pipe with

113

an open top and bottom cap and a 1 cm outlet, such that the drainage rate was controlled by the filter media

114

and back pressure within the column was minimized. Columns were packed (from bottom to top) with a

115

gravel drainage layer, a filtration layer including sand or sand amended with one of the two biochars, and

116

an upper gravel layer to fix the media in place and facilitate flow distribution. Following compaction during

117

initial dosing events, each column contained approximately 8–10 cm of ponding space above the filter beds.

118

Three different column configurations were evaluated in triplicate: sand-only control columns, sand

119

amended with the ABC-biochar, and sand amended with the WF-biochar. Sand and biochar were mixed at

120

a 70:30 volume ratio prior to being dry-packed into columns, such that the filtration layers had an empty

121

bed volume (EBV) of approximately 700 mL. The bulk density of the sand and sand/biochar mixtures were

122

1.6 g/cm3 and 1.21 g/cm3, respectively. All columns had similar porosities following initial equilibration

123

via flushing with deionized water (40% ± 2% v/v).

124

Preparation of dosing solution. Natural creek water (20 L) was collected from Tischer (Duluth, MN) 24–

125

72 hours prior to each test. To augment DOC levels, creek water was equilibrated overnight with 5 g of

126

dried leaf litter prior to each dosing event. Following equilibration, equal volumes of creek water (2.1 L,

127

equivalent to three empty bed volumes, EBVs) were added to nine separate influent containers, each of

128

which were charged with organic contaminants (four analytes: atrazine, diuron, imidacloprid, and methyl

129

benzotriazole, selected due to their high detection frequency in urban runoff (8)) via a methanol carrier

130

solution to achieve influent concentrations between 10–20 µg/L. Organic contaminant concentrations were

131

approximately an order of magnitude above typical environmental concentrations to facilitate observation

132

of breakthrough within the experimental duration, reflecting procedures from various previous studies

133

(14,15,26,27).

134

To augment influent E. coli levels for a subset of dosing tests (i.e., E. coli loading periods), a concentrated

135

E. coli culture was initially prepared from stock E. coli (reference strain ATCC#25922) in sterilized LB

136

media and stored in an incubator at 35 °C for at least 24 hours prior to use. Fresh E. coli subcultures were

137

prepared one to two days prior to dosing tests by diluting E. coli cultures 100x in 1x phosphate-buffered

138

saline (PBS). Immediately prior to dosing tests, 5 mL of dilute subculture were added to each influent

139

reservoir to achieve target E. coli concentrations of roughly 200,000 colony forming units (CFU) per 100

140

mL, though actual measured concentrations varied from 100,000–500,000 CFU/100 mL. While these

141

concentrations are approximately an order of magnitude higher than maximum reported environmental

142

levels (3), these high concentrations were presumed necessary to enable differentiation between treatment

143

conditions with large differences in removal performance. Note that Valenca et al. reported E. coli retention

144

up to 3 log-removal for ABC-biochar in saturated up-flow column tests (16). Therefore, an influent

145

concentration of 200,000 CFU/100mL would enable quantification differentiation between conditions

146

achieving between 1 and 3 log-removal (effluent concentrations between 200–20,000 CFU/100mL) using

147

the E. coli plating described a subsequent section.

148

Dosing procedure. A total of 34 dosing tests (3 EBV each, 102 EBV total) were performed twice per week

149

over a six-month period, representative of 2.5 years of equivalent runoff volume based on an approximate

150

average annual rainfall of 30 inches (76 cm) for the Duluth, MN area. The first dosing period consisted of

151

18 dosing tests performed during the fall (0–54 EBVs). The columns were then subject to a freeze-thaw

152

cycle, during which the column manifold was stored outside under a tarp for 6 weeks (average temperature

153

of -6.1 °C, ranging from -22 to +6.9 °C), then allowed to thaw at room temperature and subject to an

154

additional 18 dosing tests (dosing period 2, 57–102 EBVs). Columns were allowed to drain but remained

155

moist prior to the freeze-thaw cycle. Note that an unseasonably warm winter in Duluth, MN enabled

156

collection of creek water for the entire duration of the experiment, though the water was at near-freezing

157

temperatures upon collection during winter months and did not fully equilibrate to room temperature

158

overnight during the second dosing period.

159

E. coli loading periods were performed at the beginning of the experiment (loading period 1, five dosing

160

tests, 0–15 EBVs), at the end of the first dosing period prior to the freeze-thaw cycle (loading period 2, five

161

dosing tests, 42–54 EBVs), and near the end of the experiment (81 EBVs), though E. coli concentrations

162

were only augmented in the influent during a single dosing test for the final loading period. During each

163

dosing test 3 EBVs (2.1L) of water (equivalent to a two-inch storm for a treatment system sized to 5% of

164

the catchment area) were delivered from each influent reservoir to the ponding reservoir for each column,

165

and the water was allowed to drain by gravity through each column. Samples were collected from effluent

166

reservoirs once the reservoir volume reached approximately 1 L. Samples for CECs were collected in 20

167

mL glass scintillation vials and stored frozen until analysis. UV 254 analyses were performed for each

168

doing test, and samples were collected in 50 mL falcon tubes and analyzed on the same day. Aliquots for

169

E. coli analyses were also taken from the 50 mL Falcon tubes and E. coli analyses were initiated on the day

170

of the experiment. Samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis were collected in 250 mL poly

171

bottles and stored frozen.

172

Hydraulic conductivity measurements. Hydraulic conductivity tests were performed on six occasions

173

throughout the dosing experiment as described previously (28). Briefly, while maintaining a constant height

174

of water over the filter media, the discharge volume from each column was measured over 60-second

175

increments. The average hydraulic conductivity for each column was calculated from the average of six

176

individual measurements according to Darcy’s law.

177

Quantitative analysis

178

E. coli analysis. E. coli concentrations were determined by a plating method using Coliscan® Easygel®

179

kits (Micrology Laboratories, Granger, Indiana) according to manufacturer-recommended procedures.

180

Briefly, Easygel media containing 1–5 mL aliquots of sample were incubated at 35 °C in sterile petri dishes

181

for 24 hours. Highly concentrated samples (e.g., influent samples during E. coli loading periods) were pre-

182

diluted 10x with PBS buffer. Following incubation, plates were documented photographically, and colonies

183

were counted based on the images using OpenCFU, an open-source colony counting software (see Figure

184

S2 for example images and details regarding counting procedures). While higher variability is expected for

185

these measurements relative to more robust quantitative approaches (i.e., Colilert tests), this method was

186

selected to enable identification of large differences in E. coli retention performance (i.e., orders of

187

magnitude differences in concentration) among experimental conditions over numerous treatment events

188

while accommodating budget constraints. Note that effluent concentrations below 200 CFU/100 mL (i.e.,

189

<10 CFU for an undiluted 5 mL sample) or above 300,000 CFU/100 mL (i.e., >300 CFU for a 10x diluted

190

1 mL sample) can be considered semi-quantitative estimates due to inconsistencies in colony counting and

191

plating at very high and low concentrations, respectively. However, effluent E. coli concentrations during

192

E. coli loading periods largely fell within the quantitative range (e.g., between 1000 and 100,000 CFU/100

193

mL).

194

Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA). Filtered (0.45 µm, nylon) influent and effluent samples were

195

analyzed by ultraviolet visible absorbance spectroscopy at 254 nm (UVA 254) using a Perking Elmer

196

Lambda 25 Spectrophotometer. DOC (mg/L) was also measured for select samples to determine the

197

specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA, UVA 254/DOC, L/mg*m). DOC analysis was performed using a

198

Shimadzu TOC-L Total Carbon Analyzer and a high temperature combustion method (SM 5310-B 2014).

199

Organic contaminant analysis. A detailed description of the sample preparation, instrumental analysis, and

200

quality assurance/ quality control procedures for analysis of organic contaminants is provided in the

201

Supporting Information (Table S4). Briefly, samples were diluted with isotope-labeled extraction

202

surrogates and analyzed by a multiple-reaction-monitoring high resolution (MRMHR) acquisition method

203

using an AB Sciex X500R quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF-MS) coupled to an AB

204

Sciex ExionLC AD liquid chromatography system. Two transitions (one quantitative, one qualitative) were

205

monitored for five analytes (atrazine, imidacloprid, methyl-1H-benzotriazole, diuron, and 1-(3,4-

206

dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea; DCPMU). Select samples were analyzed as necessary to identify any

207

contaminant breakthrough that occurred within the experimental duration. Influent samples were analyzed

208

in triplicate from three randomly selected influent containers. Effluent samples from sand-only controls

209

were analyzed in triplicate (i.e., individual samples from each of the three replicate columns). Effluent

210

samples for biochar-amended columns were initially measured in duplicate to identify instances of

211

breakthrough, and were analyzed in triplicate if any of the five analytes were detected for a given dosing

212

test. Reporting limits ranged from 0.025–0.1 ng/mL depending on the analyte (Table S4). No analytes were

213

detected above the reporting limits in the laboratory blanks, which were performed during each preparatory

214

batch.

215

Statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons were performed via two-tailed, paired student t tests, where a

216

threshold of p < 0.05 was used to identify statistically significant differences between data sets (assuming

217

equal variance unless noted otherwise). Values for n indicate the number of data points for each

218

experimental condition included in statistical calculations (n > 3 indicates inclusion of experimental

219

replicates over multiple dosing tests). Mean values are reported with the standard deviations for three

220

experimental replicates as error, unless indicated otherwise. For example, combined means and standard

221

deviations from more than one column type or from multiple dosing tests are reported for instances where

222

student t tests indicated that the data sets were statistically equivalent.

223

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

224

Biochar characterization

225

The biochar characterization results are shown in Table S3. The ABC-biochar had a relatively high moisture

226

content (14%, as expected for the steam-activated biochar), while its fixed carbon, ash, and volatile matter

227

contents (82%, 11%, 7% on a dry weight basis, respectively) were in line with previously reported values

228

for high-temperature, wood-based biochars (16). In contrast, the WF-biochar had an unusually high ash

229

content (77%, dry) and very low fixed carbon content (15%). Analysis of WF-biochar from a package

230

obtained from a separate order showed similar results. While high ash contents are generally considered

231

undesirable for commercial biochars, the presence of alkaline chemical species could potentially be

232

beneficial for remediating acidic soils (29). Results for pH indicate that the WF-biochar was circumneutral

233

(pH = 7.17), while the ABC biochar was alkaline (pH = 9.67).

234

Technical data provided by Wakefield Biochar suggested that these characterization results were atypical,

235

and thus may have been due to batch-to-batch variations that can arise during biochar production. For

236

example, introducing oxygen or exceeding temperature or residence time specifications can cause partial

237

combustion, leading to high ash contents and low carbon contents. The intraparticle pore volume data

238

further support this reasoning. For example, the intraparticle pore volume for the ABC-biochar (0.44 cm3/g

239

cumulative pore volume) was relatively high (e.g., values ranging from 0.070–0.62 cm3/g were reported for

240

high-temperature wood-based biochars in a previous study (15)). In contrast, the intraparticle pore volume

241

for the WF-biochar (0.072 cm3/g) was very low, potentially because the intraparticle pore structure for the

242

WB-biochar collapsed, as could be expected for a partially combusted, high-ash material. These results

10

243

suggest that the WF-biochar likely contained fewer intraparticle carbonaceous sorption sites available to

244

facilitate hydrophobic interactions relative to the ABC-biochar.

245

Regarding elemental composition, ratios of H/C and O/C are indicative of aromatic and polar surface

246

character, respectively (i.e., lower H/C indicates higher aromaticity, higher O/C indicates higher polarity).

247

The presence of similar H/C (ABC: 0.042, WFB: 0.12) and O/C (ABC: 0.031, WFB: 0.047) ratios suggest

248

that the carbonaceous portions of the materials may have had somewhat similar surface chemistries, though

249

the ABC-biochar appeared to be slightly more hydrophobic (i.e., more aromatic, less polar). Therefore,

250

though the WF-biochar likely contained few intraparticle carbonaceous sorption sites, the chemistry of

251

available surface sites and hence their ability to facilitate hydrophobic interactions may have been similar

252

between the two biochars. Considering that the two biochars have similar particle size ranges and hence

253

similar external surface area, these results suggest that the ABC-biochar possessed properties that could be

254

advantageous over the WF-biochar for sorption of small hydrophobic contaminants that can access

255

intraparticle pore spaces (e.g., organic contaminants), but that the WF-biochar may still have capacity to

256

facilitate hydrophobic interactions with larger species that interact primarily with external particle surfaces

257

(e.g., E. coli), at least on a carbon-normalized basis.

258

DOC concentration and quality

259

Results for UVA 254, DOC, and SUVA analyses are shown in Figure 1. The influent UVA 254 values

260

(Figure 1A) were higher during the first dosing period (conducted during the fall) than the second dosing

261

period (conducted during the winter following a freeze-thaw cycle). The influent DOC concentration

262

appeared to be relatively consistent throughout the experiment (65 ± 3 mg/L, n = 3), with DOC from leaf

263

litter accounting for the majority of the overall DOC (creek water DOC was 13 ± 1 mg/L over three separate

264

dosing tests). The cause for this apparent seasonal difference in the resulting influent DOC quality is

unclear, though cooler water temperatures during the second dosing period may have affected how the DOC

266

leached from the leaf litter. Figure 1B shows that effluent DOC concentrations were relatively consistent

267

throughout the experiment. Effluent DOC concentrations for the sand-only columns (55 ± 4 mg/L, n = 21)

268

were 14% higher on average than those for the biochar-amended columns (ABC-biochar 47 ± 2 mg/L, WF-

269

biochar 48 ± 4 mg/L, n = 21), which showed equivalent effluent DOC concentrations throughout the

Figure 1. Results for influent and effluent UVA 254 from column dosing tests (A.); and DOC (B.) and
SUVA (C.) results for column effluents from select dosing tests. Note that influent DOC concentrations
were only measured during three dosing tests but appeared to be relatively consistent throughout the
experiment (65 ± 3 mg/L). Dosing tests up to 54 EBVs were conducted in the fall, and tests for EBVs
57 and above were conducted in the winter following a freeze-thaw cycle.
270

experiment. This suggests that both biochars consistently retained the same proportion of DOC, or that any

271

differences in DOC retention were balanced by leaching of DOC present on the biochars. However, there

272

were clear differences in the effluent SUVA values between the biochar-amended columns (Figure 1C), as

273

the ABC-biochar columns had much lower UVA 254 values than the WF-biochar columns.

274

These results suggest that though both biochars appeared to retain less than 20% of the total DOC, the

275

ABC-biochar more effectively retained the aromatic portion of the DOC. This interpretation is consistent

276

with the characterization results, as the ABC-biochar appeared to possess more intraparticle carbonaceous

277

sorption sites in the micro- (< 2 nm) and mesoporous (2–50 nm) ranges that may be accessible to aromatic

278

fulvic (0.2–1 nm) and humic (1–50 nm) acid components of the DOC (30). Overall, these findings

279

demonstrate that differences in biochar properties may result in substantial differences in retention of

280

aromatic DOC components, reflecting the potential utility of SUVA to probe for biochar properties that

281

may enhance retention of hydrophobic contaminants.

282

Retention of organic contaminants

283

Data for all detectable influent and effluent concentrations for the five monitored organic contaminants are

284

compiled in a box-and-whisker plot in Figure 2, and Figure S4 shows the organic contaminant

285

concentrations versus EBV. In general, little-to-no retention of organic contaminants was observed for the

286

sand-only columns, with a few exceptions. For example, for two dosing tests near the end of the experiment

287

(treated EBVs = 90, 102) concentrations of methyl-benzotriazole in the sand-only effluents (4 ± 1 ng/mL,

288

n = 6) were significantly lower than the influents (14 ± 2 ng/mL, n = 6, p = 1.8x10-5, Figure S4A). This

289

may have been due to either biodegradation (31) or sorption to biofilms that developed on the sand over

290

time. Further, though DCPMU was not added to nor detected in the influent, it was detected in 54% of the

291

sand-only effluent samples, with concentrations ranging up to 2.1 ± 0.6 ng/mL (Figure S4B). The highest

292

concentrations were observed during the final dosing test from the first dosing period (i.e., at 54 treated

293

EBVs), where diuron concentrations in the sand-only effluents (18 ± 1 ng/mL) were on average 26% lower

294

than influent concentrations (25 ± 1 ng/mL). These results suggest that diuron biodegraded to form DCPMU

295

within the sand-only columns, reflecting previous literature documenting aerobic biodegradation of diuron

296

and accumulation of DCPMU in aerobic soils (32,33). Generation and release of DCPMU from biofiltration

13

297

systems is a potential concern, as diuron is widely present in urban runoff (8), and DCPMU is suspected to

298

be more mobile in the environment and more toxic to aquatic organisms relative to diuron (34).

299

Columns amended with both the WF-biochar and ABC-biochar demonstrated effective retention of organic

300

contaminants throughout the first dosing period, during which no organic contaminants were detected in

301

effluents from the biochar-amended columns. However, initial breakthrough of atrazine was observed for

302

the WF-biochar columns during the dosing test immediately following the freeze-thaw cycle (57 EBVs,

303

Figure 2, inset graphic), and effluent atrazine concentrations reached 0.3 ± 0.1 ng/mL (approximately 3%

304

of the average influent concentration for atrazine) by the final dosing test (102 EBVs). No atrazine

305

breakthrough was observed for the ABC-biochar columns, while no other organic contaminants were

306

detected in the effluents of the biochar-amended columns.

307

These results suggest that disturbances to the WF-biochar columns caused by the freeze-thaw cycle may

308

have facilitated the early breakthrough of atrazine. For example, soil expansion can cause deformation of

309

soil microstructures that may lead to channeling, which is associated with accelerated breakthrough (35).

310

Further, a recent study showed that freeze-thaw cycles can accelerate the disintegration of biochar particles,

311

leading to the release of dissolved and colloidal carbonaceous substances which may carry sorbed

312

contaminants (36). These results further suggest that the retention capacity of the ABC-biochar for organic

313

contaminants was more resilient to the disturbances caused by the freeze-thaw cycle relative to the WF-

314

biochar. This may be attributed to a higher overall retention capacity for the ABC-biochar due to its higher

315

carbon content and intraparticle pore volume, while the ABC-biochar also may have been less fragile than

316

the WF-biochar and more resistant to disintegration. As SUVA results also indicated that the ABC-biochar

317

showed improved retention of aromatic DOC components, these results further support the potential utility

318

of SUVA as a probe for desirable biochar properties.

319

Retention of E. coli

320

Figure 3A shows the E. coli influent and effluent concentrations throughout the dosing experiment, with

321

the grey-shaded areas indicating the three periods where E. coli levels were augmented in the influent (i.e.,

322

E. coli loading periods). Note that during dosing tests between E. coli loading periods, E. coli were present

323

in the creek water during the fall months at concentrations up to approximately 3000 CFU/100 mL, while

324

no E. coli were detected during winter months following the freeze-thaw cycle. Following the loading

325

periods, E. coli concentrations in effluents from the biochar-amended columns appeared to recede

326

somewhat more slowly relative to the sand-only columns, potentially due to release of initially retained E.

327

coli. During the E. coli loading periods, effluent concentrations were lower than influent concentrations for

328

all columns, indicating that all columns demonstrated some degree of E. coli retention.

329

During the first E. coli loading period (considering three of four dosing tests from 3 to 12 EBVs, as plates

330

did not gel properly during the second dosing test) the ABC-biochar and WFB-biochar columns showed

331

similar E. coli retention performance (Figure 3B, p = 0.12 for comparison for log-removal values). Though

332

log-removal values were higher on average for the biochar-amened columns relative to the sand-only

333

columns, the difference was not statistically significant when the biochar-amended columns were

334

considered equivalent (p = 0.06, unequal variance). During the second loading period following

335

conditioning with 40 EBVs, all columns achieved higher log-removal values relative to the first loading

336

period, potentially due to biofilm development (for the sand-only columns) or increased straining due to

337

compaction over time. The ABC-biochar and sand-only columns showed similar retention performance (p
16

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-fht29 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2675-5482 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

338

= 0.19), while log-removal values were higher for the WFB-biochar columns (p = 0.003 and 0.02 for

339

comparison to ABC-biochar and sand-only columns, respectively). While the third E. coli loading period

340

following the freeze-thaw cycle only consisted of a single dosing test, E. coli retention was reduced by up

341

to an order of magnitude relative to the second loading period. This may have been due to disturbances in

342

the filter beds associated with the freeze-thaw cycle, reflecting observations of atrazine breakthrough for

343

the WF-biochar columns.

344

Overall, while E. coli retention performance for all columns appeared to change throughout the dosing

345

experiment, biochar-amended columns showed limited improvement in retention performance relative to

346

sand-only columns. These results are somewhat in contrast to previous studies based on results from

347

laboratory up-flow columns (7,16,19). Interestingly, a previous study also observed diminishing retention

348

of E. coli during intermittent dosing with natural creek water, reporting no discernable improvements for

349

biochar-amended columns by the end of a conditioning period (37). However, when E. coli concentrations

350

were augmented during challenge tests via addition of wastewater, the E. coli retention capacity appeared

351

to be restored. The authors suggested that this may have been due to differences in the behavior of E. coli

352

indigenous to wastewater versus stormwater. While limited information is available regarding E. coli

353

treatment performance for full-scale systems, particularly relative to control conditions without biochar, a

354

recent study also reported little-to-no improvement in retention of E. coli from parking lot runoff in the

355

presence of biochar (20).

356

Overall, these results, in combination with previous studies (20,37), suggest that biochar-enhanced E. coli

357

retention observed in laboratory up-flow saturated columns may not necessarily translate to systems

358

operating under gravity-driven intermittent flow conditions. For example, differences in hydraulic

359

conditions may affect E. coli retention performance, as saturated column tests are often operated under

360

controlled flow rates. While drainage rates for the columns evaluated here generally decreased throughout

361

the experiment, the ABC-biochar columns consistently drained more quickly than the other columns

362

(Figure 3C shows results for hydraulic conductivity measurements conducted before and after the free-thaw

363

cycle). Therefore, as the ABC-biochar columns achieved similar E. coli retention despite lower contacts

364

times, the ABC-biochar appeared to improve the overall filtration function if both hydraulic and E. coli

365

retention performance are taken into account.

366

E. coli retention may have also been affected by differences in water composition, as previous laboratory

367

column studies have largely used laboratory-generated synthetic stormwater (prepared with deionized water

368

salts to mimic typical ion concentrations, with or without added DOC), in contrast to the natural creek water

369

used for this study. The presence of DOC in natural or synthetic waters can enhance the transport of bacteria

370

through saturated porous media and hence reduce bacteria retention (38,39). Moreover, the use of natural

371

water may have facilitated more rapid biofilm development, which also may have affected E. coli retention.

372

For example, biofilms can fill pore spaces and decrease surface area available for interactions with E. coli.

373

One study found that the presence of biochar caused more rapid biofilm growth relative to sand-only

374

columns, but that biofilm development was associated with reduced E. coli retention for biochar-amended

375

columns (40). In contrast, biofilm growth on sand-only columns has been associated with improved E. coli

376

retention (41). These variable effects to E. coli retention have been attributed to differences in surface

377

chemistry and associated impacts to hydrophobic interactions, as the biofilms were less hydrophobic than

378

the biochar surfaces but more hydrophobic than the sand surfaces (40,42). Therefore, the biofilms that

379

developed on the filter media for this study may have reduced the E. coli retention performance for the

380

biochar-amended columns but enhanced performance for the sand columns. This interpretation is further

381

supported by the E. coli concentration data in Figure 3B, as the differences in the E. coli retention from the

382

sand-only columns between the first and second E. coli loading period may have been due in part to biochar

383

development as the experiment progressed.

384

CONCLUSIONS:

385

Regarding retention of organic contaminants, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of

386

carefully considering biochar properties when selecting biochars to be incorporated into stormwater

18

387

treatment systems. Our results suggest that readily measurable properties of effluent DOC such as SUVA

388

and UVA 254 may be useful to identify biochars that may be effective for retention of organic contaminants.

389

For example, while direct measurement of organic contaminants is often cost-prohibitive, simple filtration

390

tests to compare effluent UVA results among candidate materials could be useful as a screening measure

391

during biochar selection. This has practical implications, considering the wide variability of biochar quality

392

among suppliers and on a batch-to-batch basis, and that available technical data may not reflect the full

393

variability of the biochar product.

394

However, we observed limited improvement in E. coli retention that could be attributed to the presence of

395

biochar, suggesting that the benefit of biochar amendment for retention of E. coli may be diminished under

396

more environmentally relevant conditions representative of passive filtration systems (i.e., intermittent,

397

gravity-flow conditions, presence of DOC and biofilms). This prospect has notable practical implications,

398

as municipalities have begun to adapt biochar-amended filtration systems as solutions to E. coli pollution

399

in watersheds, and biochar amendment represents an additional cost to implementation. However, as

400

amendment with the ABC-biochar appeared to improve hydraulic performance and retention of organic

401

contaminants, it is likely that amendment of field-scale filtration systems with biochar still provides

402

substantial treatment benefits, though these benefits may not necessarily be related to the intended function

403

of the filter. Overall, the findings of this study warrant more rigorous verification of the effects of biochar

404

amendment to filtration performance under environmentally relevant conditions, particularly regarding

405

field-scale systems in comparison to control conditions without biochar.
