Abstract

24

Cellulose diacetate (CDA), a bio-based material widely used in consumer products, is

25

biodegradable in the coastal ocean. However, the effect of water temperature on biodegradation

26

rates is unknown, limiting projections of lifetime across space and time. Here, we incubated CDA-

27

based materials (film, foam, and straw), paper straws, polyethylene (PE) films, and polybutylene

28

adipate terephthalate (PBAT) straws for 28 weeks at 10 and 20 °C in continuous-flow seawater

29

mesocosms. The relative mass loss of the CDA film, foam, and straw increased by 20–25% from

30

10 to 20 ºC, and their degradation rates increased by 1.8- to 3.1-fold. Accordingly, model

31

predictions of CDA-based article lifetimes in North American coastal waters were highly sensitive

32

to differences in water temperature across latitude and seasonality. Paper straws also showed a

33

notable temperature dependence, with degradation rates increasing 1.7-fold from 10 to 20 °C. PE

34

films and PBAT straws showed no measurable degradation at either temperature, highlighting their

35

persistence in the environment. Microbial communities implicated in CDA biodegradation were

36

influenced by material type, temperature, and incubation time. Differential analysis revealed that

37

~93% (29/31) of the highly responsive microbial taxa implicated in the degradation of CDA were

38

unique at 10 and 20 °C. These findings indicate that water temperature governs the lifetime of

39

biodegradable materials, supporting its inclusion as a primary variable in experimental frameworks

40

moving forward.

Introduction

49

Plastics in the marine environment are a major concern due to their high volume,

50

environmental persistence, and potential threats to wildlife and humans.1-4 Notably, most plastics

51

are derived from fossil hydrocarbons and have lifetimes of decades to centuries.2, 5-7 A promising

52

solution to limit plastic pollution is to replace fossil carbon-based conventional plastics with

53

sustainably sourced, high-functioning, and low-persistence bioplastics.8-10

54

Cellulose diacetate (CDA) is a bio-based material that has been widely used in consumer goods,

55

including drinking straws,7 textiles,11 and cigarette filters.12, 13 CDA can be biodegraded in natural

56

seawater environments on time scales of months,7, 14, 15 orders of magnitude faster than

57

conventional plastics.5, 7 Detailed degradation mechanisms and potential degrading microbial

58

communities have been identified;14, 15 however, understanding of other environmental factors

59

(e.g., temperature) that may influence the rate and communities implicated in degradation in the

60

coastal ocean remains limited.

61

Seawater temperature varies in time and space. For example, the sea surface temperatures

62

(SSTs) typically range from 10 to 15 °C during winter and from 20 to 30 °C in summer in the mid-

63

latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.16 Under current climate projections, global SSTs are

64

expected to rise by 1–3.5 °C by the end of the 2100.17 These variations in SSTs may affect the

65

biodegradation of CDA because biological processes are sensitive to temperature. The Q10

66

temperature coefficient for surface ocean respiration, which reflects the sensitivity of microbial

67

metabolic rates to a 10 °C increase in temperature, typically ranges from 1.5 to 3.6;18-20 however,

68

the temperature sensitivity of bioplastic degradation under various thermal conditions is severely

69

limited. CDA degradation is an enzymatically driven process in which acetyl groups are cleaved

70

first (i.e., deacetylation) by esterases, then cellulose groups are degraded by cellulases.14 The

71

enzymatic activities of esterases and cellulases are sensitive to temperature, and their optimal

72

activity conditions further depend on the host microorganisms, suggesting that rates of degradation

73

are likely sensitive to temerpature.21, 22 In addition, temperature also affects the composition of the

74

microbial community in seawater, with psychrophiles dominating at ~10 °C and mesophiles

75

dominating at 20-45 °C.23, 24 Changes in the microbial community may, therefore, affect its

76

metabolic potential. Hence, understanding the kinetics and functional microbial communities that

77

underlie CDA biodegradation under different temperature conditions could advance our

78

understanding of the fate of CDA pollution in the coastal ocean.

79

The objectives of this study were to examine how temperature affects the degradation of CDA

80

bioplastics in the coastal ocean, model the lifetime of CDA bioplastics across space and time, and

81

identify specific microorganisms that may drive biodegradation as a function of temperature. To

82

achieve these objectives, we incubated CDA films, foams, and straws in continuous-flow

83

mesocosms with natural seawater alongside materials with high degradability (paper straw),7 and

84

low degradability (polyethylene [PE] film and polybutylene adipate terephthalate [PBAT]

85

straw).14, 25 Degradation experiments were conducted at 10 and 20 °C, bracketing the global

86

average sea surface temperature of 16 °C.16, 26 We assessed the biodegradation of these materials

87

by measuring the mass loss across 28 weeks of incubation, determined the relationship between

88

degradation rates and seawater temperature, and modeled the lifetime of CDA bioplastics in North

89

American coastal waters across latitudinal gradients and seasonality. We also characterized the

90

microbial communities associated with these materials, affording new knowledge of how

91

communities vary with temperature, time, material type, and morphology.

Materials. CDA film (thickness = 113 µm, ρsolid = 1.35 g cm-3), foam (3,750 μm, ρlow = 0.12

95

g cm-3), and straw (175 μm, ρsolid = 1.35 g cm-3) were obtained from Eastman (Kingsport, TN,

96

USA). Paper straw (376 µm) was purchased from Amazon (Harvestraw). PE film (25 μm) was

97

purchased from Unifi Manufacturing Inc. (Greensboro, NC, USA). PBAT straw (269 µm) was

98

bought from Vegware (Boulder, CO, USA). The PBAT straw is composed of 85% PBAT and 15%

99

polylactic acid (PLA) by weight (hereafter referred to as PBAT straw) and it meets compostable

100

standards (ASTM D6400 and EN13432). Among these six materials, only three CDA materials

101

contain approximately 15–20 wt% of a biodegradable plasticizer (i.e., triacetin), which has been

102

shown to leach quickly into seawater.7, 14, 27

103

Incubation of CDA bioplastics and control materials in the seawater mesocosm. CDA and

104

control materials were incubated in continuous flow-through seawater mesocosms with filtered

105

natural seawater.14 The plastic materials with low degradability, PE film and PBAT straw were

106

used as the negative control,14, 28 and the paper straw with a high degradability was selected as the

107

positive control.7 Straw materials, each 25.4 mm in length, and all other materials, cut to

108

25.4 × 25.4 mm (length × width), were incubated in the mesocosm using stainless steel wire

109

holders for the straws and clamps for the films and foams. Detailed information on the mesocosm

110

setup (Figure S1) and seawater has been described previously.14 Seawater with a salinity of ~30

111

ppt29 containing native microbial communities was drawn from Martha’s Vineyard Sound (Woods

112

Hole, MA, USA) and filtered using a 200 μm filter for removing larger particles. Pre-tempered (10

113

and 20 °C) was deposited into head tanks, providing an equal flow rate of approximately 0.7 L

114

hour-1 with a residence time of ~1-h in the mesocosm with a size of 54 × 34 × 25cm (length ×

115

width × height). Degradation experiments were performed at 10 and 20 °C in the absence of

116

sunlight (Figure S1). The temperature was monitored throughout the experiment, averaging 10.4

118

experiment.

119

Sample collection and mass loss measurements. To record photographic evidence of

120

degradation and assess mass loss, samples were collected across 28 weeks of incubation. Briefly,

121

each sample was photographed and then transferred into a pre-weighed 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.

122

Biofilms were removed by incubating each sample for ∼30 min at room temperature and then

123

rinsed with copious amounts of Milli-Q water.14 Subsequently, the samples in their respective

124

tubes were dried at 60 °C for 48 hours in an IsoTemp 637G oven (Fisher Scientific). The samples

125

were removed from the oven and cooled to room temperature before being weighed. Three

126

replicates were collected for each material type at each sampling time point and temperature

127

condition.

128

Mass loss was calculated as the relative mass loss (%) by taking the difference between the

129

initial mass of the sample (m0) and the mass of the sample at a time point (mt), then normalizing it

130

to the initial mass of the sample (Eq 1). Mass loss measurements of CDA materials were

131

reproducible and repeatable over multiple years and seasons.7, 14, 27 Mass loss is a reasonable

132

measure for the degradation of CDA and paper materials because it is well-established that these

133

materials biodegrade to CO2 in the coastal ocean.7, 14 Previous experiments have determined that

134

no mass loss occurred in sterilized controls.15

Eq 2 was applied to a material of initial length l0, width w0, and thickness h0, and then adjusted

143

using a constant β to account for mass loss due to leachable components (e.g., plasticizer) or other

144

initial mass changes between the initial mass and the first time point. This adjustment resulted in

145

Eq 3 for film and foam and Eq 4 for straw. As a result, the trivial data point representing zero mass

l0 and w0 were assumed to be 25.4 mm for each sample, which is valid because Eqs 3 and 4 are

Arrhenius equation is shown in (Eq 6), where Ea is the activation energy of the degradation, R is

162

the gas constant, T is the temperature, and A is the pre-exponential factor. Because the lifetime of

163

CDA bioplastic is dependent on its thickness (h0) and the specific surface degradation rate (kd) (Eq

164

This relationship (Eq 7) makes it possible to predict the persistence of CDA bioplastics in the

broader natural marine environment. Briefly, the lifetimes of CDA bioplastics in coastal oceans

170

were projected by transforming 1° × 1° gridded maps of SSTs generated by CMIP multi-model

171

means by applying Eq 7. We used modeled historical SSTs from 1995–2014 to represent current

172

ocean conditions, with winter SSTs and summer SSTs corresponding to the annual minimum and

173

maximum temperatures, respectively. Models of future winter and summer SSTs from 2081–2100

174

were used to represent the projected annual minimum and maximum temperature conditions,

175

respectively. SST models were available from the IPCC WGI Interactive Atlas (https://interactive-

181

collected for comparison by filtering 1 L of seawater from the mesocosm using 0.2 μm sterilized

biological replicates. Seventy-two biofilm and 12 seawater communities were sequenced for each

185

material type throughout the experiment. All samples were stored at -20 °C before DNA extraction.

186

The entire sample was subjected to DNA extraction using the DNeasy PowerBiofilm kit (Qiagen,

187

Hilden, DE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and concentrations were determined

188

using the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

189

Amplicon libraries for variable region V3-V4 were prepared following previously established

190

procedures.7, 37 The pooled amplicon libraries were sequenced using a 2 × 300 bp MiSeq platform

191

(Illumina) at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland. Amplicon reads

192

were processed using the QIIME2 pipeline38 for quality control, merging sequences, and assigning

193

amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Taxonomy was assigned against the SILVA v138 (silva-138-

194

99-nb-classifier.qza) database.39, 40 No amplification was detected in any of the negative PCR

195

controls, and the one representative PCR negative control that was sequenced had a minimal

196

number of sequences that did not pass the quality filtering and denoising steps. The 16S rRNA

197

gene amplicon sequencing data generated in this study were deposited in the European Nucleotide

203

differences in microbial communities among different materials and incubation times were

204

determined using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) in R with

Briefly, the differential analysis of the relative microbial abundances between CDA and cellulose-

208

based positive material of the same morphology (i.e., straw) was conducted using the DESeq244

209

and the data was visualized using ggplot2.41 It has been demonstrated that CDA degradation is a

210

two-step process comprising the deacetylation and degradation of cellulose groups.14 Accordingly,

211

the differential microbial communities between CDA material and the positive control represent

212

the potential CDA-degrading microbial groups.

214

Results and Discussion

215

CDA degradation under different temperature conditions. Photographic evidence

216

indicated biofouling communities formed on the surface of the CDA and control materials within

217

weeks under the 10 and 20 °C conditions (Figure 1). The extent of biofouling increased over time

218

for all materials. Mass loss measurements demonstrated substantial sensitivity to seawater

219

temperature for those materials that degraded. At 10 °C, the CDA film, foam, and straw lost 35 ±

220

7, 23 ± 1, and 32 ± 2% of their initial mass after 28 weeks of incubation, respectively. In contrast,

221

more than 55 ± 5, 48 ± 6, and 57 ± 2% of their initial mass was lost for CDA film, foam, and straw

222

at 20 °C during the same incubation period. For the three CDA bioplastics, the rapid mass loss in

223

the first 3.5 weeks was due to the release of the biodegradable plasticizer, triacetin, which exhibited

224

similar leaching rates under both temperature conditions. The subsequent mass loss reflects the

225

degradation of the CDA polymer. The mass loss of the paper straw was also sensitive to

226

temperature, with 43 ± 1% mass loss at 10 °C and 71 ± 5% at 20 °C.

227

The significant impact of temperature on CDA biodegradation rates was likely driven by the

228

temperature sensitivity of the enzymes responsible for CDA degradation. Specifically, the

229

activities of esterases and cellulases, two key enzymes that drive CDA degradation, were expected

11

230

to be temperature-sensitive. Research efforts have shown that the optimal temperatures for salt-

231

tolerant esterases and cellulases are typically above 20 °C 45-48. Consistently, degradation of CDA

232

bioplastics was more rapid at 20 °C than at 10 °C.

233

Compared to CDA and paper, the PE film and PBAT straw did not degrade at either

234

temperature (Figure 1). While PE was expected to be persistent,14 evidence to date on the fate of

235

PBAT in the ocean is limited. Although PBAT bioplastics have been reported to degrade in

236

composting systems,49 soils,50 and freshwater environments,51 an increasing number of studies

237

highlight its persistence in the ocean,28, 52-54 including our study (Figure 1). These findings

238

underscore the need to assess degradation in diverse environments prior to universally classifying

239

a polymer as “biodegradable.” Alternatively, studies could prioritize testing of degradation in more

240

challenging environments (e.g., the ocean) and then reasonably assume degradation in more

241

nutrient-rich, productive environments (e.g., freshwater or composting), simplifying the

242

experimental matrix and reducing costs to manufacturers.

Across all CDA and paper materials tested, Q10 values, or the increase in degradation rate with

262

a 10°C increase in temperature, ranged from 1.6 to 3.1. These values fall within the range of Q10

263

values of 1.5 to 3.6 for pelagic microbial rate processes (e.g., respiration and bacterial

264

productivity),18-20 suggesting that CDA and paper materials exhibit temperature sensitivities

265

comparable to those of natural marine microbial processes.

266

The environmental lifetimes for the CDA and control materials were projected using the kd

267

values and the thickness of each material (Table S2). The projected environmental lifetimes of the

268

CDA film (113 µm), foam (3,750 μm), and straw (175 μm) at 10 °C were 1.9 ± 0.1, 4.8 ± 0.1, and

269

3.9 ± 0.2 years, respectively. The projected environmental lifetimes of these three CDA materials

270

at 20 °C were significantly shorter, being 1.0 ± 0.05, 1.6 ± 0.02, and 1.3 ± 0.05 years, respectively.

271

The lifetimes of the paper straw in the coastal ocean at 10 and 20 °C were 1.2 ± 0.03 and 0.7 ±

272

0.02 years, respectively.

Provided the measured kd at 10 and 20 °C and assuming that the biodegradation rates of the

plastics follow the Arrhenius equation,33 modeled predictions of the lifetime of CDA foam were

283

computed across time and space in the North American coastal ocean (Figures 3 and S5). As

284

expected, the lifetime of CDA foam in high-latitude coastal waters is significantly longer than in

285

low-latitude areas, irrespective of seasonality changes (Figure 3). Additionally, the projected

286

lifetime of CDA foam was more sensitive to seasonal SST changes, particularly in middle-latitude

latitude on the east coast is longer in winter (minimum temperature condition) than in summer

(maximum70°N

Under current climate projections, global SSTs are expected to rise by 1–3.5 °C by the end of

305

the 2100.17 Elevated temperatures have been shown to accelerate plastic degradation.33, 55 To assess

306

how the environmental persistence of CDA foam shifts under future warming conditions, we

307

computed CDA foam lifetimes using end-of-century SST conditions (2081-2100, Figure S5). The

308

projected lifetime of CDA foam is shorter in low- and middle-latitude regions under future

309

warming conditions than that of the present. For example, the projected SSTs in Cape Cod Bay at

310

the end of 2100 are about 2 °C higher than present in winter and summer. Accordingly, the

311

projected lifetime of CDA foam in the same area of Cape Cod Bay is approximately 1.6 years

312

under maximum temperature conditions and 5.9 years under minimum temperature conditions

313

(Table S3), both of which are slightly shorter than the lifetimes under present temperature

314

conditions. Collectively, seasonal temperature changes have a far more pronounced effect on the

315

lifetime of a biodegradable material than the future warming of SST.

316
317

Microbial community composition. Principal coordinate analysis showed that the clustering

318

patterns of microbial communities in various materials were mainly determined by material type,

319

incubation time, and temperature (P < 0.01, PERMANOVA) (Figure S6 and Table S5).

320

Specifically, the CDA materials had unique microbial communities based on morphology (i.e.,

321

film, foam, and straw), and the communities shifted significantly with temperature and time

322

(Figures 4 and S6), suggesting that the microorganisms that degrade these materials were selected.

323

In contrast, the communities grown on PE film were separate from those on the CDA materials,

324

positive control, and seawater. Still, they remained relatively stable under different temperatures

325

and incubation times (Figure S6). The communities grown on the PBAT straw were temperature

326

sensitive at week-4, but were similar at week-28 irrespective of temperature conditions.

327

Additionally, the PE film and PBAT straw had similar community structures at week-28 despite

328

the different materials and temperatures. This result suggests that non-degradable materials only

329

provide surfaces for the colonization of microorganisms rather than substrates for metabolism.

330

Communities from the paper straw differed from the other samples (p < 0.01, PERMANOVA).

331

Still, they remained stable across 28 weeks of incubation at 10 and 20 °C (p > 0.05,

332

PERMANOVA), suggesting that the same group of microorganisms was responsible for cellulose

333

degradation. The microbial communities in the seawater remained relatively stable over the 28-

334

week incubation period at both temperatures.

345

and p < 0.001, Figure S8A). Of these 29 genera in CDA films at 10 °C, three genera,

346

Neptuniibacter, Colwellia, and SM1A02, were among the top 20 most abundant genera,

347

collectively accounting for up to 7% of the total relative abundance (Figure S7). In contrast,

348

among these 15 genera in CDA films at 20 °C, the combined relative abundance of the four

349

dominant

350

Sphingorhabdus, was as high as 20% (Figures S7). For CDA foams at week-4, 20 genera were

351

significantly more abundant at 10 °C, whereas 19 genera were more abundant at 20 °C

352

(log2fold change > 5 and p < 0.001, Figure S8B). The most dominant genus, Neptuniibacter,

353

had a relative abundance of up to 4.3% at 10 °C (Figure S7). The three most abundant genera

354

of these 19 genera at 20 °C, Sva0996_marine_group, Winogradskyella, Agaribacterium, had

355

a total relative abundance of 12%. For CDA straws at week-4, 16 genera were more abundant

356

at 10 °C, while 21 genera were more abundant at 20 °C (log2fold change > 5 and p < 0.001,

357

Figure S8C). Of these 16 genera in CDA straws at 10 °C, three genera, Neptuniibacter,

358

Colwellia, and Ulvibacter, were among the top 20 most abundant genera with a total relative

359

abundance of up to 8.8% (Figure S7). Among the 21 genera in CDA straws at 20 °C, the

360

combined relative abundance of the three most dominant genera, Agaribacterium,

361

Pelagicoccus, and Winogradskyella, was as high as 5.3% (Figures S7). Overall, the structure

Potential CDA-degrading microbial communities. The biodegradation of CDA is a two-

backbone.14 The former step, deacetylation, is the rate-limiting step,14, 15, 56 and thus,

367

microorganisms that initiate deacetylation are key drivers of CDA degradation. Accordingly,

368

differential abundance analysis of the community composition between a CDA material and

369

a cellulose-based positive control of the same morphology (i.e., straw) may thus reveal

370

microbial communities that drive the deacetylation of CDA (Figure 5).

371

Differential abundance analysis revealed that 20 highly responsive ASVs were

372

significantly increased in relative abundance in CDA straw compared to paper straw at 10 °C

373

at week-4, with log2fold changes ranging from +7 to +11 and p < 0.001 (Figure 5A). The

374

average relative abundance of these ASVs in CDA straw samples ranged from 0.1 to 2.9%

375

(Figure S9). At 20 °C, 11 ASVs were identified as markedly increased in the relative

376

abundance in CDA straw compared to paper straw (Figure 5B). The average relative

377

abundance of these 11 ASVs in CDA straw samples ranged from 0.6 to 5.2%. Genus-level

378

microbial community composition analysis of these highly responsive ASVs from CDA

379

straws at 10 and 20 °C revealed temperature dependence. Only two ASVs affiliated with the

380

genera g_Candidatus_Kaiserbacteria and g_Eudoraea were identified in CDA straws under

381

both temperature conditions, and the rest of the ASVs were unique (Figures 5 and S9). These

382

findings suggest that temperature selects for unique microbial communities that metabolize

383

CDA.

386

CDA straw and paper straw at 10 °C (A) and 20 °C (B) at week-4. Three biological replicates

derived from the same type of material were pooled together. The communities with an

389

shown in blue and red represent communities in the CDA straw treatment that significantly

The taxonomy of these significantly changed communities was assigned to a genus, or the

lowest level can be assigned.

395
396

Regardless of morphology (e.g., film, foam, and straw), CDA materials were efficiently

397

degraded at both 10 and 20 °C, and biodegradation was driven by different marine communities

398

(e.g., film, foam, and straw) (Figures 4, S7, and S8). These findings suggest that temperature exerts

399

selection on microbial communities, and further support that temperature affects biological

400

processes by determining community composition.23, 24 Most taxa that exhibited a significant

401

increase in relative abundance at 10 °C compared with 20 °C (e.g., Neptuniibacter, Colwellia,

402

SM1A02, and Ulvibacter) have been previously found in cold marine environments.57-60 In

403

contrast, taxa that dominated at 20 °C (e.g., Sva0996_marine_group, Winogradskyella,

404

Agaribacterium, Pelagicoccus, and Sphingorhabdus) were frequently detected in mesophilic

405

marine environments.61-64 These findings emphasize that temperature affects the degradation of

406

CDA bioplastics by selecting distinct microbial communities, highlighting the importance of

407

incorporating temperature into the assessment of marine biodegradation of materials.

408

Comparing the relative importance of temperature to surface area on material

409

degradation rates. While the findings of this study highlight the sensitivity of CDA

410

biodegradation rates to water temperature, this environmental control is relatively less important

411

than surface area, a material property control. The current study demonstrates that the degradation

412

rate of CDA foam increased by 3.1-fold when the temperature rose from 10 to 20 °C (Figures 2

413

and S3). Using the same experimental system and material, we recently reported that when

414

switching from solid CDA to low-density CDA foam, the degradation rate at 20 °C increased by

415

approximately 15-fold (Figure S10).7, 14, 27 Therefore, altering the material properties to increase

416

surface area exerts a disproportionate impact on the persistence of CDA in the coastal ocean

417

compared to water temperature. This result suggests that future material designs aimed at reducing

418

the environmental persistence of biodegradable materials, especially in colder waters, should

419

prioritize the development of material-efficient articles with increased surface area.7, 14, 27

420

Implications for improved environmental relevance of standardized testing. Given the

421

notable role of temperature driving both the rates and microbial communities implicated in CDA

422

degradation in the coastal ocean, our findings strongly advocate for incorporating temperature as

423

an experimental variable in assessment matrices and adopting open- versus closed-system

424

incubations. Current standard methods for assessing plastic degradation in marine environments

425

are typically performed at temperature (i.e., 30 °C) within the mesophilic range using closed-

426

systems (i.e., bottles) to assess degradation over time.52, 65 For instance, ASTM D6691 and ISO

427

22403 outline standard test methods that evaluate the biodegradation of plastics by marine

428

microorganisms at 30 °C in bottle incubations. Because 30 °C is nearly twice the global average

429

sea surface temperature of 16 °C,16, 26 and biodegradation is highly sensitive to water temperature

430

(Figure 1), the rates determined in standard method incubations are likely artificially high.33, 66

431

This discrepancy raises questions about the applicability of the timelines determined using

432

standard methods to what happens in natural waters.

433

Furthermore, because the standard test methods in marine environments are optimized for

434

activating mesophilic microorganisms,52, 65 and the communities driving degradation are sensitive

435

to temperature (Figures 4, 5, S6, and S8), the standard conditions are not directly translatable to

436

cooler, mid- and high-latitude waters where both psychrophilic and/or mesophilic microorganisms

437

dominate.23, 24 In such regions, the rate of degradation likely vary with the source of the seawater

438

due to the different metabolic activities of psychrophilic and mesophilic microbial communities.

439

The limited translation is amplified when using closed-system (e.g., bottle) incubations, as

440

prescribed by standard tests. In bottle incubations, natural microbial communities and nutrients are

441

not replenished over time, likely hindering the evolution of the material degrading consortium

442

throughout the months-long incubation. In contrast, open-systems, such as the flow-through

443

mesocosm approach taken in the current study, ensure that microbial communities and nutrients

444

are continuously replenished, thereby better reflecting what happens in nature. To improve the

445

accuracy of material degradation predictions and to better understand the long-term persistence of

446

marine debris across space and time, we propose that future assessment matrices account for the
