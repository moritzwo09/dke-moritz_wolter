Abstract
Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have significant environmental and health
hazards. Unfortunately, current PFAS degradation routes require higher temperatures or highly
corrosive conditions and/or lead to incomplete defluorination and generation of shorter alkyl
chains. Fortunately, fluorinated compounds are highly vulnerable to reduction. Inspired by the
lithium metal battery literature, we develop an ambient temperature and pressure
electrochemical degradation process that takes advantage of reactive metals and highly
reducing environments. We show that electrodeposited lithium metal can enable 95%
degradation and 94% defluorination of a long chain PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
without forming any shorter C2-C7 PFAS as end products. More importantly, we show
mineralization to LiF. Using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD), we reveal the degradation mechanism and show that electron transfer from Li to
PFOA leads to rapid C-F bond cleavage, the formation of fluoride, and carbon chain fragments.
We expand the scope to other PFAS compounds and of the 33 PFAS compounds tested, 22
demonstrated degradation amounts exceeding 70% (with some degradation up to 99%), and
complete mineralization to inorganic fluorides. Finally, we use the mineralized F− as a fluorine
source for the synthesis of fluorinated non-PFAS compound such as ethane sulfonyl fluoride
to complete a circular fluorine loop from waste to valuable product. Our work showcases a
novel electrochemical approach that borrows from the battery literature to solve challenges in
environmental remediation.

Introduction
Per- and poly- fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of thousands of man-made chemicals
that are ubiquitously used in consumer and industrial applications.1 These contain at least one
perfluorinated carbon (-CF3 or -CF2 with no H) and have a wide range of special properties
such as high chemical stability, water resistance, and more. Unfortunately, they are persistent
in the environment and are colloquially known as ‘forever chemicals.’ 2 Furthermore, they have
been implicated in a wide range of health-related concerns including cancer and immune
impairment.3, 4 Therefore, across the world, new regulations have been proposed or
implemented to curtail their use and limit their concentration in drinking water.5 Addressing
the PFAS challenge requires sensing, capture, and destruction. There are many sensing
approaches based on nanotechnology, biotechnology etc. that have been developed to sense
PFAS compounds at concentrations as low as 1 ppt.6, 7 Furthermore, carbon, and other sorbents
can capture a range of PFAS compounds.8-10 However, there are limited approaches to
permanently degrade and mineralize these PFAS compounds to fluoride.
PFAS degradation is of utmost importance because many of the environmental and health
exposures are a result of improper disposal and limited degradation technologies. Degradation
approaches have lagged because of the strength of the C-F bond. Several approaches such as
thermal, photo, chemical, and electrochemical approaches to PFAS destruction have been
studied.11-13 Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is one pollutant of great interest as it is ranked
among the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) top 10 and consistently observed in the
environment and in almost all humans.14 In addition, there are several legacy and current PFAS
compounds in wide production.
Electrochemical approaches are of great interest because they can be done under ambient
temperature and pressure conditions and take advantage of renewable electrons from solar and
wind.15 Electrochemical oxidation – not reduction – has been heavily explored. Electrodes such
as boron doped diamond (BDD) are state-of-the-art for electrochemical oxidation and are
primarily used not because it is an active catalyst for PFAS degradation but because it has a
high overpotential for oxygen evolution.16, 17 Hence, when electrochemical oxidation is
performed under aqueous conditions, the higher potentials required for PFAS oxidation can be
accessed. Unfortunately, BDD is very expensive.18
Fluorine is the most electronegative element known. Therefore, C-F bonds are highly resistant
to oxidation. In contrast, fluorinated compounds are vulnerable to reduction. In the field of
nonaqueous batteries such as lithium metal, fluorinated solvents and salts are state-of-the-art
due to their non-flammability, high thermal resistance, and oxidative stability.19, 20 At reductive
conditions and/or in contact with reactive metals such as lithium or sodium, these compounds
are known to degrade to form the solid electrolyte interface.21 Chemical and surface
characterization techniques show mineralization to F−.22 Furthermore, these reactive metals can
corrode at rest upon contact with these fluorinated solvents.23 In In the battery literature,
continuous reactivity between the fluorinated electrolyte and the metal electrode is highly
undesired and leads to poor battery cycling.24, 25 However, this is exactly what is desired for
PFAS degradation! Therefore, the challenges of fluorinated electrolyte instability and reaction
that plague metal batteries open a new approach and opportunity for pollutant degradation.
Inspired by the lithium metal battery21, 26, 27 and lithium mediated ammonia synthesis
literature,28, 29 we propose the investigation of PFAS degradation under reductive conditions

and in the presence of a reactive metal. There are fewer studies on electrochemical reduction
of PFAS that take advantage of the inherent reductive vulnerability of fluorinated compounds.
The generation of aqueous electrons (aq e-) for reductive degradation of PFAS in water
typically requires complex and energy-intensive methods such as plasma discharge, UV
irradiation or radiolysis.30 A major challenge is that these aq e- are highly reactive and can be
easily scavenged by H+ or O2 present in the water. This scavenging effect significantly limits
the availability of aq e- for effective PFAS degradation and often necessitates the use of
anaerobic conditions to mitigate this issue.31 We speculate that another reason for the dearth in
the literature is that if the reduction reaction is performed under aqueous conditions, the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) would occur before the potentials needed for PFAS
reduction.32 In addition, reactive metals such as lithium and sodium react violently with water.
However, while PFAS is often present in the environment in water or in soil, it can be captured,
concentrated and then destroyed in a different media. Therefore, to take advantage of reactive
metals and reduction potentials for PFAS degradation requires nonaqueous electrolytes.

Figure 1. Schematic of the proposed Li mediated PFOA degradation approach.
There have been some papers that explored the influence of nonaqueous solvents on PFAS
degradation. McCord et al. showed that different nonaqueous solvents such as dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) facilitate the decarboxylation of PFOA, which is often reported as the
gateway to degradation.33 Dichtel et al. used 30 M NaOH dissolved in a DMSO/water mixture
and showed that at elevated temperatures (120°C), decarboxylation can occur with subsequent
defluorination to fluoride.34 However, high temperatures are required, at least for the initial
decarboxylation step. Additionally, a highly corrosive NaOH electrolyte is necessary. Liu et al.
demonstrated PFOA degradation into shorter alkyl chains in aprotic solvents like N-Ndimethylformamide and acetonitrile using a Rh/Ni cathode.35 However, a reductive metal
mediated electrochemical method to degrade PFOA to inorganic fluorides at ambient
conditions without generating smaller chain PFAS remains unknown. While it is important to
degrade PFAS compounds, it is important to note that fluorine has been listed as a critical
element by the Department of Energy.36 Furthermore, there are numerous fluorinated
compounds that are not classified as PFAS. Therefore, mineralizing PFAS to F− and valorizing
the F− to synthesize non-PFAS fluorinated compounds would enable a circular fluorine
economy and upcycling to valuable products.

In this work, we develop a reactive metal-assisted degradation via electroreduction (ReMADE)
process for the remediation of halogenated compounds (Figure 1). The process occurs at
ambient temperature and pressure in a single chamber membrane-and-catalyst-free
electrochemical cell. We show that upon lithium metal electrodeposition, up to 95% PFOA
degradation and 94% defluorination can be achieved. More importantly, we reveal that no short
chain PFAS compounds are formed and almost complete mineralization to fluoride is achieved.
Our findings showcase a new process for the efficient and selective degradation of PFAS deeply
inspired by the lithium metal battery literature. We use the confluence of DFT (density
functional theory), AIMD (ab initio molecular dynamics), and spectroscopic tools to
understand the degradation mechanism. We also expand the ReMADE process scope by
probing other reactive metals and other PFAS compounds. Finally, we use the F− obtained from
PFAS degradation as the fluorine source for the synthesis of a non-PFAS fluorinated compound
(ethane sulfonyl fluoride, ESF) that has seen applications as an additive or solvent for batteries
as well as for pharmaceuticals.37, 38 The ReMADE process cleverly takes advantage of the
degradation challenges that batteries face and unleashes them for other electrochemical
transformations such as electrosynthesis, electrocatalysis, and environmental remediation.

Rationale for process and proof-of-concept
The reactivity of ‘reactive’ metals such as lithium towards PFOA was first studied chemically.
We focus on PFOA as it is the most prevalent of PFAS compounds. Lithium metal was added
to a solution containing 10 mM of dissolved PFOA. As Figure 1 (a) shows, we choose solvents
such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethers, and carbonates that are relatively stable against
lithium metal and have been studied in the lithium metal battery literature.39-42 In contrast,
acetonitrile reacts violently with lithium metal and was not explored.43 After 24 hours of
exposure of the lithium metal piece to PFOA in the different solvents (Figure 1 (b)), the lithium
metal surface was studied using XPS. Across all the solvents studied, mineralization to LiF was
observed as shown in the F 1s XPS (Figure 1 (c, d)).44, 45 A Cu foil was also examined in
DMSO as a control that shows the presence of C-F2 and Cu-F peak46 indicating that these
interactions are arising by residual PFOA on the surface. Residual PFOA can also be seen at
the lithium surface for the carbonate-based solvents. For DMSO, it appears that the fraction of
LiF seen is much higher compared to the other solvents.
The supernatant was also studied using 19F solution NMR (Figure 1 (e)). Interestingly,
dissolved LiF was also observed when DMSO is used as the solvent. We assign the fluoride
peak at 166.6 ppm following a LiF in DMSO control (Figure S1). There were no observations
of smaller chain fluorinated compounds. Although the XPS data in other aprotic solvents like
EC/DEC and PC show LiF formation, there is no observation of F− in solution. We attribute
this to lower LiF solubility in carbonate solvents compared to DMSO and the absolute lower
amount of LiF formed (as seen in the XPS data).47, 48 The combination of XPS and NMR
irrefutably show that reactive metals such as lithium can enable PFOA degradation and
mineralization to fluoride. However, as a surface driven reaction, fresh new lithium metal
surface will always be needed. Therefore, an electrochemical process was developed.
Electrochemical degradation of PFOA
An ambient temperature, pressure, electrochemical process was developed to enhance PFAS
degradation. As Figure S2 shows, the electrochemical cell consists of an organic solvent,
dissolved salt, a Cu working electrode, a Pt or graphite counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+
leakless reference electrode. For lithium metal batteries, fluorinated salts such as LiFSI (lithium
bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide) and LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide) are state-ofthe-art as they have been shown to enable high Coulombic efficiencies (stripping
capacity/deposition capacity).37 However, since we are interested in PFOA degradation, we
avoid any other fluorine source. Hence, salts such as ClO4- and NO3- were studied. These salts
limit the type of solvents that can be explored to ensure sufficient salt dissolution and high
ionic conductivity. Hence, a range of electrolytes were explored and compositions that yielded
ionic conductivities > 3 mS/cm were studied (Table S1). Regardless, an interesting
philosophical question that guides the proposed approaches and distinguishes it starkly from
lithium metal batteries: do we want electrolytes that support high lithium metal Coulombic
efficiency or not? High CE electrolytes often have low surface area and limited reaction with
lithium metal. However, we do want large surface area and greater reactivity with PFAS.
Hence, the guiding principles for lithium metal batteries will differ from reactive metal
mediated reactions.

First, TBAClO4 (tetrabutylammonium perchlorate) salt was used to ascertain the impact of the
applied potential and current density by direct electroreduction (DE) without the presence of
lithium. Using a current density of 50 mA/cm2 with a catalyst-free Cu working electrode,
significant degradation of PFOA and mineralization to F− is observed at ambient conditions
(Figure 3). Using a combination of a fluoride ion selective electrode (ISE, Supplementary
note 1) and 19F NMR (Supplementary note 2), over 69 % of PFOA degrades and 70 %
defluorination occurs to F−. This observation further reinforces the promise of reductive
potentials for dehalogenation reactions in contrast to conventional oxidative processes that are
used. Jiang et al. also recently explored a molecular catalyst for reductive PFAS degradation
and mineralization.49 However, the process requires the synthesis of a new catalyst. In addition,
the molecular catalyst was dissolved in the same solution as the PFAS making it difficult to
separate the catalyst from the final fluorinated products.
Lithium metal-mediated degradation
When LiClO4 is added as the salt and lithium metal is allowed to deposit, the degradation
process is significantly enhanced by lithium-mediated electroreduction, LME (Figure 3 (a-c)).
Figure S3 shows that lithium metal is electrodeposited at these current densities as a shiny
luster is present. Furthermore, the electrochemical profile shows the nucleation and growth
overpotentials associated with lithium metal electrodeposition. As the 19F NMR spectra in
Figure 3 (d) shows, almost all the PFOA is converted to F−. The degradation increases to 95%
for PFOA and defluorination conversion up to 94 % (Figure S4-5). There are minute
concentrations of TFA (trifluoroacetate) and no other smaller chain fluorinated compounds. Ion
chromatography (IC) analysis identified formate as another degradation product, with no other
detectable products observed (Supplementary Note 4, Figure S6-8).
For simplicity and future scalability, we use a single chamber membraneless cell. To
demonstrate that PFOA is the sole source of fluorine in the reaction, it was conducted in the
absence of any other potential fluorine sources, such as PTFE stir bars or Teflon-coated
electrodes. Figure S9 illustrates the degradation of PFOA and the formation of LiF both in the
electrolyte and on the electrode surface, confirming that PFOA degradation is the exclusive
source of fluoride ions. However, there is a need to clearly show that it is the lithium metal and
the reductive process that leads to PFOA degradation and not oxidation. Therefore, we
fabricated an H-Cell consisting of a Nafion cation exchange membrane to segregate the
catholyte and anolyte chambers. Figure S10-11 shows that the Nafion membrane can
substantially limit PFOA and LiF crossover. When PFOA is added to the catholyte chamber,
F− is readily observed. In contrast, when PFOA is added to the anolyte chamber, F− is not
observed in the anolyte chamber, but only again in the catholyte chamber where we assume
that some PFOA crossed over and degraded. Interestingly, regardless of whether PFOA was
added to the catholyte or anolyte, LiF was observed on the surface of working electrode. This
indicates that PFOA interacts with the Li surface, leading to the formation of LiF at the
interface. For the single chamber experiments, we estimate the Coulombic efficiency
(Supplementary Note 3) for PFOA degradation and conversion to fluorides in DMSO to be
~7.7%, which is higher than other reported electrochemical approaches (reductive or
oxidative).49, 50 To further improve this would involve optimization of the electrochemical cell,
electrolyte composition, electrodes, and operating conditions.

The interfacial composition of the lithium metal and electrode surface was probed using XPS.
For TBA-based electrolytes, the copper electrode was studied. Figure 3 (e-g) shows little/no
degradation products on the copper surface for TBA indicating that the Cu doesn’t participate
directly in the reaction and serves primarily as a shuttle for electrons. All the fluorinated
degradation products such as TBA-F are known to have high solubilities in organic media and
are not present on the electrode surface but only in solution (see NMR data, Figure S12). In
contrast, the electrodeposited lithium shows breakdown and defluorination of PFOA to F− on
the surface, mirroring some of the observations made in the proof-of-concept.

Probing electrochemical reaction space
The influence of electrochemical variables such as current density, electrolyte, and electrode
was further explored. The influence of reductive current on PFOA degradation was studied by
varying the applied current density from 10 to 50 mA/cm2 (Figure S13). As Figure 4(a) shows,
current density plays an important role in the PFOA degradation. Even current densities as low
as 10 mA/cm2 show mineralization to F− while the degradation at 40 mA/cm2 largely mirrors
that at 50 mA/cm2. The 19F NMR analysis reveals a progressive increase in the formation of
LiF as a product, accompanied by a reduction in PFOA concentration (Figure 4 (b)). The
reaction follows a pseudo first order reaction (Supplementary note 5, Figure 4 (c)) with a rate
constant of 0.096 h-1. An important observation for the degradation reactions in DMSO across
all these current densities is that no smaller chain fluorinated residues are observed (which are
typically reported in thermal and oxidative pathways).51-53 Since the total amount of time is
fixed while the current density varies, the amount of charge varies (Figure S14). As the total
amount of charge applied increases, the PFOA degradation extent increases as shown in Figure
4 (d). At the same fixed charge, there do appear to be differences in degradation extents, which
we attribute to differences in the observed voltages. The influence of the anode was also studied
with platinum and graphite showing similar overall cell voltages and no effect on the overall
degradation (Figure S15). The anodic reaction was not optimized and is currently solvent
oxidation. Future work can incorporate water for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or
use a boron doped diamond (BDD) electrode to enable simultaneous reductive and oxidative
PFAS destruction. It has been widely reported that electrolyte selection plays an important role
in controlling lithium metal deposition efficiency, morphology, interfacial composition and
more.21, 54-57 Therefore, the influence of electrolyte selection on the electrochemical
degradation process was explored. Figure 4 (e) shows that there is a significant electrolyte
dependence, with PC showing the poorest degradation efficiencies while the EC: DG mixture
is much closer to the DMSO-based system.
We also fabricated lithium metal batteries using these electrolytes to probe their influence on
lithium metal CE (Supplementary Note 5). As Figure S16 qualitatively shows, electrolytes
that support low Li metal CE have higher PFOA degradation efficiencies. Although we do not
want solvent competition with PFOA, we also do not want excellent electrolytes. These
findings upend the heuristics for lithium metal batteries; hence electrolytes that have been
discarded due to poor battery cycling – of which there are a multitude – can be resurrected for
reactive metal degradation reactions. The influence of electrolyte selection on the lithium metal
deposition morphology was also probed. Figure 4 (f-k) shows SEM images of lithium
deposited at different current densities and with different electrolytes. In DMSO, the SEM of
the samples reveal decrease in Li particle size with increasing current (Figure 4 (f-h)). As
expected, the deposited lithium is highly porous with large active surface area for reaction with
PFOA.

DFT investigation to understand degradation mechanism

Density functional theory (DFT) was performed to garner mechanistic insight into the
degradation process (Supplementary Note 7). The calculations refer to PFOA near a small
lithium crystal – Li (110) – in the presence of solvents whose influence is treated implicitly,
and with all atoms free to move except for the Li’s which are assumed fixed. The geometry of
the PFOA molecule that is obtained from energy minimization of the starting structure is shown
in Figure 4 (l) and S18. Figure 4 (l) shows significant fragmentation of the PFOA, with the
results significantly altered in some solvent environments compared to others (Figure S19). In
DMSO (dielectric constant (ε) ≈ 46.7), PC (≈ 64), and EC (≈ 89.78), the PFOA molecule is
pushed away from the Li surface during the geometry relaxation process, with all C-F bonds
degraded and the carbon chain becoming linear. The carbon chain structures are similar to the
known structures of small anionic polyacetylenic carbon clusters with the same number of
atoms,58, 59 although in this case the carboxylate group (which has a Bader charge of 1.24 e) is
not dissociated from the chain. In contrast, in low dielectric constant solvents, DG (≈ 7.2) and
DEC (≈ 2.805), and in the gas phase, the PFOA molecule is attracted to the Li surface, and only
roughly half of the C-F bonds are broken (Figure S19). To understand this behavior, the charge
transfer dynamics was analyzed in both the gas phase and DMSO solvent systems. The results
show (Figure S19) that the number of electrons transferred (ΔQ) is significantly higher when
PFOA is solvated in DMSO, with 15.8 electrons transferred from the Li surface to the PFOA
molecule, while the gas phase charge transfer is ~ 12.0 electrons. For both DMSO and vacuum,
the high number of electrons transferred leads to substantial C-F bond degradation, but only
DMSO result leads to complete defluorination, similar to the experimental observations. While
this model is oversimplified compared to the experiment, these calculations suggest the
conditions needed to remove all fluorines from PFOA. Note that the transfer of ~16 electrons
to PFOA and degradation of 12 F− leave the carbon fragment negatively charged such that it is
repelled by F− near the Li surface. Also, many of the F− end up solvated in the DMSO, while
others enter the lattice.
The effects of other solvent environments were investigated, including PC, DEC, EC, and DG.
In the PC and EC solvents, we observed similar 100% C-F bond degradation, with charge
transfers of 19.5 e and 17.0 e, respectively. These solvents, like DMSO, have relatively high
dielectric constants, which likely contribute to the efficient charge transfer and subsequent CF bond degradation. In the DEC and DG solvents, the lower dielectric constants lead to less
stabilization of charged intermediates, less charge transfer and bond degradation. In DEC, we
observed a lower C-F bond degradation fraction of 53.3%, with the corresponding charge
transfer is 10.1 e. In DG, the C-F bond degradation fraction is 73.3%, similar to the gas phase,
with a charge transfer of 13.9 e.
Overall, the DFT results show that these solvents are capable of supporting PFOA degradation
to some extent, but only allow DMSO, PC, and EC allow for complete degradation. The
superior performance of DMSO compared to the other solvents must therefore be interpreted
in terms of the other factors mentioned earlier (solubility of LiF and Li porosity) that are not
included in our modeling.

AIMD studies to understand the effect of electric field

To simulate the influence of an applied electrochemical potential on PFOA degradation, AIMD
simulations were conducted at 0 K for 5 ps with and without an electric field perpendicular to
a Li surface. The simulations aimed to understand the degradation mechanisms under different
electric field conditions, specifically under a +0.5 eV/Å (reductive environment) and a -0.5
eV/Å (oxidative environment) electric field in DMSO solvent. Under a reductive environment
(+0.5 eV/Å) in DMSO solvent, significant degradation was observed, with the breaking of eight
C-F bonds and formation of Li-F bonds and F¯ ions at 0.025 ps (Figure S20 (a)), and further
bond degradations leading to a variety of fragments by 0.5 ps, similar to the energy-minimized
result in Figure 4(l). However, due to implicit solvent effects, only the short-term results (up
to 0.0325 ps) are expected to be representative of actual experiments. The positive electric field
enhances electron transfer from the Li surface to PFOA, corresponding to reductive conditions.
The enhanced charge transfer (9.3 e) under the positive field correlates with higher PFOA
defluorination (86.7%), accelerating degradation (Figure S19 (b)).
In contrast, a negative electric field (-0.5 eV/Å, oxidation) resulted in slower and less complete
degradation, with bond breakages and fragment formation observed more gradually. This
corresponds to oxidative conditions, where an oxidative process involves the loss of electrons
from PFOA. Charge transfer from the Li surface to PFOA was lower (7.0 e) under the negative
field, correlating with less defluorination (26.7%). The reduced rate of C-F bond degradation
and fragmentation is consistent with the lower electron transfer to PFOA under these
conditions.
The difference in degradation efficiency between positive and negative electric fields is
attributed to charge transfer dynamics. The significant electronegativity difference between Li
and PFOA atoms facilitates electron transfer from Li, weakening C-F bonds and promoting
degradation. Under reductive conditions with a positive electric field, this process is more
pronounced, leading to greater and faster PFOA degradation compared to oxidative conditions
with a negative electric field.
Expanding reaction scope
Reactive metal mediated electrochemical reactions hold promise beyond lithium metal and
beyond PFOA. Tackling the challenge of breaking down a wide variety of PFAS compounds
requires methods that are both effective and versatile. Beyond the well-known PFAS like PFOA
and GenX, the EPA has identified 40 PFAS across different structural categories.60 These PFAS
compounds are commonly found in wastewater, groundwater, soil, sediments, and fish tissue
and EPA developed the popular Method 1633 to detect these 40 PFAS in various sources.
The application of the LME (lithium-mediated electroreduction) and DE (Direct
Electroreduction) methods to these PFAS reveals promising trends. For perfluoroalkyl
carboxylic acids (CnF(2n+1)CO2H, where n = 3 to 12), both methods demonstrate greater
degradation efficiency for longer-chain PFAS compared to shorter-chain ones (Figure S21).
For example, the degradation is 99.1 % for PFUnA (n = 10) compared to 4 % for PFBA (n=3)
as shown in Figure 5. This chain-length-dependent degradation has been observed in the
literature, attributed to the more hydrophobic nature of longer-chain PFAS. Their increased
hydrophobicity facilitates easier adsorption onto the reactive interface, in contrast to shorterchain PFAS.61, 62 Perfluorosulfonic acids, fluorotelomer carboxylic and sulfonic acids exhibit
a similar trend, with higher degradation efficiencies observed for longer-chain PFAS.

value represents the degradation %, while the second indicates the defluorination % achieved
using the LME and DE methods, respectively
Additionally, the LME method effectively degrades other PFAS classes, including
perfluorooctane sulfonamide ethanols, sulfonamides, and per- and polyfluoroether carboxylic
acids as shown in Figure 5. Notably, in all cases, the degradation percentage and defluorination
efficiency achieved through LME consistently outperform those obtained with DE,
highlighting the potential of LME for broader applicability and superior outcomes in PFAS
mitigation efforts.

The modular nature of the process allows a different reactive metal to be studied if the relevant
salt is available. Beyond lithium, we experimentally explored other reactive metals such as
potassium by incorporating a potassium salt. Figure S23 shows that K can enable 34 %
degradation of PFOA to KF. Differences between Li and K primarily involve differences in the
higher K electrolyte solution resistance (compared to Li) in the electrolytes studied here.
Further optimization of the K-based electrolyte will be needed.
Valorization of degraded PFAS to non-PFAS product

The Department of Energy has listed fluorine as a critical element for energy; however, PFAS
as discussed so far is a waste product. Therefore, recovering the fluorides obtained from PFAS
degradation and converting them to non-PFAS fluorinated products can close the fluorine loop.
We focus on KF since it has been reported widely as a reagent for fluorination reactions, and
the synthesis of ethane sulfonyl fluoride (as an exemplar) because of its use in battery
applications as well as in drug discovery. 37, 38 More importantly, ESF is not considered a PFAS
by any definition. We first conduct the synthesis of ESF using commercial KF, following
literature procedure for synthesizing sulfonyl fluorides (Figure S24).63, 64 This served as a
reference. After the degradation of PFOA, the resulting KF is separated from the DMSO

Figure 6. (a) Schematic showing the workflow from mineralization of PFAS to separation of
fluorides and valorization to non-PFAS product, (b) 1H NMR depicting the formation of ESF

electrolyte using multiple methods; either washing the cathode surface or ion exchange
chromatography (Figure 6(a), Figure S25, Supplementary note 9). The collected fluoride is
washed with water and concentrated using a rotary evaporator to obtain a saturated KF solution.
This solution is then reacted with ethane sulfonyl chloride (ESCl), as a biphasic mixture. As
shown in Figure 6 (b), the 1H NMR spectra reveal a gradual decrease in the ESCl peaks and a

corresponding increase in the ESF peaks, indicating the successful conversion of ESCl to ESF
over two days. By the end of the reaction, only the ESF peak is observed with 82% yield
(Figure 6 (c)). This process demonstrates a successful upcycling pathway, converting PFAS
degradation products into ESF, a valuable non-PFAS fluorinated compound.
Our work on reactive metal-mediated electrochemical reactions provides an ambient
temperature, pressure process that can take advantage of renewable electrons (solar, wind) in a
modular manner. Future work will take advantage of other reactive metals (e.g., Na, Mg) with
more positive reduction potentials (compared to Li) that have been shown in the battery
literature to lead to defluorination. 65, 66 Furthermore, other compounds such as halogenated
products (e.g., chloro-, bromo-) and polymers (e.g., chloro and fluoro-polymers) will be
pursued. Finally, the confluence of reductive degradation and reactive metals enabled by
careful electrolyte engineering changes the paradigm of electrochemical reactions ranging from
electrocatalysis to electrosynthesis to environmental degradation.
Conclusions
A novel Li metal mediated electrochemical route was developed for PFOA degradation as part
of a broader process we term ReMADE (reactive metal-assisted degradation reactive metalassisted degradation via electroreduction). The ambient temperature, pressure, catalyst-free
system led to up to 94 % defluorination of PFOA after 24 hours under highly reductive
environment in DMSO. Notably, in the absence of Li, the degradation proceeds partially on a
pristine Cu surface, which indicates that reductive conditions are important. LiF is the major
degradation product and no shorter alkyl chain compounds were seen apart from trace amounts
of TFA (trifluoroacetate). Increase in reductive current enhances the degradation due to
improved availability of the Li active surface area with decrease in Li nucleation size. We show
that electrolyte choice is important with DMSO supporting high defluorination and LiF
solubility. DFT and AIMD results provide further insight and show that the degradation is
associated with degradation of C-F bonds that occurs because of electron transfer from Li to
the PFOA in DMSO, leaving behind F-, LiF and a carboxylated carbon chain. We study the
influence of lithium metal mediated degradation with other fluorinated compounds and show
degradation. The degradation % achieved through LME consistently surpass those obtained
with DE and out of the 33 PFAS tested, 22 demonstrated degradation exceeding 70%, with
PFUnA and PFDA achieving a remarkable degradation of 99%. Furthermore, we explore other
alkali metals such as potassium. Finally, we valorize the inorganic fluorides from PFOA
degradation for the synthesis of fluorinated non-PFAS products. Inspired by the battery
literature, we take the disadvantages that plague electrolyte development for reactive metalbased batteries and exploit them for desired halogenated compound degradation. Our findings
are relevant for several electrochemical transformations such as electrocatalysis,
electrosynthesis, and environmental remediation.

rpm. The initial PFOA concentration was 1 mM with 0.5 M LiClO4 or TBAClO4 in 5 mL of
DMSO, unless otherwise specified.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend instrument (400 MHz) using a capillary setup
inside a Wilmad NMR tube. An internal standard (2 mM LiTFSI) in deuterated DMSO was
placed inside a capillary tube and capped with a PTFE cover. For analysis, 400 μL of the sample
was used, and the capillary with the internal standard in DMSO-d6 was added.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
All the XPS measurements were carried out using the Physical Electronics, PHI 5000
VersaProbe II System equipped with an Al Ka radiation (hν = 1,486.6 eV) beam (100 μm, 25
W). Cu foil (0.5*6 cm2) is used as the working electrode for investigating XPS which is masked
with tape to have an exposed surface area of 0.5*0.5 cm2 immersed in the electrolyte. The
electrodeposition of Li is done inside an Ar-filled glovebox. After electrodeposition, the area
with Li deposition on the foil is cut and rinsed three times with dimethoxy ethane (DME) and
transferred to a glass vial. The foil is dried in glovebox antechamber for 30 minutes under
vacuum to get rid of any residual solvent. The data was fitted using CasaXPS software67 with
C-C peak in C 1s referenced at 284.8 eV.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM images are taken on a Carl Zeiss Merlin field emission SEM with an accelerating voltage
of 15 kV. Cu foil is used as the working electrode to deposit Li (similar to sample preparation
mentioned above for XPS). The deposition capacity for all the samples was fixed to 2
mAh/cm2. After electrodeposition, the samples were washed with DME three times, transferred
into a vial and moved to the glovebox antechamber for drying.
Ion chromatography (IC)
A Shimadzu LC-20Ai IC system consisting of a conductivity detector (CDD-10AVP) was used
to obtain all ion chromatograms. 10 µL sample was injected into the column using an
autosampler (SIL-20AC). Separations were carried out on an analytical column (Shodex IC
NI-424, anion-specific) coupled with a guard column (Shodex IC IA-G). The column was
maintained at 40°C, with a run time of 20 minutes. For optimal peak separation of various
anions, two mobile phases were utilized. The first mobile phase consisted of 8 mM 4Hydroxybenzoic acid, 1.9 mM Bis-Tris, 2 mM Phenylboronic acid, and 0.005 mM trans-1,2Diaminocyclohexane-N, N, N’, N’-tetraacetic acid in aqueous solution. The second mobile
phase was identical, except for the exclusion of Bis-Tris. Data collection and processing were
performed using the LabSolutions software.
Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS)
A Shimadzu GCMS-QP2020 NX single quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with an HS20 Headspace autosampler, was employed to analyze post-degradation samples. Separation
was achieved using an SH-Q-BOND column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 10 μm) with helium as the
carrier gas. The detector temperature was maintained at 40 °C, and 1 mL of undiluted sample
was used for analysis.

Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)
LCMS data was collected using a Shimadzu Nexera LC-40DXR UHPLC coupled with a
LCMS-2050 single quadrupole detector. Separation was carried out with two mobile phases:
mobile phase A consisted of acetonitrile, while mobile phase B was 5 mM aqueous ammonium
acetate. A Shimadzu Nexcol C18 column (1.8 μm, 50 × 2.1 mm) was used for the separation,
with an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 guard column (1.8 μm, 3 × 5 mm). The column temperature
was maintained at 40 °C. Samples were diluted to a total volume of 500 μL using a 1:1 mixture
of water and acetonitrile, with 5 μL of injection volume for each run.
