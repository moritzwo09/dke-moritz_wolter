Abstract

11

The widespread contamination of the environment by microplastics (MPs), particularly

12

polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE), poses significant ecological and health concerns.

13

While much attention has been given to the physical impact of MPs, their molecular

14

interactions, particularly with genetic material, remain largely unexplored. This study

15

examines how PS and PE MPs influence the structure and stability of human alternative i-

16

motif (iM) DNA, which plays a key role in regulating gene expression and maintaining

17

genomic integrity. Using biophysical techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, circular

18

dichroism (CD), FT-IR spectroscopy, and thermal melting analysis, our results have

19

demonstrated the effects of PS-MPs and PE-MPs of different sizes on HRAS2 iM DNA. Our

20

results reveal that PS-MPs, particularly those with a 100 nm diameter, strongly interact with

21

HRAS2 iM DNA, causing hypochromism and shifts in the UV-Vis spectra, along with

22

changes in secondary structure observed by CD. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed alterations in

23

DNA conformation, and thermal melting data showed increased stability of the HRAS2 iM

DNA in the presence of PS-MPs. In contrast, PE-MPs exhibited weaker interactions, likely

25

due to differences in size and surface properties. These findings suggest that PS-MPs, due to

26

their small size, may disrupt the structural integrity of iM DNA, potentially affecting gene

27

regulation. This work highlights the need to consider both the physical and biochemical

28

properties of MPs in assessing their environmental and health risks.

Introduction

32

Plastic pollution has become a critical global issue of the 21st century, with

33

microplastics (MPs) becoming a ubiquitous contaminant in ecosystems worldwide, from

34

oceans to remote environments. These small particles pose significant threats to both wildlife

35

and human health, as they are increasingly detected in human tissues such as the liver, lungs,

36

and kidneys. Recent studies have revealed the presence of MPs in the human body, acquired

37

through ingestion, inhalation, or skin exposure, raises concerns about their potential

38

toxicological effects [1]. MPs, particularly Polystyrene (PS) and Polyethylene (PE), are

39

widely distributed pollutants in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. PS, commonly

40

found in packaging, disposable products, and insulation materials, accumulates in ecosystems

41

due to its resistance to degradation, with significant concentrations in marine waters and

42

sediments. Similarly, PE, the most produced plastic globally, contributes heavily to MP

43

pollution, especially in urban and coastal regions. Both materials are highly persistent, often

44

detected in remote areas like the Arctic and deep oceans, where they pose risks to organisms

45

through bioaccumulation. These pervasive pollutants, resistant to environmental breakdown,

46

raise concerns over their long-term ecological impact and potential toxicological effects on

47

wildlife and humans [2]. Approximately 3% of the genome is composed of simple DNA

48

repetitions that are capable of generating alternative (non-B) DNA structures. I-motif (iM)

49

DNA structures are the alternative, dynamic, non-canonical cytosine-rich tetraplex structures,

50

where the base pairing of cytosines occurs through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding at acidic pH

51

[3]. When found in promoter regions of genes, iMs can function as molecular switches that

52

regulate gene expression [4]. These structures have significant biological roles in cellular

53

processes, including genomic stability, gene transcription, translation, replication, as well as

54

centromere and telomere functions [5].

55

Recent studies have employed a range of multispectroscopic techniques to examine

56

the interactions between non-canonical DNA structures like iMs and various molecules [6-9].

57

We have previously published research detailing how microplastics (MPs) influence the

58

structural configurations of human G-quadruplex DNA, another alternative DNA structure

59

[10]. However, to date, there has been no exploration into the interactions between iM DNA

60

structures and MPs, which is critical for understanding the potential negative effects of MPs

61

on human health. Any DNA double strand capable of forming a G-quadruplex in one strand,

62

has the potential to generate iMs on its complementary strand. Therefore, in this study, we

63

aim to investigate the interactions between PS-MPs and PE-MPs with different iM DNAs.

64

Due to their smaller size (100 nm), PS-MPs have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

65

Environmental research regarding the effects of MPs on iM DNAs remains limited, as the

66

molecular mechanisms behind the dynamic interactions between PE/PS-MPs and iM DNAs

67

are still poorly understood. If MPs cause structural changes in human iM DNA, these

68

alterations could affect the functionality of iM DNA. Understanding the molecular processes

69

behind the interactions between PE/PS-MPs and human genetic material is essential for

70

evaluating potential health risks.

71

This research aims to explore the growing concern of MPs in human health, focusing

72

on their interactions with iM DNAs and the potential biological consequences. By

73

understanding these interactions, we hope to shed light on the mechanisms through which

74

MPs may contribute to genetic and cellular damage in human tissues and also causes

75

environmental damage. By examining these interactions, this work will provide novel

76

insights into the potential long-term health risks posed by MP exposure. The findings of this

77

study are significant, as this could lead to the development of better risk assessment models

78

for MP exposure and inform strategies to mitigate its potential impact on human health. By

79

employing various biophysical methods such as UV-Vis, CD, FT-IR, and thermal melting,

80

the study can examine alterations at several stages—from molecular binding to changes in

81

DNA structure and stability. This diverse approach ensures an in-depth understanding of the

82

interactions between microplastics and iM DNAs at molecular level, which is essential for

83

assessing the potential health risks posed by MP exposure.

84

Experimental

85

Materials, oligonucleotides and stock solution preparation

86

Sigma Aldrich supplied various iM-forming DNA sequences (HRAS1, HRAS2,

87

VEGF, CMYC, H-Telo), duplex DNA, and polystyrene (PS-MPs) and polyethylene (PE-

88

MPs) microplastics, with sizes ranging from 34–50 μm and 100 nm, respectively. The

89

HRAS1, HRAS2, VEGF, CMYC, and H-Telo sequences are present in the promoter regions

90

of their respective genes, playing key roles in gene regulation and expression. PS-MPs and

91

PE-MPs were thoroughly mixed with Milli-Q water using ultrasonic waves for thirty minutes

92

to achieve final concentrations of 1 mg/ml for both PS-MPs and PE-MPs. Prior to use, the

93

stock solution was sonicated for an additional thirty minutes in a bath with ultrasonic waves.

94

Desalted DNA sequences were dissolved in double-distilled water and stored at 4°C. To form

95

iM DNA and duplex structures, a specific amount of DNA from the main stock was added to

96

the buffer solution, and the mixtures were heated at 95°C for 5 minutes. The solutions were

then allowed to cool gradually to room temperature (25°C) before being kept overnight at

98

4°C. All experiments were conducted using a buffer solution composed of 1 mM K2EDTA,

The buffer solution was used as a reference for each scan. A 1 mm path-length cuvette was

110

employed, with the HRAS2 iM and duplex DNA concentrations maintained at 20 μM. The

The thermal melting curves were normalized and analysed using the curve fitting tool in

Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)

123

The structural characteristics of the samples were examined using Fourier Transform

124

Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Specific vibrational peaks in the IR spectra provided distinct

125

identifiers for various iM and duplex DNA conformations. FT-IR spectra of HRAS2 iM and

126

duplex DNA in the presence and absence of PS-MPs were recorded with a Spotlight 400 FT-

127

IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, UK) at room temperature (25°C). The samples were quickly

128

dried on a zinc-selenium plate with an infrared light lamp, and spectra were obtained from

129

over 120 scans at a resolution of 2 cm-1. The spectrum of a blank ATR plate was used as a

130

reference. Spectral profiles in the 800-2500 cm-1 frequency range were analysed using the

131

Baseline Correction method in the Opus 7.5 Bruker Optics application. Measurements were

132

performed on liquid samples.

All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the results were analysed for statistical

139

One powerful approach to exploring the molecular interactions of various iM DNAs is

140

through UV-Vis absorption studies, which provide valuable insights into the binding process

141

[6,11]. In our study, we analyzed the UV-Vis absorption spectra of different iM DNA types

142

(HRAS1, HRAS2, VEGF, CMYC, H-Telo iM DNA, and duplex DNA) both in the presence

143

and absence of PS-MPs and PE-MPs to understand the preferential binding patterns. Both PS-

144

MPs and PE-MPs showed no absorption or emission in the DNA’s characteristic wavelength

145

range (220-320 nm), meaning no spectral changes could be attributed to binding interactions

146

between PS/PE-MPs and iM/duplex DNA (Fig. S1).

Fig. 1 UV-Vis absorption spectra of [A] HRAS2 iM, [B] Duplex (2 μM) in the absence and presence of
successive additions of PS-MPs (0-100 μg/ml) (iM buffer, pH-5.4; Duplex buffer, pH-7.4; temp. 250 C).
147

When increasing amounts of PS-MPs (ranging from 0 to 100 μg/ml) were added,

148

HRAS2 iM DNA exhibited a notable reduction in absorbance (15.90% hypochromism) along

149

with a significant 5 nm red shift in the absorbance maximum (Fig. 1A). This drop in

150

absorption, accompanied by the red shift, suggests a polarity transfer within the PS-MPs,

151

likely due to their selective interaction with HRAS2 iM DNA structures. This degree of

152

hypochromism and red shifting was much more pronounced compared to other PS-MPs and

153

PE-MPs-iM DNA complexes (Fig. 1B, Fig. S2, Fig. S3, and Table 1). Further analysis of

154

UV absorption changes, both increases and decreases, revealed that PS-MPs exhibit strong

155

binding to HRAS2 iM DNA. Based on these findings, subsequent investigations were

156

designed to explore this interaction in more detail.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectral Measurements

161

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a powerful method for detecting changes in

162

the conformation of iM DNA and identifying its essential characteristics, particularly those

163

influenced by interactions with various substances [12]. In our study, CD spectroscopy was

164

used to investigate dynamic changes and secondary structures of HRAS2 iM and duplex

165

DNA, along with any structural modifications induced by the binding of PS-MPs. It was

166

observed that PS-MPs did not produce any spectral changes in the CD profile within the iM

167

DNA’s characteristic wavelength range (240-320 nm), indicating that PS-MPs did not bind to

168

HRAS2 iM DNA (Fig. S4).

169

Without PS-MPs, HRAS2 iM and duplex DNA displayed a positive band at 290 nm

170

and 276 nm, as well as negative bands at 264 nm and 246 nm—these bands are markers for

171

the iM and duplex DNA structures (Fig. 2). However, significant changes in the CD profile

172

were observed after adding PS-MPs to HRAS2 iM DNA, particularly in the band intensities

173

(Fig. 2A). For duplex DNA, no major changes were detected upon the addition of PS-MPs

174

(Fig. 2B). Notably, our analysis revealed substantial alterations in the band intensities of

175

HRAS2 iM DNA as the concentration of PS-MPs increased. The CD analysis suggests that

176

these changes were primarily due to alterations in the secondary structure of HRAS2 iM,

177

without noticeable shifts in the wavelength. Additionally, as the concentration of PS-MPs

178

increased, the band intensity of HRAS2 iM also increased, indicating that higher

179

concentrations of PS-MPs lead to more significant disruptions in its secondary structure. The

180

changes in band intensities primarily reflect structural modifications of HRAS2 iM DNA in

181

the presence of PS-MPs.

182

Thermal (UV) melting analysis

183

Thermal melting/UV melting experiments were performed to examine how PS-MPs

184

affect the structural stability of HRAS2 iM and duplex DNA. The melting temperature (Tm)

185

for each detectable transition was determined by identifying the midpoint of the melting

186

curve [13]. Tm was estimated using the absorption values of iM DNA bases at 295 nm and

187

duplex DNA at 260 nm. No melting profile was observed for PS-MPs at 295 nm, indicating

188

that no spectral changes could be attributed to PS-MPs binding with HRAS2 iM DNA (Fig.

189

S5). The melting profiles and temperature variations, with and without PS-MPs, are shown in

190

Fig. 3A and 3B. The addition of 50 μg/ml PS-MPs increased the thermal stability of HRAS2

191

iM DNA by approximately 3°C (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PS-MPs were found to destabilize

192

duplex DNA, lowering the Tm by 1°C at a concentration of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 3B). Thermal

193

melting analysis further suggests that PS-MPs enhance the stability of HRAS2 iM DNA.

Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) measurements

196

To gain a deeper understanding of the rapid structural changes and interpretations that

197

occur upon direct exposure of cytosine-rich iM DNA sequences to illumination, the spectrum

198

variations linked to the dynamics and mechanisms of iM structure formation were monitored

199

using FT-IR spectroscopy [14]. A considerable fluctuation in the spectrum within the 800-

200

2500 cm-1 range can be attributed to the vibrational stretches of the in-plane C=C double

201

bonds in the ring structure and the carbonyl groups of the bases. As depicted in Figure 4, FT-

202

IR spectra show peaks between 800 and 2500 cm-1, indicating that the iM DNA structures

203

remain stable even under the hydration conditions tested. It was observed that in the FT-IR

204

analysis, PS-MPs did not exhibit any spectra in the iM DNA's relevant wavenumber range

205

(800-2500 cm-1), suggesting that no spectral changes could be attributed to the binding

206

between PS-MPs and HRAS2 iM DNA. (Fig. S6). However, when PS-MPs were added to

207

HRAS2 iM DNA, noticeable conformational alterations took place. The results reveal that the

208

binding of PS-MPs leads to significant shifts in the peak regions of HRAS2 iM DNA (Fig.

209

4A) at the selected hydration level, whereas no such shifts were observed in the peak

210

positions of duplex DNA (Fig. 4B). Generally, the infrared spectrum of nucleic acids falls

211

between 2500 and 800 cm-1. This range includes spectral bands linked to various structural

212

elements, such as bases, sugar groups, and phosphate stretches (Fig. 4). Due to the exchange

213

of labile protons, water exhibits a strong absorbance around 1,635 cm-1, which necessitates

214

the use of D2O to minimize spectral interference, causing only slight changes in the nucleic

215

acid base modes. However, H2O is used in the 1,300–1,575 cm-1 range, where IR frequencies

216

associated with base-sugar bending modes, sensitive to glycoside torsion angles, are present.

217

In D2O, the 1,800–1,500 cm-1 region predominantly shows base vibrations, including C=C,

218

C=N, and C=O stretching, as well as in-plane vibrations. The IR signals are highly responsive

219

to changes in base stacking, base pairing, solvent interactions, and metal ion binding due to

220

the electron-rich nature of the p-double bonds. Structural and conformational changes can be

221

monitored by observing simultaneous shifts in the spectrum and variations in band intensity

222

[15,16]. The pure PS-MPs samples display prominent characteristic peaks at wavenumbers

223

3026, 2920, 2850 cm−1 (Fig. S6). The peaks at 3026 cm−1 correspond to the aromatic C–H

224

stretching, while the C=C vinyl group is indicated by these peaks. The characteristic peaks at

225

2920 and 2850 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of CH2,

226

respectively [17].

227

The interaction between HRAS2 iM DNA and PS-MPs is evident through several changes

228

in the infrared spectrum of the HRAS2/PS-MPs complex, compared to the individual spectra

229

of HRAS2 and PS-MPs. By analysing the spectral shifts in the HRAS2/PS-MPs complex, we

230

were able to assess the effects of this interaction. These results align with our observations of

231

the binding between HRAS2 iM DNA and PS-MPs, where a downshift in the peak occurs and

232

the phosphate group in the HRAS2 iM DNA backbone is disrupted during the binding. In

233

contrast, fewer changes were observed in the infrared spectrum of the duplex DNA/PS-MPs

complex. This suggests that duplex DNA experiences minimal structural alterations when

235

interacting with PS-MPs. These findings are consistent with our circular dichroism (CD)

236

results, which also indicate changes in secondary conformation of HRAS2 iM in the presence

237

of PS-MPs.

238

Conclusion

239

Pollutants like microplastics (MPs) have the potential to disrupt cellular function and

240

genomic integrity by infiltrating DNA, leading to strand breaks and genetic mutations.

241

Despite ongoing research, identifying the precise binding locations and interaction

242

mechanisms between the functional groups of MPs and DNA remains a significant challenge.

243

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these intricate interactions is essential for

244

uncovering the molecular basis of how environmental pollutants like MPs influence DNA. To

245

date, no studies have conducted to explore the interactions between human alternative non-

246

canonical iM DNA and various MPs. In summary, based on our experimental results, PS-MPs

247

demonstrated a stronger affinity and specificity for HRAS2 iM DNA, leading to noticeable

248

alterations in the spectral profile, including hypochromism and a red shift in the UV-Vis

249

absorption spectrum. CD measurements revealed modifications in the secondary structure

250

intensity of HRAS2 iM DNA, while FT-IR spectroscopy highlighted changes in the

251

conformation of the iM DNA upon binding. Furthermore, thermal melting analysis indicated

252

that the presence of PS-MPs enhanced the thermal stability of HRAS2 iM DNA by

253

approximately 3°C. This provides important insights into the potential toxicity of PS-MPs on

254

HRAS2 iM DNA at an early stage. Given their small size, PS-MPs are capable of penetrating

255

cellular membranes and potentially reaching the nucleus, where they could bind to specific

256

iM DNA structures, posing significant risks to vital biological processes. We believe our

research offers valuable insights into the potential health risks posed by PS-MPs

258

contamination, thereby advancing our understanding of their impact on human health. These

259

results reveal a new aspect of microplastic pollution: their ability to interact with and

260

potentially modify regulatory DNA structures in organisms. By connecting environmental

261

contaminants to molecular-level effects on genetic material, this study enhances our

262

understanding of the chemical interactions and biological consequences of microplastics in

263

ecosystems. It emphasizes the importance of developing comprehensive environmental

264

chemistry models that consider both the physical presence and the chemical reactivity of

265

emerging pollutants.
