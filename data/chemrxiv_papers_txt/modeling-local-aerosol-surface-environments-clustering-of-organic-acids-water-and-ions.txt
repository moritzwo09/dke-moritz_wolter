Abstract
Pyruvic acid is an omnipresent compound in nature and is found both in the gasphase and in the particle-phase of the atmosphere as well as in aqueous solution in the
hydrosphere. Despite much literature on the photochemical degradation and stability
of pyruvic acid in different chemical environments, the study of simultaneous interactions between gas-phase pyruvic acid or similar carboxylic acids with water and ions
is not well-understood. Here, we present a study of micro-hydrated molecular clusters containing pyruvic acid and the structural analogous caboxylic acids lactic acid,
propionic acid, and 2,2-dihydroxypropanoic acid by probing geometries, binding free
energies, hydrate distributions, as well as their IR absorption spectra. We performed a
meticulous configurational sampling protocol for the various hydrated clusters ranging
from low level of theory to high level of theory to identify the lowest free energy structure. We find that cluster geometries and especially their water structure are highly
sensitive to the presence and character of ions. We show that the hydration of the
studied organic acids is thermodynamically unfavorable in the gas-phase and ions are
necessary for mediating interactions between organic acids and water thus stabilizing
the clusters. Finally, we find a clear correlation between decreasing pyruvic acid carboxylic O–H stretching frequencies, increasing intensity when adding more water to
the clusters, and a correlation between increasing red-shifting of the O–H frequencies
upon addition of ions to the clusters. The observations done in this study could pave
the way to unravel the mechanisms behind the transitioning of organic acids from the
gas-phase to the particle phase.

Introduction

The small organic acid, pyruvic acid (PA), and its conjugate base, the pyruvate ion (PA – ),
are common chemical constituents of aerosols, fogs, clouds as well as seawater. 1,2 PA is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and emitted from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources and has
been detected as a major component of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) at many geographic
locations. 3,4 These include the urban atmospheres of Japan, 5 China, 6–8 and Mongolia 9 but
PA has also been detected in remote aerosols at mountaintops in China, 3 tropic Indian
aerosols, 10 marine aerosols, 11–13 arctic aerosols, 14 and even in biomass burning aerosols in
Brazil. 15 The particle-phase concentration of PA has been observed to possess a large spatiotemporal variability with average particle-phase concentrations measured as high as 49.7
ng m-3 in SOA of the urban atmosphere of Tokyo, Japan and as low as 0.03 ng m-3 in marine
aerosols over the Southern Ocean. 5,12 Furthermore, particle-phase concentrations of PA are
observed to fluctuate significantly depending on season. 4,5
In the aqueous phase, PA has been subjected to many photochemical investigations
and has been reported to produce acetoin, lactic acid, and acetic acid and possibly also
contribute to SOA mass through an oligomerization process, which goes via the parapyruvic
acid dimer. 16–20 Furthermore, PA has been found to exist as a mixture of the keto form and
its hydrate, the geminal diol 2,2-dihydroxypropanoic acid (termed diol in this study). 20,21
Hence, PA interconverts between the diol, the conjugate base of the diol, and the conjugate
base of PA, PA – , in a cyclic manner. 20 The ratio of abundances of the keto form and the diol
has previously been reported to be 65% diol and 35% keto in aqueous solution, at 298 K and
neutral pH. 16,20,22 Furthermore, the pKa of PA in its keto form in aqueous solution and at
298 K is determined to be 2.18 while for the diol, it is determined to be 3.6. 20 In perspective,
aerosols are usually acidic with a median pH of 2.5, which implies that PA in its keto form is
the most favored in aerosols at normal ambient conditions. 23 In addition to the pure aqueousphase studies of PA, there has also been conducted several photochemical experiments of PA
in e.g. multiphase environments and at air-water interfaces in order to probe the dynamic

equilibrium between PA in the aqueous phase and PA in the gas-phase. 24,25
PA has also been studied extensively in the gas-phase. 2,26–30 The gas-phase mixing ratio
of PA has mainly been measured in the range 10-100 pptv but has been detected as high as
400 pptv in the Amazonas region of Brazil and in the southern US. 2,27,30 The atmospheric
sources of PA in the troposphere are manifold and the routes to its formation goes mainly
through gas-phase photolysis of small organic precursors. This includes the photo-oxidation
of isoprene via the ozonolysis of methyl vinyl ketone, 31–33 the photolysis of methylglyoxal, 34
the reactions of peroxy radicals formed in the oxidation of propane, acetone, and hydroxyacetone, 35,36 and in the photo-oxidation of aromatic compounds in the presence of NOx . 37,38 The
atmospheric sinks of PA, on the other hand, are generally four-fold: i) By rapid gas-phase
photolysis induced by actinic radiation; 39 ii) by slow gas-phase reaction with OH radicals; 2
by wet and dry deposition, and iv) by partitioning into the aerosol particle-phase. 16–18,40–43
The atmospheric fate of PA via photolysis proceeds primarily via an exothermic decarboxylation, which involves a five-membered transition state that decomposes into CO2 and
methylhydroxycarbene with the latter rapidly rearranging to acetaldehyde. 2,30 The gas-phase
lifetime of PA with respect to the photolysis channel is a few hours according to previous
experimental studies. 44,45 Conversely, the gas-phase lifetime of PA against the OH channel is
significantly longer at about three months. 46 The atmospheric fate of PA via the dry and wet
deposition mechanisms as well as by the partitioning into the aerosol-phase are particularly
pronounced at high relative humidity due to the high solubility of PA in water and can thus
contribute to the formation of SOA. 16–18,40–43
While the gas-phase and aqueous phase chemistry of PA has been extensively studied,
the transition between the two has not yet been investigated in detail. The uptake of PA
onto aerosol particles must occur via the interfacial surface layer. As a first approximation
the local environment of the interaction between the gas phase PA and the surface can be
viewed as a small cluster of molecules consisting of water and ions. Despite previous studies
on the PA monohydrate cluster, the diol in the liquid phase 21 and the PA clusters with one

to four water molecules, 47 there has, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported any
studies on how PA or similar carboxylic acids simultaneously interact with water molecules
and ions.
In this study, we investigate clusters of PA and its structurally similar analogs, lactic
acid (LA), propionic acid (ProA), and 2,2-dihydroxypropionic acid (diol), by probing the
geometries, computing cluster binding free energies, hydrate distributions, and IR absorption
spectra. We specifically look at the intermolecular interactions between the organic acids,
water and ions (Na+ , Cl – and a NaCl pair). By viewing such clusters as a representation of
the local aerosol surface environment, our aim is to elucidate how such small organic acids
interact with the surface and enters the particle.

Computational Details

Initial configurational sampling was performed with ABCluster program version 2.0, using a
CHARMM force field. 48,49 Subsequent single-point energies, geometries, and configurational
sampling were calculated employing the GFN1-xTB method 50 in the xtb software versions
6.4.0 and 6.4.1. 51 Gaussian 16 version B.01 was utilized for the DFT geometry optimizations
and vibrational frequency calculations at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. 52
ORCA version 5.0.4 was employed for calculating high level single-point energies using the
DLPNO-CCSD(T0 )/aug-cc-pVTZ level. 53 The DLPNO-CCSD(T0 )/aug-cc-pVTZ//ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory has been used extensively in the literature 54–61 for studying
the binding energetics of atmospheric molecular clusters and the choice is corroborated by
additional benchmarking of the PA structures and interaction energies, carried out in this
work (see Supporting Information). The above software was used as third-party programs
implemented in the JKCS program, which fully automate the cluster configurational sampling. 62

Cluster Systems

We studied the (PA)1 (w)0−5 , (LA)1 (w)0−5 , (ProA)1 (w)0−5 , (diol)1 (w)0−5 , (PA)1 (Na+ )0−1 (Cl – )0−1 (w)0−5 ,
(PA – )1 (w)0−5 and the (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )0−1 (w)0−5 cluster systems. Figure 1B below presents
the four different conformers of PA. 63 The PA conformers are conventionally assigned conformational abbreviations according to the cis-trans nomenclature, with the first letter denoting
the geometric relationship between the two carbonyl groups and the second letter denoting
the geometric relationship between the α-carbonyl group and the carboxylic acid proton. 63
Blair et al. calculated the relative zero-point vibrational corrected electronic energies of the
four PA conformers to be 0.00 kcal/mol for the Tc conformer, 2.68 kcal/mol for the Tt
conformer, 4.36 kcal/mol for the Ct conformer, and 10.31 kcal/mol for the Cc conformer at
298 K and at the ωB97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. 63

Configurational Sampling

We employed a well-established, extensive configurational sampling (CS) protocol to obtain
the cluster structures. The ABCluster input files for PA, LA, ProA, and the diol were generated with topgen. 65 Hirshfeld population analysis was calculated at the MP2/6-31++G(d,p)
level of theory. 66 We used the Charge Model 5 (CM5), which has a reduced basis set sensitivity and geometry dependency. 67 The overall configurational sampling workflow can be
described as follows:

The ABCluster search was performed based on the parameters recommended by Kubečka
et al., with a population of SN = 300 times the number of molecules in the cluster, number
of generations gmax = 200, and a maximal structure lifetime of sc = 4 generations for all
cluster sizes. 68 All protonation states of water (H2 O, H3 O+ , and OH – ) leading to electrical
neutral clusters and all conformers of PA, LA, ProA, and the diol were employed in the
ABCluster search. The overall number of local minima saved for subsequent GFN1-xTB
calculations was 2000 (lm = 2000/N S, where N S refers to the total number of simulations)
and were sorted with respect to electronic energy.
The selected structures were pre-optimized at the GFN1-xTB level. 50 After the preoptimization, a filtering maneuver was performed with respect to the collective variables:
Electronic energy (0.001 Ha cut-off), radius of gyration (0.01 Å cut-off), and electric dipole
moment (0.1 D cut-off) to identify unique configurations.
After filtering, full geometry optimization and vibrational frequency calculations were
performed at ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. 52 Structures where the lowest vibrational frequencies were negative and structures, which did not converge were resubmitted for
further optimization. After all DFT calculations were finished, the quasi-harmonic approx-

imation were applied using a frequency cut-off at 100 cm−1 . 69,70 All frequencies below this
cut-off are treated as free rotations when calculating the entropy. Finally, single-point electronic energies were calculated with the DLPNO-CCSD(T0 ) method on the five structures
lowest in Gibbs free energy. 71,72 For these calculations, the RI-JK approximation with the
aug-cc-pVTZbasis set, and with an auxiliary basis set for the Coulomb and exchange parts
was applied together with the TightSCF convergence criterion.

2.2.1

Calculations of Binding Free Energies

The binding free energy (∆Gbind ) of the clusters is defined as:

∆Gbind = Gcluster − (Gmonomer + n ⋅ Gwater + m ⋅ Gions/salt ),

(1)

where Gmonomer corresponds to the Gibbs free energy of the organic acid monomer, Gwater
corresponds to the Gibbs free energy of a water molecule, Gions/salt corresponds to the Gibbs
free energy of the Na+ or Cl – ion or the NaCl pair, and n and m correspond to the number
of water molecules and the number of ions in the cluster, respectively. We calculate the
Gibbs free energy for each cluster component as a combination of a high-level electronic
contribution and a DFT thermal free correction:

GDLPNO-CCSD(T)//ωB97X-D = Ecorr

DLPNO-CCSD(T)

+ GωB97X-D

(2)

Here the free energies are computed at 298.15 K and 1 atm. Free energies at other
temperatures are calculated based on the assumption that the enthalpy and entropy does
not change significantly when changing the temperature.
For the hydration distributions presented in this study, we apply the following equation
obtained from statistical mechanics and classical nucleation theory:

IR Absorptions of Pyruvic Acid Clusters

Multiple experimental studies have been reported on the H-shift for the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carboxylic O–H bond and the α-carbonyl group of PA. 28,29 Thus,
vibrational spectroscopy has been an important tool in distinguishing between the various
conformers of PA.
In order to computationally probe the hydrogen bond shift of the PA carboxylic O–
H bond in the clusters, we calculated IR spectra of the various PA-containing clusters.
GaussView version 6.0.16 73 was employed for visually inspecting the vibrational normal
modes of the clusters and identifying the relevant carboxylic O–H stretching vibration. The
discrete vibrational modes for the global minimum structure of each cluster corresponding to
the carboxylic O–H stretching vibration were then collected and presented as an IR spectrum.

The Reference Systems

To test our configurational sampling methodology, we initially studied the simple (w)0−5 ,
(Na+ )1 (w)0−5 , and (Cl – )0−1 (w)0−5 cluster systems. We obtained the cluster structures shown
in Figure 2. The clusters are calculated at the DLPNO-CCSD(T0 )/aug-cc-pVTZ//ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, at 298.15 K and 1 atm using the quasi-harmonic approximation.

Multiple experimental studies have reported the gas-phase micro-hydration of the sodium
ion 74–80 along with computational investigations. 81–101 In a similar manner the micro-hydration
of the chloride ion has also been studied experimentally, 80,102,103 in addition to computational

investigations. 83,84,87,88,97,103–105 Generally, we see high similarity between our geometries obtained at the ωB97X-D/6-31++g(d,p) level of theory and literature geometries obtained at
the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory for the hydrated gas-phase clusters of a sodium ion 101
and a chloride ion. 97 In a similar manner our identified (w)1−5 cluster geometries seen in
Figure 2A follow the conventional structure of pure gas-phase water clusters reported in the
literature. 106–108
Figure 2B shows the (Na+ )1 (w)1−5 cluster geometries. For (Na+ )1 (w)1 , we observe an
ion-dipole interaction. For (Na+ )1 (w)2 , we wee a linear assembly of water molecules with
the Na+ center. For (Na+ )1 (w)3 , the cluster adopts a trigonal planar geometry of the waters
surrounding the Na+ center. For the (Na+ )1 (w)4 cluster, a quasi-square planar geometry
is seen, due to the additional water molecule (confirmed with literature geometries 88,91,101 )
but is also reported to be able to adopt a tetrahedral geometry. 88,91,101 For (Na+ )1 (w)5 ,
four water molecules are interacting with Na+ and one water resides at the periphery of the
cluster, which corresponds to the most reported literature geometries even though square
pyramidal geometries also occur. 88,91,101
Figure 2C presents the (Cl – )1 (w)1−5 cluster geometries. For (Cl – )1 (w)1 , we observe a
polarization-enhanced hydrogen bond. For (Cl – )1 (w)2 , we see a trigonal planar geometry
of all components without an ionic center (in contrast to the (Na+ )1 (w)3 cluster described
above). For (Cl – )1 (w)3 , the cluster adopts a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the central Cl – . For the (Cl – )1 (w)4 cluster, a square pyramidal geometry around the central Cl – is
seen. For (Cl – )1 (w)5 , a quasi-square pyramidal geometry around the central Cl – is observed,
which possess a slight deviation from the four-water planarity observed in the (Cl – )1 (w)4
cluster. In general, the (Cl – )1 (w)1−5 clusters are also in full agreement with literature geometries. 97,103,105
Overall, Na+ is generally observed to be encapsulated inside the clusters and solvated
by the surrounding water molecules. In contrast the Cl – ion is residing at the edge of the
clusters.

The Hydration of Organic Acids

Using the outlined configurational sampling protocol we studied the (PA)1 (w)0−5 , (LA)1 (w)0−5 ,
(ProA)1 (w)0−5 , and (diol)1 (w)0−5 cluster systems. Figure 3 presents the hydrated cluster
geometries of PA (Figure 3A), LA (Figure 3B), ProA (Figure 3C), and the diol (Figure 3D). All calculations are performed at the DLPNO-CCSD(T0 )/aug-cc-pVTZ//ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, at 298.15 K and 1 atm.

298.15 K and 1 atm using the quasi-harmonic approximation. Hydrogen atoms are white,
carbon brown, and oxygen red.

In no cases do we observe a proton transfer from the organic acids to water. As seen in
Figure 3A, the Tc conformer of PA was identified as the lowest free energy conformer, as
expected. However, when hydrating the monomer, it takes the form of the Tt conformer
within the (PA)1 (w)1−3 and (PA)1 (w)5 clusters. This can be ascribed to the PA monomer
engaging in favorable hydrogen-bonding interactions with the surrounding water molecules

thus impeding intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic O–H donor and the
α-carbonyl acceptor. In the (PA)1 (w)4 cluster, the Ct conformer of PA is observed instead
but the configuration of the carboxylic acid moiety is retained as the Ct conformer is simply
generated by a 180-degree rotation around the C–C bond of the two carbonyl groups of the
Tc conformer. Generally, the water molecules are observed to reside at the carboxylic acid
terminus of the PA monomer and the hydrogen bonding capacity of the carboxylic oxygens
are observed to be saturated at the (PA)1 (w)4 cluster, i.e., the fifth water molecule in the
(PA)1 (w)5 cluster engages in hydrogen bonding with the α-carbonyl group instead, thus
serving as a water bridge to the adjacent four-water ensemble.
When comparing the PA clusters with literature, we find that the (PA)1 (w)1 cluster is
consistent with the cluster obtained by Petersen-Sonn et al. 47 at CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ
level of theory and by Shemesh et al. 109 at MP2/cc-pVDZ level of theory. However, for the
(PA)1 (w)2−5 clusters we find slight discrepancies between our geometries and the literature
geometries as the water structure here is much more diffuse compared to our well-centered
and well-organized water structure. These geometric discrepancies could be ascribed to both
differences in configurational sampling protocol and level of theory.
In case of the PA analogs in Figure 3B-D, we observe very similar geometrical patterns as
for the PA clusters in Figure 3A. For the (LA)1 (w)0−5 clusters, the SsC conformer of LA 64 is
the lowest free energy conformer across all clusters due to the intramolecular hydrogen bond
between the α-hydroxy group and the carboxylic carbonyl group as well as the minimization
of steric repulsions induced by the methyl group as it protrudes away from the carboxylic acid
plane of LA. For the (ProA)1 (w)0−5 clusters, ProA takes the planar and entirely staggered
conformer over the bent conformer across all clusters. For the (diol)1 (w)0−5 clusters, the Ct
conformer dominates across all clusters due to the intramolecular hydrogen bond between
the carboxylic carbonyl group and one of the α-hydroxy groups while the other α-hydroxy
group and the methyl group protrude away from the main carboxylic acid plane of the diol.
Generally for all organic acid clusters containing four water molecules in Figure 3, we

observe a conservation of the water structure with respect to the pure water cluster containing
four water molecules presented in Figure 2A above.
3.1.3

The Pyruvic Acid-Containing Clusters

We studied the (PA)1 (Na+ )0−1 (Cl – )0−1 (w)0−5 cluster systems to investigate the influence of
ions on the PA-containing clusters. Figure 4 shows clusters with sodium ion, with chloride
ion, and with both ions simultaneously.

carbon brown, oxygen red, and sodium gray, and chlorine green.
Generally, we observe no proton transfers in these clusters. For the (PA)1 (Na+ )1−5 clusters
in Figure 4A, PA prefers the Ct conformer. This can be ascribed to the bifurcated ion-dipole
interactions between the adjacent carbonyl oxygens of PA and Na+ . The water molecules are
generally observed to reside on the other side of Na+ for the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)1−4 clusters thus
building up a hydrogen-bonded water network solely interacting with the Na+ ion. However,

for the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)5 cluster, we observe that the Na+ ion is “solvated” by the water
molecules, thus residing more remotely from the PA monomer.
Upon visual inspection of the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 in Figure 4B, we observe a much broader
variation in the preferred PA conformer across the hydrated clusters. PA prefers the Cc
conformer in the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 dimer cluster. For the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)1 cluster, the C–C bond
rotation between the carbonyl groups of PA has occurred and the Tc conformer is now
preferred. The relative geometry between the carboxylic O–H and the α-carbonyl group is
not completely planar as it is in the ordinary Tc conformer, which can be ascribed to better
steric access of Cl – and the water molecule to engage in hydrogen bond interactions with
the carboxylic O–H and the α-carbonyl group, respectively. In the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)2 cluster,
the C–C bond has rotated further, and thus PA adopts the Ct form thereby interacting
with Cl – through the carboxylic O–H and water through the carboxylic carbonyl group.
For the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)3−4 clusters, the C–C bond is rotated such that PA is effectively a
superposition between the Tc and Cc conformers. Finally, in the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)5 cluster,
we observe the Tt conformer to be the preferred PA conformer. Here, we observe the water
molecules to have formed a hydrogen bonding network encapsulating the Cl – thus screening
Cl – from forming hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic O–H.
For the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters in Figure 4C, the Ct conformer is the preferred
form across all clusters. The Cl – ion engages in hydrogen bonding with the carboxylic O–H
in (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−4 , while it is encapsulated by water and screened from interacting
in (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)5 . Generally across the clusters, we see that the Na+ ion and the
Cl – ion reside in close proximity to each other and form an ion pair, which interacts with
the carboxylic O–H group and the carbonyl group of the PA monomer. However, these
interactions are mitigated when more water is added to the clusters. We also observe a
general ion solvation point when reaching five waters in the various hydrated clusters where
the ion is encapsulated and isolated from the PA monomer by the nascent water hydrogen
bonding network.

Overall, introducing ions into the system, highly perturbs the cluster geometries.

The Pyruvate-Containing Clusters

To study the conjugate base of PA, the pyruvate ion, we investigated the (PA – )1 (w)0−5 and
(PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )0−1 (w)0−5 cluster systems. Figure 5 presents the structures of the studied systems, calculated at the DLPNO-CCSD(T0 )/aug-cc-pVTZ//ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p)
level of theory, at 298.15 K and 1 atm using the quasi-harmonic approximation.

green.

Generally, across all clusters in Figure 5, we observe no proton transfers from water to the
PA – monomer. For the (PA – )1 (w)0−5 clusters in Figure 5A, we observed a nascent water
hydrogen bonding network forming at the carboxylate terminus of PA – analogous to our
findings for the (PA)1 (w)0−5 clusters above.

Upon comparison of the PA – clusters with literature, we see that both the (PA – )1 (w)1
and (PA – )1 (w)2 clusters are consistent with the clusters obtained by Petersen-Sonn et al. 47
obtained at CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory and the clusters obtained by Shemesh
et al. 109 at MP2/cc-pVDZ level of theory. As for the PA clusters examined previously, we
observe discrepancies between our (PA – )1 (w)3−5 cluster geometries and literature geometries
due to the dispersed water structure in these and as the water structure in our geometries
are well-ordered and mainly located at the carboxylate terminus of PA – .
Upon adding Na+ to the system in the (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 clusters of Figure 5B,
we see that the Na+ ion preferably interact with the two carbonyl groups instead of the
carboxylate group. For the hydrated clusters, the Na+ ion is seen to bridge the water
molecules and the pyruvate ion. This is a similar interaction pattern as observed in the
(PA)1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters of Figure 4C.
For the (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters in Figure 5C, we generally observe Na+ to
reside closer to the PA – monomer where it engages in linear or bifurcated salt bridges with
the carboxylate moiety of PA – . Cl – is not observed to engage in hydrogen bonds with water
or PA – in the lower hydrated (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 and (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)1 clusters due
to Coulomb repulsions. However, as more water is added, it becomes increasingly involved
in the nascent water hydrogen bonding networks of the higher hydrated clusters. Na+ is, in
this regard, becoming more encapsulated and solvated by the surrounding water, which we
also observed for the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters as described above.

Cluster Binding Free Energies and hydrate distributions

After analyzing the cluster geometries, we progress to probe the binding free energies and
hydrate distributions. All calculations are performed at the DLPNO-CCSD(T0 )/aug-ccpVTZ//ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, at 298.15 K and 1 atm using the quasiharmonic approximation.

3.2.1

The Hydration of Organic Acids

The left panel of Figure 6 presents the gas-phase binding free energy profiles of PA and its
various analogs: LA, ProA, and diol. The binding free energies are plotted as a function of
“added water molecules”, such that each point has the same total number of molecules in
the cluster. Hence, zero is the monomer of either the organic acids or a water molecule.

clusters at the given level of theory included as a black dashed line. Right: Equilibrium
hydrate distributions of the various organic acids and the water reference at 298.15 K and

All binding free energies are positive and increase with the number of water molecules in
the cluster. This entails that the clusters become increasingly more thermodynamically unfavorable and thus increasingly unstable in the gas-phase when adding more water molecules.
This is most pronounced for the (PA)1 (w)0−5 clusters as they are observed to be close to or
even higher in free energy compared to the pure gas-phase water clusters. The higher free
energy is caused by the internal H-bond present in the PA monomer. Hence, to form clusters
with water, PA needs to break the internal H-bond, which thereby does not lead to a gain
in free energy.
The first hydration steps of LA, ProA, and diol is more favorable compared to PA. In
addition, the binding free energies are very similar for the addition of the first four water
molecules. However, the addition of the fifth water molecule is significantly more favorable
for the diol compared to LA and ProA. This can be rationalized from the structures in
Figure 3, where the diol is interacting with all five water molecules in the extended H-bond
network, while LA and ProA primarily interact with four water molecules and have the fifth
water molecule only interacting with other water molecules and not the acids.
The right panel of Figure 6 presents the hydrate distributions of the organic acids. All
the organic acids are observed to be non-hydrated in the gas-phase. Hydrate distributions
obtained at 273.15 K and 258.15 K and at 50% relative humidity does not change this
conclusion (see Supporting Information).
The fact that the clusters do not interact favorably with up to five water molecules could
indicate that more water molecules are needed to describe how small chain organic acids
enter an aerosol particle. Alternatively, this could also indicate that an aqueous surface
should potentially include ions to thermodynamically stabilize the clusters.

The Pyruvic Acid-Containing Clusters

included as a black dotted and a black dashdotted line, respectively. Right: Equilibrium
hydrate distributions of the various clusters at 298.15 K and 1 atm and at 100% relative

The binding free energy profiles of the PA clusters containing Na+ and Cl – ions were investigated. The left panel of Figure 7 presents the gas-phase binding free energies of PA with Na+
and Cl – . In contrast to the positive binding free energies of the hydrated clusters containing
PA, LA, ProA, and diol as discussed above, we generally observe the hydrated PA clusters
containing ions to be thermodynamically favorable. Especially the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 and
the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters are seen to decrease markedly at smaller water content
and then flatten out at larger water content. This indicates that the stabilizing effect is diminishing with increasing water content. On the other hand, the (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters
are observed to be relatively constant, just below zero in normalized binding free energy,

which indicates that Cl – is not able to thermodynamically stabilize the hydrated clusters in
the gas-phase as favorably as the hydrated clusters containing Na+ . Generally, the hydration
of the pyruvic acid-containing clusters in the presence of ions is negative and thus the ions
may compensate for the lack of binding observed in the pure PA–water clusters. In the case
of (PA)1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 , the binding free energy is nearly zero as the negative free energy of
the (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters cancel with the positive free energy of the (PA)1 (w)0−5 clusters. In
the case of the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 clusters, the presence of the Na+ ion still leads to a low
free energy.
The right panel of Figure 7 presents the hydrate distributions of the pyruvic acidcontaining clusters. Generally, we observe the highly hydrated clusters to be favored when
the binding free energy is very negative and we observe the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 clusters to
favor hydration the most. Similar conclusion is reached when studying the hydrate distributions obtained at 273.15 K and 258.15 K and at 50% relative humidity (available in the
Supporting Information).
Generally, when comparing the binding free energy analysis and the hydrate distributions with the cluster geometry analysis in the previous section, it is clear that Na+ ions
stabilize the PA clusters the most and the stabilization is less pronounced for the Cl – ion.
Furthermore, a significant degree of solvation of the Na+ ion by water in the gas-phase is
also thermodynamically favorable for stabilizing the clusters.

Equilibrium hydrate distributions of the various clusters at 298.15 K and 1 atm and at

Deprotonation of PA leading to PA – could lead to more stable clusters. The left panel
of Figure 8 presents the binding free energies normalized to the dry clusters of PA – with
Na+ and Cl – . Generally, the hydration profiles are similar to the PA-containing clusters
described above. We observe the energies of the (PA – )1 (w)0−5 , (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 and
(PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 to decrease with increasing water content. This leads to negative
binding free energies in all cases. Hence, pyruvate hydration is favorable and, in general,
seems to be enhanced by other ions.
The right panel of Figure 8 presents the hydrate distributions of the pyruvate-containing
clusters. In all cases, the clusters are highly hydrated with 2–5 water molecules. The
(PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (Cl – )1 (w)0−5 clusters are found to be slightly more hydrated than the corresponding (PA – )1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 clusters. This could indicate that Cl – exhibits a synergistic

effect with Na+ in thermodynamically stabilizing the higher hydrated clusters. Hydrate distributions obtained at 273.15 K and 258.15 K and at 50% relative humidity show similar
trends (see Supporting Information).
Overall, we find that ions are very important for the interaction between the PA monomer
and water as well as between the PA – monomer and water addressed here. Hence, for
organics to efficiently partition to the particle-phase some surface ions should most likely be
present.

3.3

IR Absorption

Gas-phase measurements of hydrated clusters are extremely difficult to carry out. One
promising technique to identify weakly bound clusters is to probe the H-shift of the O–H
stretch upon cluster formation. This methodology has been applied to detect clusters such
as the gas-phase PA monomer, 63 the gas-phase dimethylamine monomer, 110 and the gasphase methanol–dimethylamine dimer 111 where the N–H stretch is contributing to cluster
formation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies on the
IR absorptions of hydrated PA clusters in the gas-phase. Here we provide such analysis
to potentially guide future experiments. The IR spectra presented in this section were
obtained at ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. We stress that the choice of method
is qualitatively sufficient for the following analysis. I.e. the peaks in the IR spectra are
likely shifted compared experimental values, but the overall relative peak positions should
accurate.

Figure 9 presents the IR O–H frequencies and intensities of the hydrated gas-phase PA
clusters with the corresponding cluster geometries. Generally, we see a trend of decreasing
O–H frequency (red-shift) and increasing intensity with increasing cluster water content.
As the PA monomer is found not to be hydrated in the gas-phase a strong red-shift from
3725 cm−1 in an experiment could indicate that the PA monomer is interacting with one or
more water molecules. This streching frequency mode for the gas-phase PA monomer is also
in fairly good agreement with previously reported experimental work. 63

Figure 10 presents the IR O–H frequencies and intensities of the hydrated gas-phase PA

observe a more mixed pattern in O–H frequencies with respect to cluster water content. The
difference in intensities in the spectrum can be attributed to the presence of water at the
O–H bond, as seen in the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)4 and (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)5 clusters, with red-shifts of
532 cm−1 and 555 cm−1 compared to the PA monomer, respectively. The remaining clusters
do not have water present at the O–H bond, which leads to an O–H stretching frequency
similar to the isolated PA monomer.

with Cl – . We generally observe the O–H frequency pattern with respect to water content
to be even more mixed here than for the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5 clusters. The O–H stretching
frequency is significantly red-shifted (by up to 1435 cm−1 ) compared to the PA monomer
in all cases. This is caused by the strong interaction between the Cl – ion and the O–H
group. Hence, a very strong red-shift in the IR-spectrum could indicate the presence of a
tight ion-pair with chloride ion.

Figure 12 shows the IR intensities as a function of IR O–H frequencies of the hydrated
gas-phase clusters with Na+ and Cl – . All the clusters are red-shifted by up to 867 cm−1
compared to the PA monomer. In addition, we observe the O–H frequencies to increase with
increasing water content while the intensities decrease. This is in contrast to the hydrated
PA clusters with no ions present.
To summarize the above IR analyses of the various systems, we can corroborate the
correlation between decreasing O–H frequency and increasing intensity with increasing water
content of the clusters, which is gradually reversed when adding ions to the system. Finally,
we see a propensity toward red-shifting of the O–H vibrational frequencies when adding more
ions to the hydrated PA clusters even though the O–H frequencies in the (PA)1 (Na+ )1 (w)0−5
clusters resonate consistently above 3000 cm−1 .

Conclusions

Here we have studied the molecular interaction between organic acids, water and ions at
a mimic aerosol surface. In our study of the cluster geometries of the reference systems
comprised of pure water, hydrated Na+ , and hydrated Cl – , we find that all are in full
agreement with literature. This illustrates the applicability of the applied computational
approach.
For the cluster geometries of hydrated pyruvate and organic acids (including pyruvic
acid), we show that for all clusters containing one to four water molecules, a complete
conservation of the water network structure with respect to the pure water cluster is preserved. However, upon introduction of ions into the pyruvic acid-containing clusters and
pyruvate-containing clusters, we show that the water structure of the clusters are perturbed
significantly compared to the organic acid clusters without ions and the reference systems.
In our investigation of the cluster binding free energies and hydrate distributions, we find
that the organic acids PA, LA, ProA, and diol are not hydrated in the gas-phase. On the
other hand, we find that the pyruvic-acid containing clusters and the pyruvate-containing
clusters with ions present are significantly more thermodynamically stabilized in the gasphase with the Na+ ion contributing the most to this stabilization. This suggests that
for organic acids, to efficiently transition from the gas-phase to the particle-phase, some
interfacial surface ions should possibly be present to facilitate the process.
As a part of the IR absorption studies of the various pyruvic-acid containing clusters,
we find a correlation between decreasing O–H frequency and increasing intensity when more
water is added to the clusters. Furthermore, we observe a correlation between increasing
red-shift of the O–H frequencies upon addition of ions to the clusters indicating strong
interactions between the PA monomer and the surrounding water and ions.
In the following work to this study, we will investigate the same systems in the aqueous
phase and at aerosol surfaces to probe the cluster geometries and stabilities when changing
the chemical environment. Thereby we can fully unravel the mechanisms, which leads to
