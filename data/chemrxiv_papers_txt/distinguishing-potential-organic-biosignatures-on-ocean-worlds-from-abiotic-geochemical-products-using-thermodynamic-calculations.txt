Organic compounds have been detected all over the solar system – from
meteorites (Burton et al., 2018; Cronin, 1989; Cronin and Pizzarello, 1983; Elsila et al.,
2016; Epstein et al., 1987; Koga et al., 2017; Martins et al., 2008), comets (Mumma and
Charnley, 2011), asteroids (De Sanctis et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2024), other planets
(Freissinet et al., 2015), and icy moons (Postberg et al., 2008; Waite et al., 2009). In all
these cases, the presence of organic molecules is not evidence of life since organic
molecules can form abiotically, even on Earth (McDermott et al., 2015). Nevertheless,
mass spectrometers are sent across the solar system to detect organic matter in the
search for biosignatures. Doing so requires that we have a clear conception of how to
identify a true biosignature. Thus far, there is no consensus method for classifying organic
material as biotically sourced or abiotically sourced, and some current ideas are
discussed below. As an example, monomeric and oligomeric organic compounds were
assigned a medium to high confidence as a biosignature on NASA’s Ladder of Life
Detection (Neveu et al., 2018), while noting that there are sometimes abiotic synthesis
pathways. With such uncertainty regarding the origin of organic compounds, there is a
need for a process for sorting organic molecules into biotic and abiotic categories, which
will be specific to each environment. The purpose of this study is to create a tool for
discerning potential biosignatures using reaction thermodynamics.

Results from experiments on biotically and abiotically sourced organic molecules
are used in proposed biosignature classification methods. One Enceladus analogue study
compared how ratios of abiotically sourced amino and fatty acids and biologically selected
ratios of amino and fatty acids were preserved after impact ionization of ice grains
(Klenner et al., 2020). The results demonstrated that input ratios were conserved, thus
allowing the discrimination of abiotic and biotic signatures. A limitation with this technique
is that the interpretation of the source of the organics relies on what we know about
biology on Earth. Another intriguing idea for biosignature classification is that of assembly
theory (Marshall et al., 2021), which poses that only biotically sourced organic material
can reach a certain level of complexity, and that complexity can be quantified. Assembly
theory provides a lower threshold for molecular complexity based on life as we know it
but does not address the thermodynamic potential for a molecule to be produced in its
environment. In this study, we explore how the geochemical context of an organic
molecule is crucial for interpretations of its synthetic origins. One way to investigate the
origin of such compounds is by doing thermodynamic calculations for formation reactions
from environmental precursors. Using thermodynamic calculations paired with other

Life as we know it uses the same set of elements to build biomolecules. The bulk
of biomass is comprised of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur,
sometimes referred to as the CHNOPS elements. These elements, along with an energy
source, are criteria that we can imagine extraterrestrial life requiring. Chemotrophs are
organisms that capture energy without sunlight, using chemical disequilibria alone to fuel
biochemical reactions. On ocean worlds such as Enceladus, the search for life would
occur under the icy shell, in the subsurface ocean, where the sun does not reach. There,
chemical disequilibria must provide energy for microorganisms. From CHNOPScontaining precursor molecules, we can evaluate the potential for organic synthesis via
chemotrophy under the ice shell. We can investigate the thermodynamics of organic
synthesis using CHNOPS species in the plume gas as reactants by calculating reaction
affinities. Affinity is a measure of how far from equilibrium a reaction is. If a reaction has
a positive affinity, it is thermodynamically favorable. If it has a negative affinity, the reaction
is unfavorable but is favorable in the reverse direction. While catabolic, energy-releasing
reactions may not be directly coupled to anabolic, biosynthesis reactions, the overall
process must be energetically favorable. An intermediate step familiar from life on Earth
is the storage of energy in adenosine triphosphate, commonly referred to as ATP. Despite
intermediate reactions occurring in microbial metabolism linked by ATP, the overall
reactions are sufficient for understanding the total change in energy, since this is a pathindependent variable.

To quantify the affinity for a compound’s synthesis, a decision must be made
regarding the reactants. Perhaps there is a limited number of options to choose from for
a given environment. If there is only one source of carbon, it may be the source for any
coexisting organics. This decision becomes complicated when there are several options
for reactants, and it is prudent to consider them all. While comparing reaction affinities for
organic synthesis from different reactants, it is possible that the interpretation of their
origin changes. If we do not test all options, we may incorrectly believe something is a
potential biosignature. There is not a one-size-fits-all for biosignatures and the
geochemical context should always be considered. The method presented here provides
a new framework for interpreting the presence of organic molecules that may in the future
be detected on ocean worlds. Any such method for interpreting biosignatures should be
used in conjunction with other biosignature classification frameworks. Especially in the
absence of authentic examples of biosignatures beyond Earth, many lines of evidence
should be gathered and tested. Given the existence of necessary data, Saturn’s moon
Enceladus is used as an example of this general method.

2. METHODS
The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA)
aboard the Cassini spacecraft detected several compounds in the plumes erupting from
the cracks in the icy shell on Enceladus, often referred to as tiger stripes (Khawaja et al.,

2019; Postberg et al., 2023; Waite et al., 2009, 2017). Among the collected data, there
was evidence for each of the CHNOPS elements. Recent analyses of Cassini’s INMS
data by Peter et al. (2023) include a statistically rigorous approach based on information
theory in which previously unidentified species were brought forth as likely components
of the plume gas and the confidence of each species was noted. Values from Peter et al.,
(2023), with constrained errors and statistical probabilities over 70%, were selected for
the present study. The minimum and maximum volume mixing ratios (VMRs) –
representing a percentage of the plume gas – of each species used in this study are
displayed in Table 1. The values for several of these species are supported by evidence
from Cassini’s Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) (Hansen at el., 2020), including
CO, NH3 and CO2. Peter et al. (2023) did not offer a new analysis of the abundance of
H2, citing its in-depth investigation by Waite et al. (2017), which was also adopted in this
study. H2S was not confidently constrained by Peter et al. (2023), with a value of <0.003%
of the plume and a probability of 37%. Therefore, we adopted the value from Waite et al.
(2009) – 0.0021% ± 0.001%, while acknowledging that this species is considered highly
ambiguous (Magee & Waite, 2017). These numbers are in relative agreement and are
used to calculate hypothetical affinities, so we accepted this uncertainty. Additionally,
since sulfur is a minor component in most biomolecules, changes in this value are unlikely
to strongly affect affinity results. To maintain consistency in this study, we are only using
abundances determined by extrapolating data collected from INMS.

Using the ranges of CO2 detected by the INMS, observed temperatures of the tiger
stripes (Goguen et al., 2012), and saturation vapor pressures of ice at relevant
temperatures (Haynes, 2014), the log activities of CO2 in the subsurface ocean were
constrained to a range of -5.9 and -2.8 by Glein et al. (2020). In the present study, we use
the same method to constrain the aqueous activities of several species quantified by
INMS. The CO2 activity in the ocean was further constrained by Glein et al. (2020) using

CDA data for salt-rich ice grains measured in the plume. However, aqueous activities of
other molecules could not be constrained in this manner, so the wider range of CO 2
abundance determined solely by INMS was adopted in this study. This maintains
consistency in calculations among the other detected species. The method for
determining aqueous activities from INMS data is briefly described here, as a series of
steps starting from the plume gas and back-calculating activities in the ocean. This
process is depicted schematically in Fig 1A.

The abundance of each species detected in the plume gas was assumed to remain
constant once escaping the tiger stripes in the ice shell on Enceladus (Glein et al., 2015,
2020). Under this assumption, each frozen droplet contained a conserved ratio of species
including water as it traveled up the plume and into the INMS. Based on this assumption,
the VMR at Cassini was equal to the VMR immediately above the ice shell. However,
within the fissures in the ice shell, water likely condensed onto the ice as it moved away
from the ocean, enriching the plume gas in solutes relative to the underlying ocean.
Removal of water from the plume can be modeled by comparing vapor saturation
pressures of water above ice at the temperature of the ocean and at the temperatures
measured at the top of the tiger stripes. Traversing Baghdad Sulcus, one of the major
tiger stripes on the moon’s south pole, Cassini’s Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer
(VIMS) measured temperatures of 177-217 K (Goguen et al., 2013). This range was
assumed to represent the temperatures of the consortia of fissures from which solutes
escaped. Glein et al. (2015) showed that experimentally determined steam densities
(Haynes, 2014) at these temperatures and the 273.15 K subsurface ocean can be fit to
obtain

where ρsteam,location represents the density of steam at the given location according to its
temperature. The resulting density ratio can be used to calculate volume mixing ratios,
VMRi,location, of species i in the gas phase immediately above the ocean-gas interface or
immediately above the tiger stripes using

It was assumed that the VMR of each species is the same right above the ocean as in
the ocean as the droplets of ocean water would flash-freeze, preventing species from
entering or exiting. Supporting evidence comes from recent experiments by Neveu et al.
(2024), who showed that fractional abundances of amino and fatty acids recovered after
evacuating and condensing water vapor are largely reflective of their fractional
abundance in the aqueous source, even regardless of charge. VMRs of each species
right above the ocean can be converted into molality m of species i using

where MH2O stands for the molar mass of water. Activities of neutral solutes can be
assumed to approximately equal molality since solutions can be treated as ideal if all
interactions among solutes are assumed to be identical (Anderson, 2015), and the ocean
is not a concentrated brine (Postberg et al., 2009). The activities of solutes in the ocean
are calculated by reference to the temperature of the tiger stripes, which has a
constrained range of 40 Kelvin. Depending on abundances detected for each species and
the temperature at which they escaped from the tiger-stripe fissures, log activities in the
ocean for the compounds other than H2O listed in Table 1 range from -8.33 to -2.42 as
shown in Fig 1B. Affinity results using these activities are therefore also presented as
functions of this temperature range to capture the variability invoked by the range of tigerstripe temperatures. Note that while results are displayed as functions of the tiger-stripe
temperatures, all affinity calculations were done at 273.15 K, the presumed temperature
of the ocean at the ice-water interface.

solutes) and H2O erupt from the subsurface ocean as a plume of gas. As solutes and H2O vaporize and
travel through the tiger stripes, H2O condenses onto the surrounding ice shell as it travels outward, enriching
the plume in solutes. Once out of the ice shell conduit, the ratio of solutes to H2O remains the same as the
gases expand into the vacuum of space and are detected by Cassini’s INMS. (B) Calculated log aqueous
activities (at 273.15 K) of constrained species, resulting from the process illustrated in the left panel using

To demonstrate the importance of considering all options for potential metabolic
reactions, synthesis reactions were written from detected precursor species to neutral
aqueous organic molecules containing carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen
(O), and/or sulfur (S) in the pyCHNOSZ database, a python wrapper (Boyer, 2021) for R
package CHNOSZ (Dick, 2019). Thermodynamic data for all reaction species are

1993; Shock, 1993; 1995; Shock & Helgeson, 1990; Shock & Koretsky, 1993; Shock &
McKinnon, 1993). By doing these calculations, we inclusively simulate the detection of
small and large organics in the plume gas despite INMS’s upper mass limit of 99 amu
(Waite et al., 2004) and explore the implications of detecting these hypothetical organic
molecules for future missions. In fact, some of the organics considered in this study were
detected in low abundances by INMS (Waite et al., 2009) and with some ambiguity by
CDA due to its low mass resolution and ionization method (Khawaja et al., 2019).
Reactions were balanced with H2O and H2. Reactions to form organic compounds
involving nitrogen and/or sulfur were balanced with a nitrogen source and/or H2S,
respectively. Nitrogen sources included NH3 and HCN. Affinities for reactions involving all
combinations of carbon and nitrogen sources were evaluated. Using 273.15 K for the
temperature of the ocean (Glein et al., 2015), equilibrium constants for synthesis
reactions, Kr, were calculated in pyCHNOSZ, using a pressure of 1 bar. One estimated
maximum pressure at the deepest part of the ocean is 74 bars (Glein et al., 2018) and
the change in activities and affinities from 1 to 74 bars is negligible. The activity product,
Qr, was defined for each reaction as the product of all activities, a, of each species i in the
reaction raised to its stoichiometric reaction coefficient, i, using
𝑄𝑟 = ∏ 𝑎𝑖 𝑣𝑖

To represent a reasonable detection limit for mass spectrometers sent on future missions,
a conservative 1 ppm was used as the abundance of organic molecules in the gas phase.
This, along with the VMR of each species in Table 1, were converted into aqueous
activities using Eq 1-3. The aqueous log activities of a hypothetically detected molecule
in the ocean of Enceladus is shown in Fig. 1B. Note that for reactants,  is negative, and
for products,  is positive. Using a ratio of the equilibrium constant, Kr, and reaction
quotient, Qr, for each reaction, the affinity, Ar, in joules per mole of reaction, was calculated
using

3. RESULTS
To explain the affinity results reported in this study, two aqueous molecules –
phenanthrene and alanine – were chosen as examples to represent hypothetical organic
molecules detected at 1 ppm in the plume. These compounds were chosen to
demonstrate the effects of molecular mass on affinities. The same calculations were
undertaken for an additional 211 organic molecules (see supplementary information).
Balanced formation reactions from each carbon source are displayed in Tables 2 and 3.

The affinities for each of these reactions across the range of tiger-stripe temperatures
were calculated. The average affinities at 273.15 K using the abundances calculated for
outgassing at the median temperature (197 K) in the range for the tiger stripes are given
in the tables, along with the error associated with these values caused by uncertainties in
the VMR ranges for reactants (Waite et al., 2009, 2017; Peter et al., 2023). For simplicity,
only NH3 was considered as a source of nitrogen in these examples.

Affinity results in Fig 2 are displayed by order of increasing 𝑍̅𝐶 of the reactants. We
can see that, when using CH4 as the carbon source, both aqueous products have
negative affinities, meaning that their syntheses would require energy if synthesized from
the reactions in Tables 2 and 3. Synthesis of phenanthrene, which has a formula of
C14H10, requires more moles of each carbon source than does that of alanine, which has
a formula of C3H7NO2. This inflates the magnitude of the affinity results for phenanthrene,
while the affinity of alanine remains closer to 0. Reactions from CH4 to phenanthrene and
alanine yield the most negative affinities compared to all carbon sources. Reactions using
either C2H6 or C3H6 are also accompanied by negative affinities, although those for C3H6
are only slightly negative. The affinity results become positive when using carbon sources
with 𝑍𝐶̅ above that of C3H6. Synthesis of phenanthrene from the remaining carbon sources
would release energy if the reaction progressed from the starting activities calculated in
this work. Note that calculations for reactions starting with C2H2, CO and HCN yield more
positive affinities than those from CO2.

Many factors contribute to the calculated affinity of each formation reaction.
Including the examples above, we wrote reactions to form 213 organic compounds from
each of the carbon sources and organized the resulting affinities into 23 groups as shown
in the supplementary information. These include alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols,
ketones, aldehydes, normal carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, 2-hydroxyacids, amino
acids, other acids, aromatic compounds, phenols, phenanthrenes, sugars, alkylamines,
peptides, nucleobases, nucleosides, deoxyribonucleosides, thiols, sulfides, and other
miscellaneous compounds. In the supplementary information, affinities for synthesis from
CH4 and NH3 are shown in Fig S1, from C2H6 and NH3 in Fig S2, from C3H6 and NH3 in
Fig S3, from C2H2 and NH3 in Fig S4, from HCN and NH3 in Fig S5, from CO and NH3 in
Fig S6 and from CO2 and NH3 in Fig S7.

For a more textured example of the multitude of affinities calculated in this study,
the results for affinities of formation of all biogenic amino acids taken from the
supplementary information are shown in Fig 3. In this analysis, HCN was used both as a
carbon source and as a nitrogen source. Due to issues with stoichiometry, it cannot be
used as both, as represented by the open frame in the figure. 𝑍̅𝐶 values for amino acids
vary from +1 to -1 (Dick & Shock, 2021), resulting in the narrow portion of the color
spectrum attained by these results. In most cases, the amino acid plotting closest to Ar =
0 is the smallest amino acid, glycine. The magnitude of affinity is greatest for the largest
amino acids: phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. However, the sign of the affinity
curves changes depending on the carbon source. As a result, the affinities for the largest
amino acids are either more strongly negative, corresponding to a greater input of energy
for synthesis, as in the case of CH4, or more strongly positive as in the case of HCN.

Figure 3. Comparison of different carbon and nitrogen sources on affinities of amino acid synthesis
reactions at 273.15 K plotted against the tiger-stripe temperatures used to determine reactant and product
activities in the ocean on Enceladus. Note that affinities are negative for synthesis from NH3 and CH4,
C2H6, or C3H6, and positive for synthesis from C2H2, CO, and HCN. Results for synthesis from NH3 and
CO2 are mixed. In general, affinities for corresponding amino acid synthesis reactions with HCN as the
nitrogen source are more positive than those using NH3.

When comparing results in Fig 3 between NH3 and HCN as nitrogen sources, it
becomes apparent that reactions involving HCN have slightly elevated reaction affinities.
This arises from the relative instability of the HCN molecule compared to NH3. The overall
shapes of the curves are similar between nitrogen sources. On the other hand, the
affinities are significantly more positive when using HCN as a carbon source than those
from other carbon sources. For this reason and to reduce dimensionality for improved
comprehension, the results shown subsequent to Fig 3 and in the supplementary
information consider HCN only as a carbon source and NH3 as the sole nitrogen source.
Formation reactions, like those shown for phenanthrene and alanine in Tables 2 and 3,

aqueous organic compounds in the pyCHNOSZ database, using NH3, H2S, H2, and H2O
to balance. The position of the calculated affinities with respect to the equilibrium lines

Enceladus is a primary target in the search for life in our solar system (McKay et
al., 2014; Sherwood Lollar et al., 2018). Plumes erupting through cracks in its exterior ice
shell provide evidence for the chemical composition of the subsurface ocean, where the
search for life is targeted. The INMS aboard Cassini had an upper mass limit of 99 amu
(Waite et al., 2004). This limit precludes anything heavier than a heptane molecule,
including most amino acids and all nucleobases, carbohydrates, and cell membrane lipids
along with their degradation products. Therefore, even if these molecules did exist in the
plume, INMS would not have detected them. The CDA, however, had a nominal upper
mass limit of 200 amu, which could be expanded to 8,000 amu at the cost of a ten-fold
decrease in resolution and sensitivity (Postberg et al., 2018). Nonspecific, high molecular
mass signatures around 200-500 amu, 1,000 amu, and 1,700 amu indicated the existence
of macromolecules on Enceladus, perhaps in the form of an organic layer above the
ocean. For the purposes of this study, we narrow our calculations to organic compounds
dissolved in the ocean. As these limitations on spacecraft instrumentation are surpassed,
we may begin to identify and quantify complex organic molecules during our exploration
of the solar system.
4.2 Organics in the solar system
The abundance of organic molecules already found in comets (Burton et al., 2018;
Cronin, 1989; Cronin and Pizzarello, 1983; Elsila et al., 2016; Epstein et al., 1987; Koga
et al., 2017; Martins et al., 2008) may suggest that their presence is ubiquitous in the
solar system. These previously discovered organic molecules are not presumed to be of
biological origin and are instead thought to be abiotic byproducts of processes in the solar
nebula or parent-body processes including water-rock interactions. This implies that their
synthesis was thermodynamically favorable in their original environment (Shock and
Schulte, 1990), unless exogenous energy sources helped promote the reaction.
Separating synthesis reactions by whether they are thermodynamically favorable or
unfavorable with respect to their environment allows us to explore their potential sources.
This categorization is particularly useful because of life’s ability to link thermodynamically
unfavorable biochemical reactions with more favorable energy-capturing reactions.
Chemotrophic organisms fuel biosynthesis reactions using chemical energy acquired
from their environment, while photosynthesizers use the energy from sunlight. We can
see that plant matter is actually unstable based on how readily it reacts with the oxygen
in our atmosphere during a forest fire. Quantifying the energy change during organic

synthesis can help us judge whether an organic molecule may have formed biotically or
abiotically.
4.3 Exploring affinities from various carbon sources
However, we need to take care to not fall into the trap of an Earthly biological bias.
On Earth, we may primarily think about CO2 as a carbon source since it feeds the plant
life around us. Several known carbon fixation pathways that use CO2 on Earth are listed
in Barge and Fournier (2024) along with their advantages and disadvantages within the
context of Enceladus. In a study by Liu et al. (2024), the thermodynamic potential for
organic synthesis from CO2 was calculated as a function of pH, and hence, as a function
of the abundance of reactants (Glein & Waite, 2020). We may build our biosignature
categorizer around the assumption that CO2 is the only possible carbon source on
Enceladus, but there are other possible carbon sources that have been detected with high
confidence including CH4, CO, C2H6, C3H6, C2H2, and HCN (Peter et al., 2023). There is
evidence that most of these can be used as energy sources by organisms on Earth
(Ensign et al., 1992; Hahn et al., 2021; King et al., 2007; Rosner et al., 1997). Some of
these carbon sources are less commonly considered and may be overlooked as
metabolic options or even abiotic building blocks when investigating origins of organic
compounds in our solar system. As revealed in this study, synthesis from some of these
alternate carbons sources is substantially more favorable than from CO2.
4.3.1 Thermodynamic properties
To explore how the choice of reactants affects reaction affinities, and therefore our
interpretation of chemical signatures found on ocean worlds, we can examine the effect
of each variable in the affinity calculation (Eqn 5). First, we can consider Kr, or the
equilibrium constant for the reaction, which is calculated using
∆𝑟 𝐺° = −𝑅𝑇 ln 𝐾𝑟

(7)

where ΔrG° represents the standard state Gibbs energy of a reaction. ΔrG° is calculated
using
∆𝑟 𝐺° = ∑ 𝑣𝑖 × ∆𝑓 𝐺 ° 𝑖

(8)

where i represents the stoichiometric reaction coefficient of species i in the reaction and
ΔfG°i indicates the apparent standard Gibbs energy of formation of that species at any
temperature and pressure. To compare the effects of the thermodynamic properties of
each carbon source on affinity, ΔfG° of each carbon source was calculated at 273.15 K
using pyCHNOSZ (Dick, 2019; Boyer, 2021). The affinities of all reactions from each
carbon source were averaged and plotted against ΔfG° of each carbon source, as shown
in Fig 4.

Figure 4. (left) For simplicity, only VMRs calculated as if they escaped the tiger stripes at the median
temperature (197 K) were used to calculate the affinities in this figure. The reaction affinities from each
carbon source were averaged and then plotted as a function of ΔfG°i of the respective carbon source. Note
that affinity calculations were performed at 273.15 K. Calculations done using reported VMRs are displayed
in blue, while values set to the VMR of CO are displayed in orange. Standard deviations in affinities are
plotted as vertical lines across points. A grey dashed line denotes an affinity of 0, or equilibrium. (right) The
same affinity values are plotted against 𝑍̅c of each carbon source.

4.3.2 Carbon oxidation states and the redox environment
As seen in Fig 4, the ΔfG°i values of carbon sources do not easily explain the
calculated reaction affinities from those carbon sources. A somewhat clearer trend
emerges when displaying these affinities as functions of the 𝑍̅𝐶 of each carbon source.
Reactions from the carbon source with the lowest 𝑍̅𝐶 (CH4 with a 𝑍̅𝐶 of -4) yield the lowest
average affinities. Typically, as 𝑍𝐶̅ increases, so does the average reaction affinity.
However, they peak before the most oxidized carbon source – CO2. In a previous study,
methanogenesis, that is the production of CH4 from CO2 and H2, on Enceladus was
calculated to have a positive affinity and could therefore be a plausible metabolism for
microorganisms (Waite et al., 2017). We have reproduced this result (Fig S7, first panel,
lowest curve) and show that, alternatively, CH4 consumption to form organic molecules is
not thermodynamically favorable (see also Fig S1). Consecutively, C2H6, and C3H6, with
respective 𝑍𝐶̅ of -3, and -2, yield increasingly higher affinities, albeit still negative (see also
Figs S2 and S3). This linear trajectory ends in an average positive affinity for reactions
involving C2H2, which has a 𝑍̅𝐶 of -1 and was shown by Yanez et al. (2024) to be an
exergonic metabolic option at Enceladus (see also Fig S4). The remaining carbon
sources, CO, HCN, and CO2, have 𝑍̅𝐶 of +2, +2, and +4, and also yield positive affinities
(see also Figs S5-S7), with reactions involving HCN yielding the highest average affinities
(see Fig 5). Overall, carbon sources with 𝑍̅𝐶 ≥ -1 yield positive reaction affinities.
Additionally, plotting affinities as functions of the ΔfG° of the products did not yield a
correlation as shown in the supplementary information (Fig S8). To check if the unequal

VMRs detected by INMS for each carbon source were responsible for the variations in
average reaction affinities, the VMRs for all carbon sources were set to that of CO from
Table 1 and affinities were calculated. The results are displayed in Fig 4 as orange dots
that do not differ significantly from the average affinities for measured VMRs. Thus, the
differences in detected VMRs are insufficient to explain the differences in reaction
affinities among carbon sources.

Relatively oxidized carbon sources likely yield higher affinities when used in
organic synthesis reactions because Enceladus’s subsurface is a relatively reducing
environment given the significant amount of H2 (0.4-1.4%) detected in the plume gas by
Cassini’s INMS (Waite et al., 2017). This abundance of H2 is rivaled only by a few
hydrothermal vent systems on Earth, which are sources of known abiotic organic
synthesis (McDermott et al., 2015). Coupled with the more oxidized carbon sources, H2
is often a reactant, and its large aqueous activity combined with its high stoichiometries
drives affinities to positive values (Eqn 4 & 5).

To explicitly explore how H2 stoichiometry affects reaction affinities, the affinities of
formation from each carbon source to all organic compounds, normalized per mole of
carbon in the product, were plotted in Fig 5 as a function of H2 stoichiometry in the
reactions. This normalization was done to remove the effects of the size of each molecule
on reaction affinity as is apparent in Fig 2. Again, only affinities calculated using aqueous
activities calculated using the VMR from the median temperature of the tiger stripes (197
K) are shown. Negative stoichiometries indicate that H2 is a reactant while positive
stoichiometries indicate that H2 is a product. One subplot was made for each carbon
source, ordered from most oxidized on top (CO2) to most reduced (CH4). Each data point
corresponds to the affinity calculated for the formation of an organic compound from one
carbon source. Reaction affinities for each organic compound are displayed seven times
– once per carbon source. Points are colored by 𝑍𝐶̅ of the product molecule.

One obvious feature from this perspective is the horizontal trends along H 2
stoichiometries from each carbon source. These horizontal trends converge towards the
affinity value for compounds with an average oxidation state of carbon of -2. A 𝑍̅𝐶 of -2 is
the value approached with continuous additions of CH2 groups. Compounds in a series
(C1 to C8 alkanes and alcohols, C3 to C8 ketones, C3 to C10 aldehydes, and C1 to C12 thiols
and alkanoic acids) follow or converge along the horizontal trend, with the larger
compounds in the series at the more extreme ends of H2 stoichiometry. The magnitude
of affinity, however, is determined by the carbon source and its stability within the modeled
environment. The trend in Fig 4 can be observed in Fig 5, where reactions from HCN
result in the highest affinities, followed by CO, CO2, C2H2, C3H6, C2H6, and CH4. Generally,
but not perfectly, this hierarchy can be explained by the 𝑍̅𝐶 of the carbon source. Within
subplots from each carbon source, a similar trend is apparent. It is consistently more
favorable to produce reduced compounds versus oxidized compounds, similarly reported
in Liu et al. (2024). Additionally, reactions with negative stoichiometries for H2 tend to have
more positive affinities and vice versa. The reaction which requires the most negative

stoichiometry of H2 is n-octylbenzene formed from CO2. The balanced reaction (R1) is
given by
14 CO2 + 39 H2 = 1 C6H5C8H17 (n-octylbenzene) + 28 H2O

.

(R1)

The high number of H2 molecules required to reduce the carbon in CO2 to n-octylbenzene
is easily supplied in this environment, and pushes the formation reaction forward, lowering
the energy of the system. In contrast, the reaction with the highest positive stoichiometry
for H2 is that from CH4 to guanosine, given by
10 CH4 + 5 H2O + 5 NH3 = 1 C10H13N5O5 (guanosine) + 26 H2

.

(R2)

To oxidize CH4 to guanosine, H2O is required as a reactant, and abundant H2 is produced.
The high activity of H2 in the system combined with its large positive stoichiometry
contributes to a very unfavorable forward reaction, and large negative affinity. Overall, the
more H2 that is produced as a product, the more negative affinity becomes. From this
perspective, the effect of stoichiometry of species in a reaction on affinity calculations can
be understood. These results are similarly strongly affected by the activities of each
species in the reaction. If another ocean world does not have the reducing environment
we expect Enceladus to have, then perhaps reduced carbon sources would yield more
positive affinities.

Among all the components of an affinity calculation, it seems that the H 2
stoichiometry in each reaction most heavily affects the affinity results. This results from
the large abundance of H2 inferred for the ocean on Enceladus as indicated by the VMRs
in the plumes, which causes more reduced compounds to be more thermodynamically
stable and thus yield less energy when consumed for organic synthesis. Other ocean
worlds are likely to yield different results. Let us explore what these results may mean for
biosignature detection.

When a reaction has a positive affinity as written, energy would be released if the
reaction were to proceed. Progress of the forward reaction will drive the system closer to
equilibrium, and any resulting organic compounds would be plausibly abiotic. It may be
possible that the reaction is actively progressing but has not yet reached equilibrium,
perhaps due to kinetic barriers. Alternatively, a negative affinity would indicate that there
is more product than is thermodynamically favorable. This means that the reverse
reaction would release energy, while the forward reaction would require energy. If we are
modeling the environment correctly in which the molecule was synthesized and an affinity
calculation for the formation reaction in those conditions yielded a negative affinity, there
must have been some kind of energy input for synthesis to occur. This could involve
external energy input of an abiotic nature, such as surface impacts or radiation, or
perhaps from the biological coupling of endergonic reactions with exergonic reactions. In
living systems, the synthesis of biomolecules generally requires energy, but thanks to the
complex machinery evolved over the history of life on Earth, energy-releasing chemical
reactions are used to fuel energy-requiring anabolic processes. Chemotrophic life on
Earth can harvest chemical energy from chemical reactions and store it in molecules like
ATP. This stored energy is then used to build biomolecules. If there was a biosphere on
Enceladus, it may have evolved similar mechanisms. Therefore, if we detect an organic
molecule in an abundance that seems to be thermodynamically unstable in its
environment, it would be possibly biotic, and we may want to target the locations these
molecules were found for further investigation.

There are a couple of caveats to this sorting process that should be considered.
As for the case in which a positive affinity is calculated for molecular synthesis, it is
possible that this molecule was produced biotically. There are examples of biological
synthesis on Earth that are energetically favorable (Shock and Canovas, 2010). In fact,
abiotic organic synthesis may have been key to the emergence of life on Earth, and
primitive organisms may have taken advantage of energy-releasing biosynthesis
reactions. Additionally, perhaps the energy gradient was irrelevant to the organism
performing the reaction, and it synthesized the molecule regardless of its environmental
stability, if it has a sufficiently evolved metabolism to fuel that reaction. On the other hand,

there are cases in which a negative affinity may not be a biosignature, including the case
in which a molecule was synthesized abiotically, and the reaction was thermodynamically
favorable, but that molecule was then transported into an environment where it was
unstable, and it has not been broken down yet. Likewise, the conditions around the
molecule may have changed, causing it to become unstable with respect to its
environment, and it has not yet been broken down. Investigations into icy moons pose
the challenge of not having any spatial resolution. For Enceladus, we have the plume gas
detected by Cassini, and it may well be an average of the conditions of the various
potential sources of the plume. Additionally, impact of plume material onto the INMS likely
caused degradation of source molecules and generation of byproducts, as modeled by
Jaramillo-Botero et al. (2012). Until there is more spatial resolution, and the effects of
impact velocities on detected molecules are better understood, there will be uncertainty
about whether a molecule was produced in the conditions that we are modeling.

predominantly in positive affinities, with the exception of some oxidized compounds such
as sugars and nucleobases (Fig S7). As in Liu et al. (2024), affinities for the synthesis of
formaldehyde and acetylene from CO2 are negative. However, there is no reason to
assume such compounds originated from only CO2. If we only consider CO2 as a plausible
carbon source, we may believe these compounds to be biosignatures. In contrast, with a
full picture of potential carbon sources we conclude that formation of these molecules at
the chosen abundance of 1 ppm would be thermodynamically favorable, and therefore
plausibly abiotic. On Enceladus, it seems that there are favorable avenues for the
synthesis of all compounds considered in this study, depending on the source of carbon
used in the calculations. Therefore, volatile organics detected by INMS (Waite et al.,
2009) and those mixed in with the ice grains measured by CDA (Khawaja et al., 2019)
may not be most easily explained by the presence of life. However, reactions to form more
complex molecules may require energy, especially if we allow the carbon to be consumed
by organic synthesis, which was not done here. In these cases, it may become difficult to
explain their presence without biological processes. Therefore, such compounds may be
placed in the category possibly biotic. While they may be biotically produced, they are not
required to be so.

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The results presented here demonstrate that reactions to form many aqueous
organic compounds can be thermodynamically favorable with at least one of the carbon
sources detected in the plumes on Enceladus. Therefore, if any of these hypothetical
organic compounds were detected, the interpretation would be the same: these
compounds are plausibly abiotic. The homogeny of these interpretations may seem
lackluster, but as more complicated models are built, texture may emerge. For example,
reactions could be written from detected precursors to more than one organic product per
reaction, accounting for better mass balance between the carbon sources and a multitude
of organic products. This would be a step in the right direction regarding the quantification

of energy required to make whole cells. Afterall, carbon sources may run out as more
organic material is generated. The limited supply of each carbon source is not captured
in this study. Additionally, biomolecules themselves can be much more massive and
complicated. With increased abilities to estimate thermodynamic properties of organic
molecules, we may one day be able to model the thermodynamic stability of more
convincing biosignatures.
