Abstract
The (BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) composite has been developed deploying glycine as fuel in a selfcombustion process. It was employed to remove methyl green (MG), a cationic dye, and methyl
orange (MO), an anionic dye, from aqueous solutions. It was characterized by specific surface area
measurement (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). FTIR spectra showed three bands located around 548.18 cm-1,
973. cm-1, and 1577.01 cm-1 attributed to the stretching vibrations of Bi-O, Fe-O, Mg-O, and O-H,
respectively. The SEM images revealed a highly porous and irregular structure beneficial for the
effective diffusion of dye molecules. The sample contains a notable proportion of holes with different
sizes of pores. The microcavities observed on the adsorbent surface were conducive to good diffusion
of the dye molecules. The composite's mesoporous structure was deduced by BET analysis, which
allowed us to determine the material's specific surface area of 20.289 m2/g and its pore diameter of
7.54 nm. X-ray diffraction showed peaks attributed to Fe3O4, MgO, and Bi2O3 (confirming the
presence of BiMgFeO4 ferrite) and other peaks attributed to dehydrated hemicellulose and
carbon/graphite (confirming the use of activated carbon). The various experimental parameters
affecting the performance of this reaction, such as temperature, contact time, initial dye concentration,
and adsorbent mass, were studied. The composite's pH zero charge point (pHPZC) was found to be 8.77.
The equilibrium isotherms were described using the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models. The
equilibrium time was a function of the starting dye concentration in the adsorption tests. Adsorption
equilibrium for (BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) was formed after 120 min, according to adsorption
kinetic analysis. Moreover, the results revealed that pseudo-second-order kinetics could correctly
characterize the adsorption of MO and MG on the composite. Adsorption isotherms confirmed that the
adsorption process of both dyes onto the (BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) composite was successful. The
Langmuir model appears to be best suited to the adsorption of MO and MG on
the(BiMgFeO4/activated carbon), with a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.078 mg.g-1 and 192.307

mg.g-1 respectively, at 298 K. The adsorption of the two dyes was spontaneous and exothermic, in line
with the thermodynamic parameters associated with the sorbent/adsorbate system. The determination
of the isosteric heat of adsorption revealed that physisorption takes place with weak intermolecular
interactions between the two dyes and the composite surface.

1 Introduction
The manufacture of colorants and their application in numerous modern industrial sectors are
continuously expanding. They find applications in the food, paper, pharmaceutical, textile, and
cosmetics sectors. However, dyes are a major hazard to the ecosystems and the health of organisms
because they accumulate in industrial wastes [1-3]. Numerous research teams have been focused on
developing efficient and fast methods of treating contaminated water in the past few decades. Among
the wastewater treatment methods are adsorption, coagulation-flocculation, membrane separation,
chemical oxidation, and biological treatment [4,5].
Adsorption proved to be particularly interesting and successful in treating organic dye-contaminated
water. Studies have been conducted on a variety of synthetic and natural adsorbents; the most wellknown is activated carbon, whose preparation costs are still rather high [6–8].
However, because of their remarkable ability to adsorb large amounts of organic and inorganic
pollutants present in aqueous solutions, and since they can be recycled to remove more dyes, magnetic
materials—and in particular, magnetic nanocomposites—have attracted much

interest [9,10]. In

recent years, several types of ferrite have been studied for their interesting magnetic, electrical, and

optical properties and have seen a variety of applications. Doped ferrites have been specifically
applied to antibacterial activity, dye and heavy metal removal, and photodegradation [3,11].
It is commonly known that activated carbon plays a crucial role in the adsorption of pollutants. A
material with a remarkable porous structure, activated carbon is derived from carbon-based materials
such as wood or coconut shells. Its main applications include drinking water purification, air
decontamination, and wastewater treatment [4]. It is suggested to use activated carbon to eliminate
several kinds of contaminants, including chemicals, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and
other undesired materials. The ability to reuse activated carbon over extended periods is a significant
benefit. This regeneration process, often achieved by heating and releasing absorbed contaminants,
turns activated carbon into recyclable material [12,13]. Due to its remarkable capacity to absorb a
wide range of pollutants and thereby aid in the purification of our key resources, activated carbon is
playing an increasingly important role in maintaining the purity of the environment and human health
[14,15].
To treat water contaminated by two dyes, one cationic dye, Methyl Green (MG), and the other anionic
dye,

Methyl

(MO)

[16,17],

we

have

suggested

creating

a

novel

composite

(BiMgFeO4/Activated Carbon) from a new BiMgFeO4-doped nanoferrite [18,19,11] Both of these
dyes are widely used colors in the textile industry. So, they are among the most common organic
pollutants found in wastewater.
The BiMgFeO4/activated carbon composite was produced by a self-combustion method developed
from the sol-gel process, using glycine as fuel [20]. This composite was characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
measuring its specific surface area using the BET method [21-23]. We investigated the effects of
adsorbent dose, contact time, initial pH, and temperature on the adsorption of organic dyes in a
discontinuous system [24]. We have also performed a thermodynamic and kinetic study and applied
some models of adsorption isotherms, such as the Freundlich and Langmuir models [25-28].

For the activated carbon, the raw material used originates from the Oméga Tunisie essential oil
extraction company, located in the Sidi Bouzid region. These seeds are the final by-product of the
prickly pear essential oil extraction process [29-31].
2.2. Preparation of Activated carbon
2.2.1. Raw materia
In the search for new precursors, prickly pear seeds were included in this study,. Prickly pears are
grown all around the Mediterranean region; due to its warm climate conducive to the development of
the prickly pear, but also to its physico-chemical characteristics. Tunisia has been classified as one of
the most productive countries for this fruit, and used in many food and cosmetic applications [30, 31].
Prickly pear seed oil cake has been produced in large quantities as a by-product of the Prickly pear
seed oil extraction industry. Consequently, the preparation of activated carbons with this raw material
is an interesting approach in order to valorize this raw material [32]. The raw material used originates
from the Oméga Tunisie essential oil extraction company, located in the Sidi Bouzid region.

2.3 Preparation of Nanomaterials
2.3.1 The General Strategy of the Work
The composite was produced by the process of self-combustion. Subsequently, we explained that it
possesses the ability to chelate metals by creating a highly stable and soluble complex while
maintaining solvent volume. A more detailed explanation is provided in Sect. 2.3.2.
Figure 2 shows the entire preparation and application process of an adsorbent.

2.3.2 Preparation of the BiMgFeO4/Activated carbon Composite
BiMgFeO4/Activated carbon composite was synthesized using the same process for the production
of Mg-doped bismuth ferrite powder BiMgFeO4 nanoferrite by the self-combustion method [33].
However, Activated carbon was inserted before the addition of the combustible agent. The raw
materials used are iron (III) nitrate Fe(NO3)3.9H2O, magnesium (II) nitrate Mg(NO3)2.6H2O,
bismuth(III) nitrate Bi(NO3)3.5H2O, Activated carbon and glycine C2H5NO2. The chemicals were
dissolved in distilled water in accordance with a calculated stoichiometric ratio, and all component
molar ratios were set to one (except glycine). The combustible agent (Glycine) was introduced after a
few minutes respecting the following condition:
n glycine = nFe3+ + nMg2+ + nBi3+
where n is the mole number.

nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2.6H2O) were dissolved
independently in 50 mL of distilled water. Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate Bi(NO3)3.5H2O was added
after ferric nitrate nonahydrate Fe(NO3)3.9H2O and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate Mg(NO3)2.6H2O
were combined at 80–90 °C while being stirred by heat until a homogenous mixture was formed. A
little while later, the combustible agent (glycine) was added after the activated carbon (Fig.2).
The obtained homogeneous solution was mixed under thermal stirring 80-180°C. Stirring continuously
for 3 hours, then the solution was evaporated in order to obtain a dry gel. This last was then forced by
self-ignition by rapid heating. The rapid evaluation of a large volume of gas is accompanied by a
significant loss of mass during combustion, leading to the formation of numerous foams and sparks,
resulting in a bulky and fluffy product in the container. The obtained fine powder was ground with a
mortar and pestle to obtain nanoparticles. Finally, it was kept in an oven for 3 hours at a temperature
in the area of 80°C-180°C to improve its crystallinity and remove residual organic matter.
2.4. Characterizations of the Nanoparticles
The synthesized composite was subjected to FTIR measurement at room temperature in a range of
400 to 4000 cm−1 using KBr pellets solid (10% solid) in a Shimadzu 8400-S spectrometer.
Using Meso400A-01-Analysis equipment, and static volumetric method, N2 adsorption-desorption
measures were performed at 77.35 K to determine the synthesized material's Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(SBET) specific surface area and pore structure parameters. The sample (0.1 g) was degassed for eight
hours at 300°C before measurement.
We recorded powder diffractograms using a Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) D8 Advance Bruker
two-circle diffractometer equipped with a Lynx eye detector. The θ-2θ scan utilized the dichromatic
copper radiation (λ CuK α1/α2). These were the wavelengths: λKα2 = 0.154 439 nm and λKα1 = 0.154
060 nm. Complete diffraction power of 30 mA / 40 kV. Scanning: drive axis: θ-2θ, scan range:
10.0000 - 80.0000 (deg), scan mode: Continuous Scan, scan speed: 2.0000 (deg/min), sampling pitch:
0.2000 (deg), preset time: 6.00 (sec)
The morphology of the prepared material was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
micrographs obtained with a ZEISS-ULTRA55 SEM microscope that is completely controlled from a
computer workstation. An accelerating voltage of 20 kV was applied to the zirconated tungsten
filament.
The pH of the point of zero charge (pHPZC) was determined using the pH drift method [34].
Aqueous solutions with various pH values between 2 and 12 and NaCl (0.1 M) were created by adding
sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. Then, the NaCl solutions were mixed with 0.15 g of nano

ferrite. When the pH was adjusted to a value between 2 and 12, the suspension reached equilibrium
after 2.5 hours of agitation. A correlation was established between the initial pH and the final pH
measured. The nanomaterial's zero charge point (PZC) is the pH value at which the pH (final) = pH
(initial) line intersects. However, each of these various pH tests was carried out simultaneously.

2.5 Batch Adsorption
2.5.1 Analytical Method
After the adsorption tests, the concentration of both dyes was measured using a Beckman UV/Vis
DU 800 Spectrophotometer, with λmax = 465 nm for Methy Orange and 632 nm for Methyl Green as
the maximum wavelengths. Eq. (1) was utilized to determine the equilibrium adsorption capacity Q

With V (L) representing the volume of the solution, m (g) as the mass of the composite, Ce (mg. L −1)
as the equilibrium concentration of the contaminant under study, and C0 being its initial concentration.
2.5.2

Effect of Initial pH, Adsorbent Dose and Temperature

To determine the impacts of temperature, initial pH, and adsorbent dose, batch mode pollutant
adsorption tests were conducted. In order to assess the impact of initial pH, we have performed studies
at room temperature using 10 mL of dye solution (50 mg. L−1). After adding a fixed dose of 10 mg of
adsorbent, a pH meter was used to adjust the pH from 2 to 12 by adding HCl or NaOH solutions (0.1
mol. L−1). In a water bath shaker under temperature control at 60 rpm, the solutions were shaken for
720 minutes. After filtering the samples, the concentration was measured.
We conducted experiments with adsorbent dosages ranging from 5 to 150 mg to find the most
effective one. The tests were performed using the same methodology and conditions as previously
mentioned.
In order to evaluate the influence of temperature on the adsorption process of the composite, we mixed
50 mg of the composite under study with 100 mL of dye solutions (C = 50 mg L −1), and we observed
the reaction at various temperatures (2, 7, 15, 25, 40, 60, and 75 °C).
2.5.3

Adsorption Kinetic Studies

To assess the effect of contact time on adsorption, the subsequent processes were used: At room
temperature (25 °C) and for the required contact period (which can vary from 0 to 720 minutes), 50
mg of adsorbent was mixed with 100 mL of the investigated dye solution (50 mg. L−1).

2.5.4

Adsorption Isotherms

The initial dye concentration (20-200 mg.L-1) was varied for 720 minutes to conduct the
experiments. A mass of 50 mg of adsorbent was used in each test. Using Langmuir's Equation, Eq. (2)
[35], and Freundlich Equation, Eq. (3) [36] the experimental points were analyzed:

3. Results and Discussions
3.1 Characterization of the BiMgFeO4/Activated carbon Composite with Infrared Spectrum

Fig. 3 FTIR spectra of BiMgFeO4/Activated carbon composite

The study of the BiMgFeO4/Activated carbon Composite's infrared spectra (Fig. 3) revealed a large
absorption band ranging from 2500 to 3500 cm−1, which was associated with the internal OH groups'
elongation vibrations. In addition to the stretching vibrations of the adsorbed water, the band at 1577
cm−1 could also be attributed to the valence vibrations of the OH group of the constituent water.
Moreover, the vibrations of the nitrate generated from the iron nitrate nonahydrate, a component ofthe

composite, are responsible for the peak at 1321.77 cm−1. In general, the infrared spectrum of spinel
ferrites exhibited characteristic bands associated with intrinsic vibrations of the oxygen bonds with
metal cations on the two subarrays [37,38]. The metal–oxygen bands were found in the 400–1000 cm-1
range. The Fe–O stretching vibration, which matched the first band on the spectrum, was detected at
about 419 cm-1. The elongation of the Mg-O bond was responsible for the second band, located at
548.18 cm−1, while the Bi-O stretching vibration was responsible for the third band, located at 730.28
cm−1 [39, 40]. The significant band at 973.98 cm-1 is commonly described in oxidized carbons and has
been associated with C-O elongation in acid groups, alcohols, phenols, ethers, and/or ester groups
[41], found in activated carbons. The spectrum's weakly intense band at around 1450 cm-1 can be
assigned to the methyl group (CH in CH3), the deformation (bending) band of O-H in activated
carbon, and/or the deformation (bending) vibrations (δ) of CH2. The aromatic C=C bonds responsible
for the adsorption peaks between 2000 and 2300 cm-1 in the IR spectrum of the BiMgFeO4 /activated
carbon composite derive from the benzene-rich aromatic structure of activated carbon derived from
prickly pear (lignin). Activated carbon obtained from prickly pear contains an abundance of aromatic
organic molecules which give rise to characteristic adsorption bands in this region of the infrared
spectrum. These peaks are due to the vibrations of the valence of the C=C bonds of the aromatic rings
present in the structure of the activated carbon [42].

Fig. 4 SEM images of BiMgFeO4/ Activated Carbon composite (a- f) at different magnifications

At high magnifications, nodular and non-homogeneous particles of different sizes were visible on
the surface of the composite (Fig. 4c-f). On the other hand, SEM images showed an irregular and very
porous structure advantageous for good diffusion of dye molecules, with a significant fraction of holes
and varied pore sizes present in the sample (Fig. 4d). The emission of several gases (NO, NO2, CO,
NH3, and H2O) during combustion process may often be deployed to explain the voids and a highly
porous structure [43, 44].

An important spongy structure was observed in the BiMgFeO4/Activated Carbon composite (Fig. 4a,
b), which was specifically caused by the effect of the glycine utilized as the combustion agent. The
voids, which related to the release of a significant amount of gases during the combustion
process, were identified as the source of the different-sized pores seen in the sample. Since the ejection
of associated gas resulted in a highly porous structure with non-homogeneous and agglomerated
particles. The porosity that resulted was an essential factor in the development of adsorption.
The morphological structure of the ferrite-derived composite’s surface and the amount and
size of its pores and cavities have all been changed by the addition of activated carbon during
its production. The resultant composite revealed surface enrichment due to enhanced porosity
and improved spongy structure and heterogeneity of the adsorbent. This occurrence enhanced
the composite's capacity to adsorb dyes.

Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3): in various positions, Bi2O3 appears to be the most common element in this
species, seen from different angles thanks to multiple corresponding peaks. Its existence is
confirmed by peaks at 28.099°, 30.4428°, 32.7°, 46.43°, 47.22°, 54.22°, 55.54° and 57.85°. The
frequency of these peaks indicates the high crystallinity of this compound in the sample.



Fe3O4 (Magnetite): Peaks are also observed at 31.84° and 35.61°, although the presence of
magnetite is less significant than that of Bi2O3. Despite the decrease in abundance, these peaks
indicate a significant presence of Fe3O4 in the sample.



Carbon/Graphite: Carbon or graphite is present in the peak at 25.21°, but appears to be less
abundant than Bi2O3 or magnetite, as the peak is single and less intense.



Magnesium oxide (MgO): Although less dominant than Bi2O3, MgO is also present. Its peak at
62.57° indicates that it is present in the sample.



Dehydrated hemicellulose: Although less obvious, the presence of dehydrated hemicellulose was
also detected at the peak at 43.07°, suggesting a low presence of dehydrated hemicellulose in the
sample relative to the other elements.

3.4 Measurement of the Specific Surface Area of the Composite by BET Analysis
The specific surface area and the distribution and pore size were determined from adsorption–
desorption isotherms of liquid nitrogen at – 195.8° C (77.35 K) [45]. Because of the limitations in N2
adsorption, this approach can only assess the material's external surface [46]. The composite results
are provided below (Fig. 6).

Fig.6 Adsorption and desorption isotherms of N2 on BiMgFeO4/activated carbon composite

Figure 6 displays the analysis of nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at low temperatures,
and shows that, at low pressures, there is strong adsorption followed by a gradual increase in the
quantity of adsorbed gas, which is quite significant for the composite. Then, at relatively high
pressure, a capillary condensation phenomenon is observed, distinguished during desorption by the

presence of a type H3 hysteresis loop, which is quite large for the composite. suggested that the
isotherm plot recorded with BiMgFeO4/ Activated Carbon composite belongs to the type III
adsorption isotherm in the classification of Brunauer, Deming and Teller (BDDT) [47]. That isotherm
explains the formation of multilayer, and suggests relatively weak adsorbent-adsorbate interactions.
The volume of N2 adsorbed by BiMgFeO4/ Activated Carbon composite reached 18.76 cm3/g at
high pressure, due to the increase of the specific surface. The specific surface area calculated using the
BET equation was 20.289 m2/g for the composite. The size of the pore volume in the (BiMgFeO4/
Activated Carbon) composite was 0.037 cm3/g, and the pore diameter was 7.54 nm (Table 1). The
mean volumes of the pores as well as their diameters of the powder were calculated by the method of
Barrett—Joyner—Halenda BJH [48]. The composite was a mesoporous material with a surface area of
20.289 m2/g and diameters of the pores ranged from 2 to 50 nm. This mesoporous structure was well
suited to the removal of the anionic and cationic dyes.

Determination of Point of Zero Charge pH (PZC) for the BiMgFeO4/activated carbon

composite
The point of zero charge (pHPZC) is one of the most significant parameters used to characterize the
variable-charge surface properties of minerals. It is related to the charge on the particle's surface and
is greatly affected by the pH of the material. The concept of point of zero charge (pzc) is important for
determining the behavior of colloidal materials, particularly those with sizes smaller than one
micrometer. The surface and nature of the adsorbent have a significant impact on the adsorption of any
type of ion at different pH levels. The pHPZC of the adsorbent can be used to describe its surface
charge. When the pH at the adsorbent surface is less than pHPZC, there is an excess of positive charge
on the surface, which allows for the adsorption of anions. Inversely, the surface charge would be
negative for pH values higher than pHPZC, permitting cations to be adsorbed [49]. The experimental
curve illustrating final pH versus initial pH intersects with the bisector (final pH = initial pH) to
identify the pHPZC of the composite [50].
The pHPZC of the BiMgFeO4/activated carbon composite is 8.77, as depicted in Fig. 7. The surface
of the adsorbent is positively charged, and anions would be adsorbed at this pH zone if the solution's
pH was lower than 8.77. Excess H+ protons from the solution would protonate the adsorbent's surface

functional groups, attracting negatively charged adsorbate to the support. The following illustration
shows how the hydroxyl group bonded to the metal gets protonated:
(M-OH + H+

M-OH2+, where M is metal).

The surface of the composite turns negative when the pH of the solution exceeds pH PZC as a result
of the metal's hydroxyl group deprotonation.

Fig. 8 pH effect on the adsorption of methyl orange and methyl green on the BiMgFeO4/activated carbon
composite. ([dye] = 50 mg. L−1, adsorbent amount = 10 mg, time = 720 min, T = 25 °C)

The results show that the adsorption of dye onto the adsorbent was significantly affected by
solution pH. It is observed that the best adsorption capacities of MO were obtained at acidic pH values
(Fig.8). This could be justified based on the pHPZC which is 8,77 for the obtained composite. At a pH <
pHPZC, the charge on the surface of the ferrite is positive, which causes a higher electrostatic attraction
of the dye anions, leading to higher adsorption. At pH above pHPZC, the ferrite surface charge becomes
negative, so there is repulsion between the anions in the solution and the negative charge of the ferrite
surface, thus, a decrease in the adsorption capacity is observed. While It was found that the amount of
dye adsorbed increases from 58.86 to 99. 48% with increasing pH from 2 to 12.
Note that the pH affected the behavior of BiMgFeO4/activated carbon in basic medium (pH = 9 to 12),
which was observed visually, a loss of color of the solution, thus turning transparent. Therefore, the
study is limited to a pH range between 2 < pH < 12. Lower adsorption capacity at lower pH (acidic
medium), is mainly due to the competition between H+ cations present in excess in the solution and
cationic molecules dye for the same adsorption site onto the surface of the activated carbon.
In conclusion, acidic pH is the optimal medium to have a better adsorption of the MO anionic dye,
while basic pH is the optimal medium to have a better adsorption of the MG.

Effect of the Adsorbent Dose on the adsorption of methyl orange and methyl green

In order to study the influence of the adsorbent dose on the adsorption of MG and MO (50 mg. L-1),
the mass of BiMgFeO4/activated carbon composite as adsorbent was varied from 0.05 g to 1.5 g per
100 ml of sample volume (Fig. 9).

The figure 9 shows that the percentage of MO removal increases (from 37.49% to 98.75 %) with
increasing adsorbent mass, whereas the MO adsorption capacity decreases drastically from 451.12 to
39.59 mg/g. Because adsorption sites were entirely accessible for the polluent at low adsorbent
dosage, the adsorption capacity was increased. However, at high adsorbent doses, the majority of the
low-energy adsorption sites were first occupied. Consequently, the accessibility of high-energy
adsorption sites significantly decreased, and adsorption capacity was reduced [51]. Moreover, the
higher the adsorbent dose, the more likely collisions and agglomeration between solid particles
occurred, leading to a decrease in total surface area and ferrite adsorption capacity for the polluent.
Increasing the mass of the adsorbent offers an increased number of available adsorption sites and
therefore increased amount of adsorbed dye [52]. While the decrease of dyes adsorption could be
explained by the saturation of adsorption sites [53].
The figure above (Fig.9) demonstrates that the removal efficiency of MG increases by 54.08 % to
94.38% while the adsorption capacity of MG decreases drastically by 566.83 mg/g to 32.97. mg/g.
This can be understood, as increasing the mass of the adsorbent increases the specific surface area and
hence the number of adsorption sites available, leading to an increase in the amount of dye adsorbed .
The decrease in the amount of MG dye adsorbed per unit mass (mg/g) could be explained by the
saturation of adsorption sites.

3.6.3

Effect of the Contact Time on the adsorption of Methyl Orange and Methyl Green
using BiMgFeO4/ activated carbon composite

The MO and MG discoloration test by adsorption on (BiMgFeO4-Activated carbon) composite
(Fig.10) was performed by monitoring the contact time of the adsorption equilibrium, where a
saturated state of the substrate is established. It is considered the most critical parameter in the
development of an economical wastewater treatment system [40]. Thus, the identification of contact
time enables adsorption isotherms to be established. In fact, the contact time is fundamental in
determining the maximum adsorption quantity. The adsorption capacity or removal rate can be
calculated from Eq. (4)
(4)

With C0: initial concentration and Ct: concentration at time t.
The equilibrium studies were performed at predefined time intervals ranging from 30 to 720 min and
with different adsorbent masses (10, 50, and 100 mg) (Fig.11) to determine the optimal adsorption
time.

respectively. Experimental results indicated that the optimum contact time for MO removal was 120

mtinute.The removal efficiency (%) of both MO and MG increases as the contact time varies from 20
to 120 minutes before becoming constant, as shown in Figure 10. Consequently, 120 minutes was
taken as the equilibrium time. At this point, the amount of dye desorbed from the adsorbent is in a
state of dynamic equilibrium with the amount of dye adsorbed on the adsorbents.
The adsorption is rapid during the first few minutes of the reaction, which can be interpreted by the
fact that at the start of adsorption, the number of active sites available on the adsorbent surface is much
greater than the number of sites remaining after a certain time. For long contact times, the molecule
needs time to diffuse into the adsorbent pore [43], while the saturation of the adsorbent surface
interprets the remaining quantity not adsorbed (all adsorption sites are occupied). Therefore, the
equilibration time of 120 minutes was sufficient in this case as maximum adsorption occurred during
this time. It was due to the aggregation of the dye particles with increasing contact time, which made
it almost impossible to diffuse deeper into the adsorbent structure at higher energy sites. This
aggregation canceled out the influence of contact time as the pores filled in and began to offer
resistance to diffusion of aggregated dye molecules into the adsorbents [54].

It is known that increasing temperature increases the rate of diffusion of adsorbate molecules
through the outer boundary layer and inside the adsorbent particles, due to the decrease in solution
viscosity [55]. Figure 12 reveals that at 25 °C, the maximum removal rate of the MO dye on
BiMgFeO4/ Activated Carbon composite was 66.87%. At the same temperature, it was 81.28% for MG.
This suggests that thermal excitation of the adsorption reaction is not required above 25°C to enhance
the adsorption capacity of composite (BiMgFeO4/Activated carbon) for methyl orange and methyle
green.
From the comparison of the two curves in the figure above (Fig.12), we conclude that room
temperature is the most suitable temperature for the maximum removal of the methyl orange (anionic
dye) and the methyle green (cationic dye) by the composite prepared. An increase in temperature is
not favorable to the adsorption phenomenon, which could prove that this is an exothermic mechanism.

3.6.5.

Adsorption Kinetic

The speed at which the constituents diffuse in the adsorbent and the fluid as well as the adsorbentadsorbate interaction determine when the thermodynamic equilibrium between the adsorbate in the
liquid phase and the adsorbate fixed on the solid is reached. We can examine the impact of contact
time on the dye's retention by analyzing the dye's adsorption on the nano ferrite as a function of time.
For this purpose, the pseudo-first order (Eq. 5) and the pseudo-second order models have been used to
explain the mechanism of

the methyl orange and the methyl green adsorption kinetics on the

BiMgFeO4/ activated carbon composite. (Eq. 6) [56, 57]:

Qt (mg/g) : the adsorption capacity at time t
k1 (mn-1) is the constant of the pseudo-first order model. And k2 (g.mg-1.mn-1) constant of the pseudosecond order model.
For a concentration of both the methyl orange and the methyl green dyes studied equal to 50 mg/L, the
values of the quantity adsorbed, the constant k1 of the pseudo-first order model, the constant k2 of the
pseudo-second order model, as well as the correlation coefficient are well grouped in the following
table (Table 2).

Table 2 Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models parameter

From the table above (Table 2), it can be seen that the values of the R2 correlation coefficients are
very high with the pseudo-second order model, and are all close to the unit (R2= 0.999 for the MO and
0.998 for the MG), far exceeding those obtained with the pseudo-first-order model (respectively R2=
0.95 and 0.981). Likewise, the equilibrium adsorbed quantities (Qe) are very close to the values found
experimentally. These last two observations lead us to believe that the adsorption process of both MO
and MG on the prepared composite does indeed follow the pseudo-second order model. The pseudofirst order parameters applied to the adsorption of MO and of MG on the BiMgFeO4/activated carbon
composite were determined by extrapolation of the curve representing the variation of Ln (Qe-Qt) as a
function of time t (min) (Fig. 13).

As can be seen from the above Figure (Fig. 13), the adsorption kinetics of methyl orange and
methyl green by our composite do not follow first-order kinetic, as the experimental adsorbed amount
differs from the calculated one and the correlation coefficient values are slightly different from unity.
However, the figure below (Fig.14) clearly illustrates that the results of the pseudo-second order
kinetic model obey the adsorption of both Methyl Orange and Methyl Green dyes onto the
BiMgFeO4/activated carbon composite . The two quantities, k2 constant of the pseudo-second order
model, and Qe the adsorbed capacity at equilibrium, correspond respectively to the y-intercept and the
slope of the straight line representing the variation of t /Qt as a function of time t (min), and the values
of the regression coefficient are given in the Table 2 above.

Table 3 Thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of MO and MG on BiMgFeO 4/activated carbon
composite

The adsorption process of Methyl Orange (MO) and Methyl Green (MG) on the BiMgFeO 4/activated
carbon composite was exothermic, as indicated by the negative ΔH0 values shown in Table 3. In
addition, the increased degree of freedom of the adsorbed molecules and the rise in molecular disorder
at the solid/liquid interface of the adsorption process was indicated by the positive values of ΔS0.
Since ΔH0 and ΔS0 have opposing signs, changing the temperature has no discernible effect on the free

3.6.7. Adsorption isotherm of methyl orange and methyl green on (BiMgFeO4/activated carbon)
composite
To assess the experimental results, models like Freundlich (Eq. 11) and Langmuir (Eq. 9) were
employed. The Langmuir isotherm model is one of the isotherms that are most frequently used in
adsorption to evaluate an adsorbate's highest potential for adsorption on an adsorbent. Adsorption
must occur on a homogeneous adsorbent surface with monolayer coverage of adsorbate. Furthermore,
according to this concept, adsorption occurs in specific homogenous, energetically similar sites [59].
(9)

𝐋

With KL (L.mg-1) is Langmuir equilibrium constant related to the affinity of adsorption, Q m (mg. g-1) is
the maximum adsorption capacity in monolayer, and Ce is the concentration at equilibrium. The
dimensionless equilibrium constant for the Langmuir isotherm can be expressed as (Eq. 10) [50]:

𝐑𝐋

(10)

𝐋

The separation factor, RL is defined by (Eq. 10) . The adsorption isotherm is unfavorable when RL > 1,
it is linear when RL = 1, it is favorable when 0 < RL< 1 and it is irreversible when "RL=0 ".
The Freundlich model assumes heterogeneous surface energy. This model is widely used to describe
multilayer adsorption [60]. The no-linear form of the Freundlich can be expressed as follows:

𝐋

𝐋

𝐋

(11)

Where KF is the Freundlich constant (heterogeneity factor), and 1/n is the Freundlich coefficient. n is
related to sorption affinity and KF is related to the sorption capacity.
When the coefficient n is between 1 and 10, the adsorbent's efficiency in adsorption is increased [61].
Actually, if n=1, adsorption proceeds linearly, there are no interactions between the species to be
adsorbed, and the energy of the adsorption sites is uniform. In contrast, the adsorbent support's surface
will change in a way that enhances the adsorption capacity if n > 1. Nevertheless, the adsorption
becomes unfavorable and the adsorption capacity sharply drops for n < 1 or n << 1 [62, 63].
The table below (Table 4) displays the results of the modeling studies of the adsorption isotherms for
the two models (Langmuir and Freundlich) and the correlation coefficients (R2). And the Figure 16
depicts the adsorption isotherms for both anionic and cationic dyes.

(R = 0.996 for MG and MO) and the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.992 for MG and 0.98 for MO) are
both near to unity. We conclude that the Langmuir model best fits the experimental data.
The estimated values of the separation factor "RL" are always in an interval of 0 and 1. The results

Isosteric heat of adsorption

The isosteric heat of adsorption Qst (kJ.mol−1) is the amount of heat generated when one mole of
dye is absorbed by one gram of adsorbent. It was determined at constant amount of dye adsorbed (Qe
= 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 mg. g−1) and was calculated using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation given by the

Table 6 Isosteric heat of adsorption of MO and MG onto BiMgFeO4/activated carbon composite

The equilibrium concentration (Ce) of MO and MG at constant adsorption was obtained from
isothermal data at different temperatures. As shown in Figure 17, the plot of Ln Ce versus 1/T is
linear, and the ΔHads's value was determined from the slope. The ΔHads value and R2 for different
adsorption capacities have been summarized in the table above (Table 6).
The isosteric heat of adsorption may be used to describe the surface of adsorbents. Adsorbents are
homogeneous surfaces if their isosteric heat of adsorption is constant regardless of the amount of
adsorbate they adsorb, and heterogeneous if it fluctuates depending on the amount of adsorbate
adsorbed [65]. Adsorption capacity affected the isometric heat of adsorption when the composite
(BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) absorbed both dyes (MO and MG).Table 6 illustrates that ΔHads
decreases as adsorption capacity increases, suggesting that the adsorbent has a heterogeneous surface.
It is possible that lateral interactions between the adsorbed dye molecules, which could be followed by
adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, cause the variation in ΔHads regarding the amount of the two dyes
(MO and MG) on the composite [66].
The negative values for the isosteric heat of adsorption confirm the exothermic adsorption process.
Furthermore, the heat of physical adsorption, which involves only relatively weak intermolecular
forces such as van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, is low compared to that of chemisorption,
which essentially consists of the formation of chemical bonds between adsorbate molecules and the
adsorbent surface. For adsorption on adsorbents, the upper limit of Qst for physical adsorption, or
physisorption, should be 80 kJ mol-1. For chemical adsorption, or chemisorption, which is defined by
covalent bonding, it should be between 80 and 400 kJ mol-1 [67]. In the present work, isosteric heat of
adsorption values for methyl orange ranged from 3.046 to 2.602 kJ. mol-1, and from 3.647 to 2.961 kJ.

mol-1 for methyl green. The above results show that the interaction between the surface of the
composite (BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) and the molecules of the two dyes MO and MG is a
physisorption involving weak Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions.

Conclusion

The textile industry consumes vast quantities of water. Once discharged, they cause damage to the
aquatic environment due to their stable, highly toxic, and poorly biodegradable dye loads. The main
objective of the present research was to test the capacity of a new composite (BiMgFeO4/activated
carbon) for the adsorption of two dyes, anionic and cationic susceptible acid dyes, respectively methyl
orange and methyl green, which are present in textile industry wastewater .
Whatever the pollutant, the adsorption process is an easy-to-implement method that produces very
promising results for treating industrial water.
The research carried out has produced satisfactory results.The effect of factors related to operating
conditions, such as contact time, adsorbent dose, pH and temperature, has been examined. The
increased of the adsorbent mass led to an increase in the adsorption capacity of both dyes .
However, the percentage of MO decoloration in solution was higher, it reached 98.75 % for 150 mg
of composite in 100 mL solution, while it is 94.38% for the adsorption of MG with the same dose.
In addition, acidic pH was the optimum medium for best anionic MO adsorption, while basic pH was
the optimum medium for best cationic MG adsorption.
According to the kinetic analysis, the adsorption of both dyes using the composite
(BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) reached equilibrium after 120 minutes. Moreover, the adsorption
process of both dyes could be explained by pseudo-second order kinetics.
The adsorption isotherms confirm that the adsorption process of MO and Mg on the composite was
favorable. The Langmuir model is perfectly suited to the adsorption of the two dyes MO and MG on
the prepared composite, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.078 mg/g and 192.307 mg/g,
respectively, at 298 K. The n value of the Freundlich model is related to adsorption intensity and
surface heterogeneity. The coefficient n (n >1) indicates that adsorption is favorable for both dyes.
The mesoporous structure of the composite was also shown to be advantageous for the adsorption of
the MG cationic dye and the MO anionic dye. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the
adsorption of MG and MO was an exothermic process with a random distribution of dyes molecules
on the adsorbent surface.

The isosteric heat of adsorption for the prepared composite (BiMgFeO4/activated carbon) adsorbed
both dyes (MO and MG) suggests that it is an exothermic process and that it is indeed a physisorption
process characterized by low intermolecular forces between adsorbate and adsorbent. Adsorption
capacity had an impact on the isosteric heat of adsorption, indicating that the adsorbent has a
heterogeneous surface. The variation in ΔHads regarding the amount of dyes adsorbed on the composite
may be due to lateral interactions between the adsorbed dye molecules, followed by interactions
between the adsorbate and the adsorbent.
