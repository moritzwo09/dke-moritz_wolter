Abstract: The trihydrogen cation, H3+, is unique in the Universe. It serves as the primary proton reservoir, driving essential astrochemical reactions, and it functions as a thermostat for
giant gas planets. H3+ has also remarkably low photodissociation rate, explained by its exceptionally high first electronic excitation energy (19.3 eV). Herein we reveal the key factors behind this high energy: (i) aromatic stabilization in its electronic ground state, (ii) antiaromatic
destabilization in its first excited state, and (iii) a high nuclear-to-electronic charge ratio (+3
vs. -2). Through comparisons with analogous -conjugated carbocations, we find that ground
state aromatic stabilization plus excited state antiaromatic destabilization raise the excitation
energy of H3+ by 4.8 - 6.0 eV. Only with this increase can it fulfil its unique functions in space.

Triangular H3+ is the most abundant polyatomic ion in the interstellar medium, where it functions as the primary interstellar acid, initiating reactions that lead to more complex molecules
(Figure 1A).(1-3) It further acts as a thermostat (coolant) in the upper atmospheres of giant gas
planets,(4) and it has been postulated that it even could have functioned as a coolant in the
primordial gas (though with a different mechanism than in the giant gas planets).(5) With three
H atoms, it is the smallest molecule that exhibits aromaticity (-aromaticity),(6-9) a stabilizing
molecular property.(10)

gas planets ensuring that their temperatures do not exceed a threshold. (B) Tentative changes

The first vertically excited states of H3+, the doubly degenerate 11E′ at the equilateral
triangular structure (D3h symmetric), are of exceptionally high energy (19.3 eV)(11) and they
are dipole-allowed and dissociative.(12-14) Yet, despite this, astrochemical databases list a
photodissociation rate of 4 × 10−13 s−1 or lower,(13, 15) whereby it is among the species with
lowest photodissociation rates.(16, 17) The reason is that the much more abundant H and H2,
with ionization and excitation energies at 13.1 – 15.4 eV,(1, 18) shield H3+ from high-energy
irradiation in the interstellar medium (ISM).(12, 13, 19, 20) In the ISM, H3+ degrades unimolecularly only when exposed to electrons ejected from other molecules or atoms upon cosmic ray ionization.(1, 13) Indeed, direct photodissociation only occurs when H3+ is rovibrationally excited, whereby the electronic excitation energy decreases down to 4.9 eV.(12, 13)
Had it been more prone to photodissociate, this would have impaired its astrochemical and
astrophysical functions, and thus, been detrimental to the development of the Universe. However, the molecular origins of its very high vertical excitation energy are unknown and have
not been addressed earlier.
H3+ in S0 has a D3h symmetric structure (11, 21-23) with -aromatic character,(6-9) in
line with Hückel’s 4n+2 rule (n = 0, 1, 2…) as it has two -electrons. We now argue that the
concept of antiaromaticity (10) is crucial for the relative destabilization of its first excited states
(Figure 1B), and thus its excitation energy. In this context, the analogous cyclic and fully conjugated hydrocarbons (i.e., annulenes) in their lowest excited triplet states of * character
(T1) follow Baird’s rule.(24-28) This rule tells that molecules with 4n+2 -electrons are antiaromatic and destabilized in these states while those with 4n are aromatic and stabilized. Although derived for the T1 state, the rule can often be extended to the lowest * excited state of
singlet multiplicity (S1). Here we hypothesize that the exceptionally high excitation energy of
H3+ stems from such -antiaromatic destabilization in S1 (Figure 1B) combined with -

aromatic stabilization in S0, i.e., a switch in character from ground state Hückel-aromaticity
(GSA) to excited state Baird-antiaromaticity (ESAA), a GSA-to-ESAA switch (Figure 1B).
Herein, we investigated if the lowest excited states of H3+ are antiaromatic through quantum
chemical calculations of various (anti)aromaticity descriptors, and what impact that has on the
excitation energy. Computations were run at the EOM-CCSD level for all species, which for
H3+ corresponds to a full configuration interaction (FCI) calculation, i.e., a numerically exact
solution of the Schrödinger equation. For further computational details, see SI section S1.

Potential energy surfaces
According to our computations, the H−H distances of equilateral triangular H3+ in S0 are 0.875
Å (reference computed value: 0.873 Å (11)). The degenerate 11E states appear vertically 19.28
eV above the S0 state (Figure 2A and section S2), and the transition is symmetry allowed (f =
0.562). In C2v symmetry, the 11E′ states split into the 21A1 and 11B2 states (Figure 2B), where
21A1 as S1 dissociates to H2+ + H while 11B2 as S1 leads to 2 H(1s) + H+.(14) The first triplet
states (the degenerate 13E′) have vertical excitation energies of 14.87 eV (Table 1) and exhibit
similar dissociative behaviors as 11E. Lastly, the higher energy 11A2̋ state in D3h symmetry is
a dissociative second-order saddle point with H−H distances of 1.620 Å. As this state involves
an excitation from an a1 orbital to a nonbonding Rydberg-type orbital a2" (Figure 2A), only
one electron remains in a bonding molecular orbital (MO), which cannot counterbalance the
electrostatic repulsion between three protons. For further results and discussions on this state,
see Supplementary Information, sections S2 and S3.

Probing excited state antiaromaticity
The aromatic or antiaromatic characters of the various electronic states were determined by
energetic, electronic, and magnetic (anti)aromaticity descriptors (for details see SI section S3
or reference (10)). To measure electron delocalization,(29) we use the two-center delocalization index (DI)(30, 31) and the normalized multicenter index (MCI1/n)(32) that reflect the aromatic character. The magnetic response properties are explored by magnetically induced current densities (MICDs), and also by nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICSs). For details
on the aromaticity descriptors, see Supplementary Information sections S3 and S4.

Although assessed earlier,(6-9) the values for -aromaticity of the S0 state are discussed
briefly in order to contrast the antiaromatic character of the excited states (vide infra). H3+ has
two electrons and forms a 3-center 2-electron (3c-2e) bond both in its linear and triangular
structures. Therefore, the energy gain when going from the linear to the triangular structure
(1.76 eV) represents the extra cyclic resonance energy,(33, 34) reflecting an aromatic stabilization of cyclic H3+ in S0 (Figure 1). The topological analysis also reveals a species that benefits
from extensive 3c-2e bonding, manifested in the formation of a non-nuclear attractor (NNA)
in the center (Figure 3A), in agreement with previous works.(7, 8) Large DI values between
the hydrogen atoms and the large positive MCI1/n of 0.62 (Figure 3A)(35) are also consistent
with -aromaticity in S0 (the MCI1/n of benzene in S0 is 0.59 (36)). Finally, H3+ in its S0 state
displays a diatropic MICD of 4.39 nA/T, in agreement with the NICS(0)zz value of -37.1 ppm,
confirming the magnetic aromaticity of H3+ in S0.
Evaluation of the potential antiaromaticity in the 11E′ states of D3h symmetric H3+ is
more challenging, requiring separate characterizations of the two states, the 21A1 and 11B2
states in C2v symmetry. Going from the linear (Dh) to the triangular S0 state equilibrium geometry of H3+ results in a destabilization in the lowest vertically excited singlet states by 4.19
eV (Figure 3B). This reveals a negative extra cyclic resonance energy indicating antiaromaticity. Thus, the stabilization in S0 plus destabilization in 11E′ upon cyclization have implications
for the vertical excitation energy as this sum is 5.95 eV (Figure 3B). The corresponding sum
for the lowest triplet states is 7.50 eV. Both energies are in line with GSA-to-ESAA switches
in character upon vertical excitation (Figure 1B).

indicates distortions along an obtuse isosceles triangle formation (increasing the separation between H2 and H3).

With regard to the electron densities of these states and their Laplacians, they exhibit
significant differences from those of S0, which corroborates the loss of aromaticity upon excitation (Figure 3A). Despite the D3h symmetric geometry of H3+ in its vertically excited states,
the electron density distribution has lower symmetry as it shifts toward the outer part of the
atoms, preceding the dissociations that occur upon excitation to these states. Although the H
atoms are still covalently bonded, as indicated by the value of the DIs, the 21A1 and 11B2 states
exhibit drastic reductions of the three-center delocalization to 37 - 39% of the MCI value of S0
(Figure 3A). Similar conclusions can be reached on the antiaromaticity of the 13E′ (13A1 and
13B2) states based on the analysis of the electron delocalization in Figure S2.(35) Thus, the
MCI1/n values for H3+ (0.62 (S0), 0.46 and 0.45 (11E′), and 0.39 and 0.36 (13E′)), are comparable
to those of benzene in its S0, S1, and T1 states (0.59, 0.40, and 0.36, respectively).(36) This is
consistent with an aromatic S0 and antiaromatic lowest excited singlet and triplet states (11E′
and 13E′).
At the S0 state equilibrium geometry, the values of the magnetically induced ring current obtained for the vertically excited 11E′ states diverge as a result of the two-fold degeneracy
at D3h symmetry. The analysis of ring current strength at the C2v symmetric structures reveals
that the 11E′ states exhibit a pole in the ring current at D3h symmetric geometries (Figure 3C),
i.e., a sudden change from highly diatropic to highly paratropic values, which explains the
divergence observed at the vertical excitation. This resembles recent observations on the transient antiaromatic states of the c-C16 molecule where small bond length alterations lead to
changes from dia- to paratropicity, or vice versa,(38) related to the orbital degeneracies at
highly symmetric structures.(39) Now, by following the C2v symmetric dissociation paths of

H3+, and thus, the 21A1 and 11B2 states, we observe gradually diminishing paratropic ring currents (Figure 3C), in line with antiaromaticity relief. Also the NICS(0)zz values computed along
these paths reveal antiaromaticity, with values of 77.1 and 84.7 ppm at two C2v symmetric
structures distorted by a factor 1.5, leading to, respectively, acute and obtuse isosceles triangular structures as exemplified in Figure 2B (see further SI Section S3).

Protons-to-electrons ratios and impacts
Having established the antiaromaticity of the 11E′ states of H3+, the question is if the GSA-toESAA switch in character (Figure 1B) explains the unusually high vertical excitation energy
of this cation. From computations of light atoms, molecules and ions with only two electrons
such as He, Li+, HeH+ and He22+ (Table S3), we see that high vertical excitation energies are
characteristic of these species, which mostly cannot exhibit aromaticity as they are acyclic.
Many of these ions are also found in space, e.g., Li+ and HeH+.(40) Indeed, it has been argued
that HeH+ was the first molecule of the Universe,(41-43) and it produces H2+ upon collision
with atomic H, which in turn can produce H3+ in a reaction with H2.
The excitation energies are higher for more positively charged species, and is highest
when the protons are concentrated in one nucleus (He, Li+ and Be2+). Hence, in the 3p,2e series,
Li+ and HeH+ feature higher vertical E(S1) than H3+ by, respectively, 41.16 and 6.91 eV, and
similar for the vertical E(T1) (Table S3). For the 2e species He, Li+ and Be2+, with protons-toelectrons ratios of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, respectively, the first excitation energy goes up dramatically
from 20.94 eV to 60.44 eV and 121.26 eV as the excitation implies a gradually larger loss in
the electrostatic attraction between electrons and nuclei.
Now, to estimate the impact of the protons-to-electrons ratio on the excitation energies,
we explored the -conjugated and S0 aromatic cyclopropenium cation, c-C3H3+, which has an
equilateral triangular structure and a near-unit ratio of 1.05 between total nuclear and electronic

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-5nqfr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8076-1165 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

10

charges (+21 vs. -20) (SI sections S5 and S6).(44-46) Indeed, c-C3H3+ is isolobal with H3+, i.e.,
its -orbitals are analogous to the -orbitals of H3+.(47) Thus, it helps us decipher the relative
contributions of the protons-to-electrons ratio versus the GSA-to-ESAA switch to the 19.28 eV
excitation energy of H3+.
The vertical transition to the lowest ππ* states (11E") of c-C3H3+ requires 9.71 eV. This
is only half that of the transition to the * states of H3+ but significantly higher than the lowest
* states of any other -bonded hydrocarbon, e.g., 7.11 eV for ethylene.(48) Thus, c-C3H3+
has its lowest * states at an unusually high excitation energy despite its near-unit protonsto-electrons ratio. Therefore, the high excitation energy of the lowest * transition of c-C3H3+
is not caused by a drastically diminished electrostatic attraction upon excitation. Instead, it
should arise from the stabilization in the S0 state due to aromaticity plus destabilization in the
* states due to antiaromaticity, and this applies also to the lowest triplet states. From this
one can estimate that the additional energy (9.57 eV) to reach the excitation energy of H3+ is
caused by the electrostatic effect.

Comparisons to analogous carbocations
Further analysis of the c-C3H3+ cation, which also is of astrochemical importance,(49) enables
us to show that the very high first excitation energy of H3+ is due to both stabilization by GSA
plus destabilization by ESAA and the high protons-to-electrons ratio. The isomerization stabilization energy (ISE)(50) of c-C3H3+ in S0, computed as the reaction energy for the 1,3-hydrogen shift from a nonaromatic isomer to the S0 aromatic methylcyclopropenium cation (Figure
4A), is -2.03 eV with CCSD. This reveals a stronger aromatic character than that of benzene in
S0 (-1.34 eV with CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ). In contrast, the lowest vertically excited singlet and
triplet * states exhibit large positive ISE values of 2.66 and 2.78 eV with EOM-CCSD,

corresponding to strong excited state antiaromatic destabilization. Accordingly, the S0 stabilization plus excited state antiaromatic destabilizations of c-C3H3+ are 4.69 and 4.81 eV, respectively, and these should represent lower bounds for the analogous energies in H3+.

white.

A comparison of the linear H3+ with the allyl cation (H2CCHCH2+) allows for a second
assessment of the impact of the high protons-to-electrons ratio of H3+. The two species are
isolobal and nonaromatic in S0, yet have different protons-to-electrons counts (3:2 vs. 23:22).
For the allyl cation, with a near-unit protons-to-electrons ratio, the lowest vertical * singlet

state is found at 5.50 eV, while the first * excitation energy of linear H3+ is 13.33 eV, i.e.,
7.83 eV higher than that of the allyl cation. Both this and the excitation energy difference between c-C3H3+ and H3+ (9.57 eV) provide estimates of the electrostatic contribution to excitation energies of H3+ species.
Antiaromaticity assessments of c-C3H3+ in its first singlet excited * state reveal a
clear resemblance to H3+. The MCI values demonstrate their electronic structural similarities
with the values for, respectively, the 11E′ and 11E" states being less than half those of the S0
state (Figures 3 and 4B), and this is further emphasized by the topological analysis of their
excited state electronic structures (Figures 3A and 4B). Finally, the MICD of the cyclopropenium cation in its lowest * state reveals a paratropic (antiaromatic) ring current in the threemembered ring (Figure 4C), similar as for the two dissociation pathways of H3+ (Figure 3C).
Thus, c-C3H3+ like H3+, exhibit strong aromaticity in the S0 state and strong antiaromaticity in the lowest electronically excited states, yet the excitation energy of the latter is additionally affected by a high protons-to-electrons ratio. Indeed, by adding energy additives to the
lowest excitation energy of the acyclic and nonaromatic allyl cation (5.50 eV) one can estimate
the excitation energy of H3+. The energy for the GSA-to-ESAA switch in character in c-C3H3+
(4.69 eV) and the excitation energy difference between the allyl cation and linear H3+ or between triangular c-C3H3+ and H3+ (7.83 – 9.57 eV), as measures of the electrostatic energy loss
between protons and electrons upon excitation, added to 5.50 eV gives 18.0 – 19.8 eV. This
energy range brackets our computed first excitation energy of H3+ of 19.28 eV.

Conclusions
We decipher the energy contributors to the very high electronic excitation energy of H3+, which
enables its astrochemical and astrophysical functions, through a comparison of triangular H3+
with linear H3+ and two analogous -conjugated hydrocarbon ions, the cyclopropenium cation

(c-C3H3+) and allyl cation (CH2CHCH2+). Had the vertical excitation energy been lower, H3+
would have been more prone to photodissociate in space. We reveal that three factors are important; (i) the change from a stabilizing aromatic character to (ii) a destabilizing antiaromatic
character upon excitation from S0 to the lowest excited states (present also in c-C3H3+), and
(iii) the high ratio between total nuclear and electronic charges (present also in small cations).
These three factors together provide the origin of the astrophotochemical inertness of H3+.
Without this photostability H3+ could not have had the functions it has in the Universe. Indeed,
it would have led to a different Universe from the one we know.
We show for the first time that excited state antiaromaticity is a molecular electronic
structure property with crucial astrochemical influence that also has astrophysical implications.
In a broader sense, our findings point to the roles of excited state aromaticity and antiaromaticity as important new concepts for interpretation in astrochemistry. We anticipate that these
effects impact on a number of photochemical processes in space.
