Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) holds great potential in mitigating climate change. A promising approach
is redox sorbent-based electrochemically induced DAC, which operates at ambient conditions with
significantly lower energy costs while utilizing clean electricity. However, the oxygen sensitivity of
redox sorbents remains a major challenge. Thus, the feasibility of achieving electrochemically induced
DAC with redox sorbents remains uncertain. Despite the vast difference in partial pressures between
carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular oxygen (O2) in air, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate in plant leaves can
preferentially react with CO2 in the sunlight, thus achieving the net CO2 removal. Motivated by the
nature-based DAC solution, we hereby developed an aqueous-soluble oxygen-tolerant fluoflavine
disulfonate (FFDS) sorbent for DAC. Electrochemical characterizations, spectroscopic studies, along
with theoretical calculations, reveal that FFDS undergoes proton-coupled electron transfer and exhibits
a redox potential higher than the two-electron transfer oxygen reduction potential. When exposed to
simulated flue gas containing 10% O2, the FFDS sorbent demonstrates reversible CO2 capture and
release with an average CO2/e molar ratio of 0.88. Implemented for both indoor and outdoor DAC in
Singapore, FFDS sorbent shows stable cycling performance over 40 days with a three-day DAC under
the normal discharge-charge mode, and exhibits an enhanced CO2 capture capacity and a Coulombic
efficiency exceeding 99% with an accelerated overnight DAC under the deep discharge-charge mode.
Doubling the concentration of FFDS leads to a twofold increase in CO2 capture/release capacity,
regardless of whether the three-day DAC is conducted indoors or outdoors. The energy cost for CO2
release and sorbent regeneration ranges from 58 to 190 kJ mol–1 CO2, depending on the applied current
densities and discharge-charge modes.
Introduction
Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from point or diffuse sources is urgently needed to mitigate climate
change. Existing technologies, including amine scrubbing for point source capture[1] and hydroxidebased solutions[2] for direct air capture (DAC), rely on temperature-swing and require high energy input
for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release.
Potentially operating entirely on clean electricity, electrochemically induced CO2 capture approach
using redox sorbents offers a promising alternative to thermochemical methods, as the process enables
reversible CO2 release and sorbent regeneration under isothermal conditions by alternating
electrochemical potentials, significantly lowering energy costs.[3-9]
A number of electrochemically redox-active sorbents have been investigated in both aqueous[5, 6, 1016]
and nonaqueous[3, 17-25] media for reversible CO2 capture and release through nucleophilicity-swing
and/or pH-swing. Despite the promise of low energy cost and operating at ambient conditions, a key
challenge remains: the poor selectivity of sorbents for CO2 over molecular oxygen (O2).[15] This issue
arises because, after sorbent regeneration, the electrochemically reduced species are more likely to be

re-oxidized by O2, rather than capturing CO2 to form organic or inorganic carbonates, particularly when
exposed to ambient air.
Strategies including molecular engineering,[8, 21] electrolyte engineering,[3, 18-20, 23] and
electrochemical engineering[11] have been employed to address the O2 sensitivity issue of the redoxactive sorbents in their reduced state, leading to significant advancements in point source capture.
However, the inherent O2 sensitivity issue of the redox-active sorbents at the molecular level persists.
As a result, the viability of using redox-active sorbents for electrochemically induced DAC remains an
open question.
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBp) in plant leaves preferentially reacts with CO2 over O2 in the
sunlight, despite the orders of magnitude difference in partial pressures—0.4 mbar CO2 vs. 0.21 bar O2
in air.[26] Motivated by the capability of RuBp in carbon fixation through photosynthesis, we envision
the possibility of developing a redox-active sorbent capable of electrochemically induced DAC while
tolerating ambient oxygen.
Fluoflavine, an azaacene dye known for its intense fluorescence,[27, 28] has been used to facilitate
charge transfer in LiFePO4 and used as an electro-active material for energy storage.[29, 30] Our interest
in fluoflavine stems from its unique properties, including its air stability,[30] high pKa values,[31] and
excellent redox activity.[27] Through introducing water-solubilizing sulfonate groups to fluoflavine, we
developed an oxygen-tolerant aqueous-soluble fluoflavine disulfonate sorbent that can be
electrochemically induced to capture CO2 from simulated flue gas as well as indoor and outdoor ambient
air, with low energy cost, excellent reversibility, and high stability. The electrochemically induced CO2
capture system with aqueous redox-active sorbents inherits the merits of aqueous flow batteries,
including non-flammability, continuous-flow engineering, modularity, and the ability to operate at high
current densities. We demonstrated that increasing the applied current densities accelerates the CO2
capture–release rate, which is crucial in addressing the urgent challenge of climate change.

Both DAC solutions face a vast difference in partial pressures between O2 and CO2, 0.21 bar vs. 0.4
mbar. In the presence of light, RuBP and Rubisco preferentially react with CO2 over O2, promoting
photosynthesis over photorespiration. The redox-active sorbents used in the emerging electrochemically
induced DAC technology usually encounter an oxygen sensitivity issue and show poor selectivity for
CO2 over O2. Ideally, a redox-active sorbent Q (QH2), with inherent oxygen tolerance at molecular
level, would enable electrochemically induced carbon capture from the air, while greatly suppressing
the sorbent oxidative deactivation. Three steps are involved in Q/QH2 sorbent-based CO2 capture and

Results and discussion
Fluoflavine (FF) was synthesized through a condensation reaction.[30] After the one-step sulfonation
of FF, we obtained fluoflavine disulfonic acid (FFDS) with an outstanding yield of 94%. The
disulfonation of FF was confirmed by the mass-to-charge ratio obtained from high-resolution mass
spectrometry. The oxidized FFDS (ox. FFDS) was quantitatively obtained through a one-step
electrochemical oxidation. By analysing the splitting pattern and the ratio of peak integrals in the
aromatic regions of their 1H NMR spectra, we were able to determine the structure of FFDS and ox.
FFDS as drawn in Figure 2a, where the two sulfonate groups are attached to the separated phenyl rings
at the meta- or para-positions. The number of peaks in the 13C NMR spectra further validates the
proposed structures.

S1-S2 for more details.
The cyclic voltammograms of FFDS in buffered aqueous media exhibit reversible redox behaviour
over a pH range of 5.7 to 13.9 (Figure 3a). The Pourbaix diagram in Figure 3b indicates that the redox
potential of FFDS is negatively proportional to pH with a fitted slope of 59 mV/pH throughout the pH
range from 0 to 14. The overlap between the experimental reduction potentials of FFDS and the
theoretical values (Figure S10) further corroborates that FFDS undergoes two-proton, two-electron
transfer, i.e., proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), over the pH range of 0 to 14. It is worth noting
that the oxidation potentials of FFDS fall between the potentials of two-electron transfer oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) and four-electron transfer ORR (Figure 3b). Given that the four-electron
transfer ORR pathway is highly disfavoured in the absence of a catalyst, FFDS could potentially tolerate
ambient O2, thus enabling FFDS sorbent-based electrochemically induced DAC.
The electrochemically induced CO2 capture using FFDS was first examined in the absence of O2.
FFDS shows a reversible swing in both pH and potential while operating in N2 (Figure 3c). The
introduction of CO2 to the reduced electrolyte leads to a steep decline in pH and a sharp rise in potential,
which are attributed to the CO2 buffering effect (Figure 3d). A slight pH increase and potential drop
are observed after the CO2 feed gas is replaced by pure N2. Such a phenomenon can be explained by
the CO2 partial pressure drop in feed gas lowering the solubility of CO2 in liquid phase. Subsequent
oxidation of FFDS lowers the electrolyte pH from 9.5 to 4, accompanied by the CO2 release. The
replotted voltage profiles in Figure 3e clearly show that the oxidation potential of FFDS shifts to a
more positive value after CO2 capture. The integrated loop area in Figure 3f represents the energy
required for CO2 release and FFDS sorbent regeneration. With a one-hour exposure of pure CO2 at one

bar, the FFDS sorbent could release 43.10 mL CO2 after the electrochemical oxidation (Figure S5),
which corresponds to a CO2/e molar ratio of 0.97 and an energy cost of 32.97 kJ mol-1 CO2.

In light of the distinctive colours of the azaacene family[27, 28], we carried out spectroscopic studies
on FFDS at varied state of charge (SOC). Figure 4a shows that the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum of
FFDS evolves reversibly between 0% and 100% SOC, confirming the reversible redox behaviour.
Although the structural conjugation is extended from FFDS to ox. FFDS, the corresponding UV–Vis
spectral shift is insignificant, which has also been corroborated by the simulated results (Figure S7).
The lack of red shift can be attributed to the fact that the S0–S1 transition is forbidden due to the
substantial alternation in molecular symmetry caused by oxidation (Figure S8).
As implied by the name, fluorescence is an inherent feature of fluoflavine derivatives. The
fluorescence of FFDS linearly diminishes with the decrease of SOC (Figure 4b). The same linear
correlation has also been observed in the mixture of FFDS and ox. FFDS in varying ratios (Figure
S12). It is important to note that the quantitative relationship between fluorescence intensity and SOC
could be established via in-situ non-invasive fluorescence technique.[32] The almost non-fluorescent
feature shown by the ox. FFDS can also be attributed to the S0–S1 transition being forbidden. The
fluorescence of the ox. FFDS is effectively quenched by rapid internal conversion to the dark state (S1)
upon photoexcitation, as confirmed by the transient absorption measurements (Figure S13). The FFDS
solutions with and without captured CO2 show the same spectra of both UV-Vis absorbance and
fluorescence (Figure S11-S12), indicating that CO2 is captured as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
species that does not affect the structure of FFDS, validating that FFDS captures and releases CO2 via
pH-swing rather than nucleophilicity-swing.[5, 15]
The in-situ ATR-FTIR spectra of FFDS over the electrochemical reduction process in Figure 4c
show gradual transmittance variations at 1150-1200, 1600, 2900, and 3200-3300 cm-1, which
correspond to the stretching vibrations of C-N, C=N, N-H, and O-H bonds, respectively.[21, 33, 34]
During the reduction, the C=N bonds in one of the two pyrazine rings are converted to C-N and N-H
bonds, intensifying the absorption bands at 1150, 1200, and 2900 cm-1, weakening the C=N absorption
band at 1600 cm-1. The O-H vibration absorption in the range of 3200-3300 cm-1 diminishes, as water
molecules are consumed over reduction.

intensity vs. SOC (insert). c, Stacked in-situ IR transmittance spectra of FFDS over electrochemical

To assess the oxygen tolerance of FFDS, we measured the CO2 capture performance of FFDS
sorbent in a simulated flue gas consisting of 10% CO2, 10% O2, and 80% N2 at one bar. The simulated
flue gas is introduced to the FFDS electrolyte as the feed gas at a flow rate of 30 mL min–1. The flow
cell is charged to electrochemically reduce ox. FFDS, thereby regenerating the sorbent. The pH of the
sorbent first increases from 7.25 to 9.5, then decreases and stabilizes at 7.7 which is a result of the
acid-base reaction between the CO2 in the feed gas and the OH- generated via the PCET process.
Correspondingly, the CO2 flow rate becomes lower than 3 mL min–1; while the oxygen level becomes
higher than 10%. The acid-base reaction-induced CO2 capture continues after the charging process and
completes during the rest period. During the electrochemical oxidation of FFDS, the pH of the sorbent
first decreases from 7.7 to 6.6, then increases and stabilizes at 7.25. The corresponding CO2 release
leads to the increase of CO2 flow rate and the decrease of O2 level. The reversible alterations in voltage,
pH, O2 level, and CO2 capture flow rate over 11 cycles indicate the excellent oxygen tolerance of FFDS
in 0.1 bar O2 (Figure 5a). Being exposed to 0.1 bar O2 for 200-hour, 38-cycle CO2 capture and release,
the FFDS sorbent steadily releases CO2 at an average volume of 36.7 mL per cycle with an average
5

Coulombic efficiency of 99.02% (Figure 5b, Figure S20), indicating that FFDS possesses exclusive
selectivity of CO2 over O2, superior oxygen-tolerance, and excellent reversibility. The molar ratio of
CO2/e approaching 0.88 suggests that CO2 was primarily absorbed via the reaction of CO2 + OH- à
HCO3- during the capture process, which is also reflected by the stabilized pH at 7.7 after the completion
of CO2 capture. As shown in Figure S16, the DIC in water at pH 7.7 is primarily in the form of
bicarbonate.
It is worth noting that the aqueous electrochemical flow system is capable of operating at high
current densities, thus accelerating the CO2 release and sorbent regeneration, ultimately expediting the
DAC rate. Figure 5c shows the averaged volumes of CO2 capture-release over five cycles at varied
current densities. Increasing the applied current densities does not adversely lower the volumes of CO2
captured and released by the FFDS sorbent. Instead, it reduces the time required to complete the CO2
capture from 132 to 92 minutes when the applied current density increases from 20 to 40 mA cm–2
(Figure S21b). Further increasing the current density does not shorten the CO2 capture time, as the ratelimiting step becomes the acid-base chemical reaction between CO2 and OH–. Figure 5d shows that
the CO2 release peak intensifies with the increase of current densities, shortening the duration of CO2
capture–release cycle. Because CO2 release is coupled with electrochemical oxidation of FFDS,
increasing the applied current densities from 20 to 100 mA cm–2 reduces the time required to complete
CO2 release from 50 to 20 mins (Figure 5e). Figure 5f shows the comparable Coulombic efficiencies
of close to 100% and the increased energy cost for CO2 release and sorbent regeneration from 58 to 190
kJ mol–1 CO2 when the applied current density is increased from 20 to 100 mA cm–2.

Encouraged by the stable cycling of carbon capture and release in the simulated flue gas, we put 10
mL, 0.1 M FFDS sorbent in the indoor air and stirred it for three days. As such, we were able to evaluate
the outcome of the two competing reactions—carbon capture vs. oxidative deactivation of FFDS
(Figure 1) over an extended air exposure. Instead of releasing CO2 to a mixed gas containing 10% CO2
at ambient pressure (Figure 5), we employed pure N2 (99.9995%) as the carrier gas to avoid any further
unintended CO2 capture, as the sorbent after DAC would immediately continue to capture CO2 upon
being exposed to a feed gas containing 0.1 bar CO2, which ultimately leads to an overestimation in DAC
capacity and the CO2/e molar ratio. Figure 6b shows the charge-discharge voltage profile of FFDS
after the three-day DAC. A Coulombic efficiency of 87% suggests that most of FFDS remains intact
after the three-day indoor air exposure. 20.16 mL CO2 is released (Figure 6d), corresponding to a CO2/e
molar ratio of 0.51.
To assess the cycling stability of FFDS sorbent-based DAC and release, we conducted 10 cycles of
continuous three-day indoor DAC plus one-day CO2 release, as shown in Figure 6h. During the 40
days of operation, the FFDS sorbent releases 16.5-20.0 mL CO2 per cycle with a Coulombic efficiency
of 85-95% and an energy cost of 80-110 kJ mol–1 for CO2 release and sorbent regeneration. The
variation in the released CO2 volume is mainly attributed to sorbent loss or residual sorbent left behind
during transfer.
Although the significantly improved oxygen tolerance of FFDS enables us to capture CO2 from the
air, there is still 5-15% of FFDS being oxidized by molecular oxygen during the three-day air exposure,
as reflected by the Coulombic efficiency. As a result, part of the captured CO2 remains in the sorbent
solution. The remaining DIC creates a buffer solution that stabilizes its pH at 9.3 after CO2 release and
at 12.6 after the sorbent regeneration (Figure 6c). To confirm whether the DICs accumulate over
cycling, 1 M HCl was intentionally added to the cycled FFDS sorbent (Figure S24), and a total of 36
mL CO2 was released, validating our reasoning. However, the addition of hydrochloric acid adversely
introduces extra ions to the sorbent, which would compromise the aqueous solubility of FFDS.
Furthermore, the unbalanced charges over cycling will eventually outbalance the whole system.
To eliminate the influence of extra ions and rebalance the charges in the system,[11, 35] we further
lowered the discharge voltage to initiate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which was noted as deep
discharge. By controlling the deep discharge capacity, we improved the Coulombic efficiency close to
100% and increased the initial CO2 release volume up to 23.31 mL. With the controlled OER, we
lowered the pH to 4.0 after CO2 release to ensure that no HCO3- and CO32- were left in the sorbent
(Figure S16). The subsequent charge process elevates the sorbent pH up to 13.3. To accelerate the
DAC-release cycle, we kept bubbling the sorbent solution with the indoor air overnight at a flow rate
of 375 mL min–1 and stopped bubbling when the sorbent pH decreased to ~10. The whole DAC-release
cycle completes within one day. Figure 6i shows the cycling over 16 days with an average CO2 release
volume of 21.6 mL. The fluctuation in the volume of released CO2 was mainly due to the unavoidable
liquid splashes caused by air bubbling. Compared to the normal discharge, the deep discharge method
improves the Coulombic efficiency close to 100%, releases 3.2 mL more CO2, and rebalances the
system with 51% higher energy cost (Figure 6i vs. Figure 6h).
With the 0.2 M FFDS sorbent, we conducted both indoor and outdoor DAC in Singapore, a city
country near the equator with a tropical climate of high humidity and relatively consistent temperatures
year-round. Figure 6a presents the continuous 20-day indoor and outdoor temperatures, relative
humidity, oxygen, and CO2 levels of Singapore in Feb. 2025. The outdoor open air shows recurring
oscillations for all of the monitored parameters. Because of air conditioning, the indoor air is maintained
at relatively stable temperature, humidity, and O2 levels. The indoor CO2 fluctuation is due to the
activities of group members. Figure 6j presents the continuous cycling of FFDS sorbent for two cycles
of the three-day indoor DAC, and another two cycles of the three-day outdoor DAC. The FFDS sorbent
releases more than 46 mL CO2 after the three-day indoor and outdoor DAC, doubling the DAC capacity

as compared to the 0.1 M FFDS sorbent. The similar released CO2 volumes, Coulombic efficiency, and
energy cost indicate that the fluctuations in temperature and humidity levels of the outdoor air have
insignificant influence on the FFDS sorbent. It is noticed that the water loss from the FFDS sorbent
during the three-day outdoor DAC is 30%-50% less than that during the three-day indoor DAC. The
10% higher relative humidity in the outdoor air slows down the water evaporation of FFDS sorbent
during the three-day outdoor DAC (Figure 6a).

K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.07 M K3Fe(CN)6.
Depending on the discharge voltage cutoffs, FFDS-sorbent used for electrochemically induced DAC
exhibits an estimated energy cost range of 3.15-6.14 GJ tonne–1 CO2 when air contact, CO2 release,
sorbent regeneration, and pressurization are taken into consideration (Table S5), which is significantly
lower than the hydroxide solution-based thermochemical approach.[2] Furthermore, among the reported
technology-based DAC solutions operating at ambient pressure, the FFDS sorbent bears the lowest
energy cost for CO2 release and sorbent regeneration (Table S6).
Outlook
We developed an aqueous-soluble, oxygen-tolerant fluoflavine sorbent that can be electrochemically
induced to capture CO2 from simulated flue gas, as well as indoor and outdoor ambient air. Specifically,
we synthesized an aqueous soluble fluoflavine disulfonate FFDS in a one-step sulfonation with an
outstanding yield. Electrochemical characterizations, theoretical calculations, and spectroscopic studies
reveal that FFDS not only undergoes reversible two-proton, two-electron transfer, but also exhibits an
oxidation potential exceedingly higher than that of the two-electron transfer oxygen reduction reaction
across the entire pH range of 0 to 14, indicating that FFDS can potentially capture and release CO2 via
pH-swing in the presence of O2. In a one-bar simulated flue gas containing 10% CO2, 10% O2, and 80%
N2, the FFDS sorbent shows a reversible CO2 capture and release with an average CO2/e molar ratio of
0.88 and a Coulombic efficiency of >99% throughout 38 cycles and 200 hours. Besides, as the applied
current density increases, the discharge-induced CO2 release rate is substantially accelerated.
Throughout the 10-cycle three-day indoor DAC over the course of 40 days, FFDS shows an average
Coulombic efficiency of 90% via a normal discharge-charge process and releases 16.5-20.0 mL of
CO2. Instead of stirring the sorbent in the air for three days, we continuously passed ambient air through
the sorbent solution overnight to expedite the DAC process and implemented a deep discharge step to
fully release the captured CO2, achieving a steady DAC-CO2 release with an improved Coulombic
efficiency of ~99% over 16 cycles. The FFDS sorbent shows an inappreciable difference in its CO2
capture and release capacity between the indoor and outdoor DAC, in spite of the elevated and
fluctuating temperature and humidity levels outdoors in Singapore. The CO2 capture capacity increases
twofold when the concentration of FFDS is doubled, regardless of whether the DAC is conducted
indoors or outdoors. Molecular engineering could be employed to further improve the aqueous
solubility, structural stability, and oxygen tolerance of the fluoflavine derivatives. Electrochemical and
electrolyte optimizations would maximize the CO2 capture capacity, lower the energy cost, and expedite
the DAC rate at high current densities.

Methods
Synthesis of FFDS
Fluoflavine (51 mmol, 11.9 g) was added into 95% H2SO4 to afford a 0.5 M fluoflavine solution. The
reaction mixture was stirred at 150 °C for 18 hours. After cooling down, the acid solution was slowly
added into a 300 mL of ice water mixture. The resulting precipitate was then vacuum-filtered and
washed with ice water to remove residual H2SO4. The product was then dried in vacuo at 60 °C
overnight to afford the desired yellow product, fluoflavine disulfonic acid (FFDS), with a yield of 94%.

In situ Fourier transform infrared spectra were collected using an attenuated total reflectance infrared
spectroscopy (ATR-IR) instrument from Bruker Tensorll. Spectra were collected on the neat samples
at room temperature (around 25 °C). Spectra were plotted in transmittance (%) against the wavenumbers
(cm–1).
Fluorescence Emission Spectra
The fluorescence emissions of FFDS with different SOCs were measured with PerkinElmer FL-6500
fluorescence spectrometer. The source power is 40 kW and the frequency is 50 Hz. 255 nm was selected
as excitation wavelength with 2.5 nm excitation slit width and a scan rate of 240 nm min–1. 2.5 nm
emission slit width, 320 nm emission filter, and 240 nm min–1 scan rate were selected as emission
settings. The emission wavelength range was from 350 to 700 nm. 400 V was used as the
photomultiplier voltage for acquisition.
UV–Vis Absorption
The UV–Vis spectra of FFDS at different states of charge (SOCs) were collected from Shimadzu UV1900 UV–Vis spectrometer.
Flow cell setup
Flow cell experiments were constructed with the cell hardware from Fuel Cell Tech. The two
electrolytes are separated with a cation exchange membrane Nafion 117. The electrodes were 5 pieces
of baked carbon cloth on each side. Electrolytes was circulated by a peristaltic pump. A Lei-ci pH
electrode (E-301-QC) was implemented for monitoring the electrolyte pH. The mass flow controller
was a MFC-4200 (Siargo, Ltd.). CO2 data was recorded with 100% CO2 Sensor (SprintIR®-W CM0221), 5% CO2 Sensor (ExplorIR®-W CM-0124) and 1% CO2 Sensor (K30 CM-0024). O2 data was
recorded by 25% Oxygen Flow Through Sensor (LOX-O2-F UV Flux CM-42991). The downstream
CO2 reading (ppm) is monitored with CO2 sensors and recorded with the GasLab data logging software.
All electrochemical characterizations were conducted and recorded on a BioLogic VMP-300 instrument.
FFDS-based carbon capture and release in a simulated flue gas
The flow cell was galvanostatically charged and discharged at constant current densities followed with
potential holds until current density decreased to 2 mA cm–2. The charge process was followed by a
180-minute rest to complete CO2 capture. The discharge process was followed by a 90-minute rest to
complete CO2 release. The simulated flue gas composed of 10% CO2, 10% O2, and 80% N2 was used
as the feed gas. The total pressure of the feed gas was one bar, and the flow rate was 30 mL min–1.
Before being fed into the FFDS negolyte, the feed gas was first flowed through a deionized water
reservoir to be humidified to minimize the gas flow induced water loss over experiments. To avoid the
influence of humidity on the accuracy of sensor readings, a drying tube filled with blue silica gel
(Chemicon, 6–20 mesh) was installed before the downstream gas entered the gas sensors. CO2 data was
recorded by a 100% CO2 sensor. O2 data was recorded by a 25% O2 sensor.
FFDS sorbent-based three-day indoor/outdoor DAC, CO2 release, and regeneration
The 100% SOC FFDS sorbent was transferred to a 50 mL PTFE beaker equipped with a cylindrical stir
bar and being stirred in ambient air at a speed of 500 rpm for the three-day direct air capture (DAC),
both indoors and outdoors. After the three-day DAC, approximately 5–7 mL of water was added to
compensate for the evaporation-induced water losses. The pH of the FFDS sorbent decreased from the
initial 13.3 to ~10.2 after DAC. The CO2-captured FFDS sorbent was then transferred back to the
negolyte reservoir, and the flow cell was reconnected for discharge-induced CO2 release. Pure N2 served
as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 28 mL min–1. To minimize the evaporation-induced water losses in
the negolyte during the electrochemical measurements, N2 was humidified by flowing the gas through
a deionized water reservoir before being introduced to the FFDS negolyte. The N2 gas outlet was
positioned at the bottom of the FFDS negolyte to ensure that all of the released CO2 during the discharge
can be bubbled out from the negolyte and being detected by the CO2 sensor. To better measure the
volume of the released CO2, the CO2 flow rates before and after CO2 release should be approximated
to 0 mL min–1 to generate a baseline. We let N2 flow through the CO2 sensors for a while before initiating
the CO2 release and after the completion of the CO2 release.
The flow cell was discharged at 20 mA cm–2 followed by potential holds. –0.5 V was applied for normal
discharge until the current density decreased to 2 mA cm–2. –1.2 V was applied for deep discharge

until the pH of negolyte decreased to 4. The CO2 release process was considered complete when the 5%
CO2 sensor reading stabilized at ~200 ppm.
After the completion of CO2 release, the flow cell was charged in N2 to regenerate the FFDS sorbent at
20 mA cm–2 followed by a potential hold at 1.0 V until the current density decreased to 2 mA cm–2.
FFDS sorbent-based accelerated overnight DAC, CO2 release, and regeneration
Powered by an electric air pump, the ambient air was pumped through a deionized water reservoir to be
humidified, before being introduced into the FFDS sorbent through a PTFE tube (Æ3.2 mm). As such,
the water loss induced by the rapid gas flow can be significantly minimized. The air outlet was
positioned at the bottom of the FFDS sorbent to increase the air-liquid interface for sufficient CO2
capture. The air flow rate was regulated at 375 mL min–1 with a mass flow controller (Siargo, Ltd. MFC4200). With such a high flow rate, the whole DAC process was greatly accelerated. The pH of the FFDS
sorbent decreased from 13.3 to around 10.0 after the overnight air bubbling. To avoid the influence of
humidity on the accuracy of sensor readings, a drying tube filled with blue silica gel was installed before
the downstream gas entered the gas sensors. The CO2 reading during the accelerated overnight DAC
was recorded with the 1% CO2 sensor. After the accelerated overnight DAC, the air was replaced by N2
at a flow rate of 28 mL min–1. Serving as the carrier gas, N2 flowed through the FFDS negolyte for 30
minutes to generate a baseline of CO2 level at ~200 ppm before discharge process. The flow cell was
discharged at 20 mA cm–2 until the voltage approached the pre-set cutoffs. A potential hold at –0.5 V
was applied for normal discharge until the current density decreased to 2 mA cm–2. A potential hold at
–1.2 V was applied for deep discharge until the pH of the negolyte dropped to 4. The CO2 release was
considered complete when the CO2 sensor reading stabilized at ~200 ppm.
The flow cell was charged in N2 to regenerate the FFDS sorbent at 20 mA cm–2 followed by a potential
hold at 1.0 V until the current density decreased to 2 mA cm–2.
