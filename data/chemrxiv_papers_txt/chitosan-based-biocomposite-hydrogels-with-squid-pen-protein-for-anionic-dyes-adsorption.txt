ABSTRACT: Growing environmental concerns have spurred the search for sustainable solutions to water pollution, particularly focusing on the removal of persistent synthetic dyes from wastewater. Hydrogels, known for their water-absorbing capabilities, have emerged as promising materials for such applications. This study investigates the use of squid pen protein
(SPP) and chitosan, two biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, in fabricating hydrogels for effective anionic dye removal. SPP, derived from squid pen is a marine waste product and a sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic polymers.
When combined with chitosan, extracted from crustacean exoskeletons, the resulting hydrogels demonstrate enhanced dye
sorption properties due to the complementary characteristics of the two materials. The study focuses on synthesizing and
characterizing SPP-chitosan hydrogels, assessing their effectiveness in removing reactive blue 4 (RB4) and methyl orange
(MO) dyes from aqueous solutions. The hydrogels achieved a maximum swelling ratio of 140.7%, with adsorption capacities
of 153.85 mg/g for RB4 and 60.24 mg/g for MO. These results were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, providing insights into the functional groups and surface structures involved in the dye removal process. The study also highlights that a higher crosslinker content negatively impacts
adsorption performance by reducing the availability of binding sites on the protein and chitosan. The combination of SPP with
chitosan potentially presents a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable alternative for wastewater treatment, offering
a promising solution for mitigating water pollution through sustainable materials.

In the wake of escalating environmental concerns, the
quest for sustainable and eco-friendly solutions to water
pollution has intensified (1). Among the myriad pollutants,
synthetic dyes pose a significant challenge due to their persistence and adverse effects on ecosystems and human
health (2). Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative approaches that not only efficiently remove dyes from
wastewater but also adhere to principles of environmental
sustainability.
Hydrogels, three-dimensional networks capable of absorbing and retaining large volumes of water or aqueous solutions, have emerged as promising materials for
wastewater treatment (2,3). Given the tunable properties of
hydrogels, these are attractive candidates for environmental remediation applications. Particularly, the synthesis of
biocomposites offers a compelling avenue for designing hydrogels with enhanced functionality for dye removal due to
the biocompatibility and biodegradability of hydrogels (4).
In this study, we explore the synergistic potential of squid
pen protein (SPP) and chitosan, two biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, in the fabrication of hydrogels tailored for the removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solutions. Squid pen protein (SPP), a promising stream extracted from squid pen, is readily available and an inexpensive marine waste composed of mainly 75wt% protein and

25wt% chitin (5). It offers a sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic polymers. When combined with chitosan,
derived from the exoskeletons of crustaceans, the resulting
hydrogels exhibit promising characteristics for dye sorption, owing to the complementary properties of the constituent polymers (2).
The rationale behind this approach stems from the imperative to harness natural resources efficiently while mitigating the environmental footprint of wastewater treatment
processes. Squid pen can be used to produce chitosan and
the protein is extracted from the pen with alkaline solutions
that become wastewater, which negatively impact the process and the environment (6). By leveraging the unique
amino acid functionalities of SPP and the structural integrity of chitosan-based materials, we aim to develop hydrogels that not only demonstrate superior dye removal efficiency but also align with the principles of green chemistry
and circular economy. Additionally, chitosan cost can be as
high as 200 USD per kg (25), and with up to 50wt% of chitosan being substituted by an inexpensive squid waste and
outperforming the pure chitosan hydrogels, we can upscale
squid waste utilisation in a more economically feasible
manner.

This paper delineates the synthesis and characterization
of SPP-chitosan hydrogels and investigates their efficacy in
removing the anionic dyes reactive blue 4 (RB4) and methyl
orange (MO) (structures shown in Fig S1 and S2 in ESI) from
aqueous solutions. Through a systematic analysis of the
physicochemical properties and dye sorption kinetics of the
hydrogels, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the dye removal process. Furthermore, we discuss
the implications of our findings in the context of sustainable
wastewater treatment strategies and outline potential avenues for future research.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We produced the biocomposite hydrogels by homogenizing both the SPP and chitosan in diluted acetic acid, then, a
certain amount of the crosslinker, glutaraldehyde, was
added. The final solution was then freeze-dried to yield a
spongy-foamy hydrogel that later was hydrated for the dye
adsorption experiments. The complete synthesis procedure
of the hydrogels are described in the ESI.
We employed design of experiments (DOE) to identify the
optimal combination of component concentrations to produce hydrogels with superior dye adsorption capacity and
physical attributes. For the synthesis of the SPP hydrogels,
11 different experiments were conducted consisting of 8
runs and 3 centre point replicates. The chitosan to protein
percentage ratio, X1, ranged from 50 to 70 wt%; the crosslinking percentage content, X2, from 1 to 3 wt%; and the total solids loading, X3, from 1 to 5 wt%. The complete experimental matrix is shown in table S1 (ESI). The samples were
named after the DoE factors: X1_X2_X3, for instance, a sample with chitosan to protein ratio, X1, of 70%, crosslinker
percentage, X2, of 2% and total solid loading, X3, of 5% will
be named sample 70_2_5. To validate the contributions of
the added proteins to enhance adsorption capacity and
physical strength, hydrogels with only chitosan were also
prepared. Their formulation included a solid loading of 3%
chitosan and 2% crosslinker, reflecting the center points
from the DOE.
Once manufactured, the hydrogels underwent various
tests to evaluate the effects of the selected variables and
their combinations on the characteristics and capacities of
the hydrogels. These tests included mechanical strength,
physical stability, water swelling ratio, and dye adsorption
capacity. The complete characterization procedure of the
gels is described in the ESI.
3.1. Water absorption capacity
The chitosan hydrogels (CH-1, CH-2, and CH-3) exhibited
an average swelling of 110.7%. In contrast, the squid pen
protein hydrogels (60_2_3, 70_3_50, and 70_3_51) demonstrated average swelling of 139.7 wt%. This increase in absorption capacity is attributed to the addition of each protein, which enhances the desirability as adsorbents of the
hydrogels.
Moreover, it was observed that the solid loading significantly affects the swelling for both squid pen and BSG protein hydrogels. The squid pen protein hydrogels with a 5%
solid loading (70_3_5, 70_1_5, 50_3_5, and 50_1_5) and a 1%

solid loading (70_3_1, 70_1_1, 50_3_1, and 50_1_1) exhibited
average swelling of 140.7% and 71.7%, respectively. Overall, the protein-containing hydrogels with the lowest solid
loading exhibited inferior results compared to even the chitosan hydrogels, indicating that this composition does not
yield valuable and efficient hydrogels in terms of absorption
capacity.
Furthermore, standard chitosan and acetic acid hydrogels
have a water absorption capacity range of 90-600%, depending on the additional materials included in the formulation (7). In a study by (8) with chitosan-graft-poly(acrylic
acid), synthesize gels had up to 160 wt% swelling. (9) and
also water absorption capacities of up to 475 wt% for chitosan hydrogels with blue crab protein. Given this range,
the values obtained for the BSG and SP protein hydrogels
were relatively low, possibly due to the presence of GLA in
the formulation. Although GLA can provide increased stability, the dense network formed within the hydrogel can restrict the entry of water molecules, thereby reducing water
absorption capacities.
3.2. Physical integrity of hydrogels
Both before and after the swelling stage, the physical stability of the hydrogels was evaluated. Hydrogels with a 5%
solid loading (70_3_5, 70_1_5, 50_3_5, and 50_1_5), as well
as the center point samples (60_2_3) and the pure chitosan
gels (CH-1, CH-2, and CH-3), demonstrated the most promising results in terms of mechanical integrity . During preparation, these gels formed a highly viscous, gel-like mixture
upon the addition of both chitosan and crosslinker, indicating that the gelation point had been reached. This was attributed to the formation of a three-dimensional network
structure within the hydrogel.
After lyophilization, these gels exhibited a styrofoam-like
consistency (Fig. SX in the ESI). The gels were extremely
lightweight and rigid, retaining shape under minimal pressure. However, the gels displayed limited elasticity, resulting in permanent cracks and indentations when subjected
to higher pressure.
Once hydrated, these gels had a sponge-like consistency
due to high porosity and visual texture (Fig. SX in the ESI),
although the gels were slightly dense. High porosity is a desirable characteristic for adsorbents due to the increased
surface area. Nevertheless, the gels were not soft and compressible, as such did not revert to original shape when
heavily compressed. Despite this, the three-dimensional
network structure of these hydrogels showed promising results in terms of physical stability, potentially enabling them
to withstand adsorption capacity tests.
In contrast, hydrogels with a 1% solid loading (70_3_1,
70_1_1, 50_3_1, and 50_1_1) remained as slightly viscous
liquids even after the addition of chitosan and crosslinker,
indicating that the gelation point was not reached. The incomplete formation of the three-dimensional network
could be due to the low percentage of solids in the gels. After
lyophilization, these gels exhibited significantly low porosity, yet were lightweight, soft, and highly compressible.
Once hydrated, these hydrogels barely maintained shape,
displaying slimy and mucilaginous properties. Such characteristics are undesirable for conducting adsorption tests

due to the potential dissolution of the hydrogels when introduced into dye solutions.
Based on these findings regarding the physical stability
and properties of the hydrogels, in conjunction with the water absorption capacity results, it was decided to eliminate
the following hydrogels from the dye adsorption efficiency
tests: 70_3_1, 70_1_1, 50_3_1, and 50_1_1.
3.3. Dye adsorption capacity and removal efficiency
Following the first elimination stage where water absorption capacity and physical stability of the hydrogels were
considered, the dye adsorption capacity of the hydrogels
was then evaluated with RB4 and MO solutions. These two
anionic dyes were selected due to the structure (dichlorotriazine and azo dye) and utilization, serving as these relevant model molecules for dye adsorption (10,11). The results obtained during adsorption capacity and removal efficiency tests for the selected hydrogels, and with a 100 ppm
RB4 solution, are presented in Table 1.

The addition of SPP resulted in superior adsorbance performance for both dyes, with samples 70_1_5 and 50_1_5
displaying nearly total removal efficiencies, of 98% and 99%
for RB4, and 70% and 56% for MO, respectively. As mentioned prior, these two hydrogels presented the lowest concentration of crosslinker (1 wt%) during synthesis. Therefore, the availability of nucleophilic sites in both SPP and
chitosan is higher to bind to the dyes. Qe values also correlated to the removal efficiencies with maximum values of 46
mg of RB4/g for and 55 mg of MO/g of hydrogel 70_1_5.
The SPP-chitosan hydrogels were more interactive towards RB4 compared to MO, this could be explained by the
fact that reactive dyes present moieties that can potentially
covalently bind to the adsorbent active sites. For instance,
the dichlorotriazine moiety can be attacked by nucleophilic
groups in the biocomposite hydrogels (12,13). MO, on the

other hand, shares only the aromatic moieties and the sulfonate group for dye-adsorbent interactions.
3.3.3. Zeta potential and hydrogel selection
To further understand the difference in the hydrogels reactivity toward the dyes, the zeta potential (ζ) of both dyes
was investigated. Additionally, the zeta potential of chitosan
and SPP were also analysed and compared to understand
the positive contribution provided by the squid pen protein
to the adsorbents.
Zeta potential compares the difference between the surface potential of a particle to the potential of the liquid it is
dispersed in. Therefore, this representation of surface
change is useful when investigating how the dispersed particles interact with other surfaces (14).
The zeta potential values obtained were the following: for
chitosan ζ= +14.85 mV, for squid pen protein ζ= +26.64 mV,
for RB4 ζ= -16.32 mV, and for MO ζ= -39.79 mV.
Chitosan is a polycation, with the amino groups which can
be easily protonated. Hence, it presents positive zeta potential values when dispersed that facilitate the adsorption of
the dyes, which are negatively charged. In a study by
Athavale et al. (2022) (15), the zeta potential values of chitosan nanoparticles produced were e between 12-25 mV,
similar values to the values s obtained in this work.
The fact that SPP had a positive zeta potential in DI water
means that the protein likely contained residual hydrochloric acid from the isoelectric precipitation. Protein isolates
normally present positive zeta potential at low pH (2-4) and
negative values at high pH (above 6) (16). Notably, the magnitude of SPP zeta potential was higher than the chitosan.
The increase in surface charge resulted in stronger interactions between the hydrogel and dyes, and therefore higher
adsorption capacity and dye removal efficiency results (15).
Both anionic dyes presented negative zeta potential values, which partly explains the efficacy of the biocomposites
hydrogels and the dyes in terms of electrostatic interactions. Both dye molecules present sulphonic acid groups
and therefore, their pKa is below 7. MO’s pKa is 3.42, and
RB4’s first pKa is 0.8 (17)), which means that in DI water
these molecules should be negatively charged. MO, however, presented relatively higher magnitude of zeta potential values, which suggest greater removal efficiency. Regarding such apparent discrepancy, it is also worth noting
that while intermolecular and covalent bonds that can also
play a role in the adsorption. RB4, as previously stated, can
covalently bind to the adsorbent, which may explain the
higher adsorption values.
Considering the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency results for both RB4 and MO solutions and the zeta
potential values of the adsorbent components and dyes,
both dyes were chosen as the probe dye for the adsorption
isotherms. Additionally, hydrogels 70_1_5 and 50_1_5 were
selected for adsorption isotherm analysis due to the superior performance of these formulations.
3.4. Adsorption isotherms
To characterize the adsorption behavior of samples
70_1_5 and 50_1_5 with both RB4 and MO solutions,

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-69zhl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5806-0856 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

respective adsorption isotherms, based on Langmuir theory, were determined and analyzed. By plotting the experimentally obtained data of Ce and qe according to the Langmuir model, Figures 1(a), (b), (c), and (d) were generated.
Using the data from these plots and Equation (6), the Langmuir constants, KL and αL, were calculated. The linearity of
each plot was evaluated based on the R² value of each trendline, which were 0.9762, 0.9685, 0.9875, and 0.9499 for Figures 1(a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively.

The calculated qmax values for the experiments RB4–
70_1_5, RB4–50_1_5, MO–70_1_5, and MO–50_1_5, which
were 153.85, 151.52, 60.24, and 54.94 mg/g, respectively.
These qmax values for RB4 were superior to studies that also
entailed producing bioadsorbents such as pure chitosan
beads, qmax 1.56 mg/g, a chitosan and hydroxyapatite biocomposites, qmax 118.4, and 100% deacetylated chitosan,
qmax 54.01. However, these were still inferior to studies that
derivatised chitosan such as the works by(19–21). Regarding MO, similar trends were observed with underivatised
chitosan hydrogels, qmax 10.53 and 12.46 mg/g in studies
performed by (22,23), respectively. Whereas with modified
chitosan biomaterials, such as the one produced by Chen et
al. (2023) (24) with a cerium-based metal organic framework chitosan polyimine biocomposites, of qmax 900 mg/g.
3.5. Hydrogel characterisation
The samples’ 70_1_5 and 50_1_5 chemical structure and
surfaces were then characterised through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, optical microscopy and
scanning electron microscopy imaging.

Figure 1. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms for 24 h
treatment. (a) RB4 adsorption by hydrogel 70_1_5. (b) RB4
adsorption by hydrogel 50_1_5. (c) MO adsorption by hydrogel 70_1_5. (d) MO adsorption by 50_1_5 (e)Langmuir
isotherms
Through the linearization of the experimental data, it was
possible to plot the adsorption isotherms, following Langmuir theory, for both 70_1_5 and 50_1_5, with RB4 and MO
solutions, as illustrated in Figure 1(e). The substantial adsorption capacity of both samples is evident in Figure 2,
characterized by the sharp and steep initial increase, followed by a complete monolayer formation indicated by the
plateau of each plot. In a work by Galan et al. (2021) (18) on
the adsorption of RB4 with chitosan beads crosslinked with
glutaraldehyde, a Freundlich isotherm was deemed as best
linear fit for the adsorption process. This model posits that
instead of a monolayer formation, there is a heterogeneous
distribution of the active sites on the surfaces of the chitosan beads. Additionally, in a study by Zhai et al. (2017) on
the adsorption of MO with chitosan microspheres (11), t the
Langmuir model better described their adsorption process,
which indicates similar behaviour to this work.

3.5.1. FT-IR spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of dry hydrogels 70_1_5 and 50_1_5, illustrated in Figure 2a, show that both samples have the
same absorption bands due to same composition. The most
significant absorption bands were found at 3251, 2866,
2102, 1635, 1521, 1399, 1375, 1248, 1151, 1062, 1017 and
889 cm-1, which were further characterised in Table 2 (ESI).
Specifically, the amide I C=O stretching at 1635 cm-1 and the
amide II N‒H bending at 1511 cm-1 and the C‒O‒C and C‒O
stretching between 950-1200 cm-1 were also present, which
are functional groups highly abundant in proteins, as also
found in previous work. (26). Even though similar, it can be
noticed that sample 70_1_5 presents higher intensity on the
bands at 3251, 1635 and 1521 cm-1 which correspond to the
higher content of chitosan. After RB4 dye adsorption, the
spectra of dry 70_1_5 and 50_1_5 hydrogels were compared
to the original spectra, as well as the RB4 powder spectra, it
was hard to spot the absorption bands of the dye due to the
poor absorbance of the material.
3.5.2. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM images of chitosan and hydrogel 50_1_5 are shown
in Figure 2c and 2d. The surface of the chitosan hydrogel
appeared rough and was composed of several microparticles of chitosan. On the other hand, the surface of the 50_1_5
hydrogel although still rough, seemed to be more homogeneously distributed, and the microparticles could not be distinguished. Images of samples 70_1_5 and 50_1_5 were
taken before and after dye adsorption, with two different
objective lenses to analyse the surfaces at various levels of
detail. The presence of pores, ridges, and surface texture are
crucial characteristics of an adsorbent since these provide a
larger surface area. This therefore indicates that the hydrogel contains more binding sites for the dye molecules to adhere to, resulting in superior adsorption capacity. Previously, the roughness of bio polymer-based hydrogels was
also observed with chitosan and gelatin hydrogels (27,28).

Optical microscopy images in Figure 2e and 2f show the
presence of bubbles entrapped in the hydrogel’s matrix,
which can help to increase hydrogel their ential site adsorption.

4. Conclusion
We produced biobased composites comprised of chitosan
and squid pen protein. Chitosan was the structural matrix
in which the squid protein pen protein was embedded . The
functionality from the amino acid residues enhanced the extraction of two anionic dyes, RB4 and MO, with dye removal
efficiencies of up to 99%. Higher crosslinker content negatively affected the adsorption performance due to the loss
of potential binding nucleophilic sites from both the protein
and chitosan. The combination of an alternative and cheap
protein with chitosan into hydrogels paves the path for a
more economically feasible wastewater treatment option.
