Abstract
Anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants pose a pressing threat to the environment and
human health. They can be found in water bodies all around the world at low but hazardous
concentrations. Typical representatives of this contaminant class are polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs). Here, we present nanoparticulate core-shell water cleaning agents, which are able to
remove PCBs of various chlorination degree from water. The core consists of
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) providing large surface area that can be
tuned via self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) composed of phosphonic acid derivates. This
shell binds the pollutants non-covalently enabling facile magnetic water remediation. By
employing positively charged or hydrophobic SAMs different PCBs can be preferentially
removed. Furthermore, these orthogonal functionalities can be integrated in one SPION
system. By combining charged and hydrophobic phosphonic acid derivates in so-called binary
SAMs the removal preference can be convoluted, which works just as well in real river water.
The cost-efficient availability of the base materials for these tailorable nanoparticles is
complemented with recyclability laying the foundation for a sustainable water cleaning
process.

Introduction
According to the United Nations Environment Programme persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
– despite being known for decades – are an increasing threat to humankind.1 They include
anthropogenic molecules that, once entered, remain in the environment for a long time and get
distributed around the world. Due to their hydrophobicity they accumulate in living organisms
while being toxic not only to wildlife but also to us humans.2,3 For this reason the Stockholm
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants or short just Stockholm Convention hosted by the
United Nations was put into action in 2004 as an international measure against POPs.4 Among
the twelve initial pollutants of concern are the so-called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
Consisting of two phenyl rings, which can be chlorinated at up to ten positions, they form a
group of 209 congeners typically occurring in mixtures. Due to their chemical stability,
temperature resistance and dielectric properties they had been widely used, for example, in
closed electrical equipment but also openly as plasticizers in polymers and paints.5,6 It was
estimated that between 1 and 1.5 million tons of PCBs were produced worldwide since the
1920s until being mostly banned in the 1980s and 90s.7 Because of improper discharge and
high environmental mobility, they are not only found around urban industrialized places like
Munich in Germany,8 the San Francisco Bay in the United States9 or megalopolises in China,10
but also in more rural areas like the Himalayan riverine network in Pakistan11 or down at the
Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean.12 The omnipresence is particularly concerning as it is
known that PCBs negatively influence early childhood development13,14 and are declared
carcinogenic15 among other harmful effects.16 In the river Nile in Egypt concentrations of PCBs
between 14 and 20 µg L-1 were measured17, while the United States Environmental Protection
Agency enforces a maximum contaminant level of 0.5 µg L-1 with the declared goal of zero
residues in their national primary drinking water regulations.18 In fact, the Stockholm
Convention set the sophisticated aim of complete and environmentally-friendly elimination of
PCBs until 2028 to obey the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.19
Therefore, it is necessary to efficiently clean waste water from PCBs at very low
concentrations, so-called trace concentrations. In Germany more than 96 % of waste water is
treated by conventional waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), which typically consist of a
mechanical, a biological and a precipitation stage.20 However, even state-of-the-art WWTPs
having an additional fourth stage comprised of oxidation via ozonation and/or activated carbon
filters cannot remove all trace contaminants sufficiently.21 Consequently, advanced water
cleaning is an active field of research. One way to classify approaches is by their biological,

chemical and physical (or combined) nature.22–24 Microbial remediation of PCBs, i.e.,
degradation by microorganisms like A. xylosoxidans,25 is a low energy-consuming and
environmentally-friendly approach. However, it takes long time and works less effective for
stable chlorination at ortho-positions on the phenyl rings.24 Therefore, oxidation processes like
the aforementioned ozonation or treatment with Fenton’s reagent (Fe2+/H2O2)26 as well as
dechlorination by reduction as shown with zero-valent iron27 provide more versatile
degradation strength. Here, cost and environmental impact of the treatment itself are the issues
of concern.23 Next to membrane filtration, which is inherently limited for large water volumes,
POPs-attractive adsorbents providing large surface areas resemble a simple and cost-effective
concept.28 As mentioned before, activated carbon is one of the most studied and already
employed adsorbents for water remediation today providing high surface area but typedependent PCB adsorption efficiencies.21,29,30 Therefore, costly modification processes are
necessary to target specific pollutants.31 Another elegant approach is to use superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), known for their theranostic medical applications32 or as
precursors for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts,33,34 as adsorbents to enable removal from the water
phase by applying a magnetic field gradient.28 Examples show SPIONs coated with complex
molecules like β-cyclodextrins35 or tediously synthesized polymeric shells36 to make them
attractive for PCBs.
Here, we present ton-scale produced SPIONs coated with PCB-attractive self-assembled
monolayers (SAMs) consisting of simple, commercially available and strongly binding
phosphonic acid derivates. Comparable core-shell SPION systems have previously been shown
to be not only non-toxic,37,38 but also very efficient for removing a broad range of simple
hydrocarbons,39,40 charged dyes41 as well as micro- and nanoplastics of various sizes from
water.38,42 As Figure 1 a) illustrates, the via molecular self-assembly functionalized
nanoparticles can be added to aqueous PCB solutions so that the large functional surface can
interact non-covalently with the pollutants. The superparamagnetism of the cores enables facile
magnetic PCB extraction from the aqueous solution, which is quantified by washing the
contaminant carrying SPIONs in hexane and analyzing the PCB concentration via gas
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Representative for the 209
congeners, non-chlorinated 1,1’-biphenyl (biphenyl), once-chlorinated 3-chloro-1,1’-biphenyl
(PCB 2), twice-chlorinated 3,5-dichloro-1,1’-biphenyl (PCB 14) and four times-chlorinated
3,3’,4,4’-tetrachloro-1,1’-biphenyl (PCB 77) are removed individually, but also competitively
in mixtures in dependence of the functional surface of the SPIONs (see Figure 1 b) ).

Figure 1: Schematic approach of magnetically removing PCBs from water via surfacefunctionalized SPIONs. a) An aqueous PCB solution i) is treated with functionalized SPIONs, onto
which the contaminants adsorb ii). The SPIONs can be magnetically collected carrying the PCBs iii).
b) Scope of investigated PCBs (Biphenyl, PCB 2, PCB 14 and PCB 77) as well as SPION surface
modifications (PAC16, PAC10Ph, PAC3Imi+, PAC3Imi+/PAC16 and PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph) tailored to
address the PCBs non-covalently. The electrostatic potential maps were calculated for electron density
isovalue surfaces as described in the supplementary information and range from -0.8 V (blue) to +0.8 V
(red) for all molecules except PAC3Imi+ where red indicates +5.3 V.

The SPION surface is complementary decorated with three different phosphonic acid derivates
to address the PCBs. 1-Methyl-3-(propylphosphonic acid) imidazolium bromide (simplified as
the cation only PAC3Imi+) is used to provide positive charges on the SPION surface for
attractive electrostatic interactions with the electronegative chlorine atoms. On the other hand,
n-hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16) and 10-phenyldecylphosphonic acid (PAC10Ph) provide
hydrophobic interaction sites combined with, in the latter case, an additional electron-rich
phenyl ring to interact with the electron-deficient rings of the chlorinated pollutants. The
electronic properties of the molecules are featured in Figure 1 b) by means of electrostatic
potential maps, which were calculated by density functional theory (see supplementary
information). In suitable contaminant-to-SPION ratios that enable quantitative comparison
between the systems, preferred interaction of biphenyl, PCB 2 and PCB 14 with hydrophobic
PAC16@SPIONs and PAC10Ph@SPIONs is shown, while PCB 77 – despite being less water
soluble than the other pollutants43 – is more efficiently extracted by the positively charged

PAC3Imi+@SPIONs. Moreover, these orthogonal surface functionalities can be combined on
the SPION surface by a mixed (binary) SAM44–46 comprising PAC3Imi+ and PAC16 or PAC10Ph
translating into tailorable adsorption behavior between the extrema. These nanoparticulate
water cleaning agents do not only remove the investigated PCBs just as well from river water
(Regnitz in Erlangen, Germany), but can be recycled without any sign of degradation and only
small performance losses for three out of four pollutants.

Results and discussion
SPION characterization
In this study, SPIONs (primary diameter of about 10.7 nm providing large specific surface area
of 115.1 m2 g-1) were decorated with three different phosphonic acid derivates. PAC3Imi+,
PAC16 and PAC10Ph bind to the nanoparticle surface covalently forming SAMs in the process
as shown in Figure S1 and Figure S2 (see supplementary information) via attenuated total
reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and thermogravimetric
analysis. PAC3Imi+ renders the SPION surface more positively charged in comparison to
uncoated particles as indicated by an increase in ζ-potential at pH 7, while the other two
molecules reduce it (see Figure S3, supplementary information). However, these positive
charges repel each other leading to a lower grafting density on the surface of 1.21 ± 0.08 nm-2
compared

to

the

PAC16 (2.25 ± 0.06 nm-2)

hydrophobic-rendering

and

PAC10Ph

(2.17 ± 0.11 nm-2). This less dense packing is exploited by a second self-assembly step with
the alkyl molecules in order to form binary SAMs on the nanoparticle surface. These systems,
PAC3Imi+/PAC16@SPIONs and PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs, combine the orthogonal
properties of the individually modified SPIONs (increasing vs. decreasing ζ-potential, less vs.
more dense) on one surface (see Figures S1-S3, supplementary information).
Magnetic biphenyl and PCB extraction
All magnetic extractions were performed at neutral pH with a fixed pollutant-SPIONs ratio
(7 mL à 1 µM of PCB, i.e., 7 nmol were treated with 5.0 ± 0.1 mg of SPIONs). This ratio was
deliberately chosen to enable quantitative comparison between the systems. Such low
concentrations require robust analytical quantification. Based on recommendations by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency on quantification of PCBs,47 this was achieved
by washing the adsorbent systems after magnetic water cleaning with hexane to resolubilize all
non-covalently collected pollutants followed by analysis via GC-MS. To each sample an

internal standard (decachloro-1,1’-biphenyl, PCB 209) at a fixed concentration was added.
Representative chromatograms and calibration series of varying analyte to standard
concentrations are given in Figure S4 (see supplementary information).
The two hydrophobically-rendered systems, PAC16@SPIONs and PAC10Ph@SPIONs, the
positively charged PAC3Imi+@SPIONs as well as their orthogonal binary SAM adsorbent
systems (all in reference to uncoated SPIONs) were applied to aqueous biphenyl and PCB
solutions. The magnetically extracted biphenyl and PCB amounts at the fixed pollutant-SPION
ratio are summarized in Figure 2. Firstly, the molecular SAMs enable efficient magnetic
collection overall. The uncoated SPIONs (reference) peak at 0.80 ± 0.47 nmol removal for
PCB 77 while only extracting 0.20 ± 0.11 nmol for biphenyl. On the other hand,
PAC16@SPIONs is able to remove 3.00 ± 0.42 nmol of biphenyl up to 5.10 ± 0.17 nmol for
PCB 14 with a strong drop in performance for PCB 77. While PAC10Ph@SPIONs behaves
similarly, PAC3Imi+@SPIONs shows as low removal as uncoated SPIONs for biphenyl,
however, the highest magnetic extraction performance at all for PCB 77 of 4.86 ± 0.91 nmol.
PAC3Imi+/PAC16@SPIONs has the same trend as PAC16@SPIONs while extracting biphenyl,
PCB 2 and PCB 14 less and PCB 77 better. Furthermore, PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs
follows this trend even more pronounced.
These results indicate an interplay of hydrophobic effect driven segregation (i.e., hydrophobic
segregation) and electrostatic interaction as the two major non-covalent interaction motifs
between the investigated pollutants and the functionalized adsorbent surface.48 PCBs are less
water soluble with increasing chlorination degree.43 For biphenyl, PCB 2 and PCB 14 a
respective increase in removal amounts is seen for all adsorbent systems corresponding to their
decreasing water solubility. This in combination with the performance of PAC16@SPIONs and
PAC10Ph@SPIONs supports a strong hydrophobic segregation on the nanoparticle surface for
these pollutants. These adsorbents, however, lose a lot of performance for PCB 77 despite it
being least water-soluble. Here, PAC3Imi+@SPIONs works best. This may be due to the
positive charges on the surface that can attract electron-rich chlorine atoms, of which PCB 77
comprises the most among the investigated molecules.

coating of the SPIONs. Aqueous solutions of 7 mL initially contained 7 nmol (1 µM) of pollutant at
neutral pH and were treated with 5.0 ± 0.1 mg of SPIONs. Hydrophobic PAC16@SPIONs and
PAC10Ph@SPIONs remove biphenyl, PCB 2 and PCB 14 more efficiently with a trending increase for
less water solubility, while PAC3Imi+@SPIONs drastically outperforms them for PCB 77 despite it
being least water-soluble. Binary SAMs on SPIONs show performances in between the extrema. Data
are represented as mean ± standard deviation.

For the binary SAM coated SPIONs, the characterized combination of orthogonal properties
of charged PAC3Imi+@SPIONs and hydrophobic PAC16@SPIONs or PAC10Ph@SPIONs
translates into their interaction with the pollutant molecules. The extraction is dominated by
the properties of the alkyl part of the SAM, however, complemented with the influence of
PAC3Imi+ (compare ζ-potentials in Figure S3, supplementary information) enabling average
removal amounts in between the unitary SAMs. As mentioned before, PAC10Ph was used not
only to serve hydrophobic interaction sites, but also to provide electron-rich phenyl rings for
potential interaction with electron-deficient, chlorinated phenyl rings of the PCBs. While the
magnetic extraction performance of PAC16@SPIONs and PAC10Ph@SPIONs differs only
insignificantly, PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs shows on average a worse performance for
biphenyl and PCB 2, a comparable one for PCB 14 and an increase for PCB 77 (with large
variation in between multiplicates) in reference to the other binary coated system. This points
to a potential second, weaker instance of electrostatic interaction: repulsion between electronrich rings of biphenyl and PCB 2 and the electron-rich phenyl ring in PAC10Ph as well as
attraction of electron-deficient rings in PCB 77 towards these.
Magnetic extraction of biphenyl and PCB mixtures
In the environment PCBs usually occur in mixtures.5 Therefore, also mixtures of the
investigated biphenyl and PCBs were magnetically treated with SPION systems (now
containing 1 µM of each pollutant, i.e., 28 nmol overall) as presented in Figure 3. In addition
to the removed amounts (top), the normed shares of each pollutant in the removed amount are
given (bottom) enabling better pollutant interaction preference discussion between the systems.
Overall, the combined magnetically removed amounts are increased for treatment of mixtures.
PAC3Imi+@SPIONs extracts a sum of 7.98 ± 1.13 nmol of pollutants with the highest share of
42.9 ± 6.4 % coming from PCB 77, 34.5 ± 7.8 % from PCB 14, 12.5 ± 6.3 % from biphenyl
and 10.0 ± 2.0 % from PCB 2. Again, PAC16@SPIONs and PAC10Ph@SPIONs behave
similarly by extracting 16.55 ± 1.71 and 15.69 ± 1.45 nmol respectively with highest share
stemming from PCB 14 (about 33 % in both cases) and no significant deviation between the
shares of biphenyl, PCB 2 and PCB 77 (about 21-23 % each). In general, multiplicates show
relatively large variations for PCB 14. With the binary coated PAC3Imi+/PAC16@SPIONs and
PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs overall 14.62 ± 1.65 and 13.34 ± 1.55 nmol of pollutants are
removed. Here, PCB 14 also makes the biggest share of about 37 % in both cases, while the
share of PCB 77 is estimated to 26.5 ± 3.2 and 28.5 ± 5.0 % respectively. The shares of
9

biphenyl removed by PAC3Imi+/PAC16@SPIONs and PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs are
17.0 ± 4.4 and 15.0 ± 2.9 % and, therefore, being lower than about 20% for PCB 2.

Figure 3: Magnetically removed amounts of biphenyl and PCBs from mixtures depending on the
molecular coating of the SPIONs. Aqueous solutions of 7 mL initially contained 7 nmol (1 µM) of
each pollutant, i.e., 28 nmol in sum, at neutral pH and were treated with 5.0 ± 0.1 mg of SPIONs. The
top graph shows magnetically removed amounts and the bottom graph the respective normed shares of
biphenyl and each PCB. Overall, PCB 14 is removed best by the hydrophobic adsorbents. The
preference of PAC3Imi+@SPIONs for PCB 77 can be integrated in the behavior of the hydrophobic
systems as results with PAC3Imi+/PAC16@SPIONs and PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs show. Data are
represented as mean ± (Gaussian error propagated) standard deviation.

At the previously introduced maximum contaminant level of 0.5 µg L-1 set by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency every liter contains about 2.3 nmol of PCBs calculated with
the average molar mass of the here investigated pollutants. The SPIONs could be able to adsorb
this amount in a single treatment. The performances of the different adsorbent systems for
treatment of mixtures of biphenyl and PCBs mostly resemble the trends of the separate
extractions. The overall higher removal amounts need to be considered under the influence of
in sum higher starting amounts. Hydrophobic segregation leads to PAC16@SPIONs and
PAC10Ph@SPIONs extracting the highest amounts of pollutants with biggest share of PCB 14.

PCB 77 is not significantly worse extracted than biphenyl and PCB 2 by these systems in
contrast to the separate treatments indicating potential interaction among the pollutants.
Adsorbed electron-rich phenyl rings, e.g., of biphenyl, may interact with the deficient rings of
PCB 77 leading to better magnetic extraction. PAC3Imi+@SPIONs extracted the smallest sum
of contaminant molecules overall, but show a higher preference for PCB 77 despite it being
the least water-soluble as mentioned before, which should lead to highest preference for
adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces instead. This confirms the previously identified
electrostatic interaction as second major interaction force at play. The electronegative chlorine
atoms

are

attracted

by

the

imidazolium

cations. The

binary

coated

systems,

PAC3Imi+/PAC16@SPIONs and PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs, again integrate both results in
one system. The overall higher extraction amounts with peak in PCB 14 observed for the
hydrophobic adsorbents are maintained while incorporating the higher affinity for PCB 77 in
comparison to biphenyl and PCB 2 coming from the electrostatic interaction sites provided by
PAC3Imi+. Here, the electron-rich phenyl ring in PAC10Ph provides no further significant
interaction motif. The preference for removing PCB 77 is of particular interest as it is coplanar,
substituted in both para and two meta positions while being non-ortho-substituted representing
the most toxic PCBs.49
Approaching more realistic cleaning conditions and constraints
In realistic applications mixtures of biphenyl and PCBs would not be present in a matrix of
deionized (DI) water, but in much more complex, natural water matrices. As investigated
before on other examples38,50, the performance of the presented adsorbent systems, represented
by PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs, was tested on biphenyl and PCB mixtures in actual river
water collected from the Regnitz in Erlangen, Germany (49°35'14.2" N 10°58'51.9" E) as
illustrated in Figure 4 a) and b). Removing about 15-16 nmol of pollutants both from DI and
river water matrices with an adsorption share of about 37-38 % for PCB 14 and about 34 % for
the most toxic PCB 77, the PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs work just as well in this more
realistic scenario. The differences in comparison to Figure 3 are likely due to strong influences
of minor concentration fluctuations in the starting solutions. The data in Figure 3 was averaged
across twice as many multiplicates. So far, all extractions were performed with the same
employed mass of SPIONs to identify the role of the different functional coatings. In Figure 4
c) the employed mass is varied for constant starting amounts of 7 nmol each of biphenyl and
PCBs in mixtures. Next to the removed amounts, this time also the efficiencies are given. While
with the previously tested mass of 5.0 ± 0.1 mg of PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs about
11

16 nmol of PCBs are removed, decreasing the mass by a factor of five to 1.00 ± 0.02 mg still
removes about 13 nmol overall. By increasing the mass to 15.0 ± 0.1 mg about 20 nmol are
removed. Overall, the removal efficiencies of biphenyl, PCB 2 and PCB 14 can be increased
by employing more SPIONs with a peak for PCB 14 of 97.6 ± 0.9 % removal using
15.0 ± 0.1 mg of PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs. In contrast, the efficiency for PCB 77 remains
constant for all employed masses around 80 %. It should be mentioned that the removal
efficiency is found being non-linearly dependent on the employed mass, which makes
extrapolation hardly possible. The values should be regarded as proof-of-concept only.

Figure 4: Magnetically removed amounts of biphenyl and PCBs from mixtures in DI vs. river
water as well as efficiency dependence on the employed mass on the example of
PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs. a) Photograph of river water sampling site, in which the decorated
SPIONs work as well as in DI water as seen in b). Aqueous solutions of 7 mL initially contained 7 nmol
(1 µM) of each pollutant, i.e., 28 nmol in sum. In DI water the pH was neutral, while the natural value
of 7.95 was maintained in river water. The employed mass of PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs in b) was
5.0 ± 0.1 mg. c) Variation of the employed mass of these SPIONs for treatment of DI water spiked with
equally concentrated PCB mixtures as in b) shows that more SPIONs yield higher removal efficiencies
of up to 97.6 ±0.9 % as demonstrated for PCB 14. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation.

Another aspect to be considered is recyclability of the adsorbent. Again, with the same
surrogate SPION system repeated water treatments of biphenyl and PCB mixtures were
conducted. As ATR-FTIR spectra and thermogravimetric analyses show, no degradation of the
binary SAM on the SPIONs can be observed after three cycles, nor do any pollutants remain
on the particle surface after hexane washing (see Figure S5, supplementary information). In
terms of removal performance, the removed amount of 15.34 ± 0.82 nmol in the first cycle
drops by about 38% for the second and another 12 % for third cycle mostly by decrease in the
removed amount of PCB 77 (see Figure S6, supplementary information). This could be due to
remaining traces of hexane in the shell from the washing process that compete with adsorption
of PCB 77. Nevertheless, the surrogate SPIONs are found to be recyclable.

Conclusion
In this study we presented nanoparticulate water cleaning agents based on ton-scale produced
SPIONs covered with SAMs composed of commercially available phosphonic acid derivates.
These simple and non-toxic37,38 adsorbents enable magnetic extraction of POP-representative
biphenyl, mono-chlorinated PCB 2, di-chlorinated PCB 14 and tetra-chlorinated PCB 77 from
aqueous solutions at low concentrations. An interplay of hydrophobic segregation and
electrostatic interactions cause the non-covalent attraction of the pollutants to the
functionalized nanoparticle surface. The nature of this surface is tailorable by choice of the
phosphonic acid derivate SAM. PAC3Imi+@SPIONs provides positively charged interaction
sites, while PAC16@SPIONs and PAC10Ph@SPIONs equip the adsorbent surface with a
hydrophobic interface, which translates into corresponding interactions with the pollutants.
Since the water solubility of PCBs decreases with increasing degree of chlorination,43 an
increasing segregation from biphenyl to PCB 14 onto PAC16@SPIONs and PAC10Ph@SPIONs
is observed. Counterintuitively, this inverts for the least water-soluble PCB 77, which is
removed best by PAC3Imi+@SPIONs. This is attributed to electrostatic interactions between
the cationic imidazolium and electronegative chlorine atoms. The orthogonal properties of
these SAMs can be integrated into single adsorbent systems with binary SAMs comprising
PAC3Imi+ and PAC16 or PAC10Ph on one surface. These systems show magnetic extraction
performances in between the extrema, while being dominated by the influence of the uncharged
molecules. Since PCBs usually occur in mixtures, the pollutants were also removed in
competition. Here, the described trends continue with PAC3Imi+@SPIONs showing highest
affinity to PCB 77, while the hydrophobic adsorbents extract PCB 14 best. A convolution of

With

PAC3Imi+/PAC10Ph@SPIONs as surrogate, it was shown that magnetic extraction of PCB
mixtures works just as well in a natural water matrix, i.e., river water collected from the Regnitz
in Erlangen, Germany. By employing more SPIONs higher removal efficiencies can be
achieved approaching up to 97.6 ± 0.9 % removal in a single treatment as demonstrated for
PCB 14. Furthermore, recyclability of these adsorbents was shown. The binary SAM does not
degrade over three cycles of application. Ultimately, we believe that the demonstrated approach
of magnetic water cleaning of PCBs is very promising as efficiently removing POPs at low
concentrations from water remains a challenge. Being able to address individual components
of pollutant molecule mixtures preferentially by tailoring the molecular shell on large surface
area providing nanoadsorbents may be beneficial in the future considering the majority of
pollutants is still out there.19

Experimental procedures
Materials
Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were provided by Comar Chemicals
(Pty). These particles show the crystal structure of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) as determined
previously38 and have an average primary diameter of 10.7 nm assuming maghemite bulk
density and spherical shape calculated from their Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific
surface area (SSASPIONs) of 115.1 m2 g-1 measured via N2 gas adsorption with a Nova 4000e
from Quantachrome. More details can be found in the supplementary information. Phosphonic
acid derivates 1-methyl-3-(propylphosphonic acid) imidazolium bromide (simplified as the
cation only PAC3Imi+; ≥ 95 %) and 10-phenyldecylphosphonic acid (PAC10Ph; ≥ 95 %) were
purchased from SiKÉMIA, while n-hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16) was obtained from PCI
Synthesis. The contaminants 1,1’-biphenyl (biphenyl; 99.5 %), 3-chloro-1,1’-biphenyl
(polychlorinated biphenyl 2 (PCB 2); analytical standard), 3,5-dichloro-1,1’-biphenyl (PCB
14; analytical standard) as well as the quantification internal standard decachloro-1,1’-biphenyl
(PCB 209; analytical standard) stem from Sigma-Aldrich. 3,3’,4,4’-Tetrachloro-1,1’-biphenyl
(PCB 77; 99.8 %) was purchased from LGC Standards. As solvents methanol (≥ 99 %),
acetone (≥ 99.5 %) and hexane (≥ 99 %) from Carl Roth as well as deionized (DI) water from
the DI tap of the Interdisciplinary Center for Nanostructured Films building were used. The

river water was taken from the Regnitz in Erlangen, Germany (49°35'14.2" N 10°58'51.9" E)
on April 3, 2024. After removing coarse sediments by decanting, it was filtered twice through
a nylon stocking (30 DEN, 33 dtex) and stored in a brown glass bottle.
SPIONs functionalization
Methanol solutions à 5 mM for PAC3Imi+ or 10 mM for PAC16 and PAC10Ph were added to
dispersions of SPIONs (3 mg mL-1) also in methanol at a volumetric ratio of 3:10 respectively.
These concentrations were determined to saturate the surface beforehand. The mixture was
sonicated for 30 min at 25 °C in a Sonocool 255 from Bandelin. Unbound phosphonic acid
molecules were removed by two washing cycles consisting of sedimenting the functionalized
SPIONs with a Multifuge X1R from Heraeus (13,000 rpm at 5 °C) followed by redispersion in
fresh methanol. Finally, the coated SPIONs were sedimented again and dried at 60 °C overnight. For binary shells, the PAC3Imi+ functionalized SPIONs (PAC3Imi+@SPIONs) were not
dried in the last step but redispersed in the initial methanol volume and then mixed with
solutions of PAC16 or PAC10Ph à 10 mM in the same ratio as for the first iteration. Sonication
as well as both washing cycles were repeated and the particles finally dried at 60 °C over-night.
SPIONs characterization
The functionalization of the SPIONs was qualitatively confirmed by attenuated total
reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) recorded with an IR
Prestige 21 from Shimadzu between 650 and 4000 cm-1 at a resolution of 4 cm-1. The data was
corrected with the internal atmospheric correction (Shimadzu IRsolution 1.60) removing
residual H2O and CO2 vibration bands and normed to the interval borders 650 and 4000 cm-1.
Quantitatively, the particles were thermogravimetrically analyzed with a TG 209 F1 Libra from
Netzsch. The temperature was continuously increased to 1000 °C at 30 °C min-1 while being
exposed to a gas flow of 10 mL min-1 of O2 and 40 mL min-1 of N2. The measured curves were
smoothed with the software Netzsch Proteus Thermal Analysis 8.0.3. The grafting densities of
the phosphonic acids (GDPA) on the SPIONs’ surface were estimated via Equation 1. wt is the
relative mass loss between 150 and 700 °C in percent, NA is Avogadro’s constant, MWPA is the
molar mass of the respective phosphonic acid derivate (or of PAC16/PAC10Ph respectively for
the binary coated SPIONs as they make up the majority of the coating as determined by ATRFTIR) corrected by the staying anchor group51 and SSASPIONs the specific surface area of the
SPIONs.

Hydrodynamic diameters (given as Z-average) and ζ-potentials of particles in dispersion were
determined via dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering respectively with a Zetasizer Nano
ZS running software version 7.13 from Malvern. Here, the SPIONs were not dried after
functionalization, but redispersed in DI water. A reservoir of DI water was titrated to the desired
pH with aqueous 0.25 M NaOH and HCl solutions and spiked with the SPION dispersion. The
obtained pH value was noted afterwards. Measurements were conducted in DTS1070 cells.
The ζ-potential at pH 7 was obtained via fitting the data points with a Boltzmann function
(sigmoidal curve) in Origin 2024b with standard settings.
Magnetic biphenyl and PCB extraction
Biphenyl and PCBs were dissolved in acetone at concentrations of 100 µM followed by
dilution with DI water to obtain 1 µM solutions in DI water with 1 vol% of acetone (this
ensures solubility especially for the low-soluble PCB 77).52,53 These were titrated to pH 7 with
aqueous 0.25 M NaOH and HCl solutions. Respectively, 7 mL of contaminant solution were
given to 5.0 ± 0.1 mg (except when the mass was varied) of SPIONs, which were predispersed
in 50 µL of acetone. These dispersions were put in a vortex mixer for 10 min at 500 rpm
followed by 30 min of magnetic separation of the SPIONs carrying the contaminants. For the
competitive extraction of biphenyl and the PCBs equal volumes each of 400 µM solutions in
acetone were mixed. The resulting solution containing each contaminant at 100 µM was diluted
accordingly with DI water to obtain an aqueous solution with 1 vol% of acetone containing
each molecule at 1 µM. This solution was titrated to pH 7 and treated with SPIONs as described
before. For the magnetic extraction from river water, the contaminants containing acetone
solution was diluted with river water instead. Here, no titration was conducted to maintain the
natural pH, which was measured at 7.95. For recycling the SPIONs were magnetically
separated from the hexane solution that was later quantified, washed with fresh hexane and
dried in the oven at 80 °C. These particles were then wetted with 50 µL of acetone again and
iteratively applied to contaminant-spiked DI water. All magnetic extractions of individual
biphenyl and PCBs as well as the competitive study containing all four contaminants were
conducted in hexaplicates. Comparison of DI to river water as well as the study of varying
starting mass of SPIONs were done in triplicates, while recycling was done in quintuplicates
but one multiplicate was lost in the last step for characterization purposes.

Quantification of magnetically extracted biphenyl and PCBs
After magnetically collecting the SPIONs from water, they were transferred to 10 mL of hexane
and sonicated for 10 min at 25 °C in a Sonocool 255 from Bandelin to wash off any biphenyl
or PCB. Aliquots of 1.5 mL were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 20 °C for 10 min in a Mikro
200R from Hettich to remove any SPIONs. 1.125 mL of the contaminant (i.e., analyte) hexane
solution where mixed with 0.375 mL of PCB 209 (referred to as internal standard) à 4 µM in
hexane to result in an analyte solution containing 1 µM of internal standard. This solution was
investigated by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Based on method
recommendations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency on quantification of
PCBs,47 2 µL were splitlessly injected at 270 °C via a AOC 20i autosampler into a GC-MSQP2010 SE all from Shimadzu. Via helium as carrier gas at a total flow rate of 10 mL min-1
the analytes were separated by a Zebron ZB-5Plus column from Phenomenex (30 m length,
0.25 mm diameter and 0.25 µm coating thickness). The column oven was heated from 80 °C
(held for 1 min) to 300 °C (held for 5 min) at a rate of 22 °C min-1. Finally, m/z ratios between
30 and 600 were recorded with a detector voltage of 0.99 ± 0.3 kV. The unknown analyte
concentrations were determined by referring the respective peak areas in the specifically ionfiltered chromatograms (quantifier m/z ratios: 154 Da (biphenyl), 188 Da (PCB 2), 222 Da
(PCB 14) and 292 Da (PCB 77)) to the peak area of the internal standard PCB 209 (quantifier
m/z ratios: 497 or 498 Da). Previously, internal calibration series of varying analyte (1.5, 1,
0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 µM) and constant internal standard (1 µM) concentrations were
established in triplicates (see Figure S4, supplementary information). All analyses including
linear regression were performed via GCMSsolution 4.44 from Shimadzu.
