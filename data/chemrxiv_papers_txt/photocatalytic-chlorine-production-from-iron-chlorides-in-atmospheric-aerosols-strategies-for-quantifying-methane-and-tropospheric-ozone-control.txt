Abstract
It was recently discovered that chlorine is produced photocatalytically from mineral dustsea spray aerosols, impacting methane and tropospheric ozone, and an evaluation was
made of the climate and environmental impact of a chlorine-based intervention to draw
(3−n)
down methane. The generation of chlorine by the iron chlorides Fe(III)Cln
will also
occur due to iron present in shipping plumes. To study efficiency and environmental implications, there is a need for additional information about the behavior of the process
under a range of atmospheric conditions. Here we use box modeling to evaluate whether
it is possible to experimentally observe this mechanism in a ship’s plume, or in a plume
of pure iron dust, emitted for example from a tower. Detection limits for Cl, Cl2 , HOCl,
ClO, ClNO3 , ClNO2 , CO, C2 H6 , δ 13 C(CO) and CH2 O are determined based on values
from the literature. We find that the most promising and low-cost experimental indicators of Cl0 production are the concentration of photoactive iron and the CO:ethane ratio, and Cl2 is a useful indicator if cost is not a limitation. For ships with high NOx emissions, ClNO2 and ClNO3 could also potentially be used, and for towers emitting Fe without NOx the concentration of HOCl and ClO could be used. δ 13 C(CO) is a very direct
method to detect methane removal, but only gives a clear signal for high iron emissions.

Researchers have discussed a potential solution to tackle rising atmospheric methane
levels, a major contributor to global warming. Iron-salt aerosols, produced naturally in
the atmosphere today from mineral dust and sea spray, could potentially be used as a
cost-effective intervention to remove methane. However, there are significant questions
about the safety, efficacy and appropriate conditions for any such approach.Our study
evaluates methods of characterising the impact of such an intervention by evaluating chlorine production in various atmospheric conditions, specifically in ship plumes or when
emitted from towers.

51

We assess methods that could be used in field studies, including measuring photoactive iron concentration, the CO:ethane ratio, and advanced species detection methods. Field studies are crucial to determine the viability of iron-salt aerosols in combating global warming, balancing potential benefits with safety considerations. This research
provides a vital step towards understanding and implementing innovative solutions to
mitigate climate change.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, currently responsible for more than 1/3 of global
warming since pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2021), and it is atmospheric burden continues to increase with a new record set in 2022 (Lan et al., 2024). The pathways assessed
by the IPCC that stay below 1.5 °C of global warming by 2050 require substantial reductions of methane emissions (IPCC, 2021; Rogelj & Lamboll, 2024). The main way
to achieve this is to reduce methane emissions from especially agriculture, fossil fuels and
waste. According to Höglund-Isaksson et al. (2020), the maximum potential for reduction in emissions is limited to 30-45 % by 2030 and 50 % by 2050. This leaves a large amount
of methane that cannot be mitigated unless new currently unknown mitigation technologies are discovered, or if a technology is developed to remove methane from the atmosphere, similar to carbon dioxide removal technologies.
While the Global Methane Pledge signed by many countries may contribute to reducing emissions (European Commission, 2023 November 2021, Brussels), it is not sufficient to prevent 1.5 °C of global warming by 2050 (Rogelj & Lamboll, 2024). In addition, due to global temperature rise the biological emissions of methane are increasing
substantially (Kleinen et al., 2021; Nisbet et al., 2023), which can not be addressed through

anthropogenic methane emission reductions. According to recent work, atmospheric methane
removal has the potential to reduce global average temperature by 0.4-1 °C (Smith &
Mathison, 2024; Abernethy et al., 2021; Staniaszek et al., 2021), helping to avoid substantial levels of additional warming by mid-century (Smith & Mathison, 2024), and may
reduce climate risks (Abernethy & Jackson, 2024).
To achieve these benefits, thousands of megatons of atmospheric methane removal
will be required urgently (Smith & Mathison, 2024). Such scale and time to scale can
likely only be achieved through open-system approaches (Abernethy & Jackson, 2024;
Pennacchio, Mikkelsen, et al., 2024), such as atmospheric oxidation enhancement by lofting Iron Salt Aerosols (ISA) (Oeste et al., 2017; Meyer-Oeste, 2014; Ming et al., 2021))
into the atmosphere to catalytically generate chlorine radicals that oxidize methane. However, because such open-systems are tougher to verify and have higher risks of unintended
consequences, quantification and observations to verify any hypothetical future methane
removal is important to enable governance approaches.
Research into Iron Salt Aerosols (ISA) (Oeste et al., 2017; Meyer-Oeste, 2014; Ming
et al., 2021) is still in an early phase, with only few demonstrations in the laboratory (Wittmer,
Bleicher, & Zetzsch, 2015; Wittmer, Bleicher, Ofner, & Zetzsch, 2015; Wittmer & Zetzsch, 2017; Mikkelsen et al., 2024). There are significant questions regarding the safety,
efficacy and appropriate conditions for any such approach (Gorham et al., 2024). According to global modeling, low-intensity chlorine emissions by ISA can under certain
conditions cause methane to increase due to destruction of ozone that leads to decreased
OH (van Herpen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Meidan et al., 2024; Pennacchio, van Herpen, et al., 2024). Other potential adverse impacts that need to be studied are iron aerosols
causing warming by absorbing radiation (Meidan et al., 2024) and stratospheric ozone
destruction (Li et al., 2023) However, recently iron salt aerosols have been reported in
Sahara dust mixed with sea spray (van Herpen et al., 2023), creating opportunities for
studying some of these questions.
The main source of anthropogenic iron in the atmosphere is shipping, due to metal
impurities found in fuel (Agrawal et al., 2008), estimated at below 2 Gg Fe/yr (Ito, 2013).
It is hypothesized that these anthropogenic emissions of soluble iron will mix with seasalt aerosols over the ocean, creating iron-salt aerosols that would produce chlorine, removing methane from the atmosphere (Oeste et al., 2017; Ming et al., 2021). Emissions
from shipping change depending on maritime policy (Čampara et al., 2018) and the choice
and composition of fuel. Therefore, more research must be conducted regarding the formation of ISA in shipping plumes. A switch to novel shipping fuels such as methanol or
ammonia (Tomos et al., 2024) (which don’t contain iron) could reduce iron emissions leading to lower chlorine production, but there is also a potential for increasing methane removal by enhancing iron emissions by ships.
There is an increasing interest in conducting a field study into Cl production from
iron emissions. Proposed dispersion methods include the addition of FeCl3 into the hot
exhaust of ships (leveraging the buoyancy to lift up the particles), or releasing the FeCl3
from uplift towers (Oeste et al., 2017). Sturtz et al. (2022) employed a modeling approach
for the potential environmental impacts associated with a hypothetical small-scale field
test consisting of seeding cargo-ship exhaust plumes with iron salt aerosols. No significant impacts were identified in this assessment, but the authors did not assess whether
the amount of iron released would lead to a detectable amount of chlorine production.
One category of ship plume field studies uses instruments at a fixed location near
busy shipping channels, using the automatic identification system (AIS) to identify ships
and measure the plume emissions as they pass the instrument (Ault et al., 2010; Kivekäs
et al., 2014; Ausmeel et al., 2020). Another type of study creates a concentration map
by taking several measurements inside a plume (G. Chen et al., 2005). The advantage
of in-plume measurement is that accurate information is acquired about in situ chem-

istry, free of surface interference, while measurements from a fixed location are easier to
implement. For in-plume measurements, a research aircraft (Andrés Hernández et al.,
2022; G. Chen et al., 2005) or drone (Zhou et al., 2023) can fly through the ship plume
while taking measurements using a variety of instruments on board. Another way to create a concentration map of a ship plume is using Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) to scan the ship plume (Cheng et al., 2019).

In this study, we combine a time-dependent photochemical box model with plume
dispersion to evaluate whether it is possible to experimentally observe chlorine production from iron-salt aerosols in a ship plume. We perform the same evaluation for a plume
of iron salt aerosols from a source that does not emit NOx .

2.1 Box model
We employed a similar approach as used by Song et al. (2003), who studied NOx /HOx
chemistry within a ship plume by combining a plume dispersion algorithm with a timedependent photochemical box model. The box model is initialized using background marine conditions, after which we allow it to run for 16 days to reach quasi-steady state conditions for the time varying species. Subsequently, we add a pulse of NO, CO, ethane
and ISA particles on day 17 (representing emissions from the ship), which then disperse
into the background.The timing of the pulse of ship emissions in our model is done at
sun-rise. We selected this time to ensure that sunlight is available for a long as possible during the day, allowing Cl2 to still be produced far away from the ship. At the same
time this will lead to a low-estimate for Cl2 production close to the ship, which would
be higher for a mid-day emission.
The ISA particles generate Cl2 with the same efficiency as was found for mineral
dust by van Herpen et al. (2023), producing 11 photochemistry cycles per hour (5.5 Cl2
per hour) at maximum sunlight, which is on the low end of the efficiency measured in
smog chamber studies by Wittmer and Zetzsch (2017) of 6 to 78 per hour. For example, a photo-active iron concentration of 10 ng/m3 corresponds to 1.8 × 10−13 mol Fe/cm3 ,
which is multiplied by 5.5 Cl2 per hour per Fe atom, resulting in 9.9 × 10−13 mol Cl2 /hour/cm3
= 1.7 × 108 molecules Cl2 /cm3 /s. We multiply this maximum value with a diurnal profile (a number between 0 and 1).
A full overview of reactions in our photochemistry box model, which is built in the
compiler program Kintecus (Ianni, 2017), can be found in the Appendix. The model contains all the reactions that Song et al. (2003) identified as the most important for boundary layer ship plume chemistry. This includes all the inorganic reactions of the atmosphere and the full oxidation mechanism of CH4 and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), as obtained
from the Master Chemical Mechanism, MCM v3.3.1 (Master Chemical Mechanism, MCM
v3.2 , 2023). The model does not include non-methane VOC chemistry, but we included
the basic reactions for ethane with OH and Cl to be able to track the CO:ethane ratio
in the ship plume. In addition, the model contains the ClOx reactions and key deposition rates, including the uptake and hydrolysis of ClONO2 (yielding HNO3 and HOCl),
and the reactive uptake of HOCl (yielding Cl2 ). Bromine and iodine chemistry is not included in the main model runs, because it was found to have low impact on the ship plume
chemistry relevant for our conclusions. A sensitivity analysis was done using bromine
and iodine chemistry based on (Saiz-Lopez et al., 2006; Hossaini et al., 2016; Saiz-Lopez
et al., 2014). We use the same photochemistry box model in Pennacchio, van Herpen,
et al. (2024), where further details on bromine chemistry impact, including a comparison with the Community Earth System Model (Meidan et al., 2024) be found.
Plume dispersion in our model was done using the method described by Song et
al. (2003), in which the concentration change for a species due to dilution is calculated

in which Dt is the calculated dilution factor representing a rate of dispersion per
time step at time t after emission, which we calculated based on pre-defined scenarios
with known plume dispersion either from modeling or from measurements. Ci,b is the
background concentration of species i, for which we used the quasi-steady state concentration during the last 24 hours of the stabilization time. Ci,t is the concentration of species
i at time t (in s). To assess if it is possible to detect Cl2 production from iron-salt aerosols
in an emission plume, we used our box model to estimate the concentration of Cl2 , ClO,
HOCl, ClNO3 , ClNO2 , CH2 O, CO isotope changes and CO:ethane ratio changes along
the centerline of the ship’s plume. The relative wind speed (see table 2 in section 2.2)
is used to convert the time after emission into distance.
To simplify the analysis, we assume that the iron is added post-combustion into
the ship plume exhaust stream as FeCl3 , which implies that 100% of the iron is photoactive, and can produce Cl immediately after emission. Ship iron emissions resulting from
iron in the fuel have an uncertain photoactive fraction (Meidan et al., 2024) and may
require atmospheric processing before becoming photoactive, and this is excluded in our
model.
We used a NO emission of 20 g/kg fuel(G. Chen et al., 2005), a relatively high CO
emission of 12 g/kg fuel(Winnes & Fridell, 2009) (to simulate a worst case interference
from the ships CO emissions), and a CO:ethane ratio in the emission of 200 (Read et al.,
2009). The background CO level was set to 90 ppb, with a CO:ethane ratio of 50 (Read
et al., 2009). To calculate δ 13 C(CO), we assumed a background value of -30 ‰ , a value
emitted by the ship of -25 ‰ (Bergamaschi et al., 2000), and a value for CO produced
from Cl oxidation of methane of -110 ‰ (Röckmann et al., 2024).
2.2 Scenarios
Our scenarios combine a dispersion scenario (expressed with capital letters A-H)
with an iron emission scenario (expressed with lower case letters a-c).
Our lowest iron emission scenario ”a” (see Table 1) adds 0.021 g iron per second
to the exhaust, which is similar to a ship burning 3.75 ton/hour of fuel with a typical
20 ppm Fe content. Since 300 ppm ferrocene is the highest fuel concentration that still
improves engine emission conditions (“Improving performance and emissions characteristics of compression ignition engine: Effect of ferrocene nanoparticles to diesel-biodiesel
blend”, 2020), we increase iron emissions by 10× in scenario ”b” without changing any
of the other emissions. Our highest Fe emission scenario ”c” increases iron emissions again
by 10×, and is therefore higher than what could be expected from ship combustion Fe
emissions. However, note that in our model FeCl3 is added to the ship plume exhaust,
and we do not account for iron-oxide emitted by the ship itself, assuming only a low fraction is photo-active. Thus, while we based the iron emission scenarios on typical combustion emissions, in our model the iron is emitted as 100% photoactive FeCl3 that is
emitted into the exhaust stream, with the emission expressed as the amount of elemental iron within the emitted FeCl3 .

We explored the feasibility of a field study using several dispersion scenarios ranging from A to H (see Table 2.2), and we include different meterological stability classses
(Hanna et al., 1981). Dispersion in scenario A and D is based on Song et al. (2003) and
G. Chen et al. (2005), respectively, while in scenarios B, C, F and G the dispersion of
the ship plumes were calculated using the HYSPLIT atmospheric transport and dispersion model through the NOAA READY tool (Rolph et al., 2017) . Because this tool only
calculates dispersion up to 50 km, we assumed that the plume expansion continues at
the same rate beyond this distance.
Scenario A is used to compare our model output with model results in Song et al.
(2003), from which we used scenario IIb. This scenario uses a mixing height of 700 m
relative wind speed of 5 m/s, meterological stability class E (slightly stable), and NOx
emission of 10 g/s, with a background NOx concentration of 7 ppt, and O3 of 18.5 ppb.
This stability class will result in the slowest plume dispersion of all our scenarios. We
derived the plume dispersion rates from Song et al. (2003), using their reported nighttime NOx concentration and instant NOx lifetime curves.
Scenario B is a general low relative wind-speed scenario of 2.6 m/s and a meteorological stability class C (slightly unstable).
Scenario C is the hypothetical field study near the island Bonaire that was assessed
by Sturtz et al. (2022). We used the deposition rates that Sturtz calculated for Fe and
HCl emissions to calculate the plume dilution factor, and compared the result with the
output of NOAA READY for 8 m/s and stability class D (Neutral). The dilution factor was in agreement between these two methods, but because NOAA READY provides
output beyond 6 km, we used NOAA READY as input for our box model.
Scenario D uses measurement data by G. Chen et al. (2005), in which a ship plume
was sampled using an aircraft, with wind speed of 10 m/s. We will assess whether this
field study could have detected Cl2 production from ISA in the ship’s plume. Because
the observational data by G. Chen et al. (2005) is only available starting at 40 minutes
after emission, we used a NOAA READY model for the first 40 minutes.
Scenarios E, F, G and H model iron emissions from a point source of iron dust, without the pollution emissions associated with ship emissions. This scenario represents a
field study using emissions of mineral dust, iron-oxide dust, or FeCl3 , and we will sometimes refer to this as tower emissions instead of ship emissions. Scenarios E, F, G and
H were performed using the dilution factors from scenarios A, B, C and D, respectively.
In these scenarios there is no pulse of NOx , CO or ethane released, since the dust is not
emitted through fuel burning.
Background conditions are assumed to be similar for all scenarios (remote marine
boundary layer).

Several methods are available to measure iron in aerosols. Iron-salt aerosols can
be detected as photo-active iron in aerosol samples that can be collected by drawing air
through a filter inside a ship’s plume. The concentration of photoactive iron can be detected as a photo-reducible fraction of soluble iron (Y. Chen & Siefert, 2003; X. Zhu et
al., 1993; X. R. Zhu et al., 1997). This is done by determining the concentration of Fe(II)
before and after the reducible fraction of Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II). Fe(II) can be measured colorimetrically by complexation with ferrozine (Viollier et al., 2000).
The reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) is performed by either using hydroxylamine hydrochloride reduction, or by exposing the sample to direct sunlight to photo-reduce the
Fe(III) (Y. Chen & Siefert, 2003). Examples of the detection of photo-active iron in the
atmosphere are the measurement of the diel cycle of Fe(II) at Barbados by X. R. Zhu
et al. (1997) and the detection of photo-active iron in ship-based studies across the North
Atlantic (Y. Chen & Siefert, 2003). The detection limit for photoactive iron in these studies was in the order of 1 ng/m3 .
2.3.2 Cl detection with radical clock method
The so-called radical clock approach can be used to quantify the role of chlorine
chemistry inside and outside a plume (Baker et al., 2011, 2016). Chlorine atoms react
with certain hydrocarbons more quickly than others, and this pattern is different from
how hydroxyl radicals, the main atmospheric oxidant, react. The quantification can be
realized by collecting air samples for analysis by gas chromatography. Examples of this
methodology include observations of chlorine chemistry in a volcanic plume (Baker et
al., 2011) and in the pollution outflow of Asian cities (Baker et al., 2016), based on which
we estimate a detection limit of on average 1×104 Cl cm−3 over 24 hours exposure time,
or 1×105 Cl cm−3 for 2.4 hours of exposure.

2.3.3 Cl2 and HOCl
Lawler et al. (2011) detected HOCl and Cl2 in atmospheric air at Cape Verde using chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (CIMS-MS) via the formation of a
Br – adduct. The instrument detection limits were approximately 30 ppt HOCl and 1
ppt Cl2 for the first three days of the study, and 5 ppt HOCl and 2 ppt Cl2 during the
last four days. Chemical ionization mass spectrometers have been carried on board research aircraft (Yuan et al., 2016; Le Breton et al., 2012), including an aircraft CIMS
study of ship plumes (G. Chen et al., 2005), but no CIMS measurements of in-plume halogen chemistry have been performed to date.
2.3.4 ClO
ClO can be detected with long-path DOAS (Stutz et al., 2002) which has the advantage that it generates a real-time signal, and can scan different parts of a plume. To
detect ClO with LP-DOAS, the concentration should be above 1 ppt and preferably above
5 ppt (Stutz et al., 2002). Alternatively, ClO can also be measured with CIMS, with a
similar detection limit (Custard et al., 2016) (2.6 ppt for 2.8 s integration time). We will
use 5 ppt in our analysis.
2.3.5 ClNO3
ClNO3 can be detected in the atmosphere with a detection limit of less than 3 ppt
using CIMS on board of aircraft (Marcy et al., 2005). ClNO3 can also be detected using mid-infrared spectrometry for studies of stratospheric ClNO3 via absorptions in the
wavelength range of 5.7 µm to 12.8 µm (at 779, 809, 1293 and 1735 cm−1 ) (von Clarmann & Johansson, 2018).
2.3.6 ClNO2
The detection limit for ClNO2 with CIMS is around 3 ppt for 1 minute integration,
and 13 ppt for 1 s (Kercher et al., 2009; Saiz-Lopez & von Glasow, 2012). Based on these
numbers we will use a detection limit threshold of 10 ppt, taking into account high time
resolution requirements if the CIMS is carried by aircraft into the plume.
2.3.7 CO:ethane ratio
The ratio of CO to ethane is basically equivalent to a radical clock, and could potentially be a very cost effective method using low cost sensors. That is why we model
this ratio separately.
The reaction rate coefficients for CO and ethane with OH are approximately the
same(Read et al., 2009). In addition, CO and ethane are typically emitted at a fixed ratio by sources(Read et al., 2009). Due to these conditions, the ratio between atmospheric
CO and ethane is quite stable if OH is the only relevant sink. However, ethane reacts
with Cl whereas CO does not, making the CO-ethane ratio a sensitive metric of Cl radical exposure. The method was used by Read et al. (2009) in Cape Verde, where large
seasonal fluctuations in the CO:ethane ratio were measured. These variations could potentially be due to a large seasonal source of Cl, such as the MDSA mechanism reported
by van Herpen et al. (2023).
In our simulation, we used a CO:ethane ratio in the ship exhaust of 200 (mole/mole)
(Read et al., 2009). The background CO level was set to 90 ppb, with a typical CO:ethane
ratio of 50, based on measurements near Cape Verde (Read et al., 2009).

For ethane detection, we use the reported detection limit of 10 ppt for photo-acoustic
trace gas detection (van Herpen et al., 2002), while gas chromatography with flame ionization detection has a detection limit of 3 ppt (Read et al., 2009).
2.3.8 δ 13 C(CO)
The carbon isotopic composition (δ 13 C) of CO can be used to detect an enhanced
Cl radical concentration due to the strong kinetic isotope effect occurring in the reaction of CH4 + Cl. It has been shown for a range of tropospheric temperatures that Cl
reacts about 70 ‰ faster with 12 CH4 , relative to isotopically heavier 13 CH4 (Saueressig
et al., 1995). The first stable product of this reaction, CO, shares a carbon with the original methane molecule. Therefore, an isotopic depletion in ambient CO is evident in air
masses with enhanced chlorine oxidation of methane. Unlike alternative proxy methods
outlined here, δ 13 C(CO) is directly linked to CH4 + Cl chemistry.
Measurements of δ 13 C(CO) reflect even small CO contributions from chlorine oxidation due to the low tropospheric CO background concentration. For example, if only
1 ppb of CO from chlorine oxidation (with δ 13 CCO = -110 ‰, Röckmann et al. (2024))
is added to background air (for example CO = 100 ppb and δ 13 CCO = -30.0 ‰), an isotopic shift of -0.8 ‰ is detectable:

δ 13 CCO is measured using continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)
(Pathirana et al., 2015). Analysis requires 100 mL of sample air from a glass flask pressurized to ∼ 1.5 bar. Precision of the instrument is monitored by the standard deviation of reference gas sets, which fluctuates between 0.03 – 0.10 ‰ on average. Thus, a
change of more than 0.2 ‰ in δ 13 C(CO) of ambient air is considered statistically significant. The system also accommodates a range of CO mixing ratios by adjusting sample extraction times and/or flow rates.
2.3.9 CH2 O
The extra OH from the NOx emissions of ships leads to extra CH4 oxidation within
shipping plumes, and this leads to elevated CH2 O concentrations inside the ship plume
(Song et al., 2010). In a busy shipping corridor, the increased CH2 O levels from the enhanced methane oxidation can even be observed with satellites from space, such as ESA/ERS2 GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) (Marbach et al., 2009) and TROPOMI
(De Smedt et al., 2018). Thus, CH2 O may also be an attractive indicator species for detecting additional methane oxidation by Cl in shipping plumes.
CH2 O can be detected in a ship plume by MAX-DOAS, which can be used to scan
through the plume with a detection limit of 50-300 ppt, making it a convenient detection method (Plane & Saiz-Lopez, 2006; Prados-Roman et al., 2020). While MAX-DOAS
has been demonstrated in ship plumes ((Cheng et al., 2019)), the high aerosol levels in
ship plumes will adversely affect the detection limit. Therefore the detection limit should
be expected to be worse close to the ship, when aerosol levels are still high. Alternatively,
CH2 O detectors could be used at a fixed location, with a detection of about 100 ppt(Wu
et al., 2023). We will use 100 ppt in our analysis.

Appendix Figure A1 shows that our model output for scenario A agrees with Song
et al. (2003), showing the same 3 stages of plume development (see Table 3), early plume
with O3 depletion, mid-range plume with O3 recovery and rapid OH increase and longrange plume with O3 production and maximum OH values). The concentrations in our
model output show good agreement with Song (Song et al., 2003) for NOx , O3 , OH, NO2 /NOx
ratio, HNO3 , which gives confidence that our model will be able to predict the species
of interest in our study (Cl, Cl2 , ClO, HOCl, ClNO3 , ClNO2 , HCHO, CO, ethane and
δ 13 C(CO) in CO). A difference between Song et al. (2003) and our model is that we include ClOx chemistry which leads to visible differences, especially for NO3 and N2 O5 .
This can be explained by the reaction of ClO + NO2 → ClNO3 , where the product photolyses and leads to the formation of NO3 , or hydrolyzes leading to a loss of NOx (Pennacchio,
van Herpen, et al., 2024).
The addition of ISA to the ship plume generates Cl2 that increases loss of NOx ,
which results in increased O3 and OH levels compared to the scenario without ISA particles. This accelerates the first 2 plume stages of O3 depletion and recovery, leading to
an earlier peak in O3 and OH. An Fe emission of 0.2 g/s of iron-salt aerosols leads to a
peak in [Cl] up to 1 × 106 cm−3 in scenario A.
In our scenarios for tower emissions, there is no NOx emission, due to which these
extreme fluctuations in NOx , O3 and OH will not occur, making tower scenarios very
different from ship scenarios.
Cl atoms are challenging to detect directly, and the next sections discuss indirect
methods to detect the Cl chemistry or the presence of ISA in the plume, by measuring
other species that are indicative of the Cl chemistry (see Methods).

3.1 Photoactive iron
Throughout this paper, figures will show model output along the center of the plume
(also for altitude), as a function of distance from the ship. The time since emission depends on the relative wind speed (for example 5 m/s relative wind speed means that 5000
meters corresponds to 1000 seconds after emission; note that wind speeds vary between
scenarios, see Table 2.2).
Figure 1 shows the Fe concentrations in iron-salt aerosols for all plume dispersion
scenarios (cf. Table 2.2) in combination with iron emission scenario (a) (our lowest Fe
emission scenario). It can be seen that photo-active iron concentrations up to 10 km are
a factor of 10 above the detection limit of 1 ng/m3 , and that ship and tower emissions
have identical Fe concentrations for the same dispersion profile. Thus, a field study detecting photo-active iron is feasible for all scenarios and should preferably be done within
10 km of the ISA source. If the fraction of photo-active iron in shipping fuel emissions
is greater than 10%, it would also be detectable by this method. However,this distance
corresponds to a time since emission of 20 - 60 minutes (depending on the relative wind
speed), and ISA particles generated via iron emissions by fuel combustion may not yet
have appeared within this time. In addition, the disadvantage of photo-active iron measurements is that they do not necessarily prove that the photo-active iron also generates
Cl2 . This is only possible with the detection methods presented in the next sections.
It can be seen in Figure 1 that scenarios B and C have similar dispersions as function of distance, but scenario B has lower dispersion with time, which is due to the higher
relative wind speed combined with higher stability class for scenario C compared to B.
Scenario A leads to the highest Fe concentrations in the dispersed plume (due to relatively low wind speed combined with high stability class), and scenario D will have relatively higher Fe concentrations downwind from the emission source (this scenario is based
on observational data and changing conditions led to less dispersion downstream). Scenario D has more fluctuation in the dilution factor, initially following scenario B and C,
but then the dilution slows down and it catches up with scenario A. This illustrates the
kind of variability that can be expected in the field.

3.2 Cl detection with radical clock method
Our model includes a background HCl concentration of 100 ppt(Wang et al., 2019)
that reacts with OH to form Cl, resulting in a background Cl concentration that does
not exceed 1 × 103 cm−3 , far below the detection limit of 1×105 Cl cm−3 for 2.4 hours
of exposure. Ship plume NOx emissions lead to increased OH levels, that result in increased Cl levels up to 6×103 cm−3 in scenarios without Fe emission.
Our lowest iron emission rate of 0.02 g/s already leads to Cl concentrations up to
1×105 cm−3 (see Figure 2, showing emission scenario a for all dispersion scenarios), with
almost identical concentrations for ship and tower emissions with the same dispersion
scenario. This increases to 1 × 106 cm−3 and 1 × 107 cm−3 for 10× and 100× higher iron
emissions. Thus, the radical clock method could potentially be used to detect the ISA
mechanism in a ship plume with age of 2.4 hour or more.
However, we also note that this method has only been demonstrated for large air
masses, while a plume emitted by a ship or tower is a relatively small source. Large amounts
of background air will mix into the plume, especially within the first 25 km, greatly diluting the emissions of the ship. This implies that the radical clock method may not work
during the initial strong dispersion of the plume, depending on the species that is used
for the radical clock. This point is discussed in more detail in the section 3.8. The peak
of [Cl] is expected close to the ship (see Figure 2), but beyond 25 km, [Cl] can still be
above the detection limit even for the lowest Fe emission scenario of 0.02 g/s.

3.3 Cl2
Background Cl2 levels in our model were always below 1 ppt, and the addition of
even small amounts of ISA leads to peak Cl2 concentrations of above 10 ppt that are clearly
above the detection limit of 2 ppt (see Figure 3, showing emission scenario a for all dispersion scenarios). Ship and tower emissions result in similar Cl2 concentrations for the
same dispersion scenarios.
The peak of Cl2 occurs within 5 km of the emission source.

3.4 ClO
Figure 4 shows the model output for ClO. The high NOx levels in ship plumes (scenarios A-D) strongly reduce ClO, through the reaction ClO + NO2 that forms ClNO3 .
Further away from the ship NOx levels are lower, leading to an increase in ClO, but for
low and medium iron emission scenarios this still does not generate enough ClO to exceed the detection limit of 5 ppt. Because of this, high iron emissions of 2 g/s are needed
at the source, to generate a signal that can be detected (see Figure 4, showing the highest emission scenario c for ship scenarios A-D with solid lines). We conclude that measurements of ISA based on perturbation of ClO in a ship plume are not practical unless
the NOx emissions of the ship are eliminated, or if a high amount of additional Fe is added
to the plume.
The situation is very different for the scenarios with pure iron emissions without
NOx (scenarios E-H), see Figure 4, showing the medium emission scenario b for tower
scenarios E-F with dashed lines. In these scenarios, a high ClO signal (above 10 ppt) is
found up to at least 50 km from the ship, and should be measurable with a medium Fe
emission rate (0.2 g/s). The peak ClO signal occurs close to the emission tower, between
4-10 km for most scenarios.
Scenarios A and E have a relatively high ClO signal compared to the other scenarios, because scenario A and E have more pristine background air conditions with a lower
NOx background of 7 ppb, compared to 50 ppt in the other scenarios.
To be able to compare our results with Song et al. (2003), we used relatively low
ozone background levels that are still typical for the remote marine boundary layer. A
higher ozone background could slightly increase ClO concentrations, but not to an extent that it changes the conclusions substantially.

3.5 HOCl
While HOCl is formed in a ship plume via the reaction of OH with species such
as ClNO3 , ClNO2 and Cl2 , the main source is ClO + HO2 . Due to NOx depleting O3
(see Table 3), both HOx and ClO are depleted close to the ship, which explains why HOCl
levels only increase several tens of km from the ship, more or less in tandem with the
ClO concentration profile (see Figure 5, showing the highest emission scenario c for all
dispersion scenarios). The far distance from the emission point creates challenges for its
detection, both from a logistical perspective, as well as by increasing the dependence on
meteorology. For a tower emission (without NOx , see dotted lines in Figure 5) the HOCl
concentrations increase immediately, because the ClO and HOx are not depleted close
to the emission source.
The HOCl background concentration in our model output is always below 1 ppt,
also for ships without Fe emissions. For ships, the emission of 0.021 - 0.2 g/s Fe is not
sufficient to raise the HOCl concentration above the detection limit of 30 ppt, while for
towers 0.2 g/s results in HOCl concentrations close to the detection limit. For 2 g/s Fe
emissions, our model predicts a strong HOCl concentration that can still be detected far
away from the emission source (100 km or more).

3.6 ClNO3
Figure 6 shows the model output for ClNO3 , showing a medium emission scenario
for all dispersion scenarios. ClNO3 takes a long time to form (compared to other species
investigated in this study), because it is formed from ClO + NO2 in a three-body reaction. It also has a long lifetime in the atmosphere of hours to days, depending on hydrolysis rate(Pennacchio, van Herpen, et al., 2024)). This leads to a buildup of concentration with distance. Typically, ClNO3 starts to rise 10 km from the source (in tandem
with increases in ClO), and peaks beyond 40 km.
At high distance, NOx emissions from other ships could slightly increase the ClNO3
levels, but the ClNO3 could then still be attributed to the ship emitting the FeCl3 as that
is the limiting factor.
Despite low NOx background levels, the ClNO3 concentrations in a tower emission
plume without NOx are of the same order of magnitude as in ship plumes. This can be
explained by the long distance at which ClNO3 starts to form, at which point the NOx
levels in the ship plume have already dispersed into the background.
For the lowest Fe emission scenario, the ClNO3 concentration is just below the detection limit of 3 ppt. An emission of 0.21 g/s leads to a clear ClNO3 signal that can be
detected far from the source.

3.7 ClNO2
Figure 7 shows the model output for ClNO2 , for a medium emission scenario and
with separate panels for ships and towers, because the concentrations are very different.
ClNO2 forms rapidly from the reaction of Cl + NO2 and has a relatively short lifetime,
resulting in a peak concentration close to the emission source (6 - 12 km). ClNO2 gives
a very strong signal for ship plumes due to the NOx emission by the ship, requiring an
iron emission of 0.21 g/s to exceed the detection limit of 10 ppt. However, for tower emissions the NOx levels are too low to generate a significant ClNO2 signal for any of our
emission scenarios. Thus, ClNO2 is only useful in field tests where NOx is emitted along
with the iron.
An important additional factor when using ClNO2 is that it is important to also
track variations in the background ClNO2 concentration, especially in the morning when
ClNO2 that formed during the night (from N2 O5 uptake on sea salt aerosol) will rapidly
photolyze.

3.8 CO:ethane ratio
Figure 8 shows how the CO:ethane ratio develops in a ship plume compared to the
background air, for a medium emission scenario B.b. While we start our simulation with
an CO:ethane background ratio of 200, this ratio changes during the stabilization of the
model (before iron emission) due to background Cl levels, resulting in a background CO:ethane
ratio at the start of the iron emission of around 400 for scenario B (see Figure 8). Initially the emission of CO and ethane with a ratio of 50 leads to an increase in both CO
and ethane, but the ethane levels are increased relatively more, pushing the CO:ethane
ratio down towards 50. Within the first 10 km the CO concentration in the ship plume
drops to the ambient level, while the ethane concentration continues to decrease, eventually to below background air concentrations. This becomes detectable when the CO:ethane
ratio increases to a value above the background level, giving evidence of increased Cl.
The sensitivity of this method depends on the accuracy of the ethane measurement
(10 ppt). In scenario B, at 100 km we find an ethane concentration of 210 ppt without
iron emissions, while the background concentration is 212 ppt. Thus, without iron emissions there is a slight reduction in ethane due to the increased Cl concentrations due to
the NOx emission. An iron emission of 0.2 g/s is needed to sufficiently reduce ethane for
detection, at 100 km distance leading to ethane inside the ship plume of 196 ppt (14 ppt
reduction) (see Figure 8).
For a background CO:ethane ratio of 300 to 400, using a 10 ppt accuracy for the
ethane measurement, the method is sensitive to changes of at least 10 - 20 in the CO:ethane
ratio. If the background CO:ethane ratio is lower, the method will be more sensitive. Figure 9 shows the changes in CO:ethane ratio for the various scenarios, with a medium iron
emission of 0.2 g/s.
As can be seen in Figure 9, the CO:ethane ratio is easier to interpret for tower emissions without NOx , mainly because these scenarios do not emit CO and ethane from the
emissions source. Because of this, any Cl that is generated will immediately lead to an
increase of CO:ethane above the background, allowing the method to work closer to the
emission source. However, the amount of Fe needed for a clear signal is the same for both
ship and tower emissions. Also, because tower emissions will not emit ethane, the background ethane concentration may in some cases be too low to be detectable.

3.9 δ 13 C(CO)
Figure 10 shows the modeled δ 13 C(CO) for each scenario, using a high iron emission. It is important to note that the highest Fe emission scenario c (i.e. 2.1 g/s) is the
only scenario which produces an isotopic shift large enough for statistically significant
detection by the analytical system (greater than 0.2 ‰ in δ 13 C(CO)). The CO isotopic
composition changes most strongly within 20 km of the iron source, consistent with maximum Cl concentrations in Figure 2. For ship emission scenarios (i.e. A-D), an initial
isotopic enrichment occurs due to the addition of isotopically heavy CO (δ 13 C = -25 ‰),
relative to the background (δ 13 C = -30 ‰). For this reason, isotopic depletions below
background δ 13 C(CO) due to chlorine oxidation are not detectable until 5, 10, 15 and
20 km from the emission source for scenarios A, B, C and D, respectively. For all scenarios, the total magnitude of depletions below background δ 13 C(CO) ranges from 0.4
– 2.0 ‰ within 60 km.
From these results, the primary obstacle in using δ 13 C(CO) as a detection method
for enhanced Cl oxidation in ship plumes is the slow reaction rate of the Cl + CH4 reaction. Flask samples must be obtained from air that has been sufficiently processed to
reflect the CO signature of chlorine oxidation, rather than the combusted fuel source.
The model also assumes zero interference from intersecting plumes. In a field study, intersecting plumes should be avoided or reduced when determining sample locations. If
this not possible, additional corrections are necessary for data interpretation.

3.10 CH2 O
To show the impact of iron emissions on HCHO in the plume, Figure 11 shows our
model output for CH2 O for varying iron emissions in scenario A and E. The baseline result for scenario A.0 without Fe emission is in agreement with similar scenarios that were
modeled by Song et al. (2010). There is an initial small drop in CH2 O during the initial phase of O3 and OH depletion close to the ship. This is followed by an increase in
CH2 O concentrations when O3 and OH recover above the background leading to increased
CH4 oxidation that leads to CH2 O formation. Our model does not include CH2 O emissions by the ship itself, but Song et al. (2010) showed that these emissions only have a
minor influence on the CH2 O concentrations in the ship plume. Our model also does not
include non-methane VOCs that could be a potential source for photochemical HCHO
production. This does not affect our conclusions on the useability of HCHO, because Song
et al. (2010) found that NMVOC emissions from ships were not a primary source of photochemical HCHO production inside ship plumes due to their rapid and individual dilution.
In appendix Figure A1 it can be seen that in scenario A.c (the highest iron emission for the scenario comparable to Song et al. (2010)) the maximum concentration of
Cl occurs closer to the ship than for OH. This is because the Cl production from emitted iron is not affected by the initial O3 depletion (while OH is depleted due to this).
This is why the iron emissions increase CH2 O concentrations close to the ship. With high
Fe emissions, this leads to a double peak in CH2 O concentrations; the first one from the
Fe induced Cl emission (around 10-30 km distance in this scenario) and a second peak
from the OH chemistry in the plume (around 60-80 km distance). The strength of the
CH2 O signal is above the 100 ppt detection limit for iron emissions of 0.21 g/s, but there
is no clear difference in the shape of the CH2 O curve, requiring a reference measurement
without Fe emission. A challenge is that in practice, a reference measurement without
Fe emission may not be available. In that case, the Cl emission can be detected only when
there is a clear double-peak, which requires high Fe emissions of 2.1 g/s. In addition, because the HCHO peak resulting from Cl oxidation occurs close to the ship, MAX-DOAS

detection will be complicated due to high aerosol levels in the plume, which will negatively affect the detection limit, again requiring higher Fe emissions to be detectable. Alternatively, a second species that is more closely related to the OH chemistry might be
measured, for example HNO3 formed from NO2 + OH, or H2 SO4 formed by the OH initiated oxidation of SO2 (Kim et al., 2013). For example, in our model output HNO3 peaks
at approximately the same distance from the ship as OH (see Appendix A, Figure A1),
so if CH2 O peaks earlier than HNO3 , that could indicate Cl production by Fe in the ship
plume. For HNO3 such a measurement is challenging in view of detection limits, but for
H2 SO4 this would be feasible with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) mounted
on an aircraft (G. Chen et al., 2005).
For Fe emission without NOx , the CH2 O signal from Cl oxidation of methane is
more clearly visible, because there is no OH peak from the NOx emission (so there is also
no double-peak, only one peak from Cl). This means that no reference measurement is
needed for the interpretation by a tower without NOx .
Figure 12 show the model output for the different dispersion scenarios. Without
a reference measurement, CH2 O would be an attractive indicator for Cl production, but
it needs an iron emission of 2.1 g/s in shipping plumes, and 0.21 g/s in tower emissions.
A reference measurement of for example H2 SO4 can reduce the minimum iron emission
for ship plumes to 0.21 g/s. /hlIt is important to also track background HCHO concentrations during a field study, because HCHO in background air will vary through the day
due to fluctuations in VOC oxidation, or due to fluctuations in continental sources.

3.11 Other species
While the ultimate benefit for iron-salt aerosol emissions would be methane and
ozone removal, both species were not found to be helpful indicators for the removal, because the background concentrations are too high compared to the removal amount.
In the case of methane, the additional OH chemistry in the ship plume leads to a
methane reduction in our model output of 1 ppb within the plume, while the Cl chemistry from the lowest emission scenario removes only 0.1 ppb of additional methane, and
for the highest emission scenario of 2.1 g/s the methane reduction in the plume is still
only 3 ppb at a background of 1.8 ppm. This is too low to detect in a real world field
test, where methane will naturally vary due to varying local sources.
For ozone, the impact of the additional Cl chemistry is that the first plume phase
of ozone depletion and recovery is accelerated, leading to an ozone recovery closer to the
ship. However, the shape and peak of the ozone concentration profile remains the same,
making it very hard to demonstrate the impact of the Cl chemistry, unless a direct comparison can be made with and without the iron emissions.

4 Discussion
Here we studied the release of FeCl3 into ship plumes instead of ISA particles forming via iron in shipping fuels. There are reasons to believe that the emission of FeCl3 for
the purpose of removing methane could be cost-effective, and that compared to iron from
shipping combustion, direct FeCl3 emissions are likely to be more efficient, while having less uncertainties. van Herpen et al. (2023) reported the removal of 7.5 g of CH4 per
g of photoactive iron in North Atlantic mineral dust/sea spray aerosols per day, with approximately 2% of iron in mineral dust being photo-active. Assuming that a shipping
fuel additive such as ferrocene (ca. 117$ per kg Fe (Chemistry, 2024), see Table 6) also
results in 2% photo-active iron (which is a pessimistic assumption, because shipping iron
emissions are expected to have relatively high solubility (Ito, 2013)), and assuming a 5
day particle lifetime, leads to a best-case cost-efficiency of $ 4,300 - 5,500 per ton CO2 e.
However, researchers have also proposed to inject FeCl3 into shipping plumes or spray
it from ocean towers (Oeste et al., 2017; Ming et al., 2021), which implies 100% photoactive iron (50× improvement), and FeCl3 is 40× cheaper than ferrocene ($3 per kg Fe),
and could therefore bring costs down to levels below what is currently expected for atmospheric CO2 capture technologies (below $10 per Mg(metric ton) of CO2 e).

Estimated cost of ISA technologies

Estimates not available.
No additional equipment needed as iron is present as additive in fuel.

These are best-case cost estimates where global modeling of mineral dust showed that
CH4 was only removed efficiently above certain parts of the ocean, due to loss of O3 and
OH resulting in increasing CH4 lifetime (van Herpen et al., 2023). Pennacchio, van Herpen, et al. (2024) used box modeling to show that low intensity Cl generation, such as
by iron in a dispersed shipping plume, only decreases CH4 lifetime for very low or very
high background NOx concentrations (the precursor for O3 ). Because of this, conditions
in most of the Northern Hemisphere, and for most shipping routes, are unfavorable. Meidan
et al. (2024) used global modeling to show that a threshold amount of combustion iron
emissions from shipping are needed before removal of CH4 starts to occur. Based on the
assumption that the fraction of photoactive iron in the combustion emissions is low, the
paper finds that direct radiative forcing by the iron can cancel cooling from the reduction in CH4 and O3 . At the same time, the indirect cooling from the iron via for example cloud effects is potentially larger than the direct warming effect, but is highly uncertain. If emitted iron is fully photo-active, these concerns and uncertainties about iron
radiative forcing are strongly reduced, as 50× less material would be needed.
Sulfate aerosol chemistry is reported to partly inhibit chlorine production from iron
salt aerosols (Wittmer, Bleicher, & Zetzsch, 2015; Wittmer, Bleicher, Ofner, & Zetzsch,
2015; Mikkelsen et al., 2024). To account for sulphate chemistry in our model, we would
need to include aqueous chemistry that accounts for the interaction between Fe(II) and
SO2−
4 in the aerosol phase, which is beyond the scope of this study. Wittmer measured
in a smog chamber that the addition of 200 ppb SO2 decreased the Cl2 production by
30%. However, much lower SO2 concentrations of up to 1 ppb have been measured in
ship plumes (G. Chen et al. (2005)). According to Mikkelsen et al. (2024) aerosol sulfur chemistry will form iron sulfate complexes and partly inhibit the available iron for
the ISA mechanism. When modeling by Mikkelsen et al. (2024) included an aerosol mass
fraction of 50% SO24 −, which is 10 times the fraction of sea spray aerosols, it reduced
the formation of iron(III) chlorides by up to 40%. For high-sulfur fuels (above 0.5% sulfur), up to 50% SO24 − mass fraction was observed in particulate matter (Lack et al., 2009)),
but our study focuses on contemporary fuels with less than 0.5% sulfur (compliant with
new IMO sulfur regulations), which have orders of magnitude lower SO24 − fraction. Thus,
even in a high-sulfur scenario the reduction in Cl2 production might be up to 40%. This
uncertainty is low in view of the uncertainty in the cycling rate for Cl2 production (6
to 78 per hour), which means the added uncertainty of excluding aerosol sulfate chemistry in our model is negligible.
Based on our analysis, the detection of photo-active iron appears to be the most
sensitive approach to quantify the ISA chemistry, because it detects iron-salt aerosols
directly. It can be used for a wide range of distances, and even very low iron-salt aerosol
emissions are already detectable. However, this method does not detect Cl production

by these aerosols, so it is not a suitable method for a field test that studies the impact
of the Cl emissions.
There is a range of species that could detect Cl production from relatively low Fe
emissions and can be detected with CIMS. From the species we analyzed, Cl2 appears
the most sensitive to the Fe emissions and in a field study it may be most practical species
to measure, because according to the model the peak in Cl2 concentration would result
close to the emission point, which is a logistical advantage compared to some of the other
species that have their concentration peak tens of km downwind, making those observations more meteorology-dependent.
For NOx -polluted ship plumes, CIMS could also be used for ClNO3 , ClNO2 , and
to a lesser extent ClO and HOCl. CIMS detection of HOCl and ClO works better for
iron emissions without NOx , while ClNO2 is not detectable at all without NOx emissions
accompanying the iron-salt aerosols. While the radical clock method for Cl detection appears highly sensitive, we believe the applicability of this approach is limited due to the
entrainment of background air into the plume. However, we show for a radical clock with
CO and ethane that it is possible to account for this when the radical clock leverages
background air species.
While the use of CIMS seems the most suitable for low Fe emissions, a field study
might not be limited by the available Fe emission, making simpler and lower-cost techniques available. Sturtz’s environmental impact study (Sturtz et al., 2022) investigated
Fe emissions up to 0.21 g/s and identified no significant impacts. Further impact studies are needed to show whether our highest scenario of 2.1 g/s would be safe for a field
study.
For high Fe emissions of 0.21 g/s and above, the ratio of CO:ethane has the advantage that low-cost spectroscopic methods could be used to generate real-time and highresolution data that is closely related to Cl chemistry. The use of flask measurements
for analysis of δ 13 C(CO) has the great advantage that it gives a direct quantification of
the amount of methane removed by Cl. DOAS methods are also possible with high Fe
emissions. For example, MAX-DOAS could be used to measure the double-peak of CH2 O
along the center line, or at very high Fe emissions even satellite detection might be possible. With LP-DOAS a ClO signal could be measured for a high Fe emission, especially
for Fe emissions without NOx .
This study did not investigate the influence of anthropogenic emissions on natural mineral dust/salt aerosols (van Herpen et al., 2023). Anthropogenic pollution can increase the acidity of particles which is likely to increase the release of iron from mineral
particles by weathering and will shift aqueous equilibria towards the formation of ironchloride chromophores, overall increasing Cl production and methane removal. In addition, anthropogenic NOx emissions into mineral dust clouds can shift the secondary
atmospheric chemistry into conditions favorable for methane removal (Pennacchio, van
Herpen, et al., 2024).
Pennacchio, van Herpen, et al. (2024) showed that high Cl2 emissions of above 1×106
Cl2 /(cm3 s) always leads to a net decrease of methane’s lifetime, and that lower Cl2 emissions can lead to a methane lifetime increase for specific NOx conditions. A question is
what Fe emission is needed for the Cl2 production to remain above 1 × 106 Cl2 /(cm3
s), even for a fully dispersed plume. Bearing in mind that multi-day plume modeling is
better done in a global model that includes meteorology, we still examined our model
output for an initial estimate. For our most stable plume scenario A, our highest Fe emission of 2 g/s resulted in Cl2 production of 1×104 Cl2 /(cm3 s) with peak sunlight conditions after 5 days of dispersion. This suggests that more than 100× higher Fe emission is needed (above 200 g/s) to remain in the high ClOx regime during the entire dispersion of the plume. A question is whether such high Fe emissions and associated Cl2

Considering the urgency of addressing atmospheric methane concentrations to limit
global warming (Gorham et al., 2024), while natural methane emissions are on the rise
(Lan et al., 2024), there could be a role for the application of iron-salt aerosol as methane
removal technology, if it is proven safe and effective, and if effective governance is in place.
Safety and efficiency questions will require field studies that quantify Cl production from
iron-salt aerosol emissions. Because ISA emissions can also lead to methane lifetime increase (Pennacchio, van Herpen, et al., 2024; van Herpen et al., 2023; Meidan et al., 2024;
Li et al., 2023), quantification methods could also support governance.
We identified several potential techniques to quantify Cl production by ISA in plumes,
ranging from CIMS detection (of ClNO3 , HOCl, ClO, ClNO2 ), spectroscopic detection
of CO:ethane ratio, DOAS detection of CH2 O and ClO and isotopic analysis of δ 13 C(CO).
The hypothetical field study for which Sturtz et al. (2022) performed an environmental impact analysis, could demonstrate Cl production from FeCl3 emissions using the
relatively simple method of measuring CO:ethane ratio from a fixed position, or measuring the amount of photoactive iron in the plume, but most likely will need to use a
CIMS to detect species like Cl2 , ClNO3 and ClNO2 . DOAS is not likely to work for this
field study. Alternatively, the environmental impact analysis should be done for 10× higher
Fe emissions, so that other more low-cost techniques can be employed.

Fe emission of 0.21 g/s emission), in comparison with the Song et al. (2010) results for a similar scenario, showing good agreement between the models. Differences are attributed mainly to
differences in the dispersion rate of the plume and the addition of Cl chemistry into our model.

Appendix C Model Setup
For the photolysis rates from the MCM subset, the solar zenith angle was set to
1.05 radians, corresponding to the first of June 2023 at 12:00 noon on Barbados. For all
other photolysis rates the NCAR TUV calculator (Madronich et al., 2002) has been used
to determine the rates for the 12th of November 1996, at 10◦ N 25◦ W. In the model, these
photolysis rates were multiplied with a number between 0 and 1 that represents a diurnal profile. These input conditions were used to be comparable with van Herpen et al.
(2023).
The model was run at 298 K with 70% RH and concentrations of: H2 O = 5.39 ×1017
cm , O2 = 3.94 ×1018 cm−3 , H2 = 1.23 ×1010 cm−3 , HCl = 2.55 ×109 cm−3 , DMS
= 1.40 ×109 cm−3 and CH4 = 4.43 ×1013 cm−3 . All these concentrations were set as
constants except for CH4 . NOx was set using a first-order emission of NO2 , and to set
different background O3 concentrations we either added a first-order emission of O(3P),
or we added an extra first order loss rate (by increasing O3 deposition rate). For the sensitivity analysis, bromine concentrations were set using a first order emission of 400 cm− 3
s− 1 Br2 .
