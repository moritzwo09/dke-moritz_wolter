Abstract
Cationic surfactants are widely used in various applications, making their environmental
behavior a critical concern. However, soil sorption studies at environmentally relevant submicromolar
concentrations remain scarce. In this study, sorption isotherms of five benzalkonium compounds
(BACs) and two dialkyldimethylammonium compounds on kaolinite under dilute conditions were
determined using a conventional batch-shaking and centrifugation method. In addition, the feasibility
of using a polyacrylate (PA) fiber passive sampling method to measure freely dissolved surfactant
concentrations in kaolinite suspensions was investigated. All kaolinite sorption isotherms were
nonlinear (Freundlich exponent, 0.51–0.68), even at low surfactant concentrations (< 0.2% of the
cationic exchange capacity), suggesting high sorption site heterogeneity. The kaolinite–water sorption
coefficients (Kkao/w) of BACs in an isosteric condition increased with alkyl chain length; however, the
incremental increase in log Kkao/w per -C2H4- unit varied with chain length, further indicating
heterogeneous sorption sites. Kaolinite sorption isotherms measured using passive sampling were
comparable to those measured by direct sampling. PA fiber fouling by kaolinite particles and the high
isotherm nonlinearity of PA sorption at high concentrations were identified as major sources of error.

1. Introduction
Cationic surfactants are used in a wide range of applications such as fabric softeners, cosmetics, hair
care products, and disinfectants. Because removal by wastewater treatment is incomplete,1 cationic
surfactants have been widely detected in the aquatic environment.2-4 Toxicity to aquatic organisms is
relatively high; studies have shown that submicromolar concentrations (i.e., < ~100 μg/L) in water
can cause toxicity to a number of aquatic organisms.5-7 Research on their environmental fate and
distribution is therefore highly needed.7
Sorption is a particularly important process for cationic surfactants because the surface of
natural materials such as soils and sediments is often negatively charged. Past studies have indicated
that cation exchange is the primary mechanism of soil sorption of cationic surfactants.8 Natural
organic matter and clay minerals are the main contributors to soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) and
are thus expected to play the major role in the sorption of organic cations.9 There are many studies
in the literature on the sorption of cationic surfactants by clay minerals, reporting on various aspects
such as the influence of surfactant and clay mineral types, coexisting solutes, temperature, and pH
on sorption, as reviewed by Ishiguro and Koopal.10 While previous studies investigated sorption over
a wide range of surfactant concentrations,11-18 the range was usually from μM to mM, with emphasis
on a high region, around the adsorbent CEC or even up to the surfactant critical micelle concentration
(CMC). This may be because clay sorption exhibits characteristic shifts passing through the CEC and
CMC,19,20 which have been a focus of research. The use of analytical techniques with low sensitivity
may also be a factor limiting the concentration range. However, to understand the environmental
behavior of these contaminants, knowledge of the sorption behavior at sub-μM concentrations is
required, as this is the range typically found in aqueous environments and reported as the toxicity
threshold.
In batch sorption experiments, particles and water are typically separated by centrifugation
or filtration after sorption equilibrium has been reached. For hydrophobic (i.e., strongly sorbing)
substances, incomplete separation of small, colloidal particles from water can lead to an
overestimation of the truly dissolved concentration in water and thus to a significant error in the
evaluation of sorption characteristics. In recent decades, equilibrium passive sampling methods using
polymeric samplers such as a solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber have been increasingly used
for sorption studies.21-23 Passive sampling methods can avoid direct sampling of water and thus avoid
experimental problems associated with phase separation. However, few studies have attempted to
use a passive sampling method to investigate the sorption behavior of cationic surfactants.24,25
The purpose of this study was twofold: to investigate the equilibrium sorption of varying
structures of cationic surfactants by kaolinite at relatively low solute concentrations; and to explore
the possibility of using a SPME fiber passive sampling method to measure freely dissolved
concentrations in kaolinite suspensions. To this end, batch sorption experiments were performed
using a conventional batch-shaking and centrifugation method to determine sorption isotherms of

five benzalkonium compounds (BACs) and two dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs) on
kaolinite. Both classes of cationic surfactants are widely used as disinfectants and preservatives.
Based on the experimental results, the influence of molecular structure on kaolinite sorption was
discussed. In parallel to the conventional method, sorption isotherms were measured by the passive
sampling method using polyacrylate (PA) fiber as a sampler. The validity of this passive method was
evaluated in comparison with the conventional centrifuge method.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals
Benzylhexyldimethylammonium chloride (C6-BAC), benzyldimethyloctylammonium chloride (C8BAC), and benzyldecyldimethylammonium chloride (C10-BAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis,
MO,
US).
Benzyldodecyldimethylammonium
chloride
dihydrate
(C12-BAC),
benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium chloride hydrate (C14-BAC), dimethyldioctylammonium
bromide (C8-C8-DADMAC), and didecyldimethylammonium chloride (C10-C10-DADMAC) were from
Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). The purity of these chemicals was >96%. (2,3,4,5,6D5)benzyldimethyldecylammonium
chloride
(d5-C10-BAC),
(2,3,4,5,6D5)benzyldimethyldodecylammonium
chloride
(d5-C12-BAC),
and
dodecyldimethyl(D25)dodecylammonium bromide (d25-C12-C12-DADMAC) were purchased from CDN
Isotopes Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Canada). LC grade 1 M ammonium acetate and LC/MS grade water,
acetonitrile, and isopropanol were obtained from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation (Osaka,
Japan) and used for LC/MS analysis. Powder of NaCl and CaCl2 as well as 1 M NaOH solution were also
obtained from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. Tap water was treated with reverse osmosis,
further purified with an Ultrapure Water System (RFU665DA, Advantec, Tokyo, Japan), and used for
conditioning of kaolinite and batch sorption experiments. All glassware was baked at 450 °C for 4 h to
remove organic residues.

2.2. Kaolinite
A reference sample of kaolinite (JCSS-1101b, from Kanpaku, Utsunomiya, Japan) was obtained from
the Clay Science Society of Japan. For this sample, a specific surface area of 14.82 m2/g for this was
reported, as determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method.26 In addition, Ikegami et al.27
measured a cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 62 meq/kg.
Exchangeable cations on kaolinite were replaced by Na+ using NaCl, as follows. Four 50-mL
polypropylene centrifuge tubes (IWAKI, AGC Techno Glass, Yoshida, Japan) each received 2 g of
kaolinite and 50 mL of 1 M NaCl aqueous solution. These tubes were roller-shaken overnight at 60
rpm using a Mix Rotor VMR-5R (AS ONE, Osaka, Japan) and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min using an
S700T centrifuge (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant was removed, and the remaining slurries
were washed four more times with 50 mL of 1 M NaCl for 3–4 h each time. The slurries were then

washed with 50 mL of water for 1 h and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min. The slurries were washed
two more times with water and centrifuged at 2000g for 30 min. The final supernatant was collected
and measured for electrical conductivity using a LAQUAtwin AS-771 conductivity meter (Horiba, Kyoto,
Japan), which resulted in 2.7–2.9 mS/m (~0.3 mM NaCl). The remaining slurries were frozen at −30°C
and freeze-dried (FDU-1200, EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain dry powder of Na-kaolinite. For
convenience, this Na-kaolinite will be referred to as kaolinite.

2.3. Polyacrylate (PA)-coated solid phase microfiber
A PA-coated glass microfiber with a coating thickness of 7 μm from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix,
AZ) was obtained by courtesy of Dr. Michiel Jonker, Utrecht University. This fiber was from the same
lot as used in our previous studies.25,28 The PA fiber was cut into 3 cm pieces, immersed in methanol
containing 1% (v/v) formic acid for 1 h, rinsed with excess water, and stored in water until use. A
coating volume of 2.7 μL/m was used to derive the volume-based concentration in PA.

2.4. Batch sorption experiments
An aqueous solution of 15 mM NaCl containing a predetermined amount of NaOH (~0.04 mmol per
L) was aerated and used. The amount of NaOH was adjusted to give a pH of 7 when the solution was
equilibrated with atmospheric CO2. A stock of kaolinite suspension at pH 7 was prepared in the same
way with 15 mM NaCl solution and a predetermined amount of NaOH (~0.15 mmol per L). The pH
was checked regularly with a pH electrode (LAQUA 9615S-10D, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) and was
confirmed to be 7.0 ± 0.2. An aqueous stock solution of a single cationic surfactant was prepared by
dissolving the pure substance in the 15 mM NaCl solution, which was diluted in one or two steps to 6
lower concentration stocks. No solvent carrier was used to avoid a possible influence on sorption.
For each test, 30 polypropylene (PP) microtubes (1.5 mL) were used, 14 of which received
1100 μL of kaolinite suspension, 100 μL of one of the aqueous stocks of the target cationic surfactant,
and 1–2 pieces of 3 cm PA fiber. The kaolinite concentration was 4.6–18.3 mg/mL. Seven
concentration levels of cationic surfactant were prepared in duplicate. In parallel, 14 PP tubes
containing 15 mM NaCl solution and PA fiber, but without kaolinite, were also prepared to investigate
the sorption of the cationic surfactant by the PA fiber. These no-kaolinite tubes also serve as controls
to check the sorption of cationic surfactants to the tube walls. The remaining two tubes served as
blanks, one with and one without kaolinite. All tubes were roller-shaken overnight, or up to 24 h, in
an incubator at 25°C. Preliminary experiments with C8-BAC showed that equilibrium was reached
within 3 h (Figure S1). Tubes were centrifuged for 15–30 min at 10,000 rpm (~4000g) using a ChibitanII Microcentrifuge (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The supernatant was pipetted into a glass vial.
The fiber was collected with stainless-steel tweezers, wiped with Kim-wipe, transferred to a glass vial,
and extracted with acetonitrile. For C12 and C14-BACs and both DADMACs, the sedimented kaolinite
was extracted with acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid for 1 h, followed by centrifugation for 15
min. For shorter chain BACs (C6, C8, C10), kaolinite was not analyzed and the concentration sorbed
to kaolinite was estimated from the mass balance calculation. The loss to the tube wall was assumed
5
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-12vzq ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8702-1602 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

to be log-linearly related to Cw, estimated from the results of the no-kaolinite vials, and included in
the mass balance calculation. The loss estimated this way was 1–13% of the C6, C8, and C10-BACs
added to kaolinite suspensions and had only a small contribution to the mass balance.
For C12-BAC, the sorption experiment was also conducted with 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM
CaCl2 solutions. The experimental procedure was the same as described above.

2.5. Data evaluation
The data from the sorption tests were fitted with the log-transformed Freundlich model.
log Ckao = nFr,kao log Cw + log KFr,kao (1)
where Ckao (μmol/kg) and Cw (μM) are the concentrations of the cationic surfactant in kaolinite and
water, respectively, at equilibrium. KFr,kao and nFr,kao are the Freundlich coefficient and exponent,
respectively. The kaolinite/water sorption coefficient (L/kg) is defined as Kkao/w = Ckao/Cw. Similarly, the
Freundlich equation was fitted to the measured surfactant concentration in PA [CPA (μM)] and Cw.
log CPA = nFr,PA log Cw + log KFr,PA
(2)
where KFr,PA and nFr,PA are the respective Freundlich parameters for PA. As shown below, the PA–water
sorption isotherms slightly deviated from eq 2. Hence, for the purpose of interpolation, the following
Langmuir–Freundlich equation was fitted to the data.
𝑛LF,PA

𝐶PA =

𝑞max,PA 𝐾LF,PA 𝐶w

where qmax,PA, KLF,PA and nLF,PA are the maximal sorbed concentration, Langmuir–Freundlich coefficient,
and Langmuir–Freundlich exponent, respectively. These parameters were calibrated with the CPA and
Cw data obtained in the absence of kaolinite. Solving eq 3 for Cw, we obtain,
𝐶w = (𝐾

Equation 4 was used to obtain the passive-sampling-derived Cw from the measured CPA in kaolinite
suspensions. Equation 4 was only used within the calibrated range of concentrations.

2.6. Instrumental analysis
BACs and DADMACs in solutions were quantified using a liquid chromatography (LC) system (1260
Infinity II) equipped with a single quadrupole mass selective detector (MSD) (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). All samples were spiked with an internal standard and diluted as necessary. A Kinetex
EVO C18 column (2.6 µm particle size, 2.1 mm i.d. × 50 mm) was used for separation. Gradient elution
was performed using aqueous ammonium acetate solution (10 mM), acetonitrile, and isopropanol as
eluents. All compounds were measured with m/z values corresponding to their molecular masses.
Further details of the LC and MSD conditions are provided in the Electronic Supplementary Material,
S-1. The peak area of the target chemical relative to that of the internal standard (d5-C10-BAC for C6-,
C8-, and C10-BACs, d5-C12-BAC for C12- and C14-BACs, and d25-C12-C12-DADMAC for C8-C8- and C10C10-DADMACs) was used for quantification. Calibration standards were prepared in the
concentration range of 1 to 100 µg/L using acetonitrile.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Sorption isotherms of BACs and DADMACs on kaolinite
The measured sorption isotherms of cationic surfactants on kaolinite using the conventional method
are shown in Figure 1. To our knowledge, such an extensive set of sorption isotherms on kaolinite at
low surfactant loading levels (Ckao < 1000 µmol/kg) has not been reported in the literature. All
isotherms obtained were nonlinear even at Ckao < 100 µmol/kg (i.e., < 0.2% of CEC), with nFr,kao = 0.51–
0.68 (Table 1). The Freundlich equation fits the data well, and there was no clear indication of surface
saturation or cooperative sorption, which is consistent with the fact that the concentrations studied
(< 10 mmol/kg) were below the CEC of the kaolinite sample (i.e., 62 meq/kg).27
The sorption of cationic chemicals by kaolinite at low solute loading is considered cation
exchange,13,15 which is characterized by a selectivity coefficient for a given cation and follows a linear
isotherm. In fact, models used to fit measured isotherms assume linearity at low surfactant
concentrations.13,19 However, closer examination of the literature data shows that linearity at low
concentrations does not always hold true. For example, Xu and Boyd reported that the sorption
isotherm of hexadecyltrimethylammonium by Na-kaolinite in the presence of 42 mM NaCl was linear
up to the sample CEC, but nonlinear at 2 mM NaCl.13 Kaolinite sorption isotherms of denatonium
reported by Crosson et al. were linear when K+ was the background cation, whereas they were
nonlinear with Ca2+ and Na+.17 Droge and Goss29 conducted column retention experiments with
various organic cations and concluded that the sorption coefficient was generally concentrationindependent, i.e., the sorption isotherm was linear (n ~ 1) on clay minerals including kaolinite.
However, their individual data show that the sorption nonlinearity varies for individual compounds
(e.g., nFr = 0.67–1.00 for quaternary ammoniums). Brownawell et al.8 reported that the sorption of
dodecylpyridinium on Borden Sand was extensively nonlinear (n = 0.58) even in the low concentration
range. Overall, it cannot be generally concluded that the sorption of cationic surfactant by kaolinite
is linear even at low concentrations. Therefore, it is sensible not to extrapolate sorption characteristics
to concentrations outside the tested range.
A nonlinear isotherm is a manifestation of surface heterogeneity in terms of sorption sites.
We speculate that the deprotonated silanol (Si-O−) and the hydrophobic siloxane (Si-O-Si) are
heterogeneously distributed on the silica tetrahedral facet, forming diverse sorption sites with a range
of interaction properties. Recent atomic force microscopy studies have shown that the surface of the
silica tetrahedral layer has a pH-dependent charge that is negative at pH > 4.30,31 Thus, deprotonated
surface functional groups are present and may contribute to the surface heterogeneity.
The isotherms shown in Figure 1 indicate that the kaolinite sorption of a longer-chain
compound was always stronger than that of a shorter-chain analogue; e.g., the isotherm for C12-BAC
is to the upper left of that for C10-BAC. The isotherms for C10-BAC and C8-C8-DADMAC are close to
each other, as are the isotherms for C14-BAC and C10-C10-DADMAC, the respective compounds with
4 more C atoms. The sorption strength of kaolinite for cationic surfactants is further discussed in

The type and concentration of inorganic salt dissolved in water affected the sorption
isotherms of C12-BAC on kaolinite (Figure 2). An NaCl concentration of 150 mM resulted in weaker
sorption by kaolinite (i.e., lower Kkao/w) than 15 mM. An increase in the competing cation (Na+)
suppressed the sorption of C12-BAC, which is typical of ion exchange sorption. However, a 10-fold
difference in NaCl concentration resulted in a much smaller difference in sorption strength; thus,
comparing isotherms with 15 and 150 mM NaCl, Kkao/w was only 1.8 times different at Cw = 1 μM of
C12-BAC and only 3 times different at Ckao = 100 μmol/kg of C12-BAC. This is inconsistent with what
would be expected from the law of mass action based on the 1:1 exchange of Na+ and C12-BAC cation.

In contrast to our results, Droge and Goss29 reported that a 10-fold increase in NaCl concentration
resulted in a 10-fold decrease in Kkao/w for organic cations, consistent with the 1:1 exchange
hypothesis. It is likely that the kaolinite sample used in the literature29 had a different property than
that used in this work. Differences in sorption properties between kaolinite samples have been
reported previously for nonionic surfactants.32 The data in Figure 2 demonstrate that 5 mM CaCl2 is
equivalent to 150 mM NaCl as a cation exchange competitor to C12-BAC. The stronger suppression of
sorption by divalent Ca2+ than by monovalent Na+ has been reported,17 and the comparative
competitive effects of 5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM NaCl are consistent with results for illite and bentonite
in the literature.29

Figure 2. Salt-dependence of C12-BAC sorption on kaolinite (pH 7, 25°C).

3.2. Comparison of log Kkao/w values
Log Kkao/w values of cationic surfactants were calculated from the isotherm data. Since the isotherms
were nonlinear, the resulting log Kkao/w values were concentration-dependent, spanning over 1–2 log
units for each cationic surfactant (Figure 3). To compare different surfactants, log Kkao/w values in an
isosteric condition (i.e., at a constant Ckao) were interpolated using the Freundlich equation.
The log Kkao/w of BACs at low concentration (Ckao = 100 μmol/kg) increased with alkyl chain
length, but the increase in log Kkao/w per -CH2- varied with chain length. For example, log Kkao/w
increases by only 0.2 log units from C6-BAC to C8-BAC but by 0.8 log units from C12-BAC to C14-BAC.
There are two possible explanations for these results. First, BACs sorb to different sorption sites of
kaolinite depending on the chain length, or they sorb to the same sorption sites but in different
arrangement. That is, long-chain BACs can better find sorption sites where both the positively charged
head and the hydrophobic tail can interact with the kaolinite surface, whereas short-chain BACs may
9

not be able to optimize both types of interactions simultaneously. The heterogeneous distribution of
charged functional groups and hydrophobic siloxane segments, as discussed above, could explain
such a misfit for short-chain BACs. Wang et al.15 reported that the length of the shorter alkyl chain of
double-chain cationic surfactants affects sorption much less than the length of the alkyl chain of a
single-chain cationic surfactant, also suggesting the influence of molecular shape on kaolinite–
cationic surfactant interactions. The second possibility is that organic impurities in the kaolinite
sample increased the sorption of long-chain BACs. The carbon content of the kaolinite sample in this
study was measured using an elemental analyzer (Flash EA1112, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was
found to be 0.03 wt%, which was below the method limit of quantification (0.1 wt%). Nevertheless,
reported organic carbon/water partition coefficients (Koc, L/kg) are high, particularly for long-chain
BACs (>C12), e.g., 4.5–6.8 log units for different natural organic matter.24,29 If the log Koc of C12-BAC
is say 6, even 0.03 wt% organic carbon could contribute significantly to the total sorption capacity of
the current kaolinite sample. Thermal or chemical pretreatment of the kaolinite sample to remove
organic residues prior to the sorption experiment would provide additional insight into the role of
impurities in sorption, but such treatment will inevitably modify the surface of the kaolinite.
The log Kkao/w values measured in this study are compared to those reported in the literature
(Figure 3). The log Kkao/w data from this study agree well with the data from Ndabambi and Kwon33
and Wang et al.15 This agreement is encouraging, but it may be a coincidence because these studies
adopted different salt concentrations, pH values, and surfactant loading levels (see Figure 3 caption).
These factors can have opposite effects on Kkao/w and cancel each other out. Note that Ndabambi and
Kwon33 also reported Kkao/w values of 4.12–7.48 for C8- to C18-BACs measured using algal toxicity
responses. These values are substantially higher than any of the other measurements and are not
plotted in Figure 3. The Kkao/w values from Droge and Goss29 were measured using a column retention
method with a water composition similar to that of the current study. However, their log Kkao/w values
were ~1 log unit higher than our values. In the literature, a factor of ~5 difference in sorption capacity
between kaolinite samples of different origin has been reported for nonionic surfactant,32 and the
result of the current study shows an even larger difference. It is interesting to note that in ref 29,
benzyltrimethylammonium (C1-BAC) had a log Kkao/w value only 0.2 lower than that of C6-BAC, even
though C1-BAC is five C atoms shorter than C6-BAC. This result is also consistent with the notion that
the alkyl chain must be long enough to interact optimally with the kaolinite surface.

3.3. PA–water partitioning of BACs and DADMACs
Before discussing the results of the passive sampling method, we explore the sorption
characteristics of the PA fiber for cationic surfactants. The PA–water sorption isotherm for C6-BAC
was nearly linear, whereas the isotherms for the other BACs became increasingly nonlinear with
increasing alkyl chain length (Figure 4). The influence of alkyl chain length on sorption was generally
greater for PA than for kaolinite. The isotherms were curved in the log-log plot and thus slightly
deviated from the Freundlich equation (see all fitted parameters in Tables S1, S2). The isotherm
nonlinearity was particularly high (nFr,PA < 0.5) above CPA = 1,000 μM for any compound. The higher
nonlinearity observed for long-chain compounds may be due, at least in part, to the higher CPA levels
investigated in this study. The observed nonlinearity of PA sorption was similar to that reported for
C12-BAC in the previous study.25 As with the kaolinite shown above, the PA–water isotherms for C10BAC and C8-C8-DADMAC overlapped, as did the isotherms for C14-BAC and C10-C10-DADMAC. These
two pairs of cationic surfactants appear to have similar sorption properties.
Salt type and concentration affect the PA sorption of C12-BAC in a manner similar to kaolinite
sorption (Figure S2). That is, KPAw at 150 mM NaCl was lower than that at 15 mM NaCl by a factor of

2–3, depending on how the nonlinear isotherms were compared. Isotherms of 150 mM NaCl and 5
mM CaCl2 were similar within a factor of 2.
The presence of kaolinite in water had negligible or only small effects on the PA–water
sorption isotherms, as shown in Figure 4, where the data points in the presence of kaolinite (open
symbols) are mostly within the 95% prediction interval of the Langmuir–Freundlich model fitted to
the data in the absence of kaolinite. Exceptions are C6 and C8-BACs. For these short-chain BACs, the
presence of kaolinite increased the sorption of BACs by PA by up to a factor of 2. Since the passive
sampling method assumes no influence of suspended material on the PA sorption parameters, this
variation of PA sorption will cause an error in Cw. The increase in PA sorption for C6 and C8-BACs can
be explained by the kaolinite particles adhering to the PA surface, which were co-extracted and
increased the apparent (measured) CPA. This increase in CPA is only significant for C6- and C8-BACs
because PA sorption is weak relative to kaolinite sorption for these short-chain BACs. Figure 5 directly
compares Ckao and CPA in the kaolinite suspension at equilibrium and shows that PA sorption is
generally stronger than kaolinite sorption, but that the difference is small or absent for C6- and C8BACs. Kaolinite fouling on the PA surface has a negligible effect on CPA for the other cationic surfactants
because the adherent kaolinite particles hold only a small amount of these surfactants compared to
the PA fiber.

Solid lines indicate the fit of the Langmuir–Freundlich equation (eq 4), and bands indicate the 95%

avoid a crowded plot. One outlier was removed from the C6-BAC data (not shown).

3.4. Passive sampling for determination of sorption isotherms
The kaolinite–water sorption isotherms of BACs and DADMACs measured by the PA passive sampling
method are compared to the directly measured isotherms (Figure 6). Overall, the isotherms measured
by the two methods are in agreement. The data measured by the passive sampling method mostly
fall within the 95% prediction intervals of the isotherm derived from the direct method (Figure S3).
The passive sampling method overestimated C6 and C8-BAC (i.e., underestimated sorption by
kaolinite), which is related to the influence of kaolinite on PA sorption as discussed above. For the
other substances, passive sampling also tended to give similar or slightly higher Cw than direct
sampling. Since any suspended kaolinite particles remaining in water after centrifugation would
increase the directly measured Cw, the current results suggest that centrifugation effectively removed
kaolinite and that direct measurement of water was not significantly affected by residual kaolinite.
There was some increased data variation for long-chain compounds such as C10-C10DADMAC particularly at high concentrations. This result illustrates a weakness of the current
approach; PA fiber sorption is increasingly nonlinear with surfactant concentration, and therefore, in
the high concentration range, a small error in measured CPA results in a large variation in calculated
Cw. That is to say, at high concentrations, nLF,PA is low, and the exponent of eq 4 (i.e., 1/nLF,PA) is high,
which augments the errors in CPA and the sorption parameters, leading to an increased uncertainty in
Cw. In addition, when CPA is high and close to qmax,PA, the denominator of eq 4 approaches 0, and the
estimation of Cw from CPA becomes unstable.

4. Conclusion
Sorption isotherms of cationic surfactants on kaolinite are nonlinear even at low solute loading
conditions, indicating the heterogeneity of the sorption sites. Even in the concentration range well
below CEC, sorption coefficients measured at a high concentration cannot represent those at lower
concentrations. This result has implications for the transport, bioavailability, and toxicity of cationic
surfactants in the environment. The nonlinear increase in sorption coefficient with alkyl chain length
implies complicated mechanisms of kaolinite–cationic surfactant interactions. Further investigations
with kaolinite samples of different origin or different pretreatment as well as with other (clay)
minerals would shed more light on the mechanisms.
Passive sampling with PA fiber provided similar isotherms of cationic surfactants as direct
sampling. Fouling with kaolinite particles and high isotherm nonlinearity at high concentrations may
cause increased errors in PA fiber measurements. For kaolinite under the studied conditions,
conventional centrifugation appeared to be effective in removing particles from suspension and may
be more convenient than passive sampling for the compounds studied. Despite the limitations noted,
passive sampling was useful in verifying the results of the conventional method in this study and could
serve as an alternative method in other cases.
