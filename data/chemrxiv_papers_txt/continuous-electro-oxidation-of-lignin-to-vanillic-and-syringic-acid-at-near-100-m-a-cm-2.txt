Abstract
The use of lignin as a renewable feedstock for valuable chemicals has gained significant
momentum due to the ongoing depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the environmental harm
caused by their overuse. However, extracting useful products from this recalcitrant biopolymer
requires a highly selective fragmentation process. This article demonstrates that such a process
can be effectively achieved through an electrochemical approach. While Ni- and Co-based
catalysts have been previously employed for lignin electrooxidation, the optimal composition of
mixed metal oxyhydroxides—crucial for achieving higher yields and faradaic efficiencies—has
not been thoroughly investigated until now. This optimization was made possible by a
comprehensive study beginning with lignin model compounds, which elucidated the reaction
mechanism and facilitated the subsequent scaling of the reaction using organosolv pine lignin.
Remarkably, this approach yielded up to 6.0 wt% vanillic acid. These unprecedented results were
achieved through the meticulous design of an electrochemical flow cell, ensuring that the
electrochemical production of lignin monomers is not only cost-effective and selective but also
easily scalable.

Introduction
Chemical industry has been supplied with petrol-derived feedstocks, but the depletion of fossil
reserves and the instability derived from market fluctuation highlighted the urgent need to seek
renewable resources as carbon source. In this sense, lignocellulosic biomass, such as forestry
and agriculture residues, which is the most abundant renewable resource of organic carbon1,2has
been proposed as an alternative. This raw material comprises carbohydrates (cellulose and
hemicellulose) and a polymer-rich in aromatics (lignin). Over the years, cellulose has been widely
valorized in cellulose pulping processes for paper manufacturing. However, lignin waste is
discarded in this process and used as a low-grade fuel to obtain heat and energy or low-value
resins and lubricants2–5. Nevertheless, given its structure, rich in aromatic units derived from phydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) motifs, this biopolymer could be the
replacement of fossil reserves for the obtention of high-value aromatics compounds useful as
chemical feedstock in several industrial sectors.5–8.However, lignin’s amorphous tridimensional
structure is composed subunits crosslinked by C–C and C–O–C bonds 9–12, being β–O–4 ether
bonds the most abundant (45–60% of the total linkages)11,12 this recalcitrant structure supposes
a great challenge for achieving a selective and cost-efficient fragmentation without deteriorating
useful structures. For this reason, the main aim of this research is the selective Cα-Cβ oxidative
cleavage of this structure to produce, mainly, vanillic and syringic acids.
In recent years, different technologies have been developed for lignin depolymerization,
including i) biological, ii) thermal, and iii) chemical catalytic methods1–4. However, these methods
show numerous disadvantages that are difficult to solve. For example, thermal processes such
as pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, or microwave-assisted depolymerization require high
temperatures and/or pressures causing the destruction of valuable products by secondary
reactions and undesirable re-polymerization2,4,13,14, as well as being energetically inefficient.
Chemical catalytic methods (Base/Acid-Catalysis, oxidation, or Ionic Liquid-Assisted
depolymerization) typically require lower temperature and have better control over the reaction,
but requirement of using high pressures and the use of expensive catalysts and reagents greatly

increase the economic cost, which adds to the environmental hazards derived from the use of
unsafe chemical reagents.2,4,12,15. Finally, most of these problems could be solved using biological
depolymerization, which presents cost-effectiveness and specificity, but these methods are still
inefficient for large applications, having low reaction rates and yields4,16,17. Thus, a green
technology able to offer high yields and selectivity without compromising the safety and
economical cost is required, and in this sense is where electrochemistry comes into play.
Electrochemical technologies are most effective for controlling the reactions because it is
possible to work under mild conditions (room temperatures and pressures) and can be coupled
to other reactions, for example, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), increasing the global value
of the process and minimizing waste generation. Thus, we envisioned the use of a solid-state
catalyst as an electrode to the is directly oxidize lignin on the electrode surface1,18. This strategy
allows to easily recover and reuse the catalyst without contaminating the reaction mixture with
metals, which is especially relevant if the obtained products are intended to be use as raw
materials in the alimentary of pharmaceutical industries.
In literature, most research reported on this kind of catalyst for lignin electro-oxidation is
based on the use of IrO210,18–20, Pb/PbO218,21–24, Ni18,25–27 and Ni-Co9,18,28,29 alloys as anode showing
promising results. For instance, Smith et al.26 employed cylindrical nickel electrodes as anodes in
a flow reactor operating at 145°C, 5 bar, 8A (1.9 mA cm-2) for 3.5h. and a solution of NaOH 3 M
as reaction media and achieving the electro-oxidative conversion at laboratory scale of a
lignosulfonate (61gL-1) into vanillin. The yields obtained from this monomer were similar to those
obtained industrially using chemical oxidants (about 5.7% w/w). Other studies using Nickel
include those reported by Zirbes et al27. achieved yields of vanillin about 4.2 w/w using kraft
lignin (6gL-1), nickel foam as anode, an undivided stainless-steel cell and operating at 160°C, 10
mA cm2,6.5h. Moreover, Breiner et al.30 used a simple autoclave electrolysis cell and a planar
nickel anode to carry out high-temperature electrolysis of straw organosolv lignin (9gL-1)
operating to 180°C, 15 mA cm-2, obtaining 2.5% w/w vanillin and 1.8% w/w syringaldehyde as
monomer yields. However, these high temperatures and pressures make scaling up to an
industrially useful range a challenging task and economically noncompetitive. Therefore,
performing those reactions under ambient conditions (temperatures and pressures) is much
more desirable, but traditionally, the yields of vanillin and vanillic acid obtained by such methods
are very low31,32 (Table S1) reaching an apparent limit due to an equilibrium between the
formation of monomeric products, its concomitant oxidative destruction to CO2, and further
condensation of lignins. In this sense, Ghahremani et al.31 reported the lignin electrochemical
oxidation in the presence of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and Ni-Co bimetallic electrocatalysts at room
temperature, concluding that the rate of electrochemical oxidation of lignin is higher with Ni-Co
bimetallic electrocatalysts with higher Co contents. However, the obtained yields remained low
and the optimal Co content was not deeply surveyed, offering room for much improvement. In
this line, this study aims to optimize the metallic composition of an electrocatalyst to obtain
monomeric yields under ambient temperature and pressure conditions.
In addition, there are other problems to sort out: i) the competence with the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) that decreases the faradaic efficiency of the reaction, ii) mechanistic
studies to be able to understand and control the reactions and iii) the electrocatalyst
composition of active metals. Consequently, in the present research, a series of Fe1-x-yCoyNixOOH
samples were synthesized using an organometallic decomposition method and tested as
electrocatalysts for benzyl alcohol (BA) and 1-Phenylethanol (PEA) oxidation to the
corresponding carbonylic compounds to optimize the metallic composition required for
maximizing the catalytic activity while minimizing OER. Having determined the optimal
electrocatalyst (Ni0.75Co0.25OOH) a study of electrochemical oxidative cleavage of a series of lignin
dimeric models was performed, as well as with a polymeric lignin model which shed light on the
reaction mechanism. Finally, the depolymerization of organosolv lignin was achieved.

Results and Discussion
A series of 27 amorphous mixed-metal oxide films formulated as Fe1–y–xCoyNix(OH)2,
where y and z depend on the proportion of the three metals, were prepared by a process of
organometallic decomposition as described in the supporting, using Fluoride Tin Oxide Glass
(FTO) as conductor substrate33. These electrodes were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to
optimize the metal proportion of Fe-Ni-Co. Ni0.75Co0.25OOH electrocatalyst was initially evaluated
for electrochemical oxidation of Benzyl alcohol (BA), 1-phenylethanol (PEA), and lignin dimer 2
(entry 2, Table 1) (indicated in Table 1), typical lignin models compound with C(OH)-C structure.
The goal was to use BA as a simple lignin model to study the oxidation of the OH in Cα, PEA to
study the cleavage of the Cα-Cβ bond, and dimer to assess how effectively the β-O-4 linkage is
cleaved. As shown in Figure 1a, the CV curve of Ni0.75Co0.25(OH)2 shows an oxidation band
between 1,25-1,40 vs RHE that corresponds to the oxidation of Ni0.75Co0.25(OH)2 to
Ni0.75Co0.25OOH, the active phase33–36. Moreover, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) appears
in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with an onset overpotential of 290 mV. To our delight, introducing lignin
models into the electrolyte led to a significant reduction of onset potential, indicating the lower
energy barrier of these oxidations than that of OER37. The onset potential approximately
coincides with the electrochemical activation potential, which is why it appears to be the limiting
process for this type of electro-oxidation reaction. Next, the other 26 mixed-metal electrodes
were tested by CV to evaluate their performance of electrochemical oxidation of BA, PEA, dimer
2, and OER. Figure 1b shows a ternary diagram that presents the potential required to achieve 5
mA cm-2 current to OER. As can be seen, electrocatalysts with a similar proportion of Ni-Fe-Co
present the highest activity to OER performance38. Figures 1 c, d, and e display the potential
required to achieve 5 mA cm-2 current to lignin model oxidation and it is compared with OER
performance to analyze the reduction of onset potential. As shown, electrocatalysts with a high
OER performance exhibit relatively low lignin model oxidation activity. Thus, the best
electrocatalysts turned out to be CoyNixOOH (y=0-0.75, x=1-0.25) which shows that OER
response is relatively low. These results are positive because the proportion of metals can be
modulated to favor catalytic activity towards the desired products and minimize the competition
reaction (OER). In addition, the four best electrocatalysts were synthesized upon carbon felt (CF)
and tested in reaction (BA and PEA oxidation) by chronoamperometry at 1.5V vs RHE for 4 hours
(Figures S5-S9). Ni0.75Co0.25OOH manifesting the best electrochemical performance and the
highest product yields and faradaic efficiencies, was assigned as the optimal electrocatalyst. For
this reason, the rest of the experiments were carried out only with this electrocatalyst.

After optimization work, different lignin dimers with a β-O-4 linkage were tested to study
the fragmentation efficiency of the major bond present in the lignin structure (Table 1, entries
1,2,3). All dimers exhibit high conversion and yield towards the aromatic monomer with
carboxylic acid as major product39,40, which is the high-value monomeric species that we were
expecting to obtain. However, the other fragment that forms the dimer (catechol or guaiacol)
could not be detected by 1H-NMR. To study this setback, an experiment was carried out with
0.01M of guaiacol and/or catechol under the same reaction conditions. The results showed the
instability of guaiacol in oxidative conditions, since the 1H-NMR signals of these compounds
disappeared and others identical to those obtained in the oxidation reactions of the dimers
appeared (Figure S10). For this reason, we can conclude that these compounds decompose in
the reaction medium, evolving into other by-products. In the literaure41,42, different authors
report that electrooxidation of guaiacol produces different compounds derivates of maleic acid
and oxalic acid that could not be detected with our GC-MS analysis method.
On the other hand, Figure 2a presents a Kinetic reaction of dimer 2 electrooxidation to
determine conversion and product yield. As shown, after four hours most of the dimer (≈90%
conversion) has reacted, with a high yield toward p-anisic acid (≈84%). Furthermore, the figure
shows the chronoamperometry of lignin dimer oxidation at 1.5V vs RHE. The electrochemical
response is higher than the OER activity because of the reduction of onset potential. However,
the current decreases as the dimer is consumed, reaching values similar to OER after two hours,
when the conversion is approximately 80%.
Once β-O-4 linkages cleavage via dimeric models was studied, a model polymer (Pol G; entry
4, Table 1) formed solely by β-O-4 bonds connecting aromatic G structures (giving vanillin or
vanillic acid as the only product) was synthesized to analyze the depolymerization and
fragmentation of these linkages. This polymer was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) before and after 5 h of oxidation reaction (Figure
2b). The polymer chains are much smaller after the reaction (2-3 subunits mostly) compared to
about 19 subunits it initially contained. Nevertheless, GC-MS results show a low monomers yield
(≈5-6%). As shown in Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (2D-HSQC NMR) spectra43
before and after the reaction (Figure S15), this polymer appears to contain different β-β', α-O-γ'
and γ-O-α' bonds produced during its complex synthesis that are not fragmented, thus avoiding
significant production of monomers.

Moreover, the adsorption behavior of dimer 2 over Ni0.75Co0.25OOH/CF was studied by in-situ
FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 3a) to obtain information about the possible reaction mechanism44.
As shown in Figure 3b, when a low potential is applied, besides the band corresponding to the
skeletal vibration of the benzene ring (1504cm-1), new ones appear towards to lower
wavenumber (1410-1471cm-1). These variations may be attributed to the interaction between
Ni-Co and the benzene ring of the dimer that leads to the decrease of benzene symmetry, giving
rise to band shifting and splitting45. Furthermore, the ν(C−O) band disappears or is shifted to a
lower wavenumber, weakening the linkage46. This observation suggests an interaction between
the electrocatalyst surface and the oxygen linked to Cα (Cα-O). For this reason, it seems that the
dimer 2 is adsorbed by both the aromatic ring and Cα-O. Experiments integrated with Spinpolarized density functional theory (DFT) studies should be carried out to study which of the two
possible reaction mechanisms prevail.

Subsequently, the investigation focused on the depolymerization of lignin dioxasolv. Figure 4
displays the results of the HSQC before and after the reaction43,47,48. This technique allows
detecting signals that correspond to linkages in the lignin structure. The main interunit linkages
observed in the beech and pine lignins are β-O-4, β-5, β–β, α-O-γ and γ-O-α structures. As can
be seen in the aliphatic zone (Figure 4 a, c, e, and g), consequently to the depolymerization,
about 70% of β-O-4 linkages have disappeared while β-5, β–β, α-O-γ, and γ-O-α linkages remain

(as in the case of Pol G). Furthermore, the aromatic zone (Figure 4 b, d, f, and h) manifests beech
lignin presents both G and S aromatic units while pine lignin only contains G aromatic units
because beech wood is hardwood and pine wood is softwood. It should be noted that after the
reaction, there are a lot of signals of S2’’ and G2’’ due to most of the monomers obtained as
electrooxidation results, containing a carboxylic group at Cα. In this line, monomeric degradation
products were identified and quantified by GC-MS. As shown in Table 1, 4 h electrooxidation of
beech dioxasolv led to a yield of vanillic acid and syringic acid of 2.1% w/w and 3.2% w/w,
respectively, as majority products and 0.3 % w/w of vanillin and 0.5 % w/w of syringaldehyde as
minority products which is equivalent to a yield of 70% compared to the total amount of
monomers. Additionally, pine dioxasolv presents a yield of vanillic acid and vanillin of 5.1 % w/w
and 0.5 % w/w, respectively (65% vs total amount of monomers). Moreover, precipitated lignin
or unreacted lignin which were expected to have higher molecular weight and larger polarity
compared to those in the organic phase, was also investigated (Table 1). As could be seen with
the polymer, lignin chains are much smaller after the reaction (2-4 subunits for both beech and
pine) compared to about 12-17 subunits it initially contained.
Last, depolymerization of lignin dioxasolv was studied by a Redox Flow system, which on an
industrial scale would allow continuous work without stopping the reactor from isolating the
products49. Table 2 displays the results of the electrooxidation of lignin dioxasolv by
chronopotentiometry in a Redox Flow system. In the case of beech lignin, extraction yields of
80% and 76% are achieved for vanillic and syringic acid, respectively, which are equivalent to 3.3
and 3.9% w/w concerning the initial weight of lignin. Similarly, when lignin pine is used, yields of
74% are achieved to produce vanillic acid, which is equivalent to 6.0% w/w rivaling in both with
state-of-the-art but operating at room temperature26,27,50,51.

Figure 5 shows different chronopotentiometry of pine dioxasolv (1A and 250mA) with voltage
data, oxygen production, and the evolution of monomeric products. When 1A is applied (Figure
6a), higher yields are obtained in less time, producing around 5% w/w vanillic acid in 5 h.
However, there is a lot of oxygen production hence, the faradic efficiency would be lower. The
reason is that in a two-electrode system and working under chronopotentiometry there is no
control over the oxidation potential to avoid the competition reaction (OER), as was possible
with three-electrode system and chronoamperometry conditions. On the other hand, applying
250 mA, only 2.5% of vanillic acid is produced. Nevertheless, when the same coulombs have
been used (20 h), vanillic acid production reaches 6% w/w. Efficiencies are higher at lower
currents due to lower oxygen production and higher faradic efficiency. Moreover, the
vanillin/vanillic acid ratio varies with reaction time because vanillin is inevitably oxidized to
vanillic acid. For example, in 1 h to 1 A, there is 35% w/w vanillin compared to the total produced,
and at 5 hours, approximately 10%.

Conclusions
In this study, a lignin electrooxidation method from a series of amorphous mixed-metal
oxyhydroxides (Fe1-x-yCoyNixOOH) as electrocatalysts was developed. Initially, the optimization
work carried out to evaluate the C(OH)-C structure cleavage showed that Co, Ni oxyhydroxides
are the most active electrocatalysts, manifesting Ni0.75Co0.25OOH, the best electrochemical
performance and the highest product yields and faradaic efficiencies. In addition, it is possible
to avoid the OER competition reaction because lignin models and organolv lignin oxidation
present an earlier onset. In general, this method is capable of efficiently fragmenting the β-O-4
bonds of model lignin dimers and polymers (85%). Moreover, the experiments of lignin dioxasolv
evidenced that 70% of β-O-4 linkages, approximately, have disappeared while β-5, β–β, α-O-γ,
and γ-O-α linkages remain. Therefore, it is a selective method for the fragmentation of β-O-4
bonds. Finally, for the Redox Flow system, monomer yields are 80% and 76% for vanillic and

syringic acid, respectively (3.3 and 3.9% w/w) for beech lignin and 74% to produce vanillic acid
(6.0% w/w) for lignin pine, rivaling in both with state-of-the-art but operating at room
temperature. Consequently, we can conclude the Ni-Co-Fe composition of the electrocatalyst
has been successfully optimized to develop a method capable of selectively cleaving β-O-4
linkages and obtaining high monomeric yields working at room temperature without the use of
noble metals and improving the results of Ni electrocatalysts.
