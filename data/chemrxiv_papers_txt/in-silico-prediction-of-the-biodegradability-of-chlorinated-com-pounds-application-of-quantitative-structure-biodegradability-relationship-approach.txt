ABSTRACT: Chlorinated compounds are generally known to be non-readily biodegradable. The insight into the structural
features that allow chlorinated compounds to readily biodegrade is crucial information that needs to be unveiled. Combined
in silico modeling and machine learning approach to predict desirable compound properties has proven to be an effective
tool, enabling chemists to save time and resources compared to web lab experimentation. Here we present two machine
learning-based quantitative structure – biodegradability relationship (QSBR) models, one for predicting biodegradability values of chlorinated compounds, and the other one for classifying chlorinated compounds as biodegradable or non-biodegradable. The regression models were generated using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning method. The optimal
regression model was a 10 descriptor SVR model with R2 = 0.925 and R2test = 0.881. The optimal classification model was a
logistic regression classifier model with 5 descriptors. It has a Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient of 0.59 for training and 0.55
for test, as well as accuracy of 0.79 for training set, 0.77 for test set. For validation purposes the models were tested on an
external data set of chlorinated compounds. In addition, models were further applied to an external test set of monomeric
units representing polymers to assess the capability of the model to estimate the biodegradability of polymers, where the
models showed statistical robustness. The developed SVR model could be used for accurate prediction of biodegradability of
various organic molecules, as well as materials based on organic compounds. The analysis of the influence of descriptors on
biodegradability is performed. The classification model showed that the biodegradability of chlorinated compounds is heavily
correlated with descriptors that relate to electrotopological descriptors, position of oxygen relative to chlorine.

Introduction
Polymer plastic materials have profoundly shaped the
course of the last century, revolutionizing industries and
daily life alike. Their lightweight, versatile, and cost-effective nature paved the way for innovations in packaging,
manufacturing, and medical devices, fostering economic
growth and enhancing human well-being. Plastics assumed
a significant role in the global economy with their increased
usage. However, as the utilization of plastic escalated, apprehensions regarding the environmental repercussions of
post-use plastics arose. Rapid plastic accumulation has
shown devastating effects in marine and land environments.1,2,3. The environmental impact of traditional petrochemical-based polymers has caused concern over the depletion of nonrenewable resources and waste management.4,5,6. In addition to concerns for the carbon footprint
and bulk management of these materials, microplastic pollution is a major challenge that could have lasting environmental and human health impacts. 7,8,9,10 Polymer plastics

can pose a severe threat to the environment, biodiversity,
and human health due to possible buildup where natural
functions are inhibited, especially as they degrade into microplastics.1,3
Questions regarding approaches of plastic management led
the scientific community to research techniques to better
re-utilize or to safely degrade plastics.11 Such techniques include mechanical degradation, thermo-chemical degradation, photodegradation, and biodegradation.11,12 The complexity of logistics and the expenses associated with mechanical, thermo-chemical, and photodegradation reprocessing have made biodegradation the preferred solution
for addressing plastic waste challenges on a large
scale.13,14,15 Biodegradability is the ability of a material to
break down into simpler compounds by the action of microorganisms, and the term is generally used as a measure of
the rate at which a material will break down. Ultimately, any
organic compound is biodegradable, going through processes of deterioration, fragmentation, assimilation, and

mineralization; however, this process may take hundreds of
years for certain materials.16
The investigation and data analysis of biodegradability of
materials is delineated by the various engineering standards applied for determining biodegradability, which include ISO, CEN, and ASTM standards.17, 18,19,20,21,22,23,24.
Moreover, these standards do not take into account the environmental impact of the material at end-of-life. While
some overlap exists between standards, specific implementation of variables such as time frames and percentages degraded differ. Furthermore, no single standard can simulate
the process of biodegradation within a natural environment
fully. Despite these challenges, investigation into the engineering of enzymes, bacteria, fungi, or algae capable of plastic degradation has yielded promising outcomes for certain
extensively-utilized plastic types in recent years. However,
owing to the extensive diversity of plastics, the hereto developed microorganism solutions exhibit the capability to
degrade only specific plastic varieties.15
Clearly, given the engineering and environmental challenges polymer plastics, the development of new polymers
must focus on the creation of safely biodegradable or completely compostable materials. Emerging materials, such as
Polycaprolactone-collagen hydrolysate blends, have been
engineered to be compostable by design.25 To increase the
pace of materials development, it is essential to create a
framework of principles for polymer biodegradation to aid
in the research of plastic-degrading organisms and to develop more biodegradable materials. Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR) is a pivotal concept and
a technique in materials design which encompasses computational models that correlate the structural characteristics
of materials with their specific properties, enabling informed predictions and tailoring of materials for desired
functionalities.26 Furthermore, an extension of this concept,
Quantitative Structure-Biodegradability Relationships
(QSBR), applies the QSPR framework specifically to the prediction of material biodegradation behaviors. These QSBR
models establish connections between molecular structures and biodegradability, offering valuable insights for the
design of environmentally sustainable materials with enhanced degradation properties.27,28
Multiple QSBR models have been developed for biodegradation, providing insight into the impact of chemical structure
on the complex biodegradation process.29,30,31 Certain models exhibit strong predictive capabilities for biodegradation
yet lack conceptual clarity, whereas others demonstrate a
partial accuracy in predicting biodegradability while emphasizing structure-property relationships. The central
hurdle in biodegradability prediction centers around the intricate task of formulating precise models for polymers.
Constructing such models for discrete chemicals is feasible;
however, the complexity arises when dealing with polymers
due to the absence of uniform biodegradation testing and
data reporting standards, the lack of standardized characterization methods, and the extensive diversity and intricacy inherent to polymers. It is important to note that presence of above-mentioned structures does not guarantee the
biodegradability or non-biodegradability of compounds but
is highly correlated and can be used as a tool for predictability with either class.

Chlorinated polymers represent a distinctive class of materials characterized by the incorporation of chlorine into
their polymer chains, introducing unique properties to the
resulting polymers, such as improved flame resistance,
thermal stability, chemical resistance, and electrical insulation. As a subset of halogenated polymers, chlorinated polymers find applications in various industries, including construction, electronics, automotive, and aerospace, where
their exceptional fire-retardant properties are particularly
advantageous. However, concerns have been raised about
the environmental impact of chlorinated polymers due to
the potential release of toxic halogenated compounds during their production, use, and disposal. As presented by
Vorberg et. al., the tendency of halogens in organic compounds making them extremely non-biodegradable, especially the tendency of chlorinated compounds which are estimated to be 15 times more likely to be non-biodegradable
than biodegradable seems to be of great interest.29 Additionally, most chloride substituents are acutely toxic, and
could provide a long-term toxicity effect on the environment.32
There is an ongoing effort to develop more sustainable alternatives to traditional chlorinated polymers while retaining their desirable attributes. Despite the overall trend of
toxicity among the by-products of chlorinated compound
biodegradation, exceptions exist, and these exceptions warrant a closer examination to discern underlying factors governing the biodegradation process. In this context, QSBR
emerges as a valuable tool, offering the potential to decipher the intricate relationships between molecular structures and biodegradability outcomes. This research endeavors to construct focused models specifically tailored to chlorinated polymer compounds. The objective is to establish a
heightened level of precision in predicting the biodegradability of chlorinated materials. By concentrating on this narrower range of chemical compounds, the study seeks to enhance the reliability and applicability of the QSBR model,
thereby offering a targeted tool for advancing the understanding of chlorinated compound degradation and guiding
the design of environmentally sustainable materials within
this distinct chemical context.
2. Materials and Methods
The data for the experiment consisted of two data sets of
chlorinated compounds, continuous (I) and binary (II).33,31
Data Set I Collection and Modeling
Biodegradability information for chlorinated compounds in
the continuous data set (I) was obtained from Toropov et
al.33 Where dataset unit is originally measured as oxygen
consumption following Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) 301C – MITI Biodegradation Test.34,35 The data set contained 74 compounds, with a
continuous value for biodegradability, ranging from 0 to 1.
For validation purposes, the data set was split into training
and testing sets, where the training set was used to train
models and the test set was used for model validation.
To generate a set of descriptors, 2D molecular structures in
MOL format were generated using ChemSketch.36 The 2D
structures were used to obtain SMILES notation by applying
OpenBabel software.37 To obtain a set of molecular

descriptors, the Online Chemical Modeling Environment
(OCHEM.EU) was used.38 The molecules were standardized
using the CDK standardizer. After standardization, molecules were neutralized, salts were removed, and structures
were cleaned. The OEState Bonds 2D Indices descriptors,
ALogPS 2D descriptors, and all subcategories of alvaDesc
v.2.0.14 3D descriptors excluding Drug-like indices were
calculated. The compounds were optimized with OpenBabel
using the Merck Molecular Force Field.39–41 In total 5856 descriptors were calculated. Highly correlated descriptors
(R>0.9), constant and near constant descriptors (std<0.1)
were removed from the data set. Descriptors having less
than 10 compounds containing non-zero entries were removed due to inability for descriptor to effectively describe
the response value. After eliminating highly correlated descriptors, constant, near constant descriptors, and descriptors with low presence, 925 descriptors were present
in the data set. All data curation steps were performed using
Python (version 3.10.9).42,43
The data set was normalized by the standard scale normalization using Scikit-learn package, which normalizes the
data through their mean and standard of deviation using the

predicted values, respectively. Then criteria chosen for assessing QSBR model were chosen in accordance with OECD
principal No.4 for developing QSBR models with “appropriate measures of goodness of fit, robustness, and predictivity).
The best model was selected based on the best values for
the above criteria for both training and testing sets to avoid
overfitting. The 𝑅2 and 𝑅2 test of the best models from each
number of variables were comparted to indicate possible
over fitting at specific variable number. This allows for ease
of understanding the statistically best number of variables
for indicating performance of models in both training and
test analysis.
To prepare the data for construction and evaluation of QSBR
models, the data was sorted based on the biodegradability
values from smallest to largest and split into training and
test sets in 4:1 ration, with every 5th compound going into
the test set. The model was developed based on the training
set through Genetic Algorithm (GA) for variable selection.
The variable selection process started with a population of
1000 random models and 10000 iterations for evolution,
with the mutation probability being 50%.
To further refine the descriptor selection of GA, an iterative
𝑋𝑖𝑗 − 𝑋𝑗

Figure 1. QSBR SVR Model Development Methodology

Data Set II Collection and Modeling
Biodegradability information for chlorinated compounds in
the binary data set (II) was obtained from the work of
Mansouri et al.31 The data set contained 236 chlorinated
compounds, with values being either 0 or 1 and representing the non-biodegradable or readily biodegradable compounds respectively. Similarly, to the continuous dataset,
the oxygen consumption was measured following OECD301C protocol.35 In Mansouri et al.’s work, compounds with
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at or above 60% are
classified as readily biodegradable. Any compounds below
60% are classified as non-readily biodegradable.46 For validation purposes, the data set was split into training and
testing sets, where the training set was used to train models
and the test set was used for model validation.
To generate a set of descriptors, 2D molecular structures in
MOL format were generated using ChemSketch.36 The 2D
structures were used to obtain SMILES notation by applying
OpenBabel software.37 To obtain a set of molecular descriptors, the OCHEM.eu was used.38 The molecules were
standardized using the CDK standardizer. After standardization, molecules were neutralized, salts were removed,

descriptors, ALogPS 2D descriptors, and all subcategories of
alvaDesc v.2.0.14 3D descriptors excluding Drug-like indices were calculated. The compounds were optimized with
OpenBabel. In total 5856 descriptors were calculated.
Highly correlated descriptors (R>0.9), constant and near
constant descriptors (std<0.1) were removed from the data
set. Descriptors with less than 10 compounds of them having non-zero entries were removed as well. After eliminating highly correlated descriptors, constant and near constant descriptors, and descriptors with low presence, 992
descriptors were present in the data set. All data curation
steps were performed using Python (version 3.10.9).42 The
large difference in range among descriptors makes descriptors with smaller range outweighed by descriptors
with larger range. 43
The data set was normalized by the standard scale normalization using Scikit-learn package.44 which normalizes the

data through their mean and standard of deviation using the
(Equation (1)).
The developed QSBR model was subjected to statistical
analysis evaluating confusion matrix by means of calculating Precision, Recall, F-Score (F1), Accuracy, Specificity, and
Mathhew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The following
equations were used to calculate Precision (Equation (5)),

The best model was selected based on the best values for
the above criteria for both training and testing sets to avoid

Figure 2. QSBR Logistic Regression Classification Model Development Methodology
To prepare the data for construction and evaluation of QSBR
models, the data was oversampled to prevent model from
being biased towards the majority class (non-biodegradable), sorted based on the biodegradability values from
smallest to largest and split into training and test sets in 4:1
ration, with every 5th compound going into the test set. The
oversampling was performed using the Scikit-learn python
package.44 Utilizing ‘minority’ strategy for random state in a
range from 0 to 99, with 10 types of classifiers performing
5 feature Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) for each random state of oversampling. The MCC was set as the scoring
metrics for the selection. Ten classifiers were applied to the
dataset to determine best classifier for dataset. Rationality
of choosing best classifier was conducted based on a combined highest average performing model, out of 100, with
ease of descriptor explanation. The ten classifiers Logisic
Regression, K-Neighbors, SVC, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision
Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boost, Quadratic, and MLP. The
optimal results were found with Logistic Regression classifier with assuming 5 features for all classifiers. Data of this
methodology is shown in supporting information.
All parameters for oversampling, SFS, and classifiers were
set to default which could be found in the Scikit-learn library documentation.44 The feature selection process for
the optimal number of features at the set oversampling
state utilized the SFS method with Logistic Regression being
set as the classifier and MCC being set as the scoring metrics.
All other parameters were set to default and could be found
in the Scikit-learn library documentation. 44 The process development method is shown in Figure 2.
3. Results and Discussion
Continuous Data – SVR Model
After initial data processing the continuous data set contained 925 descriptors. Those descriptors were used to develop multiple QSBR models. The QSBR model with the best
statistical characteristics was selected for further analysis.
The selected model’s statistical performance is listed in Table 1, (Model 3). In Table 1 the quality of models was assessed based on the correlation coefficient for training set,
leave-one-out coefficient, and external validation coefficient, as well as mean absolute error MAE. The values for

robustness of the model for the training set were higher
than for the test set, and the values of the errors for the
training set were lower than for the test set, indicating consistency.

For visualization of performance, Figure 3 shows the correlation plot if training and test sets. Where the experimental
data and predicted values are compared.
It can be seen in Table 1. that the performance of the model
is quite accurate and robust of chlorine containing compounds. R2training is above 0.90 showing high levels of predictability and R2test is 0.88 shows its predictive capabilities.
The relatively low values of MAE (~0.06) show the model’s
performance error is low.
It is necessary to mention how this data was heavily influenced by a large amount of data with a response value at or
near 0. This emphasizes the performance of the model with
having a skewed dataset.
The predicted values and the experimental values, shown in
Figure 3, for biodegradability are relatively close to the diagonal line, which confirms the high performance of the

model As mentioned previously the dataset contains many
values near 0 where it skews the dataset which is known to
poorly influence the model performance. The Figure shows
a large amount of these near 0 values, to be predicted relatively well.

Figure 3. Experimental vs Predicted Biodegradability Values Obtained by the SVR Model
The Williams plot of the model for continuous data is shown
in Figure 4. The applicability domain ranges from Std. Residual of –3 to +3 along y axis and 0.0 to h(i/i) of the leverage data along the x-axis.

Figure 4. William’s Plot – SVR model of Continuous Data
Regarding Figure 4, the Williams Plot, all the points of the
model fall within three standardized residuals, indicating
proximity of predicted and experimental values. The leverages of all molecules are within the threshold, except for one
compound in the training set, indicating it being a structural
outlier but still able to be predicted. With this information it
is shown that most of our dataset falls within the applicability domain.
With model development we can assume some level of influential information being derived from the selected descriptors. Due to the nature of SVR model development we
can assume a non-linear correlation between descriptors
and biodegradability. With this in mind, the descriptors
chosen by GA are shown in Table 2, and then analysis of
normalized descriptors’ values by ALE plots are shown in
Figures 5 and 6. The process we employ to understand the
descriptors and their influence is a knowledge-based analysis.
Due to the complexity of the descriptors and their influences, we take a two-step approach to help discuss their influence. The first step is by grouping them in similar structural informational groups based on their structural influence. The second step is by analyzing them individually by
discussing the trends found in the ALE plots.
Groupings are meant to simplify the analysis process by
conceptualizing their general information. In the first group
we categorize it according to its overall mass and shape of
the compounds. The second grouping of descriptors is more
focused on atomic volume, distance, and presence of functional groups within the structures. The third group emphasizes the electrotopological information of the structures
where electron availability combined with general topology
has influence on biodegradation.
Based on the training set ALE plots above, it is shown that
all descriptors in the model have a complicated relationship
with the response value of biodegradability. Training set
ALE plots are analyzed since that was the dataset that
trained the model. It was necessary to compare training vs
test set ALE plots to highlight their similarity emphasizing
the test set representing, with some differences, the training
set with little significant outliers.
The interpretation of ALE plots could be described as follows, the x-axis signifies the descriptor value, and the slope
of the tangent line at that x-value signifies the impact on biodegradability.45 All x-values listed on the graph are normalized using standard scaler.

Figure 5. ALE Plots for SVR Model of Continuous Data, Training Set
Descriptors referring to mass and shape information
As seen in Figure 5a negative values of P2m negatively impact biodegradation and positive values of P2m barely impact biodegradation, signifying that high shape uniformness
of a molecule with respect to mass doesn’t impact biodegradability significantly, and that high heterogeneousness of
molecule’s shape with respect to mass impacts biodegradability negatively.
Shown in Figure 5c, the slope of GATS4m is positive for values lower than 1, signifying that high shape uniformness of
a molecule with respect to mass affects biodegradability
positively. There is only one data point in the ALE plot for
GATS4m with value greater than 1, therefore it could not be
concluded based of this descriptor whether heterogeneousness of shape with respect to mass would affect the biodegradability positively or negatively.
Descriptors referring to atomic volume, distance, and
presence of functional groups
The slope of F05[C-Cl], shown in Figure 5b, is mostly positive, signifying that the more C-Cl bonds at topological distance of 5 the molecule has, the higher is the rate of biodegradability. This information is generally against what other
works have suggested where Cl containing molecules have

generally lower levels of biodegradability. This is a contentious finding but since our work focuses solely on this bond
arrangement of Cl containing compounds, there can be further investigation into this influence.
The general trend of Eta_F_A, shown in Figure 5d, from –4
to ~ 2, indicates that for larger molecules the rate of biodegradability goes down.
The slope of VE1_G/D, shown in Figure 5f, is positive or
somewhat positive for all values of the descriptors, being
most positive between the values of –1 and 0, and most neutral between the values of 0 and 1. This signifies that
VE1_G/D aids biodegradability the most for values between
–1 and 0, and aids biodegradability the least between the
values of 0 and 1. It also shows that there is a relationship
between topological distances within the molecule.
The slope of RDF030v, shown in Figure 5j, is negative for
values less than 1 and positive for values larger than one.
Though there are 2 values larger than one, this trend is signifying that van der Waals volume is positively correlated
with the rate of biodegradation, and low van der Waals volume affects biodegradability negatively.

Figure 6. ALE Plots for SVR Model of Continuous Data, Test Set
This is an interesting finding where all compounds within
our dataset contain H,C,Cl, and sometimes N or O. The highest two volume atoms being C and Cl, it is believed that comparing this descriptor and F05[C-Cl] suggest a synergistic
effect between the two. At the very least we believe they are
pointing to some unforeseen insight into the connection between C and Cl arrangement along molecules which positively influence the biodegradability
Figure 5e, shows the slope of GATS4p as negative for all values. Signifying that high uniformness of a molecule with respect to polarizability negatively affects biodegradability.
There is only one data point in the ALE plot for GATS4p with
value greater than 1, therefore it could not be concluded
based of this descriptor whether heterogeneousness of polarizability would affect the biodegradability positively or
negatively.
Autocorrelation descriptors compare neighboring sections
of molecules to one another, that in combination of the uniformness found with polarizability. We believe that a repetitive molecule, such as a uniform carbon chain may be negatively influential to biodegradability. Though simplifying
the material, an example with long aliphatic chains are

polymer materials. Where carbon backbone polymers are
developed and are to have generally low levels of biodegradability.
Descriptors referring to electrotopological information
The slope of Eig05_AEA(dm), shown in Figure 5g, is negative for values less than 0 and neutral for values greater
than 0, signifying that Eig05_AEA(dm) is negatively correlated with biodegradability for values less than 0, and does
not seem to impact biodegradability for values greater than
0. It also shows that there is a complex relationship between
the overall dipole moment of a molecule and biodegradability. More insight is needed to fully describe this descriptor's
influence.
Both descriptors including dipole moment have an overall
negative trend, if looking at minimal descriptor value to
maximum descriptor value along the ALE plot of
Eig05_AEA(dm) and SpMaxA_EA(dm) . The dipole moment
is known to be the separation of charges throughout a polar
molecule. The general negative trend in both Eig05_AEA
suggests low levels of dipole moment being a positive trend
in biodegradability. Though initial thoughts are increased
level of dipole moment would allow for more interactions

to occur between microbial enzymes and molecules, this
negative trend may suggest possible toxicity influence of the
compounds during biodegradation process. Where reactive
compounds can decay the microorganism's degradation capabilities.
The ALE plot of Figure 5h, shows that the slope of
VE1sign_Dz(p) is positive for values less than 0.5 and negative for values greater than 0.5. Signifying that
VE1sign_Dz(p) is negatively correlated with biodegradability for values less than 0.5, and positively correlated with
biodegradability for values greater than 0.5. It also shows
that there is a relationship between the overall polarizability of a molecule and biodegradability.
Generally polarizability increases as the volume occupied
by electrons increases.48 This is generally thought of as
larger atoms have more loosely held electrons in comparison to smaller atoms.49 The electrotopological information
this provides is assumed to combine atomic size, similar to
Rdf030V descriptor where volume is an influential manner.
The available electrons for dipole moment to occur shows
synergy with the Eig05_AEA(dm), SpMaxA_EA(dm), and
GATS4p descriptors.
The slope of SpMaxA_EA(dm), as shown in Figure 5i, is positive for values less than roughly 1.5 and negative for values
greater than that point, which signifies that if value is less
than 1.5, SpMaxA_EA(dm) influences biodegradability positively, and if value is greater than that of 1.5 it impacts biodegradability negatively. It also shows there is a relationship between biodegradation and alcohols (which was confirmed by past studies to be positive) and biodegradation
and dipole moment (which is a trend that could be studied
further).
The incorporation of dipole moment in this descriptor
aligns with what was previously mentioned in with the
Eig05_AEA(dm) descriptor. Additionally, the inclusion of

edge adjacency information in both descriptors gives insight into the bond-atom ratio within a molecule towards
biodegradability. Though more investigation is needed to
understand the bond-atom ratio influence, it highlights influential connections between structure and biodegradability.
A quick summary of the SVR model of the continuous data
is as follows. High frequency of carbon and chlorine atoms
at topological distance 5, high uniformness of molecule with
respect to mass, and high van der Waals volume are positively correlated with biodegradability. High heterogeneousness of molecule’s shape with respect to mass, large size
of a molecule, and high uniformness of a molecule with respect to polarizability are negatively correlated with biodegradability. All electrotopological group descriptors have
an overall negative relationship to the biodegradability of
molecules. Topological distances between various atoms,
overall dipole moment of a molecule, overall polarizability
of a molecule, and the relationship between alcohols in a
molecule and its dipole moment need to be investigated further to determine their relationship to biodegradability.
Binary Data
After initial data processing the classification data set contained 992 descriptors. SFS was used to determine the best
performing descriptors. The chosen descriptors were used
to develop a logistic regression classification QSBR model.
The models were monitored to avoid over-fitting and the
highest statistical performing model was chosen for further
analysis. To monitor model performance, relative to descriptor number and avoid overfitting, the performance of
models relative to number of descriptors is shown in Figure
7 for both training and test set.

Once the best performing number of descriptors was determined, the quality of models was assessed based on MCC.
Additionally, we take into consideration accuracy, precision, recall, f1, and specificity. The overall performance of
the model shows moderate to high level of predictability
while also allowing for interpretability of descriptors. As logistic regression is readily interpretable.43 The developed
logistic regression model is shown in Equation 11.
Model performance is shown in Figure 8 where the MCC
shows the values of true positive, true negative, false

positive, and false negative. Generally, the ratio of correctly
predicted true values relative to incorrectly predicted false
values, give insight into the performance of our model. The
statistical performance of the model is shown in Table 4
where the model performs well. High levels of performance
for precision, accuracy, and specificity suggest great predictability and classification.

Figure 9. The Area Under the Curve of a, Training and b, Test Sets for Logistic Regression Model.

To view the robustness of the model, area under the curve
(AUC) plots were generated and shown in Figure 9. The
area under the blue curve shows the ability of the model to
predict compounds within the applicability domain. If the
blue line is aligned with the orange line this indicates random classification (0.5), where the orange line is superimposed onto the figure for comparison purposes.
Classification Model
Discussing Figure 7, the plot was made to monitor possible
over fitting and determine best number of descriptors
based on statistical performance. It can be seen that the
model’s performance, relative to number of descriptors,
stagnates or reduces after the 5-descriptor mark. The best
performing model with fewest number of descriptors was
chosen.
Before analyzing the descriptors, we can discuss the statistical performance of the logistic regression model. Figure 8
shows how the model disproportionally predicts false positives relative to the amount of positives (readily biodegradable) within the dataset. This indicates that the model’s
capability is tailored more towards predicting non-biodegradable compounds. This can occur due to influence of the
low amount readily biodegradable compounds vs non readily biodegradable distribution of the dataset. The dataset is
heavily weighted by non-readily biodegradable compounds. Though this occurs, influential information can still
be found regarding both readily biodegradable and nonreadily biodegradable compounds.
The ability of the model to distinguish between the two classes of readily biodegradable and non-readily biodegradable
is represented as AUC plot in Figure 9. The closer the value
to one, the better discriminatory power of the binary classification model. An AUC value of 0.79 indicates that the

model has reasonably good ability to distinguish between
the biodegradable and non-biodegradable compounds. This
highlights the ability of our model to distinguish between
the two categories even with the dataset heavily favored towards non-readily biodegradable.
The descriptors and their influential information selected
by SFS is described using knowledge-based analysis. We
grouped the descriptors into 2 categories based on their
definition and influence of defined chemical properties. The
categories being electrotopological and presence of functional groups.
Descriptors referring to electrotopological information
MATS1s, the Moran autocorrelation of lag 1 weighted by Istate, describes Moran coefficient of a molecular graph with
respect to its intrinsic states at topological distance of
1.50,51,52 The low value of the descriptor indicates random
dispersion of free valence electrons, while a high value indicates valence electrons being clustered in one area of a compound.
H2s, the H autocorrelation of lag 2 / weighted by I-state, describes the average leverage of each atom in relation to
other atoms at a topological distance 2, with respect to intrinsic state, where higher leverage indicates smaller or linear molecules and lower leverage indicates larger or spherical molecules. The value also increases from linear to more
branched molecules.53
Se1C1C2s, the E-state index, describes a sum of intrinsic
states based on the ratio of Kier-Hall electronegativity to the
number of skeletal single bonds of molecule’s Carbon 1 and
Carbon 2 atoms with available sigma bonds. The intrinsic
state value is larger for electronegative atoms or atoms with
few skeletal connections and is smaller for atoms with several available sigma bonds.54

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-p7dx4 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7845-4884 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Descriptors of MATS1s, H2s, and Se1C1C2s all relate to the
intrinsic state of the molecules and include some level of
topological information. Intrinsic state signifies the amount
of weak bonded electrons relative to strongly bonded electrons. It suggests that the electrons distributed along the
molecule has influence on the biodegradability. Though it is
difficult to ascertain what level of influence electronic information has on biodegradability due to the varying magnitude and sign of the coefficients, we can assume large influence by these factors. Further information on the topology
includes the size, shape, and bond types thus combining
with electronic information gives us a possible direction for
future investigations.
SM06_AEA(dm), the spectral moment of order 6 from augmented edge adjacency matrix weighted by dipole moment,
describes a complex non-linear relationship between various atoms of a compound, and in simple terms could be conceptualized as the average amount of bonds that an atom
shares with other atoms written in a matrix that is brought
to a power of its order (in this case 6), indicating embedding
frequencies, with respect to dipole moment. The low value
of SM06_AEA could indicate low branching of a molecule to
dipole moment ratio, and high values could indicate high
branching to dipole moment ratio.52
Descriptors referring to presence of functional groups
The descriptor, B03[O-Cl], describes the frequency of chlorine atoms being at a topological distance of 3 in relation to
oxygen atoms. Due to the obvious connection of the descriptor and its connection to the topology of the structure
allows for ease of understanding, with the chlorine atom being relatively close.
Model
As seen in the model Equation 11, the probability of biodegradation is negatively impacted by MATS1s, signifying
that dispersed intrinsic states of a molecule aid biodegradation and clustered intrinsic states impact it negatively.
The negative impact on biodegradation by SM06_AEA(dm)
indicates that low branching of a molecule to dipole moment ratio aids biodegradation, while high value becomes
an obstacle to the process.
The negative impact on biodegradation by H2s indicates
that molecules with low average leverage of atoms are more
likely to be biodegradable, and molecules with high leverage are less likely. It also indicates that spherical molecules
are more likely to be biodegradable than linear molecules,
and linear molecules are more likely to be biodegradable
than branched molecules.
The negative impact on biodegradation by B03[O-Cl] indicates that presence of oxygen atoms at a topological distance 3 away from chlorine atoms makes the compound less
likely to be biodegradable.
The positive impact on biodegradation by Se1C1C2s indicates that compounds with C1 and C2 carbons having fewer
skeletal connections are more likely to be biodegradable.
The presence of few sigma bonds for those atoms would
lower the chance of biodegradability.

Chlorinated compounds are generally known to be difficult
to degrade due to their toxic products formed when in natural environments. Because of this, we were interested in
determining compounds that contain chlorine but are
known to be readily biodegradable due to their scarcity and
possible use. Two models were developed with the goal of
predicting the biodegradability of chlorine containing compounds. One model, being a 10 variable SVR model based on
continuous data, was developed using Scikit-learn package.
Analysis of the predictive capability and influential explanation of the descriptors was conducted. The statistical performance of R2Training and R2Test are 0.925 and 0.881 respectively. It was found that mass, shape, topology, functionality,
and electrotopological information of the compounds have
influential characteristics relative to the distribution of the
descript on biodegradability. Synergistic effects are believed to be expressed through commonalities of the descriptors where RDF030v and F05[C-Cl] indicate atomic
volume connecting to C – CL bond arrangement in the topology of the compounds.
The second model, being logistic regression model based on
categorical data of readily biodegradable vs. Non readily biodegradable, was developed and analyzed. The MCC was
used as the primary indicator of model performance with an
precision and accuracy of 0.78 and 0.79 respectively. The
model showed higher levels of false positives which we attribute to the skewed dataset containing many more nonreadily biodegradable compounds vs readily biodegradable.
The descriptors were further analyzed and suggest that
electrotopological information, specifical intrinsic state,
and topological information have influence on biodegradability. Though it is difficult to determine the direction of influence of the electrotopological information, such as positive or negative towards biodegradability, we can see how
available electrons for interatomic interactions shows varying levels of biodegradability. This may be signifying the
need for electrons to be easily moved throughout the molecule for degradation to occur while also signifying possible
toxic products being formed due to changes in electrotopological structure. The topological descriptor of BO3[C-Cl]
suggests C to Cl connections 3 atoms apart negatively affect
biodegradation. We believe it describes aliphatic chains
nearby Cl atoms, such as found in polymeric materials, deter
biodegradation to occur.
Both models give insight into the structural features of biodegradability of chlorine containing compounds where further investigation in the complex nature of electronic and
topological information are intertwined in biodegradability.
We believe future work in investigating described variations in the electronic structural and topological systems,
such as applying ab initio methods, would give needed insight into the complex relationship between structure and
biodegradability of chlorine containing compounds.
