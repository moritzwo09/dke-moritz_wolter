ABSTRACT: The surface of Titan, Saturn’s icy moon, is believed to be comprised of various molecular minerals with a great
diversity in structure and composition. Under the surface conditions, 93 K and 1.45 atm, most small molecules solidify and form
minerals, including acetylene and ammonia. These two compounds can form single-component solids but also a 1:1 binary cocrystal
that exhibits intriguing rotor phase behavior. This cocrystal is a putative mineral on Titan and other planetary bodies such as comets.
In addition, the structure of the cocrystal is relevant to fundamental science as it can help better understand the emergence of rotor
phases. Here we present a detailed vibrational neutron spectroscopic study supported by neutron powder diffraction study on the
cocrystal and the single-phase solids. The experimentally observed spectral bands were assigned based on theoretical calculations.
The established spectra–properties correlations for the cocrystal corroborate the observed properties. To the best of our knowledge,
this study presents the first example of the application of neutron vibrational spectroscopy in studying Titan-relevant organic minerals.

hydrocarbon lakes, with modest to poor solubility.7 Similar to
the hydrological cycle on Earth, Titan has a seasonal cycling of
evaporation and precipitation of the hydrocarbon lakes, producing evaporite lakebeds and deposits of organic minerals akin to
evaporate deposits on Earth.7 This combination of chemical and
physical processes leads to the formation of solid surfaces with
extraordinary complexity in composition and structure. In light
of the forthcoming Dragonfly mission, as well as to further our
fundamental knowledge of the physical chemistry of the smallest organic molecules, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of these systems.
Acetylene and ammonia are some of the smallest and most fundamental organic molecules in the universe and are found in
relatively large quantities on Titan. In fact, acetylene is one of
the most abundant organic products generated in Titan’s atmosphere.8 Its presence was detected in the upper atmosphere by
Voyager 1, and later confirmed during the Cassini-Huygens
mission by its numerous instruments, including Cassini composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS),8 ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS),9 and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer
(GCMS).10 Acetylene has a relatively high solubility in liquid
alkanes and is also known to form cocrystals with numerous
organic co-components.11 Ammonia and ammonium were also
detected in the upper atmosphere of Titan by the Cassini INMS
instrument. Further studies indicate that Titan’s mantle may be

INTRODUCTION
In 2019, NASA announced the New Frontiers Mission to
Saturn's icy moon, Titan. A rotorcraft named Dragonfly is
scheduled for launch in 2027, with arrival on the moon expected
in the 2030s.1 This endeavor closely follows the Cassini-Huygens mission (1997-2017), which was vital in exploring Saturn
and its moons.2 It is no surprise that Titan remains a focal point
of scientific interest, as it is the only planetary body in the Solar
System, apart from Earth, to possess a dense and chemically
active atmosphere that is rich with organic compounds derived
from methane and nitrogen.3 On Titan, these compounds can
react in the upper atmosphere primarily via photochemical reactions induced by solar radiation and charged particles originating from Saturn’s magnetosphere.4 This ionizing radiation
causes methane and nitrogen to dissociate and form reactive
species that interact to form organic molecules ranging from
very simple (ethane, propane, acetylene, etc.) to very complex
molecules (>10,000 Da) that precipitate onto Titan’s surface.
Chemical reactions can continue even on the surface,5 further
contributing to the remarkable compositional diversity of this
environment. Under Titan’s surface conditions (»90 K–94 K
and »1.5 bar), methane is close to its triple point, and ethane
(and propane) exists as a liquid comprising the vast lakes and
seas.6 All larger organics are expected to exist as solids under
these conditions. These chemicals also dissolve in the

comprised of as much as 1.6 mass percent to 10.7 mass percent
NH3 resulting from Titan’s extensive subsurface NH3-H2O
ocean.12 Ammonia or ammonium on Titan’s surface would
likely originate from the advection of melt pockets, transport by
microporous clathrate grains, explosive cryovolcano eruptions,
or local geysering from NH3-rich deposits in the crust.12-15 The
coexistence of these two materials, coupled with their ability to
interact and form cocrystals is suggestive of the possibility that
acetylene:ammonia cocrystals are abundant organic minerals on
the landscape of Titan. Furthermore, these binary solids are also
relevant in the studies of other planetary bodies. For example,
both materials have been detected as constituents of the comets,
such as Hyakutake.16 Both molecules are also believed to be
present in prebiotic Earth.17-19 The intermolecular interactions
within condensed phases of such simple organic systems can be
relevant for the studies of planetary bodies and as well as modeling of processes occurring on young prebiotic Earth. Such interactions are indeed strong between ammonia and acetylene,2122
resulting in a stable 1:1 cocrystal that was reported in 2009.23
In the last ten years, there have been various studies focused on
this cocrystal under Titan’s conditions, particularly using infrared (IR) and Raman vibrational spectroscopic studies.24, 25 The
synthesis and formation of the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal has been extensively studied by in-situ Raman spectroscopy,
and vibrational modes corresponding to lattice vibrations and
the C-H bends of acetylene have been frequently used as diagnostic signals for cocrystal formation.21-24 These signals had relatively large blue shifts in the cocrystal of 5.24 meV (42.3 cm1
) and 8.16 meV (65.8 cm-1) respectively, when compared to the
single component spectra. These large shifts in the Raman spectra were particularly useful as a probe for the presence of this
cocrystal and this was used as a marker for both the formation
and degradation of the material under liquid methane and
ethane. Infrared spectroscopy has also been used to characterize
the cocrystal in core-shelled aerosolized particles.25 We aimed
to expand our understanding of the vibrational fingerprint of
this cocrystal through the use of NVS as the concluding piece
of its spectroscopic characterization.
IR and Raman spectroscopy have specific symmetry-dependent
selection rules for vibrational modes – certain modes are only
IR active, whereas others are Raman active. On the contrary,
neutron vibrational spectroscopy (NVS) is a far more comprehensive tool for studying the vibrational structure of materials,
as it detects all vibrational modes, regardless of symmetry. Furthermore, neutrons interact with the strong nuclear force of the
atomic nucleus, as opposed to the electron cloud probed by photons in optical measurements. The particle-particle interactions
are particularly strong with H/D atoms. Considering the hydrogen-rich environment on Titan, NVS presents an excellent tool
for the exploration of hydrogen-rich putative Titanean minerals
and condensed phases relevant to young prebiotic Earth. Finally, NVS can typically access vibrational frequencies in the
phonon range (5 meV-25 meV; 40 cm-1 - 200 cm-1) with much
higher resolution than other vibrational methods. This spectral
region contains valuable information on the lattice vibrations
and structure of the material.
To the best of our knowledge, NVS has not been applied in the
study of Titan-relevant organic minerals, and there are scarce
reports on the application of the method in planetary research.2025
Here we report a detailed NVS study of the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal. To prove that the spectroscopic data have

been collected from the target material, we have simultaneously
collected and analyzed Time-of-Flight Neutron Powder Diffraction (TOF-NPD) data. Finally, we have complemented the
experimental studies with theoretical calculations, which allowed for detailed spectral assignments and structure–properties correlations. The spectroscopic results provide important
insights into the structure, composition, and properties of a putative Titanean mineral.
EXPERIMENTAL
Neutron Vibrational Spectroscopy. Data collection was performed on VISION (BL-16B) the neutron vibrational spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.26 The cocrystal was formed in situ via a 1:1
stoichiometric condensation of ammonia and acetylene. Ammonia and acetylene gases were added in equal volumes to the
sample can and allowed to mix for 10 minutes before the can
was crash cooled to 77 K. The vessel was then slowly cooled to
5 K over 2.5 hrs before data was collected. Measurements of
NVS and TOF-NPD were collected in tandem at (5, 50, 75, 93,
125, 150, and 175) K with 1-hr thermal equilibrations allowed
between steps. Upon reaching 175 K, the samples were allowed
to slowly cool back to 5 K under the same increments and NVS
and TOF-NPD were collected.

Data collection was performed on VISION (BL-16B) the neutron vibrational spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source
(SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. TOF-NPD patterns
were collected in tandem with NVS measurements, as described
above.
Diffraction Data Analysis. TOF-NPD data were analyzed using the GSAS-II software package.27 Space group, atomic and
lattice parameters were taken from the literature for each phase.
Specifically, Aeam for acetylene,28 P213 for ammonia,29 and
Ima2 for the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal.23 Precise lattice parameters, peak shapes, and background function were determined by Pawley refinement.30
Computational Studies. Density Functional Theory (DFT)
modeling was performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package (VASP).31 The calculation used Projector Augmented
Wave (PAW) method.32, 33 The optB86b-vdW functional34, 35
with dispersion corrections was applied. The energy cutoff was
800 eV for the plane-wave basis of the valence electrons. The
total energy tolerance for electronic energy minimization was
10-8 eV, and for structure optimization, it was 10-7 eV. The maximum interatomic force after relaxation was below 0.002 eV/Å.
The lattice parameters and atomic coordinates measured in this
work were used as the initial structure. Structural relaxation was
first performed on the ions only (with the lattice constants fixed
at the experimental values), after which full relaxation of the
cell was performed. The vibrational eigenfrequencies and
modes were then calculated by solving the force constants and
dynamical matrix using Phonopy.36 The OCLIMAX software37
was used to convert the DFT-calculated phonon results to the
simulated INS spectra.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
The acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal was synthesized by condensation and crystallization of equimolar amounts of ammonia
and acetylene gas at ambient pressure. To confirm the synthesis
of the cocrystal and to obtain information about the crystal
structure and stoichiometry of the solid, we collected and analyzed TOF-NPD data simultaneously while collecting the NVS
data. Figure 1A presents diffraction patterns for a 1:1 molar
combination of ammonia and acetylene collected at variable
temperatures upon heating of a crash-cooled sample from 5 K
to 175 K and later slowly cooled again to 5 K. The diffraction
data were analyzed by Pawley fitting against the reported unit
cell parameters of the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal, as
well as molecular crystalline ammonia and molecular crystalline acetylene (aluminum metal was added to account for the
Bragg reflections from the canister).
The analysis of the crashed-cooled sample clearly shows reflection from the 1:1 cocrystal, whose crystal structure is described
in the Iam2 space group.23 Figure 1B shows a region of the pattern containing coherent scattering from Bragg peaks of the cocrystal ((2 0 0) and (2 1 1) reflections), whose intensities grow
as a function of cooling. The cocrystal is presumably the thermodynamically most stable phase at low temperature and ambient pressure. However, due to kinetic effects and experimental limitations such as imperfect mixing and fast cooling,
certain amounts of unreacted ammonia and acetylene can be expected in the sample as molecular solids and have been observed in Figure 1. This situation is frequently observed in the
synthesis of numerous cocrystals.23-26
Upon gradual heating to 150 K, a characteristic thermal expansion is observed by a shift of the diffraction maxima to lower Q
values on heating (Figure 1A) and higher Q values upon cooling
(Figure 1B). This observation is consistent with the previously
reported large and anisotropic thermal expansion of the cocrystal.24 The thermal expansion continues upon heating to 150 K,
after which the cocrystal incongruently melts into solid

ammonia and a liquid mixture of ammonia and acetylene.24
Subsequent slow cooling of the mixed liquid revealed the same
processes in reverse order (Figure 1), resulting in crystallization
of the organic phases. It can be expected that the mechanism of
the cocrystal formation is driven by a peritectic transition of
solid ammonia and liquid acetylene, similar to other reported
solids.24 However, concurrent crystallization of all phases is
also a possibility when considering several other potential contributions. First, the melting points of ammonia and acetylene

are in close proximity (195.4 and 192.3 K, respectively), with a
∆T = 3.1 K. Second, there is a possibility of the formation of a
supercooled liquid that later crystallizes. Third, the formation
of crystals from any phase can seed the nucleation of other organic phases in the phase mixture.
Molecular crystalline ammonia and acetylene, for single-component systems, are the thermodynamically most stable forms
for each individual component. However, in a perfectly miscible binary mixture that features the formation of a cocrystal,
three crystalline solids—the cocrystal, ammonia, acetylene—
cannot coexist as three thermodynamically most stable phases.
All but one of these phases, depending on the conditions, must
be thermodynamically metastable. The observed coexistence of
molecular solids and a cocrystal results from kinetic effects.
The observation of kinetic effects, with trapping of metastable
phases at low temperatures, can have implications on the formation of the mineralogical makeup of the Titanean surface.
Kinetic trapping of metastable minerals has been observed on
Earth (e.g., cristobalite, a quenched high-temperature phase of
silica) and has been hypothesized for molecular minerals on Titan (e.g., a quenched high-temperature phase of acetonitrile).40
The occurrence of such metastable solids in this binary system
showcases the complexity of the phase equilibria that can exist
in higher-component mixed systems. Titan, in essence, is an extremely complicated mixture at a planetary scale. Therefore,
various kinetically trapped phases must be considered in the
modeling of the mineralogical makeup.
Figure 3 presents the NVS data collected as a function of heating of a crash-cooled sample (the spectroscopic data was collected simultaneously with the TOF-NPD patterns presented in
Figure 1). The NVS spectra had a clear temperature dependence, where strong vibrational signals were observed at low
temperatures as a result of lower thermal vibrations. Upon heating, the peak intensity decreased, and the broadness of the signals increased. The pronounced sensitivity of the NVS spectral
bands on thermal vibrations is limiting to the application of this
method in studies of the formation (crystallization) and melting

(fusion) of the cocrystal, which both happen at high temperatures. This observation exemplifies the advantage of using tandem NVS-Raman or NVS-IR approaches in detailed studies of
these systems considering the robustness of Raman or IR towards thermal vibrations. However, at low temperatures, the
NVS spectrum offers a comprehensive representation of the vibration modes including the phonon region.
Figure 4 presents an overlay of the NVS spectra at 5 K of the
cocrystal prepared via crash cooling and the cocrystal prepared
by heating and slow cooling of the sample. Expectedly, both
spectra contain vibrational peaks from the cocrystal; however,
both spectra have features that correspond to both the starting
materials and the cocrystal. For example, the ammonia rotational libration from the neat crystal can be seen from 28 meV
to 35 meV (225 cm-1 to 283 cm-1). Upon heating and subsequent
cooling of the sample to 5 K, most of these features disappear.
Table 1 presents a list of the observed vibrations for the cocrystal and their assignments. Spectral assignments were done
based on DFT theoretical calculations that resulted in a simulation of the spectra, shown in Figure 5. There is a good agreement between experiment and simulation in the overall profile
of the spectra, which allows us to assign the peaks to the corresponding vibrational modes. For some of the vibrational modes,
the peak positions (i.e., the calculated and measured frequencies) agree well, but for some other modes, especially the rotational libration of ammonia at around 10 meV, the calculated
frequencies are somewhat higher. This is not surprising because
the larger H displacements associated with the librational
modes often lead to anharmonicity (while the calculation was
performed under the harmonic approximation).

Pure component shifts for acetylene were gathered from the literature.41 Ammonia and cocrystal values are reported as measured on VISION. Negative values of Δν indicate a red shift (lower frequency) and positive values indicate a blue shift (higher frequency) in the cocrystal when compared to
the bare component vibrations.

Molecular crystals, especially those comprised of small organic
molecules, often feature properties such as colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion,24 plasticity (rotor phases),38 and similar macroscopic properties that originate from their unique
crystal packing and bonding. Changes in intermolecular interactions within the crystal packing can have major implications
on the physical properties. For example, in the crystal structure
of solid ammonia (Figure 6A) there is a continuous network of
strong N-H hydrogen bonding, with N-H···N bond distances of
2.556(4) Å and N to N interatomic distances of 3.947(7) Å. As
such, this crystal structure is not prone to dynamic disorder and
does not exhibit plasticity. On the other hand, acetylene relies
primarily on π–π and weak hydrogen π–cloud interactions as the
main interaction within the crystal structure (Figure 6B). Nonetheless, presumably due to the geometrical simplicity of the
molecule, this structure also does not exhibit plasticity. Interestingly, the 1:1 cocrystal shows pronounced dynamic disorder
and plasticity.38,39 The cocrystal has hydrogen bonding interactions between the ammonia nitrogen center and the acetylene CH bond. The NH···N hydrogen bonding interaction is stronger
in the cocrystal than in the bare ammonia structure demonstrated by its shorter intermolecular C-H···N distance of

2.538(2) Å. The ammonia molecules within this packing rotate
on picosecond time scales.38 The dramatic change in the hydrogen bonding environment in the single-component solids vs. 1:1
cocrystal is also expected to be manifested in the NVS spectra
with pronounced shifts in the energy of the phonon and vibrational modes.
Comparison of the vibration modes of ammonia in the hydrogen-bonded structure in the single-component crystal vs. the
more “loosely” packed environment in the 1:1 cocrystal corroborates the emergence of a rotor phase. In the molecular solid,
the N-H···N hydrogen bonding interaction is strong, thus resulting in an energy transfer for the rotational libration mode to be
relatively high energy, detected at 28 meV - 35 meV (225 cm-1
- 293 cm-1) in the NVS spectra. This change in the energy of the
vibration can be attributed to a few factors that are elucidated
by the crystal structures shown in Figure 6. In the cocrystal, the
four strong hydrogen bonding interactions in solid ammonia are

disrupted and replaced by two hydrogen bonding interactions
between the acetylene C-H as the hydrogen bonding donor, with
the nitrogen lone pair from ammonia as the hydrogen bonding
acceptor. Importantly, this bonding puts almost no restriction to
the NH3 rotational libration, which is very different from the NH···N hydrogen bonding that “locks” the three “legs” of the
NH3 molecule in the ammonia crystal. In the neat NH3 crystal,
there is a strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the adjacent NH3 molecules. As the peritectic reaction between ammonia and acetylene proceeds, the lattice expands in order to
incorporate the acetylene molecule. The acetylene:ammonia
(1:1) cocrystal orients in a chain-like manner,23 where each CH bond of acetylene behaves as a hydrogen bond donor to the
neighboring ammonia molecules. Effectively, the incorporation
of acetylene into the ammonia lattice results in the displacement
of the previously established N-H···N interaction with much
stronger hydrogen bond donor, as reflected in their distinct pKa
values, 32.5 for NH3 and 25 for C2H2 and thereby contributing
to the shorter C-H···N hydrogen bond length. As a result, the
same NH3 rotational libration in the acetylene:ammonia (1:1)
cocrystal is now dramatically red-shifted and is detected at 9
meV to 13 meV (73 cm-1 to 105 cm-1) with a colossal Δν of 19
meV to 22 meV (153 cm-1 to 177 cm-1).
Two other peaks originating from ammonia also have appreciable red-shifts in the NVS spectra when comparing the neat crystals to the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal. Namely, the NH3
rocking libration, which was observed at 36 meV to 45 meV
(290 cm-1 to 363 cm-1), and the NH3 umbrella bend seen at 135
meV (1088 cm-1) in the neat crystal of ammonia. Both peaks
had a modest red-shift associated with the cocrystal formation,
The NH3 rocking libration was modestly redshifted by 1 meV
to 2 meV (8 cm-1 to 16 cm-1), and the NH3 umbrella bend was
redshifted up to 5 meV (40 cm-1). These redshifts of NH3 vibrational modes are again a result of the less restrictive hydrogen
bonding network and packing environment in the cocrystal,
compared to the neat ammonia crystal, although they are less
dramatic than the NH3 rotational libration.
Other characteristic shifts observed in the NVS spectrum of the
cocrystal arise from the C2H2 symmetric and asymmetric bending. The acetylene asymmetric bending mode in the neat acetylene crystal has an expected energy transfer of 80 meV (645 cm1
). In the cocrystal, this mode is observed from 82 meV to 93
meV (660 cm-1 to 750 cm-1) representing an overall blue shift
of this vibration of 2 meV to 13 meV (16 cm-1 -105 cm-1). For
the acetylene symmetric bending, the neat acetylene crystal has
this mode predicted and observed at 95 meV (766 cm-1). This
acetylene symmetric bending has a similar blue shift associated
with the cocrystal formation, where now this bend is observed
between 95 meV to 110 meV (766 cm-1 - 887 cm-1) corresponding to an overall shift of 0 meVto 15 meV (0 cm-1 to 121 cm-1).
These blueshifts of the bending modes can be explained by the
C-H···N hydrogen bond which is perpendicular to the C-H
bond in the acetylene molecule and is thus along the direction
of the bending motion.

phase composition of the cocrystal were confirmed by Pawley
fitting analyses of TOF-NPD patterns, collected in tandem with
the spectroscopic data. The crystallographic data have revealed
that the cocrystal is the major phase in the system, but measurable amounts of the single-component reactant solids have also
been detected due to kinetic effects during the synthesis of the
cocrystal. The spectral assignment of the vibrational modes observed in the NVS data was done based on DFT modeling. Colossal shifts have been detected in the cocrystal, compared to
the single-component solids. Most notably, the NH3 rotational
libration in the cocrystal was found to be dramatically redshifted to lower energies. This shift results from the breaking
up the strong hydrogen bonding environment of the bare ammonia structure and replacing the four sets of hydrogen donor/acceptor pairs and replacing them with two C-H···N interactions. This results in a less rigidly bound NH3 unit which can
more readily rotate. The shift to lower energies and a weaker
hydrogen bonding environment corroborates the previously observed plastic (rotor) behavior of the cocrystal. Other ammonia
peaks also had appreciable red-shifts, including the NH3 rocking libration and the NH3 umbrella bend. Characteristic shifts
of the C2H2 molecule were observed with its symmetric and
asymmetric bending. Overall, the established spectra–properties correlations for the cocrystal corroborate the observed
structural and macroscopic properties. To the best of our
knowledge, this study presents the first example of the application of neutron vibrational spectroscopy in the study of Titanrelevant organic minerals. Having no symmetry selection rules,
and being extremely sensitive to hydrogen atoms, NVS is an
excellent method for the study of hydrocarbon and molecular
solids as putative minerals on Titan.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, here we have presented a detailed NVS, TOF-NPD
and theoretical study of the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal
that is a putative organic mineral on Titan, comets, and potentially other planetary bodies. First, the synthesis, structure, and
