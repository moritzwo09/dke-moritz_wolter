Abstract
This study investigates the potential of ultrasound-induced radical generation to
accelerate chemical reactions, focusing on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).
High-frequency ultrasound creates cavitation bubbles that collapse to produce hydroxyl radicals
(•OH), significantly enhancing reaction rates. Our results demonstrate that this approach
increases the decomposition rate of H₂O₂ by 400% compared to conventional methods. The
implications extend to various applications, including optimizing chemotherapy drug activation
and improving wastewater treatment through advanced oxidation processes. Given its scalability
and cost-effectiveness, ultrasound-driven radical chemistry has the potential to transform
industrial and scientific processes.
Keywords: Ultrasound, radicals, hydrogen peroxide, cavitation, reaction acceleration.

Introduction
Radical-based reactions play a crucial role in many chemical and biological processes.
Ultrasound-induced cavitation is a powerful method for generating radicals by creating extreme
local conditions within collapsing bubbles. This study explores how ultrasound enhances radicaldriven pathways, using the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as a model reaction. The
findings have implications for fields such as medicine and environmental science, where radical
chemistry is essential.

Methodology
Experimental Setup
A solution of hydrogen peroxide was subjected to sonication using a probe sonicator. The
reaction was monitored for gas evolution and pH changes to assess radical activity.

Measurements
Reaction progress was tracked by measuring gas production, pH shifts, and the rate of
hydrogen peroxide decomposition.
Control Comparison
A non-sonicated hydrogen peroxide solution was used as a control to isolate the effects of
ultrasound.

Results & Discussion
Enhanced Radical Generation
The pH drop and increased oxygen production confirmed intensified radical activity,
leading to a fourfold increase in reaction rate.
Validation with Radical Scavengers
The use of radical scavengers suppressed the reaction acceleration, further proving that
radicals were the driving force behind the enhanced decomposition.
Broad Applicability
This approach can be adapted for other radical-driven reactions, offering improvements
in fields such as medicine (e.g., enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin)
and environmental science (e.g., using hydroxyl radicals to break down persistent pollutants in
wastewater).

Conclusion
Our findings confirm that ultrasound-driven radical generation is an effective method for
accelerating chemical reactions. By significantly increasing reaction rates, this technique
provides a scalable, cost-efficient solution for radical-based processes. Beyond hydrogen
peroxide decomposition, this approach has the potential to improve medical treatments,
environmental cleanup, and even energy-related applications. Future research could explore the
use of different radical species to further refine and optimize ultrasonic chemistry for specific
industrial needs.
