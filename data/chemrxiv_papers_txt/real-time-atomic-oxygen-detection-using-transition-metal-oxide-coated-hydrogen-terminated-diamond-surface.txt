Abstract
Atomic oxygen (AO) is a major cause for the deterioration of spacecraft materials, such as
polymers, composites and optical coatings, in low Earth orbit (LEO). AO exposure can degrade
thermal, mechanical, or optical system performance, potentially leading to premature mission
failure. Future missions, especially for remote sensing, are designed for very low Earth orbit
(VLEO) where the variations of thermospheric density and AO flux are more significant than in
higher orbits. Therefore, accurate real-time assessment of the AO fluence impinging upon
spacecraft surfaces becomes a crucial issue for mission success, as well as for improving current
thermospheric density models.
We present a compact, solid-state sensor with high sensitivity and fast response to AO. The
sensor is based on two semiconductor components that exhibit unique electrical properties when
assembled together: hydrogenated diamond substrate and transition-metal oxide (TMO) coating.
The Diamond:H-Transitional Metal Oxide AO sensor (DiMO) was characterized using RF plasmabased and laser detonation AO facilities. Tungsten oxide, WO3, with thickness ranging from 6 nm

to 30 nm was used as TMO coating of choice. The results showed a linear increase in electrical
resistance as a function of AO fluence of up to 2×1020 O-atoms∙cm-2, as tested in a laser detonation
AO beam facility. The sensitivity of the sensor was found to be tunable, ranging from 10-14 to 1015

Ω∙O-atoms-1∙cm2, and inversely dependent on the coating thickness. This work demonstrates the

potential usage of diamond-based devices for VLEO real-time AO flux monitoring. Furthermore,
compact dimensions and minimal power consumption of the DiMO sensor make it an ideal lowcost solution for the emerging "new-space" era, including nanosatellites applications.

Introduction

1.1 Low and very low Earth orbit environment
In low and very low Earth orbit (LEO and VLEO, respectively) altitudes, ranging from 200
to 700 km, the hazardous space environment includes atomic oxygen (AO), UV radiation, ionizing
radiation (electrons and protons), ultra-high vacuum, thermal cycles, as well as micrometeoroids
and debris. However, AO, formed by UV-induced molecular oxygen dissociation, is considered to
be the most hazardous for external satellite surfaces, due to its oxidative and erosive potential. The
AO that constitutes the VLEO/LEO environment has a density of 107 -1010 cm-3 and a relatively
low kinetic temperature of 800-1000 K (70-90 meV), depending on altitude and solar activity 1.
Thus, the external surfaces of any spacecraft orbiting at LEO/VLEO altitudes will be exposed to
collisions with AO. The typical orbiting speed of a spacecraft in LEO orbit is roughly 8 km∙s-1,
hence the impact energy and flux of the AO on the surface can be as high as ~4.5 - 5 eV and 10131015 O-atoms∙cm-2∙s-1, respectively 2. The AO density, and, consequently, flux depend on the

altitude, the solar activity variation, the orbital inclination and the time of year, thus it is
particularly challenging to predict and measure. Advances in spacecraft propulsion systems, such
as the development of efficient ion engines, make VLEO accessible for prolonged space missions.
Ion engines allow satellites to sustain VLEOs below 400 km for extended periods of time,
overcoming the residual atmosphere drag. At these heights the typical AO flux is high (up to 1015
O-atoms∙cm-2∙s-1) 2 further exacerbating erosion and oxidation damage compared to higher orbits,
making essential the need for monitoring AO in real-time.
AO is the major consideration for the protection of the external spacecraft surface since it
causes a significant deterioration of polymer-based materials and optical coatings 2-5. Ground and
space-borne experiments have shown that prolonged exposure of sensitive spacecraft materials to
the LEO environment causes degradation of thermal, mechanical, and optical properties, which
can significantly affect mission performance and may even result in premature mission failure 2, 47

. In addition, AO is the major contributor to spacecraft drag in LEO and VLEO orbits 8, 9. Thus,

the assessment of the total AO fluence a spacecraft surfaces and subsystems will be exposed to
during the mission is crucial for reliability of the whole mission. AO fluence is routinely estimated
during the spacecraft design and mission planning stages by applying computer simulation models
6, 10

. These models base their calculations on data observations from atmospheric, weather, and

solar activity conditions 11, 12. However, the lack of AO prediction accuracy might cause
considerable additional expenses for external surfaces protection. Therefore, any new data
obtained in-flight regarding the dependence of the AO flux on the various parameters, and
specifically the dependence on solar activity, will significantly improve quality of the AO density
calculations. This will allow accurate forecasting of spacecraft lifetime which leads to a more costeffective spacecraft design. Furthermore, real-time AO monitoring during the mission can be used

to estimate exposure levels of sensitive equipment and manage its protection from AO in case of
unexpected high solar activity. Moreover, it can also help to evaluate the atmospheric drag
experienced by the spacecraft. Additionally, real time AO measurements may be used as a source
of mapping information for solar activity 13, 14.
1.2 AO sensing methods
During the past years, several AO sensing methods have been proposed for real-time
monitoring of the AO fluence 15-22. The earliest approach used a space-borne mass spectrometer
and was applied extensively in LEO-material interaction experiments performed by NASA 7, 16, 23,
24

. This method is inherently expensive due to the size and complexity of such devices. Therefore,

it was used only in specific experiments where the mass spectrometer versatility was required to
examine material interactions with the LEO environment. In these experiments mass spectrometers
were used to measure both the AO flux and the surface reaction products.
Another method is based on Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) 25. In this method, a
quartz crystal is coated with a thin layer of a material with known AO erosion yield (such as
KaptonTM, carbon, or silver). The resonant frequency of the quartz crystal depends on its mass, so
any reduction in the mass of the material on its surface due to erosion will affect the frequency.
Thus, as erosion occurs, the change in frequency is related to the AO flux 15, 16, 25, 26. QCMs are
relatively small, lightweight, and highly accurate. However, they require a complex and expensive
electronic control unit. Additionally, the measurement dynamic range is limited by the thickness
of the reference material: once the reference material is fully eroded, the AO flux can no longer be
measured.
A more cost-effective method is the use of optical based sensors 17-19. These sensors rely
on the measurement of the light intensity passing through a material with known erosion yield

4

such as KaptonTM or VespelTM in order to detect AO fluence. The detected light intensity can be
correlated to the material thickness and, therefore, the AO fluence can be estimated. However, this
method is highly affected by light scattering from the etched surface of the exposed material 17, 18.
Therefore, in order to increase the accuracy of the measurement, the use of a dedicated light source
with a known and constant intensity, in addition to calibration and analysis using different light
frequencies, are required 19.
Another cost-effective method includes the use of actinometers 15, 16. Actinometer is a
sensor that changes its electric resistance when its conductive element is exposed to AO. The
change in resistance is caused either by erosion of the conductive element, conversion to a nonconducting oxide, or by changes to the material’s electronic structure. Knowledge of the element’s
electrical characteristics and its response to AO exposure provides the means for converting
resistance measurements into AO flux/fluence values. Actinometers are usually more compact and
require low power to operate compared to other sensing methods 16, 22, 27. Hence, actinometer based
sensors are well suited for future “new space” missions involving nano and micro satellites where
the size, weight, and power requirements of the sensor are the major limiting factors.
The most used sensing materials to date are silver and carbon, because they have a
relatively high reaction rate with AO, they are reasonably inexpensive and are easy to handle.
However, much like the QCM method, carbon and silver film actinometers are restricted to
missions of limited duration, as the material becomes permanently eroded and/or oxidized by AO.
Alternatively, solid-state actinometers that detect changes in electronic properties caused by
oxygen interaction processes, other than erosion, have the potential to offer both increased
detection sensitivity and higher saturation limits. An actinometer based on graphene was reported
22

and a ZnO-semiconductor-based actinometer has been proposed with regeneration capability,

5

making repeated measurements of the AO flux 27 possible. However, it reaches saturation at a
relatively low AO fluence, and the regeneration process requires heating for a prolonged period of
time (15 hours at 80 °C) 27. An actinometer based on the etching of boron-doped diamond has also
been proposed and shown to be capable of measuring AO fluences as high as 4×1020 O-atoms∙cm2 28

. Due to the requirement to detect relatively small changes in resistance, the device uses several

Wheatstone bridge elements in a specific configuration, which complicates the accurate analysis.

1.3 Transition metal oxide coated hydrogen-terminated diamond
In this work we propose a novel actinometer, based on the electronic properties of a
diamond surface coated with a thin layer of transition metal oxide (TMO). This sensor, further
denoted as DiMO, has several potential advantages such as long active lifetime, high durability to
the space environment, and low power consumption. These advantages make it a highly effective,
low-cost solution for real-time AO fluence measurements in LEO and VLEO missions, as well as
in ground simulation systems.
DiMO is based on the ability to render the diamond surface as p-type conductive by a
process of surface transfer doping (TD) and the ability to affect this process through exposure to
oxygen species 29-33. TD is the result of a charge-exchange between a hydrogen terminated
diamond (Diamond:H) and a lower energetic surface acceptor. So far, Diamond:H is the only
semiconductor for which a true negative electron affinity (NEA) can be achieved 34. The C-H bond
on the terminated surface is polarized with a positive charge on the H atom and a negative charge
on the C atom. This potential step pulls the vacuum level below the conduction band minimum
(CBM) over the distance of the C-H bond length. The maximum NEA measured in hydrogen
terminated (100)-oriented diamond by a combination of photoemission and Kelvin probe

6

experiments was -1.3 eV 35. The NEA induces p-type surface conductivity in air-exposed
Diamond:H through an electrochemical charge-exchange with moisture adsorbates on the diamond
surface 35. The effect of this charge-exchange on the electronic properties of the diamond surface
was thoroughly investigated and the resulting band bending was effectively measured using
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) among other
spectroscopic methods 29.
Superior surface conductivity and more stable TD of Diamond:H have been demonstrated
with various TMOs, yielded the highest yet reported p-type surface conductivity, and enabled the
development of several attractive electronic devices 32, 33, 36-38. TMOs, such as MoO3, WO3, V2O5,
and ReO3, are highly interesting semiconductors (Eg~3eV) due to their deep-lying conduction band
and high work function values. Work function is crucial for determining the energetic requirements
of transferring electrons to and from a solid until electrodynamic equilibrium is reached. Therefore,
TMOs serve as efficient low-lying electron acceptors, and are extensively used for TD of
Diamond:H. The TD process in this case involves electrons transferring from the energy levels of
diamond valence band maximum (VBM) to the CBM of the TMO coating which is located at a
lower energy level, as seen in Figure 1 (a) and (b). This favorable band alignment is due to the
combination of the Diamond:H surface's NEA and the large work function of the TMO. The TMO
work function can be reduced upon exposure to oxygen and residual moisture, or alternatively, it
can increase with increasing TMO layer thickness. This phenomenon is attributed to the tendency
of the exposed TMO to alter its O-vacancy concentration, which acts as electronic donors when
exposed to oxygen species 39-41.
The reduction in the TMO work function was found to be the cause of a reduction in the
diamond p-type conductivity. As the reduction in TMO work function alters the electronic energy

band alignment between the TMO CBM and the VBM of the diamond surface, it initiates a
reduction in charge transfer, as seen schematically in Figure 1(c) 31. Although this is an unwanted
effect when designing diamond/TMO electronic devices based on TD 36-38, DiMO takes advantage
of this effect to detect impinging oxygen. The decrease in electrical conductivity of the diamond
surface can be correlated with the oxygen fluence during the exposure. Thus, by monitoring
changes in conductivity and using a pre-measured calibration function, DiMO-based sensor can
be used to deduce the oxygen flux and fluence in real time. In addition, it is possible to regenerate
the TMO work function to its pre-exposed value by an annealing process 42, potentially increasing
the AO detection lifetime.

WO3 electron affinity, ϕA is the WO3 work function before (yellow) and after (green) oxygen
exposure, χ is the diamond electron affinity (negative due to H surface termination).
In this work, we demonstrate the correlation between DiMO resistance and AO fluence
through exposure to (i) ozone, generated by a standard ozone generator, (ii) atomic oxygen,
produced by a modified RF oxygen plasma source, and (iii) hyperthermal 5 eV oxygen atoms
generated by a laser detonation AO source. Two types of the TMO coating were tested. MoO3 was
chosen for the evaluation tests using ozone exposure due to its well documented role in inducing
TD p-type conductivity in diamond, as well as its sensitivity to oxygen exposure 32, 40. However,
the TMO coating of choice for further studies was tungsten trioxide, WO3, which induces a p-type
conductive surface layer with electrical properties being superior to those induced by other TMOs
33

, enabling higher initial conductivity than the MoO3 coated samples used for the preliminary

ozone exposure. At the first stage, MoO3-coated Diamond:H was exposed to ozone in UV ozone
generator. The observed changes in the charge carrier concentration allowed to determine the
appropriate minimal TMO coating thickness. Following these experiments, DiMO sensors with
thicker TMO coating made of WO3 were exposed to oxygen generated by RF plasma and laser
detonation AO source. The assessed AO fluence was compared to the LEO equivalent AO fluence,
calculated from the erosion of a KaptonTM reference sample. The sensitivity of the WO3-based
DiMO sensor to AO exposure as a function of the TMO coating thickness was studied.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 DiMO sensor fabrication
The DiMO device is composed of a Diamond:H substrate, coated with a thin layer of TMO
containing four contacts which enable surface resistance measurement, as depicted schematically
9

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qh9rh ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8219-9134 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

in Figure 2. The fabrication of the DiMO sensor consists of several stages, including hydrogenation
of diamond surface, application of TMO coating, and sensor wiring. The diamond substrates are
commercially available chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown type IIa diamonds, purchased
from Element SixTM. The substrates are rectangular with dimensions of 3 mm × 3 mm × 0.25 mm
and polished surfaces with roughness of Rq<30 nm. They are highly pure and electrically
insulating, with a nitrogen concentration lower than 1 ppm and boron concentration lower than
0.05 ppm. In addition, the crystal orientation of the substrate faces is <100> which was chosen due
to its high durability to AO and its ability to achieve high NEA when hydrogen terminated,
enabling high p-type conductivity via TD 35, 43, 44.
The diamond substrates were hydrogen-terminated by exposure to pure hydrogen plasma
in a microwave chemical vapor deposition (MW-CVD) system. The MW-CVD reactor that was
used is an Applied Science and Technology (ASTeX) AX5010 reactor. The diamond substrates
were exposed to hydrogen plasma induced by a microwave power of 900 W at a temperature of
640 °C and a pressure of 60 Torr for 40 min. Following surface hydrogenation, the diamond
substrates were coated with TMO. The coating was performed using thermal evaporation system.
For both MoO3 and WO3 coatings, the diamond substrates were heated to 350 °C, in-situ,
to desorb any moisture and contaminants from the surface. The thickness of MoO3 was between
1.5 nm to 3.8 nm, while the thickness of WO3 layer varied between 6 nm to 30 nm. The coated
surface of the electrically conductive Diamond:H/WO3 samples was characterized using scanning
electron microscope (SEM) (Zeiss Sigma 300 VP SEM) using a low energy, 1 keV electron beam.
SEM was equipped with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Bruker Xflash
1|60). In addition, atomic force microscope (AFM) (Nanoscope IV MultiMode from Veeco) was
used to assess surface roughness. The measurements were performed in tapping mode using a

silicon cantilever with a resonance frequency of 79-94 kHz. The AFM image analysis was
performed using Gwyddion SPM data visualization and analysis software 45.

Figure 2: Schematic representation of the DiMO sensor, based on a 3 mm × 3 mm diamond coated
with TMO.
Schematic diagram of the coated diamond wiring is shown in Figure 3. The coated DiMO
diamond substrates were fixed to a standard printed circuit board (PCB) using a double-sided
adhesive carbon tape. Four wire poles (Gore™ AO durable wires) were soldered to the PCB
through holes via connectors. These wires were connected to the diamond sample using delicate
45 m Au coated molybdenum wires attached to the diamond surface in a square configuration
using silver paint, see Figure 3(a). In order to prevent damage to the oxygen-sensitive silver
contacts, a bismaleimide - based dielectric coating (Designer Molecules, BMI 689) 46 was used as
a cover layer, as shown in Figure 3 (b) and (c). In addition, a 125 m-thick Kapton™ mask was
used to cover the front of the PCB, leaving a 2 mm-diameter opening to expose the center of the
DiMO sensor to the oxygen flux. The final PCB setup can be seen in Figure 3(d).

coating. (c) Diamond sample electrically connected to four wire poles using Au coated
molybdenum wires and silver paint covered with BMI polymer. (d) The entire PCB covered using
a Kapton™ mask with a 2 mm diameter opening allowing oxygen exposure of the DiMO surface.
2.2 Ozone exposure
Three MoO3-coated diamond samples were prepared with a thickness of 1.5 nm, 2.8 nm,
and 3.8 nm, respectively. The samples were exposed to ozone for 180 hours using a Novascan
Technologies PSDP UV Ozone generator. The surface charge carrier concentration and sheet
resistance were measured periodically using a Van der Pauw (VDP) Hall effect system. During the
measurements the sample temperature was stabilized at 25 °C using a THMS600 Linkam stage.
The current was supplied using a Keithley 220 programmable current source and measured using
a Keithley 485 pico-amperemeter. Each of the four contacts was connected to a very high input
impedance (TΩ) Keithley 6514 electrometer designed for voltage measurements in high resistivity
samples. The voltage difference between each of the two electrometers was measured using a
Keithley 2000 multimeter. The current source, electrometers, multimeter and sample contacts were

connected to a Keithley 7001 switch. Hall effect carrier concentration measurements were
performed under a magnetic field of 8000 Gauss induced on the sample. All elements in the system
were connected to a PC using a General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) interface and controlled
using the Keithley Testpoint software.

2.3 RF oxygen plasma exposure
The WO3-based DiMO sensors were exposed to an RF oxygen plasma source,
schematically shown in Figure 4, and described in our prior works 47, 48. The source is based on a
Litmas RPS RF plasma reactor, a Tylan FC-260 mass flow controller valve regulating the oxygen
flow, and an Adixon dry vacuum pump. The exposure was performed with an oxygen flow of 5
standard cubic centimeter per minute (SCCM) resulting in a pressure of 2.5×10-2 Torr in the
exposure chamber. The plasma was ignited by applying RF radiation with a power of 1000 W. The
exposure chamber is located down the pumping stream, away from the plasma source. At this
position, the sample is exposed to ground state and electronically excited AO species, and to a
relatively low current of ions and electrons originated from the plasma 47. The system is equipped
with a temperature-controlled QCM. 6 MHz gold-plated QCM crystals were spin-coated with
poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,4-oxidianiline) (PMDA-ODA) films using a polyamic acid
(Pyralin® PI 2545 from HD MicroSystems), as described in 49. Chemical structure of the deposited
polyimide (PI) films is similar to that of KaptonTM 49. The LEO equivalent of AO fluence was
calculated from the mass loss of a PI layer deposited on the QCM as per ASTM E2089, using the
following equation:
(1)

F=∆m/AρE

13

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qh9rh ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8219-9134 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

where ∆m is the mass loss (g), A is the exposed area (cm2), ρ is the density of PI (1.42 g·cm-3), F
is the AO fluence (O-atoms∙cm-2), and E is the erosion yield of Kapton H PI (3×10-24 cm3∙O-atom1 50

) .
The DiMO sensor was mounted close to the QCM, as shown in Figure 4(a). The four-point

resistance measurement was performed using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit (SMU). The
SMU served as a current source and as a voltmeter connected to the DiMO in a square contact
configuration. The resistance measurement was performed by applying a current of 20 A to two
of the contacts and by monitoring of voltage drop between the other two. A National Instruments
(NI) 9205 16 bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was connected in parallel to the SMU in order
to provide real-time data acquisition of the voltage measurement during the experiment, as shown
in Figure 4(b).
During the experiment both the PI mass loss data and changes in the voltage, induced on
DiMO sensor, were measured and logged simultaneously. This was achieved by connecting the
QCM Sycon STM-100/MF controller output to an NI 6008 ADC and the DiMO sensor voltage to
an NI 9205 ADC. As seen in Figure 4(a), the DiMO sensor was located about 1 cm behind the
QCM crystal plane which is perpendicular to the pump flow. Thus, the fluence measured using the
QCM can serve as a good estimate of the fluence impinging on the sensor surface. During the
experiment, the voltages of the two NI 9205 inputs were logged using a LabVIEW Signal Express
software and the QCM voltage signal was converted to thickness values.

2.4 Laser detonation AO facility
Two DiMO sensors were exposed to the well-characterized hyperthermal AO beam in a
facility with a laser detonation source, described in detail previously 51-53, and shown schematically
in Figure 5(a). In this source, a pulsed valve is coupled to an expanding conical nozzle and a pulsed
CO2 TEA laser (Compact 05/50, PaR Systems), operating at ~9 J pulse and 2 Hz repetition rate.
The source is capable of producing beams containing 70 − 85% O(3P) atoms, with the rest being
molecular oxygen 54. The characterization of the O/O2 beam was performed during the exposure
by a time-of-flight (TOF) measurements using a custom modified Extrel MAX120 quadrupole
mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer signal is collected for species with m/z of 16 for O, 32

for O2, and 23 for a background check where no signal is expected. These measurements yield a
number density distribution as a function of time N(t). The probability density distributions for
velocity and energy, P(v) and P(E), respectively, are determined from the N(t) distributions using
the total flight distance, defined from the nozzle throat to the ionizer of the mass spectrometer, and
the relations P(V) ∝ t N(t) and P(E) ∝ t2 N(t) 55. A typical velocity and translational energy
distributions of O and O2, obtained in the present work, are represented in Figure 5(b). The mole
ratios of O and O2 in the hyperthermal beam are approximately 0.74 and 0.26, respectively. The
average velocity of the beam is around 7500 m·s-1 and the translational energy of the O atoms is
approximately 4.7 eV.
Two DiMO sensors were mounted on the sample holder edge, located at a distance of 40
cm from the nozzle throat, as shown in Figure 6(a). A reference Kapton H sample, covered with a
metal mesh screen and mounted in the center position of the sample holder, was used for
measurements of the total AO fluence based on Kapton H erosion depth 52. The DiMO sensor
resistance was measured using two Keithley 2000 Digital Multimeter (one for each sample) in a
simplified two-point method, as shown schematically in Figure 6(b). The two multimeters were
connected to a PC and their data were collected using a dedicated MATLAB script with sampling
intervals of 15-60 s.

exposure by measuring the erosion depth of Kapton H reference sample with a Dektak3 surface
profiler (Veeco Metrology Group, Santa Barbara, CA), using Eq. (1). The beam was stable
throughout the experiment, hence the exposure time can be used to calculate the average AO flux.
This was done by dividing the total AO fluence by the total exposure time, obtaining LEO
equivalent AO flux of 4.4×1015 O-atoms∙cm-2∙s-1.

3. Results
3.1. DiMO surface characterization
The key step of the DiMO sensor fabrication is the deposition of a thin, uniform TMO
coating on a hydrogenated diamond surface. In the main experiments of the DiMO sensor, we used
thermally-evaporated WO3 coatings with thickness ranging from 6 to 30 nm. Figure 7 shows a
SEM image of the surface of a diamond substrate before and after deposition of a 20 nm WO3
coating. Rectangular pits and triangular features are clearly seen on the hydrogenated diamond
surface in Figure 7(a). These features are typical to CVD grown diamond 56. The fine grains seen
in Figure 7(b) are the grains of the WO3 surface coating. Overall surface roughness increased upon
coating, as seen in the images. The presence of the WO3 coating on the diamond surface was
confirmed by EDS (not shown), as indicated by the presence of tungsten (~1.3 at. %), oxygen (~0.5
at. %), along with carbon (98.2 at. %) characteristic X-Ray lines. Further evidence of the coating

uniformity and roughness was obtained using AFM measurements, see Figure 7(c). The RMS
roughness, Rq, of the Diamond:H/WO3 sample was found to be 6 nm.

3.2 Ozone exposure
Diamond:H samples coated with 1.5 nm, 2.8 nm, and 3.8 nm of MoO3 were exposed to
ozone for 180 hours and their charge carrier concentration and sheet conductivity were measured
periodically using the VDP measurement technique. The results, depicted in Figure 8, show a
significant reduction in carrier concentration and electrical conductance with increasing exposure

for all exposed samples. These results clearly indicate that the reduction in the diamond surface
conductivity is the result of reduction in the carrier (hole) concentration at the surface. The
reduction in carrier concentration can be associated with reduced TD due to changes of the
electronic properties at the TMO – H:Diamond interface induced by oxygen exposure. The 1.5 nm
coated sample exhibited the most rapid change in its electronic properties, reducing its carrier
concentration and sheet conductance by two orders of magnitude after approximately 50 hours of
exposure, while apparently reaching saturation by the end of the exposure. Similarly, the 2.8 nm
coated sample showed a rapid reduction in conductivity by one order of magnitude after ~50 hours
of exposure, gradually approaching saturation at the end of the 180 hours exposure. In contrast,
the 3.8 nm coated sample showed a moderate and roughly linear reduction in electrical
conductivity, achieving a reduction by one order of magnitude after 180 hours of exposure.
Moreover, unlike the 1.5 nm and 2.8 nm coated samples, the reduction in electrical conductivity
of the 3.8 nm coated sample did not approach saturation after 180 hours of exposure. These results
correlate well with the observation that oxygen exchange and diffusion in TMOs rapidly reaches
a maximum depth of a 1 nm to 2.5 nm, irrelevant of the oxide structure 41. Therefore, during the
exposure of both the 1.5 nm and 2.8 nm MoO3-coated samples, the entire layer thickness was
quickly affected, including the TMO at the diamond interface, resulting in the maximum change
in conductivity. However, in the case of the 3.8 nm coated sample, the TMO - diamond interface
area was affected gradually, leading to a slower change in its electrical properties, and
consequently to slower changes in the TD-induced diamond conductivity. Therefore, a TMO
coating thickness greater than 4 nm was chosen for the DiMO sensors fabricated for the AO
exposure in the RF plasma and in the laser detonation source facility.

Figure 8: Diamond:H/MoO3 carrier concentration and surface conductivity as a response to ozone
exposure for different thicknesses layers of MoO3 ranging from 1.5 nm to 3.8 nm.
3.3 DiMO exposure to RF Oxygen plasma
As mentioned above, WO3 was selected as the choice of TMO due to its ability to induce
higher TD surface conductivity compared to MoO3, potentially increasing DiMO sensitivity and
measurement range. Two DiMO sensors, coated with 6 nm and 20 nm thick layers of WO3, were
exposed to RF oxygen plasma in the afterglow region with a reduced concentration of ions and
charged oxygen molecular species 47. Using DiMO sensor electrical resistance data and the AO
fluence as measured by the QCM for each exposure experiment, a plot of the diamond resistance
as a function of the LEO-equivalent AO fluence was generated for each sample and is depicted in
Figure 9. The resistance changes during the exposure of the DiMO sample coated with 6 nm WO3
are shown in Figure 9(a). These changes can be categorized into three main regimes. First, the

conductivity starts to increase gradually after exposure to 5×1017 O-atoms∙cm-2. Then, roughly at
a fluence equivalent to 1.9×1018 O-atoms∙cm-2 the diamond surface resistance increases linearly
with AO fluence. Finally, after exposure to approximately 3.4×1018 O-atoms∙cm-2, the diamond
resistance reaches saturation. The saturation step was observed in all samples tested in the RF
plasma source. It is attributed to the protective BMI coating and KaptonTM cover mask shown in
Figure 3(d): the KaptonTM cover mask allows for only a circular area at the center of the diamond
surface to be exposed to oxygen species, while the rest of the diamond surface is left unexposed
and electrically conductive.

Figure 9(b) depicts the change in resistance of the 20 nm WO3-coated DiMO sample as a
function of exposure up to AO fluence of 1×1020 O-atoms∙cm-2. In this case, we observed the linear
dependence of the DiMO resistance on the LEO equivalent AO fluence from the start of the
exposure up to saturation at approximately 9×1019 O-atoms∙cm-2 while overall resistance was more

than twice lower. This value was one and a half order of magnitude higher than the AO fluence
saturation value measured for the 6 nm WO3-coated DiMO sample.
Using simple linear fitting procedure, a linear calibration function between the WO3-coated
diamond resistance and the LEO equivalent AO fluence was extracted from the linear part of the
data gathered during the exposure experiments of both samples:
(2)

[Fluence (O-atoms∙cm-2)] = A× [Resistance (Ω)] – B

Here parameter A represents the AO fluence that will induce a change in resistance of 1 Ω and thus
is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the DiMO surface conductivity to the AO flux.
Parameter A was found to be equal to 1.2×1014 O-atoms·cm-2∙Ω-1 and 8.7×1015 O-atoms∙cm-2∙Ω-1
for the 6 nm and 20 nm WO3-coated samples, respectively. Parameter B represents a baseline AO
fluence to be subtracted due to the initial resistance of the unexposed DiMO sensor and the
resistance of the contacts. Parameter B was found to be equal to 2.7×1018 O-atoms∙cm-2 and
1.28×1020 O-atoms∙cm-2 for the 6 nm and 20 nm WO3-coated samples, respectively. These results
indicate that the AO fluence saturation level and the calibration parameters A and B depend on the
thickness of the WO3 coating layer. Most notable is parameter A, which is inversely proportional
to the sensitivity of the sensor and increases as the WO3 thickness is increased.
At the next stage, we examined the effect of a variable AO flux on the conductivity of the
WO3-coated diamond surface. For this purpose, another 20 nm WO3-coated diamond was exposed
to RF oxygen plasma while the oxygen gas flow was gradually decreased during the exposure in
order to cause the change in the AO flux. The gas flow was changed slowly in the first phase of
experiment, but after 5 hours, the gas flow was gradually reduced to 0 SCCM, resulting in a
reduction of flux as the oxygen in the system is slowly depleted. The DiMO resistance

measurement was converted into AO fluence using the linear calibration function, according to the
Eq. (2), with parameters A and B measured for the similar 20 nm WO3 coated DiMO in the previous
exposure. The fluence detected by DiMO was then compared to the fluence detected by the QCM,
as shown in Figure 10(a). As seen in this figure, the DiMO-detected AO fluence is in a good
agreement with the AO fluence-detected by the QCM. Furthermore, the AO flux was calculated
by differentiating the measured fluence with respect to time for both detectors, DiMO and QCM.
AO flux values were plotted on the same graph, as shown in Figure 10(b). The results clearly show
that the QCM and DiMO flux measurements are in a good agreement, indicating that the DiMO

at a fluence of approximately 9×1019 O-atom∙cm-2 using 20 nm WO3-coated sensor. This value can
be considered low for typical LEO missions. Nevertheless, it is well-known that RF oxygen plasma
produces significantly more severe exposure conditions compared to the LEO space environment,
mostly due to the presence of oxygen ions and charged molecular species 47, 49. These charged
oxygen species carry a kinetic energy that can reach as high as 278 eV in RF plasma-based system
57

while the kinetic energy of AO impact on the spacecraft in LEO is substantially lower, about ~

4.5 eV 2. Furthermore, the plasma species are also much more reactive than neutral ground state
O(3P) AO in LEO. Therefore, in order to examine the effect of the true hyperthermal AO on the
electronic properties of the TMO diamond interface, further exposure experiments were performed
using a laser detonation AO source capable of producing hyperthermal O(3P) atoms.
3.4 DiMO exposure in laser detonation AO source
Two DiMO samples, coated by 10 nm and 30 nm thick layers of WO3, were exposed to a
pulsed beam of oxygen atoms with an average translational energy of ~4.7 eV and an average flux
of 4.4  1015 O-atoms∙cm-2∙s-1 using the laser detonation AO source schematically shown in Figure
5(a). The WO3 coating thickness in the range of 10 nm to 30 nm was chosen in order to obtain
higher saturation limit while preserving good linearity, based on the resistance change of the 20
nm coated DiMO sample during the RF oxygen plasma exposure. As shown in Figure 6, the
samples were mounted on the edge of the sample holder to ensure maximum exposure to the AO
beam, which expands around the chamber’s center axis, as seen in Figure 5(a).
The results of the resistance measurements, taken during the exposure for both the 10 nm
and 30 nm WO3-coated diamond samples, were plotted as a function of the AO fluence, as seen in
Figure 11. The measured resistance shows an abrupt increase which settles into a linear response

for the 10 nm sample and a near linear response for the 30 nm coated sample. Neither sample
reached saturation up to an accumulated AO fluence of 2×1020 O-atoms∙cm-2. These results
indicate a significantly higher DiMO lifetime in similar-to-LEO conditions with hyperthermal AO
compared with that obtained in RF plasma-based exposure experiments.

and 2.7×1016 O-atoms∙cm-2·Ω-1 for the 10 nm and 30 nm WO3-coated diamonds, respectively.

4. Discussion
The results of DiMO sensor exposure to ozone, and to oxygen atoms produced by RF
oxygen plasma and a laser detonation AO source show that it is possible to detect AO flux in realtime and with good accuracy while supplying low currents of 20 µA resulting in a low power
26

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qh9rh ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8219-9134 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

consumption ranging from 1µW to 100 µW, depending on DiMO resistance. Furthermore, the
obtained results indicate that both the DiMO sensor lifetime (AO fluence saturation level) and
detection sensitivity depend strongly on the thickness of the TMO coating layer. Exposure of
MoO3-coated DiMO to ozone showed that diamond substrates with TMO coating thickness values
lower than 2.8 nm reduced their charge carrier concentration and sheet conductance upon exposure
by two orders of magnitude after ~50 hours, reaching saturation at the end of 180-hour exposure.
In contrast, a DiMO coated with 3.8 nm MoO3 showed a much slower reduction in conductivity
and did not reach saturation after the 180-hour exposure. Moreover, DiMO exposure to RF oxygen
plasma and to a laser detonation AO source also indicate that the accumulated fluence saturation
level and the calibration parameters, A and B, depend on the thickness of the WO3 coating layer.
Parameter A, which is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of diamond surface conductivity to
AO, increases with the increased thickness of WO3, as shown in Figure 12(a). In other words, the
sensitivity of the DiMO sensor to the impinging AO flux is higher as the TMO coating gets thinner,
as depicted in Figure 12(b). Therefore, DiMO sensor fabricated using thinner TMO layer is
expected to have higher detection sensitivity to AO. On the other hand, RF oxygen plasma
exposure results show a fluence detection saturation value of 3.4×1018 O-atoms∙cm-2 for the 6 nm
WO3-coated DiMO, roughly 26 times lower than that detected for the 20 nm WO3-coated DiMO,
9×1019 O-atoms∙cm-2. Hence, similarly to the ozone exposure results, DiMO coating thickness is
proportional to the detection lifetime.

oxygen plasma exposure experiments (black squares) and the hyperthermal AO exposure
experiments (red circles). (b) Plot of the reaction sensitivity (depicted by 1/A), as a function of
WO3 coating thickness as extracted from the RF oxygen plasma exposure experiments (black

This effect can be related to the fact that the coating thickness determines the rate at which
the AO affects the diamond-TMO interface. The diamond conductivity depends on charge transfer
from the diamond surface to the WO3 coating layer 33. Hence, it is mainly affected by the electronic
state at the diamond-TMO interface. Therefore, the onset of conductivity change happens when
oxygen atoms reach this interface. The interaction of oxygen with various TMOs and its effect on
TMO’s electronic properties have been studied extensively and shown to involve different
processes such as adsorption, oxygen exchange, charge exchange, O2 formation and desorption,
O-vacancy creation, thermal and field induced diffusion, interaction with residual moisture, and
more 39-41. The oxygen initially affects the top layer of the TMO and then gradually begins to

28

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qh9rh ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8219-9134 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

impact the TMO structure and electronic properties at the interface with the diamond as it
propagates through the coating via various diffusion and exchange processes. Once the maximum
amounts of AO, O-vacancies, and charge reach the interface layer, the TMO work function — and,
consequently, the conductivity of the diamond — will be reduced to their minimum values.
This effect can be seen in the ozone exposure results which correspond well with the
reported data on oxygen exchange and diffusion in AO-exposed TMOs, where AO rapidly reaches
a depth of 1 nm to 2.5 nm, irrelevant of the oxide structure 41. Hence, during the exposure of both
the 1.5 nm and 2.8 nm MoO3-coated samples, the entire layer was affected within the exposure
time, including the TMO-diamond interface, and the maximum reduction in conductivity was
achieved. However, during the exposure of the 3.8 nm coated sample, the TMO-diamond interface
area was not entirely affected, allowing for a much slower change to its electrical properties and,
therefore, to a slower change in the TD-induced diamond conductivity. Thus, a thinner coating
will reduce time to onset of conductivity change, it will make the detector more sensitive to lower
AO fluxes and will cause the detector to reach saturation at a lower accumulated fluence. In
contrast, use of a thicker TMO layer enables the detection of higher AO fluence, albeit with
reduced detection sensitivity.
A rough assessment of the DiMO lifetime as a function of coating thickness can be made
assuming a simple diffusion process, e.g. a constant exposure to specific concentration of AO and
a diffusion coefficient of 5.5×10-22 m2∙s-1 for AO in TMO, which is the lowest value of the AO
diffusion coefficient measured for MoO3 and ZrO2 thin films 41. The ratio of the AO concentration
reaching the TMO-diamond interface area to the concentration of AO at the exposed TMO surface
was calculated as a function of time for different TMO coating thicknesses, using the simple
solution to diffusion equation in the form of Eq (3).

Note that this simple calculation is for thermal AO and does not include changes in Ovacancy concentrations, charge accumulation and various additional processes that can affect
electronic properties of the TMO-diamond interface. Nevertheless, the calculation results show the
increase in expected DiMO lifetime for thicker TMO coating thicknesses. The plots in Figure 13
show that DiMO devices lifetime increases gradually from less than 10 days of exposure for 1 nm
thick coatings to more than 100 days of exposure for 30 nm thick coatings, allowing the detection
of higher AO fluences. Thus, the TMO coating thickness can be tailored for specific requirements,
trading detection sensitivity for high saturation level required for longer detection lifetime.
In order to use DiMO sensor as an effective AO measurement tool, further research and
development are required. As seen by the analysis of the various exposure results, the TMO layer
properties are the key for enabling AO detection using DiMO. However, as discussed, this layer
is also susceptible to atmospheric O2 and moisture 40. The effect of O2 is expected to be relatively
small; the oxygen diffusion coefficient calculated for TMO (ZrO2) exposed to O2 was found to be
in the range of 10-30 m2∙s-1, roughly 8 orders of magnitude lower than that found for AO, indicating
a much slower degradation process 58. Nevertheless, an appropriate temporary encapsulation layer
should be developed and implemented in order to prevent degradation during storage in a similar
manner as to other diamond-based electronic devices 31. This thin protective layer should be
composed of a material that is impermeable to O2 and moisture, but unlike the encapsulating layer
in other diamond electronic device, is sufficiently susceptible to AO erosion. This is required in
order to allow the encapsulating layer to be rapidly and completely eroded when exposed to AO
in the LEO environment, exposing the TMO layer and allowing AO detection to begin. Several
candidate polymers such as BMI, are considered and they will be tested as encapsulating layer in
future studies. Moreover, the TD-induced conductivity in diamond is known to be relatively stable

31

at temperatures below 200 °C 31; however the temperatures DiMO might be exposed to in LEO
and VLEO missions may exceed this value. In order to maintain a constant TD-induced
conductivity in diamond at higher temperatures, various thermal stabilization and control methods
will be tested. Furthermore, TMOs are capable of regenerating their work function through
annealing in air 42. This ability can potentially increase DiMO detection lifetime and make DiMO
detectors serve as fully recyclable devices for AO detection in ground-based systems. The ability
of the DiMO sensor to regenerate its original pre-exposed conductivity through annealing will be
tested in future studies.

4. Conclusions
A novel AO sensor based on the electronic properties of a diamond surface coated with a
thin layer of TMO, denoted as DiMO, is presented. The DiMO sensor is a simple, small in size (a
few millimeters), solid-state device with very low power consumption of less than 0.1 mW, as was
demonstrated by ground-based AO exposure experiments.
The sensor performance was tested both in RF oxygen plasma and in a laser detonation AO
source. A linear correlation between the diamond surface resistance and the AO fluence for a
diamond device coated with 6 − 30 nm thick WO3 was observed. In addition, exposure to
hyperthermal AO shows that the device is capable of measuring fluences in excess of 2×1020 Oatoms∙cm-2. Furthermore, the electrical resistance sensitivity to AO was found to be tunable in the
range of 10-14 – 10-15 Ω∙O-atoms-1∙cm2, inversely dependent on the coating thickness. At the same
time, the fluence in which the device resistance reaches saturation was also found to be directly

dependent on TMO coating thickness. Hence, by changing the TMO coating thickness the device
could be tailored for specific requirements, trading detection sensitivity for longer sensor lifetime.
The presented work demonstrates the ability of a novel actinometer based on DiMO
technology to be used effectively as a tunable AO sensor, capable of measuring a wide range of
AO fluxes in real time. With the increased interest in both low-cost “new space” applications and
VLEO missions, DiMO AO detectors can serve as an affordable and simple solution in both
spacecraft and ground-based AO simulation systems.
