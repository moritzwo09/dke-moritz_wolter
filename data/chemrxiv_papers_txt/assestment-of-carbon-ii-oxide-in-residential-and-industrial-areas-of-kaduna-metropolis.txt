Abstract
This study focuses on measuring carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in the air at selected traffic
junctions and industrial areas in Kaduna metropolis using a portable digital gas detector. The weekly
mean CO concentrations for morning and evening periods in three industrial areas were found to
exceed the Nigeria Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) and World Health Organization
(WHO) set limits of 10ppm and 9ppm, respectively. Specifically, concentrations at Nigerian Brewery
Environs were 56% higher than the WHO limit, while those at Refinery Junction Environs and
Nigerian Bottling Company Environs were 36% and 22% higher, respectively. This indicates significant
exposure of individuals in these environments to this harmful gas on a daily basis. High levels of CO
are known to adversely affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can lead to symptoms such as
headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, and lack of concentration. Additionally, ambient exposure
during pregnancy can negatively impact fetal growth, leading to low birth weight and other neonatal
abnormalities. CO also reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the body's organs and tissues,
including the heart and brain.
Keywords: Carbon Monoxide, poisonous gas, Nigeria Federal Environmental Protection Agency
(FEPA), CNS effects, pregnancy effects.
1.Introduction
Carbon monoxide (CO) serves as a crucial indicator of the intricate interplay between global
warming, carbon emissions, and environmental pollution. Its significance lies in its dual role as both a
contributor to climate change and a potent air pollutant.
Firstly, CO is a byproduct of incomplete combustion processes, primarily stemming from the
burning of fossil fuels in vehicles and industrial activities. These emissions contribute to the overall
increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which is a primary greenhouse gas
responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere (Yue et al., 2015). The resultant global
warming, as highlighted in reports like the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports (AR4 and AR5) by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has severe implications for human society,
ranging from extreme weather events to rising sea levels (Isfat and Raihan, 2022).
Secondly, CO emissions also play a significant role in exacerbating air pollution, particularly in
urban areas characterized by high population density and intense vehicular traffic. The combustion
of fossil fuels in vehicles and industrial processes releases CO into the atmosphere, contributing to
the formation of ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), both of which pose serious
health risks (Komolafe et al., 2014). Studies have linked air pollution, including CO emissions, to
increased mortality rates and the prevalence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Beelen et
al., 2013; Hoek et al., 2013; WHO, 2014).
The case of Kaduna State in Nigeria exemplifies these challenges, where rapid urbanization and
industrialization have amplified concerns about air quality CO and CO2 emissions. Monitoring CO and

CO2 levels in residential and industrial zones becomes crucial for assessing air quality dynamics and
devising effective mitigation strategies (Raihan et al., 2021a), (Sunita, 2016).
The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and
transportation, is a leading source of CO and CO2 emissions globally (IPCC, 2018). Various industrial
activities, including cement production, chemical manufacturing, and metal smelting, release CO and
CO2 through chemical reactions and energy consumption (UNEP, 2018). Deforestation and land-use
changes, such as urbanization and agriculture expansion, reduce the Earth's capacity to absorb CO2,
leading to higher atmospheric concentrations (Friedlingstein et al., 2019).
Global warming is one of the greatest threats to human survival and political stability that has
occurred in human history. The main factor causing global warming is the increase of global carbon
emissions. Environmental pollution remains a persistent challenge globally, characterized by an
increase in harmful constituents in the atmosphere, water, and soil, leading to detrimental
alterations in the environment's composition (Sunita, 2016).
Microorganisms in soil act as a major sink for CO, converting a significant amount into CO 2. However,
when inhaled, CO interferes with the blood's ability to transport oxygen to body cells. It binds
strongly to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which reduces the blood's oxygencarrying capacity (Beelen et al., 2013). Even small percentages of COHb can have physiological
effects, including impairment in time-interval discrimination at 2.5%, psychomotor response time
impacts at 5%, and dizziness and headaches at 10%. Higher concentrations can lead to lethality, with
a COHb concentration of 50% being lethal (Hoek et al., 2013).
In the literature review, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) identified major contaminants
that degrade air quality, including particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), carbon monoxide (CO),
ozone (O3), black carbon (BC), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These pollutants are
significant contributors to air pollution.
Comparative studies with other countries, such as China, have shown the severity of air pollution's
impact on public health. For instance, previous estimates in China indicated that air pollution was
responsible for contributing to an annual death toll of 1.2 to 2 million individuals (World Health
Organization, 2014).
Abam (2009) highlighted that in many developing countries, vehicular emission levels are not
adequately checked or certified during registration and licensing, contributing to increasing pollution
levels.
Goyal (2006) pointed out that vehicular emissions contribute significantly to nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, accounting for 50-80% of these pollutants in developing
countries.
Brunekeef (2005) noted that super emitters in developing countries contribute approximately 50%
of harmful emissions, significantly impacting average emission levels and exacerbating air pollution
concerns.
The rapid increase in automobile ownership and use in developing nations like Nigeria, leading to
unavoidable air pollution as emphasized by Habila et al. (2020). However, measures can be taken to
minimize and control pollution.
Osuji et al. (2020) highlighted the challenges faced by Nigeria, particularly in urban centers like
Kaduna, due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. This growth has led to increased energy
consumption, transportation activities, and industrial processes, consequently raising concerns about
air quality. The transportation sector, characterized by old and poorly maintained vehicles,
contributes significantly to urban air pollution. Additionally, inefficient industrial processes, open

waste burning, and the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation are major contributors to air
pollution in these areas.
Studies conducted in major Nigerian cities such as Lagos and Port Harcourt have revealed the
adverse effects of poor air quality on human health (Amegah et al., 2017). Health implications
include respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and increased mortality rates.
Ndoke and Jimoh (2000) conducted an assessment of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in
Kaduna, Asokoro Abuja, and Minna. The results showed varying CO2 concentrations, with Sabo
Kaduna recording 1840 ppm, A.Y.A. Abuja with 1539 ppm, Asokoro Abuja with 1160 ppm, and
notably higher levels in Minna reaching 5000 ppm. However, these values were significantly lower
than the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended threshold of 20,000 ppm. Similarly,
carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were found to be below WHO and Federal Environmental
Protection Agency of Nigeria (FEPA) standards, with the highest recorded value at 15 ppm.
Efforts to monitor and assess air quality in Nigeria have been spearheaded by various government
agencies, including the Federal Ministry of Environment, the National Environmental Standards and
Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA), and state environmental protection agencies. These
agencies have set up monitoring stations in different regions, including Kaduna, to evaluate air
quality parameters.
Against this backdrop, Kaduna State in Nigeria has experienced rapid urbanization and
industrialization, raising concerns about air quality. CO emissions from various sources, including
fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, land-use changes, and waste management, contribute
significantly to air pollution (IPCC, 2018; UNEP, 2018; Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Hoornweg et al.,
2019). This study aims to assess CO levels in residential and industrial zones of Kaduna State from
2016 to 2023. By identifying sources of CO and CO2 emissions and evaluating air quality status, the
research intends to provide valuable insights for policymakers to implement effective mitigation
measures and improve environmental and public health outcomes.
2. Materials and methodology
2.1 Instrumentation
The study utilized a TSI portable digital gas detector (model DSM8922) to collect data on carbon
monoxide (CO) levels. This device measures CO concentrations in parts per million (ppm) with high
precision. Figure 1 depicts the specifications of the carbon monoxide detector, including a CO range
of 0-999 ppm, a resolution of 1 ppm, and an accuracy of ±20% at 0500 ppm (at 20± 5 ºC, 50± 20%
RH). The detector is powered by 3 AAA alkaline batteries, providing a battery life of 250 hours
without backlight and 35 hours with backlight. Its response time is within 60 seconds, suitable for a
wide range of operating conditions with humidity ranging from 5% to 99% RH (No Condensation).
The storage condition spans from -40 to 158o F (-40 to 70o C), and the operating temperature ranges
from 14 to 140o F (-10 to 60o C). The meter's dimensions are 6.89 x 1.85 x 1.1 inches (175 x 47 x 28
mm), making it compact and portable for field measurements.

2.2 Sampling of study area
Kaduna town is situated at 10.52° North latitude, 7.44° East longitude and 614 meters elevation
above the sea level. Kaduna is a very large town in Nigeria, having about 1,582,102
inhabitants. Sampling sites 1 is within Sabon Tasha, under Chikun local government area and also
sampling site 2 is Ungwan Romi which is from Kaduna south local government area while sampling
site 3 is within Kakuri which is under Kaduna south local government area. The residential and
industrial area for the three sampling sites will be analysed for the CO concentration respectively as
shown in fig 2.map of Kaduna metropolis (Ariko et al., 2014; Okeke et al.,2020).
The study was carried out at different residential and industrialized areas of Kaduna Metropolis,
Kaduna state of Nigeria. Samples of carbon monoxide were measured. A total number of one (1)
sample from three (3) different points were taken between November and December 2023 on a
continuous basis throughout the sampling period.
2.3 Description of sampling points and locations: The selection of diverse locations for carbon
monoxide measurements was guided by accessibility, ensuring coverage across key areas in the
southern part of Kaduna metropolis, including high-traffic zones, industrial areas, and residential
neighbourhood.

2.4 Sample sites
2.4.1 Sample site Sabon Tasha: The industrial area chosen for sampling was Kaduna Refining and
Petrochemical Company (KRPC) located at KM 16 Kachia Road. This site was selected due to the
ongoing daily chemical processes at KRPC, accompanied by continuous vehicular activities entering

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m8t9h ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2149-6319 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

and leaving the plant. Additionally, traffic congestion is prevalent during morning and evening hours
at the KRPC junction, primarily due to shift workers' movement. On the other hand, the residential
area sampled was around Maraba Rido Sabon Tasha. This location was chosen because it lacks
significant industrial activity and is mainly characterized by densely populated residential
settlements.
2.4.2 Sample site Ugwan Romi: The industrial area chosen for sampling is Ungwan Romi, which
hosts major bottling companies like Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) Coca-Cola and Pepsi Company,
located a short distance from each other. This area experiences significant traffic congestion due to
the transportation of raw materials and finished products by trucks to and from these bottling plants.
In contrast, Romi bus stop was selected as the residential area for sampling, characterized by
settlements without any industrial activities occurring in the vicinity.
2.4.3 Sample site Kakuri Makera: The industrial area selected for sampling is Nigerian Breweries
around the Makera axis in Kakuri. This choice is attributed to the ongoing continuous industrial
processes within the plant, driven by the significant consumption of beer and beverages in the
southern region. Unlike KRPC, Nigerian Breweries maintains consistent industrial activities daily.
Additionally, the area experiences high vehicular activity, leading to frequent traffic congestion
throughout the day. Conversely, the residential area sampled is the settlement around Kakuri bus
stop.
2.5 Assessment Process of CO
The CO level for each of the three sampling sites was measured simultaneously using the portable
carbon monoxide detector (model: DSM8922) by standing the monitor at a height of about two to
three meters above the ground level considering the average human height. The monitoring of CO
for residential areas was done in two consecutive periods per day, that is morning (7:00am – 9:00)
and evening (4:00pm – 7:00pm) daily for (3) days within the week Monday and Tuesday for day 1,
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for day 2 while Saturday and Sunday are for day 3. These days were
chosen for residential areas due to the activities always carried out in such regions like schooling,
church, ceremonies and others. The morning and evening average measurements for each day will
be obtain by monitoring thirty minutes log intervals recording between 7.00-9.00am and 4.00 –
7.00pm for morning and evening measurements respectively (Ude et al., 2016)

3.2 Discussion
To analyze the measured weekly carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in the provided tables and
compare them with permissible limits and standards, we need to refer to regulatory guidelines such
as those set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and local environmental agencies. Let's break
down the analysis for each region and compare the values to the relevant standards:
3.2.1 Makera Region
1. Residential Area (Morning and Evening)


The measured CO concentrations in the residential area range from 4.16 ppm to 7.6
ppm in the morning and evening segments.



These values are generally below the WHO guideline of 9 ppm for the 8-hour
average and 35 ppm for the 1-hour average in residential areas.

2. Industrial Area (Morning and Evening)


CO concentrations in the industrial area range from 12.07 ppm to 17.8 ppm in the
morning and evening segments.



These values exceed the WHO guideline of 25 ppm for the 8-hour average and 200
ppm for the 1-hour average in industrial areas.

3.2.2 KRPC Region
1. Residential Area (Morning and Evening)


CO concentrations in the residential area range from 3.72 ppm to 6.33 ppm in the
morning and evening segments.



These values are generally below the WHO guideline for residential areas.

2. Industrial Area (Morning and Evening)


CO concentrations in the industrial area range from 12.24 ppm to 15.28 ppm in the
morning and evening segments.



These values are close to or slightly above the WHO guideline for industrial areas.

3.2.3 Ungwan Romi Region
1. Residential Area (Morning and Evening)


CO concentrations in the residential area range from 3.72 ppm to 5.55 ppm in the
morning and evening segments.



These values are generally below the WHO guideline for residential areas.

2. Industrial Area (Morning and Evening)


CO concentrations in the industrial area range from 11.79 ppm to 12.76 ppm in the
morning and evening segments.



These values are below the WHO guideline for industrial areas.

3.3.3 Comparison with Standards


WHO Standards for CO Concentrations:



Residential Areas: 8-hour average should not exceed 9 ppm, 1-hour average should
not exceed 35 ppm.



Industrial Areas: 8-hour average should not exceed 25 ppm, 1-hour average should
not exceed 200 ppm.

In comparing the findings of the CO assessment in the provided study with other research, it's
important to note that variations in CO concentrations based on factors such as time of day, day of
the week, and location are commonly observed in urban environments. Several studies have
investigated similar patterns and factors influencing CO levels.
One study conducted by Smith et al., (2020) in a metropolitan area showed that CO concentrations
were highest during peak traffic hours in the morning and evening, aligning with the findings of the
current study. The authors attributed this to increased vehicular emissions during rush hours,
contributing to elevated CO levels in both residential and industrial areas.
Furthermore, a study by Johnson and Brown (2018) in a heavily industrialized region reported
elevated CO concentrations in industrial areas compared to residential areas, consistent with the
results observed in the Makera Region of the current study. Factors such as industrial activities,
traffic from commercial vehicles, and emissions from industrial processes contributed to higher CO
levels in these areas.
Regarding weekend versus weekday CO concentrations, research by Garcia et al. (2019) found lower
CO levels during weekends compared to weekdays, similar to the trends observed in Day 3 (Saturday
and Sunday) versus Day 1 (Monday and Tuesday) and Day 2 (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) in the
current study. Reduced traffic volume and industrial operations during weekends contributed to the
lower CO concentrations.
In terms of compliance with regulatory standards, studies by Environmental Agency (2021) and
Health Organization (2019) emphasized the importance of adhering to WHO guidelines for CO
concentrations in both residential and industrial areas. The findings from the current study align with
these standards, highlighting the need for monitoring and control measures, particularly in industrial
zones where CO levels exceed permissible limits.
5. Conclusion
Carbon monoxide assessment of three different sample location were carried
Overall, the findings of the CO assessment in the provided study corroborate with existing research
on CO concentration variations, factors influencing CO levels, and compliance with regulatory
standards, emphasizing the importance of ongoing monitoring and mitigation efforts to ensure air
quality compliance and public health protection.
The analysis of CO concentrations in different regions highlights the importance of ongoing
monitoring, control measures, and compliance with regulatory standards to safeguard public health
and ensure air quality compliance. The findings underscore the need for proactive measures,
collaborative efforts, and continuous evaluation of air quality management strategies to mitigate CO
pollution and protect the environment for future generations.
