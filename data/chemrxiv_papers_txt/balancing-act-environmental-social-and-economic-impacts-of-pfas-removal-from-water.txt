Abstract

27

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging water contaminants with significant

28

environmental and health impacts, posing challenges in water treatment due to their

29

degradation resistance. This study reviews 10 papers on the sustainability of technologies for

30

PFAS removal, revealing a critical literature gap as regulations emerge. Our review shows

31

sustainability varies across technologies and contexts. Specifically, single-use ion exchange (IX)

32

demonstrates cost-effectiveness and environmental favorability for long-chain PFAS removal

33

from groundwater and aqueous film-forming foam impacted water, while granular activated

34

carbon (GAC) appears costlier due to rapid breakthroughs. These limited findings underscore

35

the need for more comprehensive research to validate results across contexts and understand

36

the full sustainability profile of PFAS treatment technologies, including removal and destruction.

37

Current literature often overlooks key considerations like the ultimate fate of PFAS. To address

38

these gaps, we propose a framework for future sustainability studies, enabling clearer

39

technology evaluations under specific conditions. While IX shows broad applicability, treatment

40

choice should consider water type, system boundary, functional unit, PFAS concentration, and

41

ultimate fate of PFAS for a more holistic view of sustainability.

1.0 Introduction.

46

Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a group of persistent organic

47

pollutants characterized by strong and stable chemical bonds between carbon and fluorine

48

atoms.1–5 These substances exhibit remarkable resistance to environmental degradation due to

49

their robust chemical structure, and lack of evolutionary pressure which renders them resistant

50

to heat, alkali, and acid.6 Consequently, PFAS have found widespread use in various industrial

51

applications, including non-stick cookware,7 food packaging,2,8,9 aqueous film-forming foam,9

52

plastics,10 and semiconductor manufacturing.11,12 Since the 1940s,7 the discharge of PFAS from

53

commercial and industrial sources has led to their widespread presence in water sources

54

worldwide, with concentrations ranging from ng/L to sometimes μg/L levels.2,4 PFAS

55

contamination has been detected in various water sources, including drinking water,

56

groundwater, surface water, tap water, and industrial effluents, prompting the establishment of

57

environmental quality standards, and guidelines in many countries.2,13–15 Recognized as

58

emerging contaminants, some classes of PFAS, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and

59

perfluorooctane sulfonate acid (PFOS), pose significant health and environmental risks due to

60

their carcinogenic properties.16–21 However, the environmental persistence and bioaccumulative

61

nature of all PFAS make them worrisome for future generations, as these chemicals do not

62

readily degrade and can accumulate in the environment over time. To address this global

63

challenge, numerous organizations have taken regulatory measures. For instance, the

64

Stockholm Convention designated PFOS, and PFOA as persistent organic pollutants in 2009,

65

and 2019, respectively.22,23 The European Commission has outlined its chemicals strategy,

66

which includes plans to phase out non-essential uses of PFAS within the EU.24,25 The

67

International Chemicals Management has identified PFAS as a priority issue. In 2016, the US

68

EPA established a drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng/L for the combined

69

concentrations of PFOA and PFOS.26 The US EPA recently established the first-ever national

70

drinking water standard for PFAS, which will go into effect with mandatory monitoring by 2027

71

and compliance by 2029, with specific maximum contaminant levels for PFOA, and PFOS at 4.0

72

parts per trillion.27 As a result of these regulations, researchers worldwide are actively seeking

73

effective treatment techniques to remove PFAS from water sources.

74

The predominant focus of recent research lies in investigating the efficacy of various

75

technologies for removing PFAS, encompassing adsorption, membrane filtration, destructive

76

processes, and other methodologies. Among these, ion exchange (IX)28–31, and granular

77

activated carbon (GAC)32–34 are the most prevalent adsorption techniques employed for PFAS

78

removal. However, due to environmental concerns about water contamination and resource

79

depletion, considerable attention has been directed toward the regeneration, reuse, and

80

disposal aspects associated with IX and GAC.35–39 Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have

81

emerged as leading membrane technologies for PFAS removal because of their high removal

82

efficiencies.40–43 However, their implementation is constrained to specific contexts due to the

83

need for pretreatment measures, high operating cost, and energy demand.44,45 Beyond these

84

conventional approaches, a range of alternative technologies such as oxidation,46 activated

85

persulfate oxidation,47 electrochemical advanced oxidation process,48 plasma,49 and foam

86

fractionation50 have been explored for PFAS treatment from water sources. Driven by the

87

urgency to address environmental PFAS contamination, research has primarily focused on

88

determining the efficacy of these technologies, with little attention given to assessing their

89

sustainability.

90

Sustainability, encompassing economic, environmental, and social impacts, is a

91

paramount consideration in PFAS treatment research.51 While meeting regulatory standards is

92

important, demonstrating financial viability and social impacts are crucial for industry and

93

community acceptance, respectively. For instance, the higher operational and capital expenses

94

associated with IX, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis in comparison to alternative technologies

95

like GAC make these technologies less applicable in industrial settings.52 Sustainability

96

facilitates the selection of treatment methods based on specific needs. The assessment of

97

environmental impacts through life cycle impact assessment (LCA), and financial feasibility

98

through techno-economic analysis (TEA) or life cycle cost analysis (LCCA), serve as prominent

99

methodologies indicating sustainability.53 Social impacts are usually assessed through social

100

sustainability evaluation matrix.54 For PFAS, most of the existing research has focused on

101

removal efficiencies using GAC and IX technologies, resulting in limited studies that

102

comprehensively address their economic, environmental, and social impacts. There exists a

103

substantial research gap regarding the sustainability of these technologies, and current

104

literature fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the overarching concept of

105

sustainability for PFAS treatment. Selecting the appropriate water treatment method requires

106

considering water types, usage, regulations, costs, and final PFAS fate which is essential for

107

informed decision-making via LCA and TEA. However, it is not clear which technologies are the

108

most sustainable across various contexts. Therefore, a comprehensive study is needed to

109

consolidate the literature on sustainability of PFAS treatment for effective decision-making.

110

This review will consolidate existing research on economic, environmental, and social

111

impacts of removing PFAS from various water sources using different water treatment

112

techniques. The main goals of this study are to clarify the current status, future directions, and

113

necessary actions for sustainable PFAS water treatment. The two major specific objectives are

114

(1) to understand how and to what extent previous literature has evaluated sustainability of

115

PFAS treatment technologies and (2) to develop a potential conceptual framework for

116

characterizing the sustainability of PFAS treatment technologies. This review consolidated

117

literature on evaluating the sustainability of PFAS-contaminated water treatment. From a

118

screening of 278 articles, only 10 studies were identified as relevant to the goals of this study.

119

Information on environmental sustainability, financial viability, and social impacts was extracted

120

and consolidated from these articles to find out the most sustainable treatment technology for

121

different scenarios. Next, a systematic framework was developed for future researchers to guide

122

the selection of sustainable PFAS treatment technologies. This study will provide important

123

insights into sustainability, offering decision-makers a valuable resource for identifying the

124

sustainable and economically viable PFAS treatment technology from water sources.

125

2.0 Functional Unit to Standardize Sustainability indicators.

126

Studying sustainability for PFAS treatment from water requires a focus on several key

127

components, such as the functional unit, system boundary, water type, and methodological

128

approaches. These components are essential for assessing the environmental sustainability,

129

social impacts, and financial feasibility of various treatment technologies (Figure 1). By

130

standardizing sustainability indicators through these key components, researchers can develop

131

more robust and comparable assessments, ultimately advancing the field of PFAS treatment

132

and contributing to the broader goal of sustainable water management. Figure 1 illustrates the

133

research focus and gaps in the current body of literature. The thickness of each line represents

134

the number of reviewed papers, highlighting areas where research is concentrated and where

135

further investigation is needed. This visual representation aids in identifying trends, emerging

136

technologies, and underexplored areas, guiding future research efforts towards a more

137

comprehensive understanding of PFAS treatment sustainability. Details on how the literature

138

review was systematically conducted are included in the Supporting Information (SI) Section S1,

139

and Table S1 has all the information used in the development of Figure 1.

140

2.1 Functional Unit and System Boundary.

141

Functional unit is a standardized measure used in various sustainability analyses to

142

compare indicators across different technologies, systems, or processes. This measurement is

143

crucial for comparisons on an equivalent basis, ensuring results are based on consistent

144

performance metrics. In the context of sustainability of PFAS treatment, various functional units

145

were identified across the literature, including the mass of PFAS55,56 and mass of sludge57.

146

However, Figure 1 shows a predominant emphasis on the unit volume of water. Regional and

147

global differences in domestic water consumption, influenced by climate, infrastructure, and

148

societal factors, highlight the challenges of establishing a standardized functional unit. The

149

majority of examined papers opted for a functional unit based on the volume of water, with 70%

150

of the sampled literature employing 1 m3 of treated water as the standard.56,58–63 Notably, one

151

paper deviated from this trend, utilizing 800,000 gallons of groundwater per day as its functional

152

unit.53 The chosen functional unit corresponds to the actual daily water consumption of

153

Brighton's population, estimated at approximately 8000 people with an average daily

154

consumption of 100 gallons per capita per day. Landfill leachate is a major source of PFAS in

155

the environment. It is usually transported to wastewater treatment plants and treated with

156

municipal wastewater. Therefore, this review also examines the sustainability of leachate

157

treatment for PFAS removal. The importance of selecting a functional unit is highlighted in

158

sustainability assessments of leachate treatment. When “1 g of PFAS removed” is used as the

159

functional unit, the assessment reveals higher environmental and human health impacts

160

compared to using “1 m³ of leachate treated” as the functional unit.56 Evaluation per mass of

161

PFAS removed is more relevant to human and environmental health, while evaluation per

162

volume of PFAS-impacted water treatment is more relevant to costs and engineering. This

163

demonstrates that the choice of a functional unit significantly influences the overall sustainability

164

outcomes of PFAS treatment technologies. However, the water treatment industry operates

165

based on the volume of water treated, and associated costs are typically calculated per unit

166

volume. Therefore, most of the reviewed papers have utilized water volume as the functional

167

unit.

168

A system boundary in the context of sustainability assessments defines the limits of what

169

is included and excluded in the analysis of a system, product, or process.64 It determines which

170

stages, processes, flows, and impacts are considered within the scope of the evaluation.65,66 For

171

PFAS treatment technologies, clearly defining these boundaries is essential to capture the

172

comprehensive environmental, economic, and social implications associated with each

173

technology. The persistent nature of PFAS necessitates a thorough consideration of the fate of

174

these substances across different treatment methods, yet current literature often overlooks this

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

175

aspect. Most of the existing studies have defined their system boundaries around the removal of

176

PFAS, with limited attention given to the ultimate destruction of these compounds (e.g.,

177

incineration58,59,61). This omission is significant, as the destruction phase can entail considerable

178

environmental, economic, and social costs that are not accounted for in current assessments.

179

To comprehensively evaluate the sustainability impacts of PFAS treatment technologies, future

180

research should expand system boundaries to include destruction technologies, such as

181

advanced oxidation processes,67 electrochemical oxidation,67,68 plasma,68 and others. This

182

broader perspective will provide a more holistic view of sustainability, enabling the accurate

183

assessment of the true sustainability implications of PFAS treatment technologies.

184

2.2 Water Type.

185

Water type selection is significant in sustainability studies, guiding the choices of

186

treatment technologies based on varying pollutant concentrations and characteristics of PFAS.

187

PFAS concentrations range from 20 to 20,000 ng/L in groundwater,69,70 11-23 ng/L in well

188

water,71 0.4-40 ng/L in drinking water,72,73 5.1 to 298,559 ng/L in landfill leachate,74 3-430 ng/L in

189

wastewater influent,75–82 and 6-500 ng/L in wastewater effluent77–79,81–84 systems across USA,

190

China, Europe, and Australia;85,86 PFAS composition was primarily represented by PFOA, PFOS

191

and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS). Groundwater has been predominantly researched

192

for PFAS treatment, driven by its prevalence, regulatory importance, ease of study, persistence,

193

and ecological impact (Figure 1).53,58–60,62 Fire extinguishing water, particularly from military and

194

industrial sites using aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), poses significant challenges for PFAS

195

treatment due to high PFAS concentrations. Fluorine-free alternatives have shown improved

196

biodegradability and reduced environmental persistence compared to AFFF.61,87 Nonetheless,

197

some alternatives may still present similar or higher environmental impacts.88,89 Additional

198

research is required to fully understand the sustainability of these alternative firefighting foams.

199

As the volume of landfilled solid waste continues to grow globally, the generation of leachate is

200

expected to increase correspondingly.90 Landfill leachate contains a complex mix of

201

contaminants, including PFAS.91,92 Its high variability in PFAS concentrations necessitates

202

robust, and adaptable treatment technologies. Studies should emphasize the requirement for

203

systems capable of handling this variability effectively. Drinking water is a critical area for PFAS

204

treatment due to its direct impact on public health. Recent EPA regulation for PFOA and PFOS

205

in drinking water aims to protect communities from the adverse impacts of PFAS including

206

cancer, and developmental impacts in children, and infants.93 Meeting the stringent levels of

207

PFOA and PFOS concentrations requires highly effective and sustainable treatment

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

208

technologies, which are still not adequately covered in current literature. Understanding the

209

specific challenges and opportunities of each water type allows for better tailoring of PFAS

210

treatment technologies to achieve sustainability in environmental, social, and financial terms.

211

This comprehensive approach ensures effective mitigation of PFAS contamination across

212

various water sources.

2.3 Indicator and Impact Assessment Method.

220

Assessing the sustainability of treatment technologies for PFAS removal from water

221

sources require a multifaceted approach. In this study, we reviewed existing literature to

222

examine how treatment technologies for PFAS are evaluated in terms of sustainability. We

223

focused on three key indicators commonly used in these studies: environmental sustainability,

224

social impacts, and financial viability. The reviewed studies employed various methodologies,

225

including LCA, LCCA, and TEA to quantify these indicators. Different impact assessment

226

methods were integrated into these evaluations to provide a comprehensive analysis of the

227

sustainability of PFAS treatment technologies. The assessment tools included TRACI,53,56,58–60,62

228

ReCipe,56,57,59 environmental footprint,61 Impact 2002+,55 social sustainability evaluation matrix,53

229

and net present value53,56,57,59,63. These tools have been utilized to assess any treatment

230

technologies environmental sustainability, social impacts, and financial viability values. The

231

selection of impact assessment methodology varies depending on the type of infrastructure and

232

the research objectives. This choice can significantly influence the results due to key differences

233

in how the environmental relevance of indicators is considered. In sustainability studies,

234

particularly in LCA, impact assessment methodologies are generally classified into two main

235

types: midpoint models and endpoint models. These models are used to evaluate the

236

environmental impacts of a system, product, or process at different stages and levels of detail.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

237

Midpoint models provide a greater level of certainty because they focus on specific impact

238

categories, such as carbon footprint, and water footprint, before they are aggregated. In

239

contrast, endpoint models consolidate information into a single score, making them more

240

understandable to decision-makers by summarizing the overall damage to human health,

241

ecosystems, and resources. Methods like TRACI, ReCiPe, and the environmental footprint can

242

serve as either midpoint or endpoint methodologies based on their application. For example,

243

when TRACI, ReCiPe, or environmental footprint are used to assess specific impact categories,

244

they function as midpoint indicators. Conversely, when they are applied to evaluate

245

comprehensive environmental damage, they align with endpoint methodologies. Integrating LCA

246

and TEA with tools like TRACI, ReCiPe, and environmental footprint ensures a detailed analysis

247

of environmental impacts. This integration provides a robust framework for assessing

248

sustainability by balancing detailed environmental data with broader impact evaluations.

249

Simultaneously, the social sustainability evaluation matrix and net present value offer valuable

250

insights into social and financial aspects, respectively. The choice of methodology should

251

ultimately reflect the research objectives. Selecting a method that can be supplemented with

252

additional assessments, such as health and social impacts, aligns research goals more closely

253

with the primary objectives of sustainability. Such a comprehensive approach not only helps

254

identify the sustainable technologies but also facilitates understanding the trade-offs between

255

different sustainability indicators. By balancing environmental, social, and financial

256

considerations, this integrated methodology supports informed decision-making and promotes a

257

holistic view of sustainability.

258

2.3.1 Environmental Sustainability.

259

Environmental sustainability has attracted the most attention among the three

260

sustainability indicators (Figure 1). In the majority of studies, TRACI and ReCiPe methodologies

261

have been commonly employed to evaluate the environmental sustainability of GAC and IX

262

technologies across various water types.53,56–60,62 However, environmental footprint was utilized

263

to assess the environmental impact of GAC in fire extinguishing water, while Impact 2002+ was

264

employed for subcritical water decomposition technology in subcritical water.55,61 LCA assesses

265

environmental impacts using both midpoint and endpoint indicators. Ozone depletion, global

266

warming, smog, acidification, eutrophication, carcinogenic, and non-carcinogenic effects,

267

respiratory effects, ecotoxicity, and fossil fuel depletion are included as midpoint indicators,

268

whereas human health, ecological quality, climate change, resources are part of the endpoint

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

269

indicators. Understanding these indicators helps to evaluate the varying impacts of GAC and IX

270

technologies.

271

Variations within GAC or IX technologies, such as single-use GAC adsorbents, single-

272

use IX resins as well as methods for reactivation and regeneration, each carry distinct

273

environmental implications and tradeoffs. The multitude of options available for selection

274

between these technologies significantly influences the results of LCAs. However, numerous

275

studies suggest that from an environmental sustainability standpoint, IX generally exhibits lower

276

environmental impacts compared to GAC.53,58,59,61,62 IX systems have lower media usage rates

277

(mass of adsorbent media required to treat a given volume of water) due to higher adsorption

278

capacity and longer bed life, leading to less frequent media replacement, and fewer

279

environmental impacts from production and disposal. For instance, single-use IX resins have

280

lower environmental impacts in all indicators except ozone depletion compared to regenerable

281

resins and GAC adsorbents.59 Further research supported these findings, showing lower overall

282

environmental impacts for IX when removing long-chained PFAS from groundwater.53 Another

283

study found that GAC generates higher average impacts, excluding ozone depletion, compared

284

to IX-based technologies at various PFAS concentrations.62 The high ozone depletion impacts

285

from single-use IX resins are due to the release of ozone-depleting chemicals during their

286

production. Despite these impacts, GAC has shown potential in specific treatment scenarios.

287

Although GAC is less environmentally friendly compared to IX, several studies have

288

identified GAC as a promising treatment technology, particularly for initial high contaminant

289

loads, low dissolved organic carbon, concentrations, longer-chained PFAS including, PFOA and

290

PFOS.40,53,62,94 Proper reactivation techniques can mitigate GAC's negative environmental

291

impacts. For instance, thermally reactivated GAC has been found to have lower impacts than

292

single-use GAC and even regenerable IX treatments.59 Utilizing off-site thermal reactivation and

293

reuse of spent GAC media significantly reduces impacts by decreasing the need for new

294

adsorbent material, and operating at lower temperatures (e.g., 815°C compared to 1200°C for

295

hazardous waste incinerators).59,95,96 Regeneration techniques for IX resins play a key role in its

296

environmental sustainability. Regenerable IX systems, while generally less impactful than

297

single-use GAC, can have significant environmental impacts due to the infrastructure and

298

chemical-intensive processes required for resin regeneration and regenerant recycling. The

299

environmental impacts of IX resins regeneration could be reduced by recycling methanol and/or

300

brine, thereby, decreasing the amount of waste sent to incineration. However, altering the

301

composition of the regeneration solution requires careful consideration as replacing NaCl with

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

302

alternative salts can increase environmental impacts.58 Another study showed that the

303

regeneration and reuse of IX resins with electrochemical oxidation in groundwater significantly

304

reduces global warming potential (GWP), especially when the energy efficiency of oxidation is

305

between 192 kWh/m³ and 656 kWh/m³. Regeneration and reuse of IX resins coupling with

306

electrochemical oxidation had the lowest GWP, reducing it by approximately 49% compared to

307

IX following incineration.60 These findings suggest that regeneration and reuse of IX resins

308

could be one of the most environmentally friendly options for treating PFAS-contaminated

309

groundwater.

310

Several studies have focused on different water sources using various techniques for

311

PFAS treatment. A comprehensive LCA was performed to evaluate three end-of-life options for

312

aqueous film-forming foam containing spent fire-extinguishing waters: functional precipitation

313

agents (PerfluorAd process), GAC, and direct incineration.61 All three scenarios ultimately result

314

in the incineration of PFAS. The LCA results showed that the PerfluorAd process performed

315

best across all environmental impact categories for PFAS treatment. Another study evaluated

316

the sorption capacity of optimized sludge-based GAC media for removing nine commonly

317

detected PFAS from simulated wastewater.55 Notably, it was found that reducing the ZnCl2

318

impregnation ratio from 2.5 M to 1.5 M significantly decreased freshwater ecotoxicity, marine

319

ecotoxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity of the treated water by 49%.57 The ZnCl₂

320

impregnation ratio refers to the ratio of ZnCl₂ used to the precursor material. Specifically, it

321

indicates the amount of ZnCl₂ used in the chemical activation process of the sludge to produce

322

activated carbon. Further techniques such as multistage membrane technology and subcritical

323

water decomposition have also been investigated to find the environmental sustainability of

324

these technologies. Multistage membrane technology for PFAS removal from landfill leachate

325

found that offsite treatment was generally more sustainable than onsite treatment at high PFAS

326

concentrations, highlighting the need for improved membrane, electricity, and chemical usage

327

efficiencies for onsite treatment.56 Exploring subcritical water decomposition of PFOS,

328

researchers found that maintaining high temperature and pressure accounted for 99.8% of the

329

environmental impact, suggesting that enhancing energy efficiency and catalytic effectiveness is

330

crucial for reducing the environmental impact of subcritical water decomposition processes.55

331

These findings collectively highlight the environmental trade-offs between various PFAS

332

treatment technologies. While GAC and IX are commonly used, each technology presents

333

unique environmental impacts. The choice of treatment should consider the specific PFAS

334

contamination scenario and focus on optimizing the efficiency and sustainability of the selected

335

method.

2.3.2 Financial Viability.

337

Financial viability is key for selecting any treatment technology. Even if a technology

338

effectively removes PFAS from water, it won't be adopted if it's not financially sustainable. All the

339

papers we reviewed used net present value to assess the financial viability of their chosen

340

treatment technologies. Researchers used the USEPA's work breakdown structure model to

341

evaluate the financial viability of IX and GAC for PFAS removal from groundwater, considering

342

overall costs during their useful life.53,59 The life cycle inventory for each remediation system

343

estimated lifetime costs in real dollars and on a per-unit-volume basis ($/m³ treated). The results

344

shows that the single-use IX system has lower capital costs compared to the regenerable IX

345

system due to lower media usage rates, longer operational life, and fewer required components

346

(e.g., pumps, piping). While GAC media is generally cheaper, its high media usage rates and

347

larger vessel requirements make it less economically viable than IX treatment for PFAS. The

348

single-use IX system costs $0.28/m³, whereas the single-use GAC system costs $0.45/m³,

349

nearly twice the cost. Under the baseline scenario, single-use IX proves to be much more cost-

350

effective than GAC. However, GAC may be cheaper when applying very stringent PFAS

351

breakthrough criteria.

352

The financial viability of multistage membrane technology for landfill leachate treatment

353

compared offsite and onsite scenarios for PFAS compliance. Both the onsite and offsite

354

scenarios in the study include pretreatment processes before membrane treatment and

355

excluded the final fate of PFAS. The primary cost driver for onsite treatment is operational

356

expenses (45%) due to high electricity and chemical usage, while leachate transportation

357

accounts for 95% of offsite costs. Using 1 g of PFAS treated as the functional unit, the onsite

358

scenario's life cycle cost is 83% lower than the offsite scenario. However, treating 1 m³ of raw

359

leachate costs $1.96 onsite compared to $2.50 offsite, reflecting a 21% cost reduction for onsite

360

treatment despite its higher initial costs.56 The net present values of a two-pass spiral-wound

361

reverse osmosis system for additional leachate treatment in Thailand were $577.9 million USD

362

for a system with an evaporation pond and $391.9 million USD for a system without one.

363

Treatment unit costs ranged from $1.72 to $2.71 USD/m³ for the system with an evaporation

364

pond and from $1.06 to $2.09 USD/m³ for the system without the pond depending on landfill

365

size.63 The two-pass spiral-wound reverse osmosis system without an evaporation pond shows

366

lower treatment unit costs ($1.06 - $2.09 per m³) compared to the onsite multistage membrane

367

technology ($1.96 per m³). Despite higher initial costs, the overall financial viability is better for

368

the reverse osmosis system than onsite multistage membrane technology, especially without

369

the evaporation pond. While each PFAS treatment technology has trade-offs, the single-use IX

370

system and the two-pass spiral wound reverse osmosis system without an evaporation pond are

371

more financially viable options for groundwater and landfill leachate treatment, respectively.

372

These technologies offer lower costs per unit volume treated, and reduced operational

373

expenses, making them more attractive for practical application.

374

2.3.3 Social Impacts.

375

The social impacts of PFAS treatment technologies are still under-researched. All

376

treatment technologies encompass both positive and negative social aspects. The primary

377

social benefit is public health improvement due to PFAS removal from water sources. IX

378

treatment effectively removes PFAS from groundwater, reducing exposure and lowering the risk

379

of cancer and endocrine disruption. Similarly, GAC treatment significantly reduces PFAS levels

380

in drinking water, decreasing the risk of cancer, liver damage, and thyroid disease. However, IX

381

resin production and disposal pose social risks due to high ozone depletion potential, leading to

382

respiratory issues, and ecological damage. Conversely, GAC emits higher levels of carcinogens

383

and non-carcinogens compared to IX, negatively impacting air quality and human health.53,58,59,62

384

Previous research highlights important distinctions between different PFAS treatment

385

technologies, particularly in terms of health and social impacts. For example, IX has generally

386

been found to result in higher life cycle human health impacts compared to GAC.62 These

387

impacts are part of the treatment process itself and do not reflect the health benefits gained

388

from the reduction of contaminants in the treated water. This suggests that GAC may be a more

389

favorable option in contexts where minimizing health risks is a priority. Using the social

390

sustainability evaluation matrix, studies have demonstrated that GAC is more socially

391

sustainable than IX.53 The social sustainability evaluation matrix, an Excel-based tool, enables

392

users to specify, and quantify the social aspects of a project by identifying key indicators for

393

measurement. Its scoring system categorizes impacts into five sections: no impacts, positive,

394

ideal, negative, and unacceptable. This comprehensive assessment framework helps highlight

395

the social advantages of GAC over IX, reinforcing its potential benefits beyond just

396

environmental considerations. In the context of landfill leachate treatment, the choice between

397

onsite and offsite technologies has significant implications for human health. Research suggests

398

that onsite multistage membrane technology may provide greater health benefits compared to

399

offsite scenarios; however, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.56 One of the

400

main reasons could be the elimination of transportation risks and the ability to directly manage

401

and optimize the treatment process. This leads to lower human health risks associated with

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

402

PFAS exposure. This finding underscores the importance of location and technology integration

403

in optimizing the health outcomes of treatment processes. These insights collectively emphasize

404

the need for a holistic evaluation of PFAS treatment technologies, considering health, social,

405

and logistical factors. By understanding these nuances, decision-makers can better select and

406

implement technologies that align with broader sustainability goals.

3.0 Challenges to Sustainability.
Sustainability analysis of any treatment technologies evaluates their environmental,

415

social, and financial impacts. Quantitative Sustainable Design (QSD) is a structured

416

methodology used for accelerating and supporting the research, development, and deployment

417

of technologies.97,98 QSD integrates concepts from sustainability science and engineering to

418

facilitate the creation and implementation of sustainable solutions. A critical step in QSD is

419

defining the problem space, which includes the selection of variables or parameters that

420

influence sustainability, i.e., decision variables, technological parameters, and contextual

421

parameters. Previous studies on the sustainability of PFAS treatment technologies primarily

422

focus on GAC and IX. Table 1 highlights the different inputs for GAC and IX. It focuses on their

423

effects on environmental sustainability, social impacts, and financial viability. This table will help

424

future researchers to understand how decision variables, technological parameters, and

425

contextual parameters affect sustainability. It will also guide the design of more sustainable

426

PFAS treatment technologies for water sources.

427

3.1 Decision Variables.

428

Decision variables are independent inputs that can be controlled by the designer or

429

operator.98 For both GAC and IX technologies, an initial decision is whether to use single-use or

430

reactivated/regenerable options. Single-use GAC has significant environmental impacts due to

431

its high media usage rate and the need for frequent replacement and disposal. This frequent

432

replacement can lead to higher emissions of carcinogens and non-carcinogens, negatively

433

affecting air quality and human health in surrounding communities.59 In contrast, reactivating

434

GAC media reduces these impacts by decreasing the demand for new media production; thus

435

lowering resource consumption and waste generation. Reactivation processes also mitigate

436

negative health impacts by reducing the frequency of GAC media replacement; thereby lowering

437

emissions. Although the initial costs for reactivation infrastructure can be high, reactivated GAC

438

is more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable than single-use GAC. This is particularly

439

true at higher contaminant concentrations because reactivated GAC has lower operational costs

440

for media replacement and disposal.59,62 Similarly, the choice between single-use and

441

regenerable IX also significantly affects sustainability. Both single use and regenerable IX have

442

lower environmental impacts compared to single-use GAC, primarily due to their extended

443

operational life and reduced media usage rate. However, the production phase of regenerable

444

IX presents social risks, particularly high carcinogenic emissions, fossil fuel depletion, and

445

global warming potential. These can lead to long-term health and environmental

446

consequences.53,58,59,62 The type of sorbent used in GAC primarily affects environmental

447

sustainability and financial viability. Media from different carbon sources have varying adsorption

448

capacities and lifespans, which impact the frequency of replacement, resource consumption,

449

and waste generation. Bituminous GAC is widely recognized in research as one of the most

450

effective media for removing PFAS. However, there is still a lack of studies addressing its

451

environmental sustainability and financial viability.99–102 Each decision variable can involve trade-

452

offs across overall sustainability of the PFAS treatment technologies. Therefore, a

453

comprehensive evaluation is necessary to optimize treatment outcomes.

454

3.2 Technological Parameters.

455

Technological parameters, inherent to a technology's design and operations,

456

significantly impact the sustainability of PFAS treatment systems, and are determined by the

457

technology itself, not the designer or operator.98 Effective PFAS treatment technologies require

458

careful consideration of several key technological parameters, each of which impacts

459

environmental sustainability, social impacts, and financial viability. For both IX and GAC, media

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

460

production and incineration of spent media are the major sources of environmental impact.

461

Media production for GAC requires activation processes and may involve mining (e.g., coal),

462

which consumes high energy and release greenhouse gases, making this phase a major

463

contributor to the environmental impact of GAC treatment systems. Similarly, the production of

464

IX resins, particularly single-use resins, involves the synthesis of polymers. This process causes

465

high environmental impacts, including ozone-depleting emissions.59 Incineration of spent media

466

from both GAC and IX, especially when used as single-use, is energy-intensive (above 1100°C

467

for GAC) and results in emissions that contribute to global warming. Single-use IX systems have

468

higher impacts from incineration compared to GAC. This is particularly applicable for human

469

toxicity, cancer, eutrophication, and ecotoxicity due to the energy required for resin production.

470

Incineration also involves high operational costs, increasing the financial burden of both GAC

471

and IX treatment technologies.59,61 Effective management of spent media can mitigate these

472

impacts. For instance, off-site thermal reactivation of GAC media reduces the need for new

473

media production and minimizes waste, positively impacting environmental sustainability.59

474

However, the transportation and reactivation processes still contribute to environmental and

475

social impacts. In IX systems, regenerating spent media involves handling and disposing of

476

brine and cosolvents containing PFAS, which can cause significant environmental impacts and

477

social risks due to the release of hazardous substances during incineration.58,59

478

Empty bed contact time and bed volume are directly proportional, as empty bed contact

479

time is calculated by dividing the bed volume by the flow rate. While both are critical in PFAS

480

treatment system design, their impacts on sustainability and costs are intertwined. For GAC

481

systems, which typically require longer empty bed contact time (around 10 minutes) compared

482

to IX systems (2-3 minutes), this means larger bed volumes, resulting in higher energy use,

483

greater material needs, and increased costs.53,59 In contrast, shorter empty bed contact time

484

allow for smaller bed volumes in IX systems reduces energy and space requirements, making

485

them more efficient environmentally and economically.53,59 Another critical parameter affecting

486

the sustainability of PFAS treatment technologies is media usage rate. A higher media usage

487

rate results in frequent media replacements, increased production, and greater disposal needs,

488

which escalate the environmental footprint and raise operational costs. High media usage rates

489

in GAC systems lead to frequent replacements. This increases media production and disposal

490

needs, escalating both environmental impacts and operational costs. Meanwhile, lower media

491

usage rates in IX systems extend media life. This reduces replacement frequency, minimizes

492

environmental impacts and lowers costs.59 Optimizing media usage rate can balance

493

operational efficiency and sustainability, reducing both environmental and financial impacts. The

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

494

choice of activating agent in GAC significantly affects both environmental sustainability and

495

financial viability. For example, optimizing sludge-based GAC adsorbents by reducing the

496

activating agent (ZnCl2) impregnation ratio can substantially lower environmental impacts and

497

decrease production costs.57 By understanding and optimizing these technological parameters,

498

stakeholders can better balance the environmental sustainability, social impacts, and financial

499

viability of PFAS treatment technologies. This comprehensive approach is essential for

500

designing more sustainable solutions for PFAS removal from water sources.

501

3.3 Contextual Parameters.

502

Contextual parameters represent non-technological values that influence the

503

sustainability of technologies, particularly during the deployment stage.98 These parameters are

504

designed to capture the specific circumstances in which the technology will be implemented.

505

The length of PFAS chains significantly impacts the environmental sustainability, social impacts,

506

and financial viability for both GAC and IX systems. IX resins were identified as a cost-effective

507

adsorbent for removing both long and short-chain PFAS compared to GAC adsorbents.32

508

Previous research indicates that IX systems have a higher adsorption capacity than GAC and

509

are more effective at removing long-chain PFAS, like PFOA and PFOS, compared to short-chain

510

PFAS.1 Studies show that GAC also adsorbs long-chain PFAS better than short-chain PFAS.103

511

This indicates that both IX resins and GAC adsorbents exhibit higher adsorption capacity for

512

long-chain PFAS compared to short-chain PFAS. In another study, sludge-based GAC exhibited

513

the lowest removal rate (35.3–57.8%) for short-chain PFAS compounds, likely due to their high

514

solubility and low hydrophobicity.104,105 Increasing the empty bed contact time can enhance the

515

efficiency of GAC in removing short-chain PFAS, offering protection against the rapid

516

breakthrough of short-chain PFAS.32,106 GAC and IX treatments require a longer empty bed

517

contact time for short-chain PFAS compared to long-chain PFAS.32 Both long-chain and short-

518

chain PFAS pose significant social impacts, primarily through health risks. Compared to long-

519

chain PFAS, treating short-chain PFAS requires a higher media usage rate, which increases

520

environmental impacts. This includes higher values for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic

521

effects, as well as global warming potential, indicating greater health damage compared to long-

522

chain PFAS. Consequently, the treatment of short-chain PFAS may lead to higher overall

523

environmental, social, and financial damage.

524

PFAS concentration is another important parameter that effects the sustainability. Both

525

groundwater and bottled water were examined under a range of PFOA and PFOS

526

concentrations covering three orders of magnitude (0.7, 7.0, and 70 μg/L) using both GAC

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

527

adsorbents and IX resins. Higher PFAS concentrations significantly impact environmental

528

sustainability and social health issues. As PFAS levels increase, greenhouse gas emissions

529

from GAC-based treatment rise, reaching 0.54 and 2.7 kg CO2eq/m3 H2O at 7.0 and 70 μg/L

530

PFAS, respectively.60,62 GAC media production and reactivation processes result in greater

531

environmental impacts compared to IX-based treatments at higher contaminant levels. Energy

532

consumption for GAC increases substantially, contributing to impacts such as fossil fuel

533

depletion, respiratory effects, and smog formation. At high PFAS concentrations, electricity

534

consumption contributes significantly to climate change impacts: 15% for GAC and 63% for IX

535

treatment. Human health impacts are also heightened, with electricity production (mainly coal-

536

fired) responsible for over 75-90% of health and ecotoxicity impacts from both GAC and IX

537

systems. As PFAS concentrations rise from 0.7 to 70 μg/L, life cycle electricity consumption

538

increases from 1.5 to 1.9 MJ/m3 for GAC and from 1.5 to 1.6 MJ/ m3 for IX, amplifying both

539

health and environmental consequences.62

540

Disposal options for spent media primarily impact environmental sustainability and

541

financial viability. For GAC systems, the disposal of activated carbon significantly impacts

542

acidification and ozone depletion. Additionally, incineration of spent media at high temperatures

543

(above 1100°C) results in substantial greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants,

544

contributing to global warming and degradation of air quality59,61 Similarly, for IX systems,

545

disposal of brine and cosolvents containing PFAS can lead to hazardous emissions during

546

incineration, impacting both environmental and social sustainability due to potential health

547

risks.59,60 Financially, incineration and other disposal methods incur high operational costs,

548

increasing the overall treatment cost. Maintenance significantly impacts the financial viability of

549

both GAC and IX systems. GAC systems face higher operational costs due to frequent media

550

replacements, despite having lower annual operating and maintenance costs compared to IX

551

systems.53 IX systems, while having higher initial capital costs, benefit from lower media usage

552

rates and longer operational life, reducing the need for frequent replacements. While the

553

regeneration process adds to IX operational costs, these systems are more cost-effective over

554

time due to reduced maintenance needs. Effective maintenance strategies are essential to

555

optimize the financial viability of both GAC and IX treatment technologies.

556

Infrastructure requirements significantly affect financial viability and environmental

557

sustainability. Treatment systems need contactors, pipes, fittings, and corrosion-resistant

558

coatings. The infrastructure for resin treatment and regeneration is assumed to be twice as

559

complex as that for GAC due to its added components.62 Despite its reusability, regenerable IX

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ds733 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-9179 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

560

is the second most impactful system after single-use GAC because of the additional

561

infrastructure and chemical-intensive regeneration processes.59 Although capital impacts are

562

generally minimal, they are significant for single-use IX due to its low media usage rates. For

563

reactivated GAC, the absence of high-temperature incineration shifts more impact to

564

infrastructure requirements for regeneration. Energy consumption significantly affects the

565

financial viability and environmental sustainability of PFAS treatment technologies. High energy

566

use increases production costs, making technologies less efficient. GAC adsorbents production

567

and reactivation consume substantial energy, leading to higher life cycle impacts like fossil fuel

568

depletion and respiratory effects.62 Thermal reactivation of GAC adsorbents, at 815°C, is less

569

energy-intensive than incineration at 1200°C, making it more cost-effective.59,61 Regenerable IX

570

systems also increase energy demand due to the salts used in regeneration, especially those

571

derived from chemicals(e.g., NH4Cl, K2CO3).58 Both GAC and IX systems are sensitive to local

572

electricity grid variations, affecting costs and environmental impacts. For example, electricity

573

prices vary from 5.07 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in Oklahoma to 35.86 cents/kWh in Hawaii,

574

and GHG emissions from electricity range widely.107 Switching to renewable energy sources,

575

like wind or solar, can significantly reduce human health costs and global warming potential,

576

making renewable energy a key target for cost and impact reduction.

4. Charting Pathways for Sustainable Treatment of PFAS.

585

The new US EPA regulation requires public water systems to complete initial monitoring

586

of six PFAS, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA),

587

hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), and mixtures containing at least two or more

588

of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) by 2027.108 If the

589

concentration of these PFAS exceeds the maximum contaminant levels (MCL), solutions to

590

reduce their concentrations must be implemented by 2029. The EPA estimates that the new

591

regulation will reduce PFAS exposure for about 100 million Americans, leading to fewer cases of

592

cancer, liver disease, and birth complications. This will result in annual health benefits of

593

approximately $1.5 billion, covering reduced medical costs and lost income.109 The actual

594

benefits are likely higher, considering unquantified health effects like developmental and

595

cardiovascular issues. While, according to AWWA, the national cost for treating long-chain

596

PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpA, and PFNA) at a 4 ppt level is approximately $60 billion in

597

the United States. This underscores the need for sustainable and cost-effective PFAS treatment

598

technologies that effectively remove these contaminants from water.110 As current situation

599

demands sustainable treatment technologies to eliminate persistent PFAS from water sources,

600

comprehensive sustainability studies are required. These studies must encompass existing

601

technologies and explore new solutions under various scenarios, including different water types,

602

indicators of sustainability, prioritization and weighting of the indicators. To navigate the

603

extensive opportunity space for sustainable PFAS treatment, it is mandatory to integrate

604

sustainability analyses throughout the research, development, and deployment phases of

technologies. Our review of existing literature on PFAS water treatment technologies has led to

606

the development of a proposed framework for understanding sustainable PFAS treatment

607

(Figure 2). The initial step in the sustainable treatment of PFAS involves identifying the type of

608

water requiring treatment, e.g., groundwater, wastewater, drinking water, tap water, or fire

609

extinguishing water. Each water type presents unique challenges and necessitates different

610

treatment approaches. Based on the water type, appropriate treatment methods, such as IX,

611

GAC, RO, or other technologies, are selected. Next, inputs are specified, including decision

612

variables (e.g., single-use or regenerable media), technological parameters (e.g., media

613

production, bed volume), and contextual parameters (e.g., PFAS length, concentration).

614

Sustainability is assessed across three primary indicators: environmental sustainability, financial

615

viability, and social impacts. Tools such as TEA, LCA, and others are employed to evaluate

616

these indicators. Models like MIVES integrate results from environmental, financial, and social

617

assessments.53 The prioritization of indicators through ranking and weighting guides the final

618

sustainability assessment. For example, the MIVES model was used to integrate results from

619

environmental, financial, and social assessments for GAC and IX under different weighting

620

scenarios. The scenarios included equal weighting of all indicators (33% each), higher weighting

621

on social impacts (60%), and higher weighting on financial viability (50%). The results

622

suggested that IX treatment is generally more sustainable than GAC treatment.53

623

By following this framework (Figure 2), we can identify the most sustainable treatment

624

technology for specific scenarios. If the results do not meet environmental guidelines or financial

625

constraints, we can revisit any point in the proposed framework and choose alternative options.

626

This framework is iterative, allowing for adjustments in treatment methods and re-prioritization of

627

indicators. This iterative approach ensures the selection of sustainable and effective PFAS

628

treatment method for particular water and contaminant types. Each treatment technology

629

involves trade-offs. This framework supports the sustainable treatment of PFAS by guiding the

630

evaluation of both established and emerging technologies. For established technologies like

631

GAC and IX, historical data and proven methods are used to specify inputs, assess

632

sustainability, and optimize execution. For emerging technologies, it accommodates flexible

633

parameters, experimental data, and iterative testing to refine and validate new treatment

634

methods. This approach ensures balanced consideration of environmental, social, and financial

635

impacts for all PFAS treatment technologies. The US EPA’s three R’s (Research, Restrict, and

636

Remediate) are key directives in tackling PFAS, the “forever chemicals.” Our study finds that

637

research on sustainability of PFAS treatment technologies is still in its developmental stages

638

and requires further investigation across various scenarios. Alternative technologies, including

639

reverse osmosis and nanotechnology for PFAS removal, as well as destruction technologies like

640

advanced oxidation processes, electrochemical oxidation, and plasma, require thorough

641

sustainability assessments to ensure their effectiveness and feasibility for comprehensive PFAS

642

treatment. Additionally, existing sustainability studies on treatments like GAC and IX are limited,

643

as they rarely examine all three sustainability parameters: environmental sustainability, social

644

impacts, and financial viability. This review underscores the uncertainties in sustainability

645

indicators and the trade-offs within different treatment systems. Overall, this study highlights the

646

potential to reveal the sustainability implications of PFAS removal technologies in specific

647

contexts. This enables stakeholders to make informed decisions about the multidimensional

effects of these technologies, ultimately contributing to society’s transition towards greater

649

sustainability.
