Abstract

13

Granular activated carbon (GAC) is widely used to treat contaminated per- and polyfluoroalkyl

14

substances (PFAS) waste streams, resulting in the accumulation of large quantities of spent GAC that

15

need to be landfilled or regenerated. A novel modified supercritical CO 2 (scCO2) extraction for

16

regeneration of spent GAC is developed. With the addition of organic solvents and acid modifiers, the

17

procedure yielded > 97% perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) desorption after a 60-minute treatment in a

18

continuous flow reactor. The mild extraction conditions at T ~ 100°C do not trigger the formation of

19

volatile organic fluorine or changes in GAC sorbent properties. Mechanistically, the high miscibility of

20

co-solvent/scCO2 eliminates diffusion transport limitations, enabling rapid reagent and PFAS transport in

21

a single-phase (gas-like) medium. The introduction of organic co-solvent and the absence of water

22

reverses hydrophobic interactions between GAC and the PFAS. The acid modifier minimizes the

23

electrostatic PFOA/ GAC interactions by protonating the perfluorooctanoate ion and providing

24

competition for active GAC sites. The approach offers an economically effective regeneration scheme,

25

enabling the reuse of sorbents and yielding effluent with a high loading of PFAS that is amenable to

26

subsequent end-of-life treatment technologies.

Synopsis: Supercritical CO2 with minimal co-solvents regenerates PFOA-laden GAC with > 99.9%

desorption efficiency.

32

Granular activated carbon (GAC) is used to treat contaminated waters with per- and

33

polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 1 While widespread adoption of GAC offers a cost-effective

34

solution, it also creates a pressing need for managing the accumulation of spent GAC. Sorbent

35

regeneration unlocks the potential for sustainable, large-scale treatment of PFAS-contaminated

36

streams. 2 Thermal regeneration utilizes high temperatures, ~600-1000°C, to desorb PFAS and

37

other contaminants. The higher temperatures can also effectively destroy PFAS in situ; however,

38

the process is energy-demanding and can lead to GAC degradation and loss. 3 Recent studies also

39

show that thermal degradation yields the formation of volatile organo-fluorine (VOF)

40

compounds that could re-enter the environment as gases or aerosols. 4

41

Motivated by the development of various end-of-life PFAS destruction technologies 5, 6, the

42

effective PFAS transport from sorbents into concentrated liquid feedstock becomes highly

43

desirable. Approaches that can desorb PFAS without forming VOFs while preserving GAC's

44

structural and adsorptive properties are highly desirable. Several reported low-temperature

45

methods rely on organic solvents 7-10 or aqueous solutions 8. The application of these methods for

46

the desorption of long-chain (C-8) PFAS is challenging due to their strong affinity to surfaces,

47

and the large quantities of solvents required for GAC treatment hinder large-scale

48

implementation (Table S1). 11

49

Above its critical point (31°C, 7.4 MPa), CO2 becomes a supercritical fluid (scCO2)–a nonpolar

50

solvent with low dielectric constant and negligible molecular dipole moment. 12 Supercritical

51

fluid extraction (SFE) temperatures (T < 100° C ) would not trigger volatile fluorinated species

52

formation via thermal degradation. 6, 13 SFE is used in commercial applications for removing

organics from solid matrices, e.g., botanical extraction, surface sterilization, food pasteurization,

54

and material synthesis. 12, 14 In analytical chemistry, the SFE enables quantitative PAH recovery

55

from sorbent traps at T =45° C . 15 There is also a report on scCO2 use to extract PFOA and PFOS

56

from nonporous materials such as paper, fabrics, and sand. 16

57

This study is the first investigation of low-temperature spent GAC regeneration using scCO 2

58

extraction with the addition of co-solvents and acid modifiers. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)

59

was chosen for this study due to its environmental persistence and high adsorption affinity, yet

60

our modified SFE approach yielded >99% desorption after 1 hour of GAC treatment.

64

Each GAC sample was weighed (0.71  0.01 g) and mixed with 19.0 mL of an aqueous solution

65

of PFOA at 20 ppm. After 5 days, the GAC was removed, and the liquid was analyzed using LC-

66

MS/MS. The GAC pellets were dried in an oven at 70°C for 12 hours. The spent GAC sub-

67

samples were extracted into 20 mL of ethanol (EtOH) + 0.15% NH4OH solution 11 to determine

68

the amount of PFOA sorbed onto GAC. After 24 hours, the GAC was removed, and the liquid

69

was analyzed using LC-MS/MS.

Figure S1 describes the laboratory continuous flow reactor used in this study. The CO 2 from the

71

gas cylinder is condensed to the liquid phase in a calcium chloride cold bath (-10 to -5°C) CO2

and pumped at 25 mL/min. The co-solvent (MeOH, or MeOH + 1% v/v H2SO4) injected at

73

1 mL/min, T~20°C, is mixed with scCO 2 before entering the reactor section. The CO 2 and

74

solvent post-mixing become a supercritical single-phase fluid if the organic solvent does not

75

exceed its solubility limit in the scCO2. 17 P = 20.3 MPa, T = 110 - 120°С were chosen as the

operational parameters to satisfy single-phase conditions. After performing SFE for 60 minutes,

77

the column contents were dried in an oven at 70°C for 24 hours. The sample was divided into

78

two sub-samples: one was subjected to extraction by soaking in EtOH and ammonium

79

hydroxide, followed by LC-MS/MS; the other was loaded with PFOA again and underwent a

80

second regeneration cycle. Each experiment was performed in triplicates. The desorption

efficiency (DE) was calculated as:

DE=

[ PFAS ∈spent GAC ] −[ PFAS ∈GAC after regeneration ]
× 100 %,
[ PFAS ∈spent GAC ]

83

where [PFAS in spent GAC] is the PFOA concentration (mg/g) in the spent sorbent, and [PFAS

84

in GAC after regeneration] is the PFOA concentration (mg/g) in the regenerated sorbent.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1

Modified scCO2 method for GAC regeneration

87

PFOA exhibits strong adsorption onto GAC due to hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions,

88

which present challenges for conventional techniques. 18 The modified scCO2 extraction yielded

89

near complete desorption of PFOA (Figure 1) by counteracting both forces. First, the method

90

takes advantage of the transition from a polar aqueous to a nonpolar scCO 2 environment, which

91

weakens/eliminates hydrophobic interactions. Once in scCO 2, PFOA miscibility decreases

92

compared to the shorter fluorinated molecules. 19 Due to the high polarity of the

93

perfluorooctanoate ion, C8F15O2-, electrostatic interactions become the dominant force; therefore,

94

in pure scCO2, desorption efficiency was limited to < 30% (Figure 2).

95

The addition of organic co-solvents can enhance PFAS solubility in scCO 2. E.g., Chen et al. 16

96

reported that the scCO2/ MeOH mixture was effective in extracting PFOA and PFOS from

97

nonporous materials. Table S1 shows that organic solvent-based extraction (MeOH, EtOH,

98

Acetone) in the batch GAC/ C-8 PFAS systems reach the DE ~ 40-95% after 12-24 hours. 7, 8

99

MeOH extraction showed the best results. Chularueangaksorn et al. utilized a column flow

100

reactor and MeOH, reporting DE = 67% desorption of PFOA from GAC 400 after 24 hours of

101

treatment. 9 The solubility of PFAS in alcohols generally decreases for longer PFAS molecules

102

and longer carbon chain lengths of alcohol. 20 For example, the solubility of PFOS in MeOH is

103

~ 37 g/L; it is ~ 5 times higher than in EtOH (~ 7 g/L). The solubility of PFOA in MeOH is

104

37.1 g/L, similar to PFOS's. Thus, in this proof-of-concept study, MeOH is used as a co-solvent.

105

In our experiment, adding MeOH alone did not significantly affect PFOA desorption (Figure 1),

106

indicating that scCO2 is an effective agent for disrupting the hydrophobic interaction. A slight

107

increase in desorption efficiency from 18.7% to 26.3% in the second cycle might be attributed to

108

carryover from the previous cycle. While dipolar organic solvents can disrupt hydrophobic

109

interactions 18, 21, they are unlikely to affect the electrostatic interactions between PFAS

110

molecules and GAC surfaces. 16 Lacking hydrophobic PFOA/GAC interaction in scCO2 and

111

scCO2/MeOH mixtures, the low desorption is contributed to electrostatic interactions, which can

112

be weakened by introducing an ionic agent. Thus, adding sulfuric acid (1% vol in MeOH)

113

increased the desorption efficiency to >97%.

119

The modified SFE regeneration method yielded significantly faster and more efficient PFAS

120

removal compared to conventional solvent-based techniques (Table S1). Treatment time was

121

1 hour, compared to 5-24 hours for traditional methods, yielding >97% PFAS removal (max

122

DE~99.9%). Notably, solvent consumption was decreased to ~ 4% of other reported solvent-

123

based methods, presenting an environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach for GAC

124

regeneration. The synergistic result of combining scCO2, a co-solvent, and an acid modifier

125

achieves remarkable desorption results and complete restoration of GAC properties (Table 1).

126

3.2

Proposed mechanisms for modified supercritical CO2 GAC regeneration

127

PFOA/GAC interaction is governed by two key forces, which must be effectively counteracted.

128

Specifically, the Filtrasorb 400 GAC has a point of zero charge (pH pzc) of 8.65, 1 characteristic of

129

activated carbons with low oxygen content. 22 The low oxygen content is reflected in the

130

measured concentration of oxygen-containing groups (phenolic, carboxylic, lactonic) of

131

0.21 mmol/g. 23 The measured pH during adsorption in this study (~ 4.8) was below the pHpzc.

132

Under such conditions, the surface of the activated carbon becomes positively charged due to the

133

protonation of surface groups, enhancing electrostatic interactions with negatively charged PFAS

134

anions. The shift to the scCO2 environment weakened hydrophobic interactions, leading to a

135

change from a predominantly surface-aligned orientation to a perpendicular orientation. This

136

reorientation, consistent with the classical work of Zisman and colleagues 24, minimizes the

137

contribution of hydrophobic forces, leaving electrostatic interactions as the dominant force

138

between the monovalent PFOA anion and the GAC surface in the scCO2 environment.

139

Route I is enabled by the high dielectric permittivity of scCO 2, facilitating proton availability

140

from PFOA dissociation. This can lead to the association of PFOA molecules (Figure 2, Route I)

141

and subsequent desorption in its protonated form. However, this route exhibits limited efficacy

142

for PFOA, DE < 30% (Figure 1). The effectiveness of this route may vary in other systems.

143

Route II involves the interaction of CO2 molecules with water retained in the GAC pores,

144

leading to the formation of bicarbonate ions. While the bicarbonate ion is typically a weak

145

competitor for PFAS on GAC under normal conditions, the high concentration of CO2 and small

146

pore volume may enhance the effect (Figure 2, Route II). However, the presence of water within

147

the pores can also promote hydrophobic interactions, potentially hindering the efficacy of Route

148

II.

149

Route III is based on disrupting the electrostatic forces between GAC and PFAS. The scCO 2 or

150

methanol cannot effectively weaken the electrostatic interaction between GAC and PFOA.

151

Figure 1 shows no significant change in desorption efficiency from scCO 2 to scCO2/ MeOH

152

experiments. On the other hand, adding the MeOH/ acid mixture yields significant improvement

153

in the PFOA desorption. The MeOH assists in introducing sulfuric acid to a single-phase

154

supercritical mixture and ultimately inside the sorbent’s pores. Mechanistically, a divalent sulfate

155

ion exhibits a stronger affinity to the active sites on the GAC surface, causing the release of a

156

weaker PFOA monovalent perfluorooctanoate ion, C8F15O2- (Figure 2, Route III). Moreover,

157

sulfuric acid (pKa = -3) can protonate PFOA (pKa = - 0.2 – +3.8). 25 The long-chain PFAS may

158

form micelles/hemi-micelles 18, 26 in an aqueous environment that can interact with the GAC

159

surface during sorption; however, it is unclear if these structures interact in a scCO2/organic co-

160

solvent environment in the absence of liquid water. We expected that micelle formation is

161

negligible in a nonpolar solvent and does not significantly affect the proposed mechanism of

162

hydrophobic and electrostatic forces disruption in the scCO2 environment. Though beyond the

163

scope of the current report and the subject of ongoing work, we suspect that Route III should also

164

hold for other PFAS.

3.3

Impacts of co-solvent concentration on regeneration efficiency

172

Increasing the concentration of acid-modified co-solvent in scCO 2 yielded the highest desorption

173

efficiency of 99.9% (Figure S2). In these experiments, the CO 2 flow rate was constant

174

(25 mL/min), and the co-solvent flow rate varied from 0.2 to 6.8 mL/min. The results showed

175

only marginal improvement for high MeOH flow rates. This corroborates that the hydrophobic

176

interaction does not play a significant role in the scCO2 environment, and the disruption of

177

electrostatic attraction by the pH surface modifier is the dominant mechanism. Further research

178

is needed to optimize the acid concentration in the scCO2/ MeOH mixture and substitute MeOH

179

with more environmentally friendly solvents.

180

From a practical perspective, these observations suggest that the process can yield a very

181

concentrated effluent, reducing consumption of co-solvent and, in turn, reducing the volume of

182

effluent that needs to be treated in the end-of-life destruction step. In a binary CO 2/ solvent

183

system, the pressure, temperature, and mole fractions of each solvent determine the phase of the

184

overall fluid mixture. Based on data extrapolation from Reighard et al.27, at X MeOH =0.1792 and

185

10 MPa, the dew point of the CO2/ MeOH mixture is at ~ 110°C. Assuming that a trace

186

concentration of sulfuric acid does not affect the solubility of MeOH in CO 2, a lower X MeOH

187

would lead to a single-phase supercritical gas-like mixture of MeOH completely dissolved in

188

CO2, while a higher X MeOH would lead to a two-phase mixture of liquid MeOH and the gas-like

189

scCO2. Adjusting the flow rates controls MeOH concentration and mixture phase during

190

regeneration. Though limiting the concentration of MeOH produces more concentrated effluent,

191

the presence of a liquid interface at the GAC surface may improve the desorption and

192

regeneration efficiency, as seen in the experiment at 6.8 mL/min, where the experimental

193

condition was close to the MeOH dew point.

194

3.4

Assessment of GAC properties after regeneration

195

A sustainable PFAS regeneration approach must also maintain GAC's structural integrity and

196

adsorption capacity after regeneration. Table 1 shows that BET surface area and micropore

197

volume of spent GAC decreased (971 to 922 m2/g), indicating the occupation of active sorption

198

sites and pore blockage by PFOA molecules. After the regeneration step, the BET surface area

199

and micropore volume slightly increased (971 to 1012 m2/g) compared to the virgin GAC.

200

Though it is unclear what fraction of PFOA molecules resided within the micropores or on the

201

surface, the modified SFE could desorb PFOA from all active sites, preserving the GAC porous

202

structure. The adsorption capacity of regenerated GAC was 0.52 ± 0.02 mg/g—nearly identical

203

to the virgin GAC. We inferred that sulfate ions that competed with the C 8F15O2- ion in the scCO2

204

environment entered the aqueous phase during the next adsorption cycle, allowing reuse of

205

regenerated GAC.

Traditional waste management approaches often involve the disposal of contaminated

209

adsorbents, leading to substantial environmental and economic burdens. This unsustainable

210

practice necessitates the development of efficient and environmentally friendly spent sorbent

211

regeneration approaches. Our scCO2-based sorbent regeneration method holds significant

212

promise for mitigating the environmental impact of PFAS contamination, offering a sustainable

213

alternative to traditional practices. Mild temperature conditions minimize energy consumption

214

and reduce the risk of sorbent degradation. Though the CO 2 was naturally aspirated during the

215

experiment, it can be captured and reused in practical applications. After dropping the

216

temperature and pressure below supercritical conditions, the MeOH, H 2SO4, and PFOA mixture

217

naturally separates to form a concentrated liquid effluent.

218

The modified SFE process offers significant environmental benefits. The need for disposal is

219

minimized by regenerating the GAC, reducing landfill waste, and reducing the associated

220

environmental impact. Reusable GAC practices lessen the demand for new materials, promoting

resource conservation and minimizing the environmental impact of production. Furthermore, the

222

process produces a concentrated PFAS effluent, facilitating efficient and cost-effective

223

downstream end-of-life PFAS (and other contaminant) destruction. Future research should focus

224

on expanding the applicability of this method to a broader range of PFAS compounds and

225

optimizing operational parameters (e.g., temperature, exposure time, and co-solvent

226

formulation). The potential of this approach extends beyond GAC regeneration, with

227

applications for other sorbents, such as ion-exchange resins.
