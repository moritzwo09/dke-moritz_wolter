Non-target chemical analysis of drinking water revealed the presence of two new disinfectant
by-product (DBP) groups in the UK, halogenated-hydroxycyclopentenediones and

alkaline pH. Furthermore, spectral and computational data for TBHCD and three other
halogenated-hydroxycyclopentenediones indicated they could act as a source of radicals in
water and in the body. Importantly, TBHCD was calculated to have a 14.5 kcal mol-1 lower CBr bond dissociation enthalpy than the N-Br bond of N-bromosuccinimide, a common radical

Introduction
A steadily increasing amount of anthropogenic chemical substances are produced
worldwide,1,2 generating an increasing potential for drinking water contamination.
Environmental factors are assumed to play a major role in chronic diseases, and yet
comprehensive evaluation of environmental exposures and relationship to disease is far from
being achieved.3 In fact, the number of substances analysed by target analysis is limited to a
very small fraction of the substances potentially present.4 The investigation of previously
unknown potentially toxic compounds in drinking water is a long and resource-intensive

process. Non-target analysis (NTA) can generate tentative identifications, but these are rarely
followed-up by structure confirmation or in silico toxicity prediction. For most substances,
reference materials are not commercially available and synthesis is required for unequivocal
structural confirmation, toxicological testing, and quantification in drinking water before risk
assessment can be performed.
The health risks associated with exposure to halogenated disinfection by products
(DBPs) in drinking water have been previously documented.5 Some halogenated disinfection
by-products (DBPs) are now considered probably carcinogenic to humans.6,7 Genetic damage
is a distinctive feature of human cancers,8 and many chlorinated and brominated DBPs cause
mutations in pro- and eukaryotic cells.5,9 However, chromatographic techniques commonly
used for DBP analysis, i.e., mainly gas chromatography and reversed-phase liquid
chromatography (RPLC), are not necessarily suitable for very polar and ionic species that could
have led to substantial underdetection in the past.10 Here we have used mixed-mode anionexchange RPLC to conduct an in-depth investigation of acidic contaminants present in London
drinking water using non-targeted and suspect screening analysis.

This resulted in the

discovery of emerging polar DBPs which in silico analysis flagged as potentially harmful to
humans.11 In particular, halogenated-methanesulfonic acids (HMSAs), which were previously
reported and classified as DBPs in drinking water,12,13 were subsequently confirmed to be
present in London’s drinking water. These compounds were found at concentrations close to
the µg L-1 range, and predicted as mutagenic (specifically, dibromomethanesulfonic acid).11 All
HMSAs were also predicted as developmental toxicants by USEPA Toxicity Estimation Software
Tool.11 While predictions are useful to help with prioritization, their toxicity has to be verified.
In addition to these substances, halogenated-hydroxycyclopentenediones (HHCDs) were also
tentatively identified. In particular, tribromo-HCD (TBHCD) was previously reported in Swedish

and Chinese drinking water, but with uncertainty about its exact structure.14-16 Recently, it has
been

shown

that

HHCDs

are

present

when

chlorination,

chloramination,

ozonation/chlorination and ozonation/chloramination are employed for potabilization.17 An
in-depth analysis of the distinctive fragmentation pattern found in the product ion scan
spectrum (PIS), combined with the definition of a complete formation mechanism, allowed us
to assign an unequivocal structure (2,2,4-tribromo-5-hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione),
which was predicted as mutagenic. However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis
and/or X-ray crystallography are critical for unequivocal structure confirmation. Three
additional tri-halogenated HCDs were also tentatively identified frequently in London drinking
water and predicted as mutagenic: trichloro-HCD (TCHCD), bromodichloro-HCD (BDCHCD),
and chlorodibromo-HCD (CDBHCD).11 Further research into HMSAs and HHCDs is required to
understand their prevalence and potential health risks.
Our attempts to isolate TBHCD through bromination of 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde
were previously unsuccessful due to losses during evaporation.11 Previously, TBHCD was
isolated by freeze-drying 1 L of combined LC fractions; the resulting 10 mg substance were
characterised by infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS).14 Unfortunately, no
additional spectroscopic evidence was provided, and the exact structure remains to be
confirmed. Exhaustive bromination of 4-hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione (HCD) has been
documented, but stoichiometry, temperature, reaction concentrations and characterisation
data are unavailable.18 HCD has been previously synthesized by Claisen condensation of
diethyl oxalate with diethyl-1,3-acetonedicarboxylate, followed by decarboxylation of the
crude intermediate diester under acidic conditions.19 An alternative procedure using ethyl
acetoacetate with a decarboxylation-acetylation-decarboxylation protocol to avoid the need
for sublimation has been reported, but insufficient detail exists to replicate it.20 Overall, a

reliable procedure for laboratory scale preparation of TBHCD is required to enable exposure
and toxicological analysis.
The principal aim of this work was to investigate the occurrence, reactivity, stability
and toxicity of TBHCD. The objectives included: (a) synthesis and purification of TBHCD via
exhaustive bromination of 4-hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione; (b) TBHCD and DBMSA
quantification in municipal drinking water samples to provide initial estimate of exposure; (c)
In vitro mutagenicity testing of both substances using Salmonella/microsome assay with
strains TA100, TA98 and TA102; (d) semi-quantification of other HHCDs and HMSAs to evaluate
their relative concentration levels in municipal water; (e) investigation of the reactivity of
TBHCD.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterisation of 2,2,4-tribromo-5-hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione
As represented schematically in Figure 1A, HCD was obtained via Claisen condensation of
diethyl oxalate with diethyl-1,3-acetonedicarboxylate, followed by decarboxylation of the
crude

intermediate

diethyl

2,4,5-trioxocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate

under

acidic

conditions. 13C{1H} NMR inverse-gated spectroscopy of the sublimed HCD indicated
contamination with oxalic acid (δC = 161.0 ppm, 11%, see Figure S2 and S3), which presumably
arose from the aqueous hydrolysis of unreacted diethyl oxalate, and co-sublimes with HCD.
Nonetheless, the crude HCD could be smoothly tribrominated using an excess of bromine in
chloroform at 60°C, providing pure TBHCD after concentration and recrystallisation from
chloroform. The 13C NMR spectrum of the obtained colourless needles supported our preexisting tentative structural assignment of TBHCD11 and was unambiguously confirmed by XRay crystallography (see Figures 1B, 1C and S1).11 The enolic form was confirmed by the O4

longer C–O bond length, the planarity of the C5 ring, and the shortness of the C3–C4 bond
compared to the rest of the C–C bonds. The mass spectrum was also consistent with previous
reports.11,14 Characterization data were consistent with a high-purity substance.

Analytical method development, validation and sample analysis
Considering its volatility, a large-volume direct-injection method was developed to avoid
TBHCD losses during evaporation (Table S1). A mixed-mode weak-anion-exchange/RPLC
separation enabled retention of strongly polar analytes with a pH gradient to deactivate the
ion exchange functionality later in the run. A quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer was
operated with narrow-scan windows (0.1 Da) to maximise detector sensitivity. Method
performance was evaluated according to Eurachem guidelines.21 Excellent limits of
quantification were determined at 4 and 10 ng L-1 for TBHCD and DBMSA with linearity
verified up to 2,637 and 10,560 ng L-1, respectively (R2 >0.995, N≥10). In comparison, the only
previously reported limit of detection for TBHCD was 530 ng L-1.14 Repeatability at high and
low spiking level returned relative standard deviations (%RSD) of the area ≤3% for both
substances (n=10). Matrix effect from tap water suppressed the signal on average 1% for
TBHCD and 8% for DBMSA (n=10, %RSD=2% for areas of both compounds).
As no analyte-free tap water could be retrieved, standard addition was preferentially
adopted to account for matrix effects. Calibration with a minimum of five standards returned
coefficients of determination of R2>0.995 (satisfying requirements set by all available
guidance).22-25 Municipal water from seven homes in London were sampled every two weeks
for a total of six weeks (sampling coordinates and dates in Table S2, results in Table S3). Mean
concentrations were 122 and 326 ng L-1 for TBHCD and DBMSA, respectively (see Figure 2 for
details of individual sampling points).

Chlorinated HMSAs and HHCDs were semi-quantified employing DBMSA and TBHCD
as reference materials, respectively, which shared structural and chromatographic retention
time similarity, and in line with other works.26 The mean semi-quantitative concentrations of
DCMSA and BCMSA were 3164 and 1164 ng L-1, in line with concentrations found in tap water
samples from Europe, Asia and America.13 BDCHCD, CDBHCD and TCHCD were semiquantified respectively at 150, 286 and 138 ng L-1 on average. Although monitoring only seven
homes, these were spread across London and on multiple occasions. Extracted ion
chromatograms for all analytes in a London tap water sample are available in Figure S6. These
results indicate potential widespread occurrence of all analytes in London municipal waters.
Given the impossibility to account for TBHCD differential degradation due to variable
residence time in the pipeline, it is not possible at this stage to analyse spatiotemporal trends.
In order to do so, sampling immediately after treatment should be attempted. A more
comprehensive spatiotemporal study is recommended to understand occurrence on a much
larger scale.

Stability and reactivity of TBHCD
A stability study conducted in laboratory tap water (pH=7.8, water treatment: chlorination)
showed that frozen samples could only be considered stable for 24 hours (details in Table S4).
Refrigerated tap water solutions showed a 12% peak area percent (A%) decrease over 24
hours and consequently could not be considered stable. Moreover, very significant
transformation occurred at room temperature (RT) in tap water (85% decrease in 24 hours).
These results shall be considered valid only for the drinking water composition tested.
Refrigerated ultrapure water solutions were found to be stable for 48 hours.

Odd-electron fragments in electrospray ionisation are rare, mostly occurring in
positive rather than negative mode, generated by stabilization of the radical ion. 27-31 All four
HHCDs detected in samples shared a distinctive fragmentation pattern (see Figure 3A, 3D, 3E
and 3F), which included [M-H-Halogen•]•–, [M-H-Halogen•-CO]•– and [C4HalogenO]– in all
recorded spectra, strongly indicating the presence of an identical structure with different
halogen substituents. As the radical formation is favoured on the sp3-hybridised carbon, in
BDCHCD [M-H-Br•]•– is diagnostic for the position of the bromine, making it a stereocenter.
This unique fragmentation pattern highlights the existence of relatively stable dihalogenated
radical species, suggesting low C-halogen bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) for the
trihalogenated species. The PIS of dibromo-HCD (DBHCD, previously tentatively identified in
drinking water)11 also revealed a fragment with low intensity generated by the neutral loss of
radical bromine (Br•)(Figure 3B).
Other beta-dicarbonyl structures like N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, commonly employed
as an organic synthesis reagent) are a source of Br•.32,33 NBS undergoes slow thermal
homolysis in nitrogen atmosphere and absence of light.34 The BDEs of NBS and of all four
trihalogenated-HCDs were calculated employing a computational protocol that well
reproduces the experimental BDE of NBS (BDEcalculated=67.2 kcal mol-1 -Figure 4A- vs.
BDEexperimental=66.0 ± kcal mol-1)35. The calculated C-Br bond BDE in TBHCD was 52.7 kcal mol1 (Figure 4B), 14.5 kcal mol-1 lower than that of NBS. Pronounced delocalisation of the

unpaired electron (Figures 4C and 5C) is in accordance with the favourable homolytic
cleavage. C-Br BDEs were almost constant for the other brominated species: 52.5 and 52.3
kcal mol-1 for CDBHCD (Figure 4D) and BDCHCD (Figure 4E). These values are also very close
to that of the hydrogen peroxide O-O bond (51.1 kcal mol-1),36,37 a well-known source of radical
species in the body.38 The calculated BDE for the C-Cl bond in TCHCD (Figure 4F) and BDCHCD

(Figure 4E) was 64.9 kcal mol-1, and 65.2 kcal mol-1 for CDBHCD, implying that also the C-Cl
bond cleavage is energetically favourable in comparison to NBS. Furthermore, in the mixed
halogenated compounds, the C-Br bond is cleaved first, in agreement with the fragmentation
observed in Figure 3. Calculated bond dissociation enthalpies and free energies in the gas
phase and in water are reported in Table S5.
The negative charge in all HHCDs is delocalised between oxygens in positions 3 and 5,
and an identical pKa of 4.5 was calculated for all four species with ACD/Labs Percepta software
(Toronto, Ontario). Therefore, they should present primarily in anionic form both in drinking
water and blood. Figure 5B represents resonance and tautomeric structures of deprotonated
DBHCD implying a symmetry axis and exchangeability of C-H hydrogen (the strongest pKa for
DBHCD was calculated at 2.4).
Standards in ultrapure water (UPW) exposed to daylight consistently exhibited
degradation of TBHCD and formation of DBHCD, with a ratio between DBHCD formation and
TBHCD degradation of 0.68 (n=12, %RSD=14%). When exposed to daylight at RT, TBHCD A%
reduced to 73% on average of its initial area in 90 minutes, while an average 17 A% of DBHCD
was formed at the same time (details in Table S6). By comparison, reference solutions left in
the dark at RT during the same interval did not show any statistically significant reduction in
TBHCD or formation of DBHCD (n=6). A compound tentatively identified as 4-bromo-5hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,2,3-trione (BHCT) was also shown to form increasingly with
daylight exposure, with a ratio between its area increase and TBHCD area decrease of 0.13
(n=12, %RSD=21%). In the absence of reference materials, A% of DBHCD and BHCT were
calculated by assuming ionisation efficiencies identical to that of TBHCD. When 100 g mL-1
of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO, a paramagnetic radical scavenger) were
added to UPW, over 90 minutes of daylight exposure TBHCD degradation was decreased by
9

an average of 92%, while DBHCD and BHCT formation was diminished by 81 and 62% on
average, respectively (n=6, %RSD of peak areas ≤15% for all compounds). In acetone and
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) exposed to daylight to investigate hydrogen source for DBHCD
formation, no statistically significant formation of DBHCD was observed (n=6), while the
average BHCT A% reached 4% in acetone and 22% in DMSO over 3 hours. In general, DBHCD
was observed to degrade faster than TBHCD in tap water. In frozen tap water solutions, an
average 47% A% drop was recorded for DBHCD in 24 hours (n=3, %RSD=3%), while no
statistically significant degradation of TBHCD was observed. Therefore, degradation of DBHCD
and TBHCD in drinking water is expected to occur at the same time, but at different rates,
making semi-quantification of DBHCD more challenging and outside the scope of this initial
work.
While no statistically significant degradation was observed at pH 4 and at a
physiologically relevant pH of 7.4 during two hours at RT in the dark, at pH 8.5 and 9 the
compound clearly degraded forming both DBHCD and BHCT, at a rate that increased with
increasing pH (%RSD<15% over triplicate preparations for all compounds, details in Table S7).
TBHCD average A% dropped to 81% within 2 hours at pH 8.5, and to 58% within 2 hours at pH
9. Acidification of a spiked tap water sample at pH 5 did not result in improved TBHCD sample
stability at RT in the dark: in 24 hours the A% decreased by over 99% on average, ruling out
the possibility of prolonged sample stability by acidification. When 100 g mL-1 of TEMPO
were added to UPW solutions adjusted at pH 9, over 2 hours of storage in the dark at RT,
TBHCD degradation decreased by an average of 70%, while DBHCD and BHCT formation also
decreased by 67 and 62% on average, respectively. (n=6, %RSD of the areas ≤15% for all
compounds). These results clearly indicate that TBHCD degradation induced by both light and
alkaline conditions involves the formation of a radical pair. Radical anions are well-known to
10

react with water with mechanisms involving proton and electron transfer.39,40 As well as lightinduced homolysis, light-induced heterolysis has been shown to proceed through the
formation of geminate radical pairs.41 Our results are in accordance with the notion that
TEMPO promotes recombination of radical pairs via spin-exchange,42 and scavenges free
radicals with a rate is inversely proportional to the radical’s stability.43 The mechanisms of
DBHCD and BHCT formation remain to be determined.
A small reduction in HHCD formation was reported in simulated drinking water by Pan
et al14 at pH 8.5 in comparison to pH 6.0 in presence of bromide. Our results suggest that the
degradation rate is faster in alkaline conditions. Hypochlorous acid has a pKa of 7.40, and is a
much stronger oxidant in its protonated form.44 Similarly, hypobromous acid is a much
stronger oxidant in its protonated form, but has a higher pKa of 8.55.44 Hypochlorous acid
oxidises bromide to hypobromous acid. Therefore, while at pH 6 we expect both hypochlorous
and hypobromous acid to be primarily in their most oxidizing form, at pH 8.5 only a small
quantity of hypobromous acid should be active. They also report an increase in HHCD
formation by prolonging the contact time from 1 hour to 5 days with chlorinamination, and a
decrease in HHCD formation over the same period with chlorination. However, at 5 days of
exposure to chlorine, TBHCD was the only species visible. In ozonation/chlorination and
ozonation/chloramination treatment, Han et al reported decreasing intensities of HHCD with
increasing ozone does.17 Increasing ozone doses are likely to augment the oxidation of
hypobromous acid to bromate, limiting the formation of brominated HCDs. Ozone could also
react with aromatic precursors of HHCDs, limiting their availability to form both chlorinated
and brominated HCDs.45 A much higher proportion of bromine HCD substitution was reported
for ozonation/chlorination in comparison to ozonation/chloramination. It is important to
highlight that TBHCD stability in test solutions must be taken into consideration to accurately
11

evaluate experimental formation/degradation. The reaction pathways and kinetic of
degradation of TBHCD in drinking water remain to be demonstrated as part of future research
projects, requiring synthesis on a much larger scale (including radioisotopes and/or stable
isotope containing test materials). To date, it cannot be excluded that the TBHCD reactivity in
treated water could derive from its electrophilicity rather than from its tendency to homolyse.

Bacterial mutagenicity tests (Salmonella/microsome assay)
The mutagenicity of TBHCD and DBMSA was investigated with a Salmonella/microsome assay,
the most common procedure for routine mutagenicity testing of chemicals,46 and widely
employed for DBPs.5 For this study the following strains were employed: TA98, sensitive to
frameshift mutagens,47 TA100, sensitive base substitutions, and TA102, developed to detect
genetic damage caused by radicals.48 We found that TBHCD causes induction of His+ revertants
at doses > 100/plate in all three tester strains (Figure 6, individual values in Table 8A), in
absence of metabolic activation mix. The highest concentration (500 µg/plate) caused acute
toxicity (dissolved background lawn) which was paralleled by a decline of the revertant
numbers. The most pronounced effect was detected in TA100 (6.6) followed by TA98 (6.2) and
TA102 (2.2) (numbers in parenthesis indicate mutant ratios, i.e. chemically induced revertants
versus background rates). Addition of metabolic activation mix (rat liver S-9) led to a decrease
of the mutagenic activity by ~50 % (Figure 6). No evidence of mutagenic activity of DBMSA
under identical conditions was detected. (See Figure S4). Limited substance availability did not
allow for DBMSA testing with metabolic activation in strains TA98 and TA102. The decline of
formation of His+ revertants after addition of the metabolic activation mix (which is added in
in vitro mutagenicity tests to mimic the activation of certain indirectly-acting promutagens)49
was also observed in earlier experiments with halogenated DBPs,50,51 and is probably a

consequence of direct reactions of the test compound with molecules contained in the mix.
However, certain brominated compounds are activated by the mix 52. Most known
halogenated DBPs cause base substitution mutations and are by far more active in TA100 than
in other strains.9 We found that TBHCD causes also mutations TA98 and TA102 under very
similar conditions. This indicates that the compound causes DNA damage via molecular
mechanisms which are different from other halogenated DBPs. It must be noted that, while
mutagenic activity was detected at dozens/hundreds of g/plate, concentrations in drinking
water are several orders of magnitude lower in the ng L-1 range. Obviously, no risk can be
inferred as this test is not quantitative, and comprehensive risk assessment should be
performed.
It must be noted that, at this stage, the formation of Br• cannot be assumed to be
responsible for the observed bacterial mutagenicity and further work is certainly required, in
particular to assess the electrophilic reactivity of TBHCD with DNA. However, formation of Br•
is expected with light exposure and could occur in the body.38 Hypochlorous acid is also a
known mutagen53 and a potential source of radical chlorine with slightly higher BDE than the
one here calculated for TBHCD.36 However, hypochlorous acid quickly reacts as an electrophile
in drinking water.54 NBS, reported in this work as a reference for Br• formation potential, is
mutagenic in Salmonella/microsome tests (Source: European Chemicals Agency,
http://echa.europa.eu/, consulted on the 30th August 2023). Furthermore, NBS was shown to
generate genotoxic DNA interstrand cross-links connecting 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine to an
opposite base.55 Br• is scavenged by dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bicarbonate, forming
hydroxylated species rather than brominated ones in micropollutants degradation studies,56
and in general reacting with antioxidant DOM by electron transfer forming bromide, rather
than brominated organic species.57 The reaction of Br• with phenol, a compound

representative of common DOM moieties, yields mainly para-benzoquinone,58 a known
mutagen59 and carcinogen.60,61 Furthermore, Br• is believed to be involved in the oxidation of
guanine, responsible for renal carcinogenesis induced by bromate.62

Conclusions
The previously unassessed mutagenicity and the unique reactivity of an emerging class of
DBPs in drinking water is reported for the first time. Following successful synthesis and
purification of TBHCD, 13C NMR and X-ray crystallography data were recorded, leading to the
previously unavailable confirmation of the structure as 2,2,4-tribromo-5-hydroxycyclopent-4ene-1,3-dione. We showed that TBHCD undergoes degradation induced by both light and
alkaline pH, at rates that can be significantly reduced by addition of TEMPO, clearly indicating
the formation of a radical pair. Furthermore, the computationally-derived BDE for C-Br was
14.5 kcal mol-1 lower for TBHCD than N-Br in NBS. Chlorinated HHCDs showed also lower BDEs
than NBS, clearly indicating their potential to undergo homolysis in drinking water and in the
body. A much larger-scale synthesis campaign is now required to comprehensively define the
reactivity of trihalogenated-HCDs in drinking water and in the human body, e.g. employing
radiolabelling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments.
TBHCD was found to be unstable in frozen drinking water, and therefore constitutes a
significant analytical challenge, as testing must be performed shortly after sample collection.
Post-potabilisation conditions (residual chlorine, residence time etc.) are therefore likely to
greatly influence the concentration of TBHCD at the point-of-use. For the first time, a sensitive
method for TBHCD quantification was developed, validated and applied, revealing average

BDCHCD and TCHCD were semiquantified at higher concencentrations on average. A much
larger analytical campaign is now required to assess population exposure at scale.
TBHCD was shown herein to be a potent mutagen in the Salmonella/microsome assay
in strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. Despite results of bacterial experiments cannot be
employed directly for human risk assessment, genetic damage is one of the hallmarks of
human cancer,8 and therefore these observations indicate that human exposure may lead to
adverse effects. No mutagenic activity was detected for DBMSA. However, in consideration
of their predicted developmental toxicity, the widespread occurrence of DBMSA at hundreds
of ng L-1, and the estimated concentrations of DCMSA and BCMSA at µg L-1 levels should
warrant further confirmatory toxicological investigations into these compounds.
This work is a multidisciplinary effort prompted by NTA results, where toxicity was predicted
in silico for emerging chemical contaminants. Synthesis, exposure quantification and in vitro
toxicity testing are resource-intensive but indispensable steps to bridge the water exposome
knowledge gap and ultimately gain comprehensive control over exposure to harmful
substance via drinking water.

Methods

Synthesis of 4-hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione
Potassium (2.0 g, 51 mmol) was added under nitrogen atmosphere to anhydrous ethanol (8.9
mL, 150 mmol) in diethyl ether (50 mL) at 0°C (not stirred until complete potassium
solubilisation). Diethyl oxalate (3.4 mL, 25 mmol) was added, giving a yellow homogeneous
solution, followed by diethyl-1,3-acetonedicarboxylate (4.7 mL, 26 mmol) which resulted in a
deep orange solution. Within minutes, the entire reaction mixture solidified. After 18 h, the

solid jelly-like substance was dissolved in 2 M aqueous sulfuric acid (200 mL) and extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 200 mL). The combined organics were dried with anhydrous
magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude orange oil of diethyl
2,4,5-trioxocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate (6.6 g), that gradually solidified and was used
without further purification. Crude diester (1.3 g) was dissolved in 12 M aqueous hydrochloric
acid (100 mL) and the resulting orange solution was heated to 100°C for 90 min, during which
it turned brown. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool and the solution was concentrated
in vacuo to give a brown residue. This residue was then dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator
at RT. Over the course of two days, the brown residue was sublimed at 120°C under a static
vacuum of 0.1 mbar to give 4-hydroxycyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione (134 mg, 1.09 mmol, 22%)
as off-white crystals contaminated with oxalic acid (11%).

Analytical method
A large-volume (50 µL) direct-injection method was developed on a Shimadzu LCMS9030 LCQTOF with Nexera XR LC system and standard electrospray ionisation source (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan). A Waters Atlantis Premier BEH C18 AX column (2.5 μm, 2.1 x 100 mm) was employed
for gradient LC, with a 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution in water (adjusted to pH 6.9
with acetic acid) as mobile phase A, and a 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution in
acetonitrile:ultrapure water 9:1 (adjusted to pH 8.9 with diethylamine before organic solvent
addition). Method performance was evaluated employing laboratory tap water (containing
132 and 560 ng L-1 respectively of TBHCD and DBMSA) and following procedure for sample
preparation described below. Linearity was assessed in laboratory tap water spiked at 13
concentrations ranging from 10 to 10,000 ng L-1. Repeatability was tested in a sample spiked
at 50 and 1000 ng L-1 (n=10 for each concentration). Matrix interference was tested comparing
background-corrected spiked laboratory tap water to a standard prepared in ultrapure water
(solutions fortified at 500 ng L-1, n=10). As no samples with low concentration of the analytes
could be retrieved, ultrapure water spiked at 50 ng L-1 was employed to evaluate limits of
quantification for both compounds in compliance with paragraph 6.2.2 of the Eurachem
Guidelines21 (n=10).

Samples were collected in Lightsafe 15 mL centrifuge tubes from seven household
drinking water taps in London (GPS location in Table S2), frozen immediately after collection,
and analysed within 24 hours. Immediately after thawing, tubes were centrifuged at 3000
rpm and 900 µL were transferred to amber glass vials. 100 µL of water:methanol 1:1 solutions
containing the analytes at concentration ranging from 0 to 10000 ng L-1 were added,
generating solutions fortified at 0, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 ng L-1 for standard addition
quantification of TBHCD and DBMSA. The amber vials were then immediately transferred to
the LC autosampler at 4°C for analysis. BDCHCD, CDBHCD and TBHCD were semi-quantified
on the basis of the ratio between their peak areas and that of TBHCD in unspiked samples.26
An identical procedure was adopted to semi-quantify DCMSA and BCMSA employing DBMSA
as a reference.

Stability and reactivity assessment
Compound stability was evaluated over 24 and 48 hours to observe potential degradation of
TBHCD in municipal water samples at room temperature (20 °C), 4°C and -18°C, as well as in
standards in ultrapure water at 4°C. Laboratory tap water and UPW were fortified with 500 ng
L-1 and transferred to amber LC vials, immediately stored under each condition (n=3, injected
in duplicate). Twenty four-hour stability at room temperature of unspiked tap water adjusted
to pH 5 with acetic acid was later assessed with the same procedure. A 1000 ng L-1 TBHCD
solution in UPW was employed to evaluate photostability of TBHCD, monitoring degradation
in clear glass vials left in natural light at room temperature and sampled in duplicate at
intervals of 15 minutes for 90 minutes. Reference vials in amber glass left at room temperature
in the dark were sampled every 30 minutes during the same time interval (n=6) and employed
to evaluate degradation not ascribable to photodegradation. For all experiments in this

section, variations lower than two times the area standard deviation of multiple injections of
reference solutions (N≥6) were deemed to be not statistically significant. DBHCD and BHCT
formation was approximated as A% in comparison to that of TBHCD at time zero, as their
relative ionisation efficiencies could not be determined. Identical preparations containing
TBHCD at 1000 ng L-1 with and without the addition of 100 g mL-1 of TEMPO were compared
after 90 minutes of exposure to natural light (n=6). Duplicate 20 g L-1 solutions prepared in
acetone and DMSO were exposed to natural light for 1, 2 and 3 hours and compared after 20fold dilution in water (n=6 for each solvent).
To evaluate pH stability, triplicate 1000 ng L-1 solutions were prepared in ultrapure
water adjusted to pH 4 with acetic acid, to pH 8.5 and 9 with ammonium hydroxide, and in a
10 mM phosphate buffer adjusted at pH 7.4 with ammonium hydroxide. Solutions were
compared to standards in ultrapure water at the same concentration and injected after 1 and
2 hours of storage in the dark at RT (six preparations in total for each pH value). Identical
preparations at pH 9 containing TBHCD at 1000 ng L-1, with and without the addition of 100
g mL-1 of TEMPO, were compared after 2 hours of storage at RT in the dark (n=6).
To calculate BDEs, geometry optimisations of the systems were carried out at the
B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, using

Gaussian16 (revision C.01).63 Frequency

calculation resulted in no imaginary frequencies for all the minima confirming the nature of
the critical points. BDE calculations from the optimized structures were carried out using the
G3B3 procedure.64

Salmonella/microsome assay
Plate incorporation assays were conducted as described in the protocol of Maron and Ames,65
employing for both TBHCD and DBMSA strains TA98 and TA102 without metabolic activation

mix (S9), and TA100 (with and without S-9). Characterisation of the strains (uvrB, rfa, pKM101
and pAQ1) was performed before the main experiments.59 Positive and negative controls were
included in all individual series. A response was considered positive when the mean number
of revertant colonies was two-fold or higher the one of the negative control (“two fold rule”).43
TBHCD and DBMSA were tested in plate incorporation assays and were dissolved in a mix of
DMSO and water (1:2). Incubation was conducted in the dark. For each experimental point
three plates were tested in parallel. 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (0.1 µg/plate) was used as a
positive control for TA98 and caused 1061±201 revertants per plate. Sodium azide (1.5
µg/plate) was used as a positive control for TA100 (without S9) and caused 636±62 revertants
per plate. 2-aminoantracene (2.0 µg/plate) was used in experiments employing TA100 with
metabolic activation and induced 1102.0±75 revertants per plate. Methyl methanesulphonate
(2 µg/plate) was used as a positive control for TA102 and caused 2067±153 revertants per
plate.
