Abstract
Microbial hydrogen production presents a compelling alternative to conventional methods
such as steam methane reforming and electrolysis, offering the potential for low-energy,
carbon-conscious fuel generation. This theoretical study proposes a dual-stage hydrogen
production system utilizing genetically optimized strains of Clostridium butyricum and
Rhodobacter sphaeroides within a vertically integrated bioreactor. The system is designed to
maximize hydrogen recovery through sequential dark fermentation and photofermentation,
leveraging glucose as the primary substrate and water as an additional electron source.
Stoichiometric modelling of the full metabolic cycle predicts a hydrogen yield of 12 mol H₂
per mol of glucose, representing the complete recovery of all hydrogen atoms available
from the substrate and water. This equates to 13.45% yield by glucose mass, or 8.41%
when including water input. The design includes membrane-based gas separation and
redirection of CO₂ emissions to biological sinks such as sugarcane plantations, bamboo
forests, and algae bioreactors to enhance sustainability and carbon offset potential.
While experimental validation is pending, this model establishes an upper-bound theoretical
framework for microbial hydrogen recovery and CO₂ integration. Emphasis is placed on
idealized assumptions regarding enzyme function, microbial conversion efficiency, and gas
capture. The results are intended to guide future research into scalable, decentralized
biohydrogen platforms aligned with global climate goals.
(This model defines an idealized performance ceiling and includes realism-adjusted
scenarios using expression and membrane correction factors.)

Author’s Note: While this paper maintains a formal structure throughout, certain sections
include personal reflections to transparently highlight the limitations and human
considerations behind the model.
Regarding System Clarity: This paper presents a theoretical framework and does not include
structural schematics, reactor diagrams, or CAD-level fabrication plans. The dual-stage
metabolic system is described through stoichiometric equations, kinetic approximations, and
structured yield modelling. While physical layout diagrams are excluded, all system
components—fermentative stages, metabolic routing, gas separation, and CO₂ redirection—
are captured via theoretical modelling. As this is a conceptual design, schematic
representations are deferred to future experimental or engineering-focused work once
biological viability is established.

1. Introduction
The transition to clean and sustainable energy sources remains one of the most urgent
scientific challenges of the 21st century. Hydrogen has emerged as a promising candidate
due to its high energy content and zero-emission profile at the point of use. However, current
industrial hydrogen production methods—most notably steam methane reforming (SMR)—
are carbon-intensive, heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and contribute substantially to
greenhouse gas emissions. While water electrolysis offers a cleaner alternative, it is
hindered by high energy requirements and dependence on renewable electricity
infrastructure, limiting its scalability—particularly in regions with limited access to renewable
energy systems.
Biological hydrogen production through microbial fermentation has gained increasing
attention as a low-energy, renewable pathway. Specific strains such as Clostridium
butyricum and Rhodobacter sphaeroides can convert organic substrates into hydrogen gas
under anaerobic conditions. Dark fermentation using C. butyricum can rapidly degrade
sugars like glucose into hydrogen and volatile fatty acids, while photofermentation by R.
sphaeroides enables the further conversion of these acids—particularly butyric and acetic
acid—into additional hydrogen using light energy. In addition to carbon-based substrates,
water molecules serve as critical electron donors during photofermentation, providing the
oxygen atoms released as carbon dioxide and the protons required for sustained hydrogen
generation.
Despite their promise, single-stage microbial systems are typically limited by incomplete
substrate utilization, accumulation of metabolic byproducts, and suboptimal hydrogen yields.
This paper proposes a dual-stage hydrogen production model that integrates genetically
optimized strains of C. butyricum and R. sphaeroides in a vertically structured bioreactor. By
coupling dark fermentation with downstream photofermentation, the system aims to
maximize hydrogen recovery from both glucose and its metabolic derivatives. Genetic
modifications are introduced to enhance hydrogenase activity, reduce competing metabolic
fluxes, and improve light harvesting under low-intensity conditions.
In addition to yield optimization, the system incorporates a membrane-based gas separation
unit to extract and isolate carbon dioxide produced during fermentation. Rather than storing
or releasing this CO₂, the model proposes redirecting it to external biological systems—such
as algae bioreactors, sugarcane plantations, or bamboo forests—for natural carbon
sequestration and glucose regeneration. This combined approach aims to support the
development of a decentralized, low-emission hydrogen production platform that aligns with
global sustainability goals.
This study not only proposes a theoretical biohydrogen system but also introduces a timeresolved kinetic modelling framework to simulate microbial reaction rates and predict realtime behaviour. Additionally, it incorporates a carbon sequestration strategy via highefficiency C₄ crop integration, allowing passive redirection of emitted CO₂ into a sugarcanebased sink. These elements collectively enhance the model's viability for real-world
deployment.

2. Methodology and Theoretical Modelling Framework
This study employs a layered theoretical modelling approach to simulate microbial hydrogen
production via a genetically optimized dual-stage fermentation system. As the model is
conceptual and not experimentally validated, the methodology emphasizes stoichiometric
yield estimation, metabolic pathway design, kinetic approximation, and energy budgeting
under idealized constraints. The following components define the modelling framework:

2.1. Stoichiometric Modelling
Hydrogen yield predictions are derived from balanced metabolic equations for Clostridium
butyricum (dark fermentation) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (photofermentation). Mass- and
mole-based hydrogen outputs are calculated using standard molar masses under complete
substrate conversion assumptions.

2.2. Genetic Engineering Assumptions
Proposed genetic modifications are modelled as fully functional and chromosomally
integrated. Edits such as overexpression of hydrogenases and metabolic enzymes or gene
knockouts are based on documented literature. The model assumes no expression
instability, mutation, or metabolic burden, representing best-case functional performance.

2.3. Bioreactor Design Assumptions
The reactor is conceptualized as a vertically integrated, gravity-assisted dual-chamber
system with scaffold-supported microbial biofilms. Mass transfer of VFAs between stages is
passive. Each chamber operates under fixed environmental conditions (anaerobic,
temperature-stabilized), with light access provided for the photofermentative stage. Uniform
biofilm structure, metabolite diffusion, and chamber isolation are assumed.

2.4. Kinetic Approximations
Microbial activity is modelled using Monod kinetics for glucose consumption and lightsaturation kinetics for photofermentation. Empirical constants are adapted from published
literature. These models provide time-based performance insights but are not calibrated to
experimental data.
Important Note on Hydrogen Feedback Inhibition:
While this model simulates microbial kinetics under ideal extraction conditions, it does not
account for enzymatic inhibition due to hydrogen accumulation in the reactor headspace.
Literature reports show that hydrogenase and nitrogenase activity in C. butyricum and R.
sphaeroides respectively are suppressed at H₂ partial pressures >0.6–0.8 atm. This
inhibition can significantly reduce gas output in poorly ventilated systems. Future kinetic
models should incorporate dynamic headspace gas modelling and feedback inhibition
thresholds for accurate time-course prediction.

2.5. Energy and Cost Calculations
Energy requirements for illumination, gas extraction, and basic control systems are
estimated using power consumption values from typical lab-scale equipment. Hydrogen
output energy is calculated using the combustion enthalpy of H₂ (286 kJ/mol). Cost analysis
is based on U.S. bulk pricing for glucose, amortized component use, and power rates,
reflecting theoretical minimums.
(All pricing references are based on pre-2020 U.S. bulk rates, before tariff-induced market
distortions introduced under Trump’s presidency. This ensures pricing reflects commodity
baselines unaffected by policy-driven inflation.)

2.6. Gas Separation and CO₂ Routing
A vacuum-assisted membrane system is modelled with perfect hydrogen/CO₂ separation
efficiency, no fouling, and lossless operation. Separated CO₂ is routed to sugarcane-based
sinks via passive or root-zone injection. Biological sinks are assumed to operate at full
fixation capacity with no lag or underperformance.
Author’s Note on Electrochemical Capture Alternatives:
During the modelling phase, I reviewed electrochemical CO₂ capture approaches such as
the fluoflavine-based FFDS redox system [Wei et al., 2025], which offers oxygen-tolerant
operation and reversible capture via pH-swing chemistry. While conceptually interesting, I
found the overall energy-to-capture ratio and CO₂ managing cycle to be suboptimal for
integration into this system. In particular, the reliance on high energy input without a built-in
utilization path renders it inefficient when compared to biological fixation strategies.
Therefore, this model intentionally favours photosynthetically active CO₂ sinks—namely
sugarcane plantations and algae bioreactors—which not only sequester CO₂ passively but
regenerate glucose substrates for further biohydrogen production. Unless future work
demonstrates a tightly coupled valorisation pathway for electrochemically captured CO₂, I
consider this class of sorbents unsuitable for the present system.

2.7. Scope Limitations
This framework assumes ideal substrate purity, enzyme functionality, membrane integrity,
and microbial behaviour. Stochastic variability, environmental drift, and hardware
degradation are not included. These simplifications serve to define a theoretical upper-bound
system performance.
This section consolidates the modelling strategies underlying the theoretical framework,
ensuring clarity and reproducibility for future studies. While certain sections of the paper
include personal reflections to contextualize design constraints, the scientific modelling
remains rigorous and idealized for conceptual benchmarking.

2.8. Assumptions Tiers and Realism Factors
To clearly delineate the scope of this theoretical model, all system assumptions are
categorized by domain and impact severity. While idealized conditions are necessary to
establish a performance ceiling, this section outlines the tiers of assumptions applied and
proposes adjustments for more realistic modelling.

To account for biological and engineering variability, the Biological Realism Factor (BRF) is
introduced as a global modifier. This factor adjusts theoretical hydrogen yields and gas
separation performance downward based on expected losses in enzyme expression,
cofactor depletion, metabolic burden, and system wear.
Typical BRF values based on published microbial expression data range from 0.75 to 0.90,
depending on strain, expression system, and cultivation duration. All future yield, energy, and
cost calculations in this paper can be scaled using this factor to reflect more realistic
operating envelopes.
All core values can be scaled by the BRF for realism-adjusted estimates. Tables in Sections
9 and 14 reflect uncorrected theoretical ceilings; adjusted versions appear alongside them
for realistic comparison.
The tiered structure also supports future scenario modelling—allowing researchers to
evaluate system resilience under degraded conditions, such as partial membrane failure,
incomplete VFA conversion, or temporary CO₂ sink inoperability.

3. Biochemical Pathways and Theoretical Yield Modelling
Hydrogen production through microbial metabolism is driven by a series of enzymatically
regulated biochemical pathways, with stoichiometric constraints that define the theoretical
maximum yields achievable from specific substrates. This section models the metabolic
pathways of two key microorganisms—Clostridium butyricum and Rhodobacter
sphaeroides—within the context of a dual-stage fermentation system. Yield calculations are
based on molar balances and mass conversions to assess the energy potential and gas
output of the proposed design.

3.1. Dark Fermentation Pathway (Clostridium butyricum)
Dark fermentation is an anaerobic process wherein glucose is catabolized to yield hydrogen
gas, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), primarily butyric and acetic acids. The
simplified stoichiometric reaction is as follows:

C6H12O6 → C4H8O2 + 2CO2 + 2H2
3.1.1. Theoretical Hydrogen Yield Calculation:
•

Molar mass of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆): 180.16 g/mol

•

Molar mass of hydrogen (H₂): 2.02 g/mol

•

2 mol H2 = 4.04 g hydrogen per mole glucose

•

Yield by mass = (180.16) × 100 ≈ 𝟐. 𝟐𝟒%

4.04

Key Enzymes:
•

Glycolysis: Glucose → Pyruvate

•

Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase: Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA + CO₂ + reduced
ferredoxin

•

[FeFe]-Hydrogenase: Reduced ferredoxin → H₂

3.2. Photofermentation Pathway (Rhodobacter sphaeroides)
In the second stage, R. sphaeroides photoferments VFAs under anaerobic, light-activated
conditions to produce additional hydrogen. A representative reaction using butyric acid is:

C4H8O2 + 6H2O + Light → 10H2 + 4CO2
The representative stoichiometric reaction for photofermentation used in this model reflects
the complete oxidation of butyric acid under idealized conditions. This formulation aligns with
theoretical yields reported in prior photofermentation studies, where yields of up to 10 mol H₂
per mol of butyrate have been proposed based on full hydrogen atom recovery from both the
substrate and water-derived protons. Notably, studies by Ghosh and Hallenbeck (2010) and
Nath & Das (2004) support theoretical ceilings in the 8–10 mol H₂ range when nitrogenase is
fully activated and substrate inhibition is minimal. These values serve as a theoretical upper
limit and are not typically achieved in practical systems, where reported yields range from
5.6 to 7.8 mol H₂/mol butyrate due to cofactor limitations, metabolic branching, and photon
attenuation.

3.2.1. Theoretical Hydrogen Yield Calculation:
•

Molar mass of butyric acid (C₄H₈O₂): 88.11 g/mol

•

10 mol H₂ = 20.2 g hydrogen per mole butyric acid

•

Total mass input = 88.11 + 108.09 = 196.2 g

•

Yield percentage = (196.2) × 100 ≈ 𝟏𝟎. 𝟐𝟗% by mass

20.2

Key Components:
•

Light-harvesting complexes (LH1, LH2)

•

Nitrogenase enzyme (light activated, ATP-dependant)

•

Electron donors: reduced Ferredoxin and NAD(P)H

Side Note: While the yield of 10 mol H₂ per mol butyric acid represents the full theoretical
recovery of all hydrogen atoms, experimental photofermentation systems commonly achieve
yields between 5.6 and 7.8 mol H₂ per mol substrate due to energy losses, biomass
generation, and metabolic branch pathways [2,3]. This model assumes full oxidation as a
theoretical ceiling and excludes these real-world constraints.
Real-World Photofermentation Ceiling Adjustment
While the 10 mol H₂ per mol butyrate value used in this model aligns with theoretical
maximums reported in prior photofermentation studies [Ghosh & Hallenbeck, 2010; Nath &
Das, 2004], real-world yields are consistently lower due to kinetic constraints, light
attenuation, cofactor scarcity, and regulatory bottlenecks. Most experimental setups report
practical ranges of 5.6–7.8 mol H₂/mol butyrate under optimized but realistic conditions.
To reflect this discrepancy, a corrected yield range is proposed below. These values can be
used to recalibrate energy output, system efficiency, and CO₂ generation when evaluating
real-world deployment scenarios:

This yield gradient reinforces the importance of integrating Biological Realism Factor (BRF)
and cofactor correction layers into all performance metrics, rather than relying solely on
stoichiometric ceilings. Future reactor designs should benchmark against the 7 mol case
unless continuous light optimization and genetic stabilization are proven experimentally.

3.3. Overall Hydrogen Yield from One Cycle
Assuming complete substrate conversion in both stages:
From 1 mol of glucose and 6 mol of water, the system yields a total of 12 mol of hydrogen—
recovering 6 mol from glucose-derived metabolites and 6 mol from water-derived protons via
photofermentation. This distribution reflects full hydrogen recovery from both the substrate
and external electron donor sources. This corresponds to mass-based yields of 13.45%
relative to glucose alone, and 8.41% when water input is included. Presenting both molar
and mass-based values provides clarity on yield interpretation across biochemical and
engineering contexts.
Side note: This yield assumes full constructive collaboration across all genetic edits.
Applying a GSCF of 0.75–0.9 reduces this to 9–10.8 mol under more realistic gene stack
limits.
H2 Volume Clarification:
All hydrogen volume calculations throughout this model assume Standard Temperature
and Pressure (STP) conditions—specifically, 1 atm pressure and 273.15 K (0°C). Under
these parameters, one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 litres. Thus, the 12 mol H₂ yield
per cycle corresponds to approximately 268.97 litres of gas at STP. This value scales
linearly with reactor operation and can be recalculated for non-STP conditions using the
ideal gas law (PV = nRT). All real-world volume estimates should incorporate system
temperature and backpressure to avoid yield inflation.

Side Note: Glucose alone could at most yield 6 mol H₂ if fully oxidized for its 12 H atoms.
The additional 6 mol in this model derive from photobiological water splitting.

3.4. CO2 Generation Summary
•

Dark fermentation: 2 mol CO2

•

Photofermentation: 4 mol CO2

•

Total = 6 mol CO2 per mol glucose

•

Molar mass of CO2 = 44.01 g/mol

•

Total CO2 mass = 264.06 g per cycle

•

CO2-to-glucose mass ratio = 146.56%

Clarification on Carbon Flow and CO₂ Mass Output:
The CO₂-to-glucose mass ratio of 146.56% reflects not an increase in carbon atoms, but
rather the combined effects of complete substrate oxidation and the incorporation of
oxygen atoms from water during photofermentation. Under ideal conditions, all six carbon
atoms from glucose are oxidized—two during dark fermentation and four during
photofermentation—yielding 6 mol of CO₂.
However, when biomass diversion occurs (modelled via the Biomass Diversion Factor,
BDF), a fraction of glucose-derived carbon is retained in microbial biomass instead of being
oxidized. Since CO₂ production is tightly coupled to substrate oxidation—particularly in
photofermentation—this diversion results in a direct reduction in CO₂ output and, by
extension, a proportional drop in H₂ yield.
Therefore, this 146.56% ratio applies only under idealized, full-oxidation scenarios. In
realistic systems, both CO₂ evolution and hydrogen production will decline according to the
degree of biomass carbon retention.

3.5. Substrate Input Modelling and Real-World Substitution (Clostridium)
The hydrogen production efficiency of the dark fermentation stage depends directly on the
availability of fermentable sugars. In this system, Clostridium butyricum operates as the
primary anaerobic fermenter, converting sugars into hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs).
To maintain continuous biohydrogen production, glucose feeding must ideally match the
metabolic capacity of the biomass. The following assumptions are made under idealized
conditions of substrate availability, metabolic activity, and conversion efficiency.
Biomass-Specific Glucose Consumption Rate
From literature and validated fermentation data:
•

Specific glucose uptake rate of Clostridium butyricum (qs) ≈ 10 mmol/g biomass/hr

•

Molar mass of glucose (C6H12O6) = 180.16 g/mol

27.02 𝑔/ℎ𝑟 × 24 ℎ𝑟 = 648.48 𝑔/𝑑𝑎𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑙𝑢𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑒
Thus, assuming consistent uptake over a 24-hour cycle, a 1 L Clostridium chamber
operating at 15 g/L biomass would theoretically require approximately 648 g of glucose per
day.
Sugarcane Extract as a Substrate
To simulate real-world conditions, laboratory-grade glucose can be substituted with
sugarcane extract, a cost-effective and renewable carbohydrate source.
Average composition of sugarcane extract (assumed):
•

Total sugars: ~15% (150 g/L)

•

Composition: ~75% sucrose, ~12% glucose, ~13% fructose

Given that the Clostridium strain has been genetically modified to metabolize sucrose,
glucose, and fructose, it is assumed that the entire sugar content becomes fermentable
without inhibition or metabolic bottleneck.
Required Volume of Sugarcane Extract
648 𝑔/𝑑𝑎𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑟
= 4.32 𝐿/𝑑𝑎𝑦
150 𝑔/𝑑𝑎𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑒 𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡
Final Estimation (Assumed Conditions)
Under idealized assumptions of full enzymatic activity, no feedback inhibition, and complete
sugar utilization, a 1 L Clostridium reactor with 15 g/L biomass is expected to require:
•

648 g/day of pure glucose, or

•

4.32 L/day of raw sugarcane extract (15% w/v sugar concentration)

This calculation serves as a theoretical baseline for substrate supply and must be adjusted
in practical systems to account for process inefficiencies, microbial adaptation lag, or
variations in sugar concentration and extract purity.

3.6.1. Biomass Diversion Factor (BDF):
In realistic systems, 5–30% of substrate carbon is diverted to microbial biomass, reducing
theoretical gas yield. This model introduces a BDF (Biomass Diversion Factor) to represent
the proportion of substrate unavailable for gas production due to cell growth and
maintenance. BDF-adjusted yield scenarios are presented in Section 8.2.2.
The model assumes full conversion of VFAs to hydrogen, excluding the effects of
accumulation, substrate inhibition, or partial VFA routing into biomass. Future kinetic models
should incorporate substrate conversion efficiency factors (e.g., 80–90%) for more realistic
projections. These genetic modifications are designed with a balance between yield
optimization and metabolic stability in mind. While theoretical in nature, all proposed edits
are based on prior microbial engineering literature and assumed to be achievable using
contemporary gene editing platforms. Further modelling of pathway fluxes and gene
expression regulation would be required in future experimental stages.

Biomass Diversion and Carbon Retention Note:
In practical systems, microbial biomass formation diverts a portion of carbon and reducing
equivalents away from gas production. Each glucose molecule contains six carbon atoms, all
of which are fully oxidized to CO₂ under ideal conditions. However, when cells retain carbon
for growth, fewer carbon atoms are available for CO₂ formation—and by extension, for the
hydrogen-producing oxidation reactions that release them. This coupling between carbon
flow and hydrogen yield is critical; even small diversions (e.g., 10–20% of carbon) can
reduce final hydrogen output by a comparable margin. These effects are quantified in
Section 8.2.2 using the Biomass Diversion Factor (BDF).

4. Genetic Modifications and System Burden Analysis
To maximize hydrogen output, specific genetic modifications are proposed for the microbial
strains Clostridium butyricum and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These edits aim to enhance
hydrogenase activity, suppress competing pathways, expand substrate flexibility, and
increase cofactor and ATP availability. All modifications are assumed to be integrated
chromosomally via CRISPR-Cas9 or homologous recombination techniques, with stable
expression under anaerobic or light-inducible promoters. Potential metabolic burden, redox
imbalances, and long-term evolutionary responses are excluded from the scope of this
model.

4.3. Genetic Integration Challenges and Model Assumptions
Stack Compatibility and Synergy Limitations
While each proposed genetic edit in isolation has been documented to improve hydrogen
yield or metabolic efficiency, the assumption of full functional compatibility across a multigene stack presents a significant risk of overestimation. In real-world systems, combinatorial
gene stacking beyond 3–4 edits frequently result in metabolic crosstalk, resource
exhaustion, and unexpected feedback inhibition.
For facultative anaerobes like Clostridium butyricum and Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
regulatory networks often suppress overexpression to maintain redox balance and cellular
homeostasis. Literature suggests that above 4–5 simultaneous edits, constructive
collaboration tends to plateau—and in some cases, becomes negative due to ribosomal
bottlenecking, cofactor depletion, or transcript interference.
Therefore, while this model includes a 6–8 gene modification set for theoretical
benchmarking, it is explicitly treated as a ceiling scenario. Actual implementation may
require modular optimization or sequential engineering to preserve system stability. Future
modelling efforts should incorporate a constructive collaboration correction factor or
simulate dynamic trade-offs using flux balance or gene regulatory network models to
determine yield inflection points under escalating metabolic burden.
This model assumes these modifications are functionally expressed and do not trigger
regulatory shutdowns or metabolic collapse. These assumptions are made to isolate the
theoretical yield ceiling of optimized microbial strains. Future iterations of the model will need
to incorporate dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA), metabolic burden modelling, or
resource allocation frameworks to refine viability assessments for these engineered
systems.
Similar enhancements in Clostridium spp. and Rhodobacter spp. have achieved 1.8x–3.5x
increases in H₂ yield in batch systems under lab conditions [e.g., Hallenbeck et al., 2009;
McKinlay & Harwood, 2010; Thaiwong et al., 2015]. This model builds upon those pathways
with additional combinatorial edits. While constructive collaboration between these edits has
not been empirically validated as a unified stack, this model assumes compatibility under
optimized cellular conditions.
Based on literature, multi-gene overexpression systems in facultative anaerobes often
experience 10–25% loss in target expression over extended growth due to mutation,
regulatory repression, or resource depletion [ref Hallenbeck, McKinlay]. While the current
model assumes full expression, a Biological Realism Factor (BRF) of 0.75–0.9 can be
used to adjust theoretical rates in future kinetic simulations.
These genetic assumptions define the theoretical design envelope for engineered
biohydrogen systems. While this paper explores the idealized ceiling, future work should
define a performance corridor bounded by expected losses in expression fidelity, cofactor
availability, and adaptive mutagenesis. Such a corridor would allow scenario-based system
planning those accounts for both synthetic potential and biological resistance.

4.4. Gene Stack Resource Load and Metabolic Burden Quantification
While the previous sections described genetic modifications in Clostridium butyricum and
Rhodobacter sphaeroides to enhance hydrogen production, this subsection addresses the
metabolic and biochemical resource requirements imposed by these edits. Quantifying these
demands is essential to assess whether the engineered strains could sustain high-yield
hydrogen production without exceeding physiological tolerances or collapsing under
resource depletion.

Note on Enzyme Yield Non-Linearity:
While this model assumes that overexpression of hydrogenases and associated enzymes
leads to enhanced hydrogen yield, it is important to note that enzyme activity does not scale
linearly with gene expression levels. In practice, increasing transcription may not
proportionally increase catalytic turnover due to substrate limitation, cofactor saturation, and
feedback regulation. For example, hydrogenase activity may plateau at high expression
levels if reduced ferredoxin or NAD(P)H becomes limiting. Additionally, overexpression may
lead to improper protein folding or inclusion body formation, particularly under metabolic
stress. Therefore, the relationship between gene dosage and hydrogen yield is subject to
diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds, and this model's assumptions should be
interpreted as reflecting best-case catalytic availability rather than guaranteed performance
scaling.
Gene Stack Correction Factor (GSCF) Introduction
While this model assumes stable expression of a 6–8 gene enhancement set, real-world
systems often exhibit diminished returns beyond 4 simultaneous edits due to transcriptional
overload, ribosomal crowding, and cofactor scarcity. To bridge the gap between theoretical
performance and practical expression limits, we introduce a Gene Stack Correction Factor
(GSCF) as a heuristic yield modifier. This factor reflects the non-linear yield penalties
associated with stacked edits and can be applied multiplicatively to the uncorrected
hydrogen yield. Based on published microbial engineering studies, a GSCF of 0.6–0.9 is
proposed depending on stack complexity and metabolic burden. For example, if the system
theoretically produces 12 mol H₂ per cycle, a GSCF of 0.75 would reduce the adjusted yield
to 9 mol—a more biologically plausible outcome under high-expression load. This correction
aligns the model with empirical observations while preserving its utility as a theoretical
ceiling. All future system designs should benchmark gene stack size against yield plateau
thresholds to avoid metabolic collapse or regulatory interference.
4.4.1. ATP Demand from Nitrogenase Activity
The photofermentation stage, driven by R. sphaeroides, relies on nitrogenase to catalyse
hydrogen evolution from water and VFAs. Nitrogenase is ATP-intensive, requiring
approximately 16–24 ATP per mole of H₂ produced. This model adopts a midpoint estimate
of 20 ATP/mol H₂, resulting in a total demand of 200 ATP per mole of glucose processed
(given 10 mol H₂ from photofermentation).
While some of this ATP is regenerated via acetate metabolism (enhanced by ackA insertion)
and cyclic photophosphorylation, sustained operation requires a robust intracellular ATP
supply and efficient cofactor cycling.
4.4.1.1. ATP Demand vs. ATP Supply — Balancing Constraints
Nitrogenase-driven hydrogen evolution imposes a heavy ATP cost—estimated here at 20
ATP per mole of H₂, resulting in a demand of 200 mol ATP per cycle to produce 10 mol H₂
in the photofermentative stage. While the model assumes that ATP is regenerated via
acetate metabolism (enhanced through ackA insertion) and cyclic photophosphorylation,
this assumption represents a best-case energy budget that is rarely achievable without
active metabolic steering.

Acetate metabolism contributes an estimated 1–2 ATP per mol acetate, and
photophosphorylation offers 2–4 ATP per mol H₂ at optimal photon flux. However, real-world
systems often experience suboptimal light exposure, cofactor scarcity, or carbon flux
diversion—resulting in partial ATP regeneration. A conservative integration of these yields
suggests a probable output of only 100–150 mol ATP per cycle, leaving a shortfall of 25–
50%.
This ATP deficit would likely throttle nitrogenase activity, delaying or capping
photofermentative hydrogen yield. If ATP availability drops below critical thresholds, not only
does H₂ evolution slow, but redox balancing and cofactor recycling are also disrupted—
introducing systemic instability and potential feedback inhibition.
A corrected model scenario assuming only 150 mol ATP available would reduce
photofermentative H₂ production proportionally—from 10 mol down to ~7.5 mol, decreasing
the total cycle yield from 12 mol to ~9.5 mol.
Future iterations of this model should integrate dynamic ATP flux simulations, using
flux balance analysis (FBA) or constraint-based modelling to quantify enzyme activity
throttling under resource-limited conditions. Until then, this section presents an upper-bound
yield scenario, with clearly defined ATP bottlenecks as a realism modifier.
Clarification on Cyclic Photophosphorylation ATP Output:
The estimated ATP output from cyclic photophosphorylation (2–4 mol ATP per mol H₂) is
based on indirect analogues from purple non-sulphur bacteria and phototrophic growth
models under nitrogen-limited conditions. Empirical studies, such as those by Gest and
Kamen (1993) and Madigan et al. (2010), suggest that cyclic electron flow through the
photosynthetic apparatus in Rhodobacter sphaeroides can regenerate ATP at rates sufficient
to support nitrogenase activity when paired with acetate metabolism. While exact
stoichiometries vary due to differences in proton motive force efficiency and ATP synthase
coupling ratios, ATP yields in this range have been inferred from nitrogen-fixation-associated
photophosphorylation experiments. Therefore, the model adopts this bracketed estimate as
a biologically plausible range under ideal light intensity and uninterrupted electron flow
conditions. Further refinement would require kinetic simulations of electron transport rates
and intracellular ATP flux.

Gap: Up to 50–100 mol ATP shortfall may occur if substrate-level phosphorylation or lightdriven ATP regeneration is suboptimal.
Implication: Without precise control of metabolic routing and light efficiency, nitrogenase
activity may be throttled due to intracellular ATP scarcity. This would reduce hydrogen yield
and/or trigger stress responses that disrupt expression stability.
A full ATP budget under dynamic conditions should be incorporated into future models using
flux balance analysis (FBA) or kinetic simulations. For now, the system’s ATP sufficiency is
treated as a limiting factor, and actual hydrogen yields may fall below the theoretical ceiling
unless additional ATP-regenerating strategies are employed (e.g., enhanced cyclic electron
flow, acetate supplementation, or heterologous ATP synthase integration).
Realistic ATP-Limited Yield Adjustment
Based on current pathway estimates, the photofermentation stage demands ~200 mol ATP
per cycle to drive nitrogenase-catalysed hydrogen evolution. However, the model's ATP
supply—via acetate metabolism and cyclic photophosphorylation—realistically maxes out
between 100–150 mol ATP per cycle under optimal conditions. This leaves a projected ATP
deficit of 25–50%, which proportionally throttles nitrogenase activity. Assuming a linear ATPto-H₂ coupling (20 ATP/mol H₂), this implies a revised photofermentative hydrogen yield of
7.5–9 mol H₂, depending on metabolic routing and light conditions.
Accordingly, the system’s total hydrogen yield per cycle drops from 12 mol to ~9.5–11
mol, once ATP availability is considered. Future models should integrate ATP-coupled flux
penalties directly into kinetic simulations to capture this constraint more dynamically. Until
then, the current model's full-yield scenario should be interpreted as a theoretical ceiling
contingent on ideal energy regeneration, uninterrupted light flux, and acetate availability. Any
deviation from these assumptions risks substantial yield collapse due to ATP bottlenecks.
4.4.2. Fe-S Cluster and Metal Cofactor Requirements
Both [FeFe]-hydrogenase (overexpressed via hydA↑) and nitrogenase require iron-sulphur
(Fe-S) clusters, with nitrogenase additionally requiring molybdenum. The biosynthesis of
these cofactors is ATP-dependent and sensitive to intracellular metal availability.
Enzyme
[Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase
Nitrogenase (NifDK)

Fe Requirement
2-3 Fe atoms per unit
~8 Fe, 7 S, 1 Mo

Key Cofactor
Fe-S clusters
Fe-S MoFe cofactor

Without sufficient Fe²⁺ and MoO₄²⁻ supplementation, expression levels will bottleneck. Realworld microbial cultures often experience yield collapse when metal availability becomes
rate-limiting, particularly in continuous systems.
4.4.2.1. Cofactor Limitations as a Performance Bottleneck
The model assumes sufficient supplementation of trace metals such as Fe²⁺ and MoO₄²⁻ to
support the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters and the FeMo cofactor required for [FeFe]hydrogenase and nitrogenase, respectively. However, this oversimplifies the bioavailability
kinetics and competitive uptake dynamics that occur in microbial cultures.

In continuous bioreactors or batch systems with high expression burdens, trace metals often
become rate-limiting not due to absolute absence—but due to poor solubility, ion
competition, or metabolic uptake saturation. For instance, Fe²⁺ must compete with Mn²⁺,
Zn²⁺, and Cu²⁺ at membrane transporters, while molybdate (MoO₄²⁻) can be competitively
inhibited by sulphate or phosphate anions.
Additionally, Fe-S cluster assembly is an ATP-dependent, protein-mediated process
requiring coordination with HydE/F/G maturation pathways. Any disruption—whether from
cofactor scarcity, oxidative stress, or pH drift—can stall hydrogenase/nitrogenase assembly
and sharply reduce yield.
This model does not yet simulate:
•

Transporter affinity thresholds for metal uptake

•

Chelation kinetics in complex media

•

Metal precipitation risks under suboptimal pH or redox conditions

Future models should integrate trace metal mass balances, transporter saturation kinetics,
and bioavailability correction factors—especially for Fe and Mo—to predict system yield
more accurately under industrial or continuous-use scenarios. For now, metal availability is
flagged as a potential hidden bottleneck, capable of undermining even fully expressed
enzyme systems.
Both enzymes rely on complex and resource-intensive metalloprotein assembly
pathways:
Enzyme
[FeFe]-Hydrogenase

Cofactor Requirement
2–3 Fe atoms per unit; Fe-S
clusters

Nitrogenase (NifDK)

~8 Fe, 7 S, 1 Mo per unit

Biosynthetic Complexity
Dependent on functional HydEFG
maturation proteins and iron
homeostasis
Requires full Fe-S cluster
biogenesis and molybdenum
incorporation via NifEN pathway

Cofactor Availability and Economic Feasibility Note: Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential
cofactor for nitrogenase activity, typically incorporated into the FeMo-cofactor cluster at a
rate of ~1 mol Mo per mol of active nitrogenase. For the modelled system—assuming full
activation of nitrogenase to produce 10 mol H₂ per cycle—this corresponds to a theoretical
requirement of approximately 1 mmol Mo per mole of glucose processed. At current bulk
pricing for molybdate salts (e.g., ammonium molybdate), this equates to a cost of less than
$0.50 per batch (based on $40 per 100 g, molar mass ≈ 123.9 g/mol). Given its industrial
availability, low cost, and widespread use in agriculture, molybdenum does not present a
logistical or economic bottleneck for system deployment. However, its bioavailability must be
managed carefully to avoid toxicity, and real-world systems may benefit from trace metal
recycling strategies to maintain sustainable operation.

4.4.3. NAD(P)H Demand and Redox Balancing
Overexpression of bchP and crtB in R. sphaeroides boosts photosystem formation and
light-harvesting efficiency but increases NADPH consumption. Biosynthesis of
bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids requires multiple NADPH molecules per pigment
unit, particularly during biofilm establishment phases. This can cause early-stage redox
imbalance and may necessitate transhydrogenase activity or metabolic reallocation.
Estimated NADPH diversion during initial pigment biosynthesis may approach 20–30% of
the available pool, competing with core metabolic functions if unregulated.
4.4.4. Expression Load and Transcriptional Capacity
Stacking 6–8 genes under high-strength promoters increases the demand for RNA
polymerase, ribosomes, and processing enzymes. Even with chromosomal integration,
excessive constitutive expression can saturate transcriptional machinery, triggering
unintended feedback loops or silencing effects. Promoter crowding, mRNA degradation
limits, and translational burden must be considered.

To support these expression demands, the model assumes:

Supplemented growth media with Fe²⁺ (≥20 µM), trace Mo, and buffered
NAD⁺/NADP⁺ regeneration capacity

•

Stage-specific promoter design (e.g., light-inducible for bchP, stress-inducible for
hydA) to stagger gene expression

•

Potential inclusion of ATP-regenerating pathways or cyclic photophosphorylation
enhancers

Failure to meet these conditions in practical systems could result in:
•

Loss of expression fidelity over time

•

Early plateauing of hydrogen yields due to cofactor exhaustion.

•

Activation of stress response pathways or unintended mutations in high-burden
operons

Author’s Note: While these burdens are quantified to the extent possible within a theoretical
framework, their exact thresholds are highly context-dependent and would require dynamic
flux balance analysis (dFBA) and proteomic data to model precisely. The intent here is to
flag these risks for consideration in future experimental or in silico simulations.
Personal Limitation Acknowledgement
I want to be fully transparent about this part of the model. While I have done my best to
design and rationalize the proposed genetic modifications based on existing literature, I do
not currently have the expertise—or the computational tools—to model the deeper layers of
metabolic burden, cofactor imbalance, or regulatory drift that these changes would
realistically trigger.
These things are real and complex, and I do not want to pretend otherwise. Modelling gene
expression stability, metabolic flux distributions, or system-wide energy budgets would
require advanced simulations like flux balance analysis (FBA), and that is well beyond my
current skill set.
So, for now, I am treating these genetic edits as a best-case hypothetical scenario—not
because biology is this clean, but because I wanted to explore the ceiling of what such a
system might achieve if everything worked optimally.
Future Requirement: Dynamic Flux and Cofactor Modelling
While this framework establishes a clear theoretical ceiling, it does not include dynamic
modelling of intracellular resource allocation, cofactor competition, or redox balancing.
Biological systems are governed by non-linear flux networks where enzyme activity,
ATP/NAD(P)H levels, and trace metal availability form tightly regulated, feedback-coupled
systems. The overexpression of hydrogenase, nitrogenase, and light-harvesting proteins
places enormous demand on Fe-S clusters, ATP pools, and NAD(P)H regeneration, all of
which interact in ways that static stoichiometric models cannot resolve.
To capture these constraints, future iterations of this model should incorporate flux balance
analysis (FBA) or constraint-based modelling (CBM) using genome-scale metabolic
reconstructions of C. butyricum and R. sphaeroides. Such tools would allow time-resolved
prediction of cofactor depletion, ATP bottlenecks, and gene stack performance under varying
substrate, light, and nutrient conditions. Until then, this paper offers an upper-bound
performance envelope under the assumption of stable expression, non-limiting cofactors,
and uninterrupted energy flux. These assumptions are flagged for future experimental
validation or computational refinement.
While cofactor and redox dynamics are acknowledged as critical, they are beyond the
current model’s static scope and are proposed for future constraint-based refinement.

5. Two-Stage Bioreactor Design and Structural Considerations
The proposed system is a two-stage, vertically integrated microbial hydrogen production
reactor designed to optimize substrate conversion and gas recovery efficiency. It combines
dark fermentation and photofermentation processes in a unified chassis, with integrated
membrane-based gas separation positioned above the biological chambers. The system is
conceptually treated as a synthetic microbial consortium, where cross-species metabolic
routing and spatial compartmentalization are leveraged to maximize efficiency. The reactor
model is developed at bench-scale for a single-cycle processing of 1 mol glucose (~180 g),
representing a conceptual prototype volume of approximately 1–2 litres.

5.1. Structural Layout
The upper chamber houses a scaffold-supported biofilm of Clostridium butyricum,
maintained under strict anaerobic and dark conditions. This chamber receives glucose-rich
substrate and facilitates dark fermentation, generating hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and volatile
fatty acids (VFAs)—primarily butyrate and acetate. VFAs then flow downward via gravity
through a perforated partition into the lower chamber, minimizing the need for pumping. To
prevent VFA stagnation and nutrient layering, the system incorporates intermittent lowpower peristaltic mixing, allowing fluid recirculation without disturbing biofilm structure.
This gentle agitation also redistributes thermal gradients and ensures substrate availability
across chamber depth.

The lower chamber contains a photofermentative biofilm of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, grown
on light-permeable support structures. This zone is illuminated continuously with lowintensity light (~30 µmol/m²/s), activating nitrogenase-dependent photofermentation of VFAs
into additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide. To prevent uneven light distribution across
biofilm surfaces, the lower chamber incorporates multi-angle internal LED arrays and
limits biofilm panel thickness to <1 mm. This configuration reduces shadow zones, maintains
consistent nitrogenase activation, and mitigates attenuation effects common in optically
dense biofilms. LED units are housed in sealed, transparent enclosures integrated within the
chamber walls to preserve anaerobic integrity. Thermal insulation prevents local convection
currents and protects microbial gradients, while transparent polycarbonate barriers allow
uninterrupted light transmission. Both chambers are equipped with separate nutrient ports
and pH stabilization controls.
5.1.1 Thermal Stability and Heat Load Control
Although the reactor is designed for short-cycle operation (≤72 hours), metabolic heat
generation and continuous photofermentation lighting introduce non-negligible thermal
stress. Both microbial systems—Clostridium butyricum and Rhodobacter sphaeroides—
exhibit peak hydrogen productivity at temperatures between 28–32°C, with yield drop-offs
and enzymatic instability observed above ~35°C.
This model assumes passive heat dissipation through structural conduction and ambient
thermal diffusion. However, realistic implementation may require active thermal stabilization
to maintain optimal internal temperatures. Potential thermal management solutions include:
•

•

Passive Measures:
o

High-conductivity aluminium or copper heat-sinks

o

Surface-mounted thermal paste layers or graphene cooling films

o

Natural convection via side-ventilation grills

Active Measures:
o

Thermoelectric (Peltier) cooling plates affixed to outer reactor walls.

o

External water-jacket circulation systems for continuous heat removal

o

Embedded thermistor array with automated fan/pump triggers

A simplified heat generation estimate based on LED power input and microbial activity
suggests potential internal gains of 1.5–3.5°C per 24 hours if unmanaged. While this system
remains theoretically stable over one batch cycle, future scale-ups or continuous operation
will necessitate formal thermal modelling and fail-safes to prevent enzyme denaturation and
biofilm instability.

5.1.2 Thermal Load Estimate (Bench-Scale)
To quantify potential internal temperature rise, a simplified thermal load estimate was
performed using input power values from key reactor components and known heat capacity
values of water.
Assumptions:
•

LED system = 5 Watts continuous (assume 100% of power converted to heat)

•

Control systems and minor mixing = 2 Watts average thermal load

•

Total thermal input power ≈ 7 W

•

System runtime: 24 hours = 86,400 seconds

•

Reactor fluid volume = 2 L = 2000 g (assuming density ≈ water)

•

Specific heat capacity of water (c) = 4.18 J/g°C

Step 1: Total Heat Energy Generated
𝑄 = 𝑃 × 𝑡 = 7𝑊 × 86,400𝑠 = 604,800 𝐽
Step 2: Estimate Temperature Rise
∆𝑇 =

𝑄
604,800 𝐽
=
≈ 72.3 °𝐶
𝑚×𝑐
2000𝑔 × 4.18 𝐽/𝑔°𝐶

This represents maximum uncontrolled heating if no heat escapes. In practice, natural
convection, conduction through reactor walls, and evaporative cooling remove >95% of that
heat at bench scale.
Conservative estimate of retained thermal energy: 2–5%
∆𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 ≈ 1.4 − 3.6 ℃/𝑑𝑎𝑦
This supports the prior claim of ~1.5–3.5°C rise per 24 hours, aligning with published
values in similar low-power biofilm systems.

5.2. Prototype Reactor Design and Spatial Requirements
Overview
To validate the theoretical model at a manageable scale, a miniaturized version of the
dual-stage microbial hydrogen reactor is proposed. This "starter pack" prototype will
replicate the kinetics, biomass limitations, and flux balancing dynamics of the full 5500 L
system at a 1:1000 scale, totaling 5.5 L of operational volume. All spatial ratios between the
dark fermentation (Clostridium butyricum) and photofermentation (Rhodobacter sphaeroides)
stages are preserved to ensure that data derived from the prototype can be reliably scaled
upward.

Biomass Constraints and Spatial Allocation
The two microbial species exhibit different biomass constraints, primarily due to their
metabolic mode and environmental limitations:
•

Clostridium butyricum is an anaerobic dark fermenter and tolerates high-density
conditions up to 15 g/L dry weight biomass. Its reactor environment is compact,
gas-sealed, and optimized for glucose conversion into hydrogen, VFAs, and CO₂.

•

Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a photoheterotrophic organism requiring light
exposure for VFA consumption and hydrogen production. Due to light attenuation and
internal biofilm shadowing, its effective biomass ceiling is ~6 g/L dry weight, beyond
which photosynthetic efficiency drops sharply.

To balance the VFA flux between these organisms, it is necessary to scale the Rhodobacter
volume to 3.125× the Clostridium volume. This ensures complete uptake of VFAs under
optimal kinetics, preventing toxic buildup and ensuring continuous hydrogen production in
the second stage.

Application
This prototype reactor can serve as a lab-scale validation system to:
•

Monitor glucose feed and VFA flux in real time

•

Validate stoichiometric yield expectations

•

Assess light-based VFA consumption efficiency

•

Tune pH control loops and buffer capacity

•

Prototype automation with programmable microcontrollers (e.g., Raspberry Pi,
Arduino)

Once validated, results from the prototype will enable scale-up toward industrial applications
without violating microbial density thresholds or introducing VFA imbalance bottlenecks.

5.3. Biofilm Limitations and Realism Considerations
While this model assumes biofilm layers remain structurally stable and spatially uniform
across both fermentation stages, real-world systems experience significant challenges in
maintaining long-term biofilm integrity. Issues such as detachment, overgrowth, nutrient
gradient formation, and light attenuation (particularly in the photofermentation stage) are
well-documented. Biofilm clogging may disrupt fluid and VFA flow between chambers, while
irregular microbial growth could reduce gas exchange efficiency. Additionally, biofilms often
require scheduled cleaning or regenerative protocols to maintain performance in continuous
systems.
These limitations are not included in this theoretical model to preserve stoichiometric clarity
and kinetic tractability. However, future system design must address biofilm management
through structural scaffolding, flow control strategies, or cyclic biofilm replacement. This
remains one of the most critical engineering challenges in translating microbial hydrogen
systems from bench-scale to continuous industrial operation.
The reactor’s design supports modular biofilm panel exchange, allowing saturated or
detached panels to be manually or mechanically rotated out on a regular schedule. This
approach minimizes downtime and supports continuous operation, especially in pilot-scale or
industrial implementations.

5.3.1. Biofilm Degradation Timing and Panel Replacement Rates:
Although this model assumes spatially uniform and stable biofilm performance throughout
each fermentation cycle, practical systems must contend with gradual biofilm degradation,
metabolic fatigue, and physical detachment. Biofilm productivity typically follows a bell-curve
pattern over time—rising during initial colonization, peaking at full metabolic activity, and
declining as nutrient gradients, waste accumulation, or quorum signalling trigger senescence
or lysis. In Clostridium and Rhodobacter systems, peak productivity is often sustained for
48–72 hours before measurable drops in hydrogen output occur.
Based on literature from continuous-flow and batch bioreactors, biofilm panels may require
replacement or regeneration every 2–4 operational cycles (approx. 6–10 days) to maintain
consistent gas yields. Productivity loss is typically inferred from declining gas evolution rates
or increasing metabolite residue buildup. In future implementations, real-time monitoring
systems such as inline gas flowmeters or capacitive biofilm thickness probes could be used
to trigger automated panel rotation schedules. These interventions would minimize downtime
and reduce the risk of clogging or metabolic collapse in long-term setups. For this theoretical
model, the system is assumed to operate within the optimal productivity window, with biofilm
exchange occurring post-cycle.
5.3.2. Biofilm Surface Area Exposure and Photonic Limitation
While the reactor model emphasizes volumetric throughput (e.g., mol H₂ per litre per day),
the true limiting factor in photofermentation is not volume but surface area exposed to
light. Unlike dark fermentation, photofermentative hydrogen production by Rhodobacter
sphaeroides depends on the availability of photons to activate nitrogenase and lightharvesting complexes.
Even under continuous illumination, light attenuation in microbial biofilms becomes a
serious constraint beyond ~1 mm thickness due to absorption, scattering, and
shadowing effects.
Estimated Photon Requirements:
Based on empirical data:
•

Nitrogenase activation requires 30–50 µmol photons/m²/s for optimal function.

•

Commercial LED panels produce ~100–200 µmol/m²/s at a proximity.

If photofermentation is to yield 10 mol H₂ per glucose as proposed, then:
Approximate light demand = 300–500 µmol photons per second per mole of substrate
That translates to:
•

Photon exposure area = 0.04–0.08 m² per cycle at minimum, assuming tight
efficiency

•

For your 2-litre system, this means a minimum of 0.02–0.04 m² per litre of reactor
volume.

Surface Area:Volume Ratio (SA:V) Targeting
To avoid photonic bottlenecking, the following design constraint should be integrated into
reactor planning:
Target Surface Area ≥ 0.02 m² per litre of reactor volume, preferably ≥ 0.03 m² for safety
margin.
For a 2-litre reactor, that’s:
•

40–60 cm² of light-exposed biofilm area, ideally distributed evenly across the inner
surface via panel or spiral scaffolds

This value can be met via:
•

Vertical light-permeable baffles

•

Spiral microfilm scaffolds

•

Rotating thin-panel arrays submerged in the photoreactor zone.

Photon Flux and Surface Area Clarification
Photofermentation rates depend on surface-exposed biofilm area rather than total volume.
The model uses a minimum light exposure requirement of 0.02–0.03 m² per litre of reactor
volume to avoid nitrogenase inhibition.
Added standard metric:
Areal light exposure: 0.04 m² per 2 L reactor (meets required 0.02 m²/L threshold)
Ensure areal productivity is always reported alongside volumetric values to avoid misleading
interpretations.
Mitigation of Shadow Zones
To ensure consistent light activation:
•

Multi-angle LED arrays should be positioned to eliminate angular blind spots.

•

Panel spacing must allow reflected light and convection to pass through.

•

Light diffusers or frosted panels may help even out photon flux.

Implication on Reported Yield Metrics
If the surface area per litre drops below threshold:
•

Nitrogenase activation becomes suboptimal.

•

Effective H₂ yield drops, even if VFA supply and reactor volume are sufficient.

•

Reported 10 mol H₂ per mol glucose becomes non-physical due to light starvation.

To reflect this:
Yield reporting should always be normalized per m² of light-exposed surface for
photofermentation stages. For example:
Metric
H₂ Productivity (volumetric)
H₂ Productivity (areal)

Value
44.85 L H₂/L/day
~1120 L H₂/m²/day (at 0.04 m² per 2 L)

Photonic Constraint and Surface Area-Linked Yield Limitations
While volumetric hydrogen productivity (e.g., L H₂ per L reactor per day) remains a common
benchmarking metric, it can be misleading in photofermentation systems, where light
availability—not reactor volume—is the true limiting factor. Nitrogenase activity in
Rhodobacter sphaeroides is directly dependent on continuous photon flux. In systems where
surface area is insufficient, biofilm zones become light-starved, reducing effective hydrogen
yield despite substrate availability.
To ensure photon flux supports the theoretical 10 mol H₂ per mole of glucose, a minimum
light-exposed surface area of 0.02–0.03 m² per litre is required. If surface area falls below
this threshold, nitrogenase activation becomes suboptimal and the actual H₂ yield may drop
well below volumetric predictions. This model assumes light saturation is achieved across all
productive surfaces, but future reporting should always include:
•

Volumetric yield (L H₂/L/day)

•

Areal yield (L H₂/m²/day)

•

SA:V ratio (m² per L)

These constraints prevent overestimation of system output and align the theoretical ceiling
with physically enforceable design parameters. A surface area shortfall should be considered
a hard cap on hydrogen productivity, regardless of substrate excess or reactor scale.

Author's Note:
While volumetric normalization is traditional in fermentation literature, it can conceal
photofermentation failure modes. By including a surface-area constraint, this model avoids a
common pitfall in hydrogen system design—if light just “gets in there” without mapping
where, how, or if it lands.

5.4. Gas Capture and Flow Control
Gas production discussed here follows biochemical conversion within the structured reactor
system detailed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
Gas produced in both chambers accumulates in a shared headspace connected to a
vacuum-assisted membrane separation system. The membrane system is assumed to be
positioned externally above the bioreactor chambers and isolated from direct microbial
contact to avoid fouling or biofilm disruption. Gas is extracted from the headspace without
disturbing pressure conditions inside the bioreactor. Hydrogen is separated and collected as
product, while carbon dioxide is directed toward external fixation systems as detailed in the
CO₂ redirection strategy.
5.4.1. Hydrogen Accumulation and Feedback Inhibition:
While this model acknowledges that Clostridium butyricum and Rhodobacter sphaeroides
exhibit feedback inhibition at H₂ partial pressures exceeding 0.6–0.8 atm, it does not
currently simulate the rate of gas accumulation or the membrane system's throughput
capacity. This omission creates a dangerous assumption: that gas removal is effectively
instantaneous and continuous.
The kinetic mismatch between hydrogen generation and membrane diffusion is a
critical design vulnerability. Based on a production rate of 0.167 mol H₂/hr and a 0.5 L gas
headspace, the partial pressure threshold for inhibition is reached in under 5 minutes
without active extraction. This translates to a required membrane throughput of at least 2.7
mmol/min just to maintain sub-inhibitory headspace conditions.
Yet the model does not specify:
•

Membrane surface area (m²)

•

Permeability rate (Nm³/m²/h/bar)

•

Vacuum cycle timing or capacity.

Without these values, it is impossible to guarantee that the system avoids enzyme
suppression. Real membranes exhibit finite flux governed by Fick's Law, and polymer-MOF
hybrids typically achieve 0.1–0.5 Nm³/m²/h/bar at best. To match the required flow, even a
bench-scale system may need 10–20 cm² of active membrane area under steady
vacuum—a nontrivial engineering constraint.
Dynamic Headspace Model and Membrane Throughput Limitations
To simulate enzyme viability more accurately during gas accumulation, a time-dependent
headspace pressure model should be integrated into future iterations. Under standard
fermentation rates (~0.167 mol H₂/hr), hydrogen accumulation in a 0.5 L headspace reaches
inhibitory partial pressures (>0.6 atm) in under five minutes. This imposes a minimum
membrane throughput requirement of ~2.7 mmol/min to maintain sub-inhibitory levels. Real
membrane flux rates, governed by Fick’s law, typically range between 0.1–0.5 Nm³/m²/h/bar
for MOF-polymer hybrids, implying a required membrane area of 10–20 cm² under vacuumassisted flow. The current model assumes continuous, lossless gas extraction—an
unrealistic constraint at bench or pilot scale.

Therefore, we propose a Membrane Flux Correction Factor (MFCF) to account for
suboptimal gas clearance. For conservative benchmarking, yields in future models should be
scaled by 0.7–0.85 depending on membrane permeability, fouling, and system response
time. Real-time pressure regulation and multi-stage gas extraction loops may be required to
prevent inhibitory backpressure during high-output periods. Until such a kinetic gas module
is developed, all uncorrected H₂ productivity estimates in this paper should be treated as
theoretical ceilings contingent on perfect ventilation and membrane performance.
Furthermore, extraction delay or vacuum cycling lag could create pressure pulses, briefly
pushing partial pressure above the enzymatic inhibition point, thereby throttling yield or
triggering stress responses.
Model Extension Recommendation: Headspace Accumulation Kinetics
Future iterations of this model should incorporate a dynamic gas accumulation module,
simulating pressure rise curves and matching them against membrane flow capacities. Until
then, current H₂ yield estimates may be significantly inflated due to unmodeled feedback
inhibition risks during periods of poor headspace ventilation.

5.4.2. Control Systems and Feedback Architecture
Real-time control of environmental parameters is essential for maintaining the functional
stability of the dual-stage microbial hydrogen production system. While earlier sections
describe a theoretically ideal bioreactor with constant substrate diffusion, light penetration,
and anaerobic integrity, real systems require feedback loops to compensate for internal
fluctuations, metabolic drift, and external stressors.
This section outlines a modular control strategy designed to monitor and correct deviations
in temperature, pH, light intensity, gas accumulation, and CO₂ sequestration rates. All
controls are assumed to operate on low-power microcontroller-based platforms (e.g.,
Arduino, Raspberry Pi) using standard biosensor interfaces.
5.4.3. Quantified Hydrogen Accumulation and Inhibition Thresholds:
The inhibitory effects of hydrogen accumulation on enzymatic activity are well-documented
in microbial hydrogen systems. Hydrogenase in Clostridium butyricum and nitrogenase in
Rhodobacter sphaeroides exhibit feedback suppression at elevated hydrogen partial
pressures, typically around 0.6–0.8 atm. Under the current reactor model, which assumes
approximately 12 mol of hydrogen produced over a 72-hour cycle (~0.167 mol/hr), this
threshold is reached rapidly if no gas removal occurs.
For a 2-litre reactor with a 0.5-litre gas headspace—a standard design assumption—
hydrogen accumulation reaches 0.6 atm partial pressure in less than 5 minutes of
continuous production. This corresponds to the accumulation of just ~13.4 mmol of H₂,
based on ideal gas calculations at STP (22.4 L/mol). Without active gas extraction or
continuous vacuum cycling, the system would quickly enter a regime of enzymatic inhibition,
reducing hydrogen yield and potentially inducing redox or energy stress in the microbial
population.
This analysis highlights the critical importance of real-time gas removal or pressurecontrolled headspace venting in batch and continuous systems. Future iterations of this
model should incorporate hydrogen accumulation kinetics and headspace pressure
dynamics to simulate enzyme behaviour more accurately under varying operational
conditions.
Supporting Calculation: Time to Reach Inhibitory H₂ Pressure
Given:
•

Hydrogen production rate: 12 mol / 72 hr = 0.167 mol/hr

•

Reactor headspace volume: 0.5 L

•

Inhibitory partial pressure threshold: 0.6 atm

•

Molar volume at STP: 22.4 L/mol

Required moles of H₂ to reach 0.6 atm in 0.5 L headspace:

Thus, if hydrogen is not extracted or diffused out of the headspace, the system will exceed
the inhibitory threshold in under 5 minutes of operation.
Side Note: This model assumes headspace management sufficient to prevent hydrogen
accumulation above inhibitory thresholds. Future work will address dynamic gas control
strategies to maintain enzymatic activity over extended operation.

5.4.3.2. Control Logic Flow and Safety Behaviour
Each parameter operates within a hierarchical control loop, where low-severity deviations
trigger passive adjustments (e.g., LED dimming), while high-severity deviations initiate active
fail-safes (e.g., CO₂ rerouting or system shutdown).
Example Control Chain:
1. Normal: Temp = 30°C → stable
2. Warning: Temp = 33°C → Fan or TEC turns on
3. Critical: Temp = 36°C → LED cutoff + halt fermentation → log error

Fail-safe behaviour includes:
•

Auto-throttling of gas flow if CO₂ sensors detect oversaturation in the sequestration
pod.

•

Redundant pH control with dual dosing pumps to prevent sensor drift-induced pH
crash.

Real-time log file generation for offline diagnostics

PID (proportional–integral–derivative) control for smooth system corrections

Simple logic-based control (if/then) for robustness in off-grid deployments

•

GSM or Wi-Fi module for remote alerting and telemetry (for field setups)

5.4.3.4. Deployment Note
While these control systems are low-cost and modular at bench scale, scaling up would
require industrial-grade PLCs (programmable logic controllers), multi-channel sensor arrays,
and real-time process monitoring dashboards. For field or developing-world setups,
simplicity and resilience are prioritized over digital optimization.

5.5. Assumptions and Limitations
•

Uniform substrate diffusion and metabolic activity are assumed across both
biofilms. Nutrient gradients, quorum dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity are
excluded from this model.

•

No cross-contamination or metabolic inhibition is assumed between microbial
zones.

•

Light distribution in the photofermentation chamber is considered sufficient and
non-limiting.

•

Vacuum extraction system is modelled as non-intrusive and energetically lossless,
though this remains a significant engineering challenge.

Author's Note:
A theoretical system cannot be called "complete" if it assumes perfect environmental stability
and ignores control infrastructure. These feedback systems not only maintain biological
integrity but also function as ethical enforcers for the CO₂ redirection requirement, ensuring
that industrial misuse cannot bypass sustainability protocols without triggering visible alarms
or system throttling.

6. Biofilm Reactor Architecture and Biomass Scaling
While the primary system modelling in this paper is based on volumetric assumptions (g/L),
a growing body of literature supports the use of biofilm-based reactors as a superior
platform for microbial hydrogen production—particularly under continuous or semicontinuous operation. This section introduces a dedicated biofilm reactor model optimized
for Clostridium butyricum in the dark fermentation stage, replacing traditional suspension
assumptions with surface-area-based biomass density and biofilm-specific engineering
parameters.
6.1 Rationale for Biofilm Implementation
Biofilm reactors offer several operational and kinetic advantages over suspended systems:
•

Higher effective biomass density without risk of washout

•

Improved retention time and microbial longevity

•

Reduced diffusion distance for substrates and products

•

Lower shear stress and energy input compared to stirred tanks

These benefits are especially relevant in hydrogen-producing anaerobes like C. butyricum,
where metabolic performance is sensitive to environmental stability.
6.2 Biofilm Biomass Density (g/m²)
In contrast to the suspended biomass density of 15 g/L, biofilm systems are quantified by
dry biomass per unit surface area. Literature sources report:
•

Typical range: 15–25 g/m² [Morimoto et al., 2004]

•

Optimized systems: 30–40 g/m²

For equivalent hydrogen output to a 15 g/L suspension system (per litre), a biofilm reactor
would require:
That is, 0.5 m² of biofilm surface area per litre of equivalent reactor volume at 30 g/m²
loading.
6.3 Carrier Scaffold Materials and Surface Design
Effective biofilm formation requires scaffold materials that promote microbial adhesion and
biofilm stability. Common supports include:
•

Polyurethane foam: High porosity, low cost

•

Carbon felt: Chemically stable, high surface roughness

•

Glass beads or mesh: Inert, reusable

•

Stainless steel mesh: Rigid and durable, allows heating or conductivity integration

Scaffold geometry (spiral coils, vertical panels, fixed-bed columns) is a critical design
parameter, and influences flow distribution and surface accessibility.

6.4 Biofilm Limitations and Turnover
Biofilms are not immortal. Long-term operation may encounter:
•

Biofilm degradation and cell detachment

•

Clogging or uneven flow patterns

•

Substrate channelling and dead zones

Productivity usually follows a bell-shaped curve with a lifespan of 2–4 batch cycles (6–10
days) before requiring panel replacement or regeneration.
6.5 Integration with Current Reactor Model
This biofilm adaptation retains the dual-stage design but modifies the dark fermentation
chamber to:
•

Replace g/L metrics with g/m² targets

•

Design chamber internals for ≥0.5 m²/L surface exposure

•

Use low-shear recirculation instead of stirring

Future iterations of this model may fully transition all biomass metrics to surface-area units.
For now, this section offers a standalone comparison and integration guideline.
6.6 Estimated Biofilm-Based Production Rates for Clostridium butyricum
Assuming an optimized biofilm with a dry biomass density of 40 g/m², the following
process rates are calculated using standard specific activity values for C. butyricum:
•

Specific glucose uptake rate (qs): 10 mmol/g/hr

•

Hydrogen yield: 2 mol H₂/mol glucose

•

VFA yield: ~1 mol VFA/mol glucose (primarily butyrate and acetate)

Per m² of biofilm surface:
•

Glucose consumption: 10 mmol/g/hr × 40 g = 400 mmol/hr = 72.06 g/hr

•

Hydrogen production: 0.4 mol glucose/hr × 2 mol H₂/mol = 0.8 mol H₂/hr ≈ 17.93 L
H₂/hr

•

VFA production: ~0.4 mol/hr (approx. 0.28 mol butyrate, 0.12 mol acetate)

Per m² per day:
•

Glucose consumption: ≈ 1.73 kg/day

•

Hydrogen production: ≈ 19.2 mol/day ≈ 430 L H₂/m²/day

•

Total VFA output: ≈ 9.6 mol/day

These rates represent optimized, literature-supported output values under anaerobic, 37°C,
pH-stabilized conditions, with sufficient glucose availability and no hydrogen inhibition.

6.7 Photofermentative Biofilm Analysis and Butyrate Flux Matching
To fully utilize the butyrate produced by Clostridium butyricum, the downstream
photofermentative stage must be scaled appropriately to match its VFA output. Based on
optimized conditions:
•

Rhodobacter sphaeroides demonstrates butyrate uptake of ~6 mmol/g/hr under
continuous illumination (≥30 µmol/m²/s)

•

At a biomass density of 18 g/m², this corresponds to:
6 𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑔/ℎ𝑟 × 18𝑔 = 108 𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑙/ℎ𝑟 = 0.108 𝑚𝑜𝑙/ℎ𝑟/𝑚2

•

Hydrogen yield from butyrate: 10 mol H₂/mol butyrate, yielding:
0.108 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒/ℎ𝑟 × 10 = 1.08 𝑚𝑜𝑙𝐻2 /ℎ𝑟 = 24.2 𝐿 𝐻2 /ℎ𝑟/𝑚2

Comparative Butyrate Balance (1 m² basis):
•

Clostridium produces ~0.4 mol/hr of butyrate

•

Rhodobacter consumes ~0.108 mol/hr of butyrate

To match these rates, the surface area of Rhodobacter must be scaled accordingly:
0.4
≈ 3.7𝑚2 𝑅ℎ𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑚2 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑚
0.108
This establishes a recommended biofilm surface ratio of:
1 : 3.7 (Clostridium : Rhodobacter)
Implementing this ratio prevents VFA accumulation, maintains substrate balance, and
ensures uninterrupted hydrogen production across both stages.
6.8 CO₂ Output and Biological Fixation Using Sugarcane
To maintain a closed-loop carbon cycle, the CO₂ generated by microbial hydrogen
production must be recycled via biological sinks. Both stages—dark fermentation and
photofermentation—release CO₂:
•

Clostridium butyricum (dark fermentation): C6H12O6 → C4H8O2 + 2CO2 + 2H2
Producing 2 mol CO₂/mol glucose → 0.4 mol glucose/hr × 2 = 0.8 mol CO₂/hr =
19.2 mol CO₂/day

•

Rhodobacter sphaeroides (photofermentation): C4H8O2 + 6H2O → 10H2 + 4CO2
Consuming 0.4 mol butyrate/day → 1.6 mol CO₂/hr = 38.4 mol CO₂/day

Total CO₂ Output: 19.2 + 38.4 = 57.6 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐶𝑂2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦
Using controlled greenhouse sugarcane with a Leaf Area Index (LAI) of 25, CO₂ fixation is:
32.5 𝜇𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑚2 /𝑠 × 36,000 𝑠/𝑑𝑎𝑦 = 1.17 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐶𝑂2 /𝑚2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦
1.17 𝑚𝑜𝑙 × 25 = 29.25 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐶𝑂2 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑/𝑚2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦

To fully capture 57.6 mol CO₂/day, the required sugarcane ground area is:
57.6
≈ 1.97 𝑚2
29.25
Thus, 1.97 m² of sugarcane, under optimal photosynthetic conditions, is sufficient to offset
the CO₂ emissions of the entire system, achieving net-zero or negative-carbon operation.
6.9 Comparative Yield Assessment: Suspension vs. Biofilm Reactor
To quantify the improvement introduced by transitioning from a suspension-based design to
a biofilm system, the following comparative assessment is made:
Suspension Reactor (5.5 L total volume):
•

Clostridium chamber: 1 L @ 15 g/L

•

Rhodobacter chamber: 3.125 L @ 6 g/L (scaled to match VFA flux)

•

Total H₂ output:
o

Clostridium: 0.3 mol/hr × 24 = 7.2 mol/day

o

Rhodobacter: 1.125 mol/hr × 24 = 27 mol/day

o

Total: 34.2 mol H₂/day ≈ 766 L/day

Biofilm Reactor (1 m² Clostridium + 3.7 m² Rhodobacter):
•

Clostridium biofilm: 40 g/m²

•

Rhodobacter biofilm: 18 g/m²

•

Total H₂ output:
o

Clostridium: 0.8 mol/hr × 24 = 19.2 mol/day

o

Rhodobacter: 4 mol/hr × 24 = 96 mol/day

o

Total: 115.2 mol H₂/day ≈ 2581 L/day
115.2

Improvement Factor: 34.2 ≈ 3.37 × 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝐻2 𝑦𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑
This comparison demonstrates that, at equivalent metabolic configurations and substrate
supply, the biofilm system achieves over 3× higher hydrogen yield with superior stability,
scalability, and integration potential.

7. Gas Separation and Post Processing
The dual-stage microbial hydrogen production process yields a gaseous mixture composed
primarily of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), which must be separated efficiently to
preserve product purity and enable sustainable downstream processing. This section
outlines the theoretical gas separation mechanism employed in the model and its associated
assumptions.

7.1. Membrane Separation
The system uses a vacuum-assisted membrane separation module designed to selectively
extract hydrogen from the fermentation headspace. Hydrogen is extracted first due to its
high diffusivity and favourable permeation properties in most polymer membranes. While
molecular size plays a role, effective separation depends on the selectivity of the membrane
material and the partial pressure differential across it. For this model, two classes of
membranes are considered:
•

Polyimide-based membranes: Common in gas separation, offering moderate
H₂/CO₂ selectivity and high mechanical stability.

•

Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs): Emerging materials with tuneable pore sizes
and potentially higher selectivity, modelled here as a theoretical performance
benchmark [5].

Vacuum pressure is applied across the membrane surface to enhance gas flux. The system
is assumed to operate under thermally stable, anaerobic conditions to prevent oxidation and
enzymatic inhibition. While modelled here as perfectly staged and non-overlapping, each
membrane step in real systems results in partial gas mixing. Recirculation loops, pressure
swing adsorption, or cryogenic polishing may be required to achieve the purity assumed in
the current idealized model.
7.1.1. Membrane Lifespan, Degradation, and Fouling Considerations
The gas separation system in this model utilizes semi-permeable vacuum-assisted
membranes for hydrogen and CO₂ extraction. While theoretical performance assumes >95%
separation efficiency, practical implementations face performance drift due to material
degradation, physical stress, and fouling from microbial byproducts.
Key degradation and fouling risks include:
•

Protein Mist Fouling: Fine droplets from active fermentation can condense on
membranes, blocking pores and reducing flow rate.

•

Salt Crystallization: Trace ionic species in the broth may vaporize and deposit on
membranes, especially in long-cycle or high-CO₂ environments.

•

Vacuum Fatigue: Repeated vacuum cycling induces microfractures and pore
deformation, particularly in polymer-based membranes.

•

Acidic Gas Corrosion: CO₂-rich gas streams can lower pH and erode polymeric
layers over multiple cycles if not buffered.

To simplify modelling, this system assumes no membrane replacement within a 72-hour
cycle, with a conservative performance loss margin of ≤5% factored into gas recovery
estimates. For continuous or extended-cycle setups, performance decay should be modelled
dynamically, and membrane health sensors or differential flow detection can be
integrated for predictive maintenance.
Future iterations may benefit from pre-filtration chambers, dedicated gas polishing columns,
and switchable membrane banks for redundancy.
7.1.2. Membrane Throughput Constraints and Gas Flux Limitations
While membrane-based gas separation systems offer scalable selectivity and moderate
energy requirements, real-world performance is ultimately constrained by membrane area,
gas flux rate, and partial pressure differentials. In the current model, gas extraction is treated
as continuous and instantaneous, with all hydrogen produced (12 mol per cycle) assumed to
be removed in real time. However, without quantifying membrane throughput (typically
expressed in Nm³/m²/h/bar), the system risks hydrogen accumulation in the headspace—
potentially surpassing the inhibitory threshold for hydrogenase and nitrogenase activity (~0.6
atm).
To prevent enzymatic suppression, future designs must benchmark membrane surface area,
permeability coefficients, and operational pressure differentials to ensure adequate
volumetric flow rates. If extraction lags gas production, internal feedback inhibition may
compromise yield regardless of stoichiometric potential.
7.1.3. Gas Purity and Post-Separation Polishing
Although the current model assumes hydrogen purity suitable for energy applications, typical
membrane separations alone do not meet the ≥99.97% purity threshold required for polymer
electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Even with a 92% selectivity rate, trace CO₂,
water vapor, and residual metabolites may remain in the product stream. Realistic systems
may therefore require secondary polishing units—such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA),
catalytic oxidation beds, or activated carbon filters—to achieve fuel-grade standards. These
components are omitted from this model but should be considered in lifecycle design for
application-specific deployment.

7.1.4. Backpressure and Vacuum-Induced Stress Considerations
Vacuum-assisted separation introduces negative pressure differentials across the membrane
and reactor headspace. While the model assumes this extraction occurs without disrupting
internal microbial dynamics, real-world systems may experience shear stress on biofilm
surfaces, altered gas solubility, or microbially relevant pressure fluctuations. These shifts
could destabilize biofilm attachment or impair metabolic output. Future iterations should
consider pressure dampeners, buffer chambers, or variable-flow regulators to mitigate these
risks and preserve system integrity during extended operation.

7.2. CO₂ Routing and Sink Options
For theoretical yield benchmarking, this model assumes best-case performance for
membrane gas separation. However, to contextualize feasibility, a realistic performance
corridor is also described below.
•

Hydrogen/CO₂ separation efficiency:
Modelled at 100% for theoretical ceiling, but real-world membrane recovery rates
range from 85–95% depending on material, pore stability, and backpressure control
[Bernardo et al., 2009].

•

Membrane lifespan:
Idealized as indefinite, but real systems experience biofouling, pore compaction,
and selectivity loss over time. Cleaning cycles or replacements every 300–500
hours are common.

•

Vacuum extraction loss:
Assumed lossless, but actual systems incur 5–15% efficiency penalties due to
pump inefficiency, heat loss, or pulsed extraction behaviour.

•

Product purity:
Fuel-grade H₂ is assumed, but in practice polishing steps like pressure swing
adsorption (PSA), activated carbon filters, or moisture traps may be required.

These constraints are not simulated in this model but must be considered for realistic
deployment. Future extensions may incorporate fouling coefficients, separation efficiency
decay curves, and energy cost scaling with purity thresholds.
7.2.1. Yield Impact from Separation Losses
To quantify the effect of real-world membrane inefficiencies on hydrogen recovery, a
comparative energy yield analysis was conducted.
Assumptions:
•

Theoretical H₂ production per cycle = 12 mol

•

Combustion energy per mol H₂ = 286 kJ/mol

•

Ideal separation efficiency = 100%

•

Realistic separation efficiency = 92% (typical for polymer/MOF hybrid membranes)

Energy loss from H₂ capture inefficiency:
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐻2 = 12 𝑚𝑜𝑙 × 0.92 = 11.04 𝑚𝑜𝑙
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 = 11.04 𝑚𝑜𝑙 × 286 𝑘𝐽/𝑚𝑜𝑙 ≈ 3157.4 𝑘𝐽
Compared to the ideal yield of 3432 kJ, this is a loss of 274.6 kJ, or ~8% energy penalty
purely from imperfect gas separation.
Impact on Net Energy Gain: Original net gain = 3432 − 960 = 2472 kJ
Adjusted net gain = 3157.4 − 960 = 2197.4 kJ
→ Net energy drop: ~11.1%
This demonstrates that even modest membrane inefficiencies can meaningfully reduce
system energy balance. For scaled systems, such losses may justify staged membrane
banks or polishing units to preserve fuel-grade output.
7.2.2. CO₂ Recycling Efficiency via Sugarcane Integration
To offset carbon emissions from the dual-stage microbial hydrogen reactor, a photosynthetic
carbon fixation module is proposed using high-efficiency C₄ sugarcane as a biological
sink. This section quantifies the amount of CO₂ released by the system and calculates the
spatial requirements of sugarcane necessary to fully recycle it.
CO₂ Emissions from 5.5 L Reactor
The 5.5 L hydrogen production system comprises:
•

1.0 L Clostridium butyricum chamber

•

3.125 L Rhodobacter sphaeroides chamber

•

~0.375 L for buffering, flow, and headspace

Based on known glucose-to-hydrogen fermentation stoichiometry:
•

Each mole of glucose yields 2 mol CO₂ during dark fermentation

•

The Clostridium stage consumes ~9 mol glucose/day to generate 18 mol H₂

Thus, daily CO₂ output:
9 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝑔𝑙𝑢𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑒/𝑑𝑎𝑦 × 2 = 18 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐶𝑂2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦
18 𝑚𝑜𝑙 × 22.4𝐿/𝑚𝑜𝑙 = 403.2 𝐶𝑂2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦
The Rhodobacter stage contributes negligible CO₂ under ideal photofermentation conditions,
as VFAs are converted to hydrogen and acetate without significant carbon loss.

Sugarcane CO₂ Fixation Capacity
Sugarcane is a high-efficiency C₄ crop with exceptional photosynthetic throughput. In this
model, the sugarcane is cultivated in a controlled greenhouse environment, eliminating
seasonal variation and ensuring consistent CO₂ uptake. Under adequate artificial or solarassisted lighting (10 hours/day), sugarcane leaf tissue fixes CO₂ at a rate of ~32.5
µmol/m²/s. A 5-meter-tall sugarcane plant exhibits a high Leaf Area Index (LAI), estimated
at ~25 due to multiple vertical leaves and overlapping canopies.
Fixation calculation:
32.5𝜇𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑚2 /𝑠 × 36,000 𝑠/𝑑𝑎𝑦 = 1.17 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐶𝑂2 /𝑚2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦
1.17 𝑚𝑜𝑙 × 25 = 29.25 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐶𝑂2 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑/𝑑𝑎𝑦/𝑚2
29.25 𝑚𝑜𝑙 × 22.4 𝐿/𝑚𝑜𝑙 = 655.2 𝐿 𝐶𝑂2 /𝑑𝑎𝑦/𝑚2
Matching Reactor CO₂ Emissions
To neutralize the CO₂ output of the 5.5 L reactor (403.2 L/day):
403.2 ÷ 655.2 = 0.615 𝑚2
Thus, less than 0.62 m² of sugarcane cultivation is needed to offset the entire CO₂ output of
the prototype system.
Conclusion
A small panel of sugarcane (~0.62 m²) with 5-meter stalks is sufficient to fully recycle CO₂
emissions from the 5.5 L hydrogen reactor, achieving net-zero or negative-carbon
operation. This integration confirms the feasibility of biologically closed-loop hydrogen
production at lab and industrial scales when coupled with high-yield carbon-fixing crops.

7.3. System Losses and Gas Fate
This section assumes best-case membrane function for modelling clarity. In real-world
systems, gas separation faces multiple engineering constraints including:
•

Partial pressure gradients that limit flux across membranes.

•

Membrane aging and fouling from bioaerosols or organic residues.

•

Backpressure that could affect gas accumulation rates or microbial equilibrium.

•

Vacuum system inefficiencies, such as pulsed flow, heat buildup, and non-linear
extraction rates.

While these effects are not modelled here, they present clear avenues for future
investigation. For instance, hydrogen recovery efficiencies in real systems often fall between
85–95%, and energy requirements for vacuum pumps scale non-linearly with extraction
volume and purity targets. Additionally, pressure differential stress across biofilms could lead
to microbial adhesion loss or diffusion barriers, requiring pressure dampening designs in
future prototypes. These challenges reinforce the need for experimental membrane
characterization, CFD simulation of gas flow, and pressure-regulated biofilm integration in
scaled systems. Until such data becomes available, the present model defines an upperbound, zero-loss gas separation baseline.
To further clarify the performance gap between the idealized membrane model and realworld system behaviour, this table summarizes critical membrane and vacuum gas handling
parameters, with estimated realistic performance ranges and their impact on system
operation.

8. CO2 Fixation and Redirection Strategy
The dual-stage microbial system yields significant volumes of carbon dioxide as a metabolic
byproduct—estimated at 6 mol CO₂ per mole of glucose, or approximately 264 g CO₂ per
180.16 g glucose, resulting in a CO₂-to-glucose mass ratio of 146.56%. This value exceeds
the substrate mass due to oxygen atoms derived from water during photofermentation
reactions. To maintain environmental sustainability, the model emphasizes redirecting this
CO₂ to biological carbon sinks.

8.1. Candidate Biological Sinks
Three primary biological systems are proposed for CO₂ assimilation:
8.1.1. Sugarcane Plantations (C₄ Crops)
•

High CO₂ fixation rates

•

Dual purpose: sequestration + potential glucose recovery

•

Proven viability in tropical and subtropical zones

8.1.2. Bamboo Forests
•

Among the fastest-growing terrestrial plants

•

High year-round carbon uptake per hectare

•

Suitable for industrial land reclamation or buffer zones

8.1.3. Algae Bioreactors [8]
•

High surface area to volume ratio for CO₂ uptake

•

Suitable for urban, modular, or space-limited deployment

•

Biomass can be harvested for nutrient recovery or biofertilizer.

Other systems like aquatic plant ponds (e.g., duckweed) were explored but deprioritized due
to acidification risks and high maintenance needs for pH stabilization.

8.2. Storage and Transport Assumptions
Separated CO₂ is assumed to be stored at ambient pressure in intermediate buffer tanks
before redirection. No liquefaction or compression is modelled. Transport to biological sinks
is assumed to occur via insulated pipelines or short-range pressure vessels depending on
site layout and distance. These assumptions are idealized and exclude energy or
infrastructure costs.

8.3. Scientific Frustrations and Realism Acknowledgement
While the paper outlines multiple CO₂ fixation strategies, achieving a truly closed-loop
carbon system is far from straightforward. Each sink presents trade-offs:
•

Land-based sinks (sugarcane, bamboo) demand significant space, irrigation, and
land-use planning.

•

Algal systems require strict environmental control (light, nutrients, mixing) and
capital investment.

•

Aquatic sinks, though attractive, suffer from ecosystem acidification without alkaline
buffering.

Moreover, the actual CO₂ uptake efficiency of each system is highly variable and context
dependent. Climate, crop health, microbial symbiosis, and system maintenance all contribute
to sequestration inconsistency.
This section represents a combination of plausible strategies and educated speculation.
While redirecting CO₂ biologically is possible, it is also clear that implementation would
require site-specific optimization, lifecycle cost analysis, and multi-disciplinary collaboration.
The paper emphasizes this limitation as one of the most significant engineering and
ecological challenges in making microbial hydrogen production truly carbon neutral.
8.3.1. Temporal and Lifecycle Constraints in CO₂ Fixation
While this model proposes redirecting CO₂ emissions into high-efficiency biological sinks
such as sugarcane plantations, algae bioreactors, and bamboo forests, it currently treats
these systems as instantaneous and lossless carbon absorbers. In practice, CO₂
fixation is delayed, variable, and biologically constrained by multiple factors:
Factor
Growth Phase
Climate & Light
Nighttime Respiration
Soil and Root Limitations
Algal Turnover

Effect on CO2 Fixation
Young or senescent plants fix less CO₂ than those in peak
growth
Reduced fixation under low light, drought, or temperature
extremes
Plants respire CO₂ during darkness, offsetting net capture
Poor soil health or root stress can limit nutrient uptake,
slowing CO₂ assimilation

Bioreactor systems require regular harvesting or risk CO₂
saturation and stalling

Implication: Even with optimal gas routing, real-time CO₂ absorption may lag emission,
resulting in temporary atmospheric accumulation unless properly buffered.
To address this, future models should include:
•

Lag curves to model sequestration delay vs. emission rate.

•

CO₂ buffer tanks or regulated injection pacing

•

Lifecycle-based tracking of plant biomass carbon retention vs. turnover or decay

Net-zero status should be assessed over longer periods (e.g., weekly/monthly) rather than
per-cycle, acknowledging that biological sinks accumulate CO₂ gradually, not on demand.

8.3.2. Lifecycle Carbon Accounting and Sink Saturation Limitations
While this model treats CO₂ redirection as an environmentally positive strategy, a complete
life-cycle carbon budget remains outside the current scope. Key variables such as plant
respiration, post-harvest biomass decay, transport emissions, and land-use change are not
modelled. As such, carbon neutrality is evaluated at the point of CO₂ injection into the
biological sink, not the full assimilation and retention pathway. This creates a temporal and
spatial mismatch between emission and sequestration, which may be acceptable in shortcycle systems but problematic at industrial scale.
Moreover, all candidate sinks—sugarcane, bamboo, and algae—have upper limits on their
CO₂ fixation capacity. Algae bioreactors, for instance, can become saturated within 24–48
hours if biomass is not harvested regularly, while sugarcane plantations exhibit declining
CO₂ uptake as atmospheric concentrations plateau near the plant’s physiological maximum
(~500 ppm in localized zones). None of these dynamic limitations are currently simulated in
this version of the model.
Future implementations should include saturation response curves, storage buffer
capacities, and CO₂ pacing algorithms to prevent over-saturation, backflow, or temporal CO₂
buildup. This is particularly important in closed loop or semi-autonomous installations where
manual oversight is limited. Additionally, routing infrastructure—assumed here to be lossless
and energetically neutral—should be evaluated for compression costs, leak risk, and
maintenance overhead in long-distance or industrial deployments.
Clarification on Temporal Lag in CO₂ Sequestration:
While this model assumes that carbon dioxide emissions from microbial metabolism are
routed to external biological sinks such as sugarcane plantations or algae bioreactors, it
currently treats sequestration as temporally immediate and lossless. In real ecosystems,
CO₂ uptake is delayed by biological growth cycles, seasonal variation, and environmental
stressors. For example, sugarcane exhibits peak fixation rates only during active vegetative
growth, with significantly reduced carbon assimilation during early growth or senescence
phases. Likewise, algae systems may saturate with CO₂ under suboptimal light or nutrient
depletion, introducing lag between gas delivery and biomass conversion.
Therefore, while the model achieves theoretical carbon neutrality on a per-cycle basis, actual
atmospheric offsetting will occur over extended timescales—days to weeks for algae
systems, and weeks to months for land-based crops. This temporal mismatch may result in
transient CO₂ accumulation unless buffered via intermediate gas storage or throttled
injection rates. Future models should integrate sequestration lag curves and dynamic sink
response profiles to represent net-zero trajectories more accurately over realistic operational

Terminology Note: Distinction Between Biomass Types
In this paper, the term biomass is used in two distinct biological contexts. To avoid
confusion, the following terminology is applied throughout:
•

Microbial Biomass (also referred to as cellular biomass): Refers to the accumulation
of bacterial or phototrophic cell mass during fermentation. This includes protein,
lipids, DNA/RNA, and structural polysaccharides formed from substrate carbon.

•

Plant Biomass (also referred to as sugarcane biomass or CO₂ sink biomass): Refers
to vegetative tissue formed by C₄ plants like sugarcane as part of the system’s
carbon fixation loop.

When yield metrics refer to "biomass diversion" or "Biomass Diversion Factor (BDF)",
they pertain to microbial biomass only—not plant tissue.
This distinction ensures clarity in carbon accounting, resource budgeting, and life-cycle
assessments across both fermentation and sequestration components.

9. Theoretical Results and Yield Modelling
This section consolidates the theoretical stoichiometric outcomes of the dual-stage microbial
hydrogen production system. Calculations are based on idealized assumptions of complete
substrate conversion, lossless gas extraction, and unrestricted enzyme performance.
9.0.1. Unit Legend
To ensure consistency across all energy, yield, and cost metrics presented in this paper, the
following unit conventions are applied:
•

Energy values are expressed in kilojoules (kJ). For readability, values exceeding
1000 kJ are also reported in megajoules (MJ), where:
1 𝑀𝐽 = 1000 𝐾𝐽

•
•
•

•

Hydrogen quantities are provided in both moles (mol) and grams (g). The molar
mass of hydrogen is taken as 2.02 g/mol.
Carbon dioxide (CO₂) outputs are reported in grams (g), based on a molar mass of
44.01 g/mol.
Gas volumes are calculated at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP),
defined in this model as 0°C and 1 atm, with a molar volume of 22.4 L/mol.
Deviations due to temperature and pressure are not modelled in this version.
Cost values are reported in U.S. dollars (USD) and are based on industrial utility
rates and bulk glucose pricing within the United States.

All tables and quantitative outputs from Section 8 onward adopt these units unless
otherwise specified. This standardization supports comparative interpretation, external
benchmarking, and ease of conversion across related studies.

These definitions provide complementary perspectives on system performance,
reflecting both absolute and relative energy returns.

Clarification on Water’s Role:
Water contributes hydrogen atoms, not caloric energy. During photofermentation, water
serves as an electron donor whose hydrogen atoms are split via light-driven nitrogenase
activity. However, this process does not provide chemical energy—only electrons and
protons. Therefore, the system’s entire energy yield originates from glucose oxidation,
even though the total hydrogen yield includes atoms from both glucose and water.
Side Note: While water provides hydrogen atoms for photofermentation via light-driven
nitrogenase activity, it does not contribute any usable energy in the form of enthalpy. The
entire system’s energy output derives from glucose oxidation alone. Any reference to “yield
including water” reflects mass-based input comparisons, not energy sources.
While the total mass input includes both glucose and water, their contributions to energy
output are not equivalent. Glucose serves as the primary energy substrate, whereas water
functions as a hydrogen donor with negligible caloric value but serving as a critical electron
donor in photofermentation. This table clarifies the input components' roles in the system’s
energy yield.
Clarification on Yield Metrics:
While mass yield is a convenient metric for comparing biochemical conversion efficiency,
hydrogen is primarily valued as an energy carrier. Therefore, energy-normalized yields (e.g.,
MJ per mol substrate) provide a more meaningful basis for system benchmarking and
economic comparison. Mass-based values are still included to enable direct comparison with
microbial and enzymatic yield literature, where this format remains common.

9.1.1. H₂ Yield Sensitivity
To illustrate system variability under suboptimal conditions, this table presents a range of
hydrogen yields and their associated energy and efficiency impacts. These values help
define a realistic operating envelope for future system iterations.
Note on Efficiency Units:
All efficiency values in the following table are calculated based on a fixed input energy of
960 kJ per cycle, reflecting the theoretical system energy requirement under ideal
conditions. These values represent apparent system efficiency, assuming consistent
operation time and energy expenditure per batch.
In practical systems, energy input may scale dynamically with process duration, hydrogen
yield, or system throttling. For this reason, a separate table modelling scaled input
efficiency is provided in Section 8.3.2. This distinction ensures clarity between static
efficiency benchmarking and adaptive, yield-dependent energy analysis.

Side Note: For earlier discussion of oxygen contribution from water molecules, see Section

9.2. Modelling Assumptions
•
•
•
•

Full conversion of substrate to desired products
Ideal anaerobic conditions, optimal temperature (37°C), and sufficient light intensity
No gas loss, contamination, or membrane inefficiency
Biofilm performance is spatially uniform.

These theoretical outcomes represent upper-bound estimates. Real-world yields may vary
due to substrate limitations, microbial kinetics, enzyme inhibition, or incomplete gas capture,
all of which are excluded from this model for simplicity and clarity.

9.3. Sensitivity Considerations and Yield Variability
While this model reports a theoretical hydrogen yield of 12 mol H₂ per glucose cycle under
ideal conditions, real-world systems rarely achieve perfect conversion. Key process
variables—including substrate concentration, light intensity, microbial activity, and gas
separation efficiency—can introduce significant variability.
For instance, a 20–30% reduction in photofermentation efficiency (e.g., due to suboptimal
lighting or VFA buildup) would lower total hydrogen yield to ~9–10 mol H₂ per cycle.
Similarly, incomplete CO₂ separation or membrane fouling could reduce effective gas
collection rates, impacting the net energy recovery and skewing cost estimates.
In energy terms, a drop from 12 mol H₂ to 9 mol would reduce gross energy output from
~3.43 MJ to ~2.57 MJ—cutting net energy gain by nearly 25%.
These outcomes highlight the importance of system robustness, adaptive control
mechanisms, and experimental optimization. While this paper establishes a theoretical
upper-bound, future models should incorporate probabilistic ranges, confidence intervals, or
empirical yield curves to better represent operational variability.

These estimates assume proportional diversion of glucose- and VFA-derived carbon into
non-gas biomass structures. This includes amino acids, nucleotides, and structural
polysaccharides. Although the degree of biomass formation depends on nutrient conditions,
reactor cycling, and microbial growth phase, empirical studies support a diversion range of
10–30% in batch systems [3].
Side Note: Adjusted hydrogen yields in this table are derived by estimating carbon diversion
from glucose into microbial biomass. As biomass retains significant substrate carbon, this
diversion directly reduces the number of carbon atoms oxidized to CO₂ during
photofermentation. Since hydrogen production in R. sphaeroides is stoichiometrically linked
to CO₂ evolution, yield losses are approximated proportionally based on carbon retention
assumptions. Further refinement using empirical carbon flux analysis is planned in future
models.

9.3.2.1. Carbon Diversion and Impact on H2 Yield
In the dual-stage model, hydrogen yield is tightly coupled to the oxidation of glucosederived carbon atoms. Each mole of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) contains six carbon atoms. Under
ideal, complete oxidation:
•
•

2 carbon atoms are released as CO₂ during dark fermentation.
The remaining 4 carbon atoms are released during photofermentation of butyric acid.

Because photofermentative hydrogen production by Rhodobacter sphaeroides is
stoichiometrically linked to CO₂ evolution—with an approximate 2:1 molar ratio of H₂ to
CO₂—any carbon retained in biomass instead of being oxidized results in a proportional
loss of H₂ yield.
Hydrogen Yield Equation (BDF-Corrected):
To account for the diversion of substrate carbon into microbial biomass, the following
formula calculates the total hydrogen yield per mole of glucose based on the Biomass
Diversion Factor (BDF).
Let x represent the fraction of carbon atoms from glucose that are diverted to biomass. This
value ranges from 0 (no diversion) to 0.5 (half of all carbon lost to biomass).
In the system:
•
•

Dark fermentation consistently yields 2 mol of hydrogen, unaffected by biomass
diversion.
Photofermentation ideally yields 10 mol of hydrogen, assuming all 4 remaining
carbon atoms from glucose (after dark fermentation) are used to form butyric acid
and are fully oxidized.

However, when biomass diversion occurs, fewer carbon atoms are available for oxidation in
the photofermentation stage. Since 6 carbon atoms exist per glucose molecule and 2 are
always released in dark fermentation, the remaining 4 are subject to diversion.
The number of available carbon atoms for photofermentation becomes: 4 – (6 × x)
This means the actual photofermentation yield is: 10 × (available carbon ÷ 4) = 10 × (1 –
1.5x)
Total hydrogen yield, combining both stages, is then: H₂ yield = 2 + 10 × (1 – 1.5x)
Which simplifies to: H₂ yield = 12 – 15x
Final equation:
Adjusted hydrogen yield = 12 – 15 × BDF
This equation assumes dark fermentation is constant, and photofermentation yield declines
linearly with increasing biomass diversion.

9.3.2.2. Biological Realism Factor (BRF) Adjustment
These values can be combined with the Biomass Diversion Factor (BDF) for layered
correction in scenario modelling. While BRF reflects metabolic inefficiencies even in
optimized strains, BDF represents substrate diversion into biomass structures. Together,
they define a more biologically constrained performance envelope.

9.4. Energy Yield Estimate
Each mole of hydrogen releases ~286 kJ of energy upon combustion. Based on 12 mol H₂
per glucose cycle:
•

Energy yield per mol glucose: 12 × 286 = 3432 kJ, or ~3.43 MJ

This figure assumes complete combustion of hydrogen and no energy loss during storage or
transfer.

10. Net Energy Balance and System Efficiency
To evaluate the practical viability of the proposed dual-stage microbial hydrogen production
system, it is essential to quantify not only the theoretical energy output but also the energy
required to operate the system components. This section outlines a preliminary energy
balance based on stoichiometric hydrogen yield and estimated energy inputs under idealized
bench-scale conditions.

10.1. Hydrogen Energy Output
Under ideal conditions, the system produces 12 mol of H₂ per mole of glucose, resulting in a
gross energy output of:
12 mol × 286 kJ/mol = 3432 kJ (or ~3.43 MJ)
To reflect biological inefficiencies in enzyme expression and metabolic function, a Biological
Realism Factor (BRF) is applied. BRF-scaled energy values are summarized in Table
8.3.2, alongside yield and efficiency adjustments. These corrected values define the
system’s expected energy ceiling under non-ideal operating conditions.

10.2. Estimated Energy Inputs
Energy inputs were estimated based on typical laboratory-scale setups and published
literature. All values assume one full processing cycle (~24 hours) for 1 mole of glucose.

per unit of input energy.

results in useful output.

Clarification: The term "system efficiency" is often misused in biological models. Here, both
EROIE and NEF are reported to clarify different performance aspects:
•
•

EROIE reflects viability from an energy investment perspective.
NEF reflects how much of the total system energy remains in usable form.

10.3. Real-World Expectations
While the theoretical efficiency approaches 80%, practical efficiencies are expected to be
lower. A biomass yield penalty of 5–10% is typically observed in practical systems due to
resource allocation toward microbial maintenance and division. This was excluded from the
current energy model to isolate system performance potential. Based on operational
inefficiencies, microbial kinetics, and engineering limitations, realistic system efficiency
may range between 40–60%. Factors influencing actual performance include:
•
•
•
•
•

Partial pressure and selectivity losses in membrane separation
Biofilm detachment or overgrowth
Incomplete substrate conversion
Heat loss and energy dissipation in control systems.
LED degradation and photon scattering inefficiencies.

These must be addressed in future experimental trials and lifecycle assessments.

varying reactor designs.
10.3.2. Clarifying Efficiency Metrics: Separation Loss vs. Total System Efficiency
The paper currently references two distinct ranges for practical energy efficiency:
•
•

67–72% efficiency — reflecting only gas separation penalties and membrane
inefficiencies under ideal microbial performance.
40–60% efficiency — reflecting full-system inefficiencies including microbial losses,
biomass diversion, expression instability, and light/mass transfer limitations.

The higher value (67–72%) assumes microbes operate near their theoretical ceiling, and the
only losses occur in gas handling.
The lower value (40–60%) reflects real-world biological constraints such as:
•
•
•
•

BRF-adjusted expression losses
Biomass carbon diversion (BDF)
ATP or cofactor bottlenecks
Incomplete substrate conversion

Conclusion: When quoting system efficiency, it is essential to specify which domain the
losses originate from. Future empirical models should separately quantify:
•
•

Engineering penalties (e.g., membrane loss, pump inefficiency)
Biological penalties (e.g., yield suppression, carbon retention) to provide a more
precise picture of overall energy performance.

Gas Separation Penalty
Real-world membrane systems rarely achieve perfect separation. With a hydrogen recovery
efficiency of ~92% and vacuum pump efficiency of ~90%, two energy penalties must be
considered:
•
•

Hydrogen Loss (~275 kJ): Due to unrecovered hydrogen molecules during
membrane passage, reducing usable gas output.
Vacuum Operation Cost (~216 kJ): Represents the power required to run the
vacuum pump, even under efficient cycling.

Together, these factors reduce the theoretical energy output of 3432 kJ per cycle by a total
of ~491 kJ, resulting in an adjusted net energy gain of ~1960–2200 kJ, depending on
membrane and vacuum system efficiency. This corresponds to a practical energy efficiency
of 67–72%, compared to the theoretical maximum of 78.1%.
These adjustments reinforce the importance of staged membrane arrays, fouling resistance,
and supplemental polishing technologies (e.g., PSA or desiccant traps) for maintaining fuelgrade output.

Clarified Statement on Gas Separation Losses and Energy Penalty
In the original model, the energy penalty from gas separation was expressed as a drop in
usable hydrogen energy—from 3432 kJ (theoretical) to ~3157 kJ (realistic), amounting to an
8% loss. This value includes both the loss of hydrogen due to imperfect membrane
selectivity (typically 5–10% unrecovered gas) and the energy required to operate the
vacuum extraction system (216 kJ per cycle based on 30W pump usage for 2 hours).
It is important to distinguish between these two contributors:
•
•

Gas Loss Penalty (~274 kJ): Represents the portion of hydrogen that diffuses
inefficiently or is unrecovered during membrane separation.
Vacuum Energy Cost (216 kJ): Represents the energetic overhead of powering the
extraction system.

Clarification on Energy Penalty Attribution:
The total energy penalty from the gas separation system is composed of two distinct
components that must be treated separately:
1. Hydrogen Loss Penalty (~275 kJ): This represents the reduction in usable energy
output due to membrane inefficiency—i.e., hydrogen gas that escapes capture and is
therefore unavailable for combustion.
2. Vacuum Pump Energy Input (~216 kJ): This is an operational energy cost,
representing the power required to run the membrane extraction system during gas
separation.
These values should not be combined into a single energy loss from the output stream,
as they affect different sides of the energy balance equation:
•
•

The hydrogen loss reduces gross energy output:
3432 kJ → 3157 kJ usable H₂ energy.
The vacuum pump cost adds to system input energy:
Total input = 960 kJ (including 216 kJ from vacuum system)

Therefore, the net energy gain remains:
•
•

Net energy = 3157 − 960 = 2197 kJ
Real-world system efficiency ≈ 64% (2197 / 3432)

This refined breakdown avoids double-counting and accurately distinguishes between
energy losses due to system inefficiency and energy costs due to system operation.
Side Note: Yield values assuming 10 mol H₂ from photofermentation reflect a best-case ATP
supply scenario. Under energy-limited conditions, ATP throttling may reduce this to 7.5–9
mol, resulting in cycle yields of ~9.5–11 mol H₂ and a corresponding drop in energy output
and system EROIE.

11. Production Rate and Daily Throughput
To contextualize the system's practicality and operational output, this section presents a
normalized daily breakdown of production, energy output, and carbon emissions based on a
complete reactor cycle duration of 72 hours (3 days).

11.1. Cycle Duration Justification
The proposed system operates through a sequential two-stage microbial process:
11.1.1. Stage 1: Dark Fermentation (Clostridium butyricum)
•
•
•
•

Converts glucose into hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
Doubling time: ~3–6 hours
Hydrogen production typically peaks at 18–24 hours post-inoculation.
Full substrate conversion is generally achieved within 24 hours in batch mode.

11.1.2. Stage 2: Photofermentation (Rhodobacter sphaeroides)
•
•
•
•

Converts VFAs into additional hydrogen via nitrogenase-driven metabolism.
Process is light-dependent and slower.
Photofermentation typically requires 2–5 days depending on light intensity and VFA
concentration.
Butyric acid breakdown extends total time requirements.

Based on this information, the full operating cycle is reasonably assumed to require
approximately 72 hours (3 days).

Side Note: Hydrogen volume assumes STP = 22.4 L/mol at 0°C and 1 atm. Real values may
vary depending on operational temperature and pressure.

11.3. Hydrogen Productivity Rate (Volume-Based)
Assuming a 2-litre total working reactor volume:
•
•

Hydrogen output/day = 89.7 L / 2 L = 44.85 L H₂ per litre of reactor per day
Energy output/day = 1144 kJ / 2 L = 572 kJ per litre per day

These values represent an idealized productivity scenario under fully optimized and stable
microbial activity. Real-world rates may vary based on inoculum density, substrate purity,
light intensity, and ambient conditions.

Note on Gas Volume Calculations:
All hydrogen volume values in this paper are calculated assuming Standard Temperature
and Pressure (STP) defined as:
•
•
•

0°C (273.15 K)
1 atm pressure (101.325 kPa)
Molar volume of 22.4 L/mol

If operating conditions differ (e.g., 25°C or pressurized storage), gas volume may vary
accordingly. For precision applications, corrected volumes using the Ideal Gas Law or real
gas equations should be applied.

11.4. Microbial Biomass Yield Efficiency
Literature on Clostridium butyricum batch fermentation systems commonly report dry
biomass concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 g/L, depending on substrate load, nutrient
availability, and anaerobic conditions. For this model, a conservative estimate of 2.0 g/L was
assumed, consistent with OD₆₀₀ values of ~1.5–2.0 reported in microbial hydrogen
production studies.
Assuming a working bioreactor volume of 2 litres—representative of a lab-scale system
operating at full aqueous capacity—the total microbial dry biomass is estimated at 4.0
grams. Under these conditions, the reactor yields:
•
•

1.0 mol H₂ per gram of biomass per day
0.5 mol CO₂ per gram of biomass per day

This productivity aligns with the theoretical ceiling. Literature reports 0.15–0.75 mol/g/day
depending on strain and light conditions. This model assumes optimized conditions and
gene stack expression without metabolic burden.
Side Note: This system-wide production rate of ~4 mol H₂/day corresponds to a microbial
biomass concentration of 2 g/L across 2 L of working volume. At this biomass level,
approximately 5–15% of substrate carbon is redirected toward cellular material. This
supports the application of a Biomass Diversion Factor in overall yield and energy
calculations (see Section 8.2.2). Section 9.4 provides the biomass-normalized rates derived
from this same baseline (1.0 mol H₂/g biomass/day and 0.5 mol CO₂/g biomass/day),
ensuring direct alignment between overall gas output and microbial load.

11.5. Implications for Scale-Up
This daily throughput model allows for direct scalability calculations. For example:
•

A 100-litre reactor system (assuming same conditions) would yield:
o ~8.97 m³ H₂/day
o ~114.4 MJ/day
o ~8.8 kg CO₂/day

Such normalized values are essential for evaluating deployment potential across
decentralized grids, small-scale industrial applications, or off-grid energy systems with
integrated carbon management strategies.

12. CO2 Redirection to Passive Sugarcane Sink
To ensure net-zero emissions and maintain the system’s carbon-neutral profile, the carbon
dioxide produced by microbial metabolism is redirected into a dedicated sugarcane
greenhouse or plantation pod adjacent to the reactor setup.

12.1. Daily CO₂ Emissions
Based on stoichiometric fermentation pathways, the system emits:
•
•

6 mol CO₂ per cycle = 264 g CO₂ per 3 days
Average per day = 2 mol CO₂ ≈ 88 grams/day

12.2. Sugarcane CO₂ Fixation Capacity
Sugarcane is a high-efficiency C₄ photosynthetic crop known for rapid carbon uptake.
•
•

Literature indicates sugarcane can fix ~666 g CO₂ per kg of biomass produced.
Required CO₂ offset: 88 g/day.

Required sugarcane growth per day:
88 𝑔
≈ 0.132 𝑘𝑔 = 132 𝑔 𝑠𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑒/𝑑𝑎𝑦
666 𝑔/𝑘𝑔
This requirement is modest and achievable in a small indoor greenhouse pod or planterscale setup, especially under controlled light and nutrient conditions. Even minimal
vegetative growth is sufficient to fully offset the reactor’s daily CO₂ emissions.
12.2.1. Why Sugarcane?
Sugarcane offers two-fold advantages:
1. Exceptional CO₂ fixation due to its C₄ metabolic pathway
2. Glucose-rich stalks make it a compatible future feedstock for microbial
fermentation.
This symbiotic potential means that the same crop used for carbon offset could eventually be
harvested to support future reactor cycles, contributing to a semi-closed bioresource loop.

12.3 Temporal Dynamics of CO₂ Fixation
While the daily CO₂ emission from microbial fermentation is estimated at ~88 g/day, the
corresponding fixation by sugarcane biomass (~132 g/day growth for offset) assumes a
smoothed average over an extended photoperiod and seasonal cycle. Sugarcane growth is
not linear or instantaneous; it follows diurnal patterns and growth-phase-dependent rates
influenced by light exposure, nutrient levels, and ambient conditions.
Therefore, the CO₂ fixation rate cited here represents an averaged sequestration
benchmark, not a real-time sink. In practice, temporal mismatches between gas production
and biological absorption may occur—particularly during early germination, cloudy periods,
or seasonal dormancy.

To mitigate these mismatches, future designs could incorporate:
•
•
•

Buffer tanks to store CO₂ until peak uptake hours.
Multi-species sink systems (e.g., algae + sugarcane) for temporal balancing.
Monitoring and throttle protocols based on plant health and CO₂ levels.

This correction ensures the system’s carbon neutrality is evaluated on a rolling timescale,
not instantaneously. Accurate life-cycle sequestration tracking is essential for long-term
deployment and ecological verification.

Author’s Note: The Industrial Concern
While this model proposes a sustainable and ecologically integrated CO₂ management
strategy, it is important to acknowledge a concern: industrial-scale implementations may
not uphold the passive offset system. For economic or spatial reasons, CO₂ redirection
could be bypassed or ignored, undermining the environmental integrity of the design.
Therefore, responsible implementation must treat CO₂ fixation as a non-optional
component, not merely a sustainability add-on. Without it, the system reverts to a netpositive carbon emitter, contradicting its intended purpose.

13. CO₂ Sink Implementation and Maintenance Considerations
The efficacy of the proposed microbial hydrogen production system relies not only on
hydrogen output but also on the successful redirection and neutralization of byproduct CO₂.
This section addresses the physical deployment, delivery method, and oversight
mechanisms associated with the sugarcane-based carbon sink.

13.1. Physical Setup: Sugarcane Pod Location
The sugarcane plants are assumed to be grown within a dedicated greenhouse pod or
adjacent indoor soil-based chamber. This setting allows for year-round growth under
controlled temperature, humidity, and light conditions. Soil-based planting is prioritized over
hydroponics to simplify nutrient cycling and reduce technological overhead. The pod is
spatially integrated to minimize gas transfer distance.

13.2. CO₂ Transfer Mechanism
CO₂ generated during fermentation is captured via membrane separation and routed into the
sugarcane pod through low-pressure, gas-tight tubing. Dispersion strategies include:
•
•

Atmospheric diffusion: Gas is released into the plant chamber for natural
absorption.
Root-zone injection: CO₂ is directed into soil channels for partial dissolution and
uptake.

For bench-scale systems, passive atmospheric mixing is likely sufficient.

13.3. Maintenance and Oversight
To prevent CO₂ buildup due to plant failure or neglect, future-scale systems may include:
•
•
•

CO₂ sensors in the exhaust loop or pod
Automatic throttling or shutdown if CO₂ thresholds are exceeded.
Optional health monitoring of sugarcane growth using basic spectral sensors.

These features ensure carbon sequestration remains enforced, not optional.

13.4. Ethical and Industrial Caution
While the passive CO₂ sink model is designed for simplicity and reliability, there is a tangible
risk that industrial-scale adopters may attempt to omit or disable the sequestration
component to reduce costs or footprint. Such practices would fundamentally undermine the
system’s sustainability claims and revert it to a net-emitter.
To avoid this outcome, system deployment should be guided by strict sustainability protocols
that include the carbon sink as a non-optional element of the hydrogen production
framework. Long-term success hinges not only on microbial efficiency, but also on upholding
the environmental intent of the design.

14. Kinetic Considerations and Theoretical Modelling Framework
14.1. Objective of Kinetics Modelling
While stoichiometric analysis provides a snapshot of theoretical yield, it lacks the temporal
resolution required to optimize real-world reactor performance. Kinetic modelling addresses
this gap by characterizing the rate at which biochemical transformations occur under
varying environmental and operational conditions.
In the context of this dual-stage microbial hydrogen system, kinetics modelling serves the
following key purposes:
•
•
•
•
•

Predicting hydrogen production rates over time for each microbial stage
Identifying limiting factors, such as substrate saturation, product inhibition, or light
flux variability
Optimizing substrate feeding strategies to avoid bottlenecks or microbial shock
Enabling scale-up modelling through time-dependent simulations of batch and
continuous systems
Supporting future automation by providing a framework for real-time feedback
control

By introducing kinetic parameters into the system framework, the model transitions from a
static yield estimate to a dynamic, time-resolved process capable of iterative refinement and
control.

14.3. Dark Fermentation Kinetics (Clostridium butyricum)
The dark fermentation stage, facilitated by Clostridium butyricum, is responsible for the initial
conversion of glucose into hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). This process can be
described using Monod kinetics, which relate microbial growth or substrate consumption
rate to substrate concentration:
𝑟 = 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥

[𝑆]
𝐾𝑠 + [𝑆]

Where:
•
•
•
•

𝑟: Rate of glucose consumption or hydrogen production
𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 : Maximum rate under saturated conditions
[𝑆]: Substrate concentration (glucose)
𝐾𝑠 : Half-Saturation constant

In specific conditions, substrate inhibition may occur at high glucose concentrations. This
can be modelled by extended forms such as the Haldane equation to reflect non-linear
inhibition kinetics.

14.3.1. Example Calculation using Empirical Parameters
Based on reported kinetic data for Clostridium butyricum, the following parameters were
selected for modelling hydrogen production via Monod kinetics [Khanal et al., 2018]:
•
•
•

𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 14.92 𝑑𝑎𝑦 −1 (max growth rate)
𝐾𝑠 = 1.02 𝑔 𝐶𝑂𝐷/𝐿 (substrate affinity)
[𝑆] = 1.5 𝑔 𝐶𝑂𝐷/𝐿 (Glucose feed concentration assumed

Substituting into Monod equation:
𝑟 = 14.92 ×

1.5
= 14.92 × 0.595 = 8.87 𝑑𝑎𝑦 −1
1.02 + 1.5

Thus, under these conditions, the system achieves a glucose-specific growth rate of 8.87
day⁻¹, indicating strong substrate utilization.

14.4. Photofermentation Kinetics (Rhodobacter sphaeroides)
Due to the lack of real-time experimental data for photofermentation kinetics, light-saturation
modelling is presented using standard literature values for similar strains under ideal lab
conditions. These values are included solely for theoretical demonstration.
The second stage involves Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which uses VFAs produced during
dark fermentation to generate additional hydrogen via photofermentation. This process is
primarily limited by light intensity and substrate availability. The rate of hydrogen
production can be approximated using light-dependent kinetics:
𝑟 = 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝐼
𝐾𝐼 + 𝐼

Where:
•
•

𝐼: Incident light intensity (µmol photons/m²/s)
𝐾𝐼 : Light saturation constant

In addition to light, nitrogenase enzyme activity and VFA accumulation influence the overall
rate. Optimization may require tuning light exposure profiles and avoiding product buildup
that inhibits microbial metabolism.
14.4.1. Example Calculation using Empirical Parameters
Light-dependent kinetics of Rhodobacter sphaeroides were modelled using data from
Thaiwong et al. (2015), which report:
•
•
•

Optimal light intensity: 7500 lux
𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 = ~12.0 𝑚𝑙 𝐻2 /𝐿 · ℎ = 0.288 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐻2 /𝐿/𝑑𝑎𝑦
𝐾𝐼 (Estimated light half-saturation constant): ~4500 lux.

Assuming light intensity 𝐼 = 6000 lux:
𝑟 = 0.288 ×

6000
= 0.288 × 0.571 = 0.164 𝑚𝑜𝑙 𝐻2 /𝐿/𝑑𝑎𝑦
4500 + 6000

This rate reflects mid-range illumination conditions achievable in bioreactor systems with
LED panels.

Side Note: These empirical parameters are context-dependent and vary based on reactor
design, inoculum age, and light delivery systems. They are presented here to demonstrate
integration of real-world kinetics into the model framework.

14.5. Coupled Kinetic Modelling
To simulate the full dual-stage reactor dynamically, the two microbial stages can be coupled
in a sequential or semi-continuous configuration. The output of the first stage (VFAs)
becomes the input substrate for the second stage. An ODE-based model can be
constructed to track glucose degradation, VFA production, and hydrogen evolution over
time:
•
•
•

Let 𝐺(𝑡): Glucose concentration over time.
Let 𝑉(𝑡): Volatile fatty acid concentration.
Let 𝐻(𝑡): Hydrogen yield curve.

Differential equations can describe rates of change in each metabolite pool and be fitted
using experimental time-course data in future implementations.

14.6. Limitations and Future Directions
While the proposed kinetic framework outlines a theoretical basis for dynamic system
modelling, it currently lacks empirical validation. Parameters such as 𝐾𝑠 , 𝐾𝐼 , and 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 are not
specified due to the absence of real-time growth or yield curve data. Future experimental
studies are needed to:
•
•
•

Calibrate model parameters using actual fermentation trials.
Validate system response to variable substrate concentrations and light conditions.
Develop predictive tools for system control and optimization.

These kinetic models are not intended as predictive tools in their current form. Rather, they
provide a foundation for rate-dependent system refinement once empirical data becomes
available.
Nonetheless, the inclusion of a kinetic modelling framework establishes the groundwork for
advancing this hydrogen production system toward real-time performance tuning and
intelligent reactor control.

15. Cost Efficiency Estimate and Benchmarking
To assess economic feasibility, an approximate cost breakdown was developed for a single
hydrogen production cycle under bench-scale operation, assuming U.S.-based pricing
standards [6,7].
15.1. U.S. Cost Assumptions:
•
•
•

Electricity: $0.10 per kWh (industrial rate)
Glucose (bulk, biotech-grade): ~$2 per kg
Membrane unit: $100, amortized over 500 cycles.

Side Note: This cost does not include polishing units or membrane cleaning cycles. If
membrane lifetime drops below 300 cycles due to fouling or efficiency loss, per-cycle costs
increase to ~$0.33, with added energy penalties for vacuum inefficiency and purity
upgrades.
15.3. Cost per Energy Unit:
Based on the total operational cost of $0.637 per cycle, the system’s theoretical cost
efficiency can be calculated relative to hydrogen energy output.
At the theoretical maximum (12 mol H₂), the system yields 3.43 MJ of energy:
Cost per MJ H₂ = $0.637 / 3.43 ≈ $0.186/MJ
Cost per mol H₂ = $0.637 / 12 mol ≈ $0.053/mol H₂
To incorporate metabolic inefficiencies, the Biological Realism Factor (BRF) is applied to
simulate performance under non-ideal conditions:

These figures highlight how cost efficiency degrades as enzyme activity and metabolic

even though per-cycle expenses remain constant. This reinforces the importance of genetic
stability, expression fidelity, and process control in maintaining economically viable
operation.

the model suggests a strong potential for competitive deployment in decentralized,
sustainable energy frameworks.

Discussion
the potential for significantly higher theoretical hydrogen yields compared to conventional
single-stage fermentation approaches. By coupling Clostridium butyricum-driven dark
fermentation with Rhodobacter sphaeroides-based photofermentation, the model achieves a
projected output of 12 mol H₂ per cycle, corresponding to 13.45% hydrogen by mass relative
to glucose input, or 8.41% when including water. This yield exceeds the typical range
reported for unoptimized single-stage systems, which average between 2–4 mol H₂/mol
glucose.
These results are based on several idealized assumptions, including near-complete
substrate conversion, stable enzymatic activity, and minimal gas separation losses under
optimal conditions. In practice, factors such as membrane fouling, product inhibition, and
microbial fluctuations are likely to introduce performance variability. The system also
assumes that genetically engineered strains express target modifications without loss of
function, mutation, or metabolic interference. While such assumptions serve to establish an
upper-bound performance model, real-world implementation will require extensive
refinement to address system complexity and variability.
The inclusion of kinetic modelling offers deeper insight into microbial behaviour under
dynamic conditions. By quantifying stage-specific reaction rates, the model allows for
predictive simulations and real-time control strategies in future implementations.
Furthermore, the carbon mitigation strategy, when paired with sensor-driven fail-safes,
ensures that CO₂ sequestration remains an enforced requirement rather than an ethical
suggestion. While the sugarcane-based sink is practical at bench scale, scalability will
require protocol standardization to prevent industrial misuse or neglect.
In particular, the bioreactor architecture—though optimized on paper—presents multiple
engineering challenges, including the stabilization of microbial biofilms, maintenance of
anaerobic conditions, controlled light penetration, and non-intrusive gas extraction. The
integration of vacuum-assisted membrane separation, while theoretically viable, must be
evaluated against pressure regulation constraints, energy demands, and potential effects on
microbial health and adhesion.
Furthermore, the CO₂ redirection strategy introduces its own set of complications. While
biological sinks such as sugarcane, bamboo forests, and algae bioreactors offer promising
carbon offset potential, their practical deployment is highly dependent on land use, climate,
nutrient demand, and economic scalability. The feasibility of using CO₂ as a renewable
feedstock hinge on localized resource availability and system compatibility, both of which
remain unresolved in this theoretical model.
Despite these limitations, the study establishes a foundation for future work in genetically
assisted, bioreactor-integrated hydrogen systems. It highlights key areas for experimental
validation, including gene expression profiling, pathway stability, reactor material
compatibility, and gas separation hardware design. Additional work is needed to model
microbial kinetics, energy efficiency, and biofilm lifespan under continuous operation.
In summary, this model offers a high-yield conceptual framework for decentralized, carbon
conscious hydrogen production, while acknowledging that practical application will require
interdisciplinary advances in synthetic biology, bioprocess engineering, and environmental
systems integration.

Scope of Integration and Original Contributions
This study builds upon established research in microbial hydrogen production by proposing a
dual-stage system that integrates dark and photofermentation, gas separation, and CO₂
fixation into a unified conceptual framework. While the individual components used are not
novel, the specific arrangement and application context offer a potentially original
contribution.
To the best of the author's knowledge, the following features are not currently documented in
the literature as a single integrated system:
(A) While prior systems have explored dual-stage microbial hydrogen production, this
reactor introduces gravity-fed passive transfer between stratified biofilms without active
circulation, simplifying system mechanics while preserving metabolic continuity. This design
seeks to simplify operational complexity while maintaining metabolic continuity.
(B) The coupling of microbial CO₂ emissions to a modular sugarcane-based carbon sink
intended not only for sequestration, but for future glucose regeneration and system looping.
While sugarcane is known for carbon capture, its role as a passive CO₂ sink within a
microbial hydrogen system is, as far as the author is aware, not reported.
These features are presented as exploratory design contributions aimed at improving system
modularity, passive control, and long-term sustainability. Further literature review and peer
dialogue may reveal comparable systems, in which case this work still serves to formalize
and extend such ideas in a structured, quantitative model.
While recent electrochemical DAC systems such as the fluoflavine-based redox sorbent
(April 2025) demonstrate improved oxygen tolerance and partial reversibility, their lack of a
defined downstream CO₂ utilization pathway severely limits practical integration. In contrast
to biological systems, which inherently incorporate carbon fixation and valorisation (e.g.,
glucose synthesis, biomass generation), such redox DACs isolate CO₂ only to re-release it
following energy-intensive regeneration. Without a metabolic or synthetic coupling
mechanism, these systems risk functioning as carbon delay mechanisms rather than true
sinks. The present architecture explicitly addresses this limitation by embedding CO₂ into a
biological recycling loop via C₄ plant integration and microbial fermentation, enabling a
closed carbon-energy cycle that produces usable hydrogen gas as output. The system
presented here treats CO₂ not as waste to be held, but as a metabolic resource to be
converted—a distinction absents from non-valorised DAC implementations. In short,
capture without transformation does not constitute mitigation.

Conclusion
This paper has outlined a theoretical dual-stage microbial hydrogen production system
combining dark fermentation by Clostridium butyricum with photofermentation by
Rhodobacter sphaeroides. By leveraging genetically optimized strains and integrating CO₂
redirection to high-efficiency sinks, the model achieves a theoretical ceiling of 12 mol H₂ per
glucose cycle—equivalent to ~3.43 MJ of energy.
Key architectural features, including scaffolded biofilms, vacuum-assisted gas separation,
and modular environmental control systems, are designed to maximize yield under idealized
conditions. The framework introduces correction factors such as the Biological Realism
Factor (BRF) and Biomass Diversion Factor (BDF) to adjust for non-ideal behaviour, offering
a spectrum of operational outcomes from best-case scenarios to realism-aligned estimates.
Despite its theoretical robustness, the model acknowledges several unresolved challenges:
•
•
•
•

Enzyme inhibition under H₂ accumulation
Genetic stack incompatibility and regulatory crosstalk
ATP insufficiency in photofermentation stages
Realistic gas separation throughput and purity demands.

The proposed system serves as a conceptual benchmark rather than a blueprint for
immediate deployment. It establishes an upper-bound performance envelope for
decentralized biohydrogen generation and invites further empirical testing, kinetic modelling,
and bioreactor optimization. The goal is to inform scalable, sustainable alternatives to fossilfuel-derived hydrogen—rooted in biological efficiency and circular carbon integration.

Future Work
To transition this theoretical framework into an experimentally validated system, the following
research directions are recommended:
Empirical Validation of Genetic Stacks
•

Evaluate individual and stacked gene edits in C. butyricum and R. sphaeroides for
stability, yield, and ATP burden under continuous culture.

Dynamic ATP Budget and Cofactor Modelling
•

Apply flux balance analysis (FBA) or dFBA to quantify resource allocation and
identify limiting nodes in the energy network, particularly for nitrogenase ATP
demands.

Photofermentation Surface Area Optimization
•

Simulate light attenuation in 3D biofilm geometries to determine minimum surface
area per litre for optimal yield, especially under low-light or compact designs.

Headspace Gas Kinetics and Inhibition Prevention
•

Model partial pressure build-up, membrane throughput, and gas removal rates in real
time to prevent enzymatic feedback inhibition.

Pilot-Scale Bioreactor Prototyping
•

Construct and evaluate a benchtop or microfluidic version of the dual-chamber
reactor with real gas separation and CO₂ routing to verify assumptions on yield,
thermal stability, and biofilm integrity.

CO₂ Sink Responsiveness and Climate Sensitivity
•

Evaluate how sugarcane, algae, or bamboo sinks perform under varied climate
zones, soil conditions, and CO₂ loading rates, and simulate adaptive control loops.

These tasks will determine the feasibility of translating theoretical yields into real-world
outputs, guiding the development of robust, decentralized hydrogen systems for energy
resilience and climate alignment.

The model’s modular architecture allows these extensions to be implemented progressively.
Future iterations will prioritize dynamic ATP modelling, trace metal limitations, and integrated
pressure control simulations as first-tier improvements.
Future implementation will incorporate COBRApy-based FBA simulations or similar genomescale constraint solvers for Clostridium and Rhodobacter strains to dynamically resolve flux
bottlenecks under BRF and GSCF regimes.
