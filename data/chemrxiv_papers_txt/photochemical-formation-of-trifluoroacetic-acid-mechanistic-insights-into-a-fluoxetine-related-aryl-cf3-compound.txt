ABSTRACT

14

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant; however, its sources are

15

poorly constrained. One understudied source is from the photochemical reactions of aromatic

16

compounds containing −CF3 moieties (aryl-CF3) including many pharmaceuticals and

17

agrochemicals. Here, we studied the aqueous photochemistry of 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol (4-

18

TFMP), a known transformation product of the pharmaceutical fluoxetine. When exposed to

19

lamps centred at UV-B, 4-TFMP formed up to 9.2% TFA at steady state under acidic conditions

20

and 1.3% under alkaline conditions. TFA yields of fluoxetine were similar to 4-TFMP for acidic

21

and neutral pH, but higher at alkaline pH, suggesting fluoxetine may have a mechanism of TFA

22

formation in addition to via the 4-TFMP intermediate. Use of a 13CF3 isotopologue of 4-TFMP

23

allowed for the tracking of TFA formation, which formed via multiple oxidative additions prior

24

to oxidative ring cleavage. The oxidation is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)

25

generated through self-sensitized photolysis, with singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals as the

26

key ROS. In addition to the TFA formation mechanism, other photochemical reactions of 4-

27

TFMP resulted in defluorination and dimerization. Overall, this work expands the

INTRODUCTION

37

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a very persistent and very mobile pollutant ubiquitously present

38

in the environment.1–7 TFA is the smallest analogue of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, and

39

according to the OECD definition, is classified as a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance

40

(PFAS).8,9 Reported TFA concentrations in environmental matrices are often higher than other

41

PFAS,3,4,7 with rapid increases observed since the 1990s.2,5,6,10 This raises concerns about its

42

accumulation in ecosystems and potential human exposure. Although TFA is less

43

bioaccumulative in mammals compared to longer-chain PFAS, it can be uptaken and

44

accumulated by plants.11,12 Due to its hydrophilic and mobile nature, TFA is challenging to

45

remove from water, allowing it to migrate into drinking water supplies. 13,14 In 2016-2017,

46

Scheurer et al. found surprisingly high concentrations of TFA (>100 μg/L) during screening of

47

potable and surface waters in south-west Germany.13 Neuwald et al. reported TFA as the most

48

predominant PFAS in German drinking water sources, with a maximum concentration of 12.4

49

μg/L.15 In an investigation of drinking water in U.S. home, Zheng et al. found that TFA was the

50

predominant PFAS with the median concentration of 79 ng/L and a 95% detection frequency.7

51

TFA has many known direct and indirect environmental sources. However, environmental

52

levels of TFA exceed estimations based on both direct emissions of TFA and of known

53

precursors, indicating the existence of uncharacterized sources.16 A well-identified source of

54

TFA is from atmospheric oxidation of fluorinated gases including hydrofluorocarbons and

55

hydrofluoroolefins.17,18 Other sources include thermolysis of fluoropolymers and oxidation of

56

some longer-chain PFAS.19–21 An additional known and further speculated class of TFA

57

precursors are compounds containing aromatic CF3 functional groups, referred to as aryl-CF3.

58

Modern chemistry incorporates fluorine into pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals to

59

enhance their properties and performance.22 Since the 1950s, fluorine has been integrated into

60

these compounds in various forms, including aryl-CF3.23 Examples include the antidepressant

61

fluoxetine, the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), and the herbicide

62

oxyfluorfen. These compounds enter the environment from different point and nonpoint sources,

63

such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) when not effectively removed or mineralized,

64

direct emissions (e.g. TFM directly used in the Great Lakes), and agricultural runoff (e.g.

65

herbicides and pesticides). For instance, fluoxetine is not efficiently removed in WWTPs and

66

is detected in surface waters at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 ng/L. 24 Once in the

67

environment, aryl-CF3 present in sunlit waters may undergo photochemical reactions. Previous

68

research indicates that defluorination of the −CF3 moiety is a major pathway for the photolysis

69

of aryl-CF3 (i.e. C−CF3 to C−COOH).25 However, depending on aqueous pH and substituents

70

on the aromatic ring, TFA can also be formed.26–28 Early laboratory studies by Ellis & Mabury

71

showed that TFM can photochemically form TFA and undergo photo-defluorination via two

72

competing pH-dependent pathways: defluorination is always the favored pathway, becoming

73

more dominant at higher pH, while lower pH enhances the formation of TFA.26 TFA formation

74

has also been observed in more recent research on the direct and indirect photolysis of

75

fluoxetine.27,29 Despite these efforts, reaction kinetics and TFA yield under different pH

76

conditions and the mechanism of TFA formation are not sufficiently characterized. To the best

77

of our knowledge, except for the early study on the photolysis of TFM,26 no intermediates have

78

been reported nor mechanism proposed for the formation of TFA from any aryl-CF3, which is

79

expected to include oxidative cleavage of the aromatic ring.

80

To understand the formation of TFA from some aryl-CF3 compounds, we investigated the

81

aqueous photolysis of a probe aryl-CF3 compound, 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol (4-TFMP) under

82

different pH conditions. 4-TFMP was selected because it is a well-known transformation

83

product (TP) of fluoxetine,29–31 and has long been hypothesized to be the key intermediate in

84

the photochemical formation of TFA, yet the mechanism of TFA formation has not been

85

elucidated.27,29 We determined the reaction kinetics and steady state TFA molar yield (TFAss%),

86

which represents the total potential of the 4-TFMP to release TFA. Furthermore, we aimed to

87

elucidate the mechanism leading to TFA formation by identifying TPs and by characterizing

88

the possible self-sensitized photochemistry.

89

Stable isotope labeling (SIL) uses stable isotopes (e.g. deuterium and carbon-13) to label

90

compounds and track their TPs.32 In high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis,

91

labeled TPs can be easily distinguished by mass spectrometry due to the mass difference

92

introduced. Several groups have investigated the environmental fate or biotransformation of

93

stable isotope-labeled pollutants, such as 13C-labeled poly(butylene succinate) and 2H-labeled

94

6PPD and 6PPD-quinone.33–35 Inspired by SIL, an in-house synthesized 13CF3-labeled 4-TFMP

95

(13CF3-4-TFMP) was used to track the 13CF3-TFA (13CF3COOH) formation and to help identify

96

13

97

hypothesized that 13CF3-TFA would be generated during the photolysis of 13CF3-4-TFMP.

98

Furthermore, we proposed that in the pathway from 13CF3-4-TFMP to 13CF3-TFA, key

99

intermediates would retain the entire −13CF3 group.

C-labeled TPs. Since the structure 13CF3-TFA completely retains −13CF3 group, we

MATERIALS AND METHODS

103

Chemicals.

104

All chemicals were used as received. Details on chemicals used are described in the Supporting

105

Information (SI). 13CF3-4-TFMP was synthesized in-house with 99% isotopic purity of the

108

fluolead/HF•pyridine37 to prepare

109

substitution with benzyl alcohol under basic conditions followed by Pd/C hydrogenolysis

Photolysis Experiments.

112

Aqueous stock solutions (5 mM) of 4-TFMP, 13CF3-4-TFMP, and fluoxetine were prepared in

113

ultrapure water for photolysis experiments. Prior to the experiment, the stock solutions were

114

diluted with 0.5 mM acidic, neutral, or alkaline phosphate buffer to achieve an initial

115

concentration of 50 μM in a 100 mL polypropylene (PP) volumetric flask. 13CF3-4-TFMP

116

experiments were performed in ultrapure water. The solutions were then transferred into 10 mL

117

quartz tubes. For each experiment, three quartz tubes were kept in the dark as a control, and the

118

other three were placed in the photoreactor. Photolysis experiments were carried out in a

119

Luzchem LZC photoreactor equipped with 14 lamps centered at 311 nm in the UV-B region

120

(Figure S5), distributed on the ceiling and two opposite inner sides of the photoreactor. The

121

quartz tubes were placed on a carousel and rotated at a low speed to ensure that each tube was

122

evenly exposed to the UV-B light. Samples were taken at set intervals for a suite of analysis.

different initial concentrations of 4-TFMP of 4 μM and 85 μM were carried out in ultrapure

125

water. To identify if hydroxyl radicals were formed during photolysis, duplicate photolysis

126

experiments were performed in ultrapure water in the presence of excessive (20 mM and 80

127

mM) methanol.38 To determine if singlet oxygen (1O2) was produced, duplicate photolysis

128

experiments were performed in the presence of excessive (20 mM) furfuryl alcohol (FFA)39 and

129

in 99% D2O.40,41

130

The para-nitroanisole (PNA) actinometer was used to evaluate the quantum yield,42

131

following a setup previously described.28,43,44 Briefly, PNA was dissolved in acetonitrile as a

132

stock solution, then further diluted in ultrapure water to an initial concentration of 10 μM with

133

0.2% acetonitrile as the co-solvent. Photolysis of PNA were performed in triplicate using the

134

same quartz tubes. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for PNA was determined, and the

135

revised quantum yield of 0.00029 was used to calculate the quantum yield of 4-TFMP (see eq

136

S1 for calculation details).45,46

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

181

pH Dependent Photochemical TFA Formation

182

All 4-TFMP and fluoxetine aqueous photochemistry experiments produced TFA as a product,

183

with pH influencing the yields and rates of TFA formation. Figure 1A shows the degradation

184

of 4-TFMP in different pH solutions, with higher pH levels resulting in faster degradation, both

185

in the presence and absence of UV-B light. This observation is consistent with Bhat et al.’s

186

report on the photolysis of 4-TFMP, despite the use of different light sources.27 In dark controls,

187

the pH-dependent degradation of 4-TFMP is attributed to hydrolysis, driven by the

188

deprotonation of the phenol-OH group. The pKa of the phenol-OH in 4-TFMP is 8.1,48 thus,

189

under acidic conditions (pH 4.3), the phenol-OH remains protonated, and is less reactive to

190

hydrolysis. Under neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7.4 to pH 10.5), 4-TFMP exists as either

191

partially (~17%) or fully (>99%) the phenolate, which facilitates the spontaneous degradation

192

and defluorination reaction likely via the E1cB mechanism.49 In both pH 7.4 and pH 10.5 dark

193

controls, 4-TFMP underwent defluorination, releasing three equivalents of F− and forming the

194

corresponding benzoic acid, 4-HBA (Figure S6 and Figure S7). For all photochemistry

195

experiments, the defluorination of 4-TFMP was greater than corresponding dark controls at the

196

same pH, confirming that defluorination also occurred due to photochemistry and not solely

197

hydrolysis (Figure S7). Due to the high electron density of the phenoxide anion (i.e. the

198

deprotonated 4-TFMP), which can delocalize onto the benzene ring, the UV-Vis absorption

199

spectrum of 4-TFMP exhibits a red shift, resulting in greater overlap with the lamps used in

200

these experiments (Figure S5), leading to an increased photolysis rate, a phenomenon that has

201

been discussed.25–27 The quantum yield of these direct photochemistry reactions were highest

202

for 4-TFMP at pH 4.3 and lowest at pH 10.5 (Table 1). Since the reaction rate constants and

203

quantum yields have inverse trends across the pH range, it seems that the increased absorption

204

due to the red shift of the phenolate drives the faster reactivity at higher pH.

205

Figure 1B shows TFA was formed during 4-TFMP photolysis at all three pH levels tested,

206

but the formation kinetics and yield were both impacted by pH. An early study also observed

207

TFA formation across pH levels from TFM, a lampricide structurally similar to 4-TFMP, as

208

both have phenolic-OH and a −CF3 group.26 However, a recent study on 4-TFMP photolysis

209

did not detect TFA under alkaline conditions (pH 10), likely due to the sensitivity limitations of

210

their quantitative 19F NMR method.27

221

predicted molar yield of 9.2% (Table 1). This observation emphasizes the need to quantify TFA

222

across multiple time points of the experiments, because the conclusion will be misleading if the

223

measurement of TFA was made early in the reactions. As shown in Figure 1B, TFA

224

concentrations from 4-TFMP photolysis were initially higher under alkaline conditions (pH

225

10.5) compared to the other pH levels during the first 40 minutes, but quickly plateaued at a

226

TFAss% of 1.3% after 40 minutes. These kinetics may be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis

227

reaction occurring under alkaline conditions, which competes with the pathway of TFA

228

formation and quickly degrades 4-TFMP by defluorination. The result that 4-TFMP photolysis

229

under acidic condition generated more TFA aligns with previous research on this compound

230

and the related TFM.26,27 The TFA generated was a terminal product and was stable when

231

irradiated with UV-B light (see Figure S9).

232

Fluoxetine remained stable in dark control groups buffered across acidic to alkaline pH

233

levels (Figure S10), which is consistent with previous research on the laboratory stability test

234

of fluoxetine.50 This stability may be attributed to the absence of the acidic hydrogen from the

235

phenol-OH group, which is present in 4-TFMP but not in fluoxetine’s structure. Figure 1C and

236

Figure S10 show the photolysis of fluoxetine at different pH levels, where 4-TFMP was an

237

intermediate that was generated and then degraded away, which has been previously

238

observed.27,29,30 Our UHPLC-HRMS results identified α-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]benzyl alcohol

239

as the TP of the other half of fluoxetine during cleavage of the alkyl aryl ether bond (Table S9).

240

Under alkaline conditions (pH 10.7), 4-TFMP concentration remained relatively low, likely due

241

to its rapid photolysis and hydrolysis after formation. Figure 1D shows the formation of TFA

242

during fluoxetine photolysis across various pH levels. The TFAss% from fluoxetine predicted

243

by the kinetic model was 8.0% and 3.8% under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively,

244

comparable to that of 4-TFMP under acidic and neutral conditions. Similar to 4-TFMP

245

photolysis, fluoxetine produced TFA the fastest under alkaline conditions but the most TFA

246

under acidic conditions. However, under alkaline conditions, TFAss% from fluoxetine

247

photolysis was 3.4% compared to only 1.3% from 4-TFMP photolysis (Table 1). Contrary to

248

previous studies that suggest 4-TFMP as the only relevant −CF3 species for TFA formation,27,29

249

our findings indicate that fluoxetine may generate TFA through an additional intermediate that

250

does not involve 4-TFMP. Future work should investigate the formation of TFA from fluoxetine

251

directly, or through a pathway involving an intermediate other than 4-TFMP.

Identification of Additional Transformation Products

261

The fluorine mass balance of 4-TFMP in dark control and photolysis experiments at different

262

pH were between 80%-120% based on targeted analysis of 4-TFMP, TFA and F− (Figure S7),

263

suggesting that the major fluorinated products had were quantified. Since TFA and F− are both

264

terminal products, any missing fluorine must be from intermediates that form and then react

265

away during the experiments, due to either photolysis or hydrolysis. These intermediates will

266

be discussed below based on 19F NMR and HRMS results and proposed mechanistic

267

intermediates. Targeted analysis of the defluorination product 4-HBA, which contains no

268

fluorine atoms, showed distinct differences between dark controls and photolysis experiments

269

(Figure S6). In the dark controls, 4-TFMP hydrolyzed to produce 4-HBA, with its

270

concentration gradually increasing. On the other hand, in the photolysis experiments, although

271

the defluorination rate was higher than in the corresponding dark controls, the concentrations

272

of 4-HBA were lower, which suggests other defluorination pathways may exist, or that 4-TFMP

273

underwent photochemical reactions itself. The time trend of 4-HBA concentrations in

274

photochemistry experiments suggests it formed and then reacted away. The fluorine mass

275

balance for fluoxetine photolysis was lower than that of 4-TFMP, especially at acidic pH based

276

on quantification of fluoxetine, 4-TFMP, TFA and F−, suggesting the existence of more

277

fluorinated intermediates (Figure S7).

278

Non-targeted screening of fluorinated TPs was conducted using 19F NMR. 19F NMR offers

279

significant advantages over other analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, in

280

characterizing the environmental fate of fluorochemicals because it is not depended on

281

physicochemical properties of the molecules, only that they contain F-atoms.28,51 The natural

282

fluorine nuclei is 100% abundant in 19F and is NMR-active, and fluorine’s wide spectral

283

window minimizes peak overlap between structurally similar fluorine atoms. Additionally, the

284

lack of naturally occurring organofluorine compounds enhances the confidence in identifying

285

peaks in the spectrum.52,53

296

fluorinated molecule during 4-TFMP photolysis. Bhat et al. observed a similar peak in the direct

297

photolysis of 4-TFMP in acetate buffer, with no structure assigned.27 As this resonance lies

298

within the −CF3 region and between the 4-TFMP-CF3 and TFA-CF3 resonances, it may

299

represent an intermediate leading to the formation of TFA from 4-TFMP. 19F NMR spectra from

300

fluoxetine photolysis experiments confirmed the formation and decay of 4-TFMP (-60.98 ppm).

301

However, the -64.50 ppm peak present in 4-TFMP photolysis was not observed in fluoxetine

302

photolysis. Instead, a new peak appeared at -60.91 ppm, which exhibited an increase, then

303

decrease trend characteristic of a reaction intermediate. This species may account for some of

304

the missing fluorine mass balance during fluoxetine photolysis. Overall, the fluorine mass

305

balance for the aqueous photochemistry of fluoxetine decreased, then increased over the course

306

of the reaction (Figure S7), complementary to the trend the peak at -60.91 ppm, suggesting it

307

acts as a reaction intermediate before conversion to TFA or F−. In a previous study on the

308

photolysis of fluoxetine at a lower concentration and in a different buffer, no new peaks were

309

observed to the left (i.e. downfield) of the intermediate 4-TFMP peak in 19F NMR spectra.27

310

However, in those experiments, NMR spectra were only obtained at the beginning and end of

311

the reaction, so the intermediates may have been missed. Norfluoxetine is a well-characterized

312

metabolite and photolysis product of fluoxetine;29,31,54,55 however, comparing with a

313

norfluoxetine standard, no evidence of its formation was supported in either 19F NMR

314

(norfluoxetine -61.31 ppm) or HRMS.

Mechanistic Insights into TFA Formation

319

The introduction of the 13C isotope did not affect the photolysis rate of 4-TFMP, nor steady state

320

yield of TFA (~9%) (Figure S11). A main advantage to having the 13CF3 label for TFA

321

specifically is that there is no concern about laboratory contamination (e.g. from plastic tubing56

322

or as a mobile phase additive). We can be certain the 13CF3-TFA observed is formed as a product

323

of 13CF3-4-TFMP and not a potential impurity by monitoring specifically for this isotopologue

324

using targeted triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (Table S5).

325

Figure 3 is drawn using 13CF3-4-TFMP and its TPs and shows the photolysis of 4-TFMP

326

was divided into three distinct pathways: A) defluorination; B) self-sensitized TFA formation;

327

C) photodimerization. These findings highlight the complexity of the 4-TFMP photolysis

328

reactions. Confirmed and proposed intermediates were drawn based on combining Orbitrap

329

HRMS full scan, tMS2, and DDA analysis. These TPs were identified with different levels of

330

confidence and are summarized in Table S8. Unlabeled and 13CF3-labeled substances were

331

compared in the same table, with MS2 spectra provided in Figure S12.

332

Pathway A, defluorination: Defluorination is initiated either spontaneously in the dark in

333

higher pH buffers via reaction at the phenolate or through HF elimination under UV-B

334

photolysis. The presumed intermediate is a difluoromethylene quinone, however, similar to

335

other researchers, we were unable to observe it using 19F NMR and HRMS, likely due to its

336

short lifetime in aqueous solution as a highly reactive conjugated electrophile.29 Subsequently,

337

this proposed electrophilic species undergoes nucleophilic addition with water to form a

338

−13CF2OH structure, which then eliminates HF. Previous studies on PFAS degradation have

339

noted that in aqueous solutions, this −13CF2OH group can easily eliminate HF, forming a acyl

341

characteristic acyl fluoride resonance was not observed by 19F NMR. A study on the photo-

344

TP-A-1 further reacts with water to produce the hydrolysis product TP-A-2 (13C-4-HBA),

345

which was a major product in the dark controls. Unexpectedly, TP-A-1 also reacts with 13CF3-

346

4-TFMP to form a 13C-labeled trifluoromethylated hydroxybenzoate, TP-A-3, in both dark

347

controls and UV-B photolysis. The rapid formation of TP-A-2 from 13CF3-4-TFMP, quickly

348

followed by its conversion to TP-A-3, may explain why the fluorine mass balance of 4-TFMP

349

at pH 10.5 deviated from 100% at the beginning of the reaction and remained relatively constant

350

thereafter (Figure S7). Under UV-B photolysis, the extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) from

351

the HRMS for the same m/z as TP-A-3 showed multiple chromatographically separated peaks

352

(Table S8), suggesting the formation of isomers during the photolysis. The further conversion

353

of TP-A-2 into other TPs upon UV-B is consistent with the quantitative analysis of 4-HBA.

354

Phenol (m/z of [M-H]− = 93.0346) was identified as an in-source fragment of 4-HBA rather

355

than a TP, and therefore, 4-HBA does not decarboxylate under UV-B irradiation.

365

in its MS2 spectrum that preserve the benzene ring (Figure S12C). 13CF3-4-TFMP+O was

366

observed as two chromatographically separated EIC peaks, suggesting the ∙OH radicals oxidize

367

non-selectively at both the ortho and meta positions relative to the −13CF3 group. Interestingly,

368

∙OH radicals were also captured by 13C-4-HBA, the hydrolysis defluorination product. 13C-4-

369

HBA is a ∙OH radical probe, and previous studies have shown that its reaction with ∙OH

370

produces a single product, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, which was detected by HRMS as TP-A-

371

4.58,59 TP-B-1 can be further oxidized to TP-B-2 and subsequently to TP-B-3. Both TP-B-2 and

372

TP-B-3 had much earlier retention times compared to 13CF3-4-TFMP and the 13CF3-4-TFMP+O

373

(TP-B-1) (Table S8), which suggests that they are ring-opening products of oxidative cleavage.

374

MS2 spectra support this (Figure S12D), with TP-B-2 showing fragments corresponding to

375

carboxyl group elimination (i.e. loss of CO2), while MS2 of TP-B-3 indicates the presence of

376

hydroxyl and aldehyde groups in the structure. In our experimental setup, no additional oxidants

377

(e.g. H2O2) were added, yet a series of oxidation reactions still occurred. This suggests in situ

378

photogeneration of ROS via self-sensitized photolysis, a process also observed in the photolysis

379

of tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, and 6PPD.60–62 To test the hypothesis that 4-TFMP undergoes

380

self-sensitized photolysis, photochemical experiments were performed in ultrapure water at

381

three concentrations of 4-TFMP (4, 50, 85 μM). Figure S13 shows the pseudo-first-order

382

kinetics fitting for the 4-TFMP photolysis in ultrapure water with different initial concentrations,

383

highlighting those higher initial concentrations inhibited photolysis, while lower concentrations

384

enhanced it, indicating that the 4-TFMP photolysis involves self-sensitization mechanism.60 As

385

shown in Figure 4A, the photolysis rate of 4-TFMP was decreased when the well-known ∙OH

386

scavenger methanol (20 mM) was present in the solution, with more reaction suppression at a

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-9ql22 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

387

higher concentration of methanol (80 mM). However, even with methanol in great excess (at

388

20 mM, MeOH:4-TFMP = 400:1), its inhibitory effect on 4-TFMP photolysis was limited.

389

When the methanol concentration was increased to 80 mM (MeOH:4-TFMP = 1600:1), the

390

photodegradation was further suppressed, but the extent of further inhibition was relatively low.

391

Interestingly, the addition of excess FFA (20 mM), a scavenger for 1O2, inhibited the photolysis

392

of 4-TFMP more effectively than 80 mM methanol (Figure 4B). Although FFA also quenches

393

∙OH radicals,38,63 the large decrease in photodegradation rate when excessive FFA was present

394

suggests that 1O2 may play a more prominent role among the generated ROS. 1O2 has ~20 times

395

longer lifetime in D2O than in H2O,40,41 as a 1O2 enhancer, photodegradation of 4-TFMP was

396

accelerated in 99% D2O as expected (Figure 4B), further demonstrating 1O2 is a key ROS

397

generated during 4-TFMP photolysis.

398

Based on all evidence presented, we propose that under UV-B irradiation, 4-TFMP

399

undergoes self-sensitized photolysis, wherein 4-TFMP is oxidized, and molecular oxygen

400

either reacts with triplet-state [4-TFMP]* to form 1O2 or is reduced to superoxide. Superoxide

401

is then converted into H2O2, which decomposes to ∙OH. ∙OH, a strong oxidant which can attack

402

multiple reactive sites on organic compounds, leading to hydroxylated TPs (i.e. TP-B-1),64

403

while 1O2 is a weaker oxidant which can react with phenols to form hydroperoxides,65 leading

404

to ring-opening TPs after hydrolysis (i.e. TP-B-2). As shown in Figure S14, 1O2 can add to the

405

phenol ring through two pathways, forming cyclic peroxides that convert into hydroperoxides.

406

Since the ring-opening product 4-TFMP+2O, formed from the 1,4-addition, does not have

407

characteristic carboxyl group loss in MS2, it is likely that the 1,2-addition pathway is favored.

408

TP-B-2 may also form through the reaction of the 4-TFMP radical cation with superoxide, as

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-9ql22 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

409

proposed in a similar mechanism by Deng et al. in lignin photolysis.66 Multiple pathways

410

contribute to the formation of TP-B-2, in which the aromatic ring no longer exists, while the –

411

CF3 group remains, likely corresponding to the -64.50 ppm resonance in the 19F NMR spectrum.

412

TP-B-2 can undergo further oxidation by various ROS to form TP-B-3, which can then

413

experience deeper oxidative cleavage, eventually yielding TFA. Notably, in a study on bacterial

414

degradation of fluoxetine that produces TFA, the intermediates 4-TFMP+3O were also

415

detected.67 Its structure resembles the oxidative ring-opening product 4-TFMP+3O found in

416

photolysis, suggesting similarities in mechanisms between the photolysis of 4-TFMP and its

417

bacterial biotransformation. The oxidative cleavage process of 4-TFMP is analogous to a

418

bleaching process of brown carbon in atmospheric chemistry, where UV-Vis absorbing aromatic

419

compounds are step wised oxidized, resulting in aromatic ring cleavage, the loss of conjugated

420

structures, and a reduction in light absorption.68–70

421

Pathway C, photodimerization: Unexpectedly, 13CF3-4-TFMP underwent dimerization

422

during photolysis. While the exact substitution position of the phenoxide could not be

423

determined, the MS2 spectrum of the dimer product TP-C-1 clearly indicates that one phenoxide

424

added to the benzene ring of another 13CF3-4-TFMP molecule (Figure S12F). Previous studies

425

on phenol oxidation have shown that phenol can polymerize via phenoxide radicals.71,72 We

426

hypothesize that the photodimerization of 13CF3-4-TFMP follows a similar mechanism, with

427

self-sensitization still contributing to the process, as the photodimerization of two 13CF3-4-

428

TFMP molecules results in the net formation of one H2O2. The dimer product, TP-C-1, contains

429

two –13CF3 groups and further photo-defluorinated through intermediates TP-C-2 and TP-C-3,

430

ultimately forming a 13C2-labeled dimer of 4-HBA (TP-C-4).

Environmental Implications

440

Here, we report the kinetics and yields of TFA from aqueous photochemical reactions of 4-

441

TFMP at different pH, and compare to the yields of TFA from fluoxetine. Currently, TFA is

442

being reviewed as one of the smallest PFAS across many jurisdictions.73,74 In order to

443

understand the global burden of TFA, production of TFA from aryl-CF3 compounds must be

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-9ql22 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

444

better characterized. Under our experimental conditions, the yield of TFA from 4-TFMP

445

photolysis ranged from 1.3 to 9.2% depending on the pH of the solution. Fluoxetine had a

446

higher yield than 4-TFMP at alkaline pH, which suggests it may have an additional formation

447

mechanism of TFA – this should be investigated further.

448

Here, we reported the first mechanistic insight including tracking the formation of TFA

449

from 4-TFMP via a series of oxidative additions prior to oxidative cleavage of the aromatic

450

ring. The use of an isotopically-labeled test compound increased confidence of intermediates

451

and TFA formation, which was particularly useful as TFA has notoriously challenging

452

laboratory contamination. There is no doubt that the TFA formed in these experiments

453

originated from 4-TFMP – it did not arise from contamination nor from reactions of an impurity

454

in the experiment.

455

Ideally, reactions of contaminants in the environment will result in complete

456

mineralization, but for 4-TFMP and fluoxetine, they form TFA which persists in the

457

environment and will continue to accumulate if usage continues.75 If certain aryl-CF3 can be

458

designed to undergo defluorination pathways only and not form TFA, we may be able to harness

459

the power of the −CF3 moiety without producing very persistent TFA.

460

These experiments were performed using lamps centered at UV-B and buffers prepared in

461

the lab. Based on the three proposed pathways, only one forms TFA. It is possible that other

462

oxidative reactions, including indirect photochemistry (which has been observed to form TFA

463

for 4-TFMP27) or microbial reactions,67 may increase the yield of TFA compared to what we

464

observed here, thereby increasing the overall contributions of TFA to the environment from 4-

465

TFMP and related compounds. Future studies should investigate the TFA yield from a range of

466

aryl-CF3 under a range of realistic environmental conditions, including from agrochemicals,

467

since the concentration of TFA in surface waters has been correlated to land use.76
