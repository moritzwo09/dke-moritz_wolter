Abstract

23

Nitrogen in wastewater can be recovered to prevent negative environmental, human health, and

24

economic impacts and to enable distributed chemical manufacturing. We developed novel flexible

25

electrochemical stripping (FECS) for tunable recovery of ammonia/ammonium (total ammonia

26

nitrogen, TAN) from urine as (NH4)2SO4 and aqueous NH3. Batch and continuous experiments

27

demonstrated that product speciation could be readily controlled by modifying electrochemical

28

cell operation frequency, duration, and applied current without affecting TAN removal. During

29

continuous experiments, FECS recovered NH3 solutions with concentrations similar to ready-to-

30

use cleaners (1% and 2% NH3 (w/w) or 8.22 and 16.4 g/L TAN) and cleaner concentrates (5%

31

NH3 (w/w) or 41.1 g/L TAN), as well as (NH4)2SO4 solutions between 5 and 18.4 g/L TAN,

32

approaching commercial fertilizer concentrations (28.4 g/L TAN). Beyond modifying applied

33

current, future process engineering and operating condition optimization should reduce energy

34

consumption, increase recovery efficiency, and enhance economic viability of FECS. Our findings

35

will enable development and deployment of electrochemical nitrogen recovery in contexts with

36

varying needs for ammonia-based products, paving the way for circular economies that integrate

37

distributed chemical manufacturing with sanitation systems.

1 Introduction

48

Innovation in wastewater treatment and resource recovery can yield urgently needed solutions that

49

manage humanity’s transgression of multiple planetary boundaries (e.g., climate change,

50

nitrogen/phosphorus biochemical flows).1,2 Traditional wastewater nitrogen removal approaches

51

are energy- and chemical-intensive. Transitioning to wastewater nitrogen recovery can prevent the

52

negative environmental, human health, and economic impacts of nitrogen discharges,3–5 while

53

reducing greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment6 and Haber-Bosch ammonia

54

production7 and rebalancing the nitrogen cycle. At the same time, expanding sanitation access

55

requires radical innovations in wastewater management, such as distributed treatment with

56

resource recovery.8–10 Rapid and transformative innovation enabling resource-efficient wastewater

57

management and circular economies is crucial to preventing irreversible, catastrophic changes

58

around the globe.11–13

59

Expanding product portfolios and increasing process tunability can accelerate scale-up and

60

deployment of circular wastewater technologies. Most nitrogen recovery processes generate

61

fertilizer products.14 Two main challenges associated with recovered fertilizers are their low

62

economic value and the breadth of formulations required to meet variable, regional, and crop-

63

specific needs.9,15–17 Co-generating multiple products can improve the economic viability of

64

recovery technologies.18–20 Some nitrogen recovery processes co-generate fertilizers and non2

65

nutrient products, such as fuel (e.g., H2,21–24 CH4 25,26), electricity,21,25,27,28 caustic solutions,25

66

acids,23 H2O2,18,25 organics,25,26 and clean water.29,30 Multi-process systems have also been

67

demonstrated to generate multiple separate fertilizer products (e.g., struvite, (NH4)2SO4, potash).31

68

However, recovering non-fertilizer nitrogen products (e.g., microbial protein for use as animal

69

feed22) and controlling generation of multiple nitrogen products in a single reactor remain under-

70

explored. These advances could facilitate tailoring fertilizer formulations to soil or crop

71

characteristics,32 create more opportunities for nitrogen recovery (e.g., when fertilizer demand is

72

low), and enable recovery of higher-value products. For example, a process that can switch

73

between generating (NH4)2SO4 and NH3 could have advantages for economic viability and

74

equitable resource access. While (NH4)2SO4 is primarily used as a fertilizer,33 NH3 is not only a

75

fertilizer34 but also a disinfectant,35–38 precursor in chemical synthesis (e.g., plastics),34 and

76

fuel.39,40 While the price of NH3 is similar to or lower than that of (NH4)2SO4, products made from

77

NH3 (e.g., acrylonitrile, hexamethylenediamine, caprolactam) are significantly higher-value

78

(Figure S1-1, Table S1-1). Real-time tunability of product identity and composition can enable

79

distributed applications by responding to changes in product users’ needs.20,41 Electrochemical

80

processes, which are modular and easily scalable, automatable, low in chemical inputs, and well-

81

suited for decentralized wastewater treatment and chemical production,16,42–44 can facilitate tunable

82

multi-product recovery that meets specific chemical, public health, and environmental needs.16

83

In this study, we demonstrated tunable recovery of wastewater total ammonia nitrogen (TAN, sum

84

of NH3 and NH4+) as two products – (NH4)2SO4 and aqueous ammonia (NH3(aq)) – in a single

85

flexible electrochemical stripping (FECS) reactor. FECS builds on previously reported

86

electrochemical stripping (ECS, which recovers (NH4)2SO4)45–47 to broaden the TAN product

87

portfolio without dramatically increasing reactor footprint. The specific objectives of this study

88

were to: (1) develop a novel reactor architecture for producing two separate ammonia-based

89

products in a single reactor; (2) investigate electrochemical operating parameters as a mechanism

90

for controlling product distribution; and (3) demonstrate continuous urine treatment for tunable

91

generation of multiple commercially relevant aqueous ammonia product solutions. In the four-

92

chambered FECS reactor consisting of two electrochemical cells, the operating frequency and

93

current density of the second electrochemical cell controlled product distribution between

94

(NH4)2SO4 and NH3(aq). Stable, continuous FECS operation treating urine for 16 days generated

95

1% and 2% (w/w) NH3 solutions (8.22 and 16.4 g/L TAN) as ready-to-use cleaners and almost 5%

96

(w/w) NH3 solution (41.1 g/L TAN) as a cleaner concentrate, in addition to up to 18.4 g/L TAN

97

(NH4)2SO4 fertilizer. Therefore, FECS achieved product diversification beyond fertilizer by

98

recovering two ammonia-based products and enabled tuning product speciation to meet context-

99

specific needs. With these advances, FECS can facilitate distributed sanitation and manufacturing

100

of NH3(aq) and chemicals derived from it, reducing the environmental impacts of both industries,

101

fostering more equitable access to resources,48,49 and promoting waste valorization as a strategy to

102

keep human development within planetary limits.50

108

and allowed to hydrolyze for at least 12 months. Hydrolyzed urine contained below 0.35 mM urea-

117

FECS experiments were performed in a four-chambered reactor (Figure 1, Figure S2-1, Table S2-

119

modes – concurrent (Figure 1A) and staggered (Figure 1B). Staggered experiments were

120

conducted at three currents: 0.64 A (i.e., current density of 100 A/m2), 2 A (i.e., 312.5 A/m2), and

121

4 A (i.e., 625 A/m2). Experimental details are described in Section S2.2 and analytical procedures

process based on removal and recovery efficiency and energy consumption for removal and

recovery (Table S2-4, Equations S5-10 to S5-23).

3 Results and Discussion

130
131

3.1 Controlling Product Speciation with Electrochemical Operation

132

batch experiments. Modifying operation of the second electrochemical cell enabled tuning product

133

speciation (Figure 2). TAN removal and total TAN recovery were similar for concurrent and

134

staggered operation at 0.64 A (100 A/m2) (Figure 2A, Table S3-1). The product distribution was

135

similar for both modes when the second electrochemical cell was on; (NH4)2SO4 in Chamber 3

136

dominated with 46.4  9.1% recovery efficiency for (NH4)2SO4 and 30.6  6.6% for NH3(aq) after

137

12 hours (2.15  0.33 g/L TAN as (NH4)2SO4 vs. 1.42  0.34 g/L TAN as NH3(aq)). Longer

138

operation up to 24 hours did not shift product speciation toward NH3(aq) (Figure S3-1, Figure S3-

139

2). While concurrent operation recovered a combination of (NH4)2SO4 and NH3(aq) at all times,

140

staggered operation at 0.64 A recovered only (NH4)2SO4 when the second electrochemical cell

141

was off (first 6 hours, 75.4  7.0% recovery efficiency for (NH4)2SO4 vs. 0.68  0.3% for NH3(aq)).

142

Because staggered operation at 0.64 A facilitated control over the start of NH3(aq) recovery (i.e., by

143

turning on the second electrochemical cell) but still primarily recovered (NH4)2SO4, further

A continuous FECS experiment treating urine (Table S2-3) in staggered mode was conducted for

FECS recovered both NH3(aq) and (NH4)2SO4 from urine containing 4.29  0.19 g/L TAN during

144

modified staggered operation of the second electrochemical cell was needed to target more tunable

145

TAN recovery.

146

Changing the current applied to the second electrochemical cell influenced product distribution

147

(Figure 2B). Across three applied currents (0.64 A or 100 A/m2, 2 A or 312.5 A/m2, and 4 A or

148

625 A/m2), we observed consistent removal efficiency (Table S3-2), indicating that operation of

149

the second electrochemical cell did not affect the removal process occurring in the first

150

electrochemical cell. Total recovery efficiency was also similar across the three staggered

151

conditions (Table S3-2) except when TAN mass balance closure differed (Figure S3-3). (NH4)2SO4

152

was the dominant product after 6 hours in all cases, but after 12 hours, the ratio of NH3(aq) to

153

(NH4)2SO4 varied directly with applied current. In fact, NH3(aq) was the dominant product within

154

2 hours of turning on the second electrochemical cell (8 hours of total operation) at 2 A and 4 A.

155

After 12 hours, recovery efficiencies were 57.1  7.6% as NH3(aq) versus 17.5  3.1% as (NH4)2SO4

156

at 2 A and 65.9  1.9% as NH3(aq) versus 14.2  1.9% as (NH4)2SO4 at 4 A. Therefore, increasing

157

current applied to the second electrochemical cell relative to the first cell prioritized NH3(aq) over

158

(NH4)2SO4 production, enabling applications of recovered TAN beyond fertilizer.

174

only TAN present in the reactor chambers and recirculation bottles; Figure S3-4 shows analogous metrics accounting for TAN

175

captured in acid traps as well as TAN present in the reactor chambers and recirculation bottles.

176

When treating hydrolyzed urine, FECS generated: (1) NH3(aq) in Chamber 4 with concentrations

177

similar to ready-to-use cleaners (1% and 2% NH3 (w/w)) and cleaner concentrates (5% NH3 (w/w))

178

and (2) (NH4)2SO4 solutions in Chamber 3 with no less than 5 g/L TAN and up to 18.4 g/L TAN,

179

approaching commercial fertilizer concentrations (28.4 g/L TAN)51 (Figure 3). In this study, we

180

prioritized TAN up-concentration into NH3 solutions over (NH4)2SO4 to advance tunable FECS

181

product distribution compared to previous ECS studies focused on (NH4)2SO4 recovery.47

182

Continuous FECS removed 88.1  0.72% of TAN from urine with an influent concentration of

183

4,950  290 mg/L TAN (effluent composition shown in Table S3-3). Although continuous FECS

184

achieved removal similar to ECS (83.4 ± 1.5%),47 the steady-state recovery efficiency (30.7 

185

2.8% at 5 days onward) was lower than for ECS (73.0 ± 2.9%)47 and lower than removal in FECS.

186

Fluctuating pH in Chamber 3 decreased recovery efficiency in FECS compared to ECS by causing

187

an inconsistent NH3 concentration gradient driving diffusion from Chamber 2 to 3 and thus, TAN

188

accumulation in Chamber 2 (Figure S3-4, Figure S3-5Error! Reference source not found.).

189

Given alkaline conditions in Chambers 3 and 4 (Figure S3-4; intermittently alkaline in Chamber

190

3, always alkaline in Chamber 4), better sealing these chambers would reduce NH3 transfer to acid

191

traps and improve recovery efficiency (46.5 ± 3.3%, Figure S3-6). Additional factors contributing

192

to low FECS recovery included (Figure S3-7 through Figure S3-9, Section S3.2.1): TAN transfer

193

to the Chamber 2 acid trap; TAN oxidation to NO2-, NO3-, and possibly un-measured gaseous

194

species (e.g., N2); potential losses due to NH3 volatilization; and possible interference of mesh

195

supports around the omniphobic membrane with TAN mass transfer to and through the membrane.

196

While FECS achieved steady TAN removal and recovery, future improvements are needed to

10

197

increase TAN recovery as (NH4)2SO4 and NH3(aq) (e.g., preventing TAN oxidation) or enable

198

recovery of additional products (e.g., gaseous NH3, NO3-).

199

Despite low recovery efficiency, TAN concentrations in Chambers 3 and 4 generally increased

200

over time, and TAN concentrations and product distribution between Chambers 3 and 4 showed

201

short-term fluctuations that reflected operation of the second electrochemical cell (Figure 3). When

202

the second electrochemical cell was on, the TAN concentration in Chamber 3 decreased and the

203

TAN concentration in Chamber 4 increased due to electromigration of NH4+ from Chamber 3 to

204

4. When the second electrochemical cell was off, the TAN concentration in Chamber 4 decreased

205

and the TAN concentration in Chamber 3 increased due to NH3 back-diffusion from Chamber 4 to

206

3. Chamber 4 TAN concentration seemed to plateau (i.e., fluctuated between 23.7 and 31.2 g/L

207

each day) starting at about 8 days. On Days 11 and 13, we achieved higher Chamber 4

208

concentrations (up to 40.3 g/L TAN, 4.89% NH3 (w/w)) and greater product distribution toward

209

NH3(aq) over (NH4)2SO4 by increasing the operation frequency of the second electrochemical cell

210

(i.e., 1-hour on vs. 1-hour off periods instead of 1-hour on vs. 6- to 12-hour off periods) to limit

211

back-diffusion (Figure S3-10). Reactor modifications (e.g., using a thicker CEM in the second

212

electrochemical cell,52 alternative architectures like electrocatalyst-in-a-box (ECaB)53) in

213

combination with the demonstrated operational strategy could further enhance NH3(aq) recovery.

214

Long-term FECS operation revealed water transfer from Chamber 3 to 4 (due to osmosis and

215

electro-osmosis) as a second challenge to NH3(aq) up-concentration (Figure S3-11, Figure S3-12).

216

While water transfer did not drastically affect the time needed to reach ready-to-use cleaner

217

concentrations (1% and 2% (w/w) NH3), reaching 5% (w/w) NH3 could have been achieved in 9.4

218

rather than 13.2 days without water transfer (Figure S3-13). This detrimental effect of water

219

transfer was most noticeable at the highest target concentration because greater concentration
11

220

differences across the second CEM resulted in more osmotic water transport.54,55 Mitigating water

221

transfer likely requires material innovations, like tuning membrane properties (e.g., polymer and

222

fixed charge group identity, pore size and connectivity, coating).56–58 Therefore, integrated

223

optimization of reactor architecture, materials, and operation is needed to achieve more complete

224

TAN recovery and higher NH3(aq) concentrations in FECS.

225

The tunability that FECS offers had significant energy and monetary costs (Figure S3-14). TAN

226

removal via FECS required about 166  8.2 MJ/kg N compared to 61.2  4.2 MJ/kg N for ECS.47

227

Energy consumption for recovery was 470  56 MJ/kg N compared to 69.6  3.2 MJ/kg N

228

recovered for ECS,47 32 MJ/kg N for conventional ammonia stripping,59 31.6 MJ/kg N for the

229

Haber-Bosch process,60 and 77.9 MJ/kg N for conventional nitrogen management via the Haber-

230

Bosch process and nitrification-denitrification (Figure S3-15, Table S3-4).46,60 Despite the high

231

energy demand of FECS, in situ acid and base generation minimized chemical inputs, which can

232

contribute significantly to life-cycle costs and environmental impacts for nitrogen recovery

233

technologies.61 Each electrochemical cell contributed almost equally to total energy consumption

234

(Figure S3-16). Modifying the applied current for the second electrochemical cell could reduce

235

energy demand (Figure S3-17, Figure S3-18, Table S3-5, Table S3-6, Section S3.2.2). Altering the

236

operation frequency of the second electrochemical cell and reactor architecture could improve

237

energy efficiency by maintaining more consistent migration from Chamber 2 to 3 and reducing

238

NH3 back-diffusion from Chamber 4 to 3. Additional energy consumption and reactor components

239

(e.g., two anodes in FECS vs. one in ECS47) entail significant costs for the additional functionality

240

that FECS enables, motivating future studies on low-cost, durable materials; alternative reactor

241

configurations that reduce TAN losses and increase recovery efficiency; and further tuning

242

operating parameters to reduce energy consumption, improve recovery, and enhance product

243

control.

244

4 Implications

245

We demonstrated a novel reactor, FECS, that facilitates tunable recovery of ammonia/ammonium

246

from urine as both (NH4)2SO4 and NH3(aq). While (NH4)2SO4 is mainly used as a fertilizer, NH3 is

247

more versatile, with uses as a disinfecting cleaner,35–38 green fuel,39,40 and industrial feedstock for

248

plastic, rubber, and fiber synthesis.34 With minimal chemical inputs and real-time control over

249

product distribution, FECS can integrate distributed wastewater treatment and chemical

250

manufacturing in diverse settings with changing local needs and markets. Simpler, lower-cost, and

251

lower-energy systems like ECS may be more suitable in cases where TAN removal is the primary

252

goal (e.g., due to regulatory limits on environmental discharges). However, FECS is valuable if

253

NH3(aq) or switching between (NH4)2SO4 and NH3(aq) is desirable. For instance, FECS could supply

254

NH3 to nearby industries reducing dependence on long-distance supply chains and provide both

255

fertilizers and cleaners to remote rural agricultural communities. Therefore, integrating FECS into

256

sanitation systems can promote more equitable resource access, improve food security and health,

257

and lower environmental impacts of chemical industries while contributing to re-engineering the

258

nitrogen cycle toward circularity.
