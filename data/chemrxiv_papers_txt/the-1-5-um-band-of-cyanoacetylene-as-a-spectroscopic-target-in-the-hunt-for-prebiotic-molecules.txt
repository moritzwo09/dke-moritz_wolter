ABSTRACT
The search for prebiotic molecules officially entered a new era with the launch of the James Webb
Space Telescope. The capabilities of the near-infrared instrumentation on board offer greater sensitivity
and resolution than has ever been available in a space-based instrument. With the planned launch of
more near-infrared telescopes—such as SPHEREx in 2025—it is essential to have laboratory data for
important molecules on hand to guide observations in this spectral region. We present here the first
published line list of the prebiotic cyanoacetylene (HC3 N) molecule in the 1.5µm region. Molecules were
cooled to 20 K through the use of a cryogenic buffer-gas cooling yielding well-resolved ro-vibrational
states of the 2ν1 band that were probed and assigned using cavity-ringdown spectroscopy. Rotational
constants were calculated using PGOPHER and spectral line intensities were measured relative to
hydrogen cyanide. We recommend the HC3 N 1.5 µm band as an observational target for transmission
spectroscopy at Hycean and Super-Earth exoplanetary bodies.

1. INTRODUCTION

The discovery that cyanoacetylene (HC3 N) is formed
as a major nitrogen-containing product when mixtures
of methane and nitrogen are subjected to an electrical
discharge (Sanchez et al. 1966)—among other plausible
geochemical synthesis routes (Patel et al. 2015; Rimmer & Shorttle 2019)—has long motivated the study of
this linear cyanopolyyne as a potential prebiotic feedstock molecule. Indeed, cyanoacetylene is now considered to be the first ingredient in the synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in the “RNA world”
hypothesis (Ferris et al. 1970; Powner et al. 2009; Patel
et al. 2015; Becker et al. 2019). As such, the ongoing study of cyanoacetylene will play an important role
in extraterrestrial exploration and the search for life in
space.
Given its presumed importance in prebiotic chemistry, it is no surprise that cyanoacetylene has been an
observational target for diverse astronomical environCorresponding author: Leah G. Dodson

ments. In addition to its relevance to prebiotic chemistry, the observation of cyanoacetylene at astrophysical
objects contributes to an understanding of their conditions (thermodynamics, isotopic abundances, solid-/gasphase chemistry, etc.). For example, the observation of
gaseous cyanoacetylene in the coma of Hale-Bopp led to
questions about whether this chemical species originates
in the solid comet nucleus or was formed in gas-phase reactions in the coma (Cordiner & Charnley 2021). Similar puzzles exist on Titan, with its nitrogen/methane atmosphere, where the observation of cyanoacetylene isotopologues revealed the role that photochemistry plays
in nitrogen isotope abundance ratios (Cordiner et al.
2018). Interstellar detections of cyanoacetylene began in
1971 with its observation toward Sagittarius B2 (Turner
1971; McGee et al. 1973), where it was already noted to
likely not be thermalized with the local environment.
Given its low-frequency bending modes, many studies have since found evidence for vibrationally excited
cyanoacetylene toward other sources, including a recent
extensive survey of hot cores (Chen et al. 2025).
Astrophysical observations of cyanoacetylene have
been enabled by numerous laboratory spectroscopy

studies—thoroughly documented in HITRAN (Gordon
et al. 2022) and the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (Müller et al. 2001)—most of which
have been conducted at room temperature (Tyler &
Sheridan 1963; Arie et al. 1990; Thorwirth et al. 2001;
Jolly et al. 2007; Douin et al. 2015; Bizzocchi et al.
2017; Ugelow & Anderson 2022), with non-equilibrium
conditions sometimes achieved by means of electrical
discharge for assignment of vibrational excited states
(Sanz et al. 2005). With the spectroscopic capabilities
now available through the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST), and in the near future SPHEREx, attention
has turned toward detection of biosignatures (including cyanoacetylene) in exoplanetary atmospheres across
regions of the mid- and near-infrared, increasing the demand for extended spectroscopic line lists. Rimmer et
al. constructed an extensive cyanoacetylene line list to
demonstrate the potential use of JWST for detection
of this species in the atmosphere around the exoplanet
1132b (Rimmer et al. 2021). While it was not considered in their model, the first overtone of the C – H
stretching vibration (2ν1 ) lies near 1.5 µm, making it
a potential target for transmission spectroscopy in the
near-infrared. The goal of the present work is to provide
laboratory spectroscopy data for cyanoacetylene in the
near-infrared region—where data is sparse—that could
be used in future JWST observations.
Cyanoacetylene spectroscopy is complicated by the
low-lying bending mode (ν7 ) and several combination
bands that all lie below 450 cm−1 (Tamassia et al. 2022).
Their thermal population at room temperature adds
complexity to the spectra as we move into the nearinfrared—a problem that is mitigated in the laboratory
by measuring spectra at low temperature. Beyond the
goal of simplifying the spectroscopy, we aim to produce
thermalized, low-temperature cyanoacetylene for future
measurements of collisional cross sections and kinetics and therefore have implemented buffer-gas (sympathetic/collisional) cooling into our spectroscopy instrument.
In this Letter, we report the low-temperature spectrum of the 2ν1 mode of cyanoacetylene near 1.5 µm.
We show first that gaseous HC3 N can be cooled to 20
K in a buffer-gas cell, with rotational temperatures in
equilibrium with the cell walls. We then use the wellresolved low-temperature spectrum to report refined
values for the 2ν1 line positions and excited-state B̃ and
D̃ rotational constants. The astrophysical implications
of these measurements are discussed with regard to future observations of exoplanetary atmospheres, and we
propose this band as a potential tool for quantitative

cyanoacetylene detection in exoplanetary atmospheres.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The instrument used here is described in detail in a
previous work (Howard et al. 2024), and will only be
described briefly, with particular attention paid to the
modifications made to the instrument for the present
work. Central to the instrument is a cryogenic buffergas cell that is thermally anchored to the second stage of
a closed-cycle helium cryostat (Janis RDK-415D2). The
buffer-gas cell has two holes, 0.156” in diameter, that
create a spectroscopic axis and allow a laser to probe
species of interest within the cell. Gas is injected into
the cell using a 1/8” O.D. capillary tube that passes
through the cell entrance. Newly integrated into the instrument is an insulated temperature-controlled heating
sheath that is used to maintain an elevated temperature
on the capillary tube to ensure the species of interest
does not condense onto the inner tube walls before entering the buffer-gas cell. The copper heating sheath is
heated by a resistive heating element, with temperature
control achieved by monitoring its temperature with a
thermocouple and manually adjusting the supplied current. As before, mixtures of the species of interest are
prepared in pre-mixed cylinders with helium buffer gas
and the gas flow into the cell is controlled using a mass
flow controller (Alicat), with flow rates on the order of
1–10 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm). The
buffer-gas cell assembly is held within a 6-way Conflat
cross that is pumped using a Leybold 90iX turbomolecular pump. The ultimate chamber pressure is 10−7 Torr
(10−8 to 10−9 Torr with cryopumping) and is typically
on the order of 10−4 Torr when gas is flowing.
Molecules of interest inside of the buffer-gas cell are
probed using cavity-ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS).
The optical cavity is 45 cm in length and formed using two highly reflective mirrors (LayerTec, 1550 nm,
99.995% reflective) in custom optical mounts secured
directly to the six-way cross. The probe laser is a tunable external cavity diode laser (ECDL) with a linewidth
< 10 kHz (Toptica CTL-1550). Laser light is scanned
across the cavity and frequency measurements are made
by sending the zeroth order beam from an acousto-optic
modulator into a wavemeter (Bristol, 228B). The beam
is coupled into the cavity using a pair of mode-matching
lenses (f = 750, 250 mm) while one of the mirrors is
continuously dithered by a cylindrical piezoelectric actuator. Ringdown events are collected using an InGaAs
photodiode and recorded using custom software written
in LabVIEW. 100 ringdown events are collected per frequency step (0.0004 cm−1 ) and fit to an exponential de-

where c is the speed of light, τ0 ≈ 25 µs is the ringdown

buffer-gas cell.
Cyanoacetylene was prepared using a modified procedure of an existing method using propiolamide, phosphorous pentoxide, and sand (Ellis-Gibbings et al.
2022). All reagents were ground together using a mortar and pestle and transferred to an oven-dried reaction
flask. The reaction vessel was kept under active vacuum
and connected to a U-shaped trap that is immersed in
liquid nitrogen. The reaction mixture was heated up to
180◦ C in an oil bath over the course of 1 hour. After this,
the reaction flask was closed off from the trap, whereupon it was removed from the liquid nitrogen bath. The
collected product was allowed to sublime into a stainlesssteel gas cylinder before being diluted (∼ 2 − 4% of total
cylinder pressure) in ultra-high purity helium. Sample
purity was confirmed using standard FTIR spectroscopy.
Relative spectral line intensity measurements were
made for HC3 N using hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as the
reference compound, prepared as before (Howard et al.
2024). A mixed cylinder was prepared manometrically
that was 2.2% HCN and 2.6% HC3 N in helium for these
measurements.

3. RESULTS

Spectra of HC3 N were collected at 300 K and 20 K
to determine the ro-vibrational band center, assign J
states, and refine rotational constants. Large spectral
surveys were first obtained by scanning the probe laser
linearly from 6555 to 6548 cm−1 with a step size of
∼ 0.001 cm−1 . These larger survey scans were used to
identify approximate peak centers of the 2ν1 transition,
make initial J state assignments, and identify possible
hot bands. Figure 1 shows the resulting spectral surveys for both temperatures. Due to the long scan times
needed to collect the full spectrum (over 20 hours), instrument drift inevitably led to fluctuations in the peak
intensities, which should not be taken to be accurate in
the survey scans.
Guided by the survey scans, higher resolution scans
were then performed, scanning the laser with a step
size of 0.0004 cm−1 yielding more accurate peak centers
and intensities. This enabled accurate measurement of

the translational and rotational temperatures of the target species. Spectra for individual rotational transitions
were collected in a randomized sequence, with each transition measured a minimum of 3 times. The data were
baseline subtracted and fit in IgorPro, using a Gaussian function. Because the pressure within the buffergas cell is low, the spectra are Doppler-limited and the
full-width at half-maximum (FWHM, in cm−1 ) of the
Gaussian lineshape can be used to extract the translational temperature (Ttrans , in K) according to Eq. 2
(Bernath 1995).

only slightly higher than the expected temperature for
thermal equilibrium.
Rotational temperature (Trot , in K) was obtained using a Boltzmann plot, where the average of the fitted
area for each measured high-resolution ro-vibrational
peak was observed to vary as a function of the lower-

simulated in PGOPHER (Western 2017) using a previously published band center (Hall 1984) and groundstate rotational constants (Creswell et al. 1977). This
simulation was then refined using high-resolution data
obtained in this work, using PGOPHER the latter to assign J states to each transition. A comparison between
the lower-resolution survey spectrum and the simulated
PGOPHER spectrum is shown in Figure 3.

ducted to estimate the integrated spectral line intensity
of the 2ν1 band of HC3 N. HCN was used as the spectroscopic reference species, with quantitative temperaturedependent line intensities (Sij ) taken from the HITRAN
database (Gordon et al. 2022). The gas from a mixed,
dilute cylinder prepared with both HCN and HC3 N was
flowed into the buffer-gas cell held at 20 K to enable
a relative line intensity measurement. Flowing the two
gases simultaneously from the same source and measuring their spectra in the same experiment enabled the
cancellation of many instrument parameters, such as uncertainty in the absorber pathlength and fluid dynamics.
A single ro-vibrational line (P(1)) of HCN was measured
at 6516.65402 cm−1 and its peak area was obtained relative to that of a single HC3 N ro-vibrational line (R(5),
centered at 6554.075 cm−1 ). Figure 4 shows these two
peaks, along with the Gaussian fits used to obtain the
peak areas.

“area” is the area of the experimentally measured rovibrational peak for each molecule obtained by fitting
the peak with a Gaussian function. The integrated
area for the P(1) peak of HCN was 3.1 × 10−9 cm−2
and the integrated area for the R(5) peak of HC3 N
was 2.6 × 10−9 cm−2 , yielding a final line intensity of
Sij (HC3 N) = 1.2 × 10−20 cm−1 /( molecule · cm−2 ) for
this ro-vibrational transition at 20 K.

The measured R(5) line intensity for HC3 N was used
to calibrate the full spectrum simulated at 20 K in PGOPHER to obtain the line intensities for all other peaks
measured in this work (listed in Table 1). The line intensities for the scaled PGOPHER spectrum were summed
from 6544.0 cm−1 to 6559.5 cm−1 to obtain the total vibrational band strength for the 2ν1 transition of HC3 N,
yielding a value of 2.6 × 10−19 cm−1 /( molecule · cm−2 )
for the full vibrational band. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an estimated band
strength for HC3 N near 1.5 µm.
Despite the prominence of cyanoacetylene as an important prebiotic molecule, experimental data for HC3 N
is sparse and there exists no comprehensive line list
(Rimmer et al. 2021). While HC3 N has been investigated in the past, it has been almost exclusively at room
temperature in the mid-to-far infrared regions (Jolly
et al. 2007; Bizzocchi et al. 2017; Bénilan et al. 2006),
with no available data for the near infrared. With the
estimates obtained in this work, we fill this gap and further propose this spectral region as an observational target for HC3 N in exoplanetary atmospheres. By way of
comparison, the combination band of H2 S is a target for
detection in this spectral region by the Near Infrared
Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) system on
the JWST on several model exoplanetary bodies—
including Hycean and Super-Earths, where cyanoacetylene is expected (Claringbold et al. 2023). The vibrational band strength presented here for HC3 N at 1.5 µm
(∼ 10−19 cm−1 /( molecule · cm−2 )) is larger than that
of H2 S (∼ 10−20 cm−1 /( molecule · cm−2 )) near 1.6 µm

(Gordon et al. 2022). HC3 N can therefore be expected
to have even better detection thresholds to those of H2 S
of 10–100 ppm expected using the NIRISS.
5. CONCLUSIONS

Using collisional cooling within a buffer-gas cell coupled with cavity-ringdown spectroscopy, we have identified and assigned previously unpublished ro-vibrational
transitions for the 2ν1 transition of HC3 N in the 1.5 µm
region, refined the excited-state rotational B̃ and D̃
constants, and reported line intensity estimates that
motivate the use of this molecular signature in exoplanetary observations. Our technique translationally
and rotationally cools our target molecules—which was
confirmed using Doppler thermometry—enabling us to
extract important spectroscopic properties essential to
astrophysical detection. We estimate the total band
strength of the 2ν1 vibrational band of HC3 N to be
∼ 10−19 cm−1 /( molecule · cm−2 ), making it a viable
candidate for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy in
this spectral region. Future efforts include the measurement of collisional cross sections that, when coupled
with robust theoretical investigations, will yield information that is essential to a detailed understanding of
planetary and interstellar chemistry.
