Abstract

9

Continuous Monitoring (CM) solutions have been identified as a method to address methane

10

emissions at oil and gas (O&G) facilities, as these solutions can facilitate faster emission detection

11

and repair compared to traditional survey methods. This study tested 13 CM solutions over 12

12

weeks using single-blind controlled testing. Controlled release rates ranged from 0.08 to 6.75 kg

13

CH4 hr-1 and lasted 18 minutes to 8 hours. Six solutions demonstrated 90 % method detection

14

limits (DL90s) within the range of controlled releases, from 0.5 [0.3, 0.6] kg CH4 hr-1 to 6.7 [5.9,

15

8.0] kg CH4 hr-1. Of the six solutions, four had False Positive (FP) rates between 7.8% and 14.0%

16

(less than 15%), and four had False Negative rates (FN) of 8.0% to 34.1% (less than 50%).

17

Compared with Ilonze et al., these results show retested solutions balancing method sensitivity

18

with FP and FN rates. All scanning/imaging solutions had high localization (≥ 40%) precision and

19

accuracy to the equipment unit. Eleven of the 13 solutions were tested for quantification. Single

20

quantification estimates exhibited high relative quantification errors, outside the -90 % to 1000%

21

range. The mean quantification error ranged from 33 [0.9, 66] %, 95% CI to 1326 [1003, 1648] %,

22

95 % CI for small emissions, between 0.1 and 1 kg CH4 hr-1, and from 3 [-20, 26] %, 95% CI to

23

3578 [-2832, 9988] %, 95% CI for larger emissions, greater than 1 kg CH4 hr-1. There were 3 and

24

9 solutions in the small and large emissions categories, respectively, that had less than 100%

25

relative quantification error. Relative to previous studies, errors in quantification estimates

26

decreased, as did FN and FP rates, with improved DL90s for two of the four retested solutions.

27

These findings highlight that continuous, rigorous testing enhances solution performance, with

28

notable improvements observed across multiple testing programs using the same test protocol.

Introduction

33

Dry natural Gas (NG) production has gradually increased over the past ten years (EIA 2024). The

34

production increased by 4%, 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), in 2023 compared to the

35

production in 2022 (EIA 2024). Natural gas consists of between 70 % and 90 % methane (CH4),

36

one of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although CH4 stays in the atmosphere for a

37

shorter period than CO2, it has a global warming potential that is 27 - 30 times higher than CO2 in

38

a 100-year timespan (ORD US EPA 2017; OAR US EPA 2016; IPCC 2021). Methane is emitted

39

from natural sources, such as wetlands, and anthropogenic sources, such as energy production and

40

agricultural activities (NASA, 2024).

41

Globally, emissions from the energy sector accounted for approximately 130 million tonnes of CH4

42

in 2023 (IEA 2024). In the US, operations in the oil and gas (O & G) industry are the second-

43

largest industrial source of emissions (EPA, 2024a). Federal and state regulations require operators

44

to implement the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program (CDPHE; EPA, 2024). The program

45

aims to reduce intentional (vented) and unintentional (fugitive) methane emissions (Zimmerle,

46

Dileep, and Quinn 2024) from the O&G industry in the US and Canada.

47

Current regulatory-approved methods for LDAR programs, such as the EPA method 21 and OGI

48

camera surveys, can provide precise component- or equipment unit-level measurements

49

(EPA,2024b). However, they are expensive and labor-intensive when scaled over thousands of

50

O&G facilities. Also, studies have shown that source, facility-level, and annually assessed

51

emissions exhibit spatial and temporal variability (Brandt et al. 2014; Lavoie et al. 2017; Vaughn

52

et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2024). These variabilities make it challenging for surveys to estimate the

53

long-term size of emissions using snapshot measurements from a facility. Further, studies show

54

that super-emitters skew the emissions distribution (Collins et al. 2022; Huang et al. 2024; Schuit

55

et al. 2023; Zavala-Araiza et al. 2015). Super emitters emit at rates greater than 100 kg hr-1 (EPA,

56

2024b). Detecting such emitters using traditional methods is challenging because they are usually

57

intermittent.

58

Regulations (EPA, 2024b; CDPHE, 2024; European Parliament, 2024; EPA, 2023) and research

59

efforts have motivated the development and testing of new and existing Leak Detection and

60

Quantification (LDAQ) technologies (Bell et al., 2020, 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Ilonze et al., 2024;

61

Liu et al., 2024; MONITOR| Arpa-e, 2014; Ravikumar et al., 2019; Siebenaler et al., 2016;

62

Titchener et al., 2022). LDAQ technologies, such as Continuous Monitors (CM), promise to

63

address some emission measurement concerns by cost-effectively providing temporally resolved

64

monitoring of O&G facilities. These technologies are scanning, imaging, or point sensors installed

65

at O & G facilities to monitor NG or CH4 emissions for a long-term period. The major advantages

66

of CM solutions include the capability to detect large emissions, sustained operational capacity,

67

and provision of temporal data. Despite these advantages, CM solutions cannot be used for

68

regulatory LDAR programs unless they demonstrate equal or better emissions reduction than

69

existing LDAR survey methods (EPA, 2024c).

70

The EPA's final rule stipulates the performance CM solutions must meet to be approved as an

71

alternative approach for regulatory LDAR programs (EPA, 2024b). According to subpart OOOOb

72

40 CFR part 60 by the EPA, the detection threshold for CM systems must be at least 0.4 kg hr-1 of

73

CH4 over facility-specific background emissions (EPA, 2024b). Operators already use CM

74

solutions for internal emissions accounting and voluntary methane emissions reduction programs

75

like OGMP 2.0 (OGMP 2024). However, more rigorous testing is needed to improve confidence

76

in output data (such as the 90% method detection limit (DL90), quantification accuracy, detection,

77

and localization) and track solutions' performance trends over time.

78

Colorado State University’s (CSU) Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Centre

79

(METEC) developed a standardized, controlled testing protocol for the Advancing Development

80

of Emission Detection (ADED) project. The project was developed to assess the performance of

81

CM and survey solutions (Bell and Zimmerle 2022). Starting in 2022, the protocol has been

82

utilized for an extended CM test from February to April each year. The 2022 testing is documented

83

in Bell et al., 2023, the 2023 testing in Ilonze et al. (2024), and the 2024 testing in this paper.

84

The 2022 test showed that CM solutions exhibited quantification errors over ± 60% for single

85

emission estimates. One of the primary metrics assessed for all the CM solutions is the DL90,

86

which represents the emission rate at which a deployed solution detects emissions 90% of the time

87

(Bell et al. 2023). In 2023 testing, retested solutions showed decreased DL90 and FP rates (the

88

percentage of detection reports from a solution that incorrectly attributes a controlled release).

89

However, there were consistently wide quantification errors for single emission estimates. The

90

2023 testing also indicates that solutions with the lowest DL90 had the lowest FP and FN rates

91

(the percentage of controlled releases not identified by a solution). This contrasts with the

92

expectation that raising detection limits to lower FP and FN rates is necessary.

93

The current study (2024 testing) tested 13 CM solutions, including four solutions that

94

participated in the 2023 testing (Ilonze et al., 2024), and 2 of the four solutions and 1 of the thirteen

95

were also tested in 2022 (Bell et al. 2023). The solutions were tested at CSU’s METEC facility in

96

Colorado, US. Solutions were categorized into point sensor networks (PSNs) and

97

scanning/imaging solutions. The PSN solutions consist of point sensors deployed at/on the

98

facility’s equipment to detect the presence of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere (Day et al. 2024).

99

Scanning/imaging solutions deploy scanning lasers and short/mid-infrared cameras that generate

100

2D images of gas plumes at the deployed locations (Bell et al., 2023; Ilonze et al., 2024).

101

Algorithms are used with meteorological data to produce quantification and localization

102

information. Performance metrics such as the probability of detection (POD), quantification

103

accuracy, localization accuracy, and precision of a solution are presented in this study and

104

compared to the performance of solutions from 2023 (Ilonze et al., 2024) and 2022 (Bell et al.

105

2023).

Methodology

Testing Facility

108

The solutions were tested between February and April 2024 at CSU’s METEC facility. Long-

109

duration testing was conducted depending on the facility’s availability. Additionally, testing is

110

aimed at various conditions, as seen in winter and spring. The facility is an 8-acre (3 ha) outdoor

111

facility for testing and improving CH4 emissions LDAQ solutions. The facility consists of 7

112

wellpads, complete with retired O & G equipment, including, but not limited to, wellheads,

113

separators, and tanks (SI Figure S-1). For this study, wellpads 4 and 5 were used for controlled

114

releases of compressed natural gas. Wellpad 4 consists of 5 wellheads, four horizontal separators,

115

and three tanks, while Wellpad 5 consists of 3 wellheads and three vertical separators (SI Figure

117

identifiers) and flow meters that control the gas flow.

118

ADED Continuous Monitoring Protocol R1.0

119

Overview: The first revision of ADED’s controlled testing protocol (Bell & Zimmerle, 2022) was

120

developed in September 2020 by METEC. The protocol received contributions from stakeholders

121

in the O & G industry, LDAQ technology developers, regulatory bodies, non-governmental

122

agencies, and state and federal environmental agencies. The protocol employs single-blind,

123

controlled testing to evaluate the performance of solutions in a rigorous and reproducible manner.

124

This testing allows for inter-solution comparison and year-over-year performance evaluation. In a

125

single-blind test, the test center knows the emission rates and locations, while the performers

126

(solution providers) are unaware of this information. Testing is conducted for extended periods,

127

typically months, to assess the performance of a solution over a wide range of emission rates with

128

varied environmental and meteorological conditions.

129

According to the protocol, a solution consists of one or more natural gas (NG) or CH4 sensors,

130

data analytics, and a data management system. The analytics convert raw sensor readings to

131

quantification and localization data and infer the 1.) presence or absence of an emission, 2.) the

132

source emission rate, and 3.) location of an emission. The data management system reports

133

detections, localizations, and applicable quantification data.

134

Experimental Process

135

Compressed NG consisting of 84.2% CH4, 13.3% C2H6, 2.0% C3H8, and a trace amount of C4+

136

was released from storage gas cylinders. Emission points released gas at rates ranging from 0.08

137

to 6.75 kg CH4 hr-1. Flow meters assigned to each equipment group controlled gas flow through

138

the EPs on Pads 4 and 5. Testing involved a series of experiments with the number of EPs ranging

139

from 1 to 5 per experiment (SI Figure S9). The EPs were located on different equipment units for

140

experiments with multiple EPs. The duration of each experiment ranged from 18 minutes to 8

141

hours. The durations were selected to account for the duration of vented emissions and those that

142

may last for extended periods without being repaired.

143

Experiments ran 24 hours a day for 5 to 7 days per week. The controlled releases started and

144

ended simultaneously for experiments with multiple EPs. Multiple controlled releases are designed

145

to test the capability of a solution to attribute an emission to a particular location. Individual

146

experiments were separated from the preceding experiment by a no-emission period lasting from

147

30 min to 4 hours (SI Figure S-9). The no-emission period enabled solutions to potentially identify

148

the start and end of experiments when the concentration levels were reduced to the original

149

background concentration. Additionally, the no-emission periods were selected based on the time

150

it takes for the concentration in the atmosphere to return to the background; depending on

151

prevailing atmospheric conditions, this time varies.

152

The test facility assigned an experiment ID to an experiment and recorded the start and end time,

153

the duration, the metered flow rate, the uncertainty of the metered flow rate, the gas composition

154

(as measured using gas chromatography), and the meteorological conditions. Regularly, the team

155

processed the detection reports of various solutions to determine the emission rates and durations

156

that had not been covered while testing (small, large, and longer-duration releases).

157

Reporting: Performers submitted detection reports to METEC’s email reporting system for

158

evaluation using the protocol’s performance metrics (Bell & Zimmerle, 2022). Detection reports

159

notify the test center of identified individual emission events, the start time, the location, and the

160

emission rate of a source. Each report should be attributed to a single controlled release in an

161

experiment with multiple controlled releases for proper detection classification. Mandatory

162

information in the detection report includes the DetectionReportID, DetectionReportDateTime,

163

EmissionStartDateTime, EmissionSourceID, Gas (the species monitored by the solution), and

164

Equipment Unit (SI Section S5). The protocol allows performers to update a detection by sending

165

new reports referencing the same EmissionSourceID from a previous report. This provision enables

166

performers to change data, such as the estimated emission rate, the timing of a controlled release,

167

and the GPS coordinates, to reflect the best solution estimates. The update was permitted before

168

the test center sent the performance results to the performers.

169

In addition to the detection reports, performers submit offline reports whenever their solution is

170

not operating during testing. The offline reports state the offline start and end times, allowing the

171

exclusion of offline data during analysis. Additionally, the test center records all maintenance

172

events at the site, such as gas house filling and fixing faulty equipment. All the detection reports

173

sent during maintenance events are excluded from the analysis.

174

Before classification, specific data were removed from the analysis, including 1) data when the

175

performer reported their system was offline, 2) data that occurred outside the testing window, 3)

176

data that the performer stated the equipment unit as being off facility, i.e., outside the test facility’s

177

fence line, and 4) data that occurred during maintenance events as shown in the maintenance log

178

sheet. As stipulated in the protocol (Bell & Zimmerle, 2022), the classification process was as

179

follows:

180

1.) All the controlled releases conducted within the test facility were sorted by equipment

181

unit identifier and then by the flow rate, if reported by the performer, in descending order.

182

2.) From the first step above, the remaining controlled releases were sorted by equipment

183

group identifier and then by flow rate, if reported by a performer, in descending order.

8

184

3.) Finally, the remaining controlled releases were sorted by flow rate, if reported by a

185

performer, in descending order. After this step, all the controlled releases and unpaired

186

detections were classified as FN and FP detections, respectively.

187

In steps 1, 2, and 3 above, all the detections identifying the sorted equipment unit, group, or

188

facility as the emission source were selected, respectively. The selected detections whose emission

189

start time was between the controlled release start and end time were filtered and sorted by flow

190

rate, if reported by a performer, in descending order. Finally, the uppermost detection was paired

191

with a controlled release as a TP detection with correct unit, group, or facility-level localization

192

precision for steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After each step above, a matched pair was removed

193

from further classification.

194

Performance Metrics: Controlled releases within the testing period were paired with detection

195

reports to evaluate the performance of the solutions (SI Section S8). The detection reports were

196

classified as true positives (TP) or false positives (FP). According to the protocol, a TP occurs

197

when a performer’s detection report is attributed to the correct and coinciding controlled release.

198

A false positive occurs when a detection report incorrectly attributes a controlled release within

199

the test facility. During the second (Ilonze et al., 2024) and current protocol implementation, FPs

200

were further classified into FP-no controlled release and FP-excess. An FP-no controlled release

201

occurs when a detection report identifies an emission with no controlled release at the test facility.

202

An FP-Excess occurs when a detection report identifies a controlled release already paired with a

203

different detection report. A controlled release is classified as a false negative (FN) when there is

204

no detection report to pair with it.

205

The current study used the primary performance metrics, including the probability of detection

206

(POD), localization precision and accuracy, quantification accuracy, and detection time, to assess

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-f1znb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0003-0001-8649 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

9

207

a solution's performance. POD is a fraction of controlled releases under a set of independent

208

variables that were classified as detections. Independent variables include the controlled emission

209

rate and prevailing meteorological conditions. The localization accuracy at various levels

210

(equipment unit, equipment group, and facility levels) is the ratio of the TP detections to the sum

211

of the TP and FP reports. Localization precision of each TP detection was assigned to three levels

212

of precision (i.e., equipment unit, equipment group, and facility levels).

213

A precise equipment unit localization occurs when a performer correctly attributes a detection

214

to an equipment unit where the controlled release occurred. For instance, if a controlled release

215

occurred from the first wellhead unit on pad 4 (i.e., 4W-1), and the report identifies 4W-1, this TP

216

detection will have a localization precision to the unit level. However, if the controlled release

217

occurred on the third wellhead unit in pad 4 (4W-3), the TP detection will have a localization

218

precision to the equipment group. For the solutions that reported the source emission rate, the

219

quantification accuracy was assessed by computing the relative error between the controlled

220

release rate and the reported emission rate. Additionally, quantification accuracy was assessed by

221

analyzing the percentage of single estimates within a factor of 3. The detection time is the time

222

difference between the start of a controlled release and when a performer submitted the first

223

detection report.

ADED Participating Solutions: Spring 2024

225

Participants were recruited through an open invitation on the METEC facility’s website and by

226

contacting solution developers identified during protocol development. Ten performers deployed

227

their solutions at wellpads 4 and 5 before the start of controlled testing. Two performers deployed

228

more than one solution for testing, summing up to 13 CM solutions. Some solutions monitored a

229

subset of equipment groups, while others deployed their solutions in all the equipment groups in

wellpads 4 and 5 (SI Figure S-3). After deployment, performers operated their solutions remotely

231

except when their hardware malfunctioned; in this case, a performer’s team would fix their

hardware during ‘no release’ periods.

shown in Table 1, four solutions were tested in 2023 (Ilonze et al., 2024) relative to the current

238

study (solutions N, F, D, and P). Solutions C, D, and F were also tested in the study by Bell et al.,

Data Analysis

257

Classified data was divided into various quantiles, ranging from 30 to 50 points per bin. The

258

number of points was determined using quantile-based discretization, which produced the highest

259

goodness of fit (R2) for a solution. This approach ensured that each bin used when evaluating the

260

statistical significance. In quantile-based discretization, balanced data bins were generated for

262

various test conditions. A detection fraction, a ratio of the number of TPs to the sum of the number

263

of TPs and FNs (nTPs /(nTPs + nFNs)), was derived from each bin. The detection fractions from

264

all the bins were fit to a POD curve using power functions; the intercept was set to zero for these

265

curves. The POD curve was calculated as a function of the source emission rate, duration, and

266

wind speed.

267

Multiple independent variables could impact the probability of detecting emissions. Therefore, a

268

multivariable logistics regression model was fitted to the detection data to assess the impact of

269

independent variables (wind speed, sensor location relative to the source, wind direction, release

270

duration, temperature, and emission rate) on the probability of a solution detecting emissions (SI

271

Section 8.2). Information on the analysis can be found in the SI sections S7, S10.1, and S10.2.

272

We applied a 5-minute buffer time on the maintenance end time to account for any residual

273

emissions in the atmosphere and to avoid assigning an FP detection to such reports. Additionally,

274

we applied 20-minute buffer times to the start and end times of the experiments to maintain

275

consistency with previous studies and to track the performance of solutions that have been retested

276

effectively.

277

Protocol Constraints

278

The performance of the tested solutions is only representative of the test conditions; therefore,

279

the results cannot be extrapolated to untested conditions. Tested conditions represent the site's

280

structural configuration, prevailing meteorological conditions, duration of controlled releases, and

281

the range of emission rates spanned during testing. Untested conditions include emissions longer

282

than 8 hrs, wind speed greater than 13m s-1, and, generally, atmospheric stabilities during summer.

283

For instance, some CM solutions rely on the accuracy of measurements from emissions that run

284

for extended periods. Since the controlled releases in this study ran for up to a maximum of 8 hrs,

285

the results may not cover the full capabilities of such solutions. Therefore, these untested

13

286

conditions may limit the work's applicability in this study. Testing at the site configuration

287

resembled a simplified upstream production facility. Therefore, results cannot be extrapolated to

288

more complex production facilities.

289

Emission rates ranging from 0.08 to 6.75 kg CH4 hr-1 were tested; however, for most production

290

facilities, there can be larger emission rates not tested in the study due to safety reasons. The

291

protocol implementation requires testing the solution for component emission detection and

292

quantification. However, some solutions operate as full facility monitors and may provide facility-

293

level emission rates rather than detection at the component level. The testing in this study involved

294

steady-state emission rates; however, this may not be the case in production facilities.

295

The detection reports in this study are human-influenced. The protocol requires the performers to

296

infer the presence/absence of emissions based on sensor readings rather than sending the sensor

297

readings directly to the test center. As this is the third implementation, we acknowledge that

298

repeated testing by some solutions may result in well-trained solution algorithms, and as such,

299

detection, localization, and quantification results may have improved substantially for such

300

solutions.

301

Results

302

Overview of the Results

303

Results of a multivariable logistic regression model showed that the emission rate significantly

304

(p<0.05) affected the probability of all solutions to detect emissions except for solution T (SI Table

305

S13). Therefore, POD curves were generated as functions of the emission rate. Other variables

306

tested for their impact on the POD include the release duration, ambient temperature, wind speed,

307

wind direction, and distance to the closest sensor (Tables S4-S16). The DL90 represents the

308

emission rate at which, results indicate, the solution could detect emissions in 90% of cases,

309

regardless of the prevailing meteorological conditions (Bell et al., 2023; Ilonze et al., 2024). In the

310

figures, the DL90 was labeled as NA if it was outside the tested release rate range (0.08 – 6.75 kg

311

CH4 hr-1).

312

Figure 1 compares the POD curves for solutions retested in this study relative to Ilonze et al.,

313

(2024). Figures 2 and 3 show the POD curves for the newly tested solutions. In Figure 1, the red

314

(data points from 2023 testing) and blue (data points from the current testing) markers represent

315

the fraction of controlled releases in a bin classified as TPs. The faded curves in all the plots were

316

derived from bootstrapping the data points to obtain the uncertainty of the POD curve (SI Section

317

S10.1).

The probability of detection against the release rate for PSNs tested in 2023 and 2024. The
90 % DL for both years is based on the controlled release rate range for the current testing (0.08
to 6.75 kg CH4 hr-1). The DL90s of three of four solutions (Solutions D, F, and P) are within the
current study's range of tested release rates, while 1 is outside the tested release rate range (Solution
N).

339

Probability of Detection: In this section, we discuss the solutions' PODs in two categories: PODs

340

within and those outside (> 6.75 kg hr-1) the range of the tested emission rate. Additionally, we

341

perform an inter-solution comparison of the PODs (PSN versus scanning/imaging solutions).

342

Generally, figures 1, 2, and 3 show that 6 out of 13 solutions had DL90s ranging from 0.5 to 6.7

343

kg CH4 hr-1. For the 6 solutions, results indicate that these solutions balance method sensitivity

344

and low FP and FN rates (as in (Ilonze et al., 2024)). Table 2 shows that 5 of the six solutions had

345

the lowest FP rates (less than 20%: 8.0 to 18.9%), and 4 had the lowest FN rates (less than 50%:

346

8.0-34.1%) (SI Section S8.1).

347

Seven of 13 solutions with DL90s outside the controlled release rate range struggle with high

348

FP and FN rates (Table 2). Four of the seven solutions had the highest FP (>20%) and FN (>50%)

349

rates. Most of the tested variables affected the PODs of the 7 solutions, i.e., the distance to the

350

closest sensor, wind speed, duration, wind direction, and temperature (SI Section S8.2). As for

351

these solutions (N, C, U, M, R, T, and W), their DL90s should be used cautiously as they fall

352

outside the range of tested release rates, 0.08 – 6.75 kg CH4 hr-1.

353

Although all solutions had less than 50% FP rates, the percentage of FPs further classified as

354

excess reports for 10 of 13 solutions was high (≥50%). These solutions sent multiple detection

355

reports identifying already paired controlled releases. Multiple emissions identification could be

356

costly, as it would send misleading alerts for repair. Solutions N and W, which have the lowest FP

357

rates overall (4 % and 5 %, respectively), deployed the largest number of sensors (50 and 35,

358

respectively).

359

As for the FNs, 6 of 13 solutions had FN rates greater than 50%. All scanning/imaging solutions

360

had the highest FN rates (> 80%). A high FN rate indicates the likelihood of missing emissions,

361

which could delay repairs. For the scanning/imaging solutions, the scan time of a solution impacts

17

362

how fast a solution identifies an emission. Scanning/imaging solutions also deployed low sensor

363

counts (1 sensor each for solutions I and V, and 7 sensors for solution M; Table 1). This means that

364

they have a likelihood of missing emissions.

The probability of detection against the controlled release rate for scanning/imaging

The DL90 of one solution is within the range of tested release rates. The DL90s for solutions C,
R, T, U, and W are outside the tested emission rate range.

375

Inter-solution POD comparison: The DL90s for 4 PSNs were within the tested emission rate

376

range, ranging from 0.5 to 5.5 kg CH4 hr-1, somewhat better than the scanning/imaging solutions.

377

The DL90s for two scanning/imaging solutions (I and V) were 5.5 and 6.7 kg CH4 h-1, respectively.

378

The DL90 for the other scanning/imaging solution (M) could not be estimated; therefore, this is

379

presented as NA. The 4 PSNs deployed more sensors than scanning/imaging solutions, and had

380

low FP and FN rates, less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Additionally, 3 of the 4 PSNs were

381

previously tested by Ilonze et al., (2024) hence, better performance than scanning/imaging

382

solutions. The DL90s for the remaining 6 PSNs (5 newly tested) could not be estimated or did not

383

produce data that reflected enough trends to estimate a DL90.

Finally, the curves for POD as a function of emission rate for all scanning/imaging solutions

385

reflected a quasi-linear relationship. This suggests a stronger POD and emission rate relationship

386

than the independent variables tested.

The table is presented in decreasing order of the TP rate. Overall, FP in the table represents the fraction of the
detection reports classified as false positives. The FP detection reports were further classified as a nocontrolled release or an extra report. For the FP no-controlled release, this is a detection report sent in when
the test center was not releasing gas. The FP extra report is when a solution sends multiple detection reports
linked to an already TP-classified detection report.

Comparing the POD Performance in the Current Study to the Two Previous Studies

Logistic regression models were used to generate the POD curve and to calculate the Method

392

Detection Limits in Bell et al., (2023). This is referred to as the DL90 in this study and in Ilonze

393

et al., (2024). The controlled releases in the studies by Bell et al., (2023) and Ilonze et al., (2024)

394

ranged from 0.4 to 6.4 kg CH4 h-1 and 0.006 to 7.1 kg CH4 h-1, respectively. The DL90 ranged

395

from 2.7 to 30.1 kg CH4 h-1 in Bell et al., (2023) and from 3.9 to 18.2 kg CH4 h-1 in Ilonze et al.,

396

(2024). Six of 11 and four of 9 solutions had DL90s within the range of controlled release rates in

397

Bell et al., (2023) and Ilonze et al., (2024), respectively.

398

Ilonze et al. relative to this study: The DL90s for the three retested solutions showed substantial

399

improvements, though with increased variability. The DL90s for these solutions ranged from 3.9

400

to 14.1 kg CH4 hr-1 in Ilonze et al. (2024). By the current study, these DL90s ranged from 0.5 to

401

5.5 kg CH4 hr-1, with notable gains for solutions F and P. Solution F’s DL90 improved from 6.2

402

[3.6, 17.4] kg CH4 hr-1 in Ilonze et al., (2024) to 0.5 [0.3, 0.6] kg CH4 hr-1 in the current study.

403

Solution P’s DL90 improved from 6.0 [4.1, 11.8] kg CH4 hr-1 to 3.2 [2.2, 5.7] kg CH4 hr-1 in the

404

current study. The two solutions' improvement in performance can be attributed to continuous

405

testing, improvement in the solution algorithm, and an increased number of sensors in solution P.

406

Solution F in the current study had a DL90 above EPA’s detection threshold (0.4 kg h-1) (US

407

EPA, 2024) for continuous monitoring systems by 0.1 kg CH4 h-1. The EPA regulation requires

408

detecting a facility’s fugitive emissions of 0.4 kg CH4 hr-1 in the presence of baseline emissions,

409

i.e., routine emissions common to most O&G sites. However, the current testing protocol has no

410

baseline emissions.

411

Bell et al. relative to this study: The DL90 for solutions tested in the current study, relative to

412

Bell et al. (2023), partially improved. Three solutions, C, D, and F, were also tested by Bell et al.

413

(2023). The DL90 for solution C could not be estimated in the current study, although the number

414

of sensors doubled. The DL90 remained at 5.5 kg CH4 h-1 for solution D and decreased from 3.4

415

[2.4, 5.4] kg CH4 h-1 to 0.5 [0.3, 0.6] kg CH4 h-1 for solution F. Although the DL90 for solution D

416

remained constant, the upper and lower bounds had a wider range than during testing by Bell et

417

al. (2023). Additionally, solution D has deployed a constant number of sensors since the protocol's

418

first implementation; therefore, the steady performance is attributed to improving the solution

419

algorithm and continuous testing.

420

Localization Precision and Accuracy

421

The protocol required the performers to submit the equipment unit where the solution detected an

422

emission. Localization used the reported equipment unit as a primary metric to establish the

423

precision of each TP detection (SI S9.2). As for the localization accuracy at the equipment unit,

424

this was calculated as a ratio of the number of TP detections at the equipment unit level to the total

425

number of reported detections (nTPEqUnit / (nTP + nFP)) for each solution (SI Section S9.2). We

426

define sensor density as the ratio of the surface area (in hectares) of the test center, i.e., pads 4 and

427

5, to the number of sensors deployed by a performer. Scanning/imaging solutions had higher sensor

428

densities (ha/sensor) as their sensors monitored larger areas than PSNs. The sensor densities for

429

scanning/imaging solutions (I, V, and M) were 0.12, 0.85, and 0.85 ha/sensor. For PSNs, the sensor

430

density ranged from 0.02 to 0.28 ha/sensor.

431

Overall, most solutions (7) presented high precision (> 50%) at the unit level. Although

432

scanning/imaging solutions have higher sensor density, results show that they localize emission

433

sources better than PSNs. All scanning/imaging solutions indicate high precision (> 50%) and

434

accuracy (> 40%) at the unit level (Table 3; SI Figure S-21). The localization precision of

435

scanning/imaging solutions (solutions I, M, and V) ranged from 56.0 % to 84.9%, and the

436

localization accuracy ranged from 43.2% to 80.6% at the unit level. As shown in Table 3, for the

437

PSNs at the unit level, 4 out of 10 solutions achieved precisions of 50% or greater and accuracies

438

of 40% or greater.

The table is organized in decreasing order of the localization precision (for the current testing) at the equipment unit
level. Precision at the unit level refers to a TP detection that identified the correct equipment unit, precision at the group
level refers to a TP detection that identified the correct equipment group, and precision at the facility level refers to a
TP detection that identified an emission from the test center.
Solution U localized emissions to the unit and group levels because its sensors monitored a specific equipment group,
i.e., the tanks on pad 4.

Generally, localization precision and accuracy for solutions tested in previous studies changed

slightly relative to the current study (less than ±22%). The precision and accuracy increased for 2

of 4 solutions relative to Ilonze et al. (2024). For solutions C, D, and F, the precision and accuracy

increased at the unit level relative to Bell et al. (2023) (Table 3). Overall, there is an increase in

precision and accuracy for the 2 of 4 and all three solutions relative to Ilonze et al. (2024) and Bell

447

et al. (2023), respectively. This shows that, as a group, the current study's localization precision

448

and accuracy partially improved compared to the two previous studies. Although the results may

449

indicate partial improvement in precision and accuracy, these changes imply that the solutions’

450

algorithms have improved.

451

Quantification Accuracy

452

Quantification accuracy for all TP detections from all solutions that reported the source emission

453

rate is presented in two ways: as a percentage of single estimates within a factor of 3 and as the

454

relative quantification error. In the current study, 11 solutions reported the source emission rate.

455

The relative quantification error (in %) represents the relative difference between the reported and

456

metered emission rates.

457

Overall, the percentage of single emission estimates within a factor of 3 for the 11 solutions ranged

458

from 31 % to 92% (Table 4). The mean relative error from single estimates for controlled releases

459

(CR) between 0.1 and 1 kg CH4 h-1 and those greater than 1 kg CH4 h-1 for 3 and 9 solutions were

460

less than ±100%, respectively (Table 4). Small emission rates (between 0.1 and 1 kg CH4 h-1),

461

often associated with component leaks, exhibit consistently high relative quantification error for

462

most solutions (8). In contrast, larger emissions (> 1 kg CH4 h-1), often linked to process failures,

463

show lower quantification error for most solutions (9 solutions); this indicates that most CM

464

solutions could be well-positioned to mitigate larger emissions. Sections S8.4 and S10.3 of the SI

465

provide additional information on quantification accuracies.

Comparing the Quantification Accuracy for the Current Study to Ilonze et al.

470

Relative to Ilonze et al. (2024), 3 of 4 solutions reported the source emission rate (Figure 4).

471

Between 57 and 78% of the single estimates were within a factor of 3 during testing by Ilonze et

472

al. (2024). In the current study, between 62% and 93% of the single estimates were within a factor

473

of 3 (Table 4 and Figure 4). The percentage of estimates within a factor of 3 has increased.

474

Additionally, there is a stronger correlation between the reported and actual release rates.

green points are from 2023 quantification data, while those with blue points are from the current
study’s quantification data. Each subplot shows the number of data points whose estimates are
within a factor of 3. The black dotted line represents the 1:1 line; data points along this line
illustrate that the reported equals the actual emission rate. The red dotted lines highlight the region
where the single estimates are within a factor of 3 of the actual emission rates. The R 2 illustrates
the correlation between the reported and actual emission rates. Generally, there is a stronger
correlation between the reported and actual emission rates relative to Ilonze et al. (2024).

488

The overall emissions quantification has improved despite the consistently large quantification

489

errors in single estimates. This improvement can be attributed to consistent testing, the improved

490

emission quantification algorithm of solutions, and an increased number of deployed sensors for

491

solution N. The improvement is illustrated by an increase in the percentage of single estimates

492

within a factor of 3 in the current study, and Ilonze et al. (2024). Additionally, the solutions

493

consistently tested in previous studies had the lowest relative quantification errors for small and

494

large leaks (Table 4).

Detection Time

496

The detection time was calculated as the time between the start time of a controlled release and

497

the time our email-based reporting system received the solution’s detection report. In cases where

498

we received multiple detection report IDs, the time for the first detection report was used for

499

calculation. Generally, the mean detection time of solutions ranged from 5 hrs to 5 days (Figure

500

5). All solutions except solution D took longer (≥ 9 hrs) than the longest duration (8 hrs) of

501

controlled releases in the study. Overall, detection time for these solutions varies widely due to the

502

performers' manual evaluation of the detection report before submission. Additionally, the

503

automated reporting system may have failed for solutions with long detection times, resulting in

504

delayed detection report processing.

505

The mean detection time of solutions in the current study was larger than the mean detection

506

time in Bell et al. (2023) and Ilonze et al. (2024). For the current study, the least mean detection

507

time for 1 of 13 solutions was 5 hrs. For Bell et al. (2023) and Ilonze et al. (2024), 3 of 11 and 4

508

of 9 solutions had a mean detection time of ≤ 5 hrs, respectively. The mean detection time increased

509

for 3 of the four solutions tested by Ilonze et al. (2024).

For solutions I, W, and M, the mean time to detect is over 1 month.

518

Operation Downtime

519

Operation downtime is when a solution is not operational during testing, as a performer reports.

520

The operation downtime for 12 of 13 solutions in this study was ≤ 6.4%, meaning that the 12

521

solutions met EPA’s stipulated maximum operation downtime for continuous monitoring systems

522

(US EPA, 2024). Although the EPA considers operational downtime on a 12-month rolling

523

average, the solutions assessed in the current study demonstrate the ability to operate for more than

524

three months without malfunctioning.

525

Implications

526

This study represents the third implementation of the ADED continuous monitoring protocol. The

527

major findings for the current study are (1) solutions that tested in the two previous studies have

528

improved or held steady in various performance metrics, including lower DL90, lower FP and FN

529

rates, and higher localization accuracies at equipment group and facility levels, (2)

530

scanning/imaging solutions offer higher localization precision and accuracy than most PSNs, and

531

(3) solutions have higher quantification accuracies for larger emissions (> 1 kg CH4 hr-1) than

532

smaller emissions (< 1 kg CH4 hr-1).

533

These results highlight the importance of controlled testing in understanding the potential

534

performance of solutions in the field. Although the newly tested solutions performed well on

535

localization precision and accuracy, these solutions struggle with the probability of detection, have

536

large FP and false negative FN rates, and generally have long detection times. These results suggest

537

that repeat testing, with concomitant attention to solution evaluation and improvement, positively

538

impacts solution performance. Therefore, providing extended testing windows at low cost will

539

likely benefit the development of next-generation LDAQ solutions.

540

Additionally, different solutions perform well on different metrics, indicating that they could or

541

may already be tailored towards desirable functionalities or applicability to certain facility types

542

or leak detection and repair programs. Some solutions have DL90 that qualify for current voluntary

543

and regulatory leak detection programs. Also, these solutions have sufficiently low FP rates,

544

meaning they should be well-positioned for deployment in those programs.

545

Finally, as in prior test programs, release rates did not span the range necessary for many

546

solutions to achieve DL90 within the tested range. Comparing the three release programs to

547

recently approved EPA regulations shows that there is a need for future programs to test above the

29

548

survey mode requirements listed in EPA’s subpart OOOOb (US EPA, 2024) of 15 kg/h. Also, field

549

testing indicates a need for future testing to include non-fugitive emission sources during

550

controlled release testing (Day et al. 2024). Additionally, we have learnt that, with repeated testing,

551

we needed data representative of field performance (Day et al. 2024).

552

To address these concerns, revisions to the controlled testing protocol are underway. Therefore,

553

we propose the following revisions to the controlled testing protocol: 1. Including non-fugitive

554

emissions to fugitive releases; 2. Including more test conditions, such as during summer, to widen

555

the applicability of the test results; and 3. Encouraging performers to define detection thresholds

556

relevant to their solutions. Non-fugitive emission sources are due to normal operational conditions

557

at a facility. This creates non-steady emission rates and introduces temporal emission variation like

558

the field's emission profile. This allows a representative assessment of a solution's performance.
