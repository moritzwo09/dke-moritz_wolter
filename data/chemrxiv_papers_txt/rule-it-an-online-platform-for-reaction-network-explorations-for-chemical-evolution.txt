Abstract
Exploring the chemical space of prebiotic reactions is crucial for understanding the emergence of
life. However, the combinatorial explosion of compounds and the lack of user-friendly computational
tools pose significant challenges. To address these issues, we developed Rule-it, a web platform that
enables prebiotic chemists to build, expand, prune, and visualize chemical reaction networks. The
platform integrates experimental data and provides a comprehensive framework for studying chemical
evolution. By simplifying the generation and analysis of reaction networks, Rule-it aims to advance
research in prebiotic chemistry.

1. INTRODUCTION

Finding the principles that allowed the chemistry of ancient Earth to give place to life might be one of the most
ambitious research goals of modern science. The classical view that started this field considered the creation
of biomolecules from prebiotic components as a milestone that could precede the emergence of life (Miller,
1953). After 70 years of research, numerous prebiotic
pathways leading to biomolecules have been discovered
(Ferris et al., 1972; Kitadai & Maruyama, 2018; RuizMirazo et al., 2014). Various organic compounds can
be produced under hydrothermal conditions (McCollom
& Seewald., 2007), delivered by carbonaceous chondrite
meteorites(Engel & Nagy, 1982), iron meteorites (Elsila et al., 2021), comets (Dworkin et al., 2001) or produced by mineral catalysis (Graaf et al., 2023). Due
to such a diversity of options for prebiotically-available
molecules, scientists can now shift their focus to the principles of self-organization and evolution in chemical systems (Baum & Vetsigian, 2017).
A major problem of organic chemistry is the combinatorial explosion of compounds under certain conditions
(Warr 1997). This phenomenon can be observed, for example, in the classic Milley-Urey experiment (Wollrab
2016) and the formose reaction - a relatively well-studied
autocatalytic cycle (Colón-Santos et al., 2019). However, recent research has shown that there is a certain
level of control among the alleged combinatorial explosions depending on reaction conditions (Baltussen et al.,
2024; Robinson et al., 2022), e.g., the presence of minerbruno.czuviria@upm.es
sokolskyi@wisc.edu

als can constrain the diversity of formose reaction products (Colón-Santos et al., 2019). In parallel to experimental approaches, computational techniques can also
help explore the chemical space spanned by prebiotic
chemistry by generating reaction networks (Arya et al.,
2022; Roszak et al., 2024; Sharma et al., 2021; Wolos et
al., 2020). Reaction networks can be grown from rules
guiding how different functional groups of the seed compounds can react with each other. In the resulting networks, which can be extensive, we should find at least a
partial agreement with reality by incorporating experimental information. However, a critical gap around applying such methodologies is a general lack of integration
of computational approaches into prebiotic chemistry, especially if chemists are assumed to know little or nothing about coding. Therefore, we have created Rule-it,
a web platform for prebiotic chemists to build, explore,
constrain, and compare chemical reaction networks with
their experimental evidence.
2. RESULTS
2.1. Rule-It: a user-friendly chemical network

expansion tool
Applying rule-based generation of chemical-reaction
networks is not easy enough for most users outside the
computational chemistry community. To diminish the
technical barrier preventing the wide adoption of this
methodology, we have implemented our whole network
expansion pipeline (Figure 1) into a user-friendly graphical interface platform named Rule-it. The platform
allows easy and modular reaction rule crafting, reaction network expansion (Figure 1b), pruning (Figure
1c), annotation, and converting chemical names to rules,

among other functionalities. The methodology also visualizes chemical reaction networks as graphs. By allowing each step to generate a whole output that can
be used in the next step, we avoid unnecessary technical burdens on the server side. We also give the user
privacy, as data is not stored, and the ability to modify the intermediate data if necessary. The platform is
available to the public at https://ruleit.streamlit.app/.
The server can be self-hosted using the code at:
https://github.com/brunocuevas/ruleit

2.2. A one-stop framework to study chemical evolution

in prebiotic chemistry
To illustrate the application of Rule-it, we searched
for chemical pathways to generate biologically-relevant
compounds from prebiotic chemistry. Specifically, we focused on a dataset of 670 compounds extracted from an
E. coli Flux-Balance-Analysis metabolism model (Feist
2007) and 154 compounds detected in the composition
of the Murchison meteorite (Vincent 2021) as the starting conditions. This process had five steps: i) generating
the chemical rules that give place to the chemical reaction network; ii) expanding from those rules using the
set of initial seeds used in the experiment; iii) pruning
the resulting network to generate the minimal reaction
network that could produce the experimental evidence;
iv) visualize the network.
The generation of reaction rules is enabled through the
specification of the SMARTS format. However, generating SMARTS can be “mind-bending”, especially if the
users are unfamiliar with chemoinformatics. A common
issue with crafted reaction rules is the emergence of unexpected results. Therefore, we provide a tool to help

rules used in this study.

Fig. 3.— Expansion experiments using the Murchison meteorite
seeds and the set of 48 reactions. Each data point corresponds
to the average of 100 repeats, except for four rounds and 10000
iterations, representing 32 repeats. Each subplot represents the

the user debug their own reaction rules by proposing
positive and negative cases together with the SMARTS
expression. The user can obtain a collection of useful
SMARTS by manually crafting these rules and possibly
using SMARTS from previous work (e.g., Hartenfeller et
al., 2011). In our study-case, we used the tool to craft
48 reaction rules representing 16 types of reversible reactions after around 10 iterations of trial and error (Figure
2; Table S1-2). For simplicity, we avoided reactions
producing any types of rings and focused mostly on carbonyl and nitrogen-containing organics.
The second step requires using those SMARTS to generate a chemical reaction network. In our specific case,
we use the compounds detected in the Murchison meteorite (Table S3) and the rules from Table S1-2. Figure 3 summarizes the number of compounds discovered
under different iterations of this expansion algorithm.
Note that the differences are due to the expansion algorithm’s stochastic nature; however, such variability does
not seem to impact the final number of compounds discovered at every iteration.
These chemical reaction networks are too big to give
insight into which reactions could occur in the system or which structures could exist within the chemical network. Therefore, to answer our question of
how many compounds in E. coli metabolism can be
derived from meteorite composition, we pruned our
meteorite-derived chemical reaction network with the E.

coli dataset (Table S4). The result was a minimal reaction network that produced as many E. coli compounds
as possible, starting from Murchison meteorite soluble organic matter. Based on constrained linear programming,
this method is preceded by searching SMILES from the
molecular names derived from Vincent et al., 2021 for
the meteorite composition and from Feist et al. 2007
for the metabolic compounds. This step can also be executed in our app, which obtains the SMILES by querying
PubChem.
Overall, in the original network produced from 4 iterations of expansion on the meteorite seed set there
are 132625 reactions with 118592 compounds. Following pruning, we detected 73 E. coli compounds (Table
S5) absent in the meteorite seed set produced from 303
reactions. Producing those 73 compounds requires 401
intermediate compounds. As the total number of compounds selected for pruning is 670, this represents a success rate of 11%, which is surprisingly high given the
simplicity of our ruleset.
These much smaller networks are more manageable to
analyze and understand. In the fourth step, we generate a chemical reaction network representation for the
resulting network (Figure 4) that the user can easily
explore. There are also options to download the resulting information in a format that enables visualization in
other software, such as Gephi (Bastian 2009).
Finally, the user can explore processes relevant
to the Origin of Life within the resulting networks.
Among them, the presence of autocatalysis is an important parameter, as it enables molecular self-replication and possibly evolution (Gagrani,
2024; Gagrani et al., 2024).
The app generates input required to run efficient autocatalysis detection using autocatalyticsubnetworks program
(github.com/vblancoOR/autocatatalyticsubnetworks) a matrix of stoichiometric coefficients for each reaction
in the network.
3. DISCUSSION

Digesting large and messy chemical reaction networks
is critical to understanding the emergence of chemical
evolution. However, doing so requires a certain degree
of heterodoxy. While classical organic chemistry experiments are useful for understanding the diversity of prebiotic synthesis pathways, it is important to highlight that
early Earth environments were considerably “messier”
than laboratory conditions (Guttenberg et al., 2017).
Additionally, even trace amounts of certain compounds
could have had a significant role in the origins of life
— just one molecule of a member species is sufficient to
start an autocatalytic cycle (Peng et al., 2022). This
means that disentangling the mess of possible chemical
reactions, including rare reactions often overlooked by
chemists, is critical for understanding life’s origins.
To tackle this problem, we provide an open-source tool
that can help chemists to understand their complex data
and to design new experiments. Combined with new
sources of prebiotic chemistry knowledge, we expect that
Rule-it can fuel a certain degree of advancement in the
field.
4. METHODS

We combine an expansion algorithm with rule-based
reaction generation to explore the chemical pathways
that could have produced the detected compounds from
the initial seed set. The expansion algorithm has been
applied in many different publications (Goldford et al.,
2017, 2019, 2022; Peng et al., 2022; Roszak et al., 2024;
Wolos et al., 2020), and it consists of the successive addition of new chemicals discovered or reachable from previous chemicals. Rule-based chemical reaction generation
enables the exploration of the chemical space by taking advantage of user-provided reaction mechanisms (oxidations, esterifications, etc). These two tools generate
large reaction networks that require careful information
extraction to be compared with experimental results.
4.1. Network expansions
In an expansion algorithm, each round uses the compounds generated by the previous round and the initial
seed compounds to look for new active reactions. The
output of those reactions enlarges the pool of compounds
under use (Figure 1a, 1b). The generation can occur
by considering a static set of initial reactions, similar to
pruning a pre-existing chemical reaction network (CRN),
or by generating a set of reactions using reaction rules or
any other generative mechanism. In our case, we use the
second mechanism, as it allows us to explore a more extensive chemical space (Arya et al., 2022; Roszak et al.,
2024; Sharma et al., 2021; Wolos et al., 2020). However,
one common problem of generative network expansions,
where new reactions can be considered in each iteration
of the network, is the possible combinatorial explosion
of products across different expansion rounds. Therefore, heuristics to enable the efficient exploration of that
space are advisable. In our case, we use a simple random exploration of the chemical space to define a set of
reactions ri and their probabilities pi . At each iteration,
we sample from the distribution of reaction probabilities and compute a reaction on a set of prefiltered reactants. After an N number of iterations, we remove all the
redundant reactions. We also enable filtering reactions
based on a discriminator, which can be any mechanism

removing a function because of some property. We implement discrimination based on detecting compounds
with uncommon valences and molecular masses that are
too high.
4.2. Reaction rule generation

We use SMARTS to define chemical patterns that enable chemical transformations. However, crafting these
SMARTS can be tricky, as it requires a certain degree
of mental gymnastics. Therefore, we first implemented a
graphical program to help debug SMARTS to test positive and negative examples.
We implemented the generation of reactions using the
RdKit library. Before any expansion, we pre-compute
lists of valid chemical reactants for each reaction reactant
template and proceed to the stochastic sampling during
each iteration of the reaction network algorithm.
4.3. Reaction network pruning

The resulting reaction networks can have thousands of
reactions and molecules, from which only a few might be
relevant. We wish to reduce our initial chemical reaction
networks to smaller networks reproducing experimental
evidence: the initial set of compounds and the detected
compounds. We implemented a pruning algorithm based
on three steps. First, we need to convert complex analytical techniques to produce a set of computer-readable
molecules. We use the conversion of molecule names from
a given experimental dataset to SMILES through the
PubChem database API. Second, we look for those compounds in the generated CRN, as only a part of the network may be necessary to cover some or all detected compounds. We do this by removing factors in SMILES that
allow the recognition of identical molecules (e.g., charge,
stereoisomers) and by producing truncated InChiKeys.
Finally, we attempt to solve the minimal number of reactions that connect the detected outputs with the seeds.
For this, we state the problem as a linear programming
solvable flux problem, in which seed compounds are the
only fluxes in the system, reactions convert any molecules
into other molecules, and all molecules can be exported.
Adding the condition of a minimal positive flux in the
output compounds and minimizing the overall reaction
flux enabled the generation of minimal chemical reaction
networks that explain the products (Figure 1c, 1d).
