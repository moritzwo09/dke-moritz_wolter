Keywords: CALF-20, CO2 capture and storage, environmental gas uptake, positron annihilation

Abstract. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. Adsorption in porous
sorbents offers a promising method to mitigate CO2 emissions by capturing and storage. The zinc-triazole-oxalatebased metal-organic framework CALF-20 demonstrates high CO2 capacity, low H2O affinity, and low CO2
adsorption heat, enhancing energy efficiency while maintaining stable performance over multiple
adsorption/desorption cycles. This study examines CO2 adsorption in CALF-20. Using the combination of positron
annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), in situ-Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) analyses, and gas adsorption
experiments, we elucidate the CO2 adsorption mechanisms in CALF-20 under various temperatures, and humidity
levels, simulating ambient conditions. The variable temperature PALS experiments demonstrate that CO₂
molecules are spatially localized within the CALF-20 cages, leaving temperature- and pressure-dependent gaps
between them. PALS results indicate that CO2 initially spreads across cage centers, 1D chains, and ultimately
adheres to pore walls. Interestingly, positronium intensity, which increases with CO₂ adsorption pressure, closely
aligns with the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm and reflects gas uptake behaviour. Moreover, we explore the
adsorption characteristics of relative humidity (RH) and humid CO₂ in CALF-20. At low RH in pure humidity run,
water molecules are sparsely adsorbed within the framework, forming isolated clusters or small oligomers with
minimal hydrogen bonding. Above 35% RH, water molecules begin to form interconnected hydrogen-bond
networks that fill the cages, significantly altering the material's free volumes. In humid CO₂ experiment,

competitive interactions between CO₂ and water are observed, where CO₂ initially disrupts the propagation of
water, but at higher RH, water molecules form more extensive hydrogen-bond networks. This competition
influences both the cage and inter-granular spaces, with the latter becoming larger and more flexible as water fills
the framework. The synergy between in situ-PALS, in situ-PXRD, and gas adsorption techniques provides a
comprehensive understanding of CALF-20's potential for efficient CO2 capture under varying environmental
conditions.

1. Introduction

During the world climate conference in 2021, 153 countries agreed on a Glasgow Climate Pact keeping the 1.5°C
target of global warming temperature within reach, with plans to revisit and tighten their emissions targets by
2030.[1] The persistent rise in human-driven CO2 emissions continues to intensify climate change, underscoring
the critical need for effective carbon capture strategies.[2] As temperatures rise and environmental challenges
unfold, the demand for innovative approaches to reduce carbon emissions grows steadily. Separation and capture
of greenhouse gases from dilute emissions are among the seven most important separation processes, which are
responsible for 45-55% of energy consumption in industry.[3] Various approaches, such as amine scrubbing,
membrane separation, cryogenic distillation, and chemical looping [4], have been explored to address this
challenge, and the adsorption of CO2 from air under different environmental conditions emerges as a promising
pathway due to its cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity.[5,6]
It is desirable to choose adsorbents that have a high CO2 capacity, a low N2 and H2O affinity, and a relatively low
CO2 adsorption heat to conserve energy while retaining good CO 2 purity, recovery, and productivity.[7,8] Various
types of adsorbents are being investigated for CO2 capture, such as activated carbon,[9] zeolites,[10] silica gel,[11]
metal oxides,[12] and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The main challenges of well-established industrial
adsorbents such as zeolites and silica gels are quite high adsorption enthalpy and co-adsorption of water, which is
in most cases present in the gas mixture. On the other hand, activated carbons tend to exhibit non-polar surface
and therefore low selectivity towards CO2.
MOFs are a class of hybrid nanoporous crystalline materials that are constructed of metal ions or clusters connected
by organic linkers using modular building principles. [13] MOFs have attracted much attention as potential
adsorbents for CO2 capture due to their high surface area, tuneable pore size and shape, adjustable functionality,
and structural diversity.[14–16] Different approaches are proposed for enhancing CO2 capture in MOFs including the
introduction of coordinative unsaturated metal sites, amine functionalization, modulation of hydrophobicity of the
pores, and the mixture thereof.[14,16–18] At the forefront of this strive is CALF-20 (Zn), a zinc-based MOF, first
reported by Shimizu et al.,[19] distinguished by its hydrophobicity, high scalability, and robust structural integrity.
With a surface area of ca. 530 m²/g[19,20] and an average pore size of 6–7 Å[20–22], CALF-20 (Zn) demonstrates a
remarkable capacity and selective CO2 adsorption[23] at desired conditions.[21] Its unique framework, composed of
1,2,4-triazole and oxalate ligands confers stability in harsh environments.[21] The necessity of capturing CO2 under
fluctuating conditions is emphasized by the varying concentrations of CO 2 found in diverse industrial emissions
and atmospheric contexts. CALF-20 (Zn) exhibits exceptional versatility in maintaining operational efficacy
across a range of temperatures and pressures, positioning it as an indispensable tool in global efforts to mitigate

CO2 emissions.[5] Its capabilities are augmented through the incorporation of functional groups that amplify its
affinity to CO2, thereby optimizing the adsorption process.[2] Within the PrISMa (Process-Informed design of
tailor-made Sorbent Materials) platform, which includes the comprehensive screening of materials including CO 2
source, destination, capture technology, and geographical regions, CALF-20 was identified among the topperforming materials for further study in terms of more detailed process modelling and investigation for
technological development.[24] Besides that, recently the guest-induced flexibility in CALF-20 was
discovered.[20,25] It was found that under humid conditions, the structure undergoes a phase transition from αCALF-20 to β-CALF-20, accompanied by a minor contraction and adsorption of water molecules.[20] This
transition was studied by a combination of in situ PXRD and total scattering. However, the authors pointed out the
challenges associated with characterizing CO2 adsorption properties of β-CALF-20 phase due to the reversibility
and fast kinetics of α-β-α transitions. Further in-depth structural studies result in a number of phases, most of which
are close to β-phase in terms of porosity.[25]
To this end, studying gas adsorption dynamics on the highly scalable CALF-20 MOFs is essential to gain insights
into the intricate processes at play. This is important for CO 2 capture under varying conditions, where the
adsorption behaviour may shift. This approach enables the elucidation of the dynamic interactions between gas
molecules and the porous structure of CALF-20, potentially offering a clearer understanding of CALF-20's
performance in different environmental conditions. [26]
For a comprehensive insight into the CO2 adsorption dynamics of CALF-20 (Zn), positron annihilation lifetime
spectroscopy (PALS) stands out as an invaluable tool.[27–30] PALS can differentiate the subtleties of pore filling
and emptying processes,[28,29,31] providing insights into the adsorption mechanisms and molecular packing within
the porous materials e.g., MOFs. This non-destructive technique has proven to be sensitive to conformational,
structural, and microenvironmental transformations, which are crucial in understanding the molecular organization
and transport properties within CALF-20 (Zn). More details about porosimetry by PALS are available in SI, Appx.
S1. Briefly, PALS utilizes the annihilation characteristics—quantified by lifetime and intensity—of orthopositronium (o-Ps), a quasi-stable bound state formed by an electron and a positron with parallel spins (Appx. S1),
to probe the microstructural properties of materials.[28,32–36] In porous materials, o-Ps annihilates with a lifetime
determined by probability of its bound positron annihilation with an electron of parallel spin from the pore walls
(in empty pores) or from adsorbents and guests within the pores. This process, known as "pick-off" annihilation,
occurs at a rate that depends on the size of the pores and the accommodated substances. Consequently, the lifetime
of o-Ps is exceptionally sensitive to the local electronic environment (due to adsorption, for example) and can
provide detailed information about changes in size and shape of unoccupied spaces. Meanwhile, o-Ps intensity
indicates the formation and trapping probabilities of o-Ps, which are influenced by pore density, connectivity,
surface area, and chemistry.[37–40] In this regard, PALS can be employed as a complementary tool alongside other
chemical and spectroscopic methods to characterize CO2 adsorption in CALF-20 under environmental conditions,
particularly in scenarios where some of these methods face limitations related to temperature, pressure, or
humidity. Additionally, the processes of adsorption and pore filling can result in the formation of closed or
restricted pores that traditional gas adsorption methods may fail to detect, whereas o-Ps can effectively identify
these structures. Therefore, we believe that PALS is an informative new addition for understanding the adsorption
dynamics at different conditions of CALF-20, which can lead to improvements in the material’s design and
functionality, making it more effective in reducing CO2 emissions.

To advance our understanding of CO2 capture, this study investigates the adsorption dynamics on CALF-20 (Zn)
across various conditions taking advantage from PALS capabilities. This entails conducting meticulous treatments
including a control of the sample temperature between 253 K and 373 K under vacuum, followed by in situ CO2
adsorption experiments and full-pressure scans within the same temperature range during PALS measurements.
Furthermore, we executed comprehensive full-scale humid CO2 adsorption experiments, spanning humidity levels
from 11% to 98%. Additionally, our investigation is complemented by in situ-PXRD analysis and physisorption
experiments, conducted under identical conditions allowing us to compare the results with in situ gas adsorption
data obtained via PALS, thus offering a holistic understanding of CALF-20's adsorption behaviour.

2. Results and discussions

Prior to any experimental procedures, the as-received sample was annealed at 423 K for 10 h under a dynamic
vacuum of ca. 1.5×10-6 mbar, as detailed in the method section.

2.1. Thermal effect on CALF-20 porosity

One primary objective of this study was to investigate CO 2 adsorption dynamics in CALF-20 under different
temperatures. In order to distinguish temperature effects from adsorption induced deformation, we initially
conducted PALS measurements[41] at varying temperature over a range from 253 K to 373 K in a vacuum (1.5×106

mbar), with 2-hour intervals per step. The activated sample was first heated to 373 K, then gradually cooled to

253 K at a heating/cooling rate of 2.5 K/min.
PALS analysis using PALSFit[42] revealed that there are two resolvable o-Ps components with distinct lifetimes
(ca. 4.5-4.34 ns and 33.3-34.5 ns, Table 1) in CALF-20. The short-lived o-Ps lifetime (τcage) corresponds to square
cross-section channels of about 0.60-0.64 nm, closely matching the crystallographically calculated cages of CALF20 in the α-phase (Appx. S2, Fig. S1). The long-lived o-Ps lifetime (τgrain) corresponding to gaps of around 1.5 nm
is commonly interpreted as annihilation between grains (shown in SI, Fig. S2) as noted in Table 1. This component
may also include a fraction of o-Ps annihilating from delocalized Bloch states as discussed below. The analysis
indicates also that about one-quarter (Icage + Igrain in Table 1) of positrons in CALF-20 form o-Ps. The results in
Table 1 suggest a weak dependence of o-Ps parameters, and thus cages in CALF-20 remain in the α-phase over
the 253 K to 373 K temperature range in a vacuum. The cage size, as probed by o-Ps in Table 1, negligibly increases
with increasing the temperature between 253K and 373K. Therefore, any greater changes observed during CO2
dosing in the next section are likely attributable to the adsorption process.

2.2. Isothermal CO2 adsorption at varying temperatures

To explore the CO2 adsorption course in CALF-20, we investigated its temperature-dependent adsorption using
PALS. In the following, we have discussed the lifetimes and intensities separately. The discussion of hysteresis
noticed in some curves and variation of τgrain are detailed in SI, Appx. S3 and Fig. S3, respectively.

2.2.1. o-Ps lifetime and cage filling

As CO2 is introduced at different temperatures, significant changes occur in the o-Ps lifetimes and intensities. For
clarity, the entire course of changes can be best traced in the pressure range of 5-1000 mbar at room temperature
(Fig. 1a and SI, Appx. S3). The change in τcage consists of three stages:
1.

Lack of any change in lifetime below a certain pressure threshold value.

2.

Sigmoidal decrease in lifetime that can be well described by equation

𝝉𝒄𝒂𝒈𝒆 =

𝝉𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒕𝒚 − 𝝉𝒇𝒊𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒅
𝒍𝒏(𝒑⁄𝒑½ )
𝟏+𝒆 𝒌

1

+ 𝝉𝒇𝒊𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒅

where p is CO2 pressure, τempty, τfilled, p½, and k are fitting parameters meaning o-Ps lifetimes before and after
sigmoidal change, CO2 pressure at the middle of the sigmoidal change, and width of sigmoidal change,
respectively.
3.

Slow logarithmic decrease in τcage with p.

This pattern is observed at all studied temperatures; however, the sigmoidal change occurs at a very low pressure
of several mbar at 253 K, while it spreads above the maximum CO2 pressure of 1000 mbar at 350 K and 373 K.
Nevertheless, eq. 1 was fitted for all temperatures (Fig. 1a and Table S1). Given only the partial curves at T = 350
and 373 K, fitting was challenging. Therefore, we used fixed values from Fig. S9 in all fits by extrapolating τfilled,
assuming a linear change with temperature, and weighted the values with errors to ensure consistency.
The decrease in o-Ps lifetime in MOFs often results from complex interactions of o-Ps with metal nodes.[36]
However, for CALF-20, there is no indication of any effect other than the pick-off, which directly relates to the
size of the free volumes. Hence, the smaller lifetime implies varying degrees of cage filling with CO 2 at different
temperatures. Because the molecular diameter of CO2 (ca. 0.3 × 0.6 nm[43]) is comparable with the size of the
CALF-20 cage, even a single CO2 molecule acts as a blockage of the pore and forms a potential barrier for o-Ps.
So, the o-Ps probe detects an average distance between the blockages, which can consist of one or more molecules.
In this context, the sigmoidal change observed in Fig. 1a is the shortening of the distance between blockages from
the infinity (open channel) to a certain minimum distance of Van der Waals radius due to filling cages with
subsequent CO2 molecules. This distance between molecules can be calculated assuming a cuboid shape of free
volume (Fig. 2a and Table S3). At pressure just above the pore filling step in the τcage isotherm (when lifetime
decreased by 99% of its total change) this gap is 0.45-0.50 nm long, i.e. of a size that can accommodate one or two
CO2 molecules. Below 298K, where the step in τcage is observed at the pressure below 60 mbar further increase in

pressure causes a reduction in the average gap length (Lgap), which rate seems to be independent of temperature.
Therefore, at 1000 mbar Lgap increases with temperature at a rate of 1.5 pm/K starting from 0.38 nm at 253 K (Fig.
2a). These two effects, Lgap decreases with pressure and increases with temperature, reflect changes of the CO2

arrangement in the cages of CALF-20. There is another possibility that o-Ps exerts pressure on CO2 molecules,
repels them, and thus Lgap increases. This effect, known as “bubble” formation, is observed in bulk liquids.[44]
However, as explained in the SI “main cages and Ps bubble”, Ps bubble is not expected in the microporous CALF20 cages. Therefore, it is not justified to ascribe the changes in the gap size to the interaction of CO 2 with o-Ps.
The sigmoidal change related to cage filling with CO2 can be described by two parameters; (i) p½, the CO2 pressure
at which τcage is halfway from the maximum value (τempty) to the minimum value (τfilled) when the τcage change is
finished and (ii) k, the dimensionless parameter describing the rate of the τcage change, where
i.

p½ changes exponentially with temperature from tens of mbar at 253 K to over 1000 mbar at 373 K
(Fig. 2b).

ii.

k increases linearly (i.e. width increases exponentially like p½ because pressure in eq. 1 is introduced
in the logarithmic scale, so for greater p½ the same k value means greater width of the sigmoidal change)
with temperature in the range of 253-320 K and then it seems to stabilize for higher temperatures (Fig.
S8). It should be remembered that the sigmoidal change above 320 K is incomplete within the measured
pressure range and these results can be inaccurate.

2.2.2. Ps intensities and adsorption mechanism

The intensities of both o-Ps components undergo the sigmoidal change with increasing CO2 pressure (Fig. 3, left).
The intensity of the intergranular component (Igrain) changes in almost the same way as the o-Ps lifetime in cages
(Fig. S5), following a function like that in eq. 1. The strong correlation between pressure dependences of fitted
τcage and Igrain (Fig. 2b) confirms that of o-Ps annihilating between grains originate from inside the cages. Filling
the cages with CO2 results in blocking their outlets, preventing o-Ps migration to the intergranular spaces. Possibly,
at higher temperatures the mobility of CO2 increases and it can easily migrate to the center of the cage, leaving
longer open ends that increase o-Ps intensity outside grains when cages are filled (Ifilled in Table S2). This effect
can be also related to the greater kinetic energy of o-Ps at higher temperatures. Alternatively, Igrain in fact contains
signals from o-Ps in delocalized Bloch states, which spread over the periodic structure of CALF-20 instead of
localization in a single channel. In such a case, their formation and annihilation are affected by the presence of
CO2 within the cages. This is thoroughly explained below.
More intriguing is the change in o-Ps intensity in cages (Icage) with CO2 pressure (Fig. S6). One would expect it
mirrors Igrain, since o-Ps, unable to escape the cages, will annihilate with the lifetime of τcage instead of τgrain.
Although the expected increase in Icage occurs and is approximately equal to the decrease in Igrain (Fig. S5), it is
clearly shifted towards higher pressures (Fig. 2b). This shift ranges from almost two times greater pressure at
253 K to over three times at 320 K, and possibly more at higher temperatures, but this exceeds 1000 mbar and
cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. An additional channel of Ps migration outside grains is expected
to justify high Igrain from a relatively large CALF-20 crystals (Appx. S4, Fig. S10). The origin of additional
“intergranular” o-Ps may be o-Ps from delocalized (hot) Bloch states[39,45] spreading outside the grains, where
disappearance of the periodic structure of CALF-20 causes their localization. If this is the main source of I grain,
its decrease is related to τcage, reflecting a disruption of the periodic structure. In contrast, “intragranular” o-Ps
can hardly get outside grains and changes in I cage are only slightly related to the migration of o-Ps and reflect
other processes in the cages that are hardly related to o-Ps migration. The localized and delocalized o-Ps states
are discussed in the SI section ‘o-Ps parameters during in situ CO2 adsorption’.
Notably, the changes in Icage and Igrain over the pressure course aids in predicting the adsorption mechanism within
CALF-20. To explore the mechanism, we focus on their sigmoidal changes during CO2 adsorption. For clarity, we
have selected the Icage and Igrain curves at 295 K as a function of adsorption pressure and divided the sigmoidal part
of Igrain (the fast-changing parameter) into three sections; A, B, and C, while point D is assigned to represent the
change beyond the sigmoidal transition (Fig. 3, left), to guide the discussion.
From vacuum until point A in Fig. 3, left, both Icage and Igrain are unchanged. Since o-Ps intensity correlates to pore
surface, hence the unchanged intensities suggest no pronounced change in inner cage surface. This indicates that
few CO2 molecules are adsorbed at this pressure range and probably they locate in the center of the cage. As
adsorption develops reaching point B (middle of the I grain sigmoidal transition), Igrain declines but Icage still
unaffected, highlighting the shift mentioned above. Since the most probable binding sites of CO2 in CALF-20 are
in the middle of the cages, where the oxygen atoms of the oxalate groups in the framework serve as primary
binding sites,[19] the introduction of CO2 will disrupt the periodicity required to form the Bloch states and, therefore,
reduces total Ps formation (Fig. S7), but only in the part that can localize outside grains (i.e. I grain). This initiate
changes in Igrain, while formation of Ps in the bulky part (Icage) is not affected and the shift is noticed. At this point,
8

gaps between CO2 molecules are expected to get smaller inside the cage as τcage decreases (Fig. 1a). When
advancing to point C, additional CO2 molecules are introduced, which may form 1D chains along the channel.
These chains further disrupt the periodicity of the cage. Consequently, the delocalized o-Ps does not actually form.
Icage starts to increase because, in addition to electrons from CALF-20, electrons from CO2 contribute more and
more to the formation of o-Ps. Finally, during stage D, Icage reaches its maximum and Igrain approaches its minimum.

Figure 3. Left) changes of Icage and Igrain as functions of adsorption pressure in CALF-20 at 295 K. Right) Sketch
illustrating the anticipated CO2 adsorption mechanism within CALF-20 based on o-Ps intensities.

In this region, Icage increases by ca. 11.4 %, while Igrain decreases by only 9.3 % when compared to vacuum. The
overcompensated increase in Icage (only at 295 K and below) reveals an increase in the total o-Ps formation (also
seen in Fig. S7). This supports the argument that the changes in I cage and Igrain originate from independent sources.
The obvious cause of the increase in o-Ps intensity is usually an increase in surface area. Hence, the increase of
Icage along stage D likely results from the filling of numerous free spaces with CO 2, which not only occupies the
central regions of the cages but also fits into the free spaces between the organic “pillars” connecting the metallic
nodes in CALF-20. Moreover, the increase in Icage is not accompanied by an increase in τcage, which can be
explained if o-Ps is trapped only in the central regions of the cages (between CO 2 molecules) rather than in the
smaller spaces between the “pillars.” This is justified because the smaller spaces between the pillars are connected
to the larger cage centers, making it energetically favorable for o-Ps to migrate from the smaller to the larger free
spaces. Additionally, the shifting of the CO2 molecules from the cage center to the cage sides at high pressures
leaves more empty spaces in the center that can host o-Ps, which may also contribute to the increase in Icage (stage
D in Fig. 3). The discussion about the adsorption mechanism based on the intensities is summarized in the sketch
in Fig. 3, right.
Detailed discussions about variations of the total o-Ps intensity are provided in the “o-Ps intensity” section in the
SI, Appx. S3.

2.2.3. Cage o-Ps intensity as a CO2 uptake indicator

As discussed above, Fig. 1a illustrates the pore filling mechanism in CALF-20, derived from in situ PALS data,
and provides unique complementary information to the adsorption data (Fig. 1b). In Fig. 1b, the volumetric CO2
adsorption experiments at the same temperatures and pressure range reveal a Langmuir-type isotherms with the
uptake at 1000 mbar ranging from 1.4 mmol g-1 at 373 K to 6.0 mmol g-1 at 253 K. Notably, the evolution of τcage
and Icage provide the complementary information on the pore filling mechanism indicating nearly complete pore
filling before the saturation is reached. This is supported by the behaviour of p1/2 in Fig. 2b derived from fitting of
τcage and Icage and from CO2 physisorption, where it increases with temperature but with different rates. The Icage
(Fig. S6) directly correlates with the CO2 adsorption isotherm (Fig. 1b) as shown in Fig. 4 for isotherms at 295 K
as an example. This encouraged us to explore the Icage in more detail. The shape of Icage resembles that of a type I
isotherm, [7,19] indicating it reflects the amount of CO2 uptake. It would be beneficial to analyse if the change in

situ PALS during CO2 adsorption at 295 K.
Icage can be traced by a known adsorption isotherm model. In Fig. S6, Icage exhibits a sigmoidal shape, which can
be best described by the following equation:

Here, the parameters have the same meaning as in eq. 1. Eq. 2 can be rearranged in the following form (derivation

Eq. 3 can be regarded as a modified version of Langmuir–Freundlich (Sips) isotherm,[46] which takes the form:
𝒒𝒆 =

𝒒𝒎 × 𝑲𝒔 × 𝑪𝒏

where qe represents the amount of gas adsorbed at equilibrium, qm is the maximum adsorption capacity, Ks is the
proportional constant or Sips constant, C is the equilibrium gas concentration, and n is the dimensionless Sips
exponent. By comparing eqs. 3 and 4 we observe that Icage follows the Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm with an
additional term,

𝐼𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑦
1+𝑅×𝑝𝑘

. This term, involving Iempty, likely arises from the formation of o-Ps on the adsorption-free

sites on the walls of CALF-20 at a given pressure. The terms in eq. 3 can be interpreted as representing CO₂
adsorption in the centers of the cages, along with the gradual filling of the open framework walls by CO₂ adsorbed.
Additionally, the fitting exponent k in Icage serves as a heterogeneity factor, similar to n in Sips isotherm. The
reliability of the fitting parameters is shown in Table 2. However, at 373 K, the lack of sigmoidal behaviour in Icage
across all pressure values (Fig. S6) leads to unreliable fitting, and thus, the corresponding values have been omitted
from Table 2 and other related figures.

Although we illustrated that CO2 adsorption isotherm (as seen by Icage) adheres the Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm,
other studies have indicated that the CO2 adsorption is better described by a dual-site Langmuir isotherm.[7]
Notably, the Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm accounts for heterogeneous adsorption sites, whereas the Langmuir
isotherm assumes uniform adsorption sites. The fitted heterogeneity factor k for Icage is depicted in Fig. S8. It
follows very closely the k values for τcage and Igrain, which confirms that despite the pressure shift, change in these
parameters result from the same effect.

2.3 Humidity and humid CO2 adsorption

This section is focused on structural changes in CALF-20 during CO2 adsorption in a humid environment,
simulating CO2 capture from flue gases. The experiment was conducted at RT with 970 mbar of CO 2 across relative
humidity levels from 11% to 98%, and results were compared to CALF-20 exposed to humidity alone. The 0%

RH was realized by using molecular sieves to adsorb water from the sample chamber producing either dry air
(reference for pure humidity experiment) or dry CO 2 (reference for humid CO2 experiment). During the humid
CO2 exposure, both humidity and CO2 were simultaneously introduced to the sample to mimic competition
between H2O and CO2. The sample was reactivated in vacuum at 423 K for 4 h after each exposure, as detailed in
the experimental section.

2.3.1. Water vapor adsorption

Adsorption. Adsorption of water vapor on CALF-20 sample at 298 K was conducted (Appx. S5, Fig. S11 (bottom))
in order to show the correlation between the PALS and adsorption data. The isotherm is similar to that reported by
Shimizu and co-authors.[19] The adsorption branch indicates the steep water uptake in the pressure range p/p 0 = 0
– 0.4. At higher pressure, less water is adsorbed in the pores. The desorption branch follows the adsorption showing
a narrow hysteresis in the whole pressure range, originating from the slow adsorption kinetics of water vapour.

2.3.2. Ps components during pure humidity exposure
Cages. In the pure humidity run, a step increase in τcage of 1 ns between 0% and 11% RH is observed (Fig. 5a).
The decrease in o-Ps pick-off annihilation rate (increase in lifetime) shows that water somehow screens the
interaction between o-Ps (already formed in the bulky parts) and the electrons on the pore walls. This suggests
that, unlike CO2, adsorbed water is initially located not in the center but on the periphery of the cages. After that,
CALF-20 exhibits two distinct regions of τcage with 35-50% RH as a transition region (Fig. 5a). Below 35% RH,
τcage fluctuates around ~ 5.5 ns. As noted by Oktavian et al.,[47] the radial distribution function analysis suggests
that at low RH, water molecules position themselves near the oxygen atoms of the oxalate linkers and further away
the Zn atoms, resembling a hydrophobicity. Water molecules thus prefer direct cooperative contact, forming zero
or at most one hydrogen bond, resulting in isolated water molecules or small oligomers being adsorbed.[22] This
minimal hydrogen bond concentration at low RH slightly affects τ cage, with its variability screening o-Ps
interactions with the few water molecules present in the cages. Above 35% RH, τcage shows an abrupt reduction to
~1.5 ns between 35% and 50% RH and stabilizes at this value regardless of the RH level. The steep transition in
τcage between 35 and 50 % RH may indicate the onset of cage filling, aligning with water isotherm in Fig. S11
(bottom), which starts to saturate at almost the same values of relative pressure. However, the τcage value of 1.5 ns
at RH > 50 % is shorter than the o-Ps lifetime of 1.87 ns in bulk water (Ps bubble) or 2.15 ns in water confined in
SBA-3 with 2 nm pores.[30] The lifetime of 1.5 ns corresponds to the residual water-free spaces with size of ca. 0.3
nm that are present in the cages.[27] These water-free spaces are expected because studies have demonstrated that
at higher RH levels, water form complex hydrogen-bonding networks and quasi-1D molecular wires within the
MOF cage,[26,48] and spaces may exist between water chains.
Between 0-35% RH, Icage (Fig. 5c) gently decreases reaching 3 % at 35 % RH. Like the discussion of τ cage, this
reduction in Icage may originate from the low amount of adsorbed water. Above 35 % RH, Icage starts to rise,
reaching 12-15 % at RH ≥ 50 %. According to Llewellyn et al., [22] at high values of partial pressure p/p0 (∝ RH),
percolation occurs, causing neighbouring water chains to interconnect. These interconnected water chains begin

Figure 5. Impact of 970 mbar CO2 adsorption in CALF-20 as a function of relative humidity on: a) cage o-Ps
lifetime (τcage) - right axis shows the derived size of the square cross-section of cages, b) grain o-Ps lifetime (τgrain),

to form clusters around the inner pore surface, [22] potentially creating spaces in between. This increase in the
surface area along with detachment of water molecules from walls, which gives o-Ps an opportunity to repel them,
could explain the observed growth of Icage.
Inter-grain spaces. τgrain in Fig. 5b in the absence of CO2 also exhibits a three-region dependence on RH i.e., 0-35
%, 35 – 50 %, and 50 – 98 %. At RH below 35 %, τgrain slightly decreases, likely due to the presence of some water
molecules in the intergranular spaces, but mostly in the cages, where they affect the delocalized o-Ps reducing its
intensity and, in consequence, the average lifetime of migrated and delocalized o-Ps. Next, it increases linearly up
in the RH range between 35% and 50%, and then stabilizes around 60 ns. This increase in τ grain indicates an
enlargement of the spacing between CALF-20 layers or grains. This might be a result of enhanced structural
flexibility, leaving larger spaces between grains, but more likely water condenses (supported by the increasing
branch of water adsorption isotherm in Fig. S11) at high humidity level and fills the smaller spaces in the grain
spaces leaving the larger spaces unfilled. This can lead to a longer lifetime for o-Ps annihilating in the residual
larger spaces. Alternatively, the suppression of re-migration of o-Ps to the cages is responsible for the increase in
τgrain, which is described in detail in the SI chapter “Humidity and Humid CO2 in CALF-20”.
Igrain drops between the dry state (0% RH) and the first humidity point (11%). This drop is not compensated in Icage,
and it indicates lower o-Ps formation as previously discussed. Again, this would mean that the inner pore surface
13

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1xc9h ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7759-0315 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

is altered and the number of available sites to form the delocalized o-Ps becomes less. Subsequently, Igrain varies
between 4% and 6% at RH ranging from 11% to 35% (Fig. 5d), likely due to some adsorbed water molecules
between grains. At RH = 43%, Igrain falls sharply to about 2%, and continues to decrease to 1.2 – 1.5% at higher
RH levels. Aligning with the discussion of τgrain, this abrupt reduction in Igrain can be attributed to the presence of
residual larger intergranular spaces, while the smaller intergranular spaces, which constitute the majority, have
already been filled.

2.3.3. Ps components during humid CO2 at RT
Cages. In this part, CO₂ at 970 mbar is introduced together with humidity at RT. The 970-mbar pressure was
specifically chosen to observe the most pronounced effects on the material's porosity and adsorption dynamics by
PALS. While this pressure exceeds typical environmental conditions, it enhances the differentiation of changes in
o-Ps lifetimes and intensities, thereby facilitating a clearer interpretation of the underlying adsorption mechanisms.
This approach provides insights that can later be extrapolated to more realistic conditions at lower CO₂ pressures.
Once the RT humid CO2 is applied, τcage decreases, but with distinct characteristics. Initially, it drops from 1.95 ns
to 1.8 ns between 0 and 40% RH (Fig. 5a). The corresponding cage size changes from 0.43 nm to 0.41 nm.
Although it has been noted that humid CO2 induces a phase change from α-CALF-20 to β-CALF-20 above 23 %
RH,[20] from Ps lifetime we cannot unambiguously attribute the change in cage sizes solely to this phase change
due to the progressive cage filling. In humid CO2 at low RH, the uptake of CO2 is favored,[19] but water molecules
coexist. The oxygen atoms of the oxalate groups in the framework serve as primary binding sites for both H 2O and
CO2.[22] Consequently, there will be a competitive interaction between H 2O and CO2 in CALF-20, due to their
shared preference for the same void regions and similar interaction energies with the framework. Considering this,
at low water content (up to 40% RH), the interaction between water and CO 2 (or oppositely – the interaction
screening) may promote partial pore filling in addition to a possible phase change. This implies that the blockages
created by CO2, as described previously, are not entirely closed, allowing water molecules to intrude between
them. This process suggests that within the pores, water molecules can rapidly exchange between the cages without
adhering to each other or to the pore walls because the pores are very small. Due to the co-adsorption, H2O occupies
energetically favorable positions, which appear to be situated between the CO 2 molecules. Therefore, the
distinguishability between the phase transition and pore filling cannot be made with a reasonable precision. An
increased tendency for water molecules to form hydrogen bonds among themselves was observed at RH > 40% in
CALF-20 [19,20,22,26]. Consequently, more interconnected hydrogen-bond networks are formed involving a greater
number of H2O molecules. Formation of such water clusters is reflected by reduction of τcage to approximately 1.8
ns.
The presence of both CO2 and humidity leads to smaller, but distinct, changes in Icage than in pure water vapor
indicating that the micropores are permanently filled with the guests. Icage is lower than in the dry CO2 at 970 mbar
(0% RH)—due to less Ps formation because of changes in the chemistry of inner cage surface when water exist,
but it hardly changes with humidity up to ca. 70%. Above this pressure (at 10 3 mbar at 295 K in Fig. S6) it still
remains clearly above the humidified sample. This confirms our previous interpretation that water molecules are
initially well dispersed in the cages filled with CO2 and only start to cluster at high humidity.

Inter-grain spaces. In the presence of humidity together with CO2, τgrain behaves slightly different than in pure
water adsorption experiment. When humidity and CO2 coexist, τgrain starts changing already at 23% RH and
increases linearly with RH until stabilizing at ca. 90 ns between 75% and 98% RH (Fig. 5b). The transition differs
from pure humidity not only due to the wider RH range, but also the different slope in τgrain changes and much
greater value at high RH. It seems that the intergranular spaces are much larger at RH > 75 %. The increased
spaces may imply structural flexibility; however, the current results alone do not provide strong evidence to support
this. Alternatively, different interactions between the humid gas and the delocalized o-Ps migrating to intergranular
spaces may alter the ratio of o-Ps re-entering the cages. This results in fewer o-Ps annihilating with the cage
lifetime, while more o-Ps remain confined in the grain spaces, where they annihilate with longer lifetimes due to
the larger size of these spaces.
In humid CO2 adsorption, Igrain in Fig. 5d starts at a low level to decrease with increasing RH until 50%. This
decline may result from both hindered migration of o-Ps out of the cages and alterations in the surface chemistry
of the outer particle surfaces facing the grains. It remains greater than in the humid sample without CO2 at higher
RH. This again could mean that more o-Ps are being confined in intergranular spaces due to the humid gas, where
CO2 accumulating between the grains, as water preferentially fills the cages at high RH. This is supported by I grain
at RH > 70 % approaching its values observed in dry CO2. However, positronium formation may be affected by
other than geometrical factors, e.g. a high probability of Ps formation on the surface of water clusters or even near
to their surface (if Ps can migrate outside to the inter-grain spaces).

2.4. Variable temperature PXRD in the controlled atmospheres
To confirm the phase composition of the pristine sample at room temperature and under various temperatures and
gas atmospheres explored by PALS and CO₂ physisorption, PXRD patterns were collected for the CALF-20 sample (Appx. S6, Fig. S12), which was exposed to dry and humid nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases. All PXRD data
were analysed using Pawley method, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The first measurement, conducted on the
CALF-20 sample at 298 K in a dry nitrogen flow and prepared under ambient conditions, indicates the presence
of the pure CALF-20-β phase (Fig. 6i). Increasing the temperature to 320 K induces a phase transition from CALF20-β to CALF-20-α, primarily reflected by an expansion along the b-axis and simultaneous contractions along the
a- and c-axes. This finding is significant as it suggests that desorbing water and purging the CALF-20 cages require
minimal energy, in accordance to observations of Chapman et al. [20] in their helium flow experiments at room
temperature. At higher temperatures, only the CALF-20-α phase was maintained. These results also support the
PALS findings in Table 1, where the CALF-20-α phase was observed at T > RT. In the case of wet nitrogen flow,
only the CALF-20-α phase was observed across the entire temperature range ( Figure 6iii). Notably, the observed
variations in unit cell parameters are consistent with in silico data previously reported by Maurin et al. [51] When
exposed to dry CO₂, no phase transition was initiated, and the CALF-20-α phase was observed across the entire
temperature range (Fig. 6ii). Interestingly, wet CO₂ also did not induce a phase transition, even at 298 K, [51]
indicating strong host-guest interactions between CO₂ and the CALF-20-α phase ( Figure 6iv).
The data obtained provide essential insights into the behaviour of CALF-20 under various conditions, specifically:

3. Conclusions

This study provides comprehensive insights into the thermal effects on the porosity of CALF-20(Zn) under dry
and humid CO2 adsorption conditions, emphasizing the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and
guest interactions. In situ-PALS data reveal that o-Ps lifetimes in CALF-20 vary from 253 K to 373 K, with only
a modest 4% increase in cage size under vacuum, indicating that structural integrity is preserved for effective CO 2
adsorption.
The analysis shows a sigmoidal change in o-Ps lifetimes and intensities during CO2 adsorption, highlighting the
material's responsiveness to temperature and pressure variations. Notably, PALS results indicate the CO2
adsorption results in some empty spaces or gaps inside the CALF-20 cages, that are temperature- and pressure-

dependent. The correlation between PALS measurements and volumetric CO 2 adsorption confirms that CALF-20
exhibits Langmuir-type isotherms in the studied temperature range.
In humid environments, the competitive interactions between water and CO 2 significantly affect the course of
adsorption on CALF-20. Depending on the humidity, three clearly distinct states of the system can be observed:
dispersed water molecules, transition state, and water clustering. Above the transition, the formation of
interconnected water chains around the inner pore surfaces is observed, along with possibly enhanced structural
flexibility and larger inter-grain spaces filled with condensed water. When CO2 is introduced alongside humidity,
the size of adsorbate-free volumes in the cages initially decreases but stabilizes as hydrogen-bond networks form
among water molecules at high RH. This indicates competitive interactions for binding sites within CALF-20's
framework. Variable temperature PXRD confirms that CALF-20 transitions from β-phase to α-phase at elevated
temperatures (320 K and above), independent of gas or humidity conditions.
Overall, the integration of PALS, gas and water physisorption, and in situ PXRD analyses in this work elucidates
the fundamental mechanisms governing CO2 adsorption in CALF-20 while underscoring the importance of
environmental factors in optimizing its application for carbon capture technologies. Future research should focus
on long-term stability and performance under varied operational conditions to fully reveal CALF-20's potential.

4. Experimental Section/Methods

4.1. Materials
CALF-20 powder was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used in adsorption experiments, in situ-PXRD and in
situ PALS measurements after desolvation in dynamic vacuum for 10 h at 430 K.

4.2. Methods

4.2.1. PALS

Data collection and treatment: PALS measurements were conducted using a digital positron lifetime spectrometer
equipped with an Acqiris DC 282 digitizer (10-bit vertical resolution) and three photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
from SCIONIX HOLLAND coupled to CeBr3 scintillators. Two scintillators had dimensions of Ø=51 mm and
h=10 mm, while the third scintillator had Ø=51 mm and h=25.4 mm. The scintillators were deliberately positioned
to ensure comprehensive coverage around the sample holder and minimize the detection of backscattered photons,
which can distort PALS spectra due to high efficiency of scintillators. The PMTs were arranged with precision:
two were oriented horizontally at a 90° angle to each other, with their front faces separated by approximately 20
mm. The third PMT was vertically aligned, positioned above the sample holder. Customized data acquisition
software facilitated simultaneous detection of start and stop signals from each of the three PMTs. This capability
allowed for the collection of six spectra in a single measurement session, significantly reducing measurement time
compared to traditional two-tube spectrometers. The sample holder was designed specifically to accommodate
around 0.4 ml of powdered sample, surrounding a 20 µCi 22Na positron source sealed within a 5 µm Kapton foil
(DuPont). The coincidence box was set to a time range of 500 ns, while the PALS data acquisition software

operated with a 600 ns time window and a channel width of 5 ps. The PALS spectra were resolved by fitting
exponential decay curves to the histograms of recorded time differences, revealing lifetime components (τ n) with
their respective intensities (In). Analysis showed that a reliable fit, characterized by minimal residual and a χ2 value
of 1.03 – 1.08, was achieved only when considering four lifetime components. The resolved lifetime components
were categorized based on their lifetimes: τ1, corresponding to p-Ps annihilation (τ1 ~ 0.12 – 0.18 ns); τ2, originating
from unbound e+ annihilation (τ2 ~ 0.35 – 0.50 ns); and the longest-lived components representing o-Ps annihilation
within the pores (τ3 > 1 ns). It is believed that τ4 reflects o-Ps annihilation between crystals in the intergranular
spaces. These components are visualized in Fig. S2.
The numerical spectra analysis was conducted using the PALSFit routine, [42] which separates the spectra from
resolution functions, background, and source contribution. The conversion of the measured o-Ps lifetime to pore
sizes is done by the EELViS code,[52] which is based on the extended Tao-Eldrup model.[40] Al and Sn reference
samples with known lifetimes were employed to estimate the resolution functions and source contribution.
Approximately 10.6% source contribution (distributed between Kapton foil (0.382 ns / 10.4%) and glue (2.6 ns /
0.2%)) and an average time resolution of 0.28 ns (full width at half maximum) were determined during the fitting
process.

In situ PALS measurement methodologies: The utilized PALS setup coupled to a gas dosing system is detailed
elsewhere.[41] Whenever no pressure or temperature scanning is performed, the PALS measurements were
conducted in slices with a duration of 2 hours per slice (required to accumulate ~ 3 ×10 6 annihilation events) to
monitor the attainment of equilibrium conditions over the sample, such as humidity saturation, and to ensure
system stability over time. The results presented in this study represent the average of the slices, as indicated
below. The measurement sequence included:
(i)

Activation: The as-received sample underwent activation at 423 K in five slices (totaling 10 hours,
with 2 hours per slice) under dynamic vacuum of 1.5×10-6 mbar to remove any impurities absorbed
by the CALF-20 during sample transfer for PALS measurements. Subsequently, the sample was
cooled to room temperature (RT) and PALS spectrum was measured again over 2 hours. This RT
measurement serves as a reference for the initial pore state.

(ii)

Temperature-dependent measurements of empty pores. As mentioned in Section 2.1, PALS
measurements were performed under vacuum conditions (1.5 × 10 -6 mbar) over a temperature range
of 253 K to 373 K. The experimental procedure involved first activating the sample at 423 K for 10
hours, followed by a temperature program starting at 373 K and cooling to 253 K, with heating and
cooling rates of 2.5 K/min. Measurements were conducted at 2-hour intervals at each temperature
step during the temperature program.

(iii)

Dry CO2 adsorption: The dry CO2 adsorption experiments have been carried out at different
temperatures: 353 K, 323 K, 295 K, 273 K, and 253 K. At each T, the gas pressure was regulated by
the software and varied from 5 mbar to 1000 mbar during the adsorption cycle and then reversed
during the desorption cycle. The PALS measurements for each adsorption/desorption step were
conducted continuously for 2 hours at specific temperature and gas pressure conditions. After each

adsorption scan at a specific temperature, the sample was annealed at 473 K for 4 hours to purge the
pore for the subsequent step.

Humidity and humid CO2: Again, to thoroughly remove any residual CO2 in the pores from the
previous experiment, the sample underwent reactivation at 423 K for 4 hours. Following this, the
humidity experiments commenced at RT, consisting of two steps: first, exposing the sample to pure
humidity, and then subjecting it to humid CO2 conditions at 970 mbar CO2. Humidity levels were
adjusted using saturated salt solutions to achieve specific relative humidity (RH) levels of 11.3%,
22.5%, 34%, 43%, 51%, 63.5%, 75%, and 98% (water). At each RH value, the procedure involved
closing the valve to CO2 to establish pure humidity, removing the salt solution, heating the sample
under vacuum at 423 K for 4 hours to restore clean pores, reintroducing the salt solution, and
simultaneously opening the CO2 valve to initiate the humid CO2 experiment. Subsequently, the
sample was left exposed overnight to ensure saturated humidity over the sample. The measurement
then carried out by recording at least five slices, each lasting 2 hours, and the average of these slices
is presented as the result. Then, the activation procedure was repeated before the next step.

4.2.2. Volumetric adsorption measurements

Water vapor physisorption isotherms were measured using BELSORP-max apparatus (MICROTRAC MRB). A
water-filled thermostat combined with water bath (T = 298 K) was used to control the temperature. Helium gas
(purity 99.999%) was used for dead volume measurement. The conditions of 0.5% of pressure change within 450
s was assumed as adsorption equilibrium. Carbon dioxide physisorption isotherms were measured using
BELSORP-HP (MICROTRAC MRB), equipped with closed cycle helium cryostat and customized adsorption
cell. The dead volume was measured using helium gas (purity 99.999%) and carbon dioxide (purity 99.999%)
were used in adsorption experiments. The adsorption equilibration was defined as 1% of the pressure change within
450 s.

4.2.3. Variable temperature PXRD in controlled gas atmospheres
Powder diffraction patterns at variable temperatures were measured on PANALYTICAL Empyrean Powder Xray diffractometer (α-1 system, ω-2θ goniometer), equipped with Cu-Kα1 radiation (primary monochromator λ =
1.54059 Å), motorized antiscatter and receiving slits. A Pixcel 1D detector was used for the measurements of
reflection intensities. HTK-1200N high temperature chamber (ANTON PAAR) was used to control the sample
temperature. All measurements were conducted in a gas flow of 5 ml/min. PXRD patterns were collected in
reflection geometry using ω-2θ scans in the 2θ range from 3 to 70° with 0.013° steps and 120 s per step. The
sample was conditioned for 30 min after reaching the target temperature. The sample height correction program
for the measurements in the inert atmosphere was applied to correct the thermal expansion of the sample holder.
Nitrogen (purity 99.999 %) and carbon dioxide (purity 99.999%) were used in experiments. The gases were
humidified in a customized water-filled bubbler in order to achieve a saturated humidity level at 298 K.

CALF-20 is stable between 253 K and 373 K. CO2 adsorption on CALF-20 leaves gaps and shows higher CO2
uptake at T < RT and PALS reproduces the sorption isotherm. CO2 molecules are shifting from the cage centers
at high adsorption pressure. Water-loaded CALF-20 requires minimal energy for purging. CO2 remains selective
over H2O at low humidity, whereas at high humidity H-bonded H2O dominates.
