Fluorinated gases are used as refrigerants in many sectors. A transition to non-fluorinated
refrigerants has happened in many sectors already and offers tangible benefits in performance and
environmental impacts while taking increased need for safety measures into account.

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and so-called hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) are used as refrigerants in air
conditioning, refrigeration, chillers, heat pumps and devices for dehumidification and drying.
However, many HFCs, including R-134a and R-125, have a high global warming potential and some of
the HFCs and HFOs degrade atmospherically and form persistent degradation products. Thus, there is
an urgent need to replace fluorinated refrigerants with non-fluorinated working fluids to avoid direct
emissions due to leakage, incorrect loading or removal. It is important, however, also to select
refrigerants with high efficiencies to avoid indirect CO2 emissions due to a (too) high energy
consumption during the use phase. The present study investigates the available non-fluorinated
alternatives to fluorinated refrigerants and shows that a transition to non-fluorinated refrigerants, in
general, is possible and has happened in many sectors already. Technically, there are only slight
barriers to overcome to replace fluorinated refrigerants in almost all newly developed systems
conforming to existing standards. Additionally, we show that alternatives are available even for some
use cases for which derogations have been proposed in the PFAS restriction proposal and suggest
making these derogations more specific to support bringing the use of non-fluorinated refrigerants
into practice.

In 1985, the stratospheric ozone layer over Antarctica was found to be partially destroyed,1 and
strong regulatory action was taken in the following years to protect the ozone layer. In particular, the
most important step was the 1987 Montreal Protocol regulating ozone-depleting substances such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were used as refrigerants during this time.

The Montreal Protocol entered into force in January 1989. Following its implementation, CFCs used
in refrigeration and air conditioning systems were substituted with hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).2 HCFCs deplete stratospheric ozone, but to a much lesser
extent than CFCs, whereas HFCs have zero ozone depletion potential.3 In 1996, HCFCs were also
added as controlled substances to the Montreal Protocol and most companies in the refrigeration
and air conditioning sector switched to HFCs.2,4 Alternatives based on hydrocarbons such as propane
and butane were also developed. Due to charge limitation (below 150 g), in accordance to EN 378 for
unrestricted placement of equipment due to flammability, hydrocarbons were initially only applied in
domestic refrigerators in which they are now dominant all over the world. In other sectors, however,
because of concerns over their flammability and because they were not manufactured or controlled
by a refrigerant manufacturing company, hydrocarbons did not achieve a great market share in the
early days after Montreal Protocol.2,5 The United States (US) health and safety regulations even
prevented hydrocarbon refrigerators from entering the market.2,5

While HFCs do not deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, many have a high global warming potential
(GWP).6 The parties to the Montreal Protocol agreed, therefore, in 2016 to the Kigali Amendment to
gradually reduce the use of substances with high GWP depending on the sector, the refrigerant
charge, and year of implementation.7 The regulation of HFCs in the European Union (EU) started
even earlier with the European F-gas Regulation. The first version of the F-gas Regulation entered
into force in 2006.8 The third (and most current) version was adapted in February 2024.9 The aim of
the F-gas Regulation is to replace high-GWP F-gases with alternatives with a low GWP using a quota
system based on the total allowed annual sales of F-gases contributing to greenhouse gas emissions,
combined with a set of product bans. According to the European Environment Agency, the EU-wide
placing on the market of HFCs in 2022 was below the market limit set in the F-gas Regulation and
also below the maximum imposed by the Kigali Amendment.10

However, the substances proposed to replace HFCs – so-called hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) and even
the currently applied HFCs with lower GWP – might contribute to another potential environmental
problem. Several of the HFOs and HFCs can in part or completely be converted in the atmosphere
into trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).11 TFA is a persistent and mobile substance and the terminal
breakdown product of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Under the EU’s Regulation
on classification and labelling, TFA is classified as causing severe skin burns and eye damage (H314),
harmful if inhaled (H332), and harmful to aquatic life with long-lasting effects (H412).12 Germany
intends to additionally classify TFA as toxic if inhaled (H331) and as reproductive toxicant.13

76

TFA has been accumulating in the environment in many parts of the world for decades. For example,
TFA levels have increased in: surface water in Beijing, China 17-fold between 2002 and 2012;14 in
Arctic ice almost 10-fold between pre-1990 and post-2000,15 in precipitation in Germany 3- to 5-fold
between 1996/1997 and 2018/2020,11 in US surface waters 6-fold between 1998 and 2021,16 and in
leaves of various tree species in Germany between 1985 and 2022.11,17,18

Claims that the occurrence of TFA in the environment has mainly natural causes have been
disproved.19,20 Instead, evidence shows anthropogenic sources of TFA.11,21,22 Samples from older
German and Swiss groundwaters23,24 and pre-industrial samples from Greenland and Denmark20 did
not contain TFA and therefore support the anthropogenic origin of TFA. Recent data for TFA in rain
and snow in Switzerland,24,25 Japan,26 China,27 the US,28,29 Poland,30 the Netherlands,31 and

Germany21,32 show concentrations up to the µg/L-range. Some of these measured concentrations are
close to the revised groundwater/drinking water health guidance value of 60 μg/L TFA set by
Germany in 2020.21,33 The drinking water health guidance value is based on the life-long tolerable
daily intake of TFA, at which no harm to human health is to be expected, and was established
because of concerns about build-ups of TFA over time. Concentrations close to Germany’s health
guidance value for TFA in so many places of the world are an alarming signal and shows that
emissions need to be stopped.

If current sources of TFA are not curbed, concentrations will continue to increase, and the probability
of unforeseen effects will also increase.34 Undoing such effects will be very difficult, if possible at all
and will require huge efforts and costs, as e.g., TFA will not degrade in the environment and can also
not be removed from (waste)water with common water treatment methods, such as ozonation or
activated carbon filtration.11 These risks should be reduced by reducing or avoiding the use of the
refrigerants concerned at an early stage. Thus, the way forward has to be to regulate precursors of
TFA as soon as possible.

The third version of the European F-gas Regulation intends to tighten the action on fluorinated
refrigerants with high and mid-high GWP. HFOs and HFCs with low GWP that can form TFA, and
other persistent degradation products are not addressed. However, HFOs and HFCs that contain
a –CF2– or –CF3 unit (without any H/Cl/Br/I attached to it) are included in the PFAS restriction
proposal published by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in February 2023. 35 These include
R-1234yf, R-1234ze, and R-1233zd (Table 2). The aim of the restriction proposal is a comprehensive
ban of the uses of PFAS. Time-limited derogations are foreseen for those uses where alternatives are
currently not available. Some derogations are also proposed for fluorinated gases used as
refrigerants (Table 1). However, some industry producers are calling for even broader exemptions
and derogations based on the argument that fluorinated gases are ‘critical solutions’ and that there
are no alternatives ‘that deliver the same high level of performance’.36

The present study explores non-fluorinated alternatives for refrigerants and other heat transfer fluids
where fluorinated gases are still commonly used.11,37,38 The focus of the study is on uses in Europe,
but many of the alternatives discussed might also be available in other markets. We also discuss the

Fluorinated gases, here defined as all gases that contain a –CF3 or –CF2– moiety, are used in various
applications as refrigerants. Table 2 lists the fluorinated gases mentioned in the present study, along
with their 100-year GWP, and whether they are included in Annex I, II, or III of the current F-gas
Regulation.9 HFCs in Annex I are included in the quota system whereas the substances in Annex II and
III are not. Additionally, Table 3 lists the blends of fluorinated gases mentioned in the present study.
The HFCs in the blends (if listed in Annex I) are again part of the quota system. The European F-gas
Regulation uses the term ‘fluorinated greenhouse gases’ when referring to the substances listed in
Annex I, II or III of the Regulation or mixtures containing any of those substances. We will use this
term here when referring to the relevant parts of the F-gas Regulation; otherwise, the term
‘fluorinated gases’ will be used.

Table 2: Fluorinated gases mentioned in the present study. The 100-year GWP was taken from the third version
of the European F-gas Regulation,39 the percentages of TFA formation from Behringer et al. (2021).11 The values
for the HFCs for the 100-year GWP (GWP-100) in the third version of the European F-gas Regulation are from
the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and are lower than the
values for the 100-year GWP from the sixth assessment report of the IPCC.40 These outdated (and lower) values
were kept here to be in line with the F-gas Regulation and the thresholds set there.

With the substances listed in Table 2 and 3, we see two main problems. First, some of the fluorinated
gases have very high GWPs. R-23, R-125, R-134, R134a, R143a and R-245fa have a GWP that is more
than 1000 times higher than that of CO2. R-32 and R-152a have a lower GWP, but it is still more than
100 times higher than that of CO2. The high GWP of these substances is addressed in the F-gas
Regulation and a phase-out has been started. So, there is a need to find alternatives here. Second,
several of the fluorinated gases form TFA as persistent degradation product. As described before,
TFA is accumulating in the environment and cannot be removed from water with common treatment
methods. TFA will be addressed in the PFAS restriction proposal but for this it is important to show
that non-fluorinated alternatives can be used as refrigerants in the long term.

There are different non-fluorinated gases available that can be applied as refrigerants depending on
their required temperature levels and thermal capacities of the systems. Examples include propane
(R-290), (iso)butane (R-600a), ammonia (R-717), water (R-718), CO2 (R-744), other hydrocarbons as
well as helium and nitrogen. The non-fluorinated refrigerants cover the entire temperature range
that is needed in the different applications, although none of them covers the range alone. This is
very similar to the fluorinated refrigerants where also not a single refrigerant covers the entire range
(Figure 1). Very important is also the refrigerant-dependent compressor efficiency. It has been shown
e.g., that the largest share of the emissions in CO2-equivalent during the life-cycle of a heat pump is
due to indirect emissions caused by the electricity consumption during the heat pump use phase.41,42
The direct emissions of the refrigerant in CO2 equivalents during refrigerant production and
refrigerant leakage are small compared to emissions during the heat pump use phase. To keep the
indirect emissions low, the refrigerant-dependent system energy efficiency (expressed as the
seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP)) needs to be high. The SCOP can vary based on the
investigated refrigerant cycle configurations.41 Importantly, based on measured data for air-to-water
heat pumps, it has been shown that the non-fluorinated refrigerants have similar if not even higher
SCOP values than fluorinated refrigerants. The measured SCOP values reported in Vering et al.
(2023)42 were 4.2, 4.19, 3.81 and 4.27 for propane, propene, (iso)-butane and ammonia and 3.71,
3.99 and 3.82 for R-410A, R-32 and R-1234yf, respectively.

Non-fluorinated gases used as refrigerants

Energy efficient utilization of CO2 as working fluid in refrigeration units is possible when hot water is
produced enabling a large water temperature lift from below 10 °C to above 80 °C. For central
refrigeration systems in commercial stores it has been shown that systems with CO2 can be operated

more energy efficiently than direct HFC/CO2 cascade and HFC systems.43–45 Based on these results, it
can be stated that non-fluorinated refrigerants can be used energy-efficiently for applications in a
wide temperature range.

Therefore, when selected carefully for an appropriate application, non-fluorinated refrigerants can
replace fluorinated refrigerants in many applications. SI Section S2 contains a detailed description of
the mentioned non-fluorinated refrigerants. Table 4 gives a short overview of the most important
non-fluorinated refrigerants, their thermodynamic properties, advantages, and disadvantages.

A simple refrigerant cycle includes the phases of compression, condensation, expansion, and
evaporation (SI Section S3.1). The selection of the most suitable refrigerant that undergoes these
phases is complex because chemical, ecological, and thermodynamic properties must be
balanced.42,53 SI Section S3.2 provides criteria for the selection of refrigerants that address safety,
carbon footprint, and some thermodynamic properties. In most cases, more than one refrigerant can
be used in a technical application. Below, available products and brands are listed that use nonfluorinated gases as refrigerants. The uses and sub-uses are also summarized in Figure 2. The
intention is to show that alternatives are already available and on the market. However, the listings
may not be complete, and more energy-efficient, less expensive, or systems with higher capacities
may exist.

Refrigeration systems remove heat from a refrigerated cabinet or room via the evaporator by
transferring the heat to the ambient air outside through the condenser. Air is used as the secondary
fluid for both heat exchangers. Various refrigeration systems are on the market. In analogy to the
current F-gas Regulation, they are divided here into domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration
(stand-alone systems and multipack centralized systems), industrial refrigeration, transport
refrigeration of goods, and ultra-low and low temperature freezers. Table 5 gives an overview of the
non-fluorinated refrigerants used in the different sub-uses of refrigeration. A more detailed

4.1.1 Domestic refrigeration
Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: After January 2015, new domestic
refrigerators and freezers in the EU should not contain HFCs with a GWP ≥ 150.39 An estimated 95%
of all fridges in Europe now use iso-butane; nevertheless, some American-style refrigerators supplied
to the EU market still operate with hydrofluorocarbons.11,54 Fluorinated greenhouse gases will not be
permitted anymore in new domestic refrigerators and freezers from January 2026 on, except if
required to meet safety requirements.9

EU, and the entire segment will soon apply only non-fluorinated working fluids.

245

Non-fluorinated alternatives: A number of different non-fluorinated refrigerants are available
including hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, propene or isobutane, but also ammonia and CO2.43
Propane is used most often in stand-alone refrigeration systems in smaller shops and
supermarkets.54 EIA (2021)55 lists specific products that are commercially available.

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Historically, these systems have used R-134a
and R-404A. Since January 2022, HFCs with a GWP ≥ 150 are no longer allowed in the EU in
refrigerators and freezers for commercial use.9 From January 2025 on, fluorinated greenhouse gases
in general with a GWP ≥ 150 will not be allowed any more in this application.9

(i) Centralized systems. Systems using CO2 as refrigerant in transcritical cycles have become a
standard technology across Europe.43 In these systems, CO2 is typically applied for direct evaporation,
so no extra water or glycol loops are needed. The number of installed CO2 units exceeded 35,000 in
2021, 29,000 in Europe.54 The systems available today can achieve high annual energy efficiencies
even when located in warmer-climate sites; they can be operated even more energy efficient than
direct HFC/CO2 cascade and HFC systems.43–45 Also, the leakage rates of transcritical CO2 systems is
on the same order as conventional HFC systems.43 The upfront investment costs for transcritical CO2
systems working in warmer climates were higher than for conventional systems in the past.43
However, this has changed and today the total cost of ownership is lower for well-designed
transcritical CO2 systems in these regions.57

(ii) Indirect centralized systems. Indirect systems include a number of cascading systems where two
or more refrigerant cycles are connected in series so that the absorbed heat is transferred from one
cycle to another.43 Indirect systems can therefore combine e.g., the use of CO2, glycol or other heattransferring fluids inside a store to cool the display cabinets and freezers with refrigerants such as
hydrocarbons or ammonia in the outer machine room loop (the “primary refrigerant cycle”).43
Systems with ammonia/CO2 cascades are used in some large stores in warmer climates as they yield
good energy efficiencies under these conditions.43 Systems with propane and glycol loops have been
installed by a number of retailers across Europe for example, in Germany, UK, Belgium and
Switzerland.56 However, glycol loops require a lower evaporation temperature in the refrigeration
system, as the heat from the cabinets must be absorbed by the glycol mixture and then removed by
the refrigeration system. Also, the glycol mixture must be pumped. Compared to a direct evaporation
system of e.g., CO2 in the cabinets, the total energy consumption is higher in systems with glycol

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Since January 2022, fluorinated greenhouse
gases with a GWP ≥ 150 that are listed in Annex I of the current F-gas Regulation9 have not been
allowed in the EU in multipack centralized refrigeration systems for commercial use with a rated
capacity of more than 40 kW. Exempted are gases for the primary refrigerant circuit of cascade
systems where fluorinated greenhouse gases with a GWP of less than 1,500 may be used.9 In 2016,
the majority of newly installed commercial refrigeration systems in the EU were still based on R134a, followed by CO2.56

loops. The additional required temperature difference (5 K) and the demanded superheat (5-10 K)
significantly reduces the suction pressure of the indirect units. However, the temperature
requirements inside the display cabinets are different across Europe; in some countries 8 °C is
acceptable, while others require at maximum 4 °C. This has a significant impact on the technology to
be utilized. Manufacturer that offer those systems in Europe include Carel,58 Epta,59 and Freor.60

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Since 1850, ammonia refrigeration systems have been the most
energy-efficient systems and are therefore applied in large cooling facilities in the food processing
industry e.g., in the fish processing industry, in meat processing plants, slaughterhouses in general,
breweries and dairies as well as in the process cooling in the chemical industry.54,62,63 Cascade
systems using ammonia and CO2 are also widely used on board ships and for warehouses and
industrial refrigeration.54,64 With this system configuration the refrigerant charge of the ammonia can
be significantly reduced and only the CO2 is distributed within the building or process. In case of CO2
leakages, the cooled and frozen products can be secured, which is an advantage over systems using
ammonia only. Systems applying entirely CO2 have also been developed and have proven to be
viable.45,65–67 Additional systems with non-fluorinated gases as refrigerants are listed in EIA (2021).55

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulation: Ammonia has been widely used for many years
in large industrial refrigeration systems.61 In small industrial systems, R-404A and R-134a were also in
use.61 However, since January 2020, HFCs with a GWP ≥ 2500 are not allowed anymore in
refrigeration equipment except equipment intended for application designed to cool products to
temperatures below – 50 °C. The F-gas Regulation will be tightened again for refrigerant equipment
(except chillers) in 2025 and 2030, so that fluorinated greenhouse gases with GWPs above 2500 and
150, respectively will no longer be permitted. Chillers are regulated separately, see below (Section
4.2).

Non-fluorinated alternatives: i) For trucks, a roof-mounted refrigeration unit has been developed by
the German company ECOOLTEC that applies propene and CO2.70 Propene is used inside the active
outdoor refrigeration loop, while the air inside the cargo compartment is either heated or cooled by
CO2. The cargo-air/CO2 heat exchanger is operated indirectly by the heat pipe principle, whereby CO2
is utilized as the working fluid between the cargo and the refrigeration unit.

315
316

ii) Refrigeration trailers that use CO2 for the industrial, commercial and public sector are offered by
Greencold.71

317
318

iii) The Austrian company PBX has tested a propane-based refrigeration unit, called M24, for light
commercial electrical vehicles.72

319
320

iv) Container refrigeration systems applying CO2 as working fluid have been on the market since
2010.73 The NaturaLINE® unit was the world’s first natural refrigerant container technology.

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulation: The majority of trucks and trailers today use R404A.61 R-452A, R-410A and R-143a are also often used as refrigerants in the transport sector.11,68,69
As transport refrigeration does not fall under any of the sectors in Annex IV of the current F-gas
Regulation, no specific GWP limits apply. However, the refrigerants fall under quota system, so there
is still some pressure to move to low GWP alternatives.

Non-fluorinated alternatives: For evaporation temperatures down to −45°C, propene (R-1270) is
preferred.54 Some manufacturers also prefer propene for applications with higher temperature levels
as it can be used together with smaller and less expensive compressors.54 For low-temperature
applications with freezing temperatures down to about –80 °C, ethane can be utilized. When ethane
is used in cascade systems with propane, better energy efficiencies are achieved than with systems
using R-23 and other HFCs.54 In special cases where the required temperature needs to be below –80
°C, ethene, helium, nitrogen or methane can be applied.54 Available systems on the market include,
e.g., ultra-low freezer (−86 °C to −40 °C) from Tecnomara that use a cascade system of propane (first
level) and a mixture of propane and ethane (second level),77 and ultra-low temperature freezers with
propane from Liebherr.78 Other manufacturer that offer ultra-low temperature freezers with
hydrocarbons as refrigerants include Meling,79,80 VWR,81 and Carlo Erba Reagents.82 Cryogenic ultralow temperature freezers with hydrocarbons are also on the market, e.g., from PHCBI,83 Haiers
Biomedical,84 and Linde.85

345

347

The Odense University Hospital in Denmark inaugurated a cold-storage room with –80 °C for storing
tissue samples in 2012. The refrigeration system is built as an indirect cascade system using ethane
and ammonia.86

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Fluorinated gases are frequently used in ultralow temperature freezers or cryogenic storage35,74 as well as in centrifuges and test systems.75,76
There is currently no prohibitions for the use of HCFs or other fluorinated gases for equipment
intended for application designed to cool products to temperatures below 50 °C. This will change
from January 2030 on when fluorinated greenhouse gases with a GWP ≥ 150 are not allowed
anymore in refrigerant equipment, except if required to meet safety requirements at the site of
operation.

4.2.1 Heat pumps in building energy systems

360
361
362

(i) Air-source heat pumps: 80% of the air-water heat pumps globally sold in 2019 contained R-410A.87
R-134a was the second-most common refrigerant. The other two main refrigerants in use were R-32
and propane.87

363
364
365
366

(ii) Ground heat pumps: 35% of the ground heat pumps installations in 2018 in Germany contained R410A, 20% R-407C and another 20% R-32.87 Ground heat pumps with R-134a were not installed
anymore, although they had a small market share before 2018. As of 2018, 7% of the installed
ground heat pumps contained propane.87

367
368
369
370

The current version of the F-gas Regulation includes placing on the market prohibitions for various
heat-pump equipment. Differences are made between self-contained and split units as well as
between large (rated capacity between 12 kW and 50 kW) and small (rated capacity below or equal
12 kW) heat pumps (Figure 3).

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations:

Figure 3: Placing on the market prohibitions from Annex IV of the F-gas Regulation9 that refer to self-contained air

part). The blue squares indicate systems with a rated capacity ≥ 12 kW.

375
376
377
378

The proposed prohibitions will lead – within the next 5 to 10 years – to a decrease of the number of
permitted fluorinated refrigerants in the heat pump sector. From the above-mentioned fluorinated
refrigerants, only R-1234ze will be permitted if the limit is down to a GWP of 150.

(i) A variety of air-source heat pumps with non-fluorinated refrigerants are available. Monobloc heat
pumps have been developed with propane as refrigerant e.g., by Viessmann, Rhoss, Vaillant,
Mitsubishi, Advansor and others.88–92 A split heat pump with a rated capacity of up to 16 kW utilizing
propane has just recently been introduced to the market by Haier.93 Larger systems with propane are
not (yet) on the market, mainly due to safety concerns as split systems require the refrigerant to be
transported inside the building. Suitable measures must be taken to safeguard the technical system.
Additionally, when compact heat exchanger technology is employed on the condenser side, the total
refrigerant charge can be significantly reduced, and it will also be possible to introduce split heat
pumps with higher rated capacities. The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany is
for example already working on developing low-charge propane heat pumps for multi-family
housing.94

392
393
394
395
396
397

Split heat pumps have also been developed with CO2 and are widely in use in industrial applications
as well as in residential water heaters in countries such as Japan and Australia.95 CO2 has become the
new norm for domestic hot-water heat pumps in Japan, where more than 5 million heat pumps with
CO2 are already installed to produce hot water for apartments.54 The Swiss army also applies CO2
heat pumps for facility heating and the production of hot tap water in a training hall.96 Stiebel Eltron
offers also an air-air heat pump with CO2 as refrigerant.97 In countries where the required hot-water
storage temperature is above 70 °C, CO2 heat pumps are the preferred option, as water supply
temperatures above 80 °C can be achieved without any auxiliary device.

400
401
402
403

(ii) Ground-source heat pumps with non-fluorinated refrigerants are also available. Examples are the
“ecoGEO 1-6 PRO” heat pump from Ecoforest,98 the sole-water heat pump from HEIM AG99 or the
SNTM3-10 heat pump from Heliotherm,100 which all use propane as refrigerant. Additional providers
are HAUTEC,101 Regli,102 or Secon.103 Systems with CO2, ammonia, and water are also available.104,105

404
405
406
407
408

iii) Water-source heat pumps with non-fluorinated refrigerants are also available. For example, the
Norwegian heat pump manufacturer, Tequs, has launched a CO2 water-to-water heat pump for the
European market just recently that can provide domestic hot water, space heating and cooling for a
variety of applications.106 Enerblue is also offering a water-source heat pump with a rated capacity of
up to 87 kW with propane as refrigerant.107

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Heat pumps with CO2 have been installed in district heating networks in
Denmark.54 Those heat pumps are particularly appropriate where the district heating is relatively well
developed and also where the district heating temperatures (both supply and return) are relatively
low (around 40 °C).54 Systems are offered for example by FENAGY.109 Ammonia is used as working
fluid in heat pumps for district heating systems up to a supply temperature of about 90 °C.54,108
Examples are district heating networks in Lemgo in Germany,110 Malmö in Sweden,111 and Lausanne,
Aarau, and Rheinfelden Mitte in Switzerland.96

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: R-134a was present in more than 90% of the
installed capacity in EU28, Norway and Switzerland in 2017.108 Other district heating networks use R152a, R-245fa, R-1234ze or non-fluorinated refrigerants.96,108

Plug-in room air-conditioning
Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Since January 2020, the EU only allows HFCs in
movable room air-conditioning equipment if their GWP is below 150.6 Therefore, mainly systems
with propane are currently entering the market. From January 2032 onwards, fluorinated
greenhouse gases will no longer be allowed in self-contained air-conditioning equipment (Figure 3).

432
433
434

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Propane has already been frequently used in moveable air conditioners
by Asian and European equipment producers for a number of years and is widely available on the
European market.113

Currently only a few percent of European residential and commercial buildings have air conditioning
systems installed. However, the annual sales in 2016 were around 12 million units and thus still
represent an important market. Due to increasing demands on air quality and thermal comfort, the
number of buildings with air conditioning will continue to rise.112

Stationary single and multiple split air conditioning
Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: In single-split systems with less than 3 kg of
refrigerant, R-32 has mostly replaced R-410A.113 R-410A has a GWP of 2088 and will therefore no
longer be allowed in the EU in single-split air conditioning systems with less than 3 kg of fluorinated
greenhouse gases from January 2025 on, while R-32 will still be allowed.9 However, the use of
fluorinated greenhouse gases with GWP ≥ 150 will be prohibited in systems with a rated capacity up
to and including 12 kW from January 2027 (split air-to-water), January 2029 (split air-to-air) and
January 2035 on (split systems in general) except if required to meet safety requirements at the site
of operation (Figure 3).9 Thus, R-32 will also not be permitted in those systems in the future.

445
446
447
448
449

R-410A is still the dominant refrigerant for larger air conditioning systems placed on the market in
the EU today.11,113 However, for split systems with a rated capacity above 12 kW, fluorinated
greenhouse gases with a GWP ≥ 750 will be prohibited from January 2029 on, fluorinated greenhouse
gases with a GWP ≥ 150 from January 2033 on, respectively. A changeover is therefore also necessary
in this market segment, which may also extend to the use of alternative systems.

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Since 2012, propane has been used in commercially-available split air
conditioners with cooling capacities up to 7 kW by some Chinese and Indian manufacturers.113,114
China reportedly produced 160,000 split-type room air conditioners with propane until 2019.115
Single-split air conditioners with propane are now also available in Europe, e.g., by ElectrIQ,114 or
Midea.116 It has been demonstrated that the energy efficiency and cooling capacity of split units with
propane compares favorably to conventional refrigerants, including in warm climates.113,117
Additionally, Daikin has developed and introduced multi-split air conditioning (VRV) systems applying
CO2 for commercial buildings.118 As refrigerant-carrying pipes have to be routed through the rooms in
a building, special safety measures are required that may not be implemented with reasonable
technical effort. Alternative solutions that can meet the same requirements must therefore be
considered.

A possible replacement for these systems are hydraulic systems that are connected to a refrigeration
system. The heat can then be removed via chilled ceilings, cooling sails, fan coils or induction
systems.55 Large propane chillers for industrial applications are readily available in Europe although
their energy demand is somewhat higher than the demand of air conditioning systems.35 Chillers
using ammonia, CO2 or other non-fluorinated refrigerants are also available (see Section 4.3). Chillers
can also be used for district cooling, as done for example in Copenhagen.119 Across Europe less than

Mobile air conditioning in vehicles on the ground
Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: The EU Directive 2006/40/EC on mobile airconditioning systems (MAC Directive) has prohibited the use of R-134a in new passenger cars and
light commercial vehicles since 2017. The main substitute for mobile air conditioning in passenger
cars and light commercial vehicles is R-1234yf.

476
477
478
479
480

For mobile air-conditioning systems in buses, commercial vehicles of weight classes N3, N2 and partly
N1, such as agricultural machinery, ships, rail vehicles, medium-sized aircraft and helicopters, a
phase-down of HFCs is not yet required by law. However, the HFCs used in the mobile airconditioning systems fall under the quota system of the current F-gas Regulation.9 The most common
used refrigerants in buses and trains for air conditioning systems are R-134a and R-407C.

Non-fluorinated alternatives: i) CO2 is increasingly applied in fully electrified vehicles due to its good
performance when used in reversible heat pumps.121,122 One advantage compared to R-1234yf is that
CO2 heat pumps supply more heat at temperatures below –5 °C than systems with R-1234yf where
electric heating is needed below –5 °C. CO2 is currently also used by some car manufacturers for cars
with combustion engines e.g., by Mercedes and VW.123,124

486
487

489

ii) CO2 is also used by several bus manufacturers. As an example, Konvekta has supplied CO2 air
conditioning systems since 2008.125 Other CO2 air conditioning systems are available from Daimler,
Panasonic, Bitzer, Valeo, Bock126 and Solaris.127 A roof heat pump system based on propane is
available from HeaVac-Aurora.126

iii) CO2 has also been tested for long-distance passenger trains and a recent project showed an
energy efficiency improvement compared to the conventional system of 30%.128 Elbel (2022)129
demonstrated how to implement a CO2 air conditioning system for high-speed trains. A fully
functional prototype CO2 unit was built for demonstration and evaluation. The energy efficiency and
cooling capacity were 16% and 14% higher, respectively, compared to the baseline R-407C system.

iv) Another alternative for passenger trains is air-conditioning with an air-cycle system.130 A recent
project conducted in Germany over 2 years on an Intercity Express 3 (ICE3) in standard passenger
service provided average savings of 28% in the primary annual energy consumption compared to a
systems using R-134a.130 Additionally, the company Wabtec developed and implemented a propanebased air conditioning system including a safety concept for passenger trains.131

Mobile air conditioning in aircrafts
Currently used refrigerants: Air-cycle air conditioning systems use air as working fluid. The most
commonly used refrigerant in vapor-compression cycle systems is R-134a.132,133

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Efforts have been made to substitute R-134a with CO2 as refrigerant.132
In such systems, CO2 is operated in a transcritical cycle.134

Non-fluorinated alternatives: CO2-based cooling is becoming more common in data centers.136 An
example is a data center in Valencia, Spain that provides cooling capacity for the servers and the data
center’s air-conditioning. Waste heat produced by the data center’s cooling equipment is recovered
and sold to the local district heating system for use in nearby buildings.137 There are also data centers
that use ammonia chiller, for example the one in Ostermiething, Austria.138 Chillers that use water as
refrigerant have also been developed for data centers by the company Efficient Energy.139 The
patents and technology of Efficient Energy are now owned by Vertiv.140

524

The current and upcoming prohibitions in the F-gas Regulation for chillers are shown in Figure 4.

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: For low-pressure refrigerant chillers, R-123
was used in the past as well as R-245fa.141 More recently, R-1233zd and R-514A are used.141 In
medium-pressure chillers, R-134a has dominated since it was introduced in the early 1990s. R-513A
and R-1234ze are also in use.141 R-410A has been mainly used in the past in high-pressure chillers.141
Alternatives in use are R-454B and R-32. Systems with propane and ammonia are also on the market.

Non-fluorinated alternatives: A report from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy describes the use of
four industrial heat pumps that use ammonia as refrigerant and one that uses CO2 as refrigerant.96 All
five heat pumps have a capacity between 480 and 1000 kW. Additional examples for the use of
ammonia and CO2 are given in IEA (2020)46 and on the IEA website under “Case studies”.145 A recent
example is also the use of ammonia as refrigerant in a heat pump to reduce energy consumption
from steam generation.146 A high-temperature heat pump unit with propane and butane has been
developed and manufactured by a local vendor in Norway. It is implemented in the process plant and
the novel heat pump simultaneously produces ice-water and process-heat for a Norwegian dairy.147

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Industrial heat pumps in Switzerland use
various refrigerants including R-134a, R-1234ze, R-245fa, R-410A, ammonia and CO2.96 R-410A and
CO2 were the most often used refrigerants in industrial heat pumps in Japan as of 2020, followed by
R-134a and other fluorinated refrigerants.46 For the EU, the prohibitions for placing on the market
that have been described above for heat pumps in building energy systems also apply for heat pumps
in industrial energy systems. This means that for self-contained heat pumps no fluorinated
greenhouse gases are permitted from January 2030 onwards. For split systems with a rated capacity
above 12 kW, fluorinated greenhouse gases with a GWP ≥ 750 are prohibited from January 2029
onwards, fluorinated greenhouse gases with a GWP ≥ 150 from January 2033 onwards, respectively.
This means that a system shift is also required here.

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Several European manufacturers of HPTD apply propane as the main
working fluid in their latest models.148

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: The most commonly used refrigerants in
HPTDs globally are R-134a, R-407C, and R-410A. Some transition to propane has happened in EU
parties.61 Refrigerants in HPTD are not regulated in the EU so far.

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Many refrigerant air dryers use R-410a,
however air dryers with propane are also available. After January 2024, new refrigerant air dryers for
laundry quantities of up to 20 kg should not contain refrigerants with a GWP ≥ 1800 in Switzerland.149
Mobile dehumidifiers with maximum dehumidification rates up to 30 liters in 24 hours should not
contain stable refrigerants in Switzerland from January 2024 on.149 There are no product-specific
regulations in the EU.

Non-fluorinated alternatives: Ammonia is one of the most common refrigerants used in ice rinks in
North America153 and according to a Canadian study, it shows superior energy performance
compared to a R-513A system.153 Transcritical CO2 systems have also been used and have the
advantage that surplus heat can be recovered simply and used for heating applications.153,154 Direct
expansion of the CO2 below the ice is also applied, especially in rinks focusing to achieve the most
uniform ice surface temperature at the highest possible evaporation temperature. Such uniform ice
temperature is not achievable with secondary loop systems based on sensible heat with a certain
temperature difference across the individual loops.155 It has also been stated that CO2 is more
energy-effective than fluorinated gases if the whole year (and not just the hottest hours of the year)
is considered.156

Currently used refrigerants and upcoming regulations: Historically, more than 95% of the ice rinks in
Europe have used ammonia; very few rinks used fluorinated refrigerants.153 There are now also 80
rinks that utilize CO2, mostly in Northern Europe and some in Switzerland.153 About three-quarters
use indirect CO2 systems where CO2 is used in the machine room along with a secondary refrigerant.
The other quarter uses CO2 as primary refrigerant.153 However, half of the ice rinks in the US use a
fluorinated gas, mostly R-22.153 Refrigerants in ice rinks are not regulated in the EU so far.

Importance of the transition to non-fluorinated refrigerants

610
611

613

615

70% of the EU bulk supply of fluorinated gases (Figure 5b) and 90% of the fluorinated gas emissions
in the EU are HFCs10 and many of the HFCs are included in Annex I of the current F-gas Regulation
and are subject to the quota system. However, unsaturated HFCs and HCFCs such as R-1234yf (GWP
0.5) or R-1234ze (GWP 1.37) are not covered by the quota system and are used as alternatives to
HFCs with a higher GWP. Reducing their emissions is also important, because (ii) certain of these
fluorinated gases form TFA.

Refrigeration, air conditioning, heating, and other uses of heat-transfer fluids make up 75% of all uses
by mass of F-gases (Figure 5a),10 and a significant increase in the demand for refrigerants is expected
due to the heat pump boom and increased comfort requirements for air conditioning in the next
years.157 The use categories investigated above are therefore important areas for reducing the use of
F-gases. This is significant for two reasons: (i) F-gases represented 2.5% of the total EU greenhousegas emissions in 20239 and reducing their direct emissions is an important element in efforts against
global warming158,159 However, it is also important to note that these emissions are lower than the
indirect CO2 emissions that originate from the energy consumption during the operation of the
refrigerant systems. Replacing the fluorinated refrigerants with non-fluorinated refrigerants that are
at least as efficient as the fluorinated ones is therefore indispensable.

In addition to the emissions from the fluorinated gases themselves, it has also been shown that
atmospheric abundances and emissions of five CFCs (CFC-13, -112a, -113a, -114a and -115) increased
between 2010 and 2020.160 In terms of impact on climate, the emissions of these five CFCs estimated
for 2020 are equivalent to 47 ± 5 Tg CO2 equivalent year−1, which is the same amount as the 2020 CO2
emissions of Switzerland.161 These five CFCs are allowed under the Montreal Protocol in the
production of other chemicals. Previous work has linked emissions of CFC-113a and CFC-115 to the
production of R-125.162–165 CFC-113a and CFC-114a are intermediates in a production pathway of R134a. Replacing R-134a and R-125 with non-fluorinated refrigerants in air conditioners and other
refrigerant applications would therefore very likely also reduce these highly problematic CFC
emissions.

Availability of alternatives

652

Looking at the proposed derogation in the PFAS restriction proposal (Table 1), we argue that the
proposed derogations for 1) refrigerants in transport refrigeration other than in marine applications
and 2) refrigerants in low temperature refrigeration below −50 °C could be made more specific
because alternatives for many of the sub-uses are already on the market. Refrigerants for mobile air
conditioning systems in combustion-engine vehicles with mechanical compressors are also available.
However, as new vehicles with combustion engines will no longer be allowed in the EU from 2035 on
(except if they run with e-fuels), a derogation of 6.5 years (or even 13.5 years) seems acceptable
(given that the PFAS restriction will likely not enter into force before 2026).

Section 4) has shown that non-fluorinated refrigerants are available for all but a few refrigerant
applications. Water-based solutions can also be used for the wide range of applications for split
appliances. A transition away from fluorinated refrigerants may require some time but is certainly
possible. Academic scientists working on heat pump equipment stated in 2023 that a transition time
of 3–8 years to propane for indoor heat pumps (which is currently one of the applications where the
use of propane is still challenging) seems to be realistic, depending on the different applications and
capacity ranges.166 It is therefore important to make an early announcement of clear and ambitious
phase-out dates of fluorinated gases used as refrigerants taking different development time spans
for different product classes and application areas into account. While simultaneously safety
measures are gaining importance, the development time spans have to be reasonably defined so that
products come to the market that ensure less harmful impact to the environment, efficient, and safe
operation.

However, other systems that use non-fluorinated refrigerants might also be more expensive than
systems with fluorinated refrigerants.167 There are two main points that are important to consider
here. First, market prices will decrease if the number of produced units increases. So, it can be
expected that systems with non-fluorinated refrigerants will become cheaper if their market share
increases.168 And second, it might be (substantially) cheaper for society to find alternatives to
fluorinated gases than to pay the costs of cleaning up the drinking water and dealing with health
effects due to the exposure to high levels of persistent fluorinated substances. A study from
Minnesota in the United States showed that costs to remove PFAS from waste water are between
$14 and $28 billion over 20 years in Minnesota alone.169,170 It is hence important that the fluorinated
refrigerants will be replaced with non-fluorinated refrigerants that operate at the same or even
higher efficiency as the operation costs can easily exceed the investment costs. Also, one
environmental problem should not be solved at the expense of another, so having efficient systems
will also help to fight global warming. The safety concept for flammable refrigerants should also be
critically examined with regard to the areas of application. Specifically, the normative specification of
sufficiently safe concepts for different performance classes should be revised.171 If the revision is
done in a sensible way, lower costs for these solutions can also be expected.

There are already systems on the market where the use of non-fluorinated refrigerants is overall
more cost-effective than the use of fluorinated refrigerants. For example, it has been shown that the
life-cycle costs of an ice rink including initial capital costs, maintenance costs, operating costs, and
the asset's residual value at the end of its life are lower when non-fluorinated refrigerants are used
compared to fluorinated refrigerants.156

Barriers posed by codes and standards

693
694
695
696

The product standard IEC EN 60335-2-89 was updated in 2019 and the charge limits for flammable
(A3) refrigerants such as propane were increased from 150 g to 500 g in self-contained commercial
refrigeration cabinets. The charge limits for low-flammable refrigerants (A2 and A2L) were increased
to 1200 g.175

The report from the European Commission on barriers posed by codes, standards and legislation to
using climate-friendly technologies in the refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pump and foam sectors
found in 2016 that standards at the international, European, and national level are an important
barrier for the use of hydrocarbons.172 The most relevant European standards for refrigeration, air
conditioning, and heat pumps are EN 378, the product standard IEC EN 60335-2-40 for airconditioning systems, and the product standard IEC EN 60335-2-89 for integral and remote
commercial refrigeration applications.173 The product standards take precedence over EN 378 if they
are implemented in a national regulation. The revision of EN 378 in 2017 introduced a new
flammability category (2L) that allows higher maximum charges for HFCs and HFOs and permits the
use of these substances in a larger range of applications and locations.172 However, hydrocarbons do
not fall under category 2L and, thus, the charge size below which no additional protective measures
are required is still very small, in particular for use in air conditioning and geothermal heat pumps.172
EN 378 is currently again subject to review. The focus of the new revision is the broader use of
flammable refrigerants, particularly for equipment not explicitly covered through product standards.
However, the process is not expected to be completed before 2024.174

Work on the product standard IEC EN 60335-2-40 that is relevant for split air conditioning and heatpump systems has also been undertaken. The revised standard allows for using a larger charge of
flammable refrigerants (up to 988 g of propane in a standard split air conditioning system) in new
equipment designed according to certain additional safety requirements to ensure the same high
level of safety as equipment using non-flammable refrigerants.176 However, the standard still needs
to be adopted in the individual countries.

A transition to non-fluorinated refrigerants is possible and has happened in many sectors already.
Technically, there are only slight barriers to overcome to replace fluorinated refrigerants in almost all
newly developed systems conforming to existing standards. In some cases, trade-offs must be
accepted in terms of initial costs, operating pressure, and/or capacity; however, compared to the
improved environmental compatibility of the non-fluorinated alternatives, these trade-offs are worth
making and have a reasonable payback due to reduced operational expenses. No tradeoffs should be
accepted in terms of efficiency, as the efficiency will not only affect the costs but also the impact of
the refrigerant system on the global warming.

712
713
714

Given all the examples, where non-fluorinated refrigerants are already in use in refrigeration and
heat pumping applications and their comparable efficiency, we argue that it is justifiable to have very
few (and not more than currently proposed) derogations for fluorinated gases in the PFAS restriction.

715
716
717
718

The transition to non-fluorinated working fluids is also a great opportunity for European companies
to be frontrunners and it will create increasing product demand within the heating and cooling
sector. Many jobs within the chemical companies will also stay, as they will continue to serve and
manage the aftermarket for the next decades.
