Abstract: Polyolefins are ubiquitous in consumer products but are notoriously difficult to

13

recycle due to the inherent incompatibility of their common varieties. Existing approaches

14

to addressing this challenge either require complex syntheses or compromise the properties

15

of the parent materials. Here, a new method to compatibilize mixed polyolefins is developed.

16

With a single-step photocatalysis, acid or base functionality can be readily installed onto

17

polyolefins. The combination of acid- and base-modified polyolefins functions as

18

compatibilizers. Incorporating them into polyolefin blends results in excellent mechanical

19

strength, with up to an 82-fold increase in ductility. Importantly, compatibilization can be

20

readily

21

functionalization and compatibilization of polyolefin blends is achieved. This strategy

22

promises to transform polyolefin recycling and will likely find broad applications.

23

Main Text: Polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) combined account for

24

approximately half of all plastic synthesized thanks to their excellent mechanical properties and

25

ease of production.1 They feature similar optical properties and densities and therefore are difficult

26

to separate.2 Once mixed, as is often the case in post-consumer plastic waste, PE and iPP result in

27

brittle materials with poor mechanical properties because they are inherently immiscible,

presenting one of the most significant challenges in plastic recycling. 3,4 Recognizing this issue,

29

numerous strategies have been proposed to compatibilize polyolefin blends with the addition of

30

compatibilizers (Fig. 1a). One approach involved using block or graft copolymers. 5–9 While

31

effective, the cost of these tailor-made copolymers would need to be further reduced for large-

32

scale implementations. Alternatively, dynamic crosslinkers have been explored as reactive

33

compatibilizers and shown promise.10–12 While encouraging, these strategies face significant

34

limitations. Chief among the concerns is the need for complicated catalysts, as well as the intricate

35

and multi-step reactions necessary for compatibilizer preparation. Furthermore, with the exception

36

of the copolymer-based approach, these strategies compromise ductility of the resulting polymer

37

blend that are characteristic of their parent polyolefin components.

43

It was within this context that our attention was drawn to the possibility of compatibilizing

44

polyolefins with noncovalent interactions, such as those forming between acid and base functional

45

groups. Similar concepts have been introduced as “ionic compatibilizers,” which utilized strong

46

acid and base pairs to compatibilize synthetic polystyrene and polydimethylsiloxane as a model

47

demonstration.13,14 Therefore, addressing the practical issue of compatibilizing mixed polyolefin

48

waste with similar interactions is highly appealing and promising. Uniquely, here acid–base

49

compatibilizers (ABCs) are synthesized through direct polyolefin modification, with acid or base

50

units randomly installed onto polyolefin backbones via facile hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-

51

initiated C−H activation, followed by Michael-type radical addition reactions (Fig. 1c). When

52

mixed with polyolefin blends, the polyolefins modified with acid and base functional groups form

53

close pairs through acid–base interactions and act as compatibilizers. We further hypothesize that

54

the PE and iPP segments of ABCs co-crystallize with their respective non-functionalized

55

components and thereby exhibit cohesive interactions with their counterparts at the interface

56

through acid/base interactions; as a result, the interfacial tension and domain sizes are minimized,

57

generating compatibilized blends (Fig. 1b). As a proof-of-concept, we show that an 82-fold

58

increase in elongation at break (εb) can be achieved with the addition of 10wt% of ABCs that are

59

modestly functionalized (1.4% installation of acid onto high-density PE (HDPE) and 1.4%

60

installation of base onto iPP). Importantly, the strategy is demonstrated to be readily applicable to

61

polyolefin blends, including post-consumer plastic mixtures, by directly functionalizing mixed

62

polymers using the same photochemistry, achieving a high degree of compatibilization. All

63

chemicals involved in the synthesis are commercially available and of low-cost, and the

64

functionalization is a one-step reaction with high atom efficiency (Fig. 1c), promising prospect of

65

ready large-scale implementations.

67

Reaction development

68

A natural approach to post-polymerization functionalization of polyolefins is to activate the C−H

69

bonds. A major challenge of this approach is the inert nature of aliphatic hydrocarbons. 15 While

70

organic peroxide initiators have been shown effective in generating radicals at high temperatures

71

for the grafting of maleic anhydride groups, this process often leads to undesired side reactions,

72

including β-scission, chain transfer, and cross-linking reactions that significantly degrade the

73

thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting materials. 16 Researchers are, therefore, inspired

74

to solve the issue by borrowing recent advances in C−H functionalization of small molecules and

75

applying them to polymers.17–24 The direct introduction of acid or base functional groups to

76

polyolefins, however, remains a challenge. This is because reactive acid/base species tend to

77

poison or degrade catalysts involved. Recognizing the promises by acid/base functionalized

78

polyolefins in compatibilizing their mixed blends, we are motivated to solve the challenges of

79

directly grafting acid/base functional groups onto polyolefins. To this end, a key inspiration comes

80

from recent successes in HAT catalysis by photocatalysts, which are highly specific in activating

81

C−H bonds in polyolefins without inducing significant side reactions and can be compatible with

82

acid/base species. 25 In choosing a prototypical photocatalyst to work with, we prioritize candidates

83

which will not leave a residue in the resulting polymer that would compromise its mechanical

84

properties, aside from reactivity and availability. Based on these considerations, 2-

85

chloroanthraquinone (2-ClAQ), a small molecule HAT photocatalyst, was selected as a

86

prototypical catalyst for polyolefin activation.26 Upon illumination, photoexcited 2-ClAQ species

87

feature highly electrophilic oxygen centers, which abstract H atoms from electron-rich polyolefins.

88

The resulting nucleophilic carbon-centered polyolefin radicals then react with the Michael

89

acceptors—olefins connected to electron-withdrawing functional groups—via conjugated

regenerating 2-ClAQ (Fig. 1c).

100

Given their availability and feasibility as acceptors for Michael-type radical addition reactions, 4-

101

vinylbenzoic acid (v-BA) and 4-vinylpyridine (v-Py) were chosen for the functionalization

102

reactions. A typical reaction involved 0.115 mol% of 2-ClAQ, 10 mol% of v-BA (or 20 mol% v-

103

Py, with all mol% compared to the repeat unit of polyolefins), and PE or iPP in PhCl with 365 nm

104

or 395 nm light irradiation at 110 °C (Fig. 2a). The successful functionalization and degree of

105

functionality were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR) spectra. With

106

varying reaction times, a functionality degree ranging from 0.3 mol% to 5.8 mol% was obtained

107

(Supplementary Table 1). In the cases of PE-BA, the signals of alkenes were neglectable,

108

indicating that the β-scission side reactions were minimum under the reaction conditions (Fig. 2b).

109

This observation is also supported by the slightly reduced number-average molecular weight (Mn)

110

determined

111

(Supplementary Fig. 2). Although iPP has a propensity for β-scission under radical-mediated

112

conditions, only a small amount of degradation products was detected (< 0.2 mol%), benefiting

113

from the high reactivity of the acceptors (Fig. 2d). The Mn of iPP-Py decreased with increasing

114

functionality degree (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the

115

functionalized polyolefins maintained high thermal stability compared to their virgin counterparts

116

(Fig. 2c and e). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed that the

117

introduction of a small portion of functional groups had little impact on the melting temperatures

118

and crystallization temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4). Additionally, the semicrystalline

119

structures and features of HDPE and iPP remained intact after modification with BA and Py, as

120

shown in their wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) profiles (Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6). All

121

characterization results demonstrated the newly achieved polymers exhibited thermal and physical

122

properties similar to their parent ones.

for domain statistics of TEM images in Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 1).

135

The key to acid- and base-functionalized polymers performing as compatibilizers is the

136

interactions between the acid and base functional groups. Due to the relatively small difference in

137

pKa values for BA and Py (ΔpKa ≈ 1.77), an un-ionized H-bonding interaction was anticipated

138

and confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. 27 A uniform mixture

139

of HDPE-BA and iPP-Py with the same molar amount of BA and Py functional groups as ABCs

140

was prepared through dissolution and reprecipitation, whose FTIR spectrum was compared with

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qhsj9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3935-0967 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

141

those of the individual components. The C=O stretch in the mixture shifted from 1693 cm –1 to

142

1699 cm–1, indicating the un-ionized H bond formation between BA and Py moieties

143

(Supplementary Fig. 7). The interaction observed with a small portion of acid and base in the

144

polymers supported their functionality in compatibilizing HDPE/iPP blends. To test this

145

hypothesis, a specific amount of ABCs (a mixture of 1.4%-HDPE-BA and 1.4%-iPP-Py) was

146

added to a polyolefin blend containing 70 wt% HDPE and 30 wt% iPP, with this mixture

147

representing typical polyolefin municipal waste. Due to phase separation and fragile interfaces in

148

the blend of PE and iPP, the PE/iPP blend lost the original ductility of the individual components,

149

exhibiting poor mechanical properties (εb = 21%) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8). With the

150

addition of 5 wt% of ABCs, the mechanical properties of the blend moderately improved, with an

151

εb of 52% measured. Strikingly, when the amount of ABCs increased to 10 wt%, a remarkable 82-

152

fold enhancement in ductility (εb = 1730%) was achieved (Fig. 3a). The effective compatibilization

153

of polyolefin blends with the addition of ABC was further illustrated by the reduction of iPP grain

154

size, as observed in the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission spectroscopy

155

(HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 3b–d). The average radii of iPP grains were reduced from 2.65 µm

156

to 1.13 µm with 5 wt% ABC and to 0.57 µm with10 wt% ABCs (see the supplementary materials

157

for the probability density function used to calculate the 3-dimensional domain sizes).

158

Moreover, the acid-base compatibilization can be readily applied to real-world mixed plastic waste

159

(Fig. 3e–h). Commonly used chemical containers made of HDPE (hereafter denoted as r-PE,

160

where r represents recycled) and centrifuge tubes made of iPP (denoted as r-iPP) were cleaned, cut

161

into pieces, and used for mechanical tests without further treatments. The blend of r-PE and r-iPP

162

(70:30) exhibited an εb of 60%. The average grain size of r-iPP was ca. 0.98 µm (Fig. 3g). With

163

the addition of 10 wt% ABCs, the tensile properties significantly improved, showing a 17-fold

164

increase in εb (1011% versus 60%) (Fig. 3f). The average radius of iPP droplets was also further

165

reduced (Fig. 3g and 3h), strongly supporting the improved compatibilization in post-consumer

166

polyolefin blends. The reduced domain sizes and stress transfer between phases were evidenced

167

by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fractured blend surfaces for both pure and

168

post-consumer polyolefin blends (Supplementary Fig. 9 and 10). Taken together, we demonstrated

169

that the introduction of 10 wt% ABCs, synthesized through post-polymerization functionalization,

170

restores ductility to the polyolefin blends, promising the reusage of recycled polyolefins.

177

With encouraging results demonstrated by using individually functionalized PE and iPP as ABCs,

178

we next took the scheme one step further and aimed to directly functionalize HDPE/iPP blends.

179

This approach would allow for the direct utilization of mixed polyolefin waste without the need to

180

separately synthesize compatibilizers. Instead of pursuing selective functionalization, we propose

181

that introducing respective acid and base groups to two separate batches of polyolefin blends will

182

result in acid-base interactions between components once they are blended, achieving

183

compatibilization of the otherwise immiscible materials (Fig. 4a). Given that the HAT-initiated

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qhsj9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3935-0967 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

184

modification strategy can introduce acid or base units onto both PE and iPP chains, we anticipate

185

that such reactions will occur on both components when a blend is employed. To test this

186

hypothesis, we prepared BA- and Py-functionalized HDPE:iPP blends. Since the functional groups

187

on HDPE and iPP are indistinguishable in 1H NMR spectra, we calculated average functional

188

degrees to demonstrate the amounts of BA and Py functional groups in the blends. Similar to the

189

preparation of ABCs, two blends respectively functionalized with BA and Py were mixed with the

190

same molar amount of functional groups. An ε b of 857% was detected, representing a 41-fold

191

enhancement compared to the HDPE/iPP blend (Fig. 4b). The iPP domain sizes observed in the

192

compatibilized blends were significantly reduced in comparison to neat HDPE/iPP blends (Fig.

193

3b and 4c), which was corroborated by the SEM images of the fractured blend surfaces

194

(Supplementary Fig. 11), demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy. The reactions were

195

effectively applied to the post-consumer polyolefin blends without requiring further treatment or

196

purification, aside from minimum washing to remove contaminants (Supplementary Table 1). This

197

result demonstrates the practical applicability of the current methods for direct utilization in

198

processing real-world plastic waste.

199

Conclusions

200

Overall, we have demonstrated the effective compatibilization of HDPE and iPP using ABCs

201

through a straightforward and cost-effective strategy. This strategy involves directly

202

functionalizing polyolefins by installing acid and base units onto the polyolefin molecular chains

203

via photocatalytic HAT-initiated Michael-type radical addition reactions. By incorporating 10

204

wt% of ABCs with a functionality degree of approximately 1 mol%, the HDPE/iPP blend exhibited

205

significantly improved mechanical properties, with of an ε b of 1730%, representing an 82-fold

206

enhancement in ductility compared to the untreated blends. Additionally, we demonstrated

207

successful compatibilization in post-consumer plastic blends. Furthermore, PE/iPP blends,

208

including those from post-consumer sources, can undergo modification under the same reaction

209

conditions, yielding materials with excellent ductility when the resulting acid- and base-modified

210

blends are combined. The compatibilization strategy reported here offers a practical, low-cost

211

solution for reusing mixed plastics, demonstrating both superior compatibilization and proven

212

practicality.
