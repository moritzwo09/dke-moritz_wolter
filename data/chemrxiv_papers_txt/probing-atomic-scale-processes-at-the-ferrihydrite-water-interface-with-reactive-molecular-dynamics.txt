Interfacial processes involving metal (oxyhydr)oxide phases are important for the

4

mobility and bioavailability of nutrient and contaminant elements in soils, sediments,

5

and water. Consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning,

6

and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of Earth over geologic

7

time. Here we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations, supported by syn-

8

chrotron X-ray spectroscopy to study the molecular-scale interfacial processes that in-

fluence surface complexation in ferrihydrite-water systems containing aqueous MoO4 2 – .

10

We validate the utility of this approach by calculating surface complexation models di-

11

rectly from simulations. The reactive force-field captures the realistic dynamics of

12

surface restructuring, surface charge equilibration, and the evolution of the interfacial

13

water hydrogen bond network in response to adsorption and proton transfer. We find

14

that upon hydration and adsorption, ferrihydrite restructures into a more disordered

15

phase through surface charge equilibration, as revealed by simulations and grazing inci-

16

dent X-ray scattering. We observed how this restructuring leads to a different interfacial

17

hydrogen bond network compared to bulk water by monitoring water dynamics. Us-

18

ing umbrella sampling, we constructed the free energy landscape of aqueous MoO4 2 –

19

adsorption at various concentrations and the deprotonation of the ferrihydrite surface.

20

The results demonstrate excellent agreement with the values reported by experimen-

21

tal surface complexation models. These findings are important as reactive molecular

22

dynamics opens new avenues to study mineral-water interfaces, enriching and refining

23

surface complexation models beyond their foundational assumptions.

Introduction

30

The mobility and bioavailability of nutrient and contaminant elements in soils, sediments and

31

water are strongly influenced by atomic-scale processes at mineral-water interfaces. Surface

32

adsorption or precipitation reactions can promote element attenuation, while desorption and

33

dissolution reactions may drive element release 1–3 . Ferrihydrite (Fh) and other iron (oxy-

34

hydr)oxides are often important controls on aqueous concentrations of oxyanion-forming ele-

35

ments, which can have important implications for ecosystem health and functioning 4–6 . For

36

example, molybdate (MoO4 2 – ) adsorption onto Fh surfaces has implications for biosynthesis

37

of Mo-enzymes central to global biogeochemical cycles that have shaped Earth’s biological

38

and environmental coevolution.

39

In aqueous systems, Fh typically bears a non-zero surface charge originating from the

40

ionization of the surface hydroxyl ( – OH) groups and the adsorption of dissolved ions 7,8 .

41

Oxyanions adsorption strongly influences physical, chemical, and structural properties of the

42

Fh surface 9,10 , primarily due to the induced re-organizing of water molecules altering phase

43

stability and its transformation pathways 11 . Furthermore, Fh surface charge modification

44

through adsorption not only leads to a reorientation of interfacial species, affecting both

45

their adsorption kinetics and diffusion across the interface but also alters the hydrogen bond

46

(HB) network at the interface. This alteration in the HB network additionally influences

47

the acidity of protic species, which include any species capable of donating a hydrogen ion

48

(H+ ) 8,12,13 .

49

Past studies of charged interfaces in water experiencing adsorption events have com-

50

monly relied on empirical studies, supported by various spectroscopic techniques and surface

51

complexation models (SCM), while some recent studies have used more advanced method-

52

ologies 7,14–19 . SCM account for surface charge along with solute-surface adsorption complex

53

equilibrium constants to fit a model of surface complexes to batch adsorption experiments

54

data 20,21 . The models rely upon empirical constants to describe the equilibrium between

55

aqueous species and mineral surface sites 22,23 using parameters such as surface site den-

56

sity, surface potential, intrinsic acid-base constants, and apparent complexation constants,

57

determined with the assistance of non-linear parameter estimation codes 23–25 .

58

While SCM have proven valuable, they require fitting a large amount of data under the

59

presumption that surfaces are static and homogeneous 25–28 , and simplifying the effects of wa-

60

ter chemistry 15,29–31 . Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a complementary

61

perspective by providing a realistic depiction of fluid-solid interactions. Reactive force fields

62

such as ReaxFF allow one to simulate molecular dynamics while incorporating bond-breaking

63

and formation events. They are more computationally efficient than ab initio MD 19,32,33 and

64

density functional theory (DFT) methods for the Mo(VI)-FeOx interface 19,34,35 . Reactive

65

force-fields have proven successful in modeling solid-water interfaces 36 , accurately describing

66

the restructuration of clay surfaces and interlayers in water consistent with neutron scat-

67

tering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) data 37 . Furthermore, reactive

68

force fields have been utilized to examine the reactions of water with solid surfaces. This

69

includes describing reactivity trends of various crystal surfaces towards water dissociation in

70

TiO2 38 , and studying water dissociation at the surfaces of calcium silicate hydrate micropores

71

and silica surfaces, successfully reproducing experimental properties, such as dipole moment,

72

diffusion coefficients, and proton-transfer pathways similar to the Grotthuss mechanism 39,40 .

73

Here, we use reactive MD paired with synchrotron X-ray scattering to explore processes

at the Fh-water interface, surface restructuring during aqueous MoO4 2 – adsorption. Our

75

results also explore the surface charge of Fh and interfacial HB network. Additionally, we

76

leverage our model to calculate SCM constants from simulations using umbrella sampling,

77

achieving excellent agreement for surface acidity and the concentration-dependent adsorp-

78

tion constants of MoO4 2 – . Our approach effectively integrates experimental findings with

79

theoretical models 41 , particularly in connecting MD simulations to empirical SCM parame-

The choice of molybdenum in its aqueous molybdate form (MoO4 2 – ) as a model oxyanion

82

is motivated by its dual role as an essential micronutrient and a pollutant element 42,43 .

83

Bioavailable molybdenum is crucial in the function of oxidoreductase enzymes within the

84

biogeochemical cycles of N, C, and S. Furthermore, mobile aqueous molybdenum species

85

negatively impact water quality, underscoring its significant environmental and biological

implications.

mL conical tubes, which were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was

100

decanted and 40 mL ultrapure water was added and mixed. The centrifugation process and

101

ultrapure water addition was repeated for a total of three times to remove residual salts.

102

Solids were flash frozen and freeze dried, and powder X-ray diffraction confirmed phase

103

identity.

104

Modeling Setup

105

Fh slabs and surfaces were generated based on the structure suggested by Michel et al. 45 .

106

The Fh supercell was terminated by oxygen atoms of (11̄0) plane, which accounts for 67-85,

107

% of the total surface area of Fh 46 , to emulate geochemical conditions, using Pymatgen 47 .

108

Symmetric slab with zero or no dipole moment was then selected for the preparation of 3.6

109

× 3.5 × 2.9 nm Fh supercell, with the composition of Fe946.56 H144 O1536 . Dangling surface

110

oxygens were saturated by hydrogen atoms based on their acidity.

111

Reactive MD Simulations

112

All simulations were carried out with LAMMPS package 48 using the ReaxFF pair_style as

113

implemented in LAMMPS 49 , with the ReaxFF parameters obtained for Fh 50 , Mo 51 , Na 52 ,

114

and Na – Fe cross-terms 53 . The data files for simulations were prepared using the VMD

115

TopoTools plugin and Moltemplate 54,55 . Except in the microcanonical ensemble (NVE -

116

constant number of atoms, volume, and energy) where a Berendsen thermostat was utilized,

117

in all other cases Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat with damping constants of 100

118

fs, and 1000 fs were used to control the temperature and pressure, respectively. In all

119

simulations, a time step of 0.25 fs was used to integrate Newton’s equation of motion by the

120

velocity-Verlet algorithm. The charge polarization effects of all atoms were included in the

121

simulation by calculating geometry-dependent atomic charges at every time step using the

122

charge equilibration (QEq) approach with a cutoff radii 10.0 Å for all interactions 56 .

123

The initial configuration of the slab was first minimized using the steepest descent algo6

124

rithm while stopping tolerances for energy and force were set to 10−4 and 10−6 (kcal.mol−1 .Å ),

125

respectively. To prevent melting, the temperature of the system was gradually increased in

126

a series of iterations in the NVT ensemble, starting with 10,000 steps of 0.1 Å maximum

127

distance-limited NVE (nve/limit in LAMMPS) at 1 K (damping constant 1 fs), followed

128

by NVT stages consisting of 10,000 steps at 1 K (damping constant 1 fs) and a 10,000

129

steps temperature ramp from 1 K to 300 K (damping constant 100 fs). Finally, the slab

130

was relaxed for 1 ns in the anisotropic NPT ensemble (constant number of atoms, pressure,

131

and temperature) at 298 K and 1 atm in x and y directions in a simulation cell with the

132

dimensions of approximately 4 × 4 × 6.7 nm including a 4 nm gap in the z direction, in

133

which the volume was subsequently filled with equilibrated aqueous solutions.

134

The initial configuration of solutions was prepared by randomly placing aqueous ions

135

within the 3.0 Å region of the middle of the bulk aqueous solution to yield simulations

136

of Fh and solutions containing different numbers of Na2 MoO4 (Mo-n, n= 0, 1, 2, 3, 6,

137

8), corresponding to [Na2 MoO4 ]= 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.15, and 0.2 (mol.L−1 ) with a

138

water density of 33 (particle.nm−3 ) using Packmol 57 . In the equilibration stage, solutions

139

were first simulated while turning off ReaxFF mechanism. This was achieved by treating

140

water O – H and molybdate Mo – O bonds as classical harmonic springs with a constant

141

of 50 (kcal.mol−1 .Å ). The spring constant was chosen considering the ef activeness of

142

pressure/temperature control and the stability of simulations with the used time step 58 . The

143

equilibration of solutions while water O – H and molybdate Mo – O bonds were constrained

144

using harmonic restraints, was performed for 0.2 ns, divided into stages comprising of 100 ps

145

of 0.1 Å maximum distance-limited NVE at 298 K (damping constant 100 fs), 100 ps in the

146

NVE 298 K (damping constant 50 fs), 300 ps in the canonical ensemble (NVT - constant

147

number of atoms, volume, and temperature) at 298 K (damping constant 50 fs), and 500

148

ps in the NPT at 298 K and 1 atm in z direction. For each concentration, 3 independent

149

simulations have been performed to capture statistical variations. The reactive simulations

150

for all reps are then combined and used for further analysis using in house python codes

Umbrella Sampling

153

Umbrella sampling is a technique that enables sampling of high-energy states, also known

154

as rare events, that are otherwise not feasible for direct sampling 61 during simulations. It

155

acts by enforcing an external harmonic restraint along a reaction coordinate, in a series

156

of windows, represented by a collective variable, which, in this case, is the distance of Mo

157

from the surface. This free energy along the collective variable is also referred to as the

158

potential-of-mean-force (PMF).

159

We used Colvars module interfaced with LAMMPS to perform umbrella sampling 62 . A

160

series of 20 initial configurations (windows) were generated from 0 to 20 Å from the surface

161

in the z direction (width = 1 Å). A constraining force constant of 5 Kcal.mol−1 .Å

162

used, while allowing the selected Mo atom to move in x and y directions. The selected force

163

constant resulted in sufficient overlap of the position histograms (shown in Figure SI 20),

164

allowing a smooth reconstruction of the PMF. Each window was run in NVT ensemble for

165

at least 3 ns. The PMFs were obtained using an algorithm known as WHAM (Weighted

166

Histogram Analysis Method) which is used to remove the biasing potential and reconstruct

167

the PMF with error analysis performed using the Monte Carlo bootstrap method 63,64 .

168

Synchrotron X-ray Measurements

169

All X-ray measurements were conducted at Brockhouse Diffraction Sector (BXDS) at the

170

Canadian Light Source (CLS). The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were col-

171

lected at Low Energy Wiggler Beamline (WLE) at the CLS. The measurements were con-

172

ducted by using a Kapton capillary filled with solid particles or particle dispersions. The

173

capillary was mounted and spun during the measurements to improve uniformity. A fixed

174

photon energy λ=0.819 Å with a Si (111) monochromator and Dectris Mythen2 X series 1K

175

detector system were used.

Calculations of X-ray Scattering

187

For XRD calculation, the thermal disorder was taken into account by averaging snapshots

188

from MD trajectories separated by a 1 ps time step. To further enhance the interfacial signal,

189

and emulate the experimental setup, the snapshots were limited to the interfacial region

190

found by identification of truly interfacial molecules (ITIM) algorithm. XRD patterns were

191

simulated at λ=0.819 Å with parameters for Fe(III) and Mo(VI) 66 using XrDebye module of

192

Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package 67 . The PDF plots of selected MD snapshots

193

were calculated from atomic coordinates using the Debye scattering equation implemented

194

in Diffpy-CMI as DebyeCalculator class 68 . Differential pair distribution functions (d-PDFs)

195

were calculated by subtracting a scaled reference PDF, Fh-water mixture from the PDF of

196

Fh-[Mo]aq .

Results and Discussion

198

Synchrotron X-ray Spectroscopy and Reactive Molecular Dynamics

199

The grazing-incident X-ray scattering (GIXS) experiments and ensemble-averaged MD simu-

200

lated XRD patterns (Figure 1) for synthesized Fh (a3) and MD-relaxed Fh slab (a2) display

201

poorly resolved, broad features suggesting the presence of 2-line nano-crystalline Fh with

202

a small domain size (<10 nm), consistent with PDF data 69,70 . Based on simulated XRD

203

patterns and radial distribution function (RDF) (Figure SI 3), MD relaxation of the initial

204

structure of Fh slab for MD simulations based on the Michel model 70 (a1), results in the

205

loss of long-range order to yield a Fh phase (a2) that closely resembles the experimental Fh

206

sample (a3).

207

Fh restructures in response to contact with water, which is evident in the XRD patterns

208

of both synthesized (b2) and simulated Fh (b1). These patterns exhibit increased broadening

209

and disorder compared to their respective dry structures. Upon the introduction of [Mo]aq ,

210

further adsorption-induced structural changes are observed, characterized by an increased

211

structural disorder in the lower angle region, particularly around ∼ 10◦ 2θ as seen in (c1).

212

This corresponds to the dominant surface (11̄0) plane of Fh (a2) at 10.50◦ 2θ.

213

The size of coherent scattering domains 69 determined by PDF signal attenuation of the

214

Fh/water/MoO4(aq) samples (Figure SI 5) suggests average crystallite size of 1.5-2 nm. The

215

addition of water and molybdate did not produce a noticeable change in the PDF signal.

216

The observed distances at 1.98 Å, and 3.06 Å align closely with the reported values of 2 Å

217

for the Fe – O bond in tetrahedrally coordinated iron and 3.03 Å for the Fe – Fe bond in FeO6

218

polyhedra 69 .

219

The d-PDF (c-b), comprising of peaks at 1.98, 3.10, and 3.43 Å (Figure 2-A), enhances

220

interfacial signals by isolating the interfacial region from the bulk system. This focus on

221

changes in the PDF of Fh/water introduced by [Mo]aq allows for a more detailed analysis

of interfacial interactions. The simulation of the PDF from the Mo-9 trajectory, containing

adsorbed Mo ([Mo]ads ), provides a bottom-up approach for interpreting the measured PDF.

224

This simulated total PDF aligns with the d-PDF at peak positions, exhibiting peaks at 2.04

225

Å and a broad peak with a shoulder at 3.10 Å. Detailed analysis of individual scattering pairs

226

reveals that the simulated PDF comprises peaks at 2.06 Å for Fe – O, while the broad feature

227

is a composite of Fe – Fe and Mo – O contributions at 3.09 Å and 3.40 Å, respectively. The

228

absence of the first shell peak for Mo – O in [MoO4 2 – ]aq is attributed to its low abundance.

229

Analysis of the RDF from MD trajectories (Figure 2-B), effectively determines pairwise

230

distances during simulations. The reactive MD approach, by successfully reproducing the

231

Fh structure in contact with water and at varying [Mo]aq concentrations, demonstrates the

232

appropriateness of the chosen force field. This is further substantiated by both the measured

233

PDF and RDF, which confirm that the Fh bulk maintains its local structure throughout the

234

simulations aligning with reported values of 1.98 and 3.04 Å for Fe – Fe and Fe – O distances,

235

respectively 69 .

236

RDF analysis additionally enables the monitoring of prevalent [Mo]aq distances to the Fh

237

surface (Figure 2-C). Notably, the peak positions remaining unaffected across different [Mo]aq

238

concentrations suggests the energetically favorable nature of [Mo]aq interactions with the

239

surface. The first shell peak at 1.73 Å, indicative of inner-sphere, octahedrally-coordinated

240

Mo – O, aligns with values from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (1.77

241

Å) 71 and X-ray scattering (1.78 Å) 72 . This distance is comparable with the Mo – O bond

242

length in hematite (1.73 Å) 19 , and to As – O (1.68 Å) on Fh 73 . The model architecture allows

243

for exchange processes that extend beyond proton transfer reactions and allows the formation

244

of directly-bound [Mo]aq complexes which are a result of the exchange of oxygen atoms. RDF

245

analysis also facilitates the observation of adsorbed, fully water-solvated [Mo]aq species. The

246

second shell peak at 2.80 Å corresponds to outer-sphere adsorbed [Mo]aq complexes. The

247

broad Mo – Fe feature (3.2-4.5 Å) encompasses both inner- and outer-sphere adsorbed [Mo]aq

248

complexes, aligning with the EXAFS reported range of 3.28-3.53 Å for Fh Mo – Fe 74 . Notably,

249

the proximity of outer-sphere complexes to inner-sphere complexes at these distances suggests

the potential for exchange between these states depending on the concentration of [Mo]aq

(vide infra).

Surface Interactions and Structural Dynamics

253

At equilibrium, the calculated surface charge of the Fh slab reveals a net positively charged

254

top and bottom layer. This positive charge primarily results from Fe atoms and surface

255

protons at pH = 7. This observation aligns with the reported point of zero charge (PZC) for

256

Fh (PZC=7-9) 75 .

257

To investigate the impact of [Mo]aq adsorption on Fh charge distribution, a charge differ-

258

ence plot was generated, comparing Fh in vacuum to Fh/water/[Mo]aq (Mo-8) (Figure 3-A).

259

This plot reveals localized sites, where the adsorption of negatively charged [Mo]aq leads to

260

short-range, localized charge perturbations. These perturbations are specifically confined to

261

regions where [Mo]aq forms inner-sphere complexes with the surface (Figure SI 6). Following

262

charge equilibration, these localized charge transfers collectively lead to a change in the total

263

surface charge of Fh.

264

The charge probability distribution for Fh (Figure 3-B) displays distinct characteris-

265

tics, with positively-charged Fe and H atoms, alongside negatively-charged oxygen atoms.

266

Notably, the O atom charge distribution exhibits a doublet-like feature. Upon detailed anal-

267

ysis, the more negative peak is attributed to surface oxygens, while the relatively positive

268

one corresponds to bulk Fh oxygen atoms, in water. The ITIM algorithm analysis, both in

269

the presence (Mo-8) and absence (Mo-0) of [Mo]aq , reveals that the more negatively-charged

270

oxygens are located at the interfacial regions on the top or bottom of the Fh slab (Figures

271

SI 7 and SI 8). In the case of Mo-8, the adsorption of negatively-charged [Mo]aq shifts the

272

charge distribution of Fh oxygen atoms towards a more pronounced interfacial character,

273

further indicating a charge transfer to the surface.

274

Calculating the surface charge as a function of [Mo]aq concentration (Figure 3-C) indicates

275

that water alone minimally alters the relative surface charge of Fh. As the concentration of

276

[Mo]aq increases, the surface charge of Fh becomes more negative. However, at higher [Mo]aq

277

concentrations, the relative surface charge does not continue to decrease but instead reaches

278

a plateau, as observed in the Mo-6 and Mo-8 regimes. This plateau phase is characterized

279

by larger error margins in surface charge, particularly in Mo-8, indicative of non-classical

280

overcharging behavior. This behavior is influenced by pronounced ion-ion association, which

281

affect the structure of the interfacial water hydrogen bond network, competition for adsorp-

282

tion sites on Fh, and the polymerization equilibria of [Mo]aq species 76 .

highest charge perturbations.
283

The structural dynamics of Fh during simulations are further elucidated by analyzing

284

the Fe – O – Fe bond angle probability distribution (Figure SI 9). The initial nano-crystalline

285

Michel Fh structure 70 comprises both tetrahedral (109.5º) and octahedral (90◦ , 180◦ ) Fe

286

atoms. During MD relaxation and upon contact with water, the sharp features of angle

287

probability distribution broaden, yet the tetrahedral-octahedral coordination environment

288

of Fe is retained. This observation aligns with calculations suggesting that at 298 K, for a

289

simulated Fh with a diameter of ∼3 nm, the Michel model remains slightly more stable 77 . In

290

our simulations, the initial Michel’s Fh structure does not undergo a phase transformation

291

into a fully octahedral Fe structure, also referred to as the Manceau Fh model. This high15

292

lights the stability and persistence of the mixed coordination environment under simulated

293

conditions.

294

The presence of [Mo]aq , at both low and high concentrations simulated (Mo-3 and Mo-

295

8), does not appear to induce any noticeable changes in the Fe – O – Fe angle distribution

296

(Figure SI 10). This observation highlights the interfacial nature of [Mo]aq interactions with

297

Fh, suggesting that the [Mo]aq primarily affects the surface rather than altering the bulk

298

structure of Fh.

299

The Chemistry of Water at Ferrihydrite Interface and Solution

300

We also explored non-covalent interactions, especially the HB network of water at the Fh-

301

water interface. These interactions influence the structure and dynamics at the solid-water

302

interface 78 , impacting geochemical processes such as crystallization 79 and isotopic fractiona-

303

tion 80 . In contrast to classical MD, where hydrogen bonds are not predefined and are instead

304

determined based on energy and geometric criteria 81 , the ReaxFF force field declares hy-

305

drogen bonding a priori in our reactive simulations. This approach enables more realistic

306

simulations, particularly effective in predicting the short-range cohesive forces within wa-

307

ter 82 .

308

The average number of HBs (hNH i) (Figure 4-A) gradually increases with distance from

309

the Fh surface. This trend results from the restricted mobility and fewer accessible config-

310

urations of water molecules at the interface, leading to a reduced number of HBs compared

311

to bulk water 83 . For the Fh/water system (Mo-0), hNH i approaches that of bulk water at

312

approximately 6 Å from the surface, with a transition region extending from about ∼2.5 to

313

6 Å. In the presence of [Mo]aq (Mo-8), this interfacial-to-bulk HB transition region extends

314

slightly further from the surface, before HB dynamics returns to its unperturbed bulk wa-

315

ter state. This effect is most pronounced in the 2-5 Å region from the surface, correlating

316

with the coexistence of inner- and outer-sphere [Mo]aq complexes, which can act as both HB

317

donors and acceptors.

shows surface, water, and MoO4 2 – can act as HB donors and acceptors. For the latter, the
simulations show the formation of protonated MoO4aq 2 – species that can act as HB donors
(not shown in this image).
318

[Mo]aq influences the hydrogen HB donor abilities of both surface and water oxygens

319

(Of and Ow ), with its impact being more pronounced on water oxygens (Ow ) in forming

320

HBs with Fh surface oxygens (Figure SI 11). In the presence of [Mo]aq (Mo-8), the Ow

321

donor population shifts away from the surface, compared to the Fh/water system (Mo-0).

322

This shift leads to a decrease in the average number of HBs involving Ow donors (Ow ···Of ),

323

a consequence of the competitive adsorptive interactions between [Mo]aq and Fh, limiting

324

water’s access to the surface. Regarding Fh surface donors (Of ) ((Figure 4)-B), the presence

325

of [Mo]aq in Mo-8 extends the range within which the surface can act as a donor. [Mo]aq

326

effectively out-competes water as an HB acceptor up to 5 Å from the surface, shaping a new

327

HB network with water.

328

For the HB acceptor abilities of MoO4(aq) 2 – oxygen atoms (Om ) (Figures SI 12 and

329

SI 13), at distances greater than 5 Å, [Mo]aq is fully solvated and primarily accepts HBs

330

from water. As the concentration of [Mo]aq increases from Mo-3 to Mo-8, a broader range

331

of HB interactions between Of ···Om emerges, indicating the onset of [Mo]aq adsorption.

332

[Mo]aq HB donor abilities (Figure SI 14), suggest that the reactive simulation predicts the

333

formation of protonated [Mo]aq species with lifetimes long enough to form HBs. Adsorbed

334

[Mo]aq out-competes water in HB donor abilities up to 5 Å from the surface.

335

The HB acceptor and donor abilities of Om emphasize the crucial role of outer-sphere

336

complexes in mediating surface interactions through HBs 84 . The disruption of HB networks is

337

energetically costly, and the surface HB abilities determine its affinity to water. Additionally,

338

interfacial HB between solutes and water likely reduce its adsorption energy 85 . Consequently,

339

the model predicts various pathways that affect the adsorption free energy.

340

The reactive simulations provide insights into the behavior of species in bulk solution,

341

particularly highlighting the exchange of oxygen atoms between water and molybdate groups

342

(Figure SI 15). This exchange is evident when monitoring the distance of Mo with water

343

oxygens within a 4 Å shell. Over time, and as hydration of [Mo]aq progresses, water oxygens

344

segregate into two distinct groups around [Mo]aq : directly bonded oxygens at ∼1.78 Å,

345

forming Mo – Ow bonds, consistent with the reported experimental value 72 , and the first

346

hydration shell observed at 2-2.5 Å. This is also reflected in RDF of Mo and water oxygen

347

(Mo – Ow) (Figure SI 16). The results suggest that at equilibrium in solution, Mo – Om bonds

348

are susceptible to hydrolysis, indicating the dynamic and reactive nature of the hydration

349

process.

350

Furthermore, the model accurately describes the behavior of solvents and counter-ions.

351

The RDF of water (Ow – Ow ) (Figures SI 17) gives a good reproduction of both experimental

352

and ReaxFF values at room temperature 86 . Notably, there is a slight increase in the height

353

of the first peak of the water Ow – Ow RDF. This difference may be attributed to stronger

354

interactions between water molecules, potentially heightened by nano-confinement effects

355

between hydrophilic Fh layers 86 . In addition, the RDF of Na – Ow (Figure SI 18), suggests

356

a hydrated Na+ cation with a water solvation shell at 2.50 Å. This observation aligns with

357

the reported values for ReaxFF electrolyte systems 52 , further validating the model accuracy

358

in describing the solvation structure of Na+ in aqueous environments.

arrows denote the exchange between the two complexes.

361

Energetics of Adsorption

362

The electron density profiles of [Mo]aq as a function of distance from the Fh surface (Figure

363

5-A) offer a kinetic perspective on [Mo]aq distribution. This surface is defined as the top

364

interfacial layer of Fh, identified using the ITIM algorithm in each simulation snapshot. The

365

dynamic and rough nature of the Fh surface necessitates this approach.

366

At infinite dilution (Mo-1), the non-zero electron density at a range of distances of 2.5-10

367

Å from the surface and farther in the bulk solution, indicates that [Mo]aq moves between the

368

adsorbed and diffused states. As the concentration of [Mo]aq increases from Mo-2 to Mo-8,

369

the inner-sphere complexes move closer to the surface at a distance of 2-4 Å, and outer-sphere

370

complexes are positioned in 4-7 Å from the surface. At higher concentrations (Mo-6, Mo-8),
19

371

more [Mo]aq are also present at farther distances to up to 10-15 Å and rather than in the

372

bulk solution signifying the strength of adsorptive interactions between [Mo]aq and Fh. At

373

lower concentrations (Mo-2, Mo-3), the electron density peaks corresponding to inner- and

374

outer-sphere complexes of [Mo]aq show minimal or no overlap, suggesting less exchange of

375

[Mo]aq between these two adsorbed states. However, at higher concentrations (Mo-6, Mo-8),

376

there is a notable overlap between the peaks for inner- and outer-sphere complexes. This

377

overlap indicates a facilitated exchange between the two states.

378

As previously discussed in the Methods section, to comprehensively access the full range of

379

the free energy landscape and the probability distribution of [Mo]aq as a function of distance

380

from the surface (Figure 5-B) (SI 21), umbrella sampling is employed. This technique is

381

capable of sampling states that are high in energy, with energy barriers exceeding kB T

382

(2.479 kJ.mol−1 at 298 K), which are often referred to as rare events.

383

At infinite dilution (Mo-1) the free energy shows a flat profile with small energy barriers

384

between different adsorbed states and bulk states, consistent with the electron density profile.

385

At relatively low concentrations of [Mo]aq (Mo-2-3), two distinct adsorbed states of – inner-

386

and outer-sphere complexes – are predominantly observed. Inner-sphere complexes, forming

387

at distances of up to 3 Å from the surface, are more energetically favorable by about 15-20

388

kJ.mol−1 compared to outer-sphere complexes at distances >3-7.5 Å. This energy difference

389

results in a lower desorption rate (kIS→OS ) from the surface consistent with electron density

390

profiles for Mo-3 mostly consisting of inner-sphere complexes and Mo-2 having two distinct

391

absences of electron density at the onset of ∼2.5 Å. Meanwhile, outer-sphere complexes are

392

located at 4-5 Å from the surface, characterized by a smaller or negligible energy barrier and

393

a higher rate of transition to inner-sphere complexes (kOS→IS ). The observed energy barrier

394

between the inner- and outer-sphere states in both directions is likely attributable to the

395

solvation/desolvation of [Mo]aq , the displacement and reorientation of water in the solvation

396

sphere of [Mo]aq and at the Fh surface, and the disruption of the hydrogen bond network at

397

the interface 87 .

398

At higher [Mo]aq concentrations (Mo-6 to Mo-8), the adsorption free energy ranges be-

399

tween -15 and -10 kJ.mol−1 . In this regime, the energy barrier between inner- and outer-

400

sphere complexes disappears entirely. This phenomenon is likely due to the effects of surface

401

charge screening by the adsorbed [Mo]aq species 88,89 .

402

Acidity of Surface Protons

403

We have selected Fh surface protons based on their equilibrium charge (high, low, medium)

404

(Figure SI 22) after reactive MD in water (Mo-0) to calculate the pKa of the corresponding

405

surface oxygen sites using umbrella sampling. Surface acidity, determined by the pKa of

406

surface hydroxyl groups is foundational in predictive SCM. These pKa ’s which are generally

407

found by titration measurements are not capable of assigning individual pKa ’s for different

408

surface protons and are challenging due to mineral dissolution during the titration. The sur-

409

face reactivity strongly depends on the surface acidity and is critical in understanding the

410

adsorption of solutes at water-mineral interfaces. Computational approaches to calculating

411

unique surface species pKa do not rely on fitting experimental parameters and can yield valu-

412

able information on surface chemical behavior and its interface with water. The idea behind

413

these computational methods is to calculate the free energy difference between the proto-

414

nated/deprotonated surface sites mostly through ab initio MD, and PMF techniques 90,91 .

415

The studied deprotonation sites are selected based on their chemical environment (coordi-

416

nation number -connected to 1 or 2 Fe or species Al – OH vs Si – OH).

417

The summarized results (Table 1) show surface deprotonation is an endergonic process

418

in water at pH = 7. The results also show that there is no direct relationship between the

419

initial charge of the proton and its pKa value giving an emphasis to other factors, such as the

420

local chemical environment of the proton, its interface, (de)hydration effects, and hydrogen

421

bonding affecting the final deprotonated state of the hydrogen atoms. The calculated pKa

422

values agree well with reported charge distribution multi-site ion complexation (MUSIC)

Adsorption Constants

426

The adsorption constants for different [Mo]aq complexes with the surface of Fh, calculated

427

by SCM, linear free energy relationships (LFER) and the current study are summarized in

428

Table 2. Although the SCM calculations for adsorbed inner-sphere complexes are performed

429

at pH > 5 and with taking into account the acidity of (HO)MoO3 – (pKa =4.2), partially or

430

fully protonated Mo species needed to be introduced to improve the model. The calculated

431

adsorption constant for MoO4 2 – adsorbed as FeOHMoO4 – 2 , from reactive simulations free

432

energy profile, was found to be 3.14, slightly higher than the value by LFER calculation.

433

Using the adsorption PMF results (Figure 5-B), the adsorption constants for [Mo]aq in Mo-

434

1-8 were calculated. The weight-averaged LogKa over all trajectories was then calculated

435

using the Equations 3-4. The calculated LogKa of 3.39 is attributable to the greater influ-

436

ence (lower error) of data points in regimes of higher concentration, potentially due to a

437

better representation of experimental conditions. The observed slight difference with SCM

438

fitting methodologies can be linked to the use of different parameters in deriving the values.

439

However, the general agreement with the reported values suggests a holistic approach that

440

can be further expanded by varying simulation conditions.

Environmental Implications

442

Global biogeochemical N, C, and S cycles that have shaped the environmental and biological

443

co-evolution of Earth are dependent upon the mobility and the bioavailability of aqueous nu-

444

trient and contaminant elements, such as oxidoreductase enzymes cofactors requiring cellular

445

uptake of aqueous molybdate (MoO4 2 – ) ions 42,43 .

446

Geochemical reactions involving Fe- and S-bearing minerals have regulated MoO4 2 – mo-

447

bility and availability over geologic time 1,2 . Interfacial reactions with Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide

448

(FeOx ) phases often limit aqueous MoO4 2 – concentrations in soils, sediments, and waters 4,5 .

449

Unravelling these complex reaction mechanisms and pathways is important for understand-

450

ing MoO4 2 – availability in modern environments and paleoenvironments. SCM commonly

451

used to describe the adsorption of nutrient and pollutant elements rely on assumptions that

452

can be furthered refined to provide new insights into these interfacial interactions. Here, we

453

employ reactive MD and synchrotron X-ray techniques to show how hydration and adsorp-

454

tion of aqueous MoO4 2 – affects the surface charge of Fh which initiates a restructuration

455

towards a more disordered phase response observable in simulations and experiments. The

fects a wide range of chemistry at the interface such as hydrogen bonding and even the

458

dynamics and energetics of exchange between inner- and outer-sphere adsorbed complexes

459

with important implications for the bioavailability and transport of the aqueous species, as

460

well as, implications in isotopic fractionation mechanisms 93 . The accuracy of our model was

461

further tested by deriving SCM parameters for Fh surface acidity and the adsorption con-

462

stants of [Mo]aq showing excellent agreement with the literature. This new approach enables

463

informing and improving SCM where experimental work is not feasible or for expanding the

464

chemical conditions explored for accurately describing adsorption via SCM or our current

model. This work offers a new way of looking into interfacial processes and more studies

about phase transformation of other Fe (oxy)hydroxide phases with different aqueous metals

is currently underway.
