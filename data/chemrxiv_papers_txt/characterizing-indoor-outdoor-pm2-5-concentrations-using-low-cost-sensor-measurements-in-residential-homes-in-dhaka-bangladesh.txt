Abstract
We collected paired measurements of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations at 17 homes in Dhaka,
Bangladesh, to quantify indoor-outdoor levels, their spatio-temporal variations, and influencing
factors. A pair of PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors were deployed at each home, one indoors and the other
outdoors, during the wet (June to August 2021) and dry (December 2021 to February 2022) seasons,
and the locally calibrated (against a beta attenuation monitor) and quality-assured data were used for
analysis. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels were three times higher during the dry season (indoor 146 ±
22 µg/m³, outdoor 153 ± 23 µg/m³) than during the wet season (indoor 52 ± 12 µg/m³, outdoor 50 ±
11 µg/m³). Indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratios were close to 1 in both seasons (dry: 0.97 ± 0.14, wet: 1.05 ±
0.19). This suggests that regional background pollution levels significantly influence indoor levels
observed in different households. Higher infiltration factors (dry: 0.83 ± 0.12; wet: 0.87 ± 0.14),
determined through mixed effect regression of parallel indoor and outdoor timeseries data, further
highlight the substantial impact of outdoor pollution on indoor levels. Data from individual
households exhibited strong temporal correlation between indoor and outdoor levels in both seasons
(Pearson R: 0.82 ± 0.12 during the dry season and 0.83 ± 0.14 during the wet season), whereas
indoor-outdoor spatial correlations across measured households were moderate (R: 0.49 and 0.62
during dry and wet seasons, respectively). These spatial correlations and empirical regression
modeling suggest that while the spatial variation of outdoor PM2.5 levels significantly influences
indoor levels' spatial variation, other factors such as indoor source activities and ventilation-related
features play crucial roles in explaining variabilities in indoor PM2.5 across homes. Overall, our study
suggests that indoor environments in Dhaka city are nearly as polluted as outdoor settings, and this
locally derived scientific evidence can be valuable for enhancing public awareness and developing
mitigation measures to reduce PM2.5 exposures in Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), consisting of airborne particles with diameters below 2.5 micrometers,
originates from various sources and poses substantial health risks to humans1–3. Individual daily exposures to
PM2.5 are influenced by numerous factors, including time spent in different indoor and outdoor environments,
weather conditions, indoor sources, infiltration of outdoor pollution into indoor settings, and ventilation
systems4–6. Regional and local outdoor pollution can significantly elevate indoor PM2.5 levels through
infiltration, while indoor sources, like cooking and cleaning, contribute to indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels4–8.
Effective air quality management necessitates a comprehensive understanding of PM2.5 sources, dynamics, and
population exposure in both indoor and outdoor settings8–10. However, understanding PM2.5 sources and
exposure in many developing countries is largely impeded by a lack of monitoring data, particularly in South
Asian countries11–13. These countries are ranked as global hotspots of PM2.5, with thousands of premature
deaths annually attributed to severe outdoor and indoor elevated levels of PM2.53,14,15. Bangladesh, with its
population of 170 million, is one such country where the annual mean outdoor PM2.5 levels range from 80 to
100 µg m-3 14,16,17, which is about 15-20 times higher than the recent standard set by the World Health
Organization (WHO).
Past studies in Bangladesh, employing limited ground monitoring data, satellite data, and modeling analysis,
indicate significantly higher PM2.5 concentrations across the country with distinct seasonal patterns;
concentrations are 2-6 times higher in dry seasons compared to wet seasons18,19. Seasonal sources,
meteorology, and transboundary pollution play a pivotal role in determining PM2.5 population exposure in
Bangladesh14,17,18,20–23. PM2.5 concentration gradients are observed across the country, with higher levels in the
central and northwest regions and relatively lower levels in the southeast part of the country, likely influenced
by strong transboundary air pollution effects from Indian states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region14,24–26.
Short-term air quality monitoring using handheld monitors has been employed in previous studies in
Bangladesh to assess air pollution exposures in various micro-environments, including households in rural and
urban areas27,28, the outdoor urban environment29, locations near brick kilns30,31, and schools32. A study by
Gurley et al.28 in a low-income community in Dhaka, Bangladesh, reported a substantial fraction of hours in a
day with indoor PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 100 µg/m³. These studies provide insights into substantial
variabilities in PM2.5 exposures across micro-environments. However, they often lacked repeated sample
collections, limiting their effectiveness in capturing spatio-temporal dynamics33–35. Systematic repeated shortterm sampling across multiple seasons at 35 locations in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, revealed a moderate intraurban spatial gradient for PM2.5 and a large gradient for ultrafine particle number concentration (PNC)36.
The majority of past studies in Bangladesh focus on characterizing PM2.5 exposures in outdoor
microenvironments; thus, the scarcity of indoor air pollution monitoring data is more severe14,37–39. However,
many past studies around the world suggest that PM2.5 concentration levels in indoor environments could also
be significantly high, contingent upon indoor and outdoor sources, ventilation and building systems, geographic
locations, people's behaviors, and various other factors4,5,7,40–43. Understanding the indoor-outdoor relationship
of PM2.5 is important for developing evidence-based mitigation measures. Nonetheless, the relationship
between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels and their spatio-temporal variations remains largely unexplored in
Bangladesh. The high capital cost of traditional air quality monitoring at higher temporal and spatial resolutions
largely hinders high spatio-temporal measurements in Bangladesh.
Recent advancements in low-cost sensor technology offer a more affordable means of air quality monitoring
with higher temporal and spatial resolutions, enabling continuous measurements and broader coverage across a
city44,45. Nevertheless, proper calibration against reference monitors and careful data interpretation are essential
to ensure the accuracy of low-cost sensor measurements46–48. Leveraging low-cost sensors presents an
opportunity to address significant data gaps, particularly in exploring within-city variations in indoor and
outdoor PM2.5 exposures in Bangladesh.
To address these gaps, our study implemented locally calibrated low-cost sensors to investigate indoor and
outdoor PM2.5 exposures in various households in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We collected parallel measurements of
indoor and outdoor PM2.5 at 17 homes in Dhaka city by deploying a pair of PurpleAir low-cost PM2.5
sensors49,50 at each home, one positioned indoors and another outdoors, and collected data across multiple

seasons. Analyzing this dataset, we characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of indoor and outdoor
PM2.5 concentrations across diverse households, elucidated the interplay between indoor and outdoor PM2.5
levels, and identified key factors influencing these relationships.
2 Methods
2.1 Sampling Homes
Figure 1A shows the locations of the 17 sampled homes within Dhaka city. These selected sites represent a
diverse range of land-use characteristics, including major road density, restaurant density, and population
density around each location, as illustrated in Figure 1B. Before initiating air pollution data collection, we
conducted a questionnaire survey to gather information about indoor features in the sampled homes, focusing
on kitchen features, cooking practices, and ventilation arrangements. Table S1 summarizes these indoor
features in the sampling homes.
All selected homes were apartment units, situated on floors ranging from the 1st to the 6th in different
buildings. Apartments were selected as they represent the predominant residential housing option in Dhaka
city. These homes were located within 50-500 meters of arterial roads and bus routes, with apartment sizes
ranging between 850-3400 square feet (mean 1685 square feet). The number of windows in the apartment units
varied between 3-11 (mean 5.4), and the number of occupants ranged from 1-6 (mean 4.2).
Natural ventilation served as the primary air exchange mechanism in the selected homes. Most homes had
window-type air conditioning units, particularly in the bedrooms; none were equipped with central air
conditioning or mechanical ventilation systems, nor did they possess air purifying units. These features reflect
typical residential scenarios in Dhaka city.
None of the selected homes used solid biomass-based cook stoves. Kitchens were equipped with either gas
stoves or electric stoves, and the presence of exhaust fans in the kitchen, with or without hoods, was common
in all sampled homes. A subset of homes (5 out of 17) was equipped with kitchen hoods. The frequency of
cooking per day varied between 1-3 (mean 2.1), with a daily cooking duration ranging from 1-4 hours (mean
2.8 hours), primarily involving frying and boiling. Among the 17 homes studied, 7 were inhabited by primary
smokers, and 3 homes reported occasional use of mosquito coils.

restaurant density, and population density within a 1 km buffer radius from each measurement site.
2.2 Measurements of Indoor and Outdoor PM2.5 in Different Homes
PM2.5 data were collected in various homes across two distinct seasons: wet (June to August 2021; “summer”)
and dry (December 2021 to February 2022; “winter”), with approximately one week of continuous
measurement at each home during each season. While 17 homes participated in the study, 2 homes did not
participate in the wet season, and another two homes did not participate in the dry season, resulting in data
from both seasons being available for 13 homes.
A pair of PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors was deployed at each home, with one sensor placed indoors and another
outdoors within the same apartment. This setup enabled simultaneous measurement of indoor and outdoor
PM2.5 concentration levels at each selected home, capturing dynamic variations in pollution levels inside and
outside the home. The indoor sensors were positioned either in the bedroom or living room of each home at a
height of approximately 5 feet from the floor, while the outdoor sensors were primarily placed on balconies at a
similar height. Careful consideration was given to the placement of outdoor sensors to avoid close proximity to
kitchen exhausts.
Four PurpleAir sensors (Purple Air, Classic Air Monitor, Edition: PA-II-SD) were available, allowing for
simultaneous measurements in two homes at a time. Each home was monitored for approximately one week
during a particular season, resulting in an overall data collection period of about 10-12 weeks per season to
cover all participating homes. < Total number of household-days of paired indoor-outdoor measurement.>
PurpleAir uses Plantower sensors to optically detect PM2.551. Each PurpleAir is equipped with two identical
particulate sensors, alongside temperature and relative humidity sensors. The sensors quantify number
concentrations of various PM fractions, with internal calibrations converting particle counts into PM mass
concentrations. The PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors deployed at each home recorded data at two-minute intervals,
storing it on SD cards.
2.3 Long-term Continuous Outdoor PM2.5 Measurements
In addition to measuring indoor and outdoor PM2.5 at various homes, we analyzed outdoor PM2.5 data from two
continuous air monitoring stations (CAMS) in Dhaka city. The locations of these two stations are depicted in
Figure 1A. One station is operated by the Department of Environment (DoE), Bangladesh (DoE CAMS), while
the other is situated inside the US Embassy Dhaka (USE CAMS). Each station employs a MetOne BAM-1020
to measure hourly PM2.5, a real-time monitoring method compliant with the US-EPA federal equivalent method
(FEM). Analyzing data from these CAMS stations allowed us to compare them with measurements from
different homes, deriving co-location calibration factors for PurpleAir Sensors (section 2.4.2) and temporal
adjustment factors for relatively short-term measurement at different homes (section 2.4.3).
2.4 Data Analysis and Quality Assurance
2.4.1 Analyzing PurpleAir PM2.5 Data
The raw PurpleAir PM2.5 data collected at different homes underwent meticulous quality assessment, involving
visual inspection of raw time series data and the exclusion of any outliers or suspicious data points. Each
PurpleAir unit has two identical planttower sensors, and in the majority of cases, the data from both sensors
showed congruence within a ± 10% margin. Only a marginal less than 2% of the data deviated from this
threshold and were subsequently excluded from the analysis. For data that agreed within the ± 10% margin, the
average of PM2.5 measurements from both sensors were calculated at a 2-minute resolution. Subsequently,
hourly averages were estimated using this 2-minute time resolution data.
PurpleAir unit reports two different PM2.5 values (PM2.5_cf_1 and PM2.5_cf_atm) using separate internal
calibration factors49,50,52. While these two values were highly correlated, the absolute magnitudes of PM2.5_cf_1
were consistently higher than PM2.5_cf_atm. For our analysis, we used raw PM2.5_cf_atm values and corrected
them using co-location calibration factors against a reference PM2.5 monitor.

We applied two adjustment factors to hourly average raw PM2.5 measurements from various homes: one for colocation calibration against a reference monitor47 (section 2.4.2) and another for temporal adjustment for shortterm sampling53 (section 2.4.3). Then, using these corrected hourly time series data, we investigated variability
in indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration levels, as well as the ratio of indoor to outdoor (I/O) concentrations
across different homes, seasons, and times of day. The indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) concentration ratio is a
commonly employed technique to assess the influence of outdoor pollution on indoor concentration levels54.
To examine the meteorological conditions during measurements collected in different homes, we also analyzed
temperature and relative humidity data from PurpleAir sensors. A summary of the mean meteorological
conditions (temperature and relative humidity) during measurements at various homes is provided in Table S2.
Across all sampling homes, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of outdoor temperature and relative humidity
during the dry (winter) season were 26.3 ± 3.1°C and 46.7 ± 6.6%, respectively, while during the wet (summer)
season, they were 33.7 ± 1°C and 57.5 ± 4.3%, respectively. Indoor temperature and relative humidity were
within ±10% of outdoor conditions in both seasons.
2.4.2 Co-location Calibration of PurpleAir PM2.5 Sensors
To develop calibration factors under local meteorological and pollution conditions for the PurpleAir sensors
used in this study, we conducted co-location calibration experiments of all sensors used for home samplings
against the BAM at the DoE CAMS station. Colocation experiments were conducted over two seasons, wet
(April-May 2022) and dry (November 2022), with approximately a month-long data collection period in each
season.
The collocation dataset was used to derive correction factors through regression analysis47,49. Collocated
measurements from various sensors exhibited strong consistency, with Pearson correlation coefficients (R)
ranging from 0.99 to 1 across sensor batches (Figure S1). Therefore, regression models were developed by
combining data from all sensors, although separate calibration models were derived for each season. Details
regarding colocation data collection, linear regression fittings, derived coefficients, and model performances
are illustrated in Figure S1. Linear regression models produced R2 values of 0.87 in the dry season and 0.83 in
the wet season, with corresponding normalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) of 14% and 17%,
respectively, for the dry and wet seasons.
In addition to the simple linear regression model, we explored multiple linear regression models47 that included
temperature, relative humidity, dew points, and various interaction terms of these meteorological variables
(Table S3). However, these models did not significantly enhance model performance, resulting in a reduction
of nRMSE by less than 1%. Therefore, for the purpose of applying correction, we applied the season-specific
simple linear regression model (corrected PM2.5 = slope × PurpleAir Measured PM2.5 + intercept) to adjust
hourly time series data collected in different homes. The same factor was employed to correct both indoor and
outdoor data.
2.4.3 Adjustment for Temporal Variability
As simultaneous measurement at all homes was not feasible due to the limited number of available sensors, we
adopted a rotating approach, conducting one week of data collection at each home over a 10-12 week campaign
in a season. This posed a challenge for direct comparison of variability in measured concentrations across
different homes. The observed variability could arise from spatial differences in measured concentrations in
different homes as well as week-to-week temporal fluctuations of city background PM2.5 levels. Week-to-week
temporal variations of city background PM2.5 levels are expected to be nearly uniform across the city since they
are largely dictated by meteorological phenomena (such as atmospheric inversion and long-range transported
pollution), which affect all sites across the city similarly. Our analysis of data from two CAMS sites within
Dhaka city supports this, where we found that the ratio of weekly mean to long-term seasonal mean at each site
follows almost a similar trend (Figure S2).
To account for temporal variations, we applied a temporal adjustment factor to the measurement from each
home based on long-term continuous measurements at a reference site (i.e., CAMS site in the US Embassy,
Dhaka). There are two commonly used methods for temporal adjustment used in past studies: the difference
method55 and the ratio method53. Both methods rely on adjusting the spatially and temporally distributed
measurements with data collected at the central reference site. We adopted the ratio method for our analysis.
Following the method of Eeftens et al.53, we calculated temporally corrected concentrations for site i by
6
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7wrlw ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4044-9350 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

multiplying the uncorrected concentration at site i in period t by the ratio between the long-term concentration
measured at the reference site (over 10-12 weeks, encompassing the data collection period at all homes in a
season), and the concentration measured at that same reference site during period t (typically 1 week at each
season); Ci,t,corr = (Cref, long-term / Cref, t)×Ci,t,un_corr..
An example of the derivation of such temporal correction factors is provided in Figure S3. We derived
correction factors as a function of the hour of the day by comparing the long-term average diurnal profile to the
short-term average diurnal profile at the CAMS location. We estimated such factors for the measurement
period at each different home and each season. Then, we applied these factors to measured concentrations from
each home as a function of the hour so that if we used the corrected hourly time series to estimate mean
concentrations at each home, the resulting mean concentration should give a quasi-long-term mean
concentration.
Both BAM collocation correction factors and temporal adjustment factors were derived based on outdoor
concentrations. When we applied these correction factors to correct data from different homes, we used the
same factors for both indoor and outdoor measurements. We do not anticipate substantial bias from applying
the same correction factors to both indoor and outdoor sensors. This is because indoor PM2.5 levels are largely
influenced by outdoor levels, as suggested by the high correlation and similarity in diurnal and seasonal
patterns observed in measured indoor and outdoor PM2.5 from different homes, as discussed in detail in the
results sections. Moreover, in the absence of indoor-specific correction factors, which were not feasible for
both BAM collocation and derivation of temporal adjustment factors, applying outdoor-derived factors allows
us to correct the data using the best available correction factors, thereby improving the quantitative assessment
of the absolute value of PM2.5 concentrations. For relative assessment, such as the comparison of
indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio of PM2.5 in different homes, these correction factors do not make any difference.
2.5 Analyzing Relationships Between Indoor and Outdoor PM2.5 Levels
2.5.1 Temporal Relationship
Utilizing corrected hourly time series data from each home, we investigated the temporal relationship between
indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels measured in different homes and seasons using the Pearson correlation
coefficients. Furthermore, we applied a statistical regression technique called mixed-effects regression56 to
quantify the infiltration factor of outdoor pollution indoors.
The mixed-effects regression analysis, as employed in previous indoor-outdoor air pollution studies40,54,57,58,
involves fitting timeseries of indoor and outdoor concentrations to a linear regression equation (y = mx + c;
where y represents indoor concentration, x denotes outdoor concentrations, m indicates the slope, and c
indicates the intercept). However, unlike simple linear regression, mixed-effects regression allows for variation
in both the slope and intercept of the regression relationship. This analysis is conducted separately for each
home and each season. Regression is carried out using the 'lmer' function of the 'lme4' package in the R
programming language.
The coefficients obtained from mixed-effect regression analysis can provide valuable insights. In prior studies
, the slope is typically interpreted as the infiltration factor of outdoor pollution (the proportion of
outdoor pollution infiltrated indoors), while the intercept signifies the contribution of indoor sources to indoor
PM2.5 levels.
40,54,57,58

In our analysis, we allowed both the slope and intercept of the regression to vary based on the time of day. This
approach aimed to capture real-world dynamics, where indoor-generated levels fluctuate with indoor activities
such as cooking and cleaning. Similarly, the infiltration of outdoor pollution may vary throughout the day due
to changes in ventilation settings (typically, windows remain open during the daytime and closed at night),
fluctuations in outdoor concentration levels due to meteorological factors (such as changes in mixing height),
and variations in local outdoor source strength (such as traffic during rush hours).
2.5.2 Spatial Relationship
Using mean PM2.5 concentrations from each measured home, we examined the spatial relationship between
indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels measured across diverse homes using the Pearson correlation coefficient. To
7
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7wrlw ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4044-9350 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

explore the factors influencing spatial variability, we conducted univariate and multivariate regression analyses
with indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels and various indoor and outdoor physical features at measurement
locations. Various physical features used in regression analysis were collected during a baseline questionnaire
survey at the selected homes (Table S1). These include apartment size, number of windows, cooking habits,
and kitchen features (cooking duration, presence of exhaust fan, kitchen hood), as well as other indoor sources
such as the use of mosquito coils and presence of smokers in the apartment. The analysis is conducted using
season-specific mean PM2.5 values as well as the overall mean PM2.5 from both seasons.
The goal of the multiple linear regression analysis was to identify important features and develop a model that
explains the spatial variability for indoor PM2.5. This model development process resembled that of empirical
land-use regression models34,59, where measured concentrations and land-use covariates are regressed to
establish a statistical relationship. We used various indoor features (Table S1) and mean outdoor PM2.5 from
measured homes as potential covariates.
For the multiple linear regression analysis, the selection of predictor variables among the available list of
potential covariates followed a supervised stepwise regression approach34,60. In this process, the model selects
variables one at a time based on the adjusted R-squared (coefficient of determination) of univariate linear
regressions, starting with the variable that provides the highest adjusted R-squared. The variable selection
process continues until a newly added variable would improve the overall model adjusted R-squared by more
than 1%. Variables with p-values (predictor significance) exceeding 0.1 were removed from the selected set.
We employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
Model performance was evaluated using adjusted R-squared and root mean square error (RMSE) for both
model development and cross-validation. The model development was implemented in the R programming
language.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Measured Indoor and Outdoor PM2.5 Levels
Table 1 presents the mean indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations and indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios from
individual homes, while Figure 2 illustrates measurement variability. Data are shown separately for dry and wet
seasons. In the dry season, across all sampled homes, the overall mean ± SD of indoor PM2.5 was 146 ± 22
µg/m³, outdoor 153 ± 23 µg/m³, and the I/O ratio 0.97 ± 0.14. In the wet season, indoor levels were 52 ± 12
µg/m³, outdoor 50 ± 11 µg/m³, and the I/O ratio 1.05 ± 0.19. Both indoor and outdoor levels were
approximately three times higher during dry seasons compared to the wet season, while the I/O ratios remained
similar. Mean PM2.5 levels from two outdoor CAMS measurements were 162 µg/m³ and 50 µg/m³ during the
dry and wet seasons, respectively, also showing about a threefold seasonal difference.
Large seasonal differences were consistently observed in all measurement locations, including indoor and
outdoor levels of sampled homes and outdoor CAMS locations. This indicates that the large seasonal
differences are due to variations in regional background pollution levels between seasons. While there are
variations between indoor and outdoor levels within specific homes and between homes during a particular
season, these differences are relatively smaller (vary between 10-30%) compared to differences between
seasons, which are approximately a factor of three.
In Bangladesh, substantial seasonal differences in PM2.5 levels are influenced by seasonal meteorology,
transboundary pollution influx, and seasonal sources14,20,22,24. During the dry season, factors contributing to
higher concentrations include long-range transported pollution from neighboring countries, particularly driven
by predominant winds from the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) states; seasonal sources such as solid
biomass burning in brick kilns, construction activities; and meteorological phenomena like reduced
atmospheric mixing, less rainfall. On the other hand, heavy rainfall during the monsoon, along with a relatively
lesser impact from long-range transport, driven by predominant winds from the Bay of Bengal, are likely
important factors contributing to observed lower PM2.5 levels in the wet season.
Despite notable seasonal variations in PM2.5 concentrations, the I/O ratios of PM2.5 from each season were
similar and closer to 1. This suggests that regional background air pollution levels have a large influence on
indoor pollution levels in different households. While there were home-to-home variations of measured I/O
8

ratios, on average, these variations were relatively small and remained within ±15% of 1 in both seasons. This
underscores that, regardless of seasons, the indoor environment of residential homes in Dhaka city is nearly as
polluted as outdoor settings, with pollution levels in many homes surpassing outdoor levels. Our observed
PM2.5 I/O ratios of closer to 1 are consistent with findings from several past studies in India, China, and other
regions7,43,54,61–63.

The horizontal dashed line in panels B and D serves as a visual guide.
3.2 Diurnal Variations of Indoor and Outdoor PM2.5
Figure 3 shows the daily fluctuations in indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels, along with their corresponding
indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios, in the dry and wet seasons. Both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels showed
significant variability throughout the day, with more pronounced fluctuations during the dry season compared
to the wet season.
Outdoor PM2.5 levels were relatively higher during nighttime and early morning hours, and lower during the
afternoon. When comparing the average diurnal profiles across all measurement locations, outdoor PM2.5 levels
were 15-25% higher than average during nighttime and early morning in the dry season, and 10-15% higherthan-average during the wet season. Levels were 30-35% and 10-15% lower-than-average in the afternoon
during the dry season and wet season, respectively.
These diurnal variations are primarily influenced by meteorological conditions, particularly the diurnal
variation of the atmospheric mixing layer36,64. The height of the atmospheric boundary layer tends to increase
during midday and decrease at night, resulting in lower PM2.5 concentrations during midday and higher
concentrations during nighttime and early morning hours64. Consistent variation patterns observed across
different homes throughout the city and outdoor CAMS locations also suggest the significant influence of
meteorological and atmospheric phenomena on outdoor diurnal profiles.
In contrast to outdoor profiles, indoor diurnal profiles from both seasons showed midday peaks, indicating a
likely association with indoor cooking activities. During the dry season, a midday peak occurred around 10-11
am, with concentrations 20-25% higher than-average. In the wet season, a midday peak was observed around 12 pm, with concentrations 15-20% higher-than-average. Late morning and midday are the primary cooking
periods in most homes in Bangladesh65. Lower indoor PM2.5 concentrations were observed in the evening (5-6
pm) during the dry season and early morning (6-7 am) during the wet season when cooking is less likely to

occur.
The diurnal profiles of I/O ratios showed elevated values during midday (12 pm – 2 pm), similar to the indoor
PM2.5 profiles, likely indicating the influence of cooking. Midday peak levels were 22% and 19% higher-thanaverage during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Conversely, lower I/O ratios were observed in the
evening (7-8 pm) during the dry season (18% below the average) and in the morning (6-7 am) during the wet
season (16% below the average). These variations in I/O profiles are influenced by fluctuations in indoor
source activities, outdoor concentration levels, indoor-outdoor air exchange rates, etc. Thus, the observed
profile reflects the influence of a combination of indoor sources, meteorological conditions, and other factors.

dry season. Panels (D), (E), and (F) are similar to (A), (B), and (C), respectively, showing measurements from

3.3 Temporal Relationship and Infiltration Factors
We observed strong temporal correlations between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels across both the dry and wet
seasons. During the dry season, Pearson correlation coefficients (R) between hourly time series of indoor and
outdoor PM2.5 levels measured in individual homes ranged from 0.62 to 0.94, with a mean ± SD of 0.82 ± 0.12.
Similarly, in the wet season, correlations varied from 0.54 to 0.99, with a mean ± SD of 0.83 ± 0.14 (Table 1).
The consistently positive and strong temporal correlation levels further demonstrate the substantial influence of
outdoor PM2.5 levels and meteorological factors on variations in indoor levels.

The derived infiltration factors, represented by slopes from mixed effect regression of indoor and outdoor PM2.5
time series data, also underscore the significant impact of outdoor pollution on indoor environments. During
the dry season, infiltration factors varied between 0.61 to 0.98 (mean ± SD: 0.83 ± 0.12), while during the wet
season, they ranged from 0.53 to 0.98 (mean ± SD: 0.87 ± 0.14). On average, infiltration factors were slightly
higher during the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. This difference may be attributed to variations in
the ventilation conditions of buildings between seasons. For instance, during the wet season, which coincides
with summer in Bangladesh, individuals are more likely to keep their windows open for enhanced ventilation,
thus facilitating greater infiltration of outdoor pollutants into indoor spaces.
The infiltration factors derived from this study tend to be situated towards the upper end of the distribution
reported in the literature6,40,54,57,58,66–68. A review paper54 encompassing 21 studies from the USA and Europe
reported a range of infiltration factors between 0.3 and 0.82. Additionally, a recent study58, utilizing data from
crowdsourced sensors from around 4000 residences across the US, indicated average infiltration factors ranging
from 0.2 to 0.4, with higher values observed during summer/fall and lower values during winter.
Climate conditions exert a significant influence on building structures, ventilation, and human behaviors, all of
which impact the infiltration of outdoor pollution into indoor environments5,54. Compared to Europe and many
locations in the USA that have predominantly colder climate conditions, mechanical ventilation and more
insulated building structures The relatively warmer climate in Bangladesh fosters less insulated building
conditions, increased reliance on natural ventilation, and thus facilitates greater infiltration of outdoor
pollutants into indoor spaces.
The regression intercepts, interpreted as the mean indoor generated source contribution, varied significantly
between homes and seasons (dry season: 19.9 ± 15.4 µg/m3, wet season: 7.7 ± 5.9 µg/m3) (Table 1). Seasonal
variations in indoor sources, meteorological influence, and other factors likely contribute to these differences.
Derived factors indicate that approximately 15-20% of the overall indoor PM2.5 levels come from indoor
generated sources, with the remaining 80-85% contributed by outdoor infiltrations.
While the regression approach employed here is a well-established method in the literature52,54,57,58, it's
important to acknowledge potential challenges in accurately isolating contributions of outdoor infiltration and
indoor generated sources through statistical analysis. However, near unity I/O ratios, consistent seasonal
influence on both indoor and outdoor locations, and strong correlations between indoor and outdoor levels all
support the significant influence of outdoor levels on indoor PM2.5 levels in Dhaka residences. Therefore,
putting these context all together, the derived coefficients from regressions, indicating high outdoor
contributions (80-85%) and relatively small contributions (15-20%) from indoor generated sources, are
physically plausible.
3.4 Spatial Relationship and Factors Affecting Spatial Variability
The Pearson's R between mean indoor and outdoor concentrations across different homes were 0.49 during the
dry season, 0.62 during the wet season, and 0.41 across both seasons. Notably, these correlations are lower than
the temporal correlations observed within individual homes: 0.82 ± 0.12 during the dry season and 0.83 ± 0.14
during the wet season. The moderate spatial correlation suggests that while the among-household variation of
outdoor PM2.5 levels significantly influences indoor levels' spatial variation, other factors, such as indoor source
activities and ventilation-related features, likely play crucial roles in explaining variabilities in indoor PM2.5
levels across homes.
Univariate correlation analysis between indoor PM2.5 levels and various physical features in sampled homes
revealed negative correlations with apartment size (R = -0.33) and the presence of a kitchen hood (R = -0.48),
while positive correlations were observed with the presence of a smoker (R = 0.33) and the use of mosquito
coils (R = 0.17) in the apartment (Table S4). This provides insights into important factors affecting spatial
variability in indoor PM2.5 levels across homes.
Stepwise multiple regression identified outdoor PM2.5, the presence of a kitchen hood in the apartment, and the
number of windows as key predictors, collectively explaining 50-70% of the spatial variability in indoor PM2.5
measured in different households. The multiple linear regression model incorporating these covariates had a fit
12

R2 of 0.78, an RMSE of 7.6 µg/m³, and a CV R2 of 0.52, with an RMSE of 9.6 µg/m³ for overall mean
concentrations across both seasons (Figure S4). Season-specific models revealed similar predictor variables;
however, their model performances were relatively lower (wet season: fit R2: 0.64, CV R2: 0.45; dry season: fit
R2: 0.56, CV R2: 0.40) (Table S5).
The selected predictor variables through stepwise regression and the signs of their coefficients were physically
interpretable. For instance, the presence of a kitchen hood and an increasing number of windows exhibited
negative coefficients, suggesting their potential to decrease indoor PM2.5 levels. In contrast, outdoor PM2.5
showed a positive coefficient, indicating that higher outdoor levels are linked with elevated indoor levels. The
negative association between the increasing number of windows and indoor PM2.5 levels has also been reported
in a past study in a low-income community in Dhaka.28

Our analysis suggests that indoor exposure levels in Dhaka homes can be predicted using outdoor PM2.5 and
indoor activity-related covariates. Implementing the model in unmeasured areas will necessitate estimates of
outdoor PM2.5 levels and other covariates. Outdoor PM2.5 levels can potentially be estimated via a land-use
regression model34,59,60, although its development is beyond this paper's scope. Univariate regression analysis
between measured outdoor PM2.5 and land-use covariates such as restaurant density (R = 0.47), major road
density (R=0.46), and population density (R =0.28) within a 1 km buffer radius shows good associations (Table
S4), suggesting the potential for developing a land-use regression model for outdoor PM2.5 in Dhaka city using
readily available covariates.
3.5 Implications and Future Directions
In this study, we conducted simultaneous measurements of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels across 17 homes in
Dhaka city, Bangladesh, covering both dry and wet seasons. Significant variations in both indoor and outdoor
PM2.5 levels were observed between seasons, primarily driven by regional pollution levels. Our findings
indicate that indoor PM2.5 levels were similar to outdoor levels, with I/O ratios close to 1 across diverse
locations and seasons.
Contrary to the prevalent perception among the general population in Bangladesh that air pollution primarily
exists outdoors, our data indicate that indoor environments in Dhaka city are nearly as polluted as outdoor
settings. Our study provides locally derived scientific evidence to enhance public awareness and develop
mitigation measures for reducing PM2.5 exposures in Bangladesh. Educating the public and policymakers with
scientific evidence is the very first step for implementing evidence-based air pollution interventions.
Our measurements reveal high indoor PM2.5 levels in Dhaka city, akin to outdoor levels, influenced by both
outdoor pollution and indoor sources. This underscores the need for comprehensive and multi-pronged
measures to reduce indoor PM2.5 exposures in Bangladesh. Implementing simple and affordable modification
should serve as initial steps. For instance, our analysis highlights the importance of kitchen hoods and
ventilation in buildings in explaining the spatial variability of indoor PM2.5 across different homes. Awareness
and mitigation measures should be promoted to enhance such practices, including the use of kitchen hoods,
ensuring proper ventilation during and after cooking, and closing windows during periods of high outdoor
pollution levels. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of indoor air filters in reducing indoor
pollution levels69,70. However, given affordability challenges in Bangladesh, locally based low-cost air filter
technology will be essential.

Regional pollution levels play a significant role in indoor pollution in Bangladesh, highlighting the need for
substantial efforts to reduce regional pollution levels. This requires a holistic and long-term clean air program,
currently absent in Bangladesh, which should address pollution from local sources, secondary particulate
pollution, and long-range transported pollution and coordination with neighboring countries14.
While our study provides valuable insights, it has limitations, and further research is needed to enhance our
findings. Future efforts should focus on expanding measurement locations and conducting long-term (yearlong) continuous measurements to better understand indoor and outdoor pollution dynamics. Although our
modeling analysis shows promise in predicting spatial variability in indoor PM2.5 levels using outdoor PM2.5
and indoor physical features as predictor covariates, the statistical model developed based on a limited number
of locations may limit the generalizability of any statistical relationships established. Therefore, future
endeavors should consider incorporating more locations and additional covariates as potential input predictor
variables to strengthen the robustness of relationships. Furthermore, future research should consider size- and
chemically-specific PM2.5 measurements, VOCs, and air toxics for comprehensive air pollution characterization
in diverse rural and urban locations. The combination of comprehensive measurements and modeling analysis
can inform evidence-based mitigation measures and strategies tailored to specific environments.
