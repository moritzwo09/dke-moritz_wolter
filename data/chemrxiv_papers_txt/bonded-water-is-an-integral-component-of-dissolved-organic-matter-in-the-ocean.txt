Abstract
Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean, as one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on
Earth, plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, yet its chemical structure remains largely
unknown. Here we show that high molecular weight DOM (HMW-DOM) contains approximately 10%
bonded water (H2O) by weight. The bonded H2O molecules are an integral part of the DOM organic
complex, likely maintained through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, as the H2O is not released
during freeze drying and barely exchangeable with surrounding H2O in solution. When the bonded H2O
was removed by mild heating (70 °C), the HMW-DOM became more bioavailable as shown by laboratory
incubation experiments. These findings suggest that the bonded H2O plays a key role in regulating the
stability and biogeochemical cycling of DOM in the ocean.

Oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM), containing 660 × 1015 g of carbon (1) as well as other
essential elements, serves as an important reservoir of reduced carbon (C) in the global C cycle and related
biogeochemical processes. Much research has been devoted to investigating the chemical composition of
DOM, aiming to elucidate its sources, transformations, and sinks and thus shed light on reasons for its
long-term stability in millennial timescales. However, unraveling molecular-level structure and
interactions in DOM has been hindered by challenges in isolating and characterizing these organic
molecules (2). To separate oceanic DOM (concentrations typically < 1 part per million) from inorganic
sea salts (at ca. 35 part per thousand), isolation techniques based on molecular size (i.e., ultrafiltration; 3–
6) or physical and chemical properties (i.e., solid phase extraction; 7–9) of DOM have been widely applied,
although the exact molecular level information on different size-fractions, especially the un-extractable
DOM, still remains elusive.
The synergistic integration of cutting-edge techniques, including high-performance separation
(e.g., liquid chromatography), high-resolution spectroscopy (e.g., infrared spectroscopy, mass
spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and mathematical data treatment, has
provided insights into chemical composition, molecular formula, as well as functional groups of DOM
(10). Notably, the combined application of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy has confirmed the existence of structures enriched in carboxyl groups (11) and
carotenoid degradation products (12) in the isolated DOM. However, the mechanisms on how these
structures are assembled and to what extent these structures can represent the total refractory pool of DOM
remain unclear.
An illustrative example highlighting our limited understanding of DOM structure stems from the
discrepancy in DOM molecular weight obtained through ultrafiltration and MS analysis (11, 13), which
has not been reconciled thus far. The combination of ultrafiltration, size exclusion chromatography and
flow field-flow fractionation, has identified a high molecular weight fraction (HMW, size > 1 nm,
molecular weight >1 kDa) in DOM (e.g., 14). However, subsequent high-resolution MS analysis reveals
that the molecular weight of HMW-DOM after ionization is in a small range of 200 – 600 Da, with the
maximum intensity at ca. 400 Da (e.g., 13). Even though it has been proposed that the observed lower
molecular weight range may be a result of ionization or preferential detection with high-resolution MS
(15), the actual molecular weight of the “HMW-DOM” still remains unclear. Alternatively, the seemingly
HMW-DOM may consist of aggregated small molecules (13, 16). These interconnected DOM molecules
may remain integrative during the ultrafiltration process but are disassembled during the electrospray
ionization (ESI) before mass spectrometry analysis.
The concept of assembling small molecules into supramolecules has been proposed in soil science
to explain the chemical structure of humic substances, which are operationally defined as the colored
ubiquitous recalcitrant organic compounds naturally formed from the long-term decomposition of biomass.
While the exact structural characteristics of humic substances remain a topic of debate, two main
hypotheses have emerged (17, 18). Early studies suggested that humic substances consist of
macromolecules with molecular weight in the range of tens to hundreds of kDa, while more recent studies
proposed that humic substances are, in fact, supramolecular mixtures composed of relatively small
compounds held together by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic

interactions (19–22). Notably, H2O molecules have been shown to be a key for the stabilization of the
humic substances, as well as the maintenance of its large apparent molecular size (20, 23, 24).
The role of H2O in shaping the higher-order structures, dynamics, and functions of biomolecules
has long been recognized. For example, H2O helps maintaining the structural integrity of carbohydrates
(e.g., 25, 26). Interactions between carbohydrates and H2O molecules influence the connectivity of
oligosaccharides through competitive intermolecular hydrogen bonding (e.g., 27), and are vital in forming
protein-carbohydrate complexes (e.g., 28). Given that HMW-DOM is enriched with carbohydrate-like
structures (e.g., 29, 30), we hypothesize that a fraction of H2O may be tightly bonded in oceanic DOM,
and affects its higher-order structure and bioavailability.
To test this hypothesis, we applied thermochemical and spectroscopic techniques to determine the
bonded H2O in HMW-DOM and examined how the bonded H2O affected its bioavailability. We
discovered that there are about 10% (by weight) bonded H2O molecules in freeze-dried HMW-DOM from
aquatic environments. These molecules were tightly bonded, preventing readily exchange with ambient
H2O, resembling the phenomenon of “non-freezing” H2O in polymers (31–33). Further incubation
experiments indicated that these bonded H2O molecules slightly increased the recalcitrance of DOM in
seawater. Our findings underscore the crucial role of bonded H2O in dictating intermolecular interactions
within DOM and, consequently, the structural integrity of DOM molecules and their biogeochemical
cycling in the ocean.

The presence of H2O in HMW-DOM. To confirm the presence of H2O in freeze-dried HMW-DOM,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and evolved gas analysis (EGA) coupled with gas chromatography
mass spectrometer (GC-MS) were applied. The TGA result showed that ca. 10% of HMW-DOM (by
weight) was lost at a low temperature range of 25 – 100 ℃. In contrast, only 1% weight was lost for DOM
isolated via solid phase extraction (SPE DOM; 30) during the same heating process (Figure 1A). The
compounds lost during this temperature range were identified by EGA GC-MS. The total ion
chromatogram (TIC) of EGA (Figure 1B, black) resembled the first derivative of TGA (Figure 1A), with
the maximum weight loss rate/maximum components volatilization rate at ca. 100 °C in the low
temperature range. Over 88% (based on ion intensities) of the detected volatile components before 200 °C
have a molecular weight of 18 Da (Figure 1B, red), whereas contributions from other molecular weights
(e.g., 32 and 44) were minimal (Figure S1). Given the relatively low abundance of heavier stable isotopes,
namely 2H and 18O, H2O is the only plausible candidate for the detected peak with a molecular weight 18
Da under electron impact ionization (EI).
There are several possible explanations for the released H2O: (1) residual from an incomplete
freeze-drying process; (2) byproduct produced during the heating process (e.g., through esterification or
Maillard reaction); or (3) intact molecules as part of the intrinsic structure of HMW-DOM but become
volatile when the heating energy is high enough. The first possibility is rejected as the free H2O molecules
should all be sublimed during the 48-hour freeze-drying process (e.g., 34). There was little loss in the
same temperature range when using standard compounds (e.g., glucose, phenylalanine) treated with the
same freeze-drying protocol (Figure S2A – C). Moreover, the incomplete freeze-drying process could not

explain why the TGA results of HWM DOM and SPE DOM differed, since both went through the same
freeze-drying process.
The possibility that H2O is produced from pyrolysis process can be ruled out from the energy
perspective. The pyrolysis of complex mixtures, such as lignin and humic acid, did not show a significant
weight loss in 25 – 100 ℃ (Figure S2D and E), indicating that the released H2O from HMW-DOM was
not newly produced by the heating. In fact, much higher temperature is needed to produce H2O from
chemical reactions. The anoxic pyrolysis of a glucose and phenylalanine mixture (1:1, w/w) hardly show
any weight change until the temperature reached 170 °C (Figure S2F). Particularly, the observed high
reaction temperature here is consistent with previous studies on Maillard reaction, showing a much higher
temperature was required for the dehydration reaction to occur under solid and dry conditions (e.g., 35,
36).
The stability and chemical nature of bonded H2O in DOM. Therefore, the released H2O molecules were
originally stabilized within the HMW-DOM matrix through strong intermolecular forces, i.e., hydrogen
bonding. The presence of intact H2O molecules was further validated through Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. A small band corresponding to D2O (O-D stretching region) was observed
after the HMW-DOM was dissolved in D2O at ca. 50 °C for 8 hours and then freeze-dried (Figure 2). This
result not only confirms the presence of H2O in HMW-DOM, but also indicates a very limited yet
detectable exchange between the bonded H2O molecules in solution D2O, showing that the molecules are
tightly bound even when HMW-DOM is dissolved in solution. Protein-bonded H2O typically exhibits fast
exchange dynamics ranging from pico- to millisecond (37), whereas the HMW-DOM here showed a much
slower and more limited exchanging behavior.
To further examine the exchange capacity of bonded H2O molecules, an exchange experiment was
conducted by dissolving HMW-DOM in D2O at a temperature of 65 ℃ for an extended duration. The
intensity of D2O and H2O from EGA was analyzed to track the exchange process with time. Within the
first 24 h, the D2O/H2O ratio slightly increased from 0.200% to 0.204% (Figure 3), consistent with the
previous FTIR results (Figure 2). However, after this initial increase, the amount of exchanged D2O
remained relatively constant throughout the rest of the experiment. The pattern of D2O exchange can be
depicted by a two-stage function, characterized by a linear increase in the amount of D2O within the first
24 h, followed by a stable D2O/H2O ratio (Figure 3). The observed increase in the D2O/H2O ratio was
rather insignificant (p = 0.50), and the overall small D2O/H2O ratio remained constant over the course of
the experiment. Whether the pattern of the D2O/H2O changes over a longer time scale remains to be
elucidated. Nonetheless, these results confirm that the H2O molecules in HMW-DOM are tightly bonded
and exhibit limited exchange with ambient H2O.
Even though the exact nature of these bonds remains unclear, intermolecular non-covalent
interactions, such as hydrogen bond (H-bond), are the most likely candidate. The bonded H2O in the
HMW-DOM was released in the temperature range of 25 – 100 ℃ (Figure 1A), corresponding to
activation energy of ca. 75 kJ⋅mol-1 (30, 38, 39). This energy level falls into the category of strong or lowbarrier H-bonds, which is a mixture of both partially covalent and strong electrostatic contributions, and
can have energy over 100 kJ⋅mol-1 (40, 41).

These strong H-bonds tend to form between hydroxyl and carbonyl groups (e.g., resonanceassisted H-bonds) or between charged atoms (e.g., charge-assisted H-bonds; 42), whereas moderate or
weak H-bonds are generally formed between uncharged hydroxyl and amide groups (41). The interactions
between H2O molecules and these functional groups can be reflected in the changes of functional groups’
stretching frequencies in FTIR. For instance, the interaction of -OH in H2O with one of the lone electron
pairs of the C=O oxygen atom will increase the polarization of the electron distribution in C=O, leading
to a reduced stretching frequency (i.e., red shift; 43). This phenomenon is observed in the FTIR of HMWDOM. Compared to SPE DOM, which has minimal bonded H2O (Figure 1A), the carbonyl region in
HMW-DOM exhibits a significant red shift from the typical frequency of ca. 1700 cm-1 to ca. 1620 cm-1
(Figure 4A&B), suggesting potential interactions with H2O molecules. In addition, compared with original
HMW-DOM, HMW-DOM with bonded-H2O removed (thereafter as H2O-less HMW-DOM; obtained
through low temperature pyrolysis, see method section for details) indeed showed a slight blueshift in the
carbonyl region (Figure S3). Moreover, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR), which measures
a 2D map of frequency correlations in the sample, provides support to this hypothesis (44–46). Measured
2D IR spectra exhibit a red-shift in the carbonyl groups and coupling between the O-D/O-H vibrations
and –C=O stretching vibrations (Figure S4). Furthermore, the spectra show a high degree of heterogeneity
in the carbonyl frequencies, indicating that there is a broad range of microenvironments. Given that
hydrogen bonding is the primary interaction that shifts the –C=O stretching frequencies, the width of the
features indicates that indeed H2O is likely hydrogen bonded, and that H-bonding leads to a range of
environments. On the other hand, the interactions between H2O molecules and -OH groups in HMWDOM cannot be explicitly observed due to spectral overlap between the O-H stretching vibration.
However, this possibility cannot be ruled out, as SPE DOM, which has little bonded H2O, also shows a
relatively low -OH abundance (Figure 4A). Such coincidence may suggest a connection between H2O and
-OH groups.
Given the relative wide C content ranging from ca. 20% to over 45% for the HMW-DOM (e.g.,
30, 47), the observed 10% H2O by weight equals to 1 H2O molecule for every 4 – 6 C atoms. A
hypothetical structure of a hydrated HMW-DOM molecule is proposed based on our results, with a
molecular weight of 1253 Da (C41H79N3O40) including 7 H2O (Figure 4C). The proposed structure is
consistent with the element stoichiometry of HMW-DOM from NMR results (15, 30, 48, 49). The H2O
molecules are interacting with the O in carboxyl groups, considering that almost all carbonyl O in HMWDOM is in the form of carboxyl and/or amide groups (i.e., little ketone or aldehyde groups; 48, 50), and
the O in hydroxyl groups.
The bonded H2O molecules therefore may change the existing paradigm regarding the molecular
weight distribution of HMW-DOM. From the proposed structure, the molecular size of single “HMWDOM” is relatively small (averaged molecular weight of ca. 376 Da; Figure 4C), yet the aggregated
molecule has an apparent size of over 1200 Da, allowing the assemblage to be retained by ultrafiltration.
During the MS analysis, compounds are ionized through electrospray ionization (ESI). The desolvation
process, which is known as the decrease of droplet size of analytes via heat and Coulomb ﬁssions (51),
may lead to the disruption of H-bonds. Such disruption is especially prominent for supramolecule formed
by smaller molecules, due to the limited number of noncovalently interacting atoms (52). With large

aggregates or assemblages connected through H-bonds disrupted, the molecules detected by the MS will
mainly be the unbonded individual ones with much smaller weight.
A recent study using diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR (DOSY-NMR) estimated a molecular
weight of approximately 5.6 kDa for HMW-DOM collected from ocean surface water (15). Assuming a
similar bonded H2O content of 10%, the molecular weight of 5.6 kDa corresponds to roughly 31 H2O
molecules per HMW-DOM molecule. More studies are needed to find out the reason behind the similarity
between the calculated number of H2O molecules and the average degree of polymerization (DP) for the
acylpolysaccharides (APS) fraction in marine HMW-DOM (35 sugars; 15). Nevertheless, our results do
suggest a significant role of H2O molecules in forming the saccharide network within HMW-DOM.
The impact of bonded H2O on bioavailability of HMW-DOM. To further examine the impact of bonded
H2O molecules on the bioavailability of HMW-DOM, an incubation experiment was conducted. Once the
bonded H2O was removed by heating, HMW-DOM did not re-constitute in solution based on particle size
measurement (Figure S5). During the 60-day incubation, the decrease of DOM in both treatments followed
typical first-order kinetics (Figure 5). An initial decrease in DOC was observed as early as day 1, with no
statistical difference between the original HMW-DOM and H2O-less HMW-DOM during this early stage
(up to day 4; p = 0.25, paired t-test). However, the difference became more pronounced as the incubation
progressed. By day 13, ca. 15% of the initially spiked HMW-DOM was utilized, as compared to
approximately 20% in H2O-less HMW-DOM (p = 0.08, paired t-test). By day 30, 21% of the H2O-less
HMW-DOM was utilized, while 16% of the original HMW-DOM was removed (p = 0.03, paired t-test).
At the end of the incubation (60 days), ca. 80% of original HMW-DOM and 65% of H2O-less HMWDOM remained (p = 1.8 × 10-4, paired t-test; Figure 5). This pattern in DOC dynamics corresponded with
observed changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and microbial abundance (Figure S6). The higher
consumption of DO in H2O-less HMW-DOM incubation (p = 0.04; paired t-test; Figure S6A) aligned with
its higher microbial abundance (Figure S6B) as well as the lower concentration of DOC.
Given that the incubations of HMW-DOM and H2O-less HMW-DOM were conducted under the
same condition, the observed higher bioavailability of the latter therefore can be attributed to the loss of
bonded H2O. The 2D IR results indicated that H2O molecules are primarily bound to the carboxyl groups
in HMW-DOM, thus we hypothesize that the removal of bonded H2O may have exposed the “protected”
interior groups, making them more available to microorganisms. This idea is analogous to the enhanced
decomposition activity observed in soil and sedimentary organic matter following drying and rewetting
(e.g., 53–55). However, this hypothesis needs to be validated with detailed structural information on how
the loss of bonded H2O alters the three-dimensional configuration of HMW-DOM.
Even though this work may be limited by the number of sampling locations, the samples should
be representative, as HMW-DOM from different locations generally shares remarkably similar properties
(e.g., 48, 56–58). We showed that the bonded H2O represents 10% of HMW-DOM by weight, and these
H2O molecules were intermolecularly bonded to DOM molecules through strong H-bonds, with an energy
level of ca. 75 kJ⋅mol-1, causing the connected DOM assemblages to be retained by ultrafiltration. As SPE
DOM barely had any bonded H2O, the weight percentage of bonded H2O molecules in total DOM

molecules is ca. 3%, assuming HMW-DOM represents ca. 30% of total DOM in oceanic waters (59).
These findings shed new light on a longstanding question concerning the size and structure of HMWDOM: rather than single large molecules, the observed “large” size of HMW-DOM in natural waters can
be partially attributed to smaller organic molecules forming assemblages or aggregation (> 1 kDa) through
bonded H2O. This study also revealed that the bonded H2O influenced the bioavailability of DOM. With
H2O stabilizing the supramolecular structure of DOM, the removal of H2O may change the conformation
of HMW-DOM and expose the otherwise inaccessible moieties to microorganisms, leading to the
observed faster decomposition. This work emphasizes the important role of bonded H2O in controlling
the structure of DOM and its biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, a new research avenue that needs to be
further explored.

Materials and methods
Sample collection. Sample collection was described in a previous study (1). Specifically,
water samples were collected from south Texas rivers, including the Guadalupe River (GR; N
28.48°, W 96.86°), Mission River (MR; N 28.29°, W 97.28°), and Nueces River (NR; N 27.88°,
W 97.63°), and one coastal site from a ship channel (SC; N 27.84°, W 97.05°, Port Aransas, Texas)
that is connected to the open Gulf of Mexico (Figure S7). The three river water samples all had a
salinity of < 1‰, representing freshwater DOM, whereas the coastal water sample had a salinity
of ca. 30 ‰, representing marine DOM. An additional HMW-DOM sample was collected from
the Gulf of Mexico (GOM; 28.51°N, 94.19°W) at 2 m depth with a salinity of 35.29‰ (2).
Water samples were collected with the pre-acid cleaned 10-L high-density polyethylene
(HDPE) bottle or 20-L HDPE carboy and stored in a cooler with ice. Upon returning to lab within
the same day, the samples were immediately ﬁltered through in-series ﬁlter cartridges (WhatmanTM
Polycap HD 75 Capsule Filter, 5.0 μm, 2712 M; WhatmanTM Polycap AS 75 Capsule ﬁlter, 0.2 μm,
2706 T) to remove suspended particles. The GOM water sample was directly pumped
peristaltically through a 0.2 µm Nuclepore cartridge (Osmonics) to an ultrafiltration reservoir (3).
Ultrafiltration of the 0.2 µm filtered water (without any pretreatment) was carried out with a spiralwound Amicon S10N1 ultrafiltration cartridge (regenerated cellulose, Millipore), with a nominal
molecule-weight cutoff of 1 kDa. After ultrafiltration, the retentate (reduced from 20 L to 0.5 L)
was further diafiltered with 20 L of ultrapure water to remove residual low molecular weight DOM
and salts (4). The purified HMW-DOM was then freeze-dried (5).
The SPE DOM was obtained from the same water sample following published protocols
(6). Briefly, filtered (0.2 μm) and pre-acidified (pH of 2) water was passed through a methanolconditioned PPL cartridge (Agilent). SPE DOM was eluted from the cartridge with LC/MS grade
methanol. The solvent was then gently blown away with N2 gas, and the SPE DOM was
reconstituted in LC/MS grade water. Powder form of SPE DOM was obtained by freeze-drying
the pre-frozen SPE DOM solution.
D2O exchange experiment. To investigate the dynamics of bonded H2O in HMW-DOM, a
D2O exchange experiment was conducted. Approximately 1 mg of HMW-DOM was dissolved in
2 mL of D2O (99.9% atom% of D; 151882-25G, Sigma-Aldrich) in pre-combusted 20 mL
scintillation bottle, and was placed in an oven maintained at a temperature of ca. 65 °C. At
designated time points (0 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 120 hours after the starting time
point), one bottle was taken out and freeze dried for at least 48 hours to remove the excess D2O.
Freeze dried DOM samples were then analyzed using evolved gas analysis – gas chromatography
mass spectrometry (EGA-GC/MS) to measure the amount of H2O replaced by D2O.
In-lab incubation of HMW-DOM and H2O-less HMW-DOM. In-lab incubations were
conducted to investigate the effect of bonded H2O on the bioavailability of HMW-DOM. The H2Oless HMW-DOM was obtained by pyrolyzing the original HMW-DOM in a thermogravimetric
analyzer (Shimadzu TGA-50). HMW-DOM samples were heated under N2 gas at a flow rate of 50

mL·min-1, with temperature ramping from ca. 25 °C to 70 °C at a ramping rate of 20 °C·min-1, and
was held at 70 °C for 30 min. A pilot experiment confirmed that a 10% – 11% weight loss can be
achieved as early as 8 min, and the weight of HMW-DOM remained constant under 70 °C for over
3 h (Figure S8). To test whether the low-temperature H2O loss in HMW-DOM is reversible, a
fraction of the pyrolyzed HMW-DOM was dissolved in LC/MS grade water, and dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analysis was applied to monitor the change of solute size.
Unfiltered coastal seawater collected at the Ship Channel in Port Aransas, Texas, was used
for incubation. The Ship Channel water has a salinity of 37 ‰, and a background DOC
concentration of ca. 1 ppm. After transferring 150 mL of seawater into pre-combusted 250 mL
amber glass bottle, the bottles were spiked with HMW-DOM or H2O-less DOM to a final
concentration of ca. 10 ppm, ten times higher than the ambient DOC. The setup is in triplicate (i.e.,
three HMW and three H2O-less HMW). The headspace (ca. 120 mL) in the incubation bottle,
together with the initial well-oxygenated water and the aerated sub-sampling, is enough to
maintain oxic for the duration of the incubation. Incubation was carried out under room
temperature (ca. 20 °C). At designated time points (day 0, 1, 2, 4, 13, 30, and 60), 10 mL
subsamples were taken from each incubation bottle and filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate
syringe filter. The filtrates were kept at -20 °C until further dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
analysis with a TOC-L analyzer (Shimadzu). This left each incubation with over half of its initial
volume by the end of the incubation, minimizing the potential effects caused by changing in water
volume.
The incubation was also conducted with low-concentration HMW-DOM in artificial
seawater, which was inoculated with unfiltered Ship Channel seawater at a ratio of 20:1 (7) (data
in Figure S6). The concentrations of HMW-DOM and H2O-less DOM were adjusted to ca. 3 ppm.
Instead of taking subsamples from one large bottle, individual bottles were used for each time
point. In addition to concentrations of DOC, levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and microbial
abundance at each sampling time were also monitored. The headspace of each incubation bottle
was maintained at minimal level to exclude possible interference in DO measurement.
Specifically, at designated time points (day 0, 1, 6, 13, and 48), duplicate bottles of both
HMW-DOM and H2O-less DOM treatments were sacrificed, and measured for their DO with a
Unisense micro-oxygen sensor. One-mL subsample from each incubation bottle was transferred
into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and preserved with 90 μL formaldehyde under 4 °C for microbial
abundance analysis via a C6 flow cytometer (8, 9). The rest samples were filtered through a 0.2
μm cellulose acetate syringe filter. The filtrates were kept at -20 °C until further dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) analysis with a TOC-L analyzer (Shimadzu). Results of the artificial seawater
incubations were included in the Supporting Information.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and evolved gas analysis (EGA). The
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with a thermogravimetric analyzer (Shimadzu
TGA-50). HMW-DOM samples, in ca. 2 mg, were pyrolyzed under N2 gas at a flow rate of 50
mL·min-1, with temperature ramping from room temperature (ca. 25 °C) to 700 °C at a ramping

rate of 20 °C·min-1. The weight of the remaining sample was measured every second, and the
thermograms were generated using the LabSolution software (LabSolutions TA: Acquisition
Version 1.00 SP1).
The evolved gas analysis (EGA) was conducted with a pyrolyzer (EGA/PY-3030D,
Frontier 96 Laboratories Ltd.) coupled with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS;
Shimadzu GCMS-TQ8040). The pyrolysis was conducted under helium (He), and the pyrolyzer
was set to ramp from 50 °C to 650 °C at a constant heating rate of 20 °C·min-1, consistent with the
TGA settings. An Ultra ALLOY EGA tube (ID: 0.15 mm, OD: 0.47 mm, length: 2.5 m; Frontier)
was used and the GC oven was held at 300 °C. The ionization is electron impact ionization (EI).
The mass spectrometer was programed to detect ions with a molecular weight range of 10 – 600
Da. Additionally, a set of specific molecular weights, including 18, 20, 32, and 44, were also
monitored under single ion monitoring mode (SIM). The acquired chromatograms and spectra data
were processed with the LabSolution software (GCMS solution, Version 4.45 SP1, Shimadzu).
FTIR analysis (need input from Dr. Baiz’s group). FTIR spectra were recorded using a
Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. To minimize interference from atmospheric water vapor absorption,
both the spectrometer and sample chamber were purged with dry air throughout the measurements.
Solid samples, of DOM before and after D₂O exchange, were placed between two CaF₂ windows
with a 25 μm Teflon spacer to maintain a consistent path length. All samples were kept at room
temperature. The spectra were collected in the mid-infrared region (4000–400 cm⁻¹) at a resolution
of 4 cm⁻¹, with 64 scans averaged per spectrum. A background scan was measured before each
sample measurement. The spectra are not baseline corrected, and the baselines are not zero due to
scatter of the IR light by the solid DOM samples.
2D IR Spectroscopy. Ultrafast 2D IR spectra were measured using a custom-built pulseshaper-based spectrometer, as previously described (10). In summary, 2D IR measurements
involved excitation (pump) and detection (probe) pulses, both tuned to the carbonyl stretching
region. Pump and probe pulses were centered around 1700 cm-1 with a FWHM of ~300 cm-1.
Coherence times (t1) were scanned up to 3 ps in 20 fs steps using a rotating frame. Spectra were
measured at a waiting time of 150 fs and 500 fs. The probe pulse was dispersed into a 128×128pixel MCT array to generate the detection axis. The polarization was set to perpendicular to reduce
scatter from the sample. The same samples used for FTIR, described above, were measured in the
2D IR spectrometer. The resulting 2D IR spectra display the characteristic positive-negative peak
doublet, representing the ground-state bleach (red contours along the diagonal) and excited-state
absorption (blue contours below the diagonal), as illustrated in Figure S4.

ion chromatogram (TIC; black), compound with molecular weight (MW) of 18 Da (red), 32 Da
(blue), and 44 Da (green). Electron ionization (EI) uses energetic electrons to produce ions from
gas or solid phase atoms or molecules. Therefore, the detected m/z can be considered as the MW
of the volatile compound. The MW of 18, 32, and 44 represent H2O, CH3OH, and CO2,
respectively.

at 150 fs (B) and 500 fs (C), showing fundamental vibrational frequencies of the carbonyl group
in the DOM samples. The diagonal slices of the 2D IR spectra reveal the fundamental vibrational
frequencies of the carbonyl groups in the HMW DOM. The broadening observed along the
diagonal indicates a heterogeneous system, with multiple environments contributing to the
spectral features. The lower wavenumber carbonyl peak, associated with hydrogen-bonded
carbonyl groups, weakens at longer delay times (indicated by the arrow), which can be attributed
to vibrational relaxation.

Figure S5. DLS showing the solute size of H2O-loss DOM. HMW DOM was pyrolyzed at a
relatively low temperature (70 °C) and subsequently re-dissolved it in LC/MS grade water.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed a pronounced reduction in solute size after the
low-temperature pyrolysis, transitioning from a wide size distribution spanning 1 nm to nearly
100 nm (average size of ca. 10 nm) to a much narrower distribution centered around 1 nm.
Notably, no reconstitution of H2O-loss DOM occurred even after 48 hours.

Figure S6. The change of (A) DO, (B) DOC, and (C) microbial abundance in the repeated incubation (inoculation to the artificial
seawater). A higher consumption of DO and a higher bacteria abundance was observed for the H2O-less HMW DOM, supporting the
idea that the removal of bonded H2O increases the bioavailability of HMW DOM, even though the DOC concentrations were quite
similar by the end of incubations between two treatments. The rather similar DOC concentrations may be due to the fact that the DOC
concentration is approaching the detection limit of the instrument.

The three river water samples all had a salinity of < 1‰, representing freshwater DOM, whereas
the coastal water sample had a salinity of ca. 30 ‰, representing marine DOM. An additional
HMW DOM sample was collected from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM; 28.51°N, 94.19°W; not
shown in the map) at 2 m depth with a salinity of ca. 35‰
