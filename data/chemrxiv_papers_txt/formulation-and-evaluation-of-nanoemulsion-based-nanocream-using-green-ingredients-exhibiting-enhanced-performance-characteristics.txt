Abstract-The present study focuses on the formulation and evaluation of a nanoemulsion-based
nanocream using green ingredients, aimed at enhancing performance, stability, and sustainability. The
nanoemulsion was developed through the low-energy phase inversion temperature (PIT) method, which
successfully protected green bioactive compounds like vitamin E, cinnamon oil, jojoba oil, and
peppermint oil from degradation. A series of nanoemulsions were prepared using varying ratios of oils
and surfactants and evaluated for thermodynamic stability, transparency, and droplet size. The optimized
nanoemulsion, with a mean droplet size of 121.3±1.19 nm and a low polydispersity index (PDI) of
0.094±0.001, demonstrated high uniformity and stability. This optimized nanoemulsion was further used
as the cream’s aqueous phase, forming a nanocream that exhibits enhanced permeation of nanoscale
bioactives through a membrane and improved overall performance characteristics. In vitro membrane
permeation studies revealed that the optimized nanocream achieved a permeation rate of 97.15%,
substantially outperforming the control cream. In vitro antimicrobial studies showed comparable
efficacy to standard market preparations containing synthetic agents. The nanocream also demonstrated
long-term stability over six months, maintaining structural integrity without phase separation or
significant changes in pH and spreadability. The nanoemulsion-based nanocream formulated with ecofriendly ingredients hence offers enhanced skin permeation, superior bioactive delivery, and stable
performance, making it a promising candidate for topical skincare and antimicrobial applications.

INTRODUCTION
Nanoemulsions consist of oil droplets dispersed in water, stabilized by surfactants, with droplet sizes
typically ranging from 20 to 200nm—much smaller than those in conventional emulsions. These nanosized droplets enhance the delivery, and bioavailability of water-insoluble drugs and bioactive
compounds, making nanoemulsion-based systems highly effective for drug formulations and cosmetics
[1]. By reducing droplet size, nanoemulsions improve skin penetration, enabling controlled release of
bioactives and providing better therapeutic outcomes for topical applications. Additionally, they offer
improved stability for sensitive ingredients like vitamins and essential oils, making them ideal for
treating skin conditions without causing irritation or allergic reactions often seen with synthetic
compounds [2, 3].
Vitamin E (tocopherol) is well-known for its skin-preserving properties, protecting the skin from
oxidative stress caused by environmental factors like UV radiation and pollution. It also plays a crucial
role in maintaining healthy skin by promoting hydration and aiding wound healing, making it essential
in formulations designed to treat dry and damaged skin [4]. Cinnamon oil, derived from the bark of
cinnamon trees, is recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. It is particularly
effective against acne-causing bacteria and helps reduce redness and irritation, making it an excellent
ingredient for treating various inflammatory skin conditions [5]. Jojoba oil, a well-known emollient,
closely mimics the skin's natural oils, helping to maintain hydration without clogging pores, making it
suitable for acne-prone skin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that soothe irritated skin.
Peppermint oil is widely used for its cooling and soothing effects, helping to alleviate skin irritation and
itching. Additionally, it has antimicrobial properties and can be used to treat skin infections [6]. Natural
waxes like beeswax and cocoa butter are excellent emollients that form a protective barrier on the skin's
surface, helping to prevent moisture loss and promote the healing of dry, cracked skin. Their antiinflammatory and antibacterial properties also help soothe and protect the skin from external irritants
[7].
The development of nanoemulsion-based creams using green technology represents a major
advancement in dermatological formulations [8]. Green technology emphasizes the use of
environmentally friendly processes and ingredients, ensuring that the final product is both sustainable
and safe for long-term use [9, 10]. The nanoemulsion-based nanocream in this study offers several
advantages over traditional skincare products, notably enhancing the bioavailability of poorly soluble
bioactive compounds, which ensures effective skin absorption and therapeutic efficacy [11, 12].
Low-energy emulsification techniques, such as the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method, are used
to develop nanoemulsions. PIT method and other low-energy methods for nanoemulsions are
advantageous, compared to high-energy techniques, especially those containing heat-sensitive
bioactives. High-energy methods utilize mechanical devices to disrupt oil phases, generating heat and
risking the degradation of bioactives. In contrast, low-energy methods rely on the system’s internal

chemical energy, requiring minimal energy input and less expensive equipment [13]. This leads to lower
preparation costs, better sustainability, and reduced risk of damage to sensitive compounds like proteins
and peptides [14]. Additionally, low-energy methods avoid the issues of poor productivity and heatinduced component deterioration associated with high-energy techniques, making them more suitable
for pharmaceutical and food applications [15-16].
The PIT method is a widely used technique for developing nanoemulsions by inducing phase inversion
through temperature changes. In this method, polyethoxylated surfactants, such as Tween 80, which are
hydrophilic at lower temperatures, typically form oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. However, when the
system is heated, the polyoxyethylene groups in these surfactants undergo dehydration, making the
surfactants more lipophilic. As a result, the spontaneous curvature of the surfactant molecules shifts,
leading to the formation of a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. The temperature at which this phase inversion
occurs is referred to as the phase inversion temperature (PIT), also known as the HLB (Hydrophiliclipophilic balance) temperature. To produce a nanoemulsion using the PIT method, the O/W emulsion
system is heated until the phase inversion occurs. Subsequently, the system is rapidly cooled with
continuous stirring, a process called temperature quenching. This cooling reverses the phase inversion,
transforming the system back to an O/W emulsion. The turbulence caused by the rapid temperature
change promotes the formation of nano-sized oil droplets, resulting in a stable O/W nanoemulsion [1719].
Overall, the objective of this research paper is to develop and evaluate a nanoemulsion-based
nanocream formulated with green ingredients, including vitamin E, cinnamon oil, jojoba oil, and
peppermint oil. Using a sustainable and innovative preparation method, this study seeks to harness the
benefits of nanoemulsion technology combined with a cream base to create a nanocream that enhances
overall performance characteristics and antimicrobial efficacy.

Methods
Development of UV-spectrophotometric method for estimation of bioactive oil. A UVspectrophotometric method for vitamin E (Vit E) was developed to estimate the amount of Vit E
permeating through the membrane during in vitro membrane permeation studies of the nanocream. To
achieve this, a calibration curve of Vit E oil in methanol was generated using a UV spectrophotometer,
as described in a previous study [20]. A stock solution of Vit E was prepared in methanol, and five
solutions of varying concentrations (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL) were obtained by appropriate
dilution of the stock solution. The absorbance of each solution was measured at 290 nm in triplicate. The
calibration curve was plotted by graphing absorbance against concentration. The correlation coefficient
and regression equation were determined through regression analysis.
Determination of the phase inversion temperature by turbidity method. When an emulsion system
is heated to its phase inversion temperature (PIT), its appearance changes and becomes turbid. This
occurs because, at elevated temperatures, non-ionic surfactants like Tween 80 undergo dehydration,
causing the oil-in-water emulsion to invert into a water-in-oil emulsion. Therefore, the temperature at
which this visual change occurs is identified as PIT [21-22]. Thus, the PIT of the system was determined
by visual observation of turbidity during heating. To begin, a nanoemulsion was prepared via water
titration, where 5% of an oil mixture (comprising vitamin E, cinnamon oil, jojoba oil, and peppermint
oil in equal proportions) and 25% of a surfactant mixture (Tween 80 and glycerine in a 3:1 ratio) were
combined. Then, 70% distilled water was slowly added to this mixture with continuous stirring, leading
to the formation of a transparent nanoemulsion due to the low oil and high surfactant concentration. The
prepared system was then heated while stirring, and the temperature at which the appearance changed
(turbidity or cloudiness) was observed and PIT was noted. This procedure was repeated three times to
ensure the accuracy of the PIT measurement.
Development of nanoemulsion system by PIT method. The formulation of the nanoemulsion was
carried out using a PIT method to develop an optimal system. The oil phase used consisted of a blend of
30% vitamin E, 30% cinnamon oil, 20% jojoba oil, and 20% peppermint oil, while Tween 80 was chosen
as the primary surfactant. Various ratios of the oil phase and surfactant were tested to achieve the best
nanoemulsion, with the details provided in the Table 1. For the preparation of 10 grams of the
nanoemulsion, the combined oil phase and surfactant were weighed to 1.2 grams (12% of the total
formulation). Additionally, 3.5% glycerine (0.35 grams), 2% cetostearyl alcohol (0.2 grams), and 2.5%
glyceryl monostearate (0.25 grams) were included as co-surfactants to further stabilize the
nanoemulsion.
To begin the formulation, the oil phase was mixed with the surfactant and co-surfactants in a glass vial
and heated to a temperature 10°C above the PIT. In a separate vial, 80% of the total distilled water (8

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hg770 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0912-9008 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

grams) was also heated to 10°C above the PIT. Once both phases were preheated, the water phase was
added to the heated oil and surfactant mixture while stirring continuously at 300 rpm, with the system
maintained at the elevated temperature. Stirring was continued for 10 minutes, during which the system
appeared turbid and inhomogeneous. Following this, the entire system was rapidly cooled to 25°C by
placing the glass vial in ice-cold water, inducing temperature quenching. Stirring was maintained during
this cooling process to ensure proper emulsification, leading to the formation of a transparent and stable
nanoemulsion. A total of 9 nanoemulsion systems with varying ratios of oil phase and surfactant were
prepared.

Evaluation of Developed Nanoemulsion System
Thermodynamic stability testing. The thermodynamic stability of the nanoemulsion formulations was
evaluated through centrifugation and heating-cooling (H/C) cycle tests. In the centrifugation test, each
formulation was subjected to a centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 15 minutes. After centrifugation, the
formulations were visually inspected for any signs of instability, such as phase separation or creaming,
which would indicate poor stability.
For the heating-cooling cycle test, the formulations were alternately exposed to temperatures of 4°C and
45°C, with each cycle lasting 24 hours at each temperature. After completing the cycles, the formulations
were examined for any changes in stability, including phase separation, turbidity, or other signs of
instability. These tests were conducted to ensure the nanoemulsions maintained their structural integrity
under varying conditions.
Determination of transparency of the system by percentage transmittance measurement. The
transparency of the nanoemulsion formulations was assessed by determining the percentage of
transmittance (% transmittance), which provides an indication of droplet size within the nanometer
range. To measure % transmittance, all formulations were first diluted 50 times with distilled water to
ensure accurate readings. The diluted samples were then analyzed using a UV spectrophotometer set at
a wavelength of 650 nm, with distilled water used as a blank reference.
Mean droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI) determination of optimum nanoemulsion
system. The mean droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI) of the optimum nanoemulsion system was
determined using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique with a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments).
To prepare the sample for measurement, the nanoemulsion formulation was diluted 20 times (1:20) with
distilled water to ensure accurate detection of droplet size distribution. The diluted sample was then
analyzed at a scattering angle of 90° and a temperature of 25°C using the Zetasizer. This method
provided detailed information on the average droplet size and the uniformity of the droplet size
distribution (PDI), which are critical parameters for assessing the stability and performance of the
nanoemulsion.

Development of Nanoemulsion-based Nanocream.
The nanocream was developed using a novel approach, incorporating nanoemulsion as the aqueous
phase in the cream formulation as shown in Fig. 1. Nanoemulsion, with its water-like consistency, was
used in place of water, improving the stability of nanosized droplets and reducing the risk of coalescence
of bioactive oils. This is due to the highly viscous and thick nature of the cream’s oily base, which
restricts the movement of nanoemulsion droplets, preventing them from merging [23-25].
For the oil phase of the nanocream, beeswax and cocoa butter were utilized as the cream’s oily
base, while cetostearyl alcohol and glyceryl monostearate served as emulsifiers. The aqueous phase
consisted of the developed optimum nanoemulsion, containing vitamin E, cinnamon oil, jojoba oil, and
peppermint oil, along with glycerine as a humectant. Different ratios of the oil and aqueous phases were
used to prepare six nanocream formulations, as shown in the Table 2.
To begin the nanocream formulation, the ingredients for the oil phase—beeswax, cocoa butter, glyceryl
monostearate, cetostearyl alcohol—were weighed, added to a beaker, and melted while stirring at 65°C.
Simultaneously, in a separate beaker, the aqueous phase, comprising the developed nanoemulsion and
glycerine, was heated to 55°C, a temperature well below the PIT of the nanoemulsion. The preheated
aqueous phase was then slowly added to the preheated oil phase with continuous stirring while gradually
cooling the mixture to room temperature. The cooling process was conducted slowly to ensure a smooth
emulsion. After the complete addition of the aqueous phase to the oil phase, stirring and cooling were
continued until a homogeneous and viscous nanocream was formed. This will lead to the development
of an oil-in-water nanocream.
Impact of nanoemulsion utilization as the aqueous phase in cream formulation. To examine the
effect of using nanoemulsion as the aqueous phase in cream formulation, two additional cream
formulations were prepared for comparison. These formulations were designed to assess the role of
nanoemulsion in enhancing the stability and performance of the cream.
In the first formulation (C1), water was used in place of nanoemulsion as the aqueous phase,
while the oil phase composition remained identical to the optimum nanocream formulation among the
six previously developed nanocreams. This allowed for a direct comparison of the effect of replacing
the nanoemulsion with water in the cream formulation. Similarly in the second formulation (C2), again
water was used as the aqueous phase; however, to compensate for the absence of the surfactant Tween
80, which was present in the nanoemulsion, Tween 80 was added to the oil phase. Since Tween 80 is an
excellent emulsifier, its inclusion ensured that the emulsifying properties of the formulation were
maintained even without the nanoemulsion. Both formulations were prepared using the same method as
previously described.

Evaluation of Developed Nanocream
Physical appearance and pH of nanocream. The organoleptic characteristics of all nanocream
formulations were evaluated through visual observation and tactile assessment. The color, texture,
homogeneity, and any signs of phase separation were examined by inspecting the appearance of each
formulation. To further assess homogeneity and texture, a small amount of nanocream was pressed and
rubbed between the thumb and index finger. This allowed for the evaluation of immediate skin feel,
including sensations of stiffness, grittiness, greasiness, and overall smoothness. For the pH
determination, one gram of each nanocream formulation was dispersed in 25 mL of distilled water. The
pH of the resulting dispersion was measured using a calibrated pH meter to ensure the formulations were
suitable for topical application and within the desired pH range for skin compatibility.
Stability determination by centrifugation test. To evaluate the stability of the oil-in-water (O/W)
nanocream formulation against creaming, a centrifugation test was conducted. Creaming is a common
instability reaction in O/W emulsions, where the dispersed oil phase may separate and rise to the top,
forming a layer of oil droplets. This test helps to confirm that the developed nanocream is stable, wellemulsified, and homogenous [26].
For the centrifugation test, 5 grams of nanocream were placed in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at
3500 rpm for 20 minutes. After centrifugation, the nanocream was carefully inspected for any signs of
creaming, phase separation, or visible layers of oil droplets. The absence of these signs would indicate
that the nanocream has good stability and resistance to creaming under accelerated conditions.
Spreadability determination. To determine the spreadability of the nanocream, a sample weighing 1
gram was placed at the center of a square glass plate (dimensions: 10 cm × 20 cm). A second, identical
glass plate was carefully placed on top of the nanocream, and a 1.5 kg weight was applied at the center
for 1 minute to allow the nanocream to spread between the plates. After the designated time, the plates
were separated, and the spread diameter of the nanocream was measured in four different directions:
vertical, horizontal, and two diagonals. The average of these four measurements was calculated to obtain
the final Spreadability reading, ensuring an accurate representation of the nanocream’s spreading
capacity. The spreadability of the nanocream was compared to that of a commercial moisturizing cream,
Monange® (manufactured by Savoy Industria de Cosmeticos, Goiania, Brazil).
In vitro membrane permeation studies of nanocream. For the in vitro membrane permeation study,
the optimum nanocream formulation was evaluated and compared with the normal cream formulation
(C2), where no nanoemulsion was used as the aqueous phase. The permeation study employed the
dialysis bag method [27]. A dialysis membrane (Dialysis membrane-150; LA401-5MT; average flat
width 42.44 mm and average diameter 25.4 mm, HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) was activated

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hg770 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0912-9008 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

by immersing it in distilled water for 24 hours. After activation, one end of the dialysis membrane was
securely tied with a thread. Five grams of the nanocream formulation were then loaded into the dialysis
membrane through the other end, which was subsequently tied to ensure no leakage occurred. The sealed
dialysis bag, containing the nanocream, was submerged in 500 mL of distilled water at a controlled
temperature of 37°C. The system was stirred continuously at 200 rpm. At specified time intervals (30
min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, etc.), 5 mL samples were withdrawn from the beaker. After each withdrawal, an
equivalent volume of distilled water was added to maintain sink conditions. The collected samples were
filtered, diluted with methanol, and analyzed for the permeation of vitamin E using a UV spectrometer
at 290 nm, calibrated against a standard curve of vitamin E in methanol. In parallel, the permeation study
was conducted on the normal cream (C2) using the same procedure, and the results were compared with
those of the optimum nanocream.
Determination of in vitro antimicrobial activity of nanocream. To evaluate antibacterial activity
using the well diffusion assay, Nutrient Agar (28 g) was dissolved in 1 litre of distilled water and
sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C under 15 lbs pressure for 15 minutes. The sterilized media was poured
into plates and allowed to solidify under laminar airflow. A bacterial suspension of E. coli and S. aureus
(108 CFU/mL) was prepared and standardized. A 100 µl aliquot of the bacterial inoculum was spread
evenly across the surface of each solidified agar plate using a sterile spreader. Two wells, each 6 mm in
diameter, were created in the agar using a sterile cork-borer. One well was filled with the optimum
nanocream, and the other with a standard ointment (Veldine-OZ containing 5% w/w povidone-iodine
and 1% w/w ornidazole ointment manufactured by Valentis Pharma). Plates were left at room
temperature for 30 minutes to allow diffusion and then incubated at 37°C for 18-24 hours. After
incubation, the zones of inhibition (ZOI) were measured in millimetres, including the diameter of the
well, using a ruler placed on the inverted Petri dish against a black background. The clear zones around
the wells indicated the antimicrobial activity of the tested compounds. Minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth dilution method with two-fold serial dilutions in
nutrient broth medium, following procedures described in previous studies [28-29].
Evaluation of nanocream surface charge via zeta potential analysis. To evaluate the surface charge
of the nanocream, 1 gram of the optimum nanocream sample was diluted 200-fold by dispersing it into
200 mL of distilled water. The mixture was then shaken thoroughly and stirred to ensure homogeneous
dispersion of the nanodroplets. After thorough mixing, the dispersion was filtered to remove any large
particles from the cream base. The surface charge of the nanodroplets was then determined by measuring
the zeta potential using a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments). This measurement provides insight into the
electrostatic stability and surface characteristics of the nanocream.

Long term stability testing of nanocream. To evaluate the long-term stability of the optimum
nanocream formulation, the product was subjected to a storage stability study. The formulated
nanocream was carefully packed in a glass beaker and stored at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) for a period
of six months. Over this duration, any potential instability mechanisms were monitored, including
changes in physical appearance, spreadability, pH, and phase separation. After the six-month storage
period, the nanocream was reevaluated for these parameters. Physical appearance was visually inspected
to note any alterations in texture, color, or homogeneity. Phase separation was assessed by observing
any distinct layers that may have formed, indicating instability. The pH of the formulation was measured
by dispersing a small sample in deionized water and using a calibrated pH meter. Lastly, spreadability
was determined using a glass plate method to quantify any changes in the ease of application compared
to its initial state. These tests provided valuable insights into the formulation's ability to retain its original
properties over time, ensuring its long-term stability and effectiveness

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Development of UV- spectrophotometric method for estimation of bioactive oil. In calibration curve
of Vit E in methanol, linearity ranges from 10 to 100 μg/mL in methanol with a correlation coefficient
(r) of 0.996. The regression equation was found to be Y=0.0062x + 0.1995. (Fig. 2).
Evaluation and selection of optimum nanoemulsion formulation. A total of nine nanoemulsion
systems were developed by varying the ratios of the oil phase and surfactant. These formulations were
evaluated based on their thermodynamic stability and transparency to select the optimum nanoemulsion
system for further use in nanocream formulation. The results of the thermodynamic stability tests and
the transparency evaluation are presented in the Table 3. Among the nine formulations, NE9, NE8, NE7,
and NE6 exhibited a transparent to translucent appearance, indicative of nanosized droplets [30]. NE6
was selected as the optimum nanoemulsion formulation due to its superior composition, which included
a higher proportion of bioactive oils and a lower surfactant concentration compared to NE9, NE8, and
NE7. Additionally, NE6 demonstrated thermodynamic stability as well.
Further the evaluation of NE6 revealed a mean droplet size of 121.3±1.19 nm (Mean ± SD; n=3) and a
PDI of 0.094±0.001 (Mean ± SD; n=3). The nano size droplet confirms its classification as a
nanoemulsion, while the relatively low PDI value reflects a high degree of monodispersity, indicating
uniform droplet size distribution. This uniformity is a desirable characteristic for the nanoemulsion
system [31-32].
Thus, NE6 nanoemulsion formulation was chosen as the optimum nanoemulsion and further used for
the formulation of nanocream.

Evaluation and selection of optimum nanocream formulation. The results of the evaluation of all six
nanocream formulations are presented in the Table 4. Each formulation exhibited good emulsification
and homogeneity, with no signs of grittiness. The successful emulsification was further supported by the
centrifugation test, in which all formulations demonstrated stability, with no phase separation. The pH
values of all nanocreams ranged within the normal skin pH range, suggesting minimal risk of skin
irritation upon application. It was observed that formulations with an oil phase exceeding 30% and an
aqueous phase below 65% were thick and hard in texture. Additionally, a slight increase in pH was noted
as the total oil phase increased.
The spreadability of the nanocreams was compared to that of a commercial moisturizing cream
(Monange® by Savoy Industria de Cosmeticos, Goiania, Brazil). Among all formulations, NC4 had a
spreadability value closest to the commercial cream, indicating that NC4 has optimal spreadability,
which would enhance ease of application on the skin. Based on this evaluation, NC4 was selected as the
optimum nanocream formulation. In NC4, the total nanoemulsion used as the aqueous phase was 66%,
allowing for the incorporation of significant quantities of bioactive oils: 891 mg of vitamin E, 891 mg
of cinnamon oil, 594 mg of jojoba oil, and 594 mg of peppermint oil as nanosized droplets (in 66 g of
total nanoemulsion as aqueous phase) in 100 grams of nanocream.
Effect of using nanoemulsion as aqueous phase in nanocream formulation. To evaluate the impact
of incorporating nanoemulsion as the aqueous phase in the nanocream formulation, two additional cream
formulations C1 and C2 were prepared using the composition of the optimum nanocream (NC4), as
detailed in the Table 5. The evaluation results are presented in the Table 6. When water alone was used
as the aqueous phase in C1, the formulation failed to emulsify, resulting in an unstable cream that could
not form properly. This indicates that cetostearyl alcohol and glyceryl monostearate alone were
insufficient to emulsify 70% of the aqueous phase in the cream. However, when 5% Tween 80 was
added along with water in the C2 formulation, the cream emulsified successfully, though it lacked
homogeneity and displayed small, soft lumps compared to the smoother NC4 formulation. This
demonstrates that the presence of Tween 80 in the nanoemulsion not only reduced the size of bioactive
oil droplets to the nanoscale but also facilitated the emulsification of two phases of cream, contributing
to a smoother and more homogenous cream. Thus, the use of nanoemulsion as the aqueous phase, with
Tween 80 playing a dual role, significantly improves the texture, emulsification, and overall quality of
the nanocream formulation.
Overall, the NC4 nanocream formulation was selected as the optimum formulation based on its superior
emulsification, homogeneity, and spreadability. It was further evaluated for in vitro membrane
permeation studies, in vitro antimicrobial activity long term stability and other characteristics, to confirm
its enhanced performance and potential for therapeutic effectiveness.

In vitro membrane permeation studies of nanocream. The results of the in vitro membrane
permeation study comparing the optimum nanocream formulation (NC4) with the normal cream
formulation (C2) are illustrated in the Fig. 3. It was observed that the permeation of bioactive oil Vit E
through the dialysis membrane was significantly higher for the nanocream (NC4) than for the normal
cream (C2). At the end of the 10-hour study, the NC4 nanocream demonstrated a permeation rate of
97.15 ± 2.33% (Mean ± SD; n=3), whereas the C2 cream showed only 62.46 ± 2.18% (Mean ± SD; n=3)
permeation. This substantial difference in permeation between the two formulations can be attributed to
the nanosized droplets in the NC4 nanocream, which allow for more efficient penetration through the
membrane. These findings suggest that the nanoscale structure of the nanocream significantly improves
its delivery potential, pointing to enhanced therapeutic effectiveness in comparison to conventional
cream formulations. The superior in vitro permeation performance of the NC4 nanocream indicates its
potential for better skin absorption and efficacy in practical applications.
In vitro antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nanocream. The
antibacterial activity of the optimum nanocream formulation (NC4) and the standard ointment was
assessed using the well diffusion assay (Fig.4). The results showed that the nanocream exhibited
significant antibacterial effects against both E. coli and S. aureus. The zones of inhibition were measured
at 16.33±4.16 mm for E. coli and 29.33±4.73 mm for S. aureus, indicating that the formulation had
strong antibacterial properties (Table 7). To further investigate its efficacy, the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) test was performed to determine the lowest concentration at which the formulation
could inhibit bacterial growth. For E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, the MIC of the nanocream
formulation was determined to be 62.5 μg/mL, while for S. aureus, a gram-positive bacterium commonly
associated with skin infections, the MIC was found to be lower at 31.25 μg/mL (Table 8). The study
concluded that the antimicrobial efficacy of the developed nanocream was comparable to that of the
standard market preparations containing synthetic agents, making it a promising candidate for treating
bacterial skin infections.
The observed superior antibacterial activity of the developed nanocream against S. aureus compared to
E. coli can be attributed to the simpler cell wall structure of S. aureus, which contains a thick
peptidoglycan layer. This structural feature makes it easier for the bioactive compounds in the
nanocream to interact with and penetrate the cell wall of S. aureus. In contrast, E. coli has a more
complex outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides, which may act as a barrier, reducing the accessibility
of bioactive ingredients [33]. Nevertheless, the nanocream still demonstrated significant antibacterial
activity against E. coli, indicating its potential for broad-spectrum antimicrobial applications.
The development of a nanoemulsion-based nanocream has enhanced the efficacy of green bioactive
ingredients. The smaller droplet size of the nanocream increases the surface area available for interaction
with bacterial cells, thereby improving the absorption and penetration of bioactive compounds into

deeper layers of the skin [34]. This is especially beneficial for targeting skin pathogens [35].
Furthermore, the use of green technology in the formulation offers a safer and environmentally friendly
alternative to synthetic antimicrobial agents, meeting the growing consumer demand for natural and
sustainable skincare solutions. Overall, the nanocream formulation has shown promising broadspectrum antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli.
Nanocream surface charge and impact on skin barrier function: The zeta potential of the optimum
nanocream (NC4) was measured at -23 mV, indicating that the nanodroplets in the formulation possess
a negative surface charge. This negative charge is beneficial for enhancing the skin's barrier function.
Negatively charged particles can strengthen the skin's physical barrier by forming an occlusive layer on
the surface of the stratum corneum, which reduces trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) and aids in skin
moisturizing [36]. Additionally, the negative charge of the particles supports the recovery of a disrupted
skin barrier, further promoting skin repair [37]. These findings suggest that the developed nanocream
not only aids in moisturizing but also plays a role in repairing and protecting the skin barrier.
Long term stability testing of nanocream. The long-term stability of the selected optimum nanocream
formulation NC4 was assessed after storing it at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) for a period of six months.
The results of the stability study, summarized in Table 9, demonstrated that the formulation maintained
its stability throughout the six-month duration. Notably, there were no signs of phase separation, and the
nanocream exhibited a homogeneous appearance. Furthermore, measurements indicated that there were
no significant changes in pH, suggesting that the formulation's integrity was preserved. Additionally, the
spreadability of the nanocream remained consistent with the initial measurements. These findings
collectively indicate that the novel nanoemulsion-based nanocream is stable for long-term storage,
affirming its potential for practical applications in skincare.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, a nanoemulsion-based nanocream was successfully formulated using natural and
sustainable ingredients. An optimum nanoemulsion with nanosized droplets of bioactive oils and high
uniformity was first developed. This nanoemulsion was then used as the aqueous phase in the nanocream
formulation. The resulting nanocream demonstrated enhanced bioactive permeability, superior
spreadability, homogeneity, consistency, comparable antimicrobial activity with synthetic agents,
indication of enhanced skin barrier function and long-term stability. The use of the low-energy phase
inversion temperature method for nanoemulsion preparation preserved the green ingredients,
contributing to the overall efficacy of the formulation, while reducing preparation costs. This novel
approach of incorporating nanoemulsion as the aqueous phase in cream formulations shows promise for

developing stable nanocream with improved performance characteristics, paving the way for future
applications in skin care, cosmetic, and dermatological products.
