Abstract

24

Ammonia-selective adsorbents can manage reactive nitrogen in the environment and

25

promote a circular nutrient economy. Weak acid cation exchangers loaded with zinc exhibit high

26

ammonia selectivity but face two implementation barriers: the stability of the zinc-carboxylate

27

bond in complex wastewaters and energy- and logistics-intensive adsorbent regeneration with

28

acidic solutions. In this study, we examined the stability of the zinc-carboxylate bond in varying

29

solutions (pure ammonium solution, synthetic urine, and real urine) and during electro-assisted

30

regeneration. For electrochemical regeneration, both electrolyte concentration and current density

31

influenced the tradeoff between ammonia regeneration and zinc elution. Using 10 mM K₂SO₄

32

anolyte at 0.08 mA/cm² current density, we achieved 4% zinc elution and 61% ammonia

33

regeneration. In contrast, using 100 mM K₂SO₄ at 4.96 mA/cm² improved regeneration efficiency

34

to 97% but eluted 60% of zinc. We found that the electrolyte concentration was the key factor

35

influencing the regeneration efficiency of NH₃-selective adsorbents. Due to prevalent zinc elution,

36

we designed an in-situ procedure for reforming the zinc-carboxylate bond and achieved similar

37

adsorption densities between pre- and post-regenerated resin, thus enabling multiple cycle resin

38

use. Ultimately, this study advances the understanding of ammonia-selective resins that can

39

facilitate high-purity, selective, and durable nutrient recovery from waste streams.

Introduction

45

Anthropogenic discharges (e.g., untreated wastewater and fertilizer runoff) have led to an

46

imbalance of reactive nitrogen such as ammonium (NH4+), ammonia (NH3), and nitrate (NO3-) in

47

the environment. This imbalance has caused eutrophication, monetary loss from impacted

48

recreation and tourism, and detrimental human health effects.1,2 The Haber-Bosch process, which

49

converts inert atmospheric N2 to ammonia for fertilizers, is a major contributor to this nitrogen

50

imbalance and its environmental implications. This catalytic nitrogen fixation uses 1% of the

51

world’s total energy production and produces 1.4% of global CO2 emissions.3 In contrast,

52

exploring alternative nitrogen sources, such as wastewater, can reduce the dependency on Haber-

53

Bosch derived fertilizers by recovering and repurposing reactive nitrogen. For example, urine

54

accounts for 80% of the total nitrogen but only 1% of the volume in wastewater and contains

55

concentrated levels of NH3-nitrogen (often above 3,000 mg N/L).4 To promote a more sustainable

56

nutrient economy and safeguard the environment from harmful algal blooms, effective

57

management of reactive nitrogen species is necessary.

58

Contemporary nutrient mitigation techniques (e.g., biological methods, chemical

59

precipitation) prioritize nutrient removal over recovery to satisfy the stringent discharge

60

requirements of wastewater treatment plants. Nutrient recovery from urine could reduce nutrient

61

removal costs (e.g., decreased sludge production) and provide supplemental fertilizers (e.g.,

62

struvite from phosphorus recovery, ammonium sulfate from recovery).5 Ion exchange (IX) resins

63

are a viable approach for the effective management and recovery of nutrients from waste streams.

64

Specifically, weak acid cation (WAC) exchange resins have potential as a low-cost, low-energy,

65

modular technique for ammonium (NH4+) recovery from urine by facilitating electrostatic binding

66

of NH4+ to carboxylate functional groups.6,7 However, in real urine applications, WAC resins show

67

a maximum NH4+ adsorption capacity of 6 mmol N/g resin due to limited selectivity in

68

multicomponent wastewaters containing competing cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+).8,9

69

Electrostatically loading zinc ions onto commercial WAC IX resins enhances selectivity towards

70

total ammonium nitrogen (i.e., the sum of NH4+ and NH3, or TAN) through inner-sphere ammonia-

71

zinc interactions, which enable an intrinsic TAN/K+ selectivity of 10.1 (up to ten times higher than

72

commercial resins).10 Ex-situ regeneration of these NH3-selective resins with mild commercial

73

acids (pH 3.25 to 4.25) achieved high TAN recovery (>90%).10 While these achievements are

74

promising, chemical regeneration with commercial acids and bases limits implementation in water

75

treatment systems. Producing chemical regenerants, such as sulfuric acid for cation exchange

76

resins, accounts for up to 70% of treatment greenhouse gas emissions and energy input for

77

adsorptive nitrogen recovery from wastewater.11 To better justify the use of adsorbents for water

78

treatment, nutrient technologies must mitigate the external chemical usage needed for

79

regeneration.

80

Electro-assisted regeneration of IX resins could lower the emissions and energy input for

81

chemical regeneration; however, in-situ electro-assisted regeneration of ammonia-selective

82

adsorbents is underdeveloped. Electro-assisted regeneration uses either the acidic anode solution

83

from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for cation exchange resins or the alkaline cathode

84

solution from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for anion exchange resins (Figure S1).12 An

85

electrochemical-ion exchange (EC-IX) system integrating resin inside the reactor can facilitate in-

86

situ regeneration of IX resins and simultaneous recovery of high-purity TAN. Our research group

87

has validated the in-situ electrochemical regeneration of commercial WAC resins as an effective

88

technique for tandem regenerant production, resin regeneration, and nitrogen recovery.13 Although

89

ex-situ nitrogen recovery using NH3-selective resins has been examined with commercial

90

acids10,14, in-situ analysis of NH3-selective resins regenerated with electrochemically generated

91

acids remains unexplored. More specifically, informed implementation requires exploration of

92

how mild electrochemically generated acids protonate adsorbed ammonia while maintaining the

93

zinc-carboxylate bond to minimize metal elution.

94

Nutrient recovery from NH3-selective resins relies on maintaining the zinc-carboxylate

95

bond during metal-ammine adsorption in wastewater and subsequent electrochemical

96

regeneration. Bond breakage and zinc elution can occur due to outer-sphere competition with

97

cations, inner-sphere competition from ligands, and protonation of the resin moieties under acidic

98

conditions.10,14 Zinc elution limits the effectiveness of NH3-selective resins by reducing the

99

quantity of sites available for NH3 adsorption. Furthermore, zinc elution can enhance effluent metal

100

concentrations and thus pose environmental hazards, detrimental human health effects, and metal

101

mitigation costs.15–17 A monovalent-selective membrane could prevent zinc transport and

102

precipitation into the cathode chamber and allow for potential zinc reloading onto the resin. This

103

membrane structure can prevent Zn2+ contamination of the aqueous ammonia product and maintain

104

current efficiency within EC-IX systems. Systematically understanding operating conditions and

105

system configurations is crucial for enhancing large-scale implementation of emerging nutrient

106

recovery technologies.18 Therefore, conducting in-situ analysis on electrochemically regenerating

107

NH3-selective resins can advance their integration and feasibility in wastewater treatment.

108

The objective of this study was to investigate the electro-assisted regeneration of NH3-

109

selective resins in an EC-IX system, with the goal of understanding the tradeoffs between zinc

110

elution and ammonia recovery. We investigated nutrient recovery across ammonia adsorption

111

solutions and electrochemical regeneration in an EC-IX cell with anodic NH3 protonation to NH4+

and migration into an acidic cathodic chamber. Our main objectives were to: (1) determine how

113

different ammonia adsorption conditions (pure ammonium solution, synthetic urine, and real urine)

114

affect zinc elution and overall ammonia recovery, (2) examine the operating parameters (applied

115

current, electrolyte composition, and TAN concentration) that maximize nutrient recovery while

116

preventing zinc-carboxylate bond breakage, and (3) investigate the in-situ formation of zinc-

117

carboxylate bonds to manage zinc elution. Improved mechanistic understanding of how the

118

solution environment and electrochemical parameters influence ammonium recovery will advance

119

nutrient separation and electrochemical recovery technologies and guide real-world

120

implementation into wastewater treatment systems.

134

Ion Exchange Resin Metal Loading

135

We modified a macroporous hydrogen-form weak acid cation exchange resin (Dowex Mac 3,

136

Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) into a zinc-carboxylate resin to enhance ammonia selectivity using

137

two-step ion exchange (from R-H+ to R-Na+ to R-Zn2+).10,14 Zn2+ was chosen for metal-ammine

138

resins over other metals because it exhibited high selectivity towards NH3 and intermediate binding

139

affinity amenable to both NH3 adsorption and regeneration.20–22 We used a two-step exchange to

140

accurately measure both Zn2+ uptake and Na+ removal with IC.

141

We placed 100 mL of neat hydrogen-form resin in 2 L of 1 M NaHCO3 for 24 hours to

142

completely exchange protons with Na+. As protons entered the solution, carbonic acid formed and

143

rapidly decomposed in water to form H2O and gaseous CO2, which bubbled out of solution and

144

thus increased solution pH.23 We conducted this exchange for 24 hours until bubble formation

145

ceased, indicating Na+ adsorption was complete.

146

Column experiments were used to modify sodium-loaded resins into zinc-loaded resins. 100

147

mL of sodium-loaded resin was placed into a cylindrical plastic column (200 mL volume, 1/4”

148

inner diameter, 1’ length, Spears Manufacturing, Sylmar, CA) and 6 L of 0.2 M ZnCl2 solution

149

was pumped at 3 mL/min for 72 hours using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex C/L, Vernon Hills,

150

IL). Finally, we conducted batch adsorption with 1 L of 0.2 M ZnCl2 solution for 24 hours to ensure

151

complete Zn2+ loading. Resins were washed with nanopure water (resistivity 18.2 mΩ·cm at 25

152

°C, Millipore Milli-Q System, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) to remove any residual ZnCl2

and the wash solution was tested on IC to ensure Na+ levels were below the detection limit of 3

154

nM.

155

Ammonia Loading

156

To elucidate the difference in ammonia selectivity in increasingly complex TAN-

157

containing solutions, we used three adsorption solutions (full composition in Table S1): a pure

158

ammonium solution containing 500 mM TAN (320 mM NH3 as NH4OH and 180 mM NH4+ as

159

NH4Cl), a synthetic urine solution containing 230 mM TAN, and real hydrolyzed urine with 340

160

mM TAN. All adsorption solutions besides the real urine were prepared with nanopure water and

161

reagent-grade chemicals purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). We collected real urine

162

from consenting adults in the Shriram Center for Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering at

163

Stanford University (Internal Review Board Protocol 60601). We first explored the effect of resin

164

mass per solution volume on the ratio of ammonia adsorbed to zinc eluted, which compares the

165

benefits of selective TAN recovery to the risks of adsorbent degradation. We used an isochoric

166

process for the adsorption solution tests for the synthetic and hydrolyzed urine with 5 mL of

167

solution and varying resin mass (10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg

168

resin/mL solution). Generally, we used 5 mL tubes for initial adsorption tests to minimize

169

headspace and ammonia volatilization; because higher resin masses required larger volumes, 750

170

and 1000 mg resin/mL adsorbate were conducted in 10 mL tubes. The ideal resin to solution ratio

171

(i.e., resin dose) for a pure TAN solution (75 mg resin/mL solution) was chosen because our

172

previous work indicated the ratio exhibited preferential TAN adsorption with minimal zinc elution

173

(<1%).14 Preliminary experiments showed that 8 hours was adequate for reaching equilibrium

174

because the measured adsorption density was the same as for 24-hour experiments. Thus, we

conducted 8-hour experiments and took 1-mL aliquots were taken for IC analysis and pH

176

measurement.

177

Three metrics were used to evaluate resin performance: removal efficiency (% removalA),

178

adsorption density (qf), and NH3 adsorbed/Zn2+ eluted ratio.

179

Equation 1 defines the removal efficiency of each adsorbate in mmol/L (A = TAN, Zn2+, K+, or

180

Na+). C0,A is the initial concentration and Cf,A is the final concentration at equilibrium (adsorption

Electro-assisted Regeneration of NH3-Selective Resin

195

We performed chronopotentiometry experiments to demonstrate that a proof-of-concept

196

two-chamber EC-IX system could regenerate ammonia-saturated resins while minimizing zinc

197

elution (Figure 1a). The anode was a titanium mesh coated with iridium mixed metal oxide (6

198

cm2, Magneto Special Anodes, Netherlands) and the cathode was solid stainless steel (6 cm2, 316

199

stainless steel, Small Parts, Plymouth, MI).11,13,24,25 The reactor was secured by two hollow Perspex

200

plates (10.2 × 1.2 × 5.3 cm3) bolted between two solid Perspex plates (10.1 × 1.3 × 8.7 cm3) to

201

create two 12-mL chambers. For all regeneration tests, 5 mL (~4.9 g) of ammonia-saturated resins

202

were packed in the anode chamber of the EC-IX. This resin volume prevented direct contact with

203

the anode and potential degradation from direct oxidation. Regeneration experiments were

204

conducted in triplicate using the same batch of ammonia-saturated resin for reproducibility.

205

Equation 4 defines the regeneration efficiency γ (%) where Mads is moles of NH3 adsorbed onto

206

resin, and Manode and Mcathode are moles of TAN detected in each respective chamber.

solutions (K2SO4 for the anolyte and KCl + 100 mM H2SO4 for the catholyte) at 40 mL/min with

211

a peristaltic pump (Masterflex C/L, Vernon Hills, IL). Catholyte solutions for regeneration

212

experiments contained 100 mM H2SO4 to prevent Zn(OH)2 precipitation observed in preliminary

213

experiments. We used a putatively monovalent-selective cation exchange membrane (CMS,

214

Ameridia Inc., Napa, CA) to separate the anolyte and catholyte chambers. Monovalent-selective

215

membranes use size exclusion to block divalent ions from transporting through the membrane

216

matrix.26–28 K+ was chosen as the electrolyte cation because it exhibits sufficient peak separation

217

with NH4+ for reproducible IC measurements. Sulfate was chosen due to its abundance in the

218

environment and stability in anodic conditions, while chloride was chosen due to its environmental

219

abundance and stability in cathodic conditions.29,30 Anolyte and catholyte concentrations were

220

always matched (both 10 mM or both 100 mM) to examine concentration effects on regeneration

221

efficiency and energy consumption. Zinc eluted during regeneration was recorded during each

222

sampling point. To examine the influence of OER on EC-IX performance, we applied two current

223

densities (0.08 mA/cm2 and 4.96 mA/cm2) for 6-hour experiments using a potentiostat (Reference

224

3000, Gamry, Warminster, PA). These current densities were anticipated to facilitate regeneration

225

via protons from OER (i.e., water oxidation) while minimizing large pH drops that promote metal

226

elution.13,31 Note that the low electrolyte concentration and high current condition (10 mM at 4.96

227

mA/cm2) was omitted from the experimental matrix due to a voltage overload (>13V) from the

228

high ohmic resistance in the system.

231

Adsorbent Characterization

232

We used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to examine the pre- and post-

233

electrochemical regeneration bonding environment of NH3-selective resins with a Nicolet iS50

234

ATR FT/IR Spectrometer (HeNe laser, Thermo Nicolet Company, USA). The wavenumber range

235

of FTIR spectra was 2000 cm-1 to 800 cm-1. To ensure homogeneity, all samples were ground with

236

a mortar and pestle before FTIR analysis.

237

Ionic Transport through Two-Chamber Electrolysis Cell

238

Although we aimed to avoid zinc elution from the resins, its elution and transport could

239

affect ammonia recovery by influencing the transference number (i.e., the fraction of the total

240

current carried by each ionic species). To investigate the consequences of potential zinc elution,

241

we explored the cationic transport of Zn2+ against other relevant cations in a two-chamber

242

electrolysis cell without resin (Figure 1b). The anode and cathode chambers were separated by

243

two types of cation exchange membrane (CEM). These membranes are categorized as either a

244

standard membrane (CEM, CMI-7000, Membranes International Inc., Ringwood, NJ) or

245

monovalent-selective membrane (CMS, same as used for electrochemical regeneration with resin)

246

for further reference. More information on membrane properties is listed in Table S2.32

247

We evaluated three solutions with varying concentrations of Zn2+, NH4+, and K+ to compare the

248

transference number of each compound. These solutions were chosen to elucidate the effect of the

TAN/Zn2+ ratio (2:1, 1:1, 0:1) on cation transference numbers (Table S3). Equation 5 shows the

267

ZnCl2 into the anolyte bottle at 35 mL/min to supply Zn(II) ions into the system. Electrolyte

268

solutions were recirculated with a separate pump at 40 mL/min. Recovery flow rates ensured 100

269

mL recirculation in electrolyte bottles and differed between the two pumps due to a difference in

270

tubing diameter (1/16” for EC-IX recirculation and 1/12” for ZnCl2 flow). The anolyte outflow

271

was placed in a waste bottle to prevent the recirculation of NH3 and promote Zn2+ ion exchange

272

with the carboxylate sites. We collected 1 mL samples from the anolyte (holding bottle and

273

outflow) and catholyte at several time points over the 2-hour experiment. Afterwards, the reloaded

274

resin was placed in hydrolyzed urine for another adsorption stage at the 100 mg resin/mL (as

275

opposed to 75 mg/mL for pure ammonium) solution ratio for 24 hours. Finally, the resin was

276

regenerated with 5 mL of 0.5 M H2SO4 and analyzed by IC to determine the final ammonia and

277

zinc adsorption densities and to evaluate in situ reformation.

281

Effective ammonium recovery with metal-ligand adsorbents relies on maximizing NH3

282

adsorption and preserving the zinc-carboxylate bond. Solution composition, particularly pH and

283

TAN concentration, profoundly impacts the stability of metal-ligand adsorbents. Based on

284

previous work, the optimal pH for ammonia adsorption onto NH3-selective adsorbents is 9-10 and

285

the optimal TAN concentration is 200-300 mequiv N/L.10 These optimal solution conditions make

286

hydrolyzed urine (pH 9.2, 300-500 mequiv N/L) a promising adsorption solution. However, three

287

challenges for ammonia recovery occur outside of optimal conditions: (1) outer-sphere

288

electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate functional group on WAC and competing cations

289

in solution, (2) inner-sphere (ligand binding with Zn2+) interactions in solutions with high TAN

290

concentrations, and (3) protonation of carboxylate moieties in acidic conditions10,14 (Figure S3).

291

We first studied the mass to solution ratio for synthetic and hydrolyzed urine and its impact on

292

cation adsorption, metal elution, and the solution pH 7. At higher resin mass to solution ratios (i.e.,

293

resin doses), TAN adsorption plateaued due to excess adsorption sites binding to all available NH3

294

in solution (Figure 2a).

295

At higher resin doses, the adsorption solution pH deviates from the optimal pH range (9-10)

296

for selective adsorption due to shifts in equilibrium between ligand bond and solution

297

environment10,14 (Figure 2b). Because NH3 interacts with the Zn2+ ligand and NH4+ does not, NH3

298

can uniquely be removed via ligand binding.20,21 Adsorption decreases the conjugate base (NH3)

299

concentration, which decreases the solution pH. The natural buffering capacity of human urine35

300

(predominantly by carbonate and ammonia species) likely mitigated sharp pH drops at lower resin

301

to solution ratios in real urine compared to synthetic urine. The change in solution environment

302

also altered the ideal ammonia adsorbed to zinc elution ratio (Figure 2c). We observed ideal ratios

303

of 50 and 100 mg resin/mL of solution for 230 mM TAN synthetic urine and 340 mM TAN real

urine, respectively. At lower resin mass to solution doses, selective TAN removal resulted in

305

minimal zinc elution, while at higher doses, improved TAN removal led to other cations

outcompeting Zn2+ and electrostatically interacting with the carboxylate functional group.

In-situ Electrochemical Regeneration

311

The electrochemical regeneration efficiency of NH3-selective adsorbents determines TAN

312

recovery. More specifically, electrochemical operating parameters can tune electrolyte pH and

313

facilitate protonation of removed ammonia into recovered ammonium. Both the molar

314

concentration of electrolyte solution and applied current influence the rate of water electrolysis

315

and thus the bulk solution pH.34,36–38 We compared two anolyte concentrations (K2SO4 at 10 mM

316

and 100 mM) and two current densities (0.08 mA/cm2 and 4.96 mA/cm2) using the monovalent-

317

selective membrane. Across the regeneration experiments with resin that treated real urine, NH4+

318

regeneration efficiency from electrochemical regeneration was between 60-90% (Figure 3). Using

319

100 mM electrolyte produced high total ammonia regeneration across both applied current

320

densities (83% vs 94% for 0.08 mA/cm2 and 4.96 mA/cm2, respectively) (Figure 3a). For constant

321

applied current density, the difference in electrolyte molar concentration varied the total ammonia

322

regeneration more (61% vs 83% for 10 mM and 100 mM, respectively) (Figure 3b). Overall,

323

increasing the molar concentration and current density resulted in a lower final solution pH, which

324

increased the protonation of ammonia to ammonium, thereby enhancing recovery into the cathode

325

and facilitating simultaneous regeneration of the zinc-carboxylate bond (Table S4).

326

We examined the distribution of NH4+ across both chambers and detected the lowest

327

recovery into the cathode chamber in 10 mM K2SO4 at 0.08 mA/cm2 (63% regeneration but only

328

21% recovery in cathode chamber) (Figure S4a). This recovery was likely due to the low

329

electrochemical potential difference across the membrane hindering cation transport.39,40 In

330

contrast, the concentrated 100 mM K2SO4 electrolyte exhibited higher total ammonia regeneration

331

across both applied current densities (83% total regeneration and 34% recovery in cathode for 0.08

332

mA/cm2 vs 94% total regeneration and 48% recovery in cathode for 4.96 mA/cm2) (Figure S5a

333

and Figure S6a). In every instance, the overall ammonium recovery to the cathode remained below

334

50%. However, like the total ammonia regeneration, recovery varied directly with molar

335

concentration and applied current density. Ammonia recovery was lower in our experiments

336

compared to previous nutrient recovery technologies because of the low applied current density

337

(approximately 0.08 and 4.96 mA/cm2 in this study; 30-180 mA/cm2 for electro-assisted

338

regeneration of urine-loaded commercial cation exchange resins13; 3-10 mA/cm2 for

339

electrochemical stripping25,41). Because we were interested in identifying the impact of operating

340

parameters more than maximizing performance in this study, lower ammonia recovery was not a

341

concern. Ultimately, too low of a current density would hinder ammonium electromigration and

342

favor H+ transport due to their higher ionic mobility.42 To emphasize the regeneration and recovery

343

of ammonium from NH3-selective adsorbents at these conditions, the applied current in the

344

electrochemical system should be higher than 0.08 mA/cm2. Based on the electrochemical

345

regeneration results, the electrolyte concentration was the most influential operating parameter that

346

dictates ammonium regeneration.

347

We complemented the NH4+ migration analysis by examining the competing cation in the

348

electrolytes, K+. Because we measured aqueous K+ concentrations in the anolyte and catholyte,

349

any K+ trapped in the membrane would not have been included in our measurements. During the

350

10 mM at 0.08 mA/cm2 scenario, we identified that summing anode and cathode chamber

351

concentrations left 17% of K+ unaccounted (Figure S4b). Increasing the background ion

352

concentration to 100 mM improved the transfer of K+ from anode to cathode and led to lower

353

unaccounted K+ fractions (6% for 0.08 mA/cm2, 4% for 4.96 mA/cm2) (Figure S5b and Figure

354

S6b). The low applied current likely led to K+ sorption in the membrane or the resin rather than

19

355

transport, which we did not distinguish. The same phenomena could occur for NH4+, meaning the

356

“remaining” fraction contains both membrane and resin sorption. Ion sorption in cation exchange

357

membranes is enhanced at low applied current density because of low cation flux across the

358

membrane.44 Compared to K+, unaccounted NH4+ generally exceeded the background electrolyte

359

in all electrochemical regeneration cases at each sample point (Figures S4-S6). While K+ and

360

NH4+ sorption were prevalent in 10 mM K2SO4 at 0.08 mA/cm2, operating at higher applied current

361

density mitigated ion sorption and facilitated ion transport due to a stronger electromigration

362

driving force.43 Ion sorption was the main sorption mechanism and the unaccounted K+ was

363

reversed after acid regeneration (0.5 M of H2SO4 at pH 0.45) closed the mass balance (Figure

364

S7a). As an alternative to acid regeneration, saturating cation exchange resins with nanopure water

365

after electrochemical regeneration could remove the lingering cations from fixed charged groups

366

in the membrane.45

367

Closing the mass balance of NH4+ required additional chemical regeneration with strong

368

acids (0.5 M of H2SO4 at pH 0.45) after electrochemical regeneration of ammonia-saturated resin

369

(Figure S7b). As highlighted earlier, we observed the highest regeneration efficiency in the 100

370

mM K2SO4 at 4.96 mA/cm2 and the lowest in the 10 mM K2SO4 at 0.08 mA/cm2 condition.

371

Nevertheless, most resin sites were regenerated across all experimental conditions and facilitated

372

ammonium regeneration from ammonia-saturated resin. At higher K2SO4 concentration and

373

applied current density, the final solution pH trended acidic (Table S4). Dynamic bias systems,

374

where regeneration occurs at 0.08 mA/cm2 and recovery occurs at 4.96 mA/cm2, could circumvent

375

the zinc elution and ion sorption challenges.

377

378

Zinc Elution

379

Across all experimental conditions, we detected zinc elution in the anode chamber after 1

380

hour of operation. For zinc elution from ammonia-saturated resins, the combination of low current

381

and low K+ concentration led to minimal zinc elution (<4%) by the end of the experiment (Figure

382

3b). Experiments with higher K+ electrolyte concentrations enhanced K+ competition with Zn2+

383

for carboxylate moieties. Furthermore, the concentrated anolyte salt (100 mM) led to a more drastic

384

pH drop (Table S4). In the 10 mM at 0.08 mA/cm2 case, the initial pH was 5.5 ± 0.5 and final pH

385

was 4.2 ± 0.6; in the 100 mM at 0.08 mA/cm2 case, the initial pH was 5.3 ± 0.2 and final pH was

386

3.3 ± 0.1. Similar to regeneration efficiency, the anolyte concentration influenced zinc elution

387

more than applied current density. The final solution pH also directly correlated with the stability

388

of zinc-carboxylate bonds with more acidic conditions leading to more zinc elution. The choice of

389

electrolyte could improve zinc-carboxylate stability during regeneration by limiting the OER

390

overpotential on iridium oxide anodes. For example, sodium ions exhibit a smaller overpotential

391

enhancement of OER compared to potassium ions.46 Furthermore, innovative resin chemistries

392

that strengthen the zinc-carboxylate bond could also improve ammonia adsorption in complex

393

wastewaters and advance electrochemical ammonium recovery technologies.5 Finally, combining

394

pH buffer resins (tertiary amine) with NH3-selective resins14 could also mitigate pH drops and

395

exhibit tandem improvements of ammonium regeneration efficiency and mitigation zinc elution

396

across electrochemical operating parameters.

397

398

Adsorbent Characterization

399

Ideal electrochemical regeneration protonates NH3 to NH4+ while preserving the zinc-

400

carboxylate bond. Identifying changes in the ligand structure between pre- and post-regeneration

401

adsorbents will help inform how experimental conditions (i.e., adsorption solution,

402

electrochemical operating parameters) influence ammonia binding and zinc elution. Urine-loaded

403

adsorbents exhibited similar absorbance peak intensity with post-regenerated adsorbents at 0.08

404

mA/cm2 compared to less pronounced peak intensity in the 4.96 mA/cm2 experiments (Figure 4).

405

Peaks across all experimental conditions match antisymmetric (1537 cm-1) and symmetric (1407

406

cm-1) stretches for carboxylate functional groups.47 Electrochemical regeneration at 0.08 mA/cm2

407

did not remove all NH3 from ligand binding and a mild N-H bend exists between 950 cm-1 to 1120

408

cm-1. Examining all regeneration conditions with the real urine-loaded resin, the subtle C=O stretch

409

at 1700 cm-1 is likely caused by the protonation of carboxylate sites to carboxylic acid.

410

Furthermore, the transition from the COO- asymmetric stretch to the C=O stretch is less

pronounced in the 100 mM at 4.96 mA/cm2 concentration experiment where zinc elution prevailed

412

during regeneration. The C=O stretch is prevalent across all electrochemical regeneration

413

experiments regardless of adsorption solution or electrochemical operating parameters (Figure 4,

414

Figure S8). Comparing spectra across ammonia adsorption solutions, pure ammonium TAN and

415

synthetic urine produced similar intensity peaks during electrochemical regeneration at 100 mM

416

at 4.96 mA/cm2 compared to adsorbents before regeneration (Figure S8). Based on these results,

417

additional adsorption and regeneration cycles could be performed after electrochemical

Ion Migration: Transference of Ammonium, Potassium, and Zinc

423

To examine how eluted zinc influences cation transport, we investigated the transference

424

number of relevant cations (K+, NH4+, and Zn2+) in several electrolytes (compositions in Table

425

S3) across standard and monovalent-selective cation exchange membranes. K+ and Zn2+ can

426

compete with NH4+ for transport across membranes and diminish NH4+ recovery in the catholyte.48

427

In both membranes, the transference number for all cations (K+, NH4+, and Zn2+) peaked within

428

the first 30 minutes and gradually decreased during the experiment (Figure 5). Compared to the

429

standard membrane, the monovalent-selective membrane exhibited less relative K+ transport and

430

more relative NH4+ transport. For the standard membrane, K+ and NH4+ contributed most of the

431

charge transport throughout the experiment (Figure 5a). Due to its larger ionic radius, Zn2+

432

contributed the least amount of charge, migrating slower through membrane matrix than

433

monovalent ions with smaller ionic radii (K+ and NH4+).49

434

For the monovalent-selective membrane, a similar transference number trend was

435

observed, where the membrane completely hindered the migration of Zn2+ ions into the cathode

436

chamber due to size exclusion, leaving only K+ and NH4+ transport (Figure 5b). These results

437

indicate that implementing a monovalent-selective membrane would not hinder the total charge

438

carried nor ammonium recovery during electrochemical regeneration of NH3-selective resins since

439

H+ would supplement lost charge. For both membranes, as the transference number of cations

440

decreased from migration there was a gradual increase in current carried from protons produced

441

by OER. To maintain a constant current, proton transport increased due to cation depletion within

442

the system, with proton production from OER supplementing charge during the later stage as

443

cations migrated from anode to cathode.13 During in-situ regeneration of NH3-selective resins, we

24

444

expect the concentrations of the summed concentration NH4+ and Zn2+ will be lower compared to

445

that of K+ (background electrolyte).

446

As we changed the concentration, we noticed a preservation in trends across membranes but

447

observed differences in transference from each non-H+ cation (Figure 5 vs Figure S9). The

448

reduced ionic conductivity of the monovalent-selective membrane compared to the standard

449

membrane decreased the NH4+ transference, thereby lowering the overall transference contribution

450

from non-H+ cations. In the standard membrane, the higher mobility and abundance of K+ cations

451

compensated for the lower charge carried by Zn2+ to ensure a constant current was maintained in

452

the system. Compared to the equimolar case, lower initial NH4+ concentration led to more charge

453

carried by K+ for both the standard and monovalent-selective membrane (92% and 42% at 0.5

454

hours, respectively) (Figure S9). However, similarly to the equimolar condition, proton generation

455

from OER supplemented most of the charge at longer electrolysis times. When we reduced the

456

ionic strength of the electrolyte by removing NH4+ but maintained equal concentrations of K+ and

457

Zn2+, K+ was the dominant charge carrier. (Figure S10). However, when NH4+ was present in

458

solution then H+ was the predominant charge carrier in both membranes (Figure 5 and Figure S9).

459

Across all ion migration experiments, slower Zn2+ diffusion across the standard and monovalent-

460

selective membrane forced the competing monovalent cations (i.e., K+ and NH4+) to carry the

461

charge until OER produced sufficient protons for migration.

464

Transference Ratio

465

To further evaluate cation migration across each membrane, we calculated the ratio of

466

transference numbers (transference ratio) of NH4+ ions compared to the background electrolyte

467

cation, K+. For the monovalent-selective membrane at equimolar concentration (100 mM

468

K+/NH4+/Zn2+), the transference ratio between K+ and NH4+ hovered near 1, indicating an equal

469

migration of both cations from anode to cathode chamber (Figure 6a). Compared to the standard

470

membrane, the transference ratio was enhanced in the monovalent membrane (1.05 ± 0.01 at 6

471

hours for the monovalent and 0.73 ± 0.14 standard membrane). The standard membrane’s lower

472

NH4+ migration to the catholyte was likely due to Zn2+ binding in the standard cation exchange

473

membrane, which could block exchange sites and limit the migration for cations with smaller

474

hydration shells (i.e., K+ and NH4+).49,50

475

Based on the transference ratio in the monovalent-selective membrane, the rejection of

476

Zn2+ did not hinder cation migration of K+ or NH4+ nor charge carried within the system. Due to

477

similar ionic size and charge5,8, the transference ratio of K+ and NH4+ was governed by the initial

478

ionic ratio between the cations. When we lowered the initial concentration of NH4+, the resulting

479

NH4+/K+ transference ratio (~0.5 NH4+/K+) in both membranes followed the initial ionic ratio in

480

the electrolyte (Figure 6). Overall, these experiments without resin show that using a monovalent-

481

selective membrane could prevent metal precipitation in electrochemical recovery systems,

482

enhance ammonium recovery (ion migration of NH4+), and avoid adverse effects on OER.

In-situ Zinc Recovery and Cyclic Ammonia Adsorption

493

Electrochemical regeneration of ammonia-saturated resins facilitated ammonia protonation

494

and zinc elution to varying degrees across experimental conditions. We applied our insights from

495

ex-situ zinc-carboxylate column loading and ligand exchange chemistry to evaluate in-situ

496

reformation of the zinc-carboxylate bond after regeneration. In-situ reformation achieved similar

497

adsorption densities for NH3 (7.27 ± 0.47 mmol NH3/g resin and 6.29 ± 0.72 mmol NH3/g resin

498

for urine adsorption cycles 1 and 2, respectively) and Zn2+ (3.8 ± 0.63 mmol Zn2+/g resin and 3.2

499

± 1.3 mmol Zn2+/g resin for hydrolyzed urine adsorption cycles 1 and 2, respectively) (Figure 7).

500

A two-sample t-test revealed that the two means for NH3 and Zn2+ are not statistically different (p-

501

value of 0.12 for NH3 and 0.17 for Zn2+). The pH of the 50 mM ZnCl2 solution (~6.2) helped

502

maintain the WAC functional group speciation towards carboxylate instead of carboxylic acid.

503

Simultaneously, ion exchange was aided by NH3 removal likely from increased zinc-ammine

504

complexes in solution.10,51,52 We further explored zinc-carboxylate bond reformation with Na+

505

loaded resins and >95% of sites were zinc-loaded after 180 minutes (Figure S11a). Our results

506

indicate in-situ reloading procedures could facilitate long-term selective resin use for ammonium

507

recovery. A semicontinuous electrochemical treatment system that combines continuous flow for

508

zinc loading and batch for ammonia adsorption could promote full-scale ammonium recovery

509

technologies.53 Based on these results, in-situ reformation of the zinc-carboxylate bond can be

510

achieved without applied current and with minimal chemical inputs. We encourage future research

511

efforts to continue exploring metal-ligand coordination chemistry and adsorbent stability to

512

promote ammonium recovery from waste streams.

Conclusion

516

This study explored the ammonia adsorption efficiency (ammonia removal) and the in-situ

517

electrochemical regeneration (ammonium recovery) of NH3-selective adsorbents to advance ion

518

exchange technologies in water treatment and circular nitrogen management. Zinc elution from

519

the carboxylate moiety limits the effectiveness of NH3-selective adsorbents for ammonia removal

520

by sacrificing the adsorption sites. By exploiting a zinc elution pathway (inner-sphere ligand

521

bonding), we reformed the bond in-situ which can enable continuous TAN recovery after multiple

522

adsorption and regeneration cycles. We explored the resin characterization and process

523

performance across aqueous ammonia solution of varying complexity (pure ammonium, synthetic

524

urine, and real urine with organics) and electrochemical regeneration with varying current density

525

and electrolyte concentrations. Electrolyte concentration impacted ammonium regeneration

526

efficiency more than current density, and the most extreme conditions exhibited >97% ammonium

527

regeneration efficiency. However, a tradeoff exists between ammonia recovery and zinc elution

528

that could hinder implementation. Flow-through experiments showed that aqueous Zn2+ removed

529

ammonia from carboxylate moieties. The preservation of the carboxylate chemistry after

530

regeneration highlights the potential for multiple adsorption-regeneration cycles, as supported by

531

FTIR resin characterization that evinced minimal changes in bonding environment of

532

electrochemically regenerated resin compared to unamended NH3-selective adsorbents.

533

Electrochemically mediated regeneration of TAN-selective adsorbents furthers the

534

integration of adsorbents and electrochemistry to advance selective nitrogen separations. Using

535

ligand exchange for improved ammonia removal followed by electrochemical regeneration for

536

ammonia recovery overcomes the selectivity and regeneration challenges of existing adsorptive

537

nitrogen recovery techniques. We identified a tradeoff between ammonium regeneration and zinc

538

eluted within electrochemical systems. To preserve the zinc-carboxylate bond while facilitating

539

adequate ammonium recovery, electrochemical operators should use low molar concentrations (10

540

mM K2SO4) and applied current (0.08 mA/cm2) to minimize zinc elution (4%) and maximize NH4+

541

regeneration (61%). With 100 mM K2SO4 and 4.96 mA/cm2 we increased the ammonium

542

regeneration efficiency to >97% but observed 60% zinc elution. We demonstrate the improved

543

selectivity and recovery of TAN at low concentrations with NH3-selective adsorbents and implore

544

further exploration in complex wastewaters with varying TAN concentrations (e.g., 0.1-10 mg

545

TAN/L in fertilizer runoff55,56, 41-50 mg TAN/L in municipal wastewater influent57,58, and 30-

546

2500 mg TAN/L in industrial wastewaters).54 Future work will further interrogate multi-cycle

547

adsorbent durability using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (X-ray absorption near edge structure

548

and extended X-ray absorption fine structure) to identify the coordination environment and

549

elemental distribution of Zn2+ on ammonia-loaded and electrochemically regenerated resin.

550

Tracking the stability of the ammonia-zinc complex in adsorption, electrochemical regenerate, and

551

reformation solutions will enable electrochemical separations for nitrogen removal and recovery.

552

By tuning the electrochemical operating parameters and establishing process performance metrics

553

for effective TAN recovery and ligand stability, this study advances selective ammonium recovery

554

technologies, promotes a circular nitrogen economy, and repurposes waste into a value-added

555

product.
