dangerous threat in current times. In the aftermath of a CWA incident, it is vital to conduct

16

a thorough decontamination of the surrounding environment, encompassing all exposed

17

items. At the present time, decontamination systems continue to rely heavily on bleach-based

18

solutions due to the broad range of decontamination action. The limitations of these systems

19

include the potential for material destruction, high toxicity, generation of hazardous by-

20

products, and the necessity for waste treatment prior to safe disposal. Herein, we report a

21

decontamination strategy based on the use of a biodegradable ionic liquid (IL), cholinium

22

acetate (ChlAce). ChlAce can be employed in either an immobilized form or as a standalone

23

agent and is capable of sequestration via sorption (adsorption/absorption), confinement,

24

solubilization, and/or decontamination (neutralization) of CWA simulants, dimethyl

25

methylphosphonate (DMMP) and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), in their gaseous and

26

liquid states at relatively mild temperatures. The combination of ChlAce with choline

27

hydroxide facilitates a more rapid neutralization reaction resulting in less toxic

28

neutralization by-products. This approach offers a straightforward solution that

29

circumvents the high toxicity, corrosion, and method complexity associated with current in

30

situ decontamination methods.

31
32

The Chemical Weapons Convention, the world’s first multilateral disarmament agreement,1 was

33

signed in 1997 and has since banned the production, storage, and use of chemical weapons.

34

Unfortunately, the continued threat of active conflict and the high probability of chemical attacks,

35

as evidenced by the Syrian civil war2 and terrorism incidents3, demonstrate that humanity still lives

36

in perilous times.4,5

37

There are a wide variety of known chemical warfare agents (CWAs), and the process for their

38

destruction and/or decontamination will depend on the type of agent, concentration, type of

39

release, and location site.6,7 In the event of a CWA incident, after the threat is contained,

40

considerable care needs to be taken for in situ decontamination. In an enclosed space, gaseous

41

CWAs can be removed through active ventilation, or air filtration systems can also be employed,

42

which combine filters that contain efficient adsorbents, such as modified impregnated activated

43

carbon.8,9 Over the past decade, the quest for new and effective decontamination materials that can

44

capture CWA in the gas phase has predominantly focused on porous catalysts, especially metal

45

organic frameworks (MOFs)10–15, single or mixed oxides/hydroxides16–22, and zeolites23,24.

46

However, the manufacturing of these materials at a large scale has proven challenging, and their

47

high cost has limited their widespread use. In the event of a CWA diffuse within a confined space,

48

it is imperative that all objects and surfaces undergo decontamination through the application of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

49

physical and/or chemical agents. The most common decontamination formulations are water- or

50

foam-based, non-aqueous, or emulsions. Strong alkaline solutions and oxidants, such as peroxides

51

and chlorinated solutions (e.g., bleach), are typically selected for a broad range of actions against

52

CWAs.25–27 However, these methods present several disadvantages due to the high corrosive

53

nature, toxicity, and large amount of toxic reactants in the majority of the solutions employed.

54

Additionally, the reduced storage time of chlorinated solutions and the necessity of wastewater

55

treatment after decontamination must be considered.7,28–31 The technology used for

56

decontamination is crucial, and in recent years, continuous flow reactors have attracted

57

considerable attention due to their rapid and selective neutralization of noxious substances. For

58

instance, an upstream continuous flow setup configuration has been developed for the selective

59

oxidation of organosulfur CWA simulants, which is capable of minimizing overoxidation to the

60

highly toxic sulfones (less than 1 %).32

61

Ionic liquids (ILs) have also been studied for CWA decontamination and neutralization. ILs are

62

basically organic salts molten below 100 °C that present remarkable properties of low vapor

63

pressure, chemical and thermal stability, tunability, nonflammability, biodegradability, and many

64

other advantages. Their powerful solvation ability has been explored for CWA extraction from

65

different surfaces. For example, a reactive gel based on an imidazolium IL has been used as a

66

barrier to contain mustard agent simulant vapors in different surfaces, such as glass, wood, rubber,

67

and painted steel.33 Other ILs based on imidazolium cations have been reported for their rapid

68

decontamination reactions when mixed with other reagents, resulting in alcoholysis, hydrolysis,

69

and dehydrohalogenation processes.34–37 These outcomes showcase the high potential of ILs to

70

solubilize CWA simulants, although they still require the addition of corrosive agents, which is a

71

drawback, and imidazolium-based ILs can also be quite toxic. Another example of improved

72

solubilization was the incorporation of an IL, N-butyl-3-methylpyridinium dicyanamide, into a Zr-

73

MOF catalyst. The presence of the IL not only enhanced the equilibrium adsorption capacities of

74

the catalyst but also aided the in situ decontamination process of dimethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate

75

(DMNP) and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES).38 ILs could also be used for chemosensing. One

76

development is the room temperature fluorescence detection of sulfur mustard by a combination

77

of luminol and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide IL in water. In this particular case, the

78

IL facilitated the reaction temperature decrease by enhancing the nucleophilicity of luminol and

79

the electrophilicity of the sulfur mustard agent.39 ILs-based molecular platforms are even being

80

explored for the synthesis of acetylcholinesterase reactivators. This development has the potential

81

to create antidotes for nerve agent poisoning.40 A method for the destruction of toxic chemicals

82

based on ILs or eutectic solvents was also developed and patented.41 However, the technique relies

83

on mixing the agents in the liquid phase. While ILs sorption capacity to toxic gases has been

84

explored, to our knowledge CWA sorption has remained relatively unexplored.42–47

85

While assessing all of the work reported to date, it is difficult to compare decontamination systems

86

due to the differences in objectives, application methods, operating conditions, reaction rates, and

87

by-products, among other factors.48 While several promising studies have highlighted the potential

88

of ILs as effective liquid-liquid extractors for CWAs, challenges still remain within these

89

decontamination systems, ranging from a narrow CWA range to complicated synthetic processes,

90

unrealistic in situ applications, hazardous by-products that require waste treatment prior to

91

disposal, and high-cost systems, among other disadvantages. Indisputable, ILs have the potential

92

for defense, decontamination, and sensing of CWAs and their simulants. It should be noted that

93

for research purposes, simulants are usually used instead of the real CWAs, since they have similar

94

chemical composition and physical properties but have lower toxicity. Here, we report the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

95

development of a sustainable CWA sequestration and decontamination (neutralization) system that

96

can eliminate most of the aforementioned drawbacks. This practical and simple system is based

97

on the environmentally friendly and low toxicity IL, cholinium acetate (ChlAce).49–51 This

98

ChlAce-based decontamination system is capable of sorption, confinement, solubilization, and/or

99

neutralization of the CWA simulants, dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) and CEES, in their

100

liquid and gas phases (Fig. 1). This is most useful for gentle on-site decontamination where relative

101

care is necessary to avoid the destruction of contaminated materials and surfaces. The low vapor

102

pressure of the ILs is a great advantage, as it can contain the agents and limit their tendency to

103

evaporate, unlike some water- or alcohol-based decontamination formulations. The sorption or

104

solvation of the simulants by ChlAce can then be neutralized by a mild thermal treatment. In this

105

decontamination reaction, it is the acetate anion that inactivates the CWA simulants, unlike known

106

decontamination systems. At room temperature, decontamination can be performed by combining

107

ChlAce with choline hydroxide in a 7:3 stoichiometry, resulting in faster decontamination. In this

108

scenario, some material corrosion may occur, although significantly less than that observed with a

109

commercial bleach decontaminant. When using the ChlAce-based decontamination system, the

110

neutralization reaction by-products are less harmful than the simulants. This work presents the

111

scope of this novel CWA simulants decontamination and neutralization system based on the IL,

112

ChlAce.

Results and Discussion

125

The IL decontamination system for DMMP and CEES was demonstrated by systematic studies of

126

sorption and neutralization. DMMP is a surrogate of the nerve agent sarin, while mustard gas

127

simulant CEES is a blistering agent (Fig. 1a).25 Since the CWA simulants still have high associated

128

toxicity, all experiments involving them were performed in a controlled laboratory at the

129

Portuguese Army facilities.

130
131

Sorption Analysis

132

A wide variety of ILs (cholinium, imidazolium, pyridinium, and aliquat®-based) were studied for

133

their simulant sorption capacity. This first step was crucial for the selection of the IL

134

decontamination system. Deep eutectic solvents (DES) were also analyzed, most of which were

135

based on choline chloride as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Sorption capacity was studied with the

136

simulants in a gas phase and in contact with the IL, determined by headspace sampling and

137

quantified by GC/MS (see Supplementary Information for methods and conditions, section 2).

138

ILs sorption results for DMMP and CEES are depicted in Fig. 2. This screening shows that there

139

is generally a greater sorption capacity for DMMP than for CEES. Nevertheless, these results

140

indicate the potential for an efficient dual simulant sorption system. Cholinium cation (Chl) based

141

ILs have a higher sorption affinity for both simulants compared to other IL cations or to DES

142

(Supplementary Fig. 3). Due to the hydrophobic nature of CEES (partially soluble in water)52 a

143

higher affinity for hydrophobic ILs (NTf2 anion based) or DES (choline chloride/urea,

144

thymol/octanoic acid (Thy/Oct), menthol/octanoic acid) was to be expected. However, the best

145

CEES sorption results are observed for cholinium-based ILs, namely ChlIsob and ChlOct (sorption

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

146

> 90 %). In the scope of ILs/DES, the DMMP sorption capacity has an average of circa 80 %, with

147

the best results being obtained with ChlOct and ChlProl (sorption > 90 %) (Supplementary Fig. 3).

160

In this sorption scope, ChlAce demonstrates good sorption features for both DMMP and CEES.

161

While its sorption may be slightly less efficient as other ILs, it does offer the most cost-effective

162

solution. Furthermore, the cholinium core, which contains a quaternary ammonium cation with a

163

polar hydroxyl group, has been previously reported to have lower toxicity when compared to the

164

imidazolium cation.53 Additionally, ChlAce is water soluble and in vitro skin assays classified it

165

as non-irritant (in accordance with the UN GSH and EU CLP “No Category” (UN, 2009;

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

166

No.1272/2008, EU, 2008). See Supplementary Information for methods and conditions).

167

Hereafter, due to the substantial benefits it offers, all studies were centered around ChlAce.

168

In sorption studies, the role of water is also an important factor to consider. In real-life atmospheric

169

conditions, relative humidity is variable and can potentially modify the sorption process. For this

170

reason, the sorption capacity of ChlAce was analyzed under different water content conditions,

171

ranging from basic ambient storage level (water content of 8.4 %) up to a 30 % water increase

172

(Supplementary Fig. 4). The results show that the sorption of DMMP by ChlAce is not

173

significantly influenced by the increase of water content, in contrast to CEES, where a decrease of

174

about 20 % was observed. This decrease is probably due to CEES partial solubility in water, which

175

slows down the sorption rate.

176
177

ChlAce simulant neutralization with temperature

178

The efficacy of ChlAce as a decontamination system was demonstrated by its sorption capacity.

179

Furthermore, its ability to neutralize simulants single-handedly was also confirmed by the

180

application of a mild temperature treatment. This outcome was observed upon simulant sorption

181

and neutralization studies performed at 70 °C for 18 h in ChlAce (see Supplementary Information

182

for methods and conditions). The simulants were present in the gas phase throughout the course

183

of the assay. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the decrease in DMMP quantity does not correspond to the

184

amount of DMMP sorbed by ChlAce, except at approximately the half-hour mark. After this time,

185

the quantity of unaccounted DMMP continues to increase, and given that these assays are

186

conducted in a closed system, this indicates that DMMP is not only being sorbed but also

187

neutralized. In the particular case of CEES, this neutralization is so complete that after a period of

188

1 h, nearly half of the simulant has already been sorbed and neutralized (Fig. 3b). Additionally,

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

189

CEES sorption assays were performed at room temperature for an extended period of time (72 h,

190

Supplementary Fig. 6). At the conclusion of the 72 h period at room temperature, CEES was not

191

fully volatilized. Nevertheless, at this point in time, ChlAce demonstrated the capacity to confine

192

22 % and to have simultaneously sorbed and neutralized approximately 65 %.

213

Based on the aforementioned sorption/neutralization outcomes, direct liquid-liquid contact assays

214

were conducted (see Supplementary Information for methods and conditions). During the course

215

of these assays, neat ChlAce and the simulants, were kept in contact for a period of 18 h at a range

216

of temperatures. Fig. 3c shows that DMMP starts to neutralize at temperatures circa 50 °C. At

217

70 °C and 18 h of contact, the DMMP maximum neutralization efficiency reaches its peak at

218

around 80 %. For CEES (Fig. 3d), the neutralization temperature is significantly lower, with some

219

decontamination already observed at 5 °C. CEES neutralization is almost complete at 60 °C after

220

18 h. By reducing the assay time to 2 h and increasing the temperature to 100 °C, the neutralization

221

efficiency for both simulants is comparable to that achieved after 18 h at 50 °C for each respective

222

simulant.

223

The neutralization products resulting from the application of ChlAce as a decontamination system

224

for DMMP and CEES were analyzed by NMR. The decontamination of DMMP revealed the

225

presence of neutralization products, methoxy(methyl)phosphinate, methanol, and methyl acetate

226

(Supplementary Fig. 9). These products derive from the nucleophilic attack of the carboxylate

227

anion on the methyl ester group of DMMP. As for CEES decontamination products, the analysis

228

revealed the formation of 2-(ethylsulfanyl)ethyl acetate (Supplementary Fig. 10), which is derived

229

from the acetate nucleophilic substitution on the C-Cl bond.

230
231

ChlAce simulant neutralization at room temperature

232

Implementing ChlAce as a neutralization system at room temperature requires the incorporation

233

of a nucleophile to enhance the efficiency and speed of the decontamination process. The room

234

temperature neutralization assays were performed by placing the simulant in a liquid phase in

235

direct contact with the IL for a period of up to 5 h. The Supplementary Information comprises

236

preliminary studies of the incorporation of ChlAce into several neutralizing systems, including

237

commercial decontamination systems. These studies also examine the effects of different

238

nucleophiles (hydroxide, polyamine, and imidazole) and oxidant (oxone®) on the decontamination

239

of DMMP. After thorough research, the most efficacious system was identified as the

240

incorporation of ChlAce with choline hydroxide (ChlAce/ChlOH) in a 7:3 stoichiometry

241

(Supplementary Fig. 11). The hydroxide anion presence in this decontamination system promotes

242

the hydrolysis of the simulants. Despite the analysis of different stoichiometries, the neutralization

243

outcomes remained similar. Therefore, it is preferable to use the lowest possible amount of

244

hydroxide to minimize toxicity and corrosion risks.

245

Afterwards, the selected room temperature neutralization system, comprising ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3)

246

with different water content, was assessed over a 5 h period for the neutralization of DMMP and

247

CEES (Supplementary Fig. 12). In the particular case of CEES, the neutralization process is

248

instantaneous. The neutralization efficiency of DMMP increased with an rise in contact time for

249

all water incremented systems. Nevertheless, the ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) system exhibits the greatest

250

neutralization capacity under water saturated conditions, with an average efficiency increase of

251

8 % for each additional contact time. Ultimately, the system achieved a DMMP neutralization of

252

80 % at 5 h. The neutralization efficiency still remains between 70 and 80 % for 5 h, even when

253

the water content is increased from saturated conditions up to a 20 % water increment. These

254

findings substantiate the efficacy of ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) in neutralizing CEES and DMMP, the

255

latter even in the presence of a 20 % water increment.

256

The ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) neutralization mixture was also tested for its sorption capacity, with the

257

simulant being in the gas phase. This study was performed with variable water content. Under

258

saturated conditions, the mixture exhibits sorption/neutralization of 96 % and 85 % for DMMP

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

259

and CEES, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13). When compared to the same ChlAce assay

260

(Supplementary Fig. 4), there is a 17 % increase in decontamination efficiency for both simulants.

261

This efficiency increase was expected due to the neutralization mixture’s ability to not only sorb

262

but also neutralize the simulants through the presence of the hydroxide anion and thereby enhance

263

the sorption capacity. In the DMMP decontamination, it was observed that the increase in water

264

content does not significantly decline the neutralization process. This is not the case for CEES

265

decontamination, as it experiences a significant decrease in efficiency of around 25 % with just a

266

10 % increase in water content. As CEES hydrolysis is dependent on its dissolution, an increase

267

in the water ratio will hinder its solubility in the decontamination system, resulting in a loss of

268

efficiency.

269

The reaction between ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) and DMMP was analyzed through a kinetics study by

270

NMR (Supplementary Fig. 14). After a minimum of 5 min of contact, the neutralization products

271

observed were methoxy(methyl)phosphinate (MMP) and methanol. These products are derived

272

from the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide anion on DMMP. After 4.5 h, the simulant was

273

nearly neutralized (Supplementary Fig. 14). Generally, DMMP degradation products vary

274

depending on the reaction process and can result in a number of compounds, including phosphates,

275

acids, and gases. While MMP is not commonly reported, it has been identified by mass

276

spectrometry in studies examining site selectivity with several anions in gas phase reactions with

277

DMMP.54,55

278

In the presence of the neutralization mixture ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3), CEES hydrolyzes to the well-

279

known ethyl 2-hydroxyethyl sulfide (HEES) (Supplementary Fig. 15). For comparison purposes,

280

the hydrolysis of CEES was also tested in the presence of an alkaline sodium hydroxide solution.

281

After 13 days, a residual amount of CEES was still observed. Additionally, an excess of NaOH

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

282

was also added into this reaction, and no notable difference was observed. As for CEES in the

283

presence of ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3), it significantly accelerates the neutralization, requiring only 24 h

284

to achieve the same results that took 13 days with the alkaline solution. It is therefore evident that

285

ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) is a highly effective room temperature neutralization system. ChlAce/ChlOH

286

(7:3) DMMP neutralization efficiency was further evaluated after a 6 months period under basic

287

storage ambient conditions. The results indicate a gradual decline in efficiency, with circa 2 % loss

288

per month probably due to some reduction of hydroxide content derived from Chl degradation via

289

Hofmann elimination (Supplementary Fig. 16).

290

One drawback of current neutralization systems is the corrosion of materials. Therefore, a

291

corrosion assay was devised to analyze the possible material damage when using ChlAce/ChlOH

292

(7:3) system. Nine different metals (aluminum, brass, bronze, copper, mild steel, pure lead,

293

stainless steel AISI 304, tin, and zinc) were coated with ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) and compared with

294

those coated with sodium hypochlorite containing 6.5-6.8 % of active chlorine. After a 22 day

295

period at 26 ºC and 60 % humidity, the plates were analyzed using an optical microscope and

296

scanning electron microscope (see Supplementary Information for methods and conditions). The

297

majority of metal plates coated with ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) (Supplementary Tables 5-13) exhibited

298

less corrosion compared to those coated with sodium hypochlorite, with the exception of copper,

299

pure lead, and zinc. While copper and pure lead display similar corrosion behavior with respect to

300

both coatings, the corrosion of zinc metal plates was more pronounced with the ChlAce/ChlOH

301

(7:3) layer. No corrosion was noticeable in the stainless steel plates. Upon extending the assay

302

time and increasing the temperature (50 ºC for 2 months), the stainless steel plate coated with

303

ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) remained with no observable corrosion, while the coating with bleach

304

solution caused staining (Supplementary Table 14).

305

ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) as a neutralization mixture has proven to be highly effective, although it may

306

require more time than the typical bleach solutions to achieve maximum decontamination.

307

However, bleach solutions are known to be corrosive, toxic, and can produce highly toxic

308

neutralization byproducts. A comparison between ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) and sodium hypochlorite

309

with 6.5-6.78 % of active chlorine revealed that the former has a reduced corrosive effect. This,

310

coupled with the relatively lower toxicity of ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) by-products, highlights a

311

significant advantage of our system, thus showcasing the superior performance and relative safety

312

of using ChlAce/ChlOH (7:3) as the decontamination method for DMMP and CEES.

313
314

Immobilization studies

315

Several materials have already been reported as suitable solid matrices for immobilization and

316

destruction of CWAs, with a particular emphasis on activated charcoal as an efficient absorbent.9

317

Our study also focuses on the immobilization of ChlAce within various solid matrices, which could

318

potentially be employed in air filtration systems for contaminated environments or as a protective

319

barrier. The aim of this particular study is not only to develop a safe and effective method for

320

capture and confinement of CWAs but also to provide a safer environment for the disposal of

321

simulants. By trapping the simulants within the solid matrix that comprises ChlAce, it is possible

322

to neutralize the simulant at moderate temperatures (as demonstrated in the aforementioned

323

studies, see Supplementary Information for methods and conditions). Granulated activated

324

charcoal combined with ChlAce exhibits the highest sorption capacity for both simulants

325

(Supplementary Fig. 17). In this instance, the addition of up to 20 % of ChlAce to the solid matrix

326

resulted in an approximate 80 % increase of DMMP and CEES sorption capacity. A surprising yet

327

effective immobilization matrix was ChlAce in gelatine (circa 100 % for DMMP). In the right

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kl000 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-5948 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

328

conditions, gelatine can be used to create a biodegradable film that provides a gas protective

329

barrier. This flexible film can protect various surfaces, ranging from simple door handles to

330

electronic equipment. The sorption of DMMP in this matrix is independent of the amount of

331

ChlAce present, however its presence provides a solid consistency to the gelatine.

332
333

ChlAce barrier on fabric surface

334

Regarding a possible application of ChlAce as a barrier to protect against toxic agents from skin

335

contact, a direct IL spray solution application onto the surface of military uniform (MU) samples

336

was developed. After the fabric drying process, the retention capacity for DMMP and CEES was

337

quantified (see Supplementary Information for methods and conditions).

338

As can be observed in Fig. 4, CEES retention efficiency in all samples is lower than that for

339

DMMP. The ILs that were dissolved in 20 % of water exhibited higher retention efficiency for

340

both simulants than the ones dissolved in 10 % of ethanol, probably due to a more effective spray

341

dispersion. When compared with the blank samples (MU), it is evident that the fabric samples

342

treated with the ILs have a significant simulant retention improvement, particularly for ChlAce

343

(sprayed for 1 min in a horizontal direction) and ChlProp samples (sprayed for 0.5 min in a

344

horizontal and vertical direction), both with 20 % water. In the case of DMMP retention efficiency,

345

the IL spray application is shown to be comparable to the TOM protective suit. However, when

346

regarding CEES, the fabric treated with the IL displays a greater retention improvement when

compared with the fabric of the Paul Boyé Technologies protective suit TOM, which is a CBRN

348

(chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense) suit compliant with NATO AEP-38.

352

with a direct IL spray solution, with the IL being dissolved in water (20 %) or ethanol (10 %) and

353

dispersed in different directions (H – horizontal, V – vertical) and time conditions (0.5 min and 1

354

min). Blank samples of the tested military uniform (MU) and the TOM Protective Suit (TOM,

355

CBRN suit NATO AEP-38 compliant) were also analyzed. The fabric samples containing the

356

dispersed IL solution were dried before being subjected to simulant quantification by GC/MS.

357

Displayed error bars indicate the standard deviation (n=5). See Supplementary Information for

358

further experimental details.

359
360

In a CWA incident, rapid response is necessary, and providing any protection in a prompt manner

361

is crucial. In this case, a portable spray system which can pulverize these ILs solutions on short

362

notice into a simple military uniform could probably save lives, specially since protective suits

363

such as TOM are not so readily available for a large number of personnel. In this line of thought,

364

and with the results presented, diverse prototypes could be developed. For example, with just

365

ChlAce immobilized in activated charcoal (20-35 mesh ASTM), it is possible to create air

366

purification systems and even face mounted filters to be adapted to personal protective equipment

367

filter masks as air-purifying respirators. The main advantage of this key filter layer is that the CWA

368

can be destroyed in situ and disposed of without prior specific treatment.

369

In summary, we report here a decontamination strategy that employs a biodegradable IL based on

370

ChlAce. This system, which can be immobilized, used as a standalone agent, or combined with a

371

nucleophile, has the capacity to remove and/or neutralize CWA simulants, DMMP and CEES. The

372

IL system is capable of sorption, confinement, solubilization, and/or neutralization of the CWA

373

simulants at mild temperatures. The results showed the efficacy of ChlAce in capturing and

374

decontamination (neutralization) CWA simulants in both their gaseous and liquid phases.

375

Furthermore, when combined with ChlOH at room temperature, it accelerates the decontamination

376

(neutralization) process, yielding less toxic by-products. The development outlined in this reported

377

study presents a simple, less toxic, and non-corrosive alternative to conventional decontamination

378

methodologies.
