Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are not rare, but rather abundant in the earth’s crust and excellent
catalysts for a multitude of organic reactions. They have been recently shown to be used in
the active sites of bacterial enzymes and thus essential for metabolic processes. However,
these elements have so far been entirely overlooked in their possible contributions to the
emergence of complex molecules. Here, we investigate the potential of REEs to act as
catalysts in a prebiotic reaction network resembling the biological Krebs cycle starting from
glyoxylate and pyruvate. Special focus is put on a comparison between trivalent REEs and
ferrous iron. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Contrary to Fe2+, the
formation of the reduced starting materials seems to be a major pathway when REEs are
involved. Their high coordination numbers, flexible coordination spheres and their hard Lewis
acidic properties make REEs excellent catalysts in abiotic chemical reaction networks
resembling conserved biochemical pathways.
Introduction
A main goal of Origin of Life (OoL) research is to narrow the gaps between prebiotic chemical
reactions on the early Earth and modern biochemistry. To this end it is necessary to get a
complete picture of prebiotically plausible reactions covering all possible environments and
conditions. However, one class of elements has so far been underrepresented with regards to
OoL research – the rare-earth elements (REEs) consisting of the lanthanides (Lns), scandium
and yttrium. These elements are, contrary to what their name might suggest, omnipresent in
earth’s continental crust today with abundances comparable to other common metals, such as

copper and zinc (La: 39 ppm, Ce: 66.5 ppm, Cu: 60 ppm, Zn: 70 ppm).[1] In a prebiotic context,
REEs are often used to investigate the nature and formation processes of the oldest terrestrial
rocks[2,3] and are in part represented in minerals most likely to be found on Hadean Earth.[4,5]
Additionally, they are incorporated in carbonaceous chondrite meteors in combination with a
complex mixture of organic substances.[6,7] From a reactivity stand point their weak ligand field
stabilization[8] and subsequent high water exchange rate coupled with a low hydrolysis constant
makes them efficient Lewis acid catalysts in water.[9,10] This fact alone makes it even more
surprising that REEs have so far been neglected in OoL research. In contrast, the transition
metal iron plays an integral part in the research into the abiotic generation of biological building
blocks,[11] given its important role in many different biological processes.[12] Members of the
REEs are the most recent addition to the group of biologically relevant metals.[13]
Methylotrophic bacteria can use lanthanides instead of calcium in the active sites of methanol
dehydrogenase enzymes (MDH), an essential component in their C1 metabolism.[14–18] The
gene xoxF encodes for this Ln-dependent MDH and as Keltjens et al. conclude, XoxF
represents an evolutionary older prototype of the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF-type).[19]
This fact, in combination with the likely existence of many more Ln-dependent enzymes, hints
towards an essential role of rare-earth metals in life from its very beginning on.
In this study we investigate the potential of REEs as catalysts in a prebiotic reaction network
resembling the biological Krebs cycle starting from glyoxylate and pyruvate. A special focus is
put on a comparison between trivalent REEs and ferrous iron.
Results and Discussion

Based on the seminal work of Moran and coworkers,[20] we initially focused on a direct
comparison of different REE chloride salts and ferrous chloride to survey their ability to catalyze
reactions in a prebiotic reaction network resembling the metabolic Krebs cycle. To that end,
sodium glyoxylate and sodium pyruvate were reacted with the respective salts for 3 h in mildly

acidic (pH 5 to 6) water at 70 °C in a sealed vessel purged with argon (molar ratios: 2:1:2,
glyoxylate:pyruvate:metal salt) simulating the environment of a hydrothermal vent. After
subsequent basification and derivatization according to a literature-known procedure,[20] the
reaction products were investigated by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) and the results are shown in Figure 1. The REEs that were chosen represent metal
cations over the whole series, with different sizes and thus charge densities, possibly resulting
in altered Lewis acidity and coordination numbers.
Notably, very similar products were obtained using REE or Fe2+, but there is a readily
observable difference in the relative product distributions between the REE salts and FeCl2.
Whereas α-ketoglutarate is a major product of the reaction with Fe2+, the starting material
glyoxylate is still present in significant amounts in the reactions containing REE salts. Another
key difference between iron and the REEs is the observed formation of mesaconate in the
REE-containing reactions. The pathway to this compound starts with a condensation of two
molecules of pyruvate and subsequent dehydration and decarboxylation. With Fe2+,
mesaconate could not be detected. While the formation of isocitrate is only observed with Fe2+
and Lu3+, lactate, the product of a reduction of the starting material pyruvate, can only be
detected in the REE-containing reactions with La3+ showing the highest amount.

coloring in the analytical data (see Figure 1 and SI).

Next, we wanted to track the variation in the product spectrum over time. The two metal salts
FeSO4 and La2(SO4)3 were chosen, as preliminary experiments showed a higher reactivity for

La2(SO4)3. This might be explained by the presence of the weakly basic sulfate anion. The
stoichiometry was changed to 2:1:1 (glyoxylate:pyruvate:Fe2+/La3+). The reaction mixture was
analyzed before metal salt addition (0 h) and after 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h,
respectively. As the sample preparation in the aforementioned reactions under the influence of
metal chlorides involved a harsh basification step to precipitate all present metal cations, which
in itself could influence the product spectrum, we were looking for an alternative, milder
protocol. To separate dissolved metal ions Chelex® 100 resin was used instead. Additional to
the GC-MS analysis, 1H NMR spectra were recorded for each step and the pH was determined.

marked in colored boxes and the respective structures marked with the same color.

Gas chromatograms of the reaction containing Fe2+ show no significant changes after 24 h.
The NMR spectra paint a similar picture with only slight changes after 24 h (see Figures S4

and S5). Especially in the NMR spectra after 1 h and 3 h the presence of paramagnetic iron in
solution is yielding broad peaks making reliable integration impossible. This is an indication
that the removal of metal ions is insufficient with the chosen exchange resin. After 5 h and
beyond, the improved resolution of the spectra coincides with the observed formation of
significant amounts of precipitate in the reaction vessel (see Figure S12). Overall, the formation
of α-ketoglutarate and tricarballylate as main products is verifiable by NMR and GC-MS. In the
low-field region of the spectra the formation of oxoglutaconate and formate can clearly be
observed, both of which could not be detected by GC-MS. The pH of the reaction mixture starts
of after metal salt addition at 4.7 and settles at about 6.5 after 24 h (see Figure S12).
Similar to the reaction containing Fe2+, in the reaction involving La2(SO4)3 the product spectrum
and distribution stays relatively constant after 24 h (see Figure S9) according to GC-MS.
However, just as in the reactions involving the REE chlorides and contrary to Fe2+, the
formation of the reduced starting materials seems to be a major pathway which can also be
confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (see Figures 3 and S2). While the quantity of lactate is
comparatively stable over time, the quantity of glycolate is increasing continuously.
At the start of the reaction, La2(SO4)3 never fully dissolves and a small amount of colorless
precipitate is observable in the reaction vessel (see Figure S11). Already after 3 h a substantial
increase in the amount of precipitate can be detected. The precipitate is still present after the
treatment with the Chelex® resin. This prompted us to investigate the lanthanum concentration
in solution at this point. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
gave a value of 330 µg∙mL−1 which corresponds to 2.4% of the initially added amount of La3+.
An elemental analysis of the precipitate after 3 h revealed a very low sulfur content in
combination with a relatively low hydrogen content (C: 15.49, H: 2.56, S: 1.01). The precipitate
after 3 h with one equivalent of La3+ was also investigated by IR spectroscopy (see Figure
S16). As a classical Cannizzaro reaction of glyoxylate yields oxalate as a product and as metal
oxalates are usually poorly soluble, this might point to the possible nature of the precipitate.
The IR spectra indicate the presence of an absorption band of the precipitate at 1313 cm−1
which would correspond to the C=O stretch of oxalate.[21] Thus, the resulting precipitate is most
likely a mixture of La3+ with oxalate, molecules of higher carbon content, such as pyruvate, and
small amounts of sulfate.
The fact, that the reaction continues at very low values of dissolved La3+ might indicate catalytic
activity of La3+ species present in solution or in a heterogenous fashion and in turn prompted
us to investigate the influence of La3+ concentration at the start of the reaction. To this end, the
reaction was repeated with 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 and 0 equivalents of La3+ in the form of La2(SO4)3 and
the reaction mixtures were investigated via 1H NMR after 3 h. The NMR spectra (see Figures
S6 and S7) show an increase in reaction dynamics at higher La3+ concentration detectable by

a more pronounced decrease in concentration of the starting materials. However, the overall
product spectrum and concentrations in all reactions containing La3+ are highly similar. The
reaction containing the starting materials without La3+ doesn’t show the formation of
oxoglutaconate, ketoglutarate or lactate. These results are an indication of catalytic activity of
La3+ in this reaction network.
As the most notable difference between the REE-containing reactions and those with Fe²⁺ is
the formation of significant amounts of glycolate and lactate, the reduced forms of the two
starting materials, these reactions justify a more detailed discussion. While Fe2+ could in
principle act as a reducing agent,[22] this is not the case for the used REEs. The reduction,
however, could be explained by the intrinsic reactivity of aldehydes. A disproportionation of
aldehydes is known as the Cannizzaro reaction[23] and involves the hydride transfer of a
reactive diol anion to the carbonyl function of a second aldehyde yielding the respective alcohol
and carboxylate after a proton transfer.[24] When a different carbonyl-containing molecule is
present as hydride acceptor the reaction is generally called crossed Cannizzaro reaction.
These reactions usually occur under strongly basic conditions as the first step involves the
nucleophilic attack of a hydroxide anion to the aldehyde. In the case of aldehydes with another
carbonyl in the α-position, a different mechanism comes into play when metal ions are involved.
The coordination of the metal center by the 1,2-dicarbonyl-containing molecule allows for an
intramolecular 1,2-hydride shift.[25] This reaction has been reported with different metal ions
including the REEs scandium and ytterbium.[26] In the case of lactate formation in the context
of this work, a possible mechanism is shown in Figure 4. In a first step, the glyoxylate hydrate
loses a proton and forms the reactive diol anion. Subsequently, a hydride is transferred to the
carbonyl of an adjacent pyruvate molecule, with a proton transfer yielding the products oxalate
and lactate. The role of La3+ in this reaction may be the activation of the carbonyl function, as
well as bringing both substrates in close proximity to one another. In the latter case, the more
flexible coordination sphere of La3+ in comparison to transition metals might be advantageous.

Figure 4. Proposed concerted mechanism of a La3+-mediated crossed Cannizzaro reaction of glyoxylate hydrate
with pyruvate. Coordination to the metal center is not shown for clarity.

As the Cannizzaro reaction is highly dependent on the pH of the reaction medium, we tested
the effect of different starting pH values. To suppress the reaction of glyoxylate with itself, the
stoichiometry was changed to 1:1:1 (glyoxylate:pyruvate:La2(SO4)3) and the pH after metal salt
addition was adjusted to 6, 7 and 8, respectively. NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures after
6

3 h paint a clear picture (see Figure S8). While the product spectrum of the reaction with a pH
starting value of 6 shows almost no lactate and glycolate, the lactate signals become more
pronounced at pH 7. At pH 8, the ratio of lactate to pyruvate is 1.9:1 with no other significant
product peaks, apart from a small amount of glycolate. The IR spectra of the respective
precipitates isolated after the reactions show significant similarities with lanthanum(III) oxalate
at pH 7 and pH 8 (see Figure S17). At pH 6, the spectrum of the precipitate looks almost
identical to the corresponding IR spectrum of the aforementioned 2:1 reaction after 3 h. Thus,
it can be concluded that at pH 7 and 8 the reaction becomes much more selective towards the
crossed Cannizzaro reaction with oxalate as a byproduct. At lower pH, aldol condensation
reactions are more prominent. This also highlights the importance of controlling and testing pH
for such reaction networks, also during the workup of samples. With the omission of the
basification step during derivatization for GC-MS analysis and additional analysis via NMR, we
could suppress possible unwanted reactions and better observe molecules actually present in
the reaction mixture. For example, α-hydroxyketoglutarate is no longer detectable with either
GC-MS or via NMR after addition of base.
Conclusion
The important role of metals in prebiotic reactions is undisputed.[32,33] However, the potential of
REEs in this respect has so far been overlooked. In this work we have shown that REEs have
a substantially different reactivity compared to iron in the framework of a prebiotic reaction
network based on the biological Krebs cycle starting from the prebiotically plausible glyoxylate
and pyruvate. Especially the formation of the reduced starting materials as a major reaction
pathway at neutral pH might represent an intriguing niche for REEs in Origins research. Also,
the observation of La3+ reactivity in catalytic amounts indicates the ability of REEs to catalyze
these types of reactions in a prebiotic setting, especially where a flexible coordination sphere
involving multiple reactants and strong Lewis acids are needed. Furthermore, the hard Lewis
acid character is especially relevant in the context of carbonyl/oxygen-donor ligand containing
molecules. Although many reaction pathways shown here are hard-wired into the starting
materials,[34] the abundance of REEs and their favorable properties put these elements in a
new light as potent catalysts in an OoL scenario.
