Abstract
Flaring in oil and gas production is used to combust flammable hydrocarbons that otherwise
would be vented to the atmosphere. One potential cause of flaring is intermittent disruptions in
gas supply chains between oil and gas production sites and gathering and boosting operations.
Since gathering and boosting facilities serve multiple production facilities, these types of supply
chain disruptions would be expected to cause simultaneous flaring at multiple upstream sites in
the regions served by a gathering and boosting facility experiencing a disruption, unless
production sites are able to use other gathering and boosting facilities or the production sites
immediately shut-in production. To assess the potential magnitude of this type of event, the
overall frequency of multiple flares being detected in a localized area (<5 km radius from
another flare) was assessed using spatiotemporal patterns in satellite based daily flare detections
using the VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) product. Multiple detections in a localized area are unlikely if
flaring is caused by independent conditions at individual sites. In contrast, multi-site detections
in a localized area may be indicative of potential supply chain disruptions. Hundreds of flares in
the Eagle Ford production region in south central Texas that are detected infrequently (<18%
observations) were evaluated. For these infrequently detected flares, which account for
approximately half of flared gases in the region, 87% had 80-100% of their detections classified
as multi-site events. This suggests that efforts to reduce flaring should consider impacts of
supply chain disruptions.

Synopsis: Simultaneous satellite detections, in small regions, of multiple flares that are typically
detected infrequently, suggest that localized supply chain disruptions cause significant flaring.

Introduction
Flaring in oil and gas production is used to combust flammable hydrocarbons that otherwise
would be vented to the atmosphere. Worldwide, approximately 148 billion cubic meters (bcm)
of gases were flared from global oil and gas supply chains in 20231, approximately 3.7% of
global gas production,2 the highest reported flaring volume since 2019. Multiple regulatory and
voluntary initiatives are aimed at reducing flaring in oil and gas production. For example, in
Texas, oil and gas producers must apply for a Statewide Rule 32 flaring exception to be approved
to flare during drilling, completion, and production of oil and gas and the number of these
exemptions has been decreasing while oil and gas production has increased.3 At the global
level, partners in the World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFRP),4 that
represent ~60% of global gas flaring, have pledged to eliminate routine flaring by 2030. In the
GGFRP, routine flaring includes “flaring during normal oil production operations in the absence
of sufficient facilities or amenable geology to re-inject the produced gas, utilize it on-site, or
dispatch it to a market”.5 In the GGFRP, routine flaring is distinguished from safety flaring and
non-routine flaring. Safety flaring is designed to “ensure safe operation of the facility” and
includes flaring associated with emergency operations.5 Nonroutine flaring is defined as all other
types of flaring and may have similar causes as routine flaring, such as the inability of a
downstream or customer facility to accept gas, but “is typically intermittent and of short
duration” whether planned or unplanned. To distinguish among the various types of flaring, it is
necessary to identify the factors driving the flaring. Previous analyses6 have shown that a major
cause of flaring can be the capacity, at a production basin level, to economically deliver gas to
markets. In the United States, analyses of flared gas volumes, gas production and natural gas
transmission pipeline capacities showed that flaring in the Permian Basin production region in
Texas and New Mexico was reduced by approximately 70% as new natural gas transmission
capacity was brought on-line.5 Additional analyses have shown similar patterns in other U.S.
production regions.7
While limited natural gas transmission capacity can lead to flaring, another potential cause of
flaring is insufficient reliability in gathering systems that collect gas from multiple wells and
deliver the produced gas to processing facilities. Disruptions in these systems can occur and
cause flaring even if there is sufficient transmission capacity at a basin level. Flaring driven by
this type of reliability constraint would likely occur, not at the gathering and boosting location,
but at the production sites served by the gathering and boosting facility. Flaring due to gathering
and boosting facility disruptions can also be intermittent. Partial or complete shutdown of a
gathering and boosting station would be expected to cause flaring at multiple upstream sites in
the regions served by the gathering and boosting facility if the production sites are not able to use
other gathering and boosting facilities and if the production sites do not immediately shut-in
production at the well site. Flaring caused by gathering and boosting disruptions would be
expected to be most frequent in locations where individual well sites are served by a single
gathering and boosting facility and in wet gas and associated gas production regions, where the
value of the flared gas as a lost product can be a small part of the revenue produced by the oil
and gas products.

This work will estimate the potential impact of gathering and boosting facility disruptions on
flared gas volumes by examining spatiotemporal trends of satellite detection and quantification
of flared gas volumes across individual flare sites. The analyses presented in this work will
assume that flaring caused by a production site process upset would not impact the flaring at
other nearby production sites. In contrast, if the flaring is caused by a disruption at a gathering
and boosting site that serves multiple nearby production sites, then flaring at nearby sites should
be temporally and spatially correlated. Further, it is expected that in dry gas production regions,
operators will choose to immediately shut-in production if take-away from production sites is
constricted. In contrast, wet gas and associated gas production regions would be expected to be
more likely to flare gas if the value of the flared gas as a lost product is a small part of the
revenue produced by the oil and gas products.
Analyses will be conducted for the Eagle Ford production region in south central Texas. The
Eagle Ford was chosen for analysis because it has regions of dry gas, wet gas and oil production.
Flared gas volumes will be estimated based on daily measurements available through the VIIRS
satellite product.
Methods
Study regions
The Eagle Ford oil and gas production region in south central Texas is one of the largest oil and
gas production regions in the United States. In 2024, oil production from the Eagle Ford Shale
was approximately 1 million barrels per day (8% of U.S. production) and gas production
averaged 5. billion standard cubic feet per day (>20% of U.S. production).8 The ~20,000 oil and
gas wells in the region have gas to oil ratios that range from less than 2,000 standard cubic feet
of gas per barrel of oil to more than 50,000. These oil production and gas production regions are
mapped in Figure 1a. Flare locations based on analyses of VIIRS data are mapped in Figure 1b
and are located throughout the production region, but with greater density in the regions
producing hydrocarbon liquids.

VIIRS Data
The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a satellite-based instrument aboard the
Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellites. VIIRS collects observation
data across visible and infrared wavelengths, which are then processed in near-real time by the
VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) algorithm, which identifies hot sources at the Earth’s surface and
calculates hot source characteristics such as source temperature and estimated source size using
Planck curve fitting9. The VNF algorithm detects all high radiance sources, including gas flaring,
biomass burning, and industrial heat sources. Gas flaring activity must therefore be isolated
within the VIIRS dataset.
The Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines publishes an annual flaring
dataset, where all individual detections that have been determined to be from flaring activities
are aggregated and summarized10. This dataset provides information on the location, detection
frequency, and estimated gas flared volume of each flare, which was used to determine overall
detection frequency and flared gas volume distributions. The same-day detection analysis
presented in this work, however, requires individual daily detection information in order to
assess the extent to which there is spatial and temporal correlations across the flare time series
data. This work makes use of the Nightfire v3.0 data repository, which contains all VIIRS data
processed by the VNF algorithm11. The data from this daily detection dataset must be further
processed to isolate detections from flaring activity.
Candidate flare detections
Flaring detections can be discerned from other events using temperature and location12. Flaring
events are typically above 1400K, which is higher than most biomass burning events. To identify

candidate flare detections, the daily dataset from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was
filtered for detections above 1200K to not exclude any lower temperature flares, as has been
done in previous analyses12,13. Candidate flare detections were kept in the analysis if they were
within one kilometer of a known flare location, defined by proximity to a flare identified in the
annual dataset.
Clustering flare detections and referencing VNF annual dataset
A defined-distance (DBSCAN) algorithm was used to identify clusters of individual candidate
flare detections. Each cluster must have a minimum of 3 detections within a 1km radius, which
aligns with the logic used to develop the VNF annual dataset12. Each detection within the cluster
was given a cluster ID. This cluster ID was then mapped to flare IDs in the VNF annual dataset
by identifying the closest annual flare location for a cluster within a 1km radius of the cluster
centroid. Flare clusters that could not be tied to a known flare location were excluded from the
rest of the analysis. If duplicate detections were identified, defined as detections on the same day,
typically within one minute of each other, at the same flare, only one detection was kept.
Results and Discussion
Flaring frequencies
For the 452 flare clusters in the Eagle Ford production region that had VIIRS detections in 2023,
the median detection frequency was 6%. The distribution of detection frequencies is shown in
Figure 2. Also shown in Figure 2 is the distribution of flared gas volumes reported by VIIRS.
About half of the flared volumes (54%) are accounted for by 92 (20%) of most frequently
detected (>18% detection frequency) flares. These flare detections are unlikely to be due to
periodic disruptions of gathering system operation, as frequent detections may be indicative that
flaring activity is a routine part of operation.

Estimating magnitudes of multi-site flaring events
One reason gas flaring occurs is due to disruptions of the supply chain. If it is assumed that
nearby wells or upstream facilities are serviced by the gathering, boosting, and transmission
operations, then the extent of same-day flaring among nearby well sites can provide information
on the extent to which flaring is driven by supply chain disruptions and transmission capacity
issues. Table 1 compares the relative rate of same-day flaring between nearby flares and the
average same-day flaring rate across the entire Eagle Ford Shale (Table 1).

Based on the analysis presented in Table 1, there is a clear difference between the average rate of
same-day observation (9%), and the rate of same-day observation at nearby flares only (44%).
The prevalence of nearby same-day flaring events, or multi-site flaring events can be quantified
by determining the fraction of detections that are multi-site flaring events for a given flare.
Flaring activity that was likely due to routine operation, defined as flaring sites that had an
annual detection frequency of greater than 0.18 (Figure 2), was excluded. A multi-site flaring
event was defined as flare detection that has at least double the basin-wide average rate of sameday detections across its nearby flares. Specifically, a flaring detection for a given flare is
classified as a multi-site flaring event if at least 18% (double the Eagle Ford average) of its
nearby flares (within 5km) were also observed on that day. The results from this analysis are
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: Flare detections in the Eagle Ford Shale, color coded by the fraction of events in 2023
that were classified as multi-site events. The gray detections are flares with annual detection
frequencies greater than 0.18, which were excluded from the multi-site event analysis.

The overwhelming majority of flares that had annual detection frequencies less than 0.18 also
had a high fraction of their detections that were classified as multi-site events. As seen in Figure
4, of flares that were included in the multi-site analysis (detection frequencies less than 0.18),

87% of flares had 80-100% of their detections classified as multi-site events. In general, flares
with infrequent events are often observed on the same days as nearby flares, which could be
indicative of flaring activity that is driven by supply chain or transmission capacity issues.
Similar analyses for additional production basins will be examined in future work.
