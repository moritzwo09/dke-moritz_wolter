Abstract:
N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ) is an emerging tire-derived
contaminant that poses a critical environmental risk to select salmonids. However, the mechanisms
of 6PPDQ toxicity are currently unresolved. While species-specific metabolomic effects of 6PPDQ
exposure have been explored, to our knowledge no studies have investigated the in situ spatial
distribution of 6PPDQ and 6PPDQ biotransformation products in salmonids. Herein, we employ
nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to
visualize 6PPDQ metabolism in 6-week post-hatch rainbow trout fry exposed to a 0.61 μg/L timeweighted concentration of 6PPDQ for 96 hours, as well as control fry. These data provide the first
spatial mapping of 6PPDQ metabolism in fishes. 6PPDQ was not observed in any fish tissues;
however, the primary 6PPDQ biotransformation product, hydroxylated 6PPDQ, was found to localize
in the liver and gut of exposed fry. Additionally, interrogation of non-targeted nano-DESI spatial
metabolomics revealed an accumulation of free fatty acids in the central nervous system of exposed
fry. Overall, this study uncovers spatially resolved 6PPDQ metabolism in exposed fishes and
explores the disparate localization of endogenous metabolites disrupted by 6PPDQ exposure.

Introduction:
N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ) is an environmental
transformation product of the antioxidant tire rubber additive 6PPD, and has been shown to cause
species-specific acute toxicity at ultra-trace levels.1 Identified in 2021 by Tian et al., 6PPDQ is
responsible for the mass pre-spawn mortality events and associated urban runoff mortality
syndrome (URMS) observed in Pacific Northwest Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).1 Given its
predicted global generation,2 ubiquity in urban waterways,3–6 and markedly low 24-hour median
lethal concentration (LC50) of 95 ng/L in adult Coho salmon,7 6PPDQ is a toxicant of great and
widespread concern. Environmental concentrations frequently exceed LC50 values and pose a risk
to other related salmonids, including white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis pluvius, 24-hour
LC50 0.51μg/L)8, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis, 24-hour LC50 0.59 μg/L)9, and rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss, 24-hour LC50 1.96 μg/L)9, while other fishes, such as the phylogenetically
close Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus, 24-hour LC50 > 14.2 μg/L)9 were insensitive to concentrations
far exceeding those measured in the environment.3
Presently, the mechanism of toxicity observed in salmonids is unknown. The disparate toxicological
responses among sensitive and insensitive species and between life stages of the same species are
important in elucidating 6PPDQ toxicity. Further, the ability of salmonids to biotransform 6PPDQ
likely plays an important role in its toxicity.10–12 Additionally, factors such as exposure concentration
and duration, species, and life stage are of interest when considering the abundance and types of
6PPDQ biotransformation products (bioTPs). For example, the presence of Phase I monohydroxylated 6PPDQ bioTPs is well characterized among various species.13 However, less sensitive
species exhibit an increase variety and abundance of Phase II bioTPs, including 6PPDQ-Oglucuronides, which may help to explain the difference in their sensitivity to 6PPDQ.13 As such, the
identification and relative concentration of bioTPs within various species and life stages is important
to study. While sensitive and selective, conventional toxicological LC-MS metabolomics assays of
rainbow trout cell lines,14 extracted gall bladder bile liquid,13 liver,15 brain,16 and whole-body
homogenates17 limit the observation of 6PPDQ metabolism in localized tissue subregions.
Herein, we used nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nanoDESI MSI)18 for in situ characterization of 6PPDQ and 6PPDQ bioTPs in rainbow trout fry. Mass
spectrometry images were acquired at μm resolution for technical and biological replicates of 6week post-hatch rainbow trout fry exposed to time-weighted average concentrations of 0.61 μg/L
6PPDQ for 96 hours, as well as control fry. To assess the impact of tissue matrix on 6PPDQ
sensitivity, a spiked tissue mimetic model was used to estimate 6PPDQ limits of detection by nanoDESI MSI. Additionally, the use of a high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) allows for the
putative identification of metabolites in tissue. By coupling the nano-DESI MSI platform to a HRMS,
it is possible to spatially resolve non-targeted metabolites. Localized changes in the abundance of
these endogenous metabolites could help to elucidate impacted biological pathways and tissues
perturbed by 6PPDQ exposure. Overall, this study simultaneously reveals the spatial accumulation
6PPDQ bioTPs in situ and provides a unique opportunity to uncover disparate localizations of
exogenous and endogenous metabolites.

Experimental:
Fish samples and preparation:
Rainbow trout fry care, maintenance, and exposure are described previously.19 All experiments
involving animals were reviewed and approved by the University of Saskatchewan Animal Research
Ethics Board (Animal Use Protocol 20220002). Prior to sectioning, fry were flash-frozen and stored
at -80 °C. Whole fish were sectioned to 12 µm thickness using a cryostat (Leica CM 1850, Leica
Microsystems Inc.) at -25 °C. Fry were sectioned along the sagittal plane to preserve morphological
regions of interest and then thaw-mounted directly to regular glass microscope slides (Selectfrost,
Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON). Slides were stored at -80 °C until MSI analysis.
Solvent preparation and Nano-DESI MSI:
MSI was performed on a custom-built platform, as previously outlined.18,20,21 The nano-DESI solvent
had 250 nM 6PPDQ-d5 (100 µg/mL in ACN, HPC Chemicals, Atlanta, GA), 2 µM LysoPC 19:0, and 0.1%
formic acid in 9:1 LC-MS Optima grade methanol (Fisher Scientific) in water (v/v). The nano-DESI
solvent was supplied through a primary capillary at 0.5 µL min-1 via a syringe pump (KD Scientific
788180, KD LEGATO 180, Holliston MA). Tissue-mounted slides were placed onto the nano-DESI
platform and the sample was moved at 40 µm s-1 along the x-axis and stepped in 150 µm increments
along the y-axis. The nano-DESI platform was coupled to a Thermo Orbitrap Exploris 120, with ESI
voltage set to 3.4kV and the MS inlet heated to 250 °C. MS2 spectra were obtained for 6PPDQ,
6PPDQ-d5, and OH-6PPDQ with a collision energy of 20 eV. Additionally, full scan (90-900 m/z)
spectra were collected for non-targeted analysis. All experiments were performed in positive mode
with a mass resolution of 120,000 (m/ Δm) at m/z 200. Thermo Fisher raw files were converted to
centroided mzML files using MSConvert (Proteowizard),22 and the ion images were generated from
ion-2-image software.23 Images were generated from the closest peak to the analyte mass, with an
absolute mass tolerance window of 5 ppm. Pixel dimensions were calculated to be ~100 x 150 µm
through vertical and lateral sample movement and the MS scan duty cycle.
Preparation of spiked tissue homogenates:
Mature Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) livers were obtained and flash-frozen prior to
long-term storage at -20 °C. Approximately 1g of liver was added to a homogenizer microtube along
with one 5-mm steel bead before homogenization at 4.0 m/s for 90 seconds. 100 µL aliquots of
homogenate were transferred into 6 new microtubes containing one 1 mm zirconium oxide bead. A
100 µg/mL 6PPDQ standard (ACP Chemicals, Montreal, QC) was used to generate a calibration
series, where 10 µL of the standard was spiked into the tissue homogenate aliquots. This resulted in
final tissue concentrations of 0, 0.75, 1.50, 2.25, 3.00, and 3.75 µM. Following 6PPDQ spike addition,
the 6 microtubes were homogenized again at 4.0 m/s for 30 seconds. 30 µL of spiked tissue
homogenate was withdrawn from each microtube and pipetted directly into individual wells of a
custom gelatin mold. The mold was stored at -80 °C for 1 hour before sectioning to 12 µm thickness.
Non-targeted MSI:
Non-targeted feature lists were generated from whole fish region-of-interest (ROI) masks for all
tissue sections, using i2i with the following specifications: 5 ppm tolerance, 15% minimum pixel
count, 5,000 minimum signal intensity, and a fold change of 2. Features within 5 ppm and appearing
in at least five ion images were compiled to generate a comprehensive feature list. Signal intensities
were extracted from whole-fish ROIs based on the comprehensive list. Average signal intensities

across the ROIs were obtained, and pixels containing signal intensities for the 5th and 95th percentiles
were eliminated to remove artifacts and smooth data. MetaboAnalyst (version 6.0)24 was used for
spectral analysis of control and exposed bins. A volcano plot was generated, and significant features
(p-value < 0.05) with a fold change (FC) > 2 were extracted and compiled with additional features of
interest. These features were putatively identified using Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) for
the [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + K]+ adducts and a mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Putative annotations of
metabolites of interest were confirmed through on-tissue MS2 using the nano-DESI platform. [M +
H]+ ions were confirmed for 6PPDQ and its bioTPs in positive mode, and [M-H]- ions were confirmed
for fatty acids in negative ion mode with 2.4kV ESI potential (Table S2), with a ramping collision
energy of 15-50 eV for all.

Results and Discussion:
Nano-DESI MSI of 6PPDQ and 6PPDQ biotransformation products:
To investigate 6PPDQ metabolism in situ, nano-DESI MSI was performed on whole-body thin tissue
sections of 6PPDQ-exposed and control rainbow trout fry, with targeted selected ion monitoring
(SIM) and MS2 scans for 6PPDQ and several previously reported bioTPs.10,13,17 Ion images in Figure 1
reveal that no 6PPDQ was detected in exposed or control fry. However, the phase I bioTP,
monohydroxylated 6PPDQ (OH-6PPDQ), was found to localize in the liver and surrounding organs of
exposed fry (Figure 1A). The identity of OH-6PPDQ was verified with on-tissue MS2, where observed
product ions represent the partial loss of an alkyl chain and retention of the hydroxy group at m/z
272.1154 and 259.1083, respectively.1,14 OH-6PPDQ was not observed in control fry tissue (Figure
1A, 1B, 1C). Hydroxylation is thought to primarily occur in the para-position of the phenyl moiety;14,25
however, the less abundant alkyl hydroxylation has been linked to site-specific11 and regio-specific12
toxicity. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to distinguish OH-6PPDQ isomers with nano-DESI
MSI and all data represent cumulative isomer classes. Our data suggest that 6PPDQ is present in the
fry tissue at lower levels than OH-6PPDQ, and that OH-6PPDQ accumulates in the liver and
surrounding organs in the exposed fry. Given the high ionizability and MS sensitivity previously
observed for 6PPDQ, it is possible that 6PPDQ is bioconjugating or rapidly metabolizing to
concentrations below the limit of detection for nano-DESI.
A tissue mimetic model was created from adult Chinook liver and was spiked with increasing
concentrations of 6PPDQ to estimate nano-DESI MSI limit of detection (LOD) for 6PPDQ in tissue.
The data were analyzed by extracting ROI mean intensities for 6PPDQ and the 6PPDQ-d5 internal
standard added to the nano-DESI solvent. This spiked tissue mimetic model allowed the
construction of a tissue matrix-matched calibration curve for 6PPDQ in salmonid liver (Figure 2B).
From the calibration curve, an on-tissue LOD for 6PPDQ was estimated to be 1 µM, which
corresponds to ~0.3 µg/g of tissue. Interestingly, LODs for 6PPDQ in the nano-DESI solvent while not
on tissue, such as droplet recovery on glass slide, were found to be several orders of magnitude
lower, with picomolar concentrations detected (Figure S1). Additionally, low nanomolar (50 nM)
concentrations of 6PPDQ-d5 in the nano-DESI solvent were found completely suppressed in certain
tissue regions of the rainbow trout fry (Figure S2). Altogether, the heavy signal suppression observed
for 6PPDQ-d5 in the nano-DESI solvent and high on-tissue 6PPDQ LODs may indicate more than just
strong competition for ionization or other ESI matrix effects; it is possible that 6PPDQ is rapidly
reacting or binding to biomolecules present within the liver tissue.

The localization of OH-6PPDQ to the liver, gut, and other proximal tissue (Figure 1A) is interesting, as
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are known to metabolize xenobiotics in the liver and are of
interest in 6PPDQ metabolism.26 Previously described experiments with RTL-W1 cell lines14 and
rainbow trout liver cells11 cultured with 6PPDQ and several characterized CYP450 inhibitors
uncovered non-descript CYP450 enzymes responsible for phase I 6PPDQ metabolism. In fish, major
CYP450 activity occurs hepatically.26 However, species-specific CYP450 activity has been studied
extensively and extrahepatic activity has been observed in various organs of rainbow trout, including
the gut, heart, and spleen.26 Given the extent of 6PPDQ bioTPs in extrahepatic organs, the origin of
6PPDQ metabolism is ambiguous. It is unclear whether we are observing liver-derived 6PPDQ bioTPs
perfusing into nearby tissues, or if 6PPDQ metabolism is occurring simultaneously in many organs.13
It should be noted that there is still uncertainty about whether 6PPDQ or metabolic bioactivation are
the main drivers of toxicity in rainbow trout.11,12,25,27 For example, 6PPDQ without observable bioTPs
has been shown to decouple mitochondrial respiration in RTgill-W1 cell lines,27 but site-specific
hydroxylation of OH-6PPDQ has also been shown to induce toxicity in fish.11,12 Altogether, our data
demonstrate that the primary bioTP, OH-6PPDQ, is present at higher levels than 6PPDQ in exposed
fry, and that OH-6PPDQ is exclusively detected in the liver and surrounding organs.

Non-targeted spatial metabolomics of 6PPDQ exposed fry
Non-targeted nano-DESI MSI can help to elucidate biomolecular mechanisms of 6PPDQ toxicity by
uncovering spatially resolved perturbations in endogenous metabolites. Using full scan data
collected between m/z 95-900, a comprehensive feature list was compiled for all peaks found to be
on-tissue in the imaged exposed and control fry. From these 711 molecular features, a volcano plot
was generated, which revealed 52 upregulated and 14 downregulated metabolites for exposed and
control fry (Figure 3A). Analysis of the tentatively identified molecular features uncovered a total of
seven long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) accumulated in the exposed fry as both [M
+ Na]+ (Figure 3B, 3C, S4) and [M + K]+ adducts (Figure S5). Interestingly, all of the identified LC-PUFAs
were found to accumulate in the central nervous system of the exposed fish (Figure 3C). 6PPDQ has
been implicated in disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB),16,28 which has been associated with
neuronal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and death,29–31 and may help to explain the increase in
free LC-PUFAs observed in the central nervous system of exposed fry. The specific accumulated LCPUFAs were docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), tetracosahexaenoic acid (THA), and
tetracosapenaenoic acid (TPA). Identities of these metabolites were confirmed with on-tissue MS2
in negative mode for the [M - H]- adduct (Table S1). TIC-normalized signal intensities were extracted
from whole-fish and brain ROIs from MSI, revealing an increase in LC-PUFAs across whole fish in the
exposure group (Figure 3C). Interestingly, only DHA, DPA, EPA and ARA displayed significant
abundance in the brain versus whole-body (Figure 3C). LC-PUFAs are highly abundant in salmonids,
and by weight, DHA, DPA, EPA, and ARA contribute over 30% of the total free fatty acid profile in the
brains of wild, mature rainbow trout.32 Given that LC-PUFAs cannot be directly biosynthesized in fish
and require desaturation and chain elongation of essential fatty acids,33 we also investigated
spatially resolved accumulation of LC-PUFA containing biomolecules that can act as a source of
free LC-PUFA upon enzymatic liberation.21 Specifically, whole fish and brain ROI intensities were
extracted for putatively identified LC-PUFA containing phosphatidylcholines (PC),
lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC), and monoacylglycerols (MAG). Surprisingly, no significant
differences were observed between exposed and control fry for putatively identified LC-PUFA
bearing lipids (Figure S6, S7, and S8), potentially suggesting another route for LC-PUFA
accumulation in exposed fry. ROI mean intensities were also extracted for putatively identified LCPUFA containing acylcarnitines, with no significance observed between exposed and control fry
(Figure S9). To summarize, the non-targeted nano-DESI MSI data identified accumulation of LCPUFAs in the central nervous system of 6PPDQ-exposed fry, without significant changes to the levels
of larger LC-PUFA containing lipids and acylcarnitines.
This study provides the first spatially resolved distribution of 6PPDQ metabolism in exposed fish. The
lack of observable 6PPDQ may indicate that 6PPDQ rapidly metabolizes into its bioTPs. OH-6PPDQ
was found to localize exclusively to the liver, gut, and other spatially proximal tissues. Given the
extent of OH-6PPDQ accumulation in extrahepatic organs, it is unclear whether 6PPDQ metabolism
is occurring simultaneously in many organs or if liver derived OH-6PPDQ is perfusing into them.
Additionally, non-targeted spatial metabolomics revealed the accumulation of free LC-PUFAs in the
central nervous system. LC-PUFA bearing lipids and acylcarnitines were assessed as potential
sources of these free LC-PUFAs, but significant differences in abundance were not observed
between exposed and control fry suggesting another route for LC-PUFA genesis. Further,
perturbations to LC-PUFAs are found to occur in different regions of the fish than observed 6PPDQ
metabolism, indicating that disruption of biological pathways can occur independently from major
bioTP accumulation.
