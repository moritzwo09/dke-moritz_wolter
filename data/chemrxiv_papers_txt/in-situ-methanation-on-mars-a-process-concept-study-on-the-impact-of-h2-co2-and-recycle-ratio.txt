Abstract

8

For planning return missions from Mars, considerations about the supply of rocket fuel are

9

crucial. Since transportation of propellant from Earth and storage at Mars is costly and energy

10

intensive, in situ resource utilization (ISRU) for methane production on Mars presents a

11

promising solution. The major challenge is to identify a simple and robust production process,

12

which provides the required purity of the propellant. In this study, we compare two different

13

process concepts, with and without recycle, under realistic operating conditions using

14

thermodynamic modelling and simulation. The H2/CO2 feed ratio is crucial to achieve

15

sufficiently high methane selectivity and thereby reduce the effort in product gas cleaning and

16

the overall process complexity. At the same time, recycling unreacted reactants reduces

17

resource consumption, which is preferable for ISRU scenarios. Hence, our study provides a

18

basis for more detailed process design using kinetic information on the involved process steps.

1 Introduction

23

Human missions to Mars are a significant subject owing to NASA‚Äôs and SpaceX‚Äôs vast efforts

24

to accomplish them within the next few decades. The establishment of return missions is a

25

crucial prerequisite for the recovery of human life after successful Mars missions. The most

26

promising strategy is the utilization of a Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) for transfer between the

27

surface and the orbit of Mars, while the transport between Mars orbit and earth is realized via

28

an earth return vehicle (ERV) [1]. The required fuel for the launch into the Mars orbit via MAV

29

can either be carried from earth and stored at the Mars surface or it can be produced on Mars.

30

The latter concept of in situ resource utilization (ISRU) has been introduced already in the

31

1980s [2].

32

In the 1990s elaborate plans have been made on how Mars missions can profit from ISRU

33

technology in the Design Reference Missions (DRMs) [3]: By producing propellant in situ on

34

Mars, the start mass of the mission and the mass of the lander vehicle can be significantly

35

reduced [3]. Furthermore, in situ propellant production provides more flexible surface

36

exploration capability and the possibility of longer mission durations due to the possibility of

37

refuelling rovers [3]. In addition, longer mission durations reduce the mission risk due to fewer

38

launches [3]. It is even conceivable that the necessity for live supporting facilities may become

39

redundant [3]. For example, ISRU systems include the production of O2 via electrolysis [4,5],

40

which can provide O2 for the human habitat in the event of leaking O2 tanks. Nevertheless,

41

ISRU does require higher energy input to support the operation of the required process units,

42

including compressors, electrolysis, heat exchangers, excavators, haulers, and so forth [3]. In

43

addition, the employed systems must be capable of long service live, since equipment

44

replacement requires costly transport missions from earth [3]. The DRM outlines two distinct

45

mission scenarios for a prolonged human stay on Mars: 1. A single site habitat for human

46

presence in combination with multiple exploration missions and 2. several habitat sites during

47

multiple Mars missions [3]. The latter scenario necessitates the construction of multiple

48

facilities with the required infrastructure including potential ISRU capabilities.

49

Methane synthesis from H2 and CO2, also referred to as CO2 methanation, is a well-established

50

process on Earth [6‚Äì8]. The main reaction is depicted in eq. (RE1). However, unwanted side

51

reactions may lead to the formation of CO (RE2), while CO can also be hydrogenated to

52

methane (RE3). Depending on the operating conditions, in particular temperature, pressure

53

and gas composition, and the choice of catalyst, the by-product formation can be reduced.

54

The CO2 hydrogenation reactions are typically performed in fixed-bed reactors using Ni-based

55

porous solid catalysts. The major challenge is the exothermic nature of the reaction and the

56

limitation of conversion due to thermodynamic constraints. Therefore, industrial scale plants

57

(e.g., from Air Liquide and Haldor Tops√∏e) use a cascade of adiabatic fixed-bed reactors with

58

intermediate cooling or the partial recycling of product streams for heat integration and removal

59

of the released reaction heat [6]. Furthermore, the recycle possess an additional degree of

60

freedom in process operation, which provides improved flexibility in particular for dynamic

61

operation [9,10]. In order to push the thermodynamic constraints, the operation under over-

62

stoichiometric H2/CO2 feed ratios appears to be a promising concept, as evidenced by literature

63

[11‚Äì14]. This method is particularly suitable for ISRU, since it is easily feasible without of

64

additional unit operations [11,13].

65

In recent years, NASA has conducted experiments aiming to develop ISRU technologies. In

66

one such experiment, the Martian atmosphere was simulated with an Atmospheric Processing

67

Module as part of the MARCO POLO (Mars Atmospheric and Regolith Collector/Processing

68

for Lander Operations) project [14‚Äì16]. The CO‚ÇÇ was collected via a freezer and subsequently

69

hydrogenated using 88 g of a 0.5 wt-% ruthenium on alumina catalyst to methane in a Sabatier

70

reactor [16]. During the initial start-up phase, hydrogen was supplied in excess of the

71

stoichiometric ratio (4.5:1) [15,16]. The unreacted hydrogen is recovered via a membrane and

72

returned to the reactor with some methane. After the start-up phase, the system inlet

73

composition is reduced to the stoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio of 4:1. Due to the recycling of

74

unreacted H2, the reactor inlet H2/CO2 ratio exceeds the stoichiometric value of 4:1. However,

75

no further specification is provided regarding the precise H2/CO2 ratio at the reactor inlet. With

76

a CO2 conversion of 99.9% at a reaction temperature of 450¬∞C the system demonstrates the

77

production of 32 g h-1 methane with a purity of 99.9% [14,15]. Apart from that, an investigation

78

into the impact of the H2/CO2 ratios on CO2 conversion and product purity has not been

79

included in the research's scope. Furthermore, a Sabatier reactor system is currently

80

undergoing testing on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the oxygen recovery

81

system. This system is designed to convert the CO‚ÇÇ produced by astronauts into methane and

82

water [14]. The details of the final version of the system are not yet available. Nonetheless,

83

information pertaining to a developmental version has been made public by NASA [14,17].

84

A noteworthy first extraterrestrial ISRU demonstration is conducted with MOXIE, which is an

85

oxygen production system and component of the Mars rover Perseverance [18]. Hoffman et

86

al. [18] report that seven experiments under both diurnal and nocturnal conditions yielded 50 g

87

of oxygen produced from CO‚ÇÇ in the Martian atmosphere. Thus, experimental demonstration

88

of the feasibility of ISRU at operating conditions at day and night is achieved. A further goal is

89

the demonstration of in situ oxygen production with MOXIE during different Martian seasons

90

with different ambient atmospheric pressures from 631 Pa to 757 Pa [18]. Another promising

91

concept for ISRU oxygen production is the pyrolysis of regolith, as demonstrated for lunar

92

regolith by SÃåesÃåko et al. [19].

93

A proposed timeline for Mars missions, as outlined by NASA, includes a 16-months period for

94

propellant production in order to provide 7 metric tons of methane, which is required for the

95

return mission [20]. The resulting daily methane production target is ùëõÃá CH4 = 0.91 kmol d-1.

96

Alam et al. [20] proposed a concept for production of the required amounts of methane based

97

on available experimental and simulated data. The concept was assessed at a single operation

98

point only and assumes experimentally proven CO2 conversions of 60% and CH4 selectivities

99

of 99.5% While the work clearly demonstrates the general feasibility of methane production via

100

ISRU, the underlying model is too simple to evaluate the impact of operation conditions on the

101

yield and purity of the products. The oversimplification also holds for the separation units

102

required to provide sufficiently pure methane. In a recent contribution Romegialli et al. [21]

103

performed a simulation study with Aspen Plus to estimate the feasibility of ISRU propellant

104

mass production. The authors included the carbon capture from the Martian atmosphere, the

105

water extraction from martian soil, the methanation and subsequent product purification and

106

propellant storage in their Aspen model [21]. They state that the total mass required for the

107

resulting plant design is less than 23% of the 100 metric tons transport capacity of the starship

108

[21]. Thus, ISRU propellant production should be theoretically possible with the suggested

109

plant design. While the authors used a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with LHHW-rate expression for

110

methanation over Ni-catalysts to model the Sabatier reactor. The effect of the H2 recycle and

111

the overstoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio are not evaluated in further detail. Furthermore, Nasa‚Äôs

112

research for ISRU propellant production focuses on Ru-based catalysts [3,5,14‚Äì16], due to the

113

higher activity and stability compared to Ni-catalysts [5,22].

114

Consequently, the focus of the present work is to explore the potential of recycle operation and

115

non-stoichiometric feed ratios for efficient propellant production on Mars. Therefore, the overall

116

process is modelled with the major equipment needed. This includes the chemical reactor, the

117

subsequent separation equipment and the equipment needed for realizing the mass streams.

118

Emphasis is on exploiting the impact of the H2/CO2 feed ratio and the recycle ratio on the

119

methane formation rate and the separation effort to achieve a certain product purity.

120

Thermodynamic modelling is chosen to set the scene as well as to identify the major design

121

criterions and limitations of the overall process.

122

2 Process Concept

123

The considered sub-process of this study is embedded in an overall process scheme, which is

124

depicted in Figure 1. The energy supply for heating, cooling and work intensive unit operations

125

is assumed to be secured via solar modules and not further elaborated. The considered

126

process consists of a methanation reactor, a water separation unit and a gas purification unit

127

for the product stream and is indicated by a grey box. For providing the complete picture,

128

storage units, the origin of the raw materials and the energy supply unit for heating, cooling

129

and providing electrical power for e.g. compressors and the electrolysis are also shown. These

130

unit operations are not considered in the study (outside grey box). The component streams

are colour-coded and connect the individual unit operations. The H2 and CO2 recycle streams

132

are indicated by dashed lines.

133
134
135

Figure 1: Basic flowsheet of the overall process concept based on [20], the grey box indicates the sub-process
considered in the present work.

136

In Figure 2 the process flow diagram of the sub-process is depicted in more detail. Two process

137

concepts are distinguished: the linear process variant without gas recycle (single pass

138

operation, SPO, solid lines) and the variant with gas recycle (recycle operation, RO, additional

139

dashed lines). The process consists of a Sabatier reactor (R1), in which the reactions

140

according to eqs. (RE1) ‚Äì (RE3) take place. The conversion ùëãCO2 ,in ‚àí 2 and selectivity ùëÜCH4 ,1 ‚àí 2

141

of the reactor are defined as follows:
ùëãCO2 ,in ‚àí 2 =

ùëõÃá CO2 ,1 ‚àí ùëõÃá CO2 ,2
,

142

Note that the indices used for the molar flow rates in Eqs. (1) and (2) refer to the stream

143

numbers in Figure 2. CO2 is exclusively transformed into CH4 and CO through the given

144

reaction network (RE1) ‚Äì (RE3), while the methane selectivity is close to 1. For instance,

145

methane selectivities of 99.5% are experimentally observed for supported Ru-catalysts [23‚Äì

146

25].

and dashed lines) including key and auxiliary unit operations.

152

Following the chemical conversion water needs to be separated from the product gas stream.

153

This is realized by a two-step setup consisting of a thermodynamic and a mechanical

154

separation unit. Thermodynamic separation is realized by an heat exchanger HX1 to condense

155

water out of the product stream and further reduce its vapor pressure without solidification

156

[26,27]. The subsequent mechanical separation of liquid and gas streams takes place in the

157

water separators WS1 and WS2. Unreacted educts, CO2 and H2, are separated in the

158

purification step P1 via pressure-swing adsorption. In SPO the separated reactants are not

159

utilized and emitted to the Martian atmosphere. In RO the recycled gas stream (11) is

160

combined with the inlet stream (in) in the mixer MIX1 prior to entering the reactor. The

161

produced methane is liquified (stream 13‚Äô) and stored in a thermally isolated tank S1 including

162

liquid traces of CO2, CO and H2. The gaseous part of the stream into the storage after HX3 is

163

vented prior entering the tank (stream 13‚Äô‚Äô).

164

Auxiliary unit operations, such as pressure and temperature changers, are modelled using

165

isentropic compressions or expansions, as well as isobaric heating or cooling. They provide

166

the inlet conditions for the adjoining key unit operations.

167

3 Simulation

168

For simulation, the process simulator Aspen HYSYS V12.1 is used. The software features a

169

dedicated recycling tool required for the RO setup. Table A1 (in the SI) displays the software‚Äôs

170

block types used for each unit operation with according pressures and temperatures for the

171

later discussed RO base case scenario (compare section 4.2.). Further HYSYS-flowsheets for

172

the SPO and RO setup are provided in Figure A1 and A2 (in the SI).

173

Based on the chemical equilibrium of the exothermal gas phase reaction network depicted in

174

(RE1) ‚Äì (RE3), the equilibrium reactor R1 is operated isobaric and isothermal at temperatures

175

and pressures taken from experiments for Ru/Al2O3 catalysed CO2 methanation [24], as Alam

176

et al. [5] have done for their reaction conditions. Additionally, the chemical equilibrium

177

calculation in Aspen HYSYS requires the choice of key reactions which are chosen to be (RE1)

178

and (RE2).

179

WS1 is modelled as decanter for the mechanical separation of the liquid water rich and

180

gaseous stream. Subsequently, the remaining water in the gaseous stream, stream 4, is

181

separated in WS2, which is modelled as an ideal separator set to fully remove the remaining

182

water. Those water traces can be nearly fully separated by e.g. molecular sieves with

183

neglectable methane losses of 0.78% and an H2O/CH4 selectivity of 500 [28].

184

The pressure-swing adsorption in P1 is simulated by an ideal separator based on experimental

185

data: The separation efficiency of CO2 is set to an efficiency of 94%, while the separation

186

efficiency for H2 is set to 87% [5,29,30].

187

According to Aspen HYSYS‚Äô user manual, which is accessible via the software itself, the

188

recycle tool is a theoretical block that iterates until a certain threshold is fulfilled. A sufficiently

189

high precision has been achieved by setting the number of maximal allowed iterations to 5000,

190

changing the composition sensitivity from 10 to 1 √ó 10-5 and all component sensitivities to

191

1 √ó 10-8. The error of the smallest molar flow rate before and after the recycle tool is less than

192

1 √ó 10-6 kmol d-1 (compare ùëõÃá CO2 in streams 11 and 14 in Table A2 in the SI).

193

The Peng-Robinson equation of state is used as property package in HYSYS for

194

thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, as it is recommended for systems with high H2

195

fractions [31]. Regarding the model‚Äôs applicability, the emerging operating conditions are within

196

the valid ranges of the used thermodynamic model.

197

To investigate the properties of the process and identify an operation window, parameter

198

variations are carried out. In case of SPO a variation of the H2/CO2 ratio, 3.5 ‚â§ ùëüin ‚â§ 5.5, at the

199

reactor inlet (stream (in)) is conducted as well as a variation of the molar flowrate of CO2,

200

0.9 kmol d-1 ‚â§ ùëõÃá CO2 ,in ‚â§ 1.1 kmol d-1, at the reactor inlet. The latter ranges from slightly below

201

the methane production target of 0.91 kmol d-1 up to potentially exceeding the production target

202

by 20%. Note that for SPO the overall inlet stream is identical to the reactor inlet stream.

203

For RO, the focus is on examining the impact of recycling. Here a variation of the feed stream

204

composition regarding the H2/CO2 ratio is performed at constant CO2 inlet molar flow rate.

205

Hence, the H2/CO2 ratio ranges 3.5 ‚â§ ùëüin ‚â§ 5.5.

4.1 Impact of H2/CO2 Feed Ratio in Single Pass Operation

208

The molar flow rate of methane, ùëõÃá CH4 , at the outlet of the Sabatier reactor (stream 2, see Figure

209

2) for SPO as function of the inlet H2/CO2 ratio, ùëüin , is shown in Figure 3 for various CO2 inlet

molar flow rates, ùëõÃá CO2 ,in .

flow rates, ùëõÃá CO2,in , for SPO.

214

An increase in ùëüin results in an increase in the methane molar flow rate until it reaches a

215

constant value. This general trend is observed for all CO2 inlet molar flow rates studied, while

216

the achieved maximum CH4 flow rate scales with the inlet flow rate of CO2. The target CH4

217

production rate of 0.91 kmol d-1, represented by a dashed horizontal line, requires a sufficient

218

CO‚ÇÇ feed rate depending on conversion and selectivity. Our results show that achieving the

219

target requires a minimum inlet flow rate of CO2, which corresponds to the case of full

220

conversion and selectivity (ùëõÃá CO2 ,in > 0.91 kmol d-1). Furthermore, Figure 3 shows that high

221

H2/CO2 ratios allow to achieve the target at lower CO2 feed rates, while higher CO2 feed rates

222

are beneficial in cases of small H2/CO2 ratios. This is expected, since both parameters allow

223

to compensate for conversion and selectivity below 100%.

224

Regarding the by-products and unreacted reactants at the reactor outlet Figure 4 illustrates

225

the molar flow rate of CO and CO2 plotted against the H2/CO2 inlet ratio.

227
228

CO2 inlet flow rates, ùëõÃá CO2,in, for SPO.

229

Both, the CO2 and the CO outlet molar flow rates decrease with increasing ùëüin and reach zero

230

asymptotically. The decrease in CO2 flow rate is associated with an increasing conversion,

231

while the decrease in CO flow rate indicates a rising CH4 selectivity. Both values, conversion

232

and selectivity, approach 100% for high values of ùëüin (compare Figure 5 and A3 in the SI for

233

methane selectivity), which can be attributed to the fact that CH4 formation is favoured

234

thermodynamically as the H2/CO2 ratio increases [32]. Consequently, higher H2/CO2 ratios are

235

beneficial for the subsequent CH4 purification steps, due to smaller impurity amounts. This

236

leads to a decreased equipment size and/or energy demand for methane purification.

237

Furthermore, a mass reduction of the unit can be expected, which lowers mission costs,

238

especially when considering the high mass-bound transportation costs in space travel [33].

239

These results indicate that operating the SPO process at ùëüin ‚â• 4.7 and ùëõÃá CO2 ,in ‚â• 0.91 kmol d-1

240

provides nearly full conversion and a selectivity near 1 as well as sufficient production rate

241

from thermodynamic perspective. Note that the stoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio is 4, which means

242

that the H2 conversion is smaller than the CO2 conversion for all cases for which H2/CO2 > 4.

243

Hence, not only unreacted CO2 but also unreacted H2 remains in the product stream in those

244

cases.

245

For further analysis, we selected ùëüin = 4.7 and ùëõÃá CO2 ,in = 0.91 kmol d-1 as a base case for SPO.

246

At the chosen base case, a CO2 conversion (Eq. (1)) of 99.89% and a selectivity (Eq. (2)) of

247

99.999% is achieved. The impurities entering the storage unit for the SPO base case (see

248

Table 1 together with RO results) are sufficiently low to fulfil the fuel Grade A of the US

249

department of defence for the performance specification of LCH4 (liquified methane) as

250

propellant [34]. Thus, our results show, that the required goal in methane productivity of

251

0.91 kmol d-1 can be achieved by employing sufficiently high H2/CO2 feed ratios in the SPO

252

concept without compromising the required fuel purity for applications as propellant with fewer

253

unit operations compared to the setup proposed by Alam et al. [20].

4.2 Comparison of Single Pass and Recycle Operation

263

To avoid H2 venting, the RO scenario is investigated. In Figure 5 the CO2 conversion (Eq. (1))

264

is displayed for the SPO and the RO setup over the respective inlet ratios ùëüin . In the RO setup

265

the trend in CO2 conversion is similar to that of the SPO. For ùëüin < 4, H2 is the stoichiometrically

266

limiting component. Hence, even at full H2 conversion the available CO2 is only consumed

267

stoichiometrically, leading to an increased fraction of CO‚ÇÇ at the reactor outlet and to the

268

recycling of CO‚ÇÇ. At the same time, CO2 conversion (Eq. (1)) increases with H2 availability and

269

thereby with ùëüin . For ùëüin > 4 (stream (in), Figure 2), H2 is fed in stoichiometric excess, which

270

leads to the recycling of unreacted H2 and an increased CO2 conversion. Additionally, the

271

methane selectivities (Eq. (2)) for both setups are provided in Figure A3 (in the SI).

0.91 kmol d-1 for SPO and RO.

275

As we have shown earlier (see SPO base case), a CO2 conversion of 99.9% is sufficient to

276

fulfil the methane production target and the required purity of fuel grade A. In the SPO setup,

277

this conversion is achieved with setting the ratio ùëüin to 4.7. In the RO setup, the reactor inlet

278

ratio ùëü1 depends on the ratio in the recycle streams, ùëü15, and the inlet ratio, ùëüin . Thus, the H2/CO2

279

ratio at the reactor inlet (stream 1 in Figure 2) exceeds that at the overall inlet when feeding

280

H2 in stoichiometric excess. A ratio ùëü1 = 4.7 for the RO setup is achieved by setting ùëüin to 4.09.

281

By H2 recycling venting during the purification is avoided, which leads to a significantly reduced

282

overall H2 loss (see Table 2), without compromising neither the required conversion for the set

283

methane production rate nor the fuel purity (see Table 1). From the standpoint of resource

284

efficiency, it is advantageous to achieve the set production and purity target with smaller ùëüin

285

values while maintaining the same CO‚ÇÇ inlet molar flow rate. Therefore, using a recycle stream

286

renders the RO beneficial in terms of resource consumption, while additional equipment is

287

needed.

288

It has to be mentioned that we consider the thermodynamic feasible conversion, which

289

represents the upper bound. For instance, Alam et al. [20] assumed a conversion of 60% (the

290

authors called it efficiency) at a stoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio of 4 based on kinetic experiments

291

conducted by Falbo et al. [23]. In equilibrium, we obtain a significantly higher conversion of

292

approx. 94% at the stoichiometric feed ratio. However, achieving conversions close to

293

chemical equilibrium is generally viable and a matter of appropriate reactor design as illustrated

294

by Bremer et al. for adiabatic and polytropic operation strategies [35].

295

Downstream the Sabatier reactor, step-wise product purification is considered. Since water is

296

formed stoichiometrically with methane, it needs to be separated from the raw product stream,

297

preferably in the first purification step (WS1 and WS2 in Figure 2). For the SPO base case

298

(ùëüin = 4.7, ùëõÃá CO2 ,in = 0.91 kmol d-1), the thermodynamic separation unit achieves a removal

299

efficiency of 99.62% due to the vapor pressure of water. An additional separation step, e.g. by

300

adsorption on a molecular sieve [28], would be required to lower the residual water content

301

further.

4.3 Potential for Energy Integration

303

In Table 3 the in- and outgoing (negative sign) heat flow rates of all unit operations with the

304

according temperature levels are given for the SPO and the RO setup. The operating

305

conditions are chosen according to the previous section: ùëõÃá CO2 ,in = 0.91 kmol d-1, ùëüin,SPO = 4.7,

306

ùëüin,RO = 4.09. There are no noteworthy differences in the heat flow rates and temperature

307

levels between the both setups. However, due to the recycle in the RO setup, there are some

308

additional unit operations, namely TURB2 and HX4. Due to the recycling stream preheating in

309

HX4 prior to the reactor, the overall energy demand is higher for the RO setup. The excess

310

heat of the unit operations could be used either to provide heat in process steps with heat

311

demand, like the preheating in HX4, or to heat other systems possibly like the electrolyser or

312

the human habitat.

4.4 Considerations on site selection

317

The preceding section illustrates that downstream processing can be minimized by employing

318

excess hydrogen at the reactor feed for both the SPO and RO configurations. In the SPO

319

configuration, an inlet ratio of ùëüin,SPO = 4.7 is to achieve the set objectives for purity as well as

320

production rate, while ùëüin,RO = 4.09 is sufficient for the RO. Due to the different H2 demand of

321

the two suggested setups, the availability of hydrogen at a given landing site may determine

322

whether a recycle is necessary or not.

323

Sites with abundantly available water (and H2) resources probably profit from using the simpler

324

SPO concept, which comes along with higher hydrogen consumption. Main advantage is that

325

the required number of unit operations and equipment is low, while excess hydrogen is purged

326

into the atmosphere or used for energy generation. However, sites with scarce availability of

327

H2, may profit from its efficient usage, for which the RO concept with lower hydrogen

328

consumption is beneficial. However, this process variant entails additional equipment, which

329

increases weight, transport costs, process complexity, and the risk of failure.

330

Considering the mission scenarios outlined in the introduction, the decision for single or

331

multiple landing sites affects the process configuration choice. For a single landing site, where

332

multiple crews will subsequently be present, it is likely that water and thus hydrogen are

333

abundant. Therefore, the SPO concept is the preferred choice due to its potential higher

334

reliability, lower weight, and transportation costs. The RO variant may be preferred for
15

335

continuous long-term operation at a single landing site, due to its efficient H2 utilization. The

336

higher process complexity associated higher weight and transport costs, may be

337

overcompensated by the process efficiency and flexibility.

338

In the case of multiple landing sites, the sufficient availability of water may not be guaranteed

339

at each single site. Hence, the RO concept is the preferred process variant as it is more flexible

340

and requires less water resources. Only the higher complexity may contrast that

341

recommendation.

342

5 Conclusion

343

The present work introduces and compares promising process concepts for in situ methanation

344

on Mars based on an extensive simulation study. Specifically, we propose to optimize the

345

H2/CO2 ratio and the recycle of unreacted H2 and CO2 species, to minimize the process

346

complexity and product purification efforts. We found that H2/CO2 ratios above the

347

stoichiometric value of 4 are beneficial, since practically full conversion and selectivity can be

348

achieved. This minimizes the amount of unconverted reactants and byproducts for

349

downstream processing and thereby the process complexity. The remaining separation of CH4

350

and H2 is feasible in principle and modelled by a thermodynamic approach.

351

One degree of freedom in process design is the potential recycle of unconverted reactants.

352

While it offers an improved utilization of H2, which is especially important in cases with scarce

353

availability of water, it comes along with higher process complexity. Hence, the mass and

354

associated inter-planetary transportation costs are higher, as well. At the same time, the

355

recycle concept is more flexible in operations. Consequently, both proposed process variants,

356

the SPO and the RO, are attractive options for ISRU methanation.

357

The results of our study show that propellant production on Mars is possible via two promising

358

process concepts depending and the specific site and scenario. Since our results are based

359

on thermodynamic modelling, only, additional kinetic investigations are needed for sizing and

360

estimating the mass of the major equipment in upcoming work. Therefore, combination of

361

simulations with experimental investigations establish the basis for more detailed concepts of

362

the unit operations. One of the major design criterions, beside the mass of the overall unit, are

363

the robustness of the process and the ability to provide the required propellant purity.

364

Therefore, the present study provides insights into potential degrees of freedom for process

365

design, that is the H2/CO2 feed and the recycle ratio.
