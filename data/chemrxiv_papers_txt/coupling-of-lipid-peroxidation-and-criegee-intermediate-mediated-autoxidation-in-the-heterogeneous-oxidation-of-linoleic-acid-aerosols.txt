ABSTRACT
Lipid peroxidation (autoxidation) is an established mechanism for the degradation of organic
molecules in the atmosphere and the environment. Autoxidation proceeds via radical chain
reactions involving hydroxyl (•OH), peroxy (RO2•), and alkoxy radicals, which are also prominent
oxidants in the atmosphere.
Recent reports have provided
evidence for an alternative
autoxidation mechanism driven
instead by -hydroxy peroxy
radicals (-OH-RO2•) and
Criegee intermediates (CI).
This work evaluates the
contributions of these two
mechanisms in the •OH
initiated
heterogeneous
oxidation of linoleic acid (LA) aerosols. Reaction kinetics and product distributions are monitored
using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer. To explain
the observed kinetics, a kinetic model is developed that incorporates both the conventional
peroxidation and alternative CI-mediated autoxidation mechanisms. We observe that the CImediated autoxidation pathways enhance the heterogeneous autoxidation rate, while the
peroxidation reactions, although present, contributes less to the overall oxidation rate. acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs) are identified as key indicators for bimolecular reactions
of CI with LA, highlighting the role of LA as a CI scavenger. Moreover, the measured
functionalized LA products with hydroxyl or carbonyl group(s), serve as markers for the
peroxidation reactions. In summary, this work presents a quantitative framework to understand the
coupled reaction network of •OH, RO2•, -OH-RO2• radicals, and CI in driving heterogeneous
autoxidation, which is crucial for understanding degradation mechanisms of organic molecules in
the environment and atmosphere.

KEYWORDS: Lipid peroxidation, Criegee intermediate, β-Hydroxy peroxy radical, acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxide, Heterogeneous autoxidation
SYNOPSIS: The traditional lipid peroxidation mechanism and the alternative Criegee
intermediate mediated autoxidation mechanism are quantitatively coupled and evaluated in the
hydroxyl radical initiated heterogeneous oxidation of linoleic acid.
1. INTRODUCTION
Autoxidation is a major pathway that is responsible for the oxidative degradation of molecules
in the environment. In cells autoxidation causes damage when reactive oxygen species (ROS),
such as the hydroxyl radical (•OH), hydroperoxyl radical (HO2•), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
disrupt the cellular balance between ROS production and antioxidant defenses.1-4 In the early
1980s, Porter and others5, 6 developed a lipid peroxidation (LP) mechanism centered on the Habstraction reaction from RH to produce an alkyl radical (R•), acting as a chain initiation step,
which after oxygen addition forms a peroxy radical (RO2•). This RO2• radical propagates a radical
chain reaction by extracting H-atoms from a second RH, yielding a hydroperoxide (R-OOH) and
another alkyl radical (R•). The bimolecular reaction of RO2• radicals, leading to the production of
alcohols and ketones, terminates the chain reaction. Decomposition of the R-OOH product into
•OH and an alkoxy radical (RO•), a chain branching step,7 continues the cycle of H-abstraction

from RH, further accelerating autoxidation. Autoxidation mediated by •OH, RO2•, RO•, and ROOH is thought to be the key reactive steps in lipid peroxidation. This sequence is repeated many
times leading to the slow decomposition of lipids, the onset of rancidity in foods and the
widespread degradation of organic molecules in the environment. The design of antioxidants is
generally based upon this LP mechanism and are aimed at quenching these free radical chain
reactions.8-11 In the atmosphere, RO2• radicals and R-OOH have been shown to be key reactive
species in multiphase autoxidation with significant environmental and health impacts.7, 12-14

In recent studies, however, an alternative autoxidation mechanism has been reported and
centers on Criegee Intermediates (CI) formed during reactions of •OH radicals with unsaturated
lipids or alkenes.15-17 Here we refer to this mechanism as CI-mediated autoxidation (CIMA). The
radical chain is initiated by the addition of •OH to the C=C bond of an alkene, generating a hydroxy alkyl radical, followed by the addition of O2 to form a -hydroxy peroxy radical (-OHRO2•). Based on experimental evidence for the existence of CI reactions with water (or alcohols),
which form unique hydroperoxide products, Beauchamp and coworkers first proposed that the CI
could form via the dissociation of -OH-RO2•.15, 16 Wilson and coworkers developed CIMA further
and proposed that CI-mediated •OH regeneration, i.e., CI → •OH + vinoxy radical,18 acts as a
propagation step, which significantly enhances the apparent heterogeneous reaction rate of •OH
with squalene, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and arachidonic acid.17 This conclusion was based, in part,
upon the detection of secondary ozonides (SOZs) and functionalized R-OOHs that serve as
fingerprint for chain termination products in the presence of CI reactions.17
In this work we focus on the oxidation of linoleic acid (LA, C18H32O2) by •OH. LA is a
polyunsaturated fatty acid and a common lipid component containing two C=C bonds.19-21 The LA
oxidation products as well as their formation pathways remain somewhat controversial.17, 22-24 The
main oxidation products are commonly identified as functionalized LA species that are primarily
formed through bimolecular reactions involving two peroxy radicals.22-24 For instance, Nah et al.22,
23

measured a series of these products that had one or more hydroxyl and/or carbonyl functional

groups on the LA backbone. These products are denoted LAO, LAO2, LAO3, etc. In contrast, our
recent work suggests the formation of a new class of products: -acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides
(AAHPs) produced from bimolecular reactions of CI with LA.17

Our objective is to further elucidate the heterogeneous autoxidation mechanism of LA and
•OH. The heterogeneous oxidation of LA by •OH is measured in a continuous flow stirred tank

reactor. A vacuum ultraviolet aerosol mass spectrometer (VUV-AMS) is used to identify products
and to measure the reaction kinetics as a function of [•OH] and reaction time. To interpret the data,
a kinetic model is developed that includes both the lipid peroxidation (LP) and alternative CImediated autoxidation (CIMA) mechanisms. Lastly, an in-depth reaction pathway and sensitivity
analysis is performed to quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of the two mechanisms
(i.e., LP vs. CIMA) in explaining LA decomposition, •OH regeneration, CI consumption, and
product formation.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Experimental Details
Heterogeneous autoxidation kinetics of LA are measured as a function of [•OH]. The
heterogeneous reaction is conducted in a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CFSTR).17, 25 The
reaction kinetics are monitored using the VUV-AMS.26-28 The experimental setup has been
thoroughly described in prior studies,29-31 thus only an overview is provided here. Polydisperse LA
aerosols are created via homogeneous nucleation by passing nitrogen (0.3 standard liter per minute,
SLM) through a heated Pyrex tube filled with liquid LA. Stable particle generation is achieved at
an oven temperature of 117 ºC. LA aerosols, with an average particle diameter of approximately
160 nm, are then passed through an annular activated charcoal denuder to remove residual gasphase species produced during nucleation. These particles are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) vapor, N2, O2, and a gas-phase tracer, to achieve a total flow of 1.1 SLM. The H2O2 vapor
is produced by passing N2 (0.1 SLM) through a heated bubbler (60 ºC) containing a 1:1 mixture
of solid urea-hydroperoxide (CO(NH2)2H2O2, Sigma-Aldrich, 97% pure) and sand (SiO2, 50-70

mesh particle size, Sigma-Aldrich). A flow containing the gas-phase tracer (2-methyl-2-butene,
~200 ppb in the CFSTR) is introduced to determine the [•OH] using a mixed-phase relative rate
technique described in previous studies.25
Before each experiment, the CFSTR is thoroughly purged with dry N2 for several hours to
eliminate residual particles and gas-phase components from previous experiments. Subsequently,
the reactor is filled with reagents (LA particles, H2O2, tracer, N2, and O2) in the absence of light
(i.e., no reactions). Upon turning on the UV lamps (blacklights,  ~356 nm), gas-phase H2O2 is
photolyzed to produce •OH radicals, initiating the reaction. The chemical evolution of the reaction
mixture is monitored as a function of time using the following instruments. The concentration of
the tracer, namely 2-methyl-2-butene, is quantified using a gas chromatograph equipped with a
flame ionization detector (GC-FID, SRI Instruments 8610C). This allows the average [•OH] in the
CFSTR to be determined. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, TSI, 3080L DMA, and 3025A
CPC) measures the particle size distribution. The chemical composition of the aerosol is analyzed
using the VUV-AMS at the Chemical Dynamic Beamline 9.0.2, located at the Advanced Light
Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, USA.
To measure LA autoxidation under indoor [•OH],14 the reactions of LA particles were
investigated across six [•OH] ranging from 3.0  106 to 1.7  107 moleculescm-3. A series of mass
spectra were recorded, tracking lipid autoxidation as a function of reaction time. Difference mass
spectra, which reveal reaction products, are obtained by subtracting the unreacted spectrum from
the reacted one. Figure 1A displays a representative difference mass spectrum at [•OH] = 1.4  107
moleculescm-3. From the mass spectra we can identify four distinct classes of reaction products.
First, smaller aldehydes and acids (shown in purple in Fig. 1A) with mass-to-charge ratios (m/z)

of 140, 172, and 212 are identified and arise from decomposition reactions of -OH-RO2• radicals.
Second, four acids (or diacids) with m/z of 116, 156, 188, and 228 are identified and serve as
fingerprint products arising from isomerization reactions of CI (shown in blue in Fig. 1A). Third,
peaks at m/z = 262, 378, 418, 450, and 490 are identified to be fragments arising from dissociative
photoionization of -acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs, shown in Red in Fig. 1A). Finally,
functionalized LA products with hydroxyl or carbonyl group(s), denoted as LAO and LAO2 with
m/z 294, 296, 308, 310, and 312, are observed and shown in green in Fig. 1A. Detailed product
assignments are provided in the Section 3.

2.2. Simulation Methods
Kinetiscope© has been used to develop chemical kinetic models simulating the
heterogeneous reactions of particles upon the exposure of gas-phase oxidants.32-36 This method,
which is thoroughly described in prior studies,32-36 is briefly summarized here. The LA particles
are modelled as a single instantaneously mixed compartment with dimensions 1 nm  1 nm  (R/3)
nm, where R is the measured radius of the particles to properly represent the surface-to-volume
scaling in spherical particles. The heterogenous process proceeds in three stages: the adsorption of
gas-phase •OH radicals onto the particles, leading to the formation of adsorbed •OH radicals; the
condensed-phase reactions of LA initiated by adsorbed •OH radicals; and the evaporation of
volatile components. The adsorption and evaporation steps are examined in our previous work.30
Here, we focus on the formulating a realistic autoxidation mechanism in the condensed-phase,
which is shown in detail in Table S1.
Figures 1B and 1C show two distinct autoxidation pathways: one driven by -OH-RO2• and
CI reactions (CIMA) and the other lipid peroxidation mechanism (LP) by RO2• and R-OOH. These
reaction pathways are used to examine the experimental observations in two respects. First, to
explain the formation of distinctive products, such as AAHPs and acids (or diacids) depicted in
Figure 1A, which underscores the need to include CI reaction pathways. Notably, AAHPs (colored
red in Figs. 1A and 1B) are widely proposed to originate from reactions of CI with acids.37, 38 Zeng
and Wilson observed evidence for the formation of CI during the heterogeneous reactions of
squalene and •OH radicals,39 which serves as the basis for proposing the CI-mediated autoxidation
mechanism in current model. Second, functionalized LA products (denoted LAO and LAO2) with
additional hydroxyl or carbonyl group(s) (colored green in Fig. 1A), have been experimentally
measured. Historically, similar products were attributed to bimolecular reactions of two RO2•

radicals, which lead to the formation of alcohol and ketone products.40, 41 For instance, Zhang et
al. recently explored RO2• reactions and their significance in regulating the autoxidation process,12
so these reactions in Figure 1C were proposed based on this prior work.12
The CIMA mechanism is initiated by an •OH addition reaction to carbon-carbon double
bond(s) of LA, yielding a -OH-R• radical (R1, Table S1), which then undergoes an O2 addition
reaction to form a -OH-RO2• radical (R6, Table S1). As originally proposed by the Beauchamp
group,15, 16 the unimolecular dissociation of the -OH-RO2• radical generates a CI and an hydroxy alkyl radical (-OH-R•, R8, Table S1), whose bimolecular reaction with O2 explains the
formation of smaller oxygenated products (shown as R-CO, R17, Table S1). More recently,
alternative bimolecular reactions of -OH-RO2• radicals were proposed to generate CI,39, 42, 43 but
it was found that these pathways cannot explain the heterogeneous kinetics of squalene with •OH
radicals.39 Thus, CI formation from the unimolecular dissociation pathway of -OH-RO2• radical
is assumed in the present model. Additionally, bimolecular reactions of -OH-RO2• radical were
considered, such as its reactions with -OH-RO2• radical to generate RO• radicals (R9, Table S1),
or to form a -hydroxy alcohol and ketone (R11, Table S1). Once a CI is formed, it primarily
undergoes unimolecular dissociation to produce •OH radical (R13, Table S1), isomerization to
form acid or diacid (R14, Table S1), and bimolecular reactions with LA or acid products to
generate AAHPs (R5 or R15, Table S1).
In contrast, Figure 1C highlights the steps in the LP mechanism that are incorporated in the
present model. The radical chain starts with the H-abstraction at an allylic site on LA by •OH,
resulting in the formation of R• radical (R2, Table S1). Subsequently, the addition of O2 to R•
radical yields a RO2• radical (R7, Table S1). Unlike the CIMA mechanism, RO2• is consumed in

bimolecular reactions without the formation of CI. Bimolecular reactions of RO2• + RO2•, can
produce two RO• radicals (R10, Table S1) or the formation of functionalized LA products (LAO,
R12, Table S1). The bimolecular H abstraction reaction of RO2• with LA (R4, Table S1) results in
the generation of a hydroperoxide (R-OOH) and R•, which is the propagation step in the LP
mechanism. Additionally, the unimolecular dissociation (by light or heat) of R-OOH yields •OH
and RO• radicals (R18, Table S1), serving to amplify the chain reaction. The RO• radical then
consumes LA through H-abstraction (R3, Table S1), further perpetuating the radical recycling.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 provides an overview of the evolution of LA and its reaction products vs. time at
[•OH] = 8.3  106 moleculescm-3. Figures S1 to S5 show the kinetics under five additional [•OH]
ranging from 3.0  106 to 1.7  107 moleculescm-3. The four products classes, based on their
formation reactions, are assigned a distinct color matching the labeled products in the difference
mass spectra shown in Figure 1A and the mechanisms depicted in Figs. 1B and 1C. These include
smaller aldehydes and acids (Figures 2E to 2G), acids or diacids (Figures 2I to 2L), AAHPs
(Figures 2D and 2H), and functionalized LA products (Figures 2B and 2C). These profiles serve
as a quantitative data for evaluating the coupled mechanism, which is organized into three sections.
The decay kinetics of LA as a function of reaction time and [•OH] serves as a quantitative
benchmark for assessing the overall heterogeneous autoxidation rate discussed in Section 3.1.
Second, smaller oxygenated products and AAHPs that report on CI reactions are examined in
Section 3.2. Lastly, the functionalized LA products (LAO and LAO2) produced by reactions of
RO2• and -OH-RO2• radicals are examined in Section 3.3.

3.1. Effective Reaction Probabilities and Heterogeneous Autoxidation Rates
Figure 3A shows the computed effective reaction probability (eff) of LA as a function of
[•OH] (3.0  106 to 1.70  107 moleculescm-3). Each eff is computed from the decay kinetics of
LA as a function of reaction time, as shown in Figure 3B. eff increases as the •OH concentration
decreases. This trend is a distinctive signature for autoxidation, though the underlying autoxidation
mechanism remains under unclear. For instance, Zeng et al.17, 39 observed a similar trend in

10

squalene, where decreasing [•OH] led to an increased eff, which was explained by a CI-mediated
autoxidation mechanism. Zhang et al.12 also reported an analogous trend in eff for saturated acid
particles, including adipic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, and 3-methylgluaric acid. Zhang et al.
explained these observations using the LP mechanism and by reactions of RO2•, RO•, and R-OOH.
While the former study centers on squalene, an alkene with six carbon-carbon double bonds, the
later study explored saturated acids, without carbon-carbon double bonds.

As illustrated in Figures 1B and 1C, the radical chain initiation steps in these two autoxidation
mechanisms differ significantly, with one involving •OH addition to LA and the other a Habstraction reaction of LA. To gain a better understanding, an analysis of LA consumption
reactions is conducted by monitoring its competitive reactions. In the current model, five distinct
categories of LA consumption reactions (i.e., reactive sinks) are considered, as depicted in Figure
3C. These include •OH addition to LA (R1, Table S1), H-abstraction reaction of LA by •OH (R2,
Table S1), RO• (R3, Table S1), and RO2• (R4, Table S1). Bimolecular reactions between LA and
CI (R5, Table S1), leading to the formation of AAHPs, are also included in this analysis.
This reaction pathway analysis reveals that LA is mainly consumed (~52% of the total
reactions) through •OH addition reactions (R1, Table S1), with H-abstraction reactions (R2, Table
S1) accounting for a smaller fraction (~22%). This breakdown in reactivity follows closely from
the respective rate constants. For example, the rate constant for •OH addition to each carboncarbon double bond to produce -OH-RO2• radical is 6.6  10-11 cm3molecule-1s-1.44 Therefore,
the total rate constant for two C=C bonds of LA is ~1.32  10-10 cm3molecule-1s-1. For
comparison, H-abstraction reactions of LA by •OH, incorporate contributions from various sites,
including the biallylic site (2 H atoms),45 allylic sites (4 H atoms),46 alkyl -CH2 sites (18 H
atoms),47 and -CH3 site (3 H atoms),47 with an estimated total rate constant of ~4.5  10-11
cm3molecule-1s-1. The ratio between these rate constants for •OH addition and H-abstraction
explains their relative importance, as shown in Figure 3C. Additionally, approximately 25% of LA
undergoes bimolecular reactions with CI, thereby highlighting the significance of LA itself as a CI
scavenger.

From the reaction pathway analysis above, it becomes evident that the H-abstraction reactions
have a smaller impact on the overall consumption rate of LA. To further quantify the significance
of lipid peroxidation reactions under the present conditions, a test model (designated as Test model
1) is constructed. This test model excludes lipid peroxidation reactions from the base model, which
includes the H-abstraction reactions of LA by the attack of •OH (R2, Table S1), RO• (R3, Table
S1), and RO2• radicals (R4, Table S1), as well as subsequent reactions involving RO2• radicals (R7,
R10, and R12, Table S1) and R-OOH (R18, Table S1). As depicted in Figure 3D, simulations
using this test model closely match both the experimental data and the base model simulations at
[•OH] of 8.3  106 moleculescm-3. This suggests that eliminating these lipid peroxidation reactions
have a negligible effect on the predicted LA decay kinetics. In other words, the lipid peroxidation
mechanism makes a smaller contribution to the autoxidation process of LA than does CIMA.
Further simulations of the LA decay using Test model 1 as a function of [•OH] is shown in Figure
S6.
A second test model, designated as Test model 2, is formulated to assess the importance of
the CIMA mechanism. This test model excludes the •OH addition reactions to LA that lead to the
formation of -OH-R• radicals (R1, Table S1), along with relevant reactions involving -OH-R•
(R6, Table S1), -OH-RO2• (R8, R9, and R11, Table S1), -OH-RO• (R16, Table S1), CI (R5,
R13-R15, Table S1), and AAHP (R19, Table S1). As illustrated in Figures 3D and S7, simulations
using Test model 2 predict a significantly slower LA decay than is observed in the experiment or
the base model simulations. This difference further highlights the central role that the autoxidation
mechanism initiated by •OH addition plays in capturing the autoxidation rate of LA. To gain
insights into the role of CI reactions in the autoxidation process, an additional test model 3 is
constructed by specifically excluding CI reactions (R5, R13-R15, Table S1) from the base model.

Notably, this Test model 3 underestimates the decay rate of LA as shown in Figures 3D and S8,
indicating that CI reactions promote the heterogeneous autoxidation reactivity of LA.
Recognizing the importance of •OH radicals in chain cycling, a reaction pathway analysis for
•OH regeneration is conducted, as illustrated in Figure S10. The current model encompasses three

distinct pathways for •OH formation: the unimolecular dissociation reactions of CI (R13, Table
S1), AAHP (R19, Table S1), and R-OOH (R18, Table S1). Notably, AAHPs are generated from
bimolecular reactions between CI and acids, including LA itself. Furthermore, CI can be traced to
the -OH-RO2• radical, which originates from the OH addition-initiated autoxidation process.
Regarding R-OOH, it is produced from bimolecular reaction of RO2• radicals and LA (R4, Table
S1), where RO2• radicals participate in the lipid peroxidation reaction network, initiated by Habstraction of LA. As evident from Figure S10, the primary regeneration source of •OH is the
direct unimolecular dissociation of CI. In contrast, the dissociation of AAHPs contribute less (~
10%), while the contribution from R-OOH reaction is minimal (< 1%) at a reaction time of 3300
seconds under [•OH] = 8.3  106 moleculescm-3. Therefore, we conclude that •OH radicals are
predominantly produced either directly through the unimolecular dissociation of CI or indirectly
through AAHPs (i.e., CI → AAHP → •OH). In other words, CI reactions amplify the autoxidation
process by regenerating •OH radicals, which subsequently consume LA molecules.
3.2. Fingerprint Products Consistent with the CIMA Mechanism
This section examines CI reactions and their characteristic fingerprint products. As illustrated
in Figure 4A, four distinct -OH-RO2• radicals are formed in LA autoxidation. This is because LA
has two carbon-carbon double bonds, enabling •OH addition at four specific locations, labeled 6,
7, 9, and 10 in Fig. 4A, thereby generating four distinct -OH-R• radicals. Upon O2 addition, these

-OH-R• radicals become four -OH-RO2• radicals, whose chemical structures are shown in
Figure 4A. The bond dissociation reactions of the -OH-RO2• radicals yield four -hydroxy alkyl
radicals (-OH-R•) and four distinct CIs. Following this, the bimolecular reactions of -OH-R•
radicals with O2 lead to the formation of n-hexanal (C6H12O, m/z =100), 3-nonenal (C9H16O, m/z
= 140), 9-oxononanoic acid (C9H16O3, m/z = 172), and 12-oxo-9-dodecenoic acid (C12H20O3, m/z
= 212). The kinetics of these four products are experimentally monitored as a function of reaction
time and [•OH]. For instance, the proposed reactions in the current model replicate the observed
evolution of C12H20O3, as illustrated in Figure 4B.

(C12H20O4) as a function of reaction time and [•OH].

Once formed the CI can undergo unimolecular isomerization reaction to generate an acid,48,
49

which is a well-established maker of CI chemistry during the heterogeneous reactions of LA +

O3. For instance, Müller et al.49 identified peaks at m/z 115, 155, 187, and 227 (in their
deprotonated forms) and assigned them to acids arising from the isomerization reactions of CIs. In
that study, these CIs originate from the unimolecular dissociation of primary ozonides (POZs),
generated by the addition of O3 to the carbon-carbon double bonds of LA. However, in the context
of heterogeneous reactions of LA with •OH radicals, similar acid products are rarely reported.17 In
this work, a series of peaks at m/z of 116, 156, 188, and 228 are identified to be C6H12O2, C9H16O2,
C9H16O4, and C12H20O4, respectively. Further reaction analysis reveals that these products are acids
or diacids (denoted as R-COOH), specifically hexanoic acid, 3-nonenoic acid, azelaic acid, and 3dodecenedioic acid, as illustrated in Figure 4A. This work suggests an alternative pathway for acid
formation in the absence of O3: LA + •OH → -OH-RO2• → CI → R-COOH, distinct from the
more conventional ozonolysis pathway of LA + O3 → POZ → CI → R-COOH.48, 49 The kinetic
evolution of these acids provides valuable insights into the submechanism of CI within the present
model. For example, the kinetic model reasonably explains the formation trends of acids or diacids,
such as 3-dodecenedioic acid (C12H20O4) illustrated in Figure 4C.
Apart from CI unimolecular dissociation reaction (R13, Table S1) and CI unimolecular
isomerization reaction of (R14, Table S1), the CI can be consumed in bimolecular reactions with
carboxylic acids to yield -acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs). LA is present in the aerosol in
large quantities and thus promotes this bimolecular reaction evidenced by a series of product peaks
at m/z of 262, 378, 418, 450, and 490 that are assigned to AAHPs. Figure 5A illustrates the

bimolecular reactions of LA with four distinct CIs, resulting in the generation of four AAHPs with
chemical compositions of C24H44O4, C27H48O4, C27H48O6, and C30H52O6. Although peaks
corresponding to these exact masses are not observed in the spectra, these products are instead
detected after water elimination as fragments at m/z 378 (C24H42O3), 418 (C27H46O3), 450
(C27H46O5), and 490 (C30H50O5), which is consistent with previous observations.17 Additionally,
the peak at m/z 262 (C18H30O) was identified as another fragment of AAHPs produced by
dissociative photoionization as illustrated in Figure 5A. This dissociative photoionization pathway
is proposed based on an analogous observations by Welz et al.50 In their work, the reaction between
a CI (CH2OO) and formic acid (HCOOH) was expected to yield hydroperoxyalkyl carboxylate
(HPMF, C2H4O4), but this was not experimentally observed.50 Instead, a peak at m/z 64 was
attributed to dissociative photoionization fragment of HPMF. Figure S9 offers a more direct
comparison of these photoionization fragmentation pathways.

Figure 5B shows the kinetic evolution and characterization of AAHP fragments. Notably, the
evolution of these AAHP fragments as a function of reaction time exhibits remarkable consistency,
thereby validating the photoionization fragment pathways for their generation from AAHPs
discussed above, particularly for m/z 262. This fragment peak, with its pronounced intensity above
all other AAHP fragments, serves as the representative benchmark for comparison with simulated
results, further constraining the submechanism of AAHPs in the current kinetic model. The
submechanism of AAHPs includes the sole formation pathway from the bimolecular reactions of

CIs with LA or acid products (R5 or R15, Table S1). Conversely, AAHP consumption occurs via
multiple pathways, including bimolecular reactions with •OH radicals, via addition or Habstraction, and unimolecular •OH elimination reactions (R19, Table S1). R19 is a secondary
means of regenerating •OH radicals in this system, as demonstrated in Figure S10. In other words,
an alternative propagation pathway is: LA + •OH → -OH-RO2• → CI → AAHP → •OH,
emphasizing the role of CI reactions in driving heterogeneous oxidation. As shown in Figure 5C,
the present model can reasonably explain the observed kinetics of AAHPs as a function of reaction
time and [•OH].
After carefully examining the submechanism of CI in relation to product formation, a
subsequent analysis of CI reaction pathways was conducted. Figure S11 clearly illustrates the
relative contributions of three distinct CI consumption pathways: unimolecular •OH elimination
(R13, Table S1), unimolecular isomerization (R14, Table S1), and bimolecular reactions with RCOOH forming AAHPs (R5 and R15, Table S1). Vereecken et al.18 developed theory-based
structure-activity relationships (SARs) for unimolecular reactions of CI with diverse substituents,
emphasizing over half of CI loss is attributed to the unimolecular decay. The rate constants for
these unimolecular reactions of CI (R13 and R14, Table S1) in the present model were derived
from Vereecken et al.18 Reynolds et al.38 reported that the CI + R-COOH reaction acts as a CI
scavenger, outcompeting the unimolecular decay of CI under acid-rich experimental conditions.
In their work, CIs were formed from reactions of alkene with O3, while a saturated acid (2hexyldecanoic acid) served as an additive. In contrast, this work utilizes reactions between LA and
•OH to generate CIs, with LA itself acting as a CI scavenger within the particles. As shown in

Figure S11, the ratio of unimolecular decay (R13 and R14, Table S1) and bimolecular reaction
(R5 and R15, Table S1) is approximately 1:1. This is consistent with Reynolds et al.38 and further

underscores the facile competition between unimolecular and bimolecular reactions of CI in
organic aerosols.
3.3. Products Consistent with the LP Mechanism
Figure 6 illustrates the experimental and simulated kinetic profiles of the functionalized LA
products: LAO and LAO2. For LAO, two distinct peaks at m/z 294 and 296 are observed,
corresponding to C18H30O3 and C18H32O3. The peak at m/z 294 represents LAO with an additional
carbonyl group (denoted as R-CO), whereas the one at m/z 296 is LAO with an additional hydroxyl
group (denoted as R-OH), comparing to LA (C18H32O2). For LAO2, three peaks are observed at
m/z 308, 310, and 312 corresponding to C18H28O4, C18H30O4, and C18H32O4. These LAO2 are
hypothesized to be oxygenated LA products with one or more hydroxyl, carbonyl, or
hydroperoxide groups. For instance, C18H28O4 could be an oxidized LA, containing two additional
carbonyl groups, compared to the reactant LA. Figure 6B further elucidates the temporal evolution
of LAO and LAO2 at [•OH] = 8.3  106 moleculescm-3. The normalized intensities of LAO peaks
(m/z 294 and 296) exhibit similar trends, indicating they are formed nearly simultaneously.
Similarly, the LAO2 peaks display a high degree of similarity in their normalized intensities.

products (LAO and LAO2). (B) The normalized signals of LAO peaks at m/z 294 and 296, as well

According to the traditional LP mechanism outlined in Porter et al.,1 bimolecular reactions
involving RO2• radicals, resulting from H-abstraction reactions of fatty acids, produce the
oxygenated products. For example, Nah et al.22, 23 observed a series of functionalized LA products
and attributed their formation to bimolecular reactions of -OH-RO2• radicals, which were

21

initiated by •OH addition reactions of LA. Zhang et al.51 further explored the hydroxyl radical
oxidation of oleic acid (OA), a fatty acid structurally analogous to LA but having only a single
carbon-carbon double bond. A series of peaks were observed corresponding to functionalized OA
products, consistent with both -OH-RO2• radicals and RO2• radicals contributing significantly to
the formation of functionalized OA products.
To investigate the relative contributions to the formation of functionalized LA products, the
present model incorporates reactions involving both -OH-RO2• radicals and RO2• radicals. Figure
1 offers a skeletal overview, while Figures 6A and S13 show a more detailed mechanism for the
formation of these species. Specifically, Figure 6A outlines the representative pathways leading to
the formation of LAO (m/z 294 and 296). These involve a H-abstraction reaction at the bi-allylic
site of LA, generating a conjugated R• radical that subsequently contributes to the production of a
RO2• radical. Following the pathways proposed by Benneett,41 Summers41 and Russell,40
bimolecular reactions of this RO2• radical form products with either an additional carbonyl
(C18H30O3, m/z 294) or a hydroxyl (C18H32O3, m/z 296) group. In other words, the LAO peaks
observed in this work are attributed to reactions involving RO2• radicals. As illustrated in Figure
6B, this sub mechanism for LAO production in the kinetic model reasonably captures the observed
trends in C18H30O3.
The subsequent oxidation of LAO produces LAO2, i.e., C18H28O4, C18H30O4, and C18H32O4,
as shown mechanistically in Figure 6A. For example, the kinetics of C18H32O4 (m/z 312) is shown
in Figures 6D and S12. The simulated profiles of three C18H32O4 isomers are summarized and
compared with experiment values. These isomers include molecules with a hydroperoxide group
(denoted as R-OOH), or two hydroxyl groups (R-OH), or combination of a hydroxyl group and a
carbonyl group (-OH-RCO). The reaction pathways for these isomers are compared in Figure
22

S13. First, the bimolecular reaction of a RO2• radical with RH (e.g., LA) forms R-OOH and R•
radical, as illustrated in Figure S13A. Second, R-OH is derived from LAO via the H-abstraction
reaction, as illustrated in Figures 6A and S13B. Lastly, -OH-RCO is proposed to be produced
from the bimolecular reaction of two -OH-RO2• radicals, initiated by •OH addition to LA, as
illustrated in Figure S13C. As depicted in Figure S12, R-OOH forms earlier than -OH-RCO,
which is faster than R-OH. The agreement between simulated and experimental kinetics of
C18H32O4 validates the submechanism for the formation of LAO2 isomers.
4. Atmospheric Implications
In this work, we present direct evidence for the heterogeneous autoxidation of LA, a model
organic acid, initiated by •OH radicals. The substantial increase in eff observed under lower [•OH]
signifies an increase in the autoxidation rate. Distinct fingerprint products, including acids, diacids,
aldehydes, and -acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides, confirm the presence of CI chemistry (in the
absence of O3), while functionalized LA products are consistent with reactions of RO2• and -OHRO2• radicals. To explain these observations, a kinetic model is developed that combines both the
peroxidation (dominated by RO2• and R-OOH reactions) and a CI-mediated autoxidation
mechanisms. Reaction pathway and sensitivity analysis shows that CI reactions that regenerate
•OH radicals play a dominant role in the autoxidation process. Conversely, RO • radical mediated
2

peroxidation (LP) reactions are found to also contribute be are found to be less significant. The CI
pathways form unique products (i.e., smaller acids, diacids, and aldehydes), whereas peroxidation
reactions produce functionalized LA products. Importantly, CI reactions with LA explain the
formation of AAHP isomers, consistent with the role of LA itself as an effective CI scavenger.

In the atmosphere and environment, in all likelihood, there is an facile interplay of the LP and
CIMA mechanisms, which both contribute to the accelerated oxidative aging of organic aerosols.
The model shows how reactive radicals (•OH, RO2•, and -OH-RO2•), and other species (R-OOH,
AAHP, and CI) contribute to the overall autoxidation kinetics. Moreover, the chemical structure
of LA subtly determines its multiphase chemistry, influencing the relative contributions of two
competitive radical chain initiation steps, i.e., •OH addition vs. H-abstraction. In summary, the
fully coupled autoxidation mechanism developed here, that includes contributions of the LP and
the CIMA mechanisms, further elucidates the environmental and atmospheric degradation
pathways and resulting products that could be formed during autoxidation.
