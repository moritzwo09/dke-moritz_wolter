Abstract

12

This work reported the preparation of nanostructured palladium (Pd)-based catalysts that consisted

13

of a magnetic core covered by a layer of functionalized mesoporous silica with Pd nanoparticles

14

grown in situ within the porous channels (Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd). The optimum Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd

15

with fine size and uniformly dispersed Pd nanoparticles was obtained on the amino (-NH2)

16

functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica support with Na2PdCl4 as the Pd source. The

17

performance of the synthesized Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd was evaluated in the catalytic reduction of

18

nitroarenes in aqueous solution with H2(g) as a reducing agent under ambient pressure and

19

temperature. Compared with commercial Pd/SiO2, Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd exhibited significantly

20

improved reactivity in the reduction of various nitroarenes, which were completely reduced to the

21

corresponding aminoarenes. The enhanced performance of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd may be attributed to

22

the formation of small and well dispersed Pd nanoparticles within the confined support and the

23

enhanced accessibility of reactive Pd sites within the mesoporous structure. Furthermore, the

24

Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd catalyst also showed excellent reusability and could be easily collected by an

25

external magnetic field. Results suggested that the synthesized Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd can be an

26

effective and sustainable catalyst for hydrogenation of nitro-containing compounds.

1. Introduction

32

Nitroarenes (e.g., nitrobenzene, nitrophenol, nitrotoluene, nitrobenzoic acid, etc.) are a class

33

of structurally related chemicals increasingly detected in various water sources [1]. Their presence

34

can pose negative effects on human health even at very low concentration, and cause long-term

35

adverse influences on aquatic ecosystems [2]. For example, nitrobenzene is a widely used

36

industrial chemical and a proven human carcinogen [3]. Great efforts have been devoted to

37

investigating the removal of nitroarenes. Due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group

38

on the benzene ring, direct oxidation process (e.g., Fenton process, heterogeneous catalytic

39

ozonation, and UV/H2O2 photodegradation) can be ineffective and/or require high energy

40

consumption [4, 5]. Nitroarenes could be transformed to aromatic amines and mineralized by

41

specific bacteria under anaerobic condition during biological treatments [6]. However, the

42

anaerobic process is usually slow and requires excess electron donor substrate [7]. Meanwhile,

43

catalytic hydrogenation has been reported as a beneficial method for nitroarene destruction

44

because of the fast kinetics and clear reaction routes. Moreover, the reaction products (e.g.,

45

aromatic amines) of nitroarene reduction may be used as organic intermediates in the preparation

46

of value-added chemicals such as dyes, polymers, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural

47

products [8].

48

Because of the high activity, stability, and selectivity, palladium (Pd)-based hydrogenation

49

catalysis has emerged as a promising water purification strategy for reductive destruction of

50

waterborne contaminants, including halogenated compounds (e.g., chlorophenol, fluoroarenes),

51

oxyanions (e.g., nitrate, nitrite, bromate, chlorate, and perchlorate), and N-nitrosamines (e.g. N-

52

nitrosodimethylamine) [9-17]. In catalyzing nitroarene reduction, Pd nanoparticles (NPs) have

53

been proven to be highly active for the hydrogenation of nitrophenol to aminophenol and the

54

activity was size-dependent [18]. However, bare Pd NPs tend to aggregate in water to form large

55

bulk precipitates due to the van der Waals forces and high surface energy, which could compromise

56

the catalytic activity and stability of the NPs [19, 20]. Furthermore, direct use of small-size NPs

57

may induce unintended secondary pollution to the treated water, leading to increased ecological

58

and public health risks [21].

59

Supported catalysts have received increasing interests in heterogeneous catalysis to resolve

60

the issue of bare NPs [22]. A variety of support materials have been investigated to

61

immobilize/grow Pd NPs to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity in water purification

62

applications, such as polymers, metal oxides, carbon, and silica [23-29]. In particular, mesoporous

63

silica materials (mSiO2) are widely used as catalyst supports because of their favorable features

64

that include high surface area, controlled pore size (2-50 nm), and tunable surface charge and

65

functional groups [30]. mSiO2 supports may also be readily modified with magnetic materials (e.g.,

66

Fe3O4), and the obtained magnetic nano-catalysts may be efficiently isolated from reaction media

67

through the use of an external magnet, which greatly enhances the efficiency of these catalysts and

68

guarantees the practical industrial applications [31-33]. It should also be noted that the confined

69

pore space of mSiO2 support may control the size of the in situ grown Pd NPs [32, 34-36]. It has

70

been reported that the catalytic activity of Pd-based catalysts depends on Pd NP sizes, and small

71

NP sizes promoted hydrogenation kinetics of various contaminants [37, 38]. Besides support pore

72

space, the size and dispersion of in situ grown Pd NPs can also be influenced by the support

73

functional group, as well as the Pd precursor [32, 39-42]. However, the influence of support

74

functional group and Pd precursor is still insufficiently understood to obtain fine and well-

75

dispersed Pd NPs with improved catalytic activity.

76

In this work, we reported the design of magnetically structured Pd-based catalysts using the

77

synergy of magnetic materials and fine-nanoparticle Pd reactive sites. The objectives were to (1)

78

develop and characterize Pd-based catalyst consisting of a magnetic core covered by a layer of

79

functionalized mesoporous silica with Pd NPs grown in situ within the porous channels (i.e.,

80

Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd); (2) determine the influence of support functional group and Pd precursor salt

81

on the in situ grown Pd NPs; and (3) evaluate the catalyst performance for the reduction of

82

nitroarenes under mild conditions (i.e., ambient temperature and pressure) using H2 as the

83

reductant.

(C6H4OHNO2),

2-nitrotoluene

(C6H4CH3NO2),

and

4-nitrobenzoic

acid

102

Magnetic Fe3O4 microspheres were synthesized using a hydrothermal method based on the

103

modification of a previously reported protocol [43]. Briefly, 2.6-g FeCl3, 1.5-g trisodium citrate,

104

and 4.8-g sodium acetate were dissolved in 80 mL of ethylene glycol with magnetic stirring. The

105

obtained yellow solution was then transferred and sealed into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel

106

autoclave (150-mL in capacity). The autoclave was heated at 200 °C for 10 h, and then cooled to

107

room temperature. The black products were collected and washed with ethanol and water 3 times,

108

respectively.

109

To protect the magnetic Fe3O4 microspheres from the reaction media, a thin layer of

110

nonporous silica was coated onto the Fe3O4 microspheres through a solution sol-gel method.

111

Briefly, aqueous Fe3O4 suspension was added to a three-neck round-bottom flask containing 300-

112

mL ethanol and 5.5-mL 28% NH3·H2O under mechanical stirring for 15 min at 30 °C (pH ~9).

113

Afterward, 3.0-mL TEOS was added dropwise, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 8 h

114

under continuous mechanical stirring. The resultant product (i.e., silica coated Fe3O4 nanosphere)

115

was separated and collected with a magnet, followed by washing with ethanol 6 times.

116

2.2.2 Growth of mesoporous silica shell and surface modification

117

A mesoporous silica layer was grown on the surface of silica-coated Fe3O4 microspheres via

118

a controllable soft-templating approach with CTAB as the pore-directing template [17]. In a typical

119

synthesis, 10 mL of silica-coated Fe3O4 suspension (~1 g) was added to a mixture containing 150-

120

mL ethanol, 100-mL water, 1.5-g CTAB, and 2-mL 28% NH3·H2O solution via sonication in a

121

water bath. After mixing for 30 min, 2 mL of TEOS was added to the solution dropwise under

122

rapid mechanical stirring, and the products were collected by a magnet after reacting at room

123

temperature for 18 h. To remove CTAB, the solids were redispersed in a mixture containing 200-

124

mL ethanol and 3-mL 37% HCl solution and heated under sonication at 60 °C for 2 h. This step

125

was repeated 6 times for complete removal of CTAB. Finally, the resulting Fe3O4@mSiO2

126

microspheres were collected using a magnet, washed with ethanol and water 3 times, respectively,

127

and preserved for further modification.

128

The surface of Fe3O4@mSiO2 microspheres was modified with amino (-NH2) or thiol (-SH)

129

groups. Briefly, 10 mL of microsphere suspension (~1 g Fe3O4@mSiO2) was added to 90-mL

130

isopropanol in a 250-mL two-neck bottom-round glass flask via sonication in a water bath. Then,

131

a solution containing 1.5-mL APTES or MPTES and 8-mL isopropanol was added to the reactor

132

dropwise under mechanical stirring. The solution was bubbled with N2(g) for 30 min to remove

133

oxygen, and then the reactor was placed in an oil bath and heated at 75 °C for 6 h under N2(g)

134

protection. After washing with ethanol 3 times and collecting by magnetic force, the resulting

135

Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 (or Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH) microspheres were dispersed in 40-mL water for

136

future use.

137

2.2.3 Growth of Pd NPs within Fe3O4@mSiO2

138

Pd NPs were grown within the porous channels of Fe3O4@mSiO2 through in situ reduction

139

of Pd(II) by H2(g) under ambient temperature and pressure [44]. Briefly, the Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2

140

(or Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH) suspension (~0.3 g of microsphere) was first diluted by 100-mL water

141

under sonication for 10 min. Subsequently, 3 mL of a Pd precursor solution (5 g/L Na2PdCl4 or

142

Pd(OAc)2 as Pd) was added under mechanical stirring. After mixing at room temperature for 24 h,

143

the products (Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd(II)) were collected by a magnet and washed with water 3 times.

144

To obtain Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd, the as-prepared Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd(II) was dispersed in 100-mL

145

water via sonication for 10 min and then H2(g) was introduced to reduce the loaded Pd(II) to Pd(0)

146

at room temperature and ambient pressure under mechanical stirring for 24 h. Finally, the resultant

147

product (Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd) was collected via magnetic force, dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C

148

for 24 h, and preserved for experimental use.

151

nitrotoluene, and 4-nitrobenzoic acid) was carried out in completely stirring batch reactors at room

152

temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and ambient pressure (1 atm). In a typical experiment, the synthesized

153

catalyst Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd or commercial catalyst Pd/SiO2 was added to a 250-mL round-bottom

154

flask with a desired solid loading to yield a concentration of 0.25 mgPd/L. The solution pH was

155

adjusted to 7 by HCl or NaOH and maintained with a phosphate buffer. The reactor was then

156

capped with a rubber stopper containing two 16-gauge stainless steel needles, with one serving as

157

the H2(g) (1 atm) inlet and the other as both the gas outlet and the liquid sampling port. After

158

sparging the catalyst suspension with H2(g) for 4 h, the reaction was initiated by injecting a desired

159

nitroarene to yield the initial concentration of 50 mg/L, unless otherwise specified. Samples were

160

then collected periodically, immediately filtered (0.22 μm) to quench reactions, and analyzed for

161

nitroarene and corresponding product concentrations. To test the reusability of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd,

162

50-mg/L nitrobenzene was spiked into the reactor containing Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd suspension in the

163

interval of 30 minutes for 5 times.

164

2.4 Analytical methods

165

2.4.1 Catalyst characterization

166

The shape and morphology of the synthesized Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd were determined by

167

transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi

168

Model H9000NAR and Hitachi Model S4800, respectively. N2(g) adsorption-desorption isotherms

169

were performed with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 Accelerated surface area and porosimetry

170

system to measure the surface area and pore size distribution of the catalyst and support. Specific

171

surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and pore volume

172

and pore size distribution was obtained via the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. The

173

crystalline phases of the catalyst and support were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)

174

measurement performed on a Bruker D8 Discover A25 diffractometer with copper Kα radiation.

175

The surface chemical composition and states of Pd in Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd were analyzed by X-ray

176

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Perkin Elemer PHI 5440 ESCA system with an Al Kα

177

X-ray source. The surface zeta potentials were measured with a Malvern Zetasizer ZS90.

178

Concentrations of Pd in both the synthesized catalyst Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd and the commercial

179

catalyst Pd/SiO2 were quantified by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry

180

(ICP-OES, Perkin-Elmer, Model Optima 2100 DV) after digestion with HNO3-HCl.

181

2.4.2 Aqueous analysis

182

Concentrations of nitroarenes (nitrobenzene, nitrophenol, nitrotoluene, and nitrobenzoic acid)

183

and the corresponding reaction products were quantified by a Dionex Ultimate 3000 high

184

performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a Thermo Acclaim C18 column and a

185

UV detector. The HPLC flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and a variable wavelength detector was used

186

for the analysis. The HPLC mobile phase and detection wavelength were as below: (1)

187

nitrobenzene, methanol and 3.3% acetic acid (70:30, v/v), at 262 nm; (2) aminobenzene, water and

188

acetonitrile (70:30, v/v), at 230 nm; (3) nitrophenol and aminophenol, 2% acetic acid and

189

acetonitrile (50:50, v/v), at 317 nm and 273 nm, respectively; (4) nitrotoluene and aminotoluene,

3. Results and discussion

195

3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd.

196

Core-shell structured magnetic catalysts Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd were prepared in five steps

197

(Figure 1): (1) magnetic Fe3O4 microspheres were synthesized by hydrothermal method and the

198

size of the spherical Fe3O4 core was about 200 nm (Figure 2a) [45]; (2) a thin layer of nonporous

199

silica was coated on Fe3O4 nanospheres using the Stöber method to protect the magnetic core from

200

reaction with and leaching to aqueous solutions (Figure 2b) [46]; (3) growth of mesoporous silica

201

shell was achieved via a surfactant-templating approach using CTAB as a surfactant to control the

202

pore size (Figure 2c) [17]; (4) the mesoporous silica layer was modified with amino group (-NH2)

203

using APTES or with thiol group (-SH) using MPTES after CTAB removal; and (5) the Pd source

204

was added to the suspension of modified mesoporous support and reduced to Pd(0) NPs under

205

room temperature and pressure using H2(g) (Figure 2d) [44]. Four types of synthesized catalysts

206

(Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd) were obtained with varied combinations of modified functional groups (-NH2

207

and -SH) and Pd sources (Na2PdCl4 and Pd(OAc)2).

208

sources

211

and dispersion of Pd NPs within the catalyst supports. As shown in Figure 3a, the magnetic support

212

Fe3O4@mSiO2 was successfully developed with core-shell structure. Meanwhile, Pd NPs with

213

quite different sizes and dispersions were observed using supports with different functional groups

214

and Pd sources. Based on the TEM images, the use of amino-modified mSiO2 support and

215

Na2PdCl4 as the Pd source resulted in the uniform dispersion of Pd NPs within the support structure,

216

compared with the other support-Pd source combinations (Figure 3). Specifically, fine Pd NPs with

217

sizes <3 nm were formed within the amino-functionalized mSiO2 shell using Na2PdCl4 as the Pd

218

source (Figure 3c). The TEM-EDX spectrum of the synthesized catalyst also confirmed the

219

existence of Pd NPs within the catalyst structure (Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material). In

220

contrast, Pd NPs with larger sizes and/or aggregated into larger clusters were observed for the

221

amino-functionalized mSiO2 shell with Pd(OAc)2 as the Pd source (Figure 3d), thiol-

222

functionalized mSiO2 shell with Na2PdCl4 as the Pd source (Figure 3e), and thiol-functionalized

223

mSiO2 shell with Pd(OAc)2 as the Pd source (Figure 3f).

224

Modification with amino groups altered the surface charge of the catalyst supports, which

225

played an important role in the formation of fine Pd NPs. Specifically, the surface of

226

Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 was positively charged under pH 3 – 9, while the unmodified (Fe3O4@mSiO2)

227

and thiol-modified (Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH) supports were negatively charged (Figure S2 of the

228

Supplementary Material). Previous studies have reported a similar trend in various supports such

229

as silica and coke that amino modification could enhance the positive charge while modification

230

with thiol groups did not alter the surface charge significantly [47, 48]. The positive surface charge

231

of Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 may favor the interaction and immobilization of the PdCl42- ions through

232

electrostatic attraction, thus promoting the in situ reduction of PdCl42- to form well-dispersed Pd

233

NPs. On the contrary, the electrostatic repulsion between Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 and Pd(OAc)2 and

234

between Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH and PdCl42- may negatively influence the immobilization and

235

dispersion of Pd precursor salts onto the supports, resulting in the subsequent formation of larger

236

Pd NPs and clusters. Interestingly, large Pd NP clusters were also formed and unevenly distributed

237

within the negatively charged Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH using Pd(OAc)2 (Pd2+ cation) as the Pd source

238

(Figure 3f), indicating that factors other than charge could also have a strong impact on the

239

formation and dispersion of Pd NPs. It has been suggested that Na2PdCl4 could be considered an

240

ideal Pd source for the formation of well-dispersed Pd NPs due to its solubility and the innocuous

241

byproducts (i.e., NaCl) after reaction, among various Pd salts and Pd complexes such as PdCl2,

242

Na2PdCl4,

243

tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium Pd2(dba)3, and polynuclear hydroxo complexes (PHCs) of

In addition, the Pd loadings of the four catalysts were determined by ICP-OES analysis after

246

digestion with HNO3-HCl. Highest Pd loading (4.42 wt%) was observed for the catalyst prepared

247

with Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 and Na2PdCl4. The Pd loadings were 3.96 wt%, 2.65%, and 2.22wt% for

248

catalysts synthesized from Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH and Pd(OAc)2, Fe3O4@mSiO2-SH and Na2PdCl4,

249

and Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 and Pd(OAc)2, respectively. Based on the TEM images and digestion

loading and well-dispersed fine Pd NPs, and thus was selected as model catalyst for further

252

characterization and activity evaluation in the following sections.

253

3.1.2 Characterization of the catalyst prepared from Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 and Na2PdCl4

254

A series of tools were applied to further investigate the structural and compositional properties

255

of the catalyst prepared from Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 and Na2PdCl4 (denoted as Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd in

256

the subsequent text for simplicity). The crystalline structure of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd was determined

257

by powder XRD and compared with the Pd-free supports. As shown in Figure 4a, the six

258

characteristic peaks (2θ = 30.2°, 35.6°, 43.3°, 53.8°, 57.3°, and 63.0°) in the XRD patterns matched

259

well with the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) reflections of Fe3O4 with face-centered

260

cubic structure [50]. Additionally, a broad peak occurred at 2θ = 24.2° in the XRD patterns of

261

Fe3O4@mSiO2 and Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd, but not Fe3O4, which may be attributed to the presence of

262

amorphous silica in the mesoporous silica shell [51]. Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks of (111),

263

(200), and (220) reflections of face-centered cubic metallic Pd at 2θ = 40.2°, 46.5°, and 67.9° were

264

very weak and not clearly seen in the XRD pattern of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd, which may be due to the

265

relatively low content of Pd within the catalyst (i.e., <5 wt%) or suggest the amorphous nature of

266

the Pd NPs grown within the mesoporous silica channel [17].

267

The pore structure of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd as well as the catalyst supports was determined based

268

on the small-angle XRD patterns (Figure 4b). The strong peak at 2θ = 2.2° in the XRD patterns of

269

Fe3O4@mSiO2 and Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2 indicated the presence of ordered hexagonal mesoporous

270

structure and the negligible influence of amino modification on the mesoporous structure [52]. The

271

intensity of the characteristic peak decreased in the pattern of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd, suggesting that

272

the mesoporous channel became less ordered after in situ growth of Pd NPs. Based on the N2(g)

273

adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure S3 of the Supplementary Material), the BET surface area

274

and pore size of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd were measured as 256 m2/g and 3.0 nm, respectively. Although

275

the growth of Pd NPs influenced the pore size and surface area of the support (Table S1 of the

276

Supplementary Material), our results suggested that the mesoporous structure of the catalyst was

277

retained after in situ formation of Pd NPs.

278

The chemical composition and Pd oxidation state of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd was investigated

279

using XPS. The presence of Si, Pd, N, and O in the XPS survey spectrum confirmed the amino

280

modification of Fe3O4@mSiO2 and the Pd immobilization in the catalysts (Figure 5a). Based on

281

the high-resolution Pd 3d spectrum (Figure 5b), only one set of Pd 3d spin-orbit coupling doublets

282

was observed with the 3d5/2 binding energy at ~335 eV, indicating that no Pd species other than

283

Pd(0) were formed during in situ reduction by H2(g) [53]. Similarly, an earlier study also reported

284

that Na2PdCl4 could be readily reduced to Pd(0) NPs within carbon support in H2(g) at room

285

temperature and ambient pressure [44]. Compared to conventional methods that use strong

286

reductants and/or high temperature, the result suggested that the use of H2(g) at ambient temperature

287

and pressure may be a benign and sustainable approach for the reduction of Pd(II) salts to prepare

288

heterogeneous Pd-based catalytic materials.

289

3.2 Catalytic reduction of nitroarenes

4-Nitrophenol reduction was first examined at pH 7 as a model reaction to evaluate and

291

compare the performance between the as-synthesized catalyst Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd and a

292

commercial catalyst Pd/SiO2. As shown in Figure 6a, the concentration of 4-nitrophenol decreased

293

much faster with Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd than with Pd/SiO2, suggesting that the reaction proceeded with

294

faster kinetics using Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd. We fitted the 4-nitrophenol reduction kinetics with the

295

classic pseudo-first-order model (Equation 1), which has been frequently used to describe the

296

catalytic reduction of various pollutants [54-56]:

297

𝐶

ln 𝐶𝑡 = −𝑘𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑡

(𝟏)

0

298

where C0 (mg/L) and Ct (mg/L) are the concentrations of 4-nitrophenol initially and at time t (h),

299

respectively, and kobs (h-1) is the observed pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant. The reaction

300

rate constant k was then calculated by normalizing kobs with the mass concentration of Pd (gPd/L)

301

into the reactor. Notably, the calculated rate constant for Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd (13,680 L/h·gPd) was

302

~7 times higher than that for Pd/SiO2 (1,920 L/h·gPd), suggesting the superior reduction kinetics

303

using Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd.

304

Additionally, the production of 4-aminophenol was also monitored along with 4-nitrophenol

305

reduction to determine the overall mass balance. As shown in Figure 6b, the sum of 4-nitrophenol

306

and 4-aminophenol concentrations were quite close to the initial concentration of 4-nitrophenol,

307

clearly suggesting that 4-nitrophenol was selectively reduced to 4-aminophenol under the

308

experimental condition with the use of 1 atm H2(g) as the reducing agent. It should be mentioned

309

that NaBH4 has been conventionally applied as a reducing agent in the catalytic reduction of

310

nitrophenols by Pd-based catalysts in previous studies [57]. However, hydrolysis of NaBH4 in
16

311

water was pH-dependent and may produce unwanted byproducts [58]. Meanwhile, H2(g) has been

312

proven as a clean and effective reducing agent in the catalytic reduction of various pollutants [9,

313

16]. Our result suggested that H2(g) can be efficient in the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol by

314

Pd-based materials.

315

The reactivity of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd was then investigated for the catalytic reduction of

316

several representative nitroarenes that included nitrobenzene, 2-nitrotoluene, and 4-nitrobenzoic

317

acid under neutral condition (Figure 7). Based on the fitted pseudo-first-order rate constants,

318

Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd exhibited substantially faster reaction kinetics than the commercial Pd/SiO2 for

319

the reduction of all tested nitroarenes (Figure 7d). The improved performance of Fe3O4@mSiO2-

320

Pd may be attributed to the small size and even distribution of Pd NPs within the mesoporous

321

channel. Previous study showed that the catalytic activity of conventional Pd/C was lower than

322

that of Pd/graphene oxide (Pd/GO) nanocomposites due to the smaller size and better distribution

323

of Pd NPs on GO support [59]. In the present work, the mesoporous structure and amino functional

324

groups of the Fe3O4@mSiO2 support may play synergistic roles in the formation of small and well-

325

distributed Pd NPs within the support by providing abundant active sites to immobilize Pd(II)

326

precursors and confined spaces for the nucleation and growth of Pd NPs. Additionally, the

327

mesoporous structure of Fe3O4@mSiO2 support may reduce the mass transfer limitation of

328

reactants and enhance the accessibility of reactive Pd sites for catalytic reduction of nitroarenes

329

[30, 60]. It was also worth mentioning that a good mass balance was achieved for the catalytic

330

reduction of all nitroarenes by Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd with H2(g) under ambient pressure and
17

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hsq64 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6723-7975 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

331

temperature (Figure S4 of the Supplementary Material), suggesting that the catalyst exhibited

332

good selectivity for the transformation of nitroarenes to the corresponding aminoarenes.

333

To test the reusability of Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd, we performed a multiple spiking test by adding

334

nitrobenzene repeatedly to the reactor every 30 minutes for 5 times. As shown in Figure 8, >98%

335

nitrobenzene reduction was achieved even after 5 spikes, and the catalyst could be easily collected

336

by external magnetic field. The abundant amino groups within the catalyst support may provide

337

strong affinity to stabilize Pd NPs [61]. This feature, combined with the confined space of the

338

mesoporous channel, may help prevent the aggregation of Pd NPs and retain the catalytic reactivity

339

after multiple uses [17]. Further, the magnetic property of the catalyst support may facilitate

340

catalyst recovery and reuse.

341
342

4. Conclusions

343

In this work, nanostructured and recyclable Pd-based catalysts were prepared based on the

344

synergy of magnetic materials for improved catalyst recovery and fine Pd nanoparticle sites to

345

promote catalytic reactivity. The catalyst materials consisted of a magnetic core covered by a

346

functionalized mesoporous silica shell with Pd NPs grown within the porous channels (i.e.,

347

Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd). Fine and well-distributed Pd NPs were formed within the catalyst support

348

modified with amino groups with the use of Na2PdCl4 as precursor. The Pd(II) precursor could be

349

conveniently reduced to metallic Pd (i.e., Pd(0)) NPs through in situ reduction by H2(g) in aqueous

350

solution under ambient temperature and pressure. The as-synthesized Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd was

351

efficient and outperformed commercial Pd/SiO2 for the catalytic reduction of a suite of nitroarenes

352

that included 4-nitrophenol, nitrobenzene, 2-nitrotoluene, and 4-nitrobenzoic acid to the

353

corresponding aminoarenes in aqueous solution with 1 atm H2(g) as the reducing agent. The catalyst

354

also showed excellent reusability and could be used to efficiently reduce nitroarenes for numerous

355

runs. Overall, our results suggested that Fe3O4@mSiO2-Pd may be an efficient and reusable

356

catalyst for the treatment of waterborne nitroarene pollutants under ambient conditions.

357

Furthermore, since aniline and its derivatives are important chemicals in various industries,

358

selective reduction of nitroarene pollutants to aminoarenes may provide a potentially useful route

359

for the production of value-added products.
