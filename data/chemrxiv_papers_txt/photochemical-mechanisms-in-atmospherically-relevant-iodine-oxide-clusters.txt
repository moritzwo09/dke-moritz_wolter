Abstract
Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) events can be driven by iodine oxides
or oxoacids via both neutral and ionic mechanisms. Photolysis of new particles likely
plays a significant role in their growth mechanisms, but their spectra and their photolysis mechanisms remain difficult to characterize. We recorded UV photodissociation
spectra of (I2 O5 )0−3 (IO−
3 ) clusters, observing loss of O atom, I2 O4 , and (I2 O5 )1,2 in
the atmospherically-relevant range 300-340 nm. With increasing cluster size, absorption red shifts and generally increases in intensity, suggesting particles photolyze more
frequently as they grow. Estimates of the rates indicate that even relatively small clusters are likely to undergo photolysis in ambient conditions. Vibrational spectra identify
−
the covalent moiety I3 O−
8 as the likely chromophore, not IO3 . The I2 O5 -loss pathway

competes with particle growth while the slower O loss pathway likely produces 3 O +
3 (cluster) products that could drive subsequent intra-particle chemistry, particularly

with co-adsorbed organic or amine species.

New particle formation (NPF) is the process by which trace atmospheric gases cluster
together and, under specific conditions, grow to become secondary aerosol particles via condensation of gases and/or coagulation with other atmospheric particles and small clusters. 1–3
These secondary aerosol particles can directly and indirectly influence the radiative forcing
balance of the atmosphere by scattering radiation and seeding clouds, ultimately impacting the current and future climate. 4,5 Ammonia and sulfuric acid containing clusters are
the most well studied NPF clusters to date, 6–14 having been observed in many field campaigns 15–17 as they form from direct (NH3 ) and indirect (SO2 reacting to form H2 SO4 ) 18
post-industrial-revolution anthropogenic emissions. 19
Studies performed in coastal mid-latitude and polar regions have uncovered the importance iodine plays in NPF. 20–24 I2 and organo-iodide molecules such as CH3 I 20,25,26 and
CH2 I2 27–30 are introduced into the atmosphere via several pathways, including: directly from
oceanic biota (such as algae), 25,27,31,32 from ocean surface reactions, 33–36 and from snow pack
and ice brine evaporation. 30,37,38 In the poles, photolysis of snow packs and ice plays a key
role in increasing gas phase atmospheric iodine concentrations during daylight hours. 30,38 In
the coastal mid-latitude regions during daytime at low tide, a large source of iodine species is
believed to stem from photooxidation of freshly exposed oceanic biota. 28 I2 undergoes photolysis on the order of 5-10 s as it absorbs sunlight wavelengths of 400-700 nm, 39 whereas CH2 I2
likely only undergoes photolysis on the order of 12 min to 13 hrs 40 as it primarily absorbs
in the 300-350 nm range. 41 I atoms can react very efficiently with tropospheric O3 to form
IO, 21,42–44 with reported polar springtime tropospheric ozone depletion events of 15-30 ppb,
which was predominantly attributed to iodine. 38 IO can further undergo photolysis or react
with other gas phase species to form larger iodine oxides. 45–47 These somewhat larger iodine
oxides encounter a similarly competitive fate, where photolysis leads to recycling of atmospheric iodine, but gas phase reactions can result in larger iodine oxide molecule formation
which can potentially grow into iodine oxide particles (IOPs). 48,49
Several studies have examined photodissociation of iodine oxide molecules including

IO, 22,43,50–55 OIO, 43,51,52,56–60 and I2 O2−3 , 61 along with kinetics/rates of these photolysis reactions. 62–64 Larger iodine oxides (I2−5 O2−12 ) have also been studied, probing photolysis
reaction rates and their absorption cross sections, and photolysis reactions for iodate have
been proposed. 65,66 Some of these iodine oxide molecules, such as I2 O3 , have small enough
absorption cross sections in the actinic region that they likely live long enough to play a role
in NPF and clustering. 66 IOP formation appears to be driven by temperature and humidity:
under cooler, drier conditions I2 O3 and I2 O4 are found to polymerize into larger and more
abundant IOPs. 67 A further study concluded I2 O4 is the most likely of the smaller iodine
oxide molecules to initiate NPF, with some likely contribution from I2 O5 . 68 Yet another
study identified the presence of I2 O5 in IOP nanoparticles concluding that IOPs formed in
coastal marine boundary layers are likely made up of I2 O5 . 69
Anionic species are expected to be important in iodine-driven NPF. Chamber experiments
found that ion-induced nucleation driven by IO−
3 was efficient, and suggested that in some
conditions it may be the dominant mechanism. 70 Observed clusters generally followed the
pattern (I2 O5 )0−7 (HIO3 )0−1 (IO−
1−3 ). Although neutrals are more abundant, anionic clusters
have been found to be more stable against dissociation by ion mobility-mass spectrometry
(IM-MS) during field observations, indicating these clusters could grow more quickly in the
atmosphere. 71 They are also directly observed in ambient sampling and chemical ionization
mass spectrometry experiments, though the degree to which nitrate chemical ionization faithfully preserves the composition of new particles has been questioned. 72 Furthermore, mixed
IOP containing iodic acid and any less acidic species are likely to deprotonate iodic acid, and
clusters including sulfuric acid and ammonia have been observed. 73,74 Thus, these anionic
clusters can also be viewed as likely subunits of larger pure or mixed IOPs. Despite the
findings suggesting full conversion of I2 O5 to HIO3 even at relative humidities below 65%, 71
another study determined clustering of iodine oxides was still the primary IOP formation
pathway even at high relative humidities. 47
Here we use mass-resolved gas phase ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, and infrared (IR)

spectroscopy to examine how likely and to what extent photolysis impacts iodine oxide NPF
clusters of the following composition (I2 O5 )0−4 (IO−
3 ). Performing spectroscopy directly on
mass selected ions gives the ability to explicitly link photolysis products to specific cluster
compositions and absorption wavelengths, giving direct insight into elementary photolysis
mechanisms. The experimental procedure is described in the Experimental Methods section.
While IO−
3 only shows significant absorption well into the deep UV, we find that clustering with I2 O5 results in absorption at atmospherically relevant wavelengths. Figure 1

displays survey spectra of IO−
3 , (I2 O5 )(IO3 ), (I2 O5 )4 (IO3 ), and (I2 O5 )8 (IO3 )2 from 250-340

nm, recorded by monitoring loss of O atoms upon irradiation of all clusters simultaneously
while stored in an ion trap. We have also overlaid the AM1.5G reference solar irradiance
spectrum 75 (in orange) to identify the atmospherically relevant region of the experimental
spectra, which is highlighted by the yellow structure in Figure 1. Diffuse and scattered light
is included in the spectrum, and an air mass coefficient of 1.5 corresponds to a solar zenith
angle of 48.2◦ , located at sea level in the mid-latitudes. UV light below 290 nm is efficiently
filtered by stratospheric ozone, so only absorption beyond 290 nm will potentially impact
NPF.
Analyzing the photolysis spectra, we see a very weak absorption for IO−
3 that is too deep
into the UV to be atmospherically relevant, with only negligible absorption above 300 nm.
However, the larger clusters show more notable absorption in the atmospherically-relevant
window. The smallest cluster, (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ), displays the highest peak intensity overall, but
relatively weak absorption above 300 nm. Larger clusters continue to show red shifts of these
absorption features. (I2 O5 )4 (IO−
3 ), despite absorbing more weakly in the deep UV, shows
stronger absorption at longer wavelengths, with the doubly charged (I2 O5 )8 (IO−
3 ) cluster
absorbing well beyond 320 nm. This suggests that increasing cluster size via units of I2 O5
shifts photolysis into the atmospherically relevant wavelengths.
We then sought to survey a broad range of clusters to determine the prevalence of this
photolysis mechanism. We recorded a series of mass spectra in the mass range of 30-2060

m/z, with and without 300 nm laser light. Figure 2 shows a plot of difference mass spectra
for absorption at 300 nm, calculated by subtracting the steady state mass spectrum with
the laser on from that when the laser is blocked. The positive intensities, therefore, identify
cluster compositions with increased population upon 300 nm irradiation and the negative
intensities establish clusters that are depleted. Artifacts resulting from changes in peak
shape are noted by a red *. All clusters of the composition (I2 O5 )n>1 (IO−
3 ) appear to
undergo fragmentation upon exposure to UV light. However, I2 O4 (I2 O5 )n≥1 (IO−
3 ) cluster
yields, representing the O loss channel from the (I2 O5 )n>1 (IO−
3 ) clusters, are not enhanced
proportionally to the depletion of the parent, consistent with the coexistence of fragmentation
channels yielding loss of (I2 O5 )n≥1 . The positive IO−
4 fragment intensity in Figure 2 indicates
I2 O4 loss from the (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ) cluster. Recording spectra in this manner makes it difficult
to directly observe the (I2 O5 )-loss channel, necessitating an alternate experimental modality.
In order to quantify the relative yields of the O loss and I2 O5 loss channels, we instead
recorded spectra by mass selecting a single cluster composition by linear time of flight mass
spectrometry, irradiating it with a tunable laser pulse, and mass separating the fragments by
reflectron time of flight mass spectrometry. The spectra collected in this manner are displayed
−
−
in Figure 3 for the following clusters: (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ), (I2 O5 )2 (IO3 ), and (I2 O5 )3 (IO3 ). In all

cases, we find that fragmentation results in more I2 O5 loss than O loss by roughly a factor of
10. For (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ), absorption occurs up to approximately 320 nm, regardless of photolysis
product. Photolysis of (I2 O5 )2 (IO−
3 ) to produce I2 O5 occurs up to 340 nm, while loss of O
is not apparent beyond 320 nm. There are three distinct product channels detected for
(I2 O5 )3 (IO−
3 ): loss of O, I2 O5 , and (I2 O5 )2 , each with an apparent maximum absorption
wavelength of 325 nm. However, it is impossible to identify whether the latter results from
loss of 2I2 O5 or I4 O10 .
While quantification of the absolute photolysis rates is difficult in the current experimental setup, we present conservative lower limits to these rates in Table 1 only to estimate the
degree to which photochemistry of this type is likely to be relevant to NPF. More careful

kinetic measurements would be required to establish quantitative rates that could be incorporated into models. The calculation of these rates is described in the Supplementary
Information, but briefly, we integrated the product of the experimental fragment yields (divided by photon flux) and the AM1.5G solar spectrum. Fragment yields are scaled to the
O-loss fragment yield for (I2 O5 )2 (IO−
3 ), which was recorded with high signal to noise. We
expect these rates to be lower bounds to the atmospheric rates because the AM1.5G reference spectrum is intended to represent a “typical” day in a terrestrial mid-latitude location
at sea level. On a high-UV, low-ozone day in tropical coastal regions at altitude, the observed rates for clusters such as these are likely to be significantly higher, possibly by an
order of magnitude. More sophisticated models to predict solar irradiance are available, but
given the large experimental uncertainties in these measurements, we chose to simplify our
analysis. Particularly due to the large contribution of baseline noise to the total integral at
longer (higher UV flux) wavelengths, we anticipate relative uncertainties of 25% and absolute
uncertainties of 50%.

Analyzing the results, it is likely that photolysis of IO−
3 to yield loss of oxygen is too slow
to significantly alter NPF mechanisms at any plausible UV solar irradiance. For clusters, we
see photolysis by O loss to increase at least linearly with addition of I2 O5 , and on a high-UV
day, O loss from (I2 O5 )3 (IO−
3 ) and larger clusters could be expected to occur in a matter of
minutes. In all cases, photolysis yielding I2 O5 is roughly an order of magnitude faster than
loss of O. This process would simply compete with uptake of I2 O5 , while loss of O atoms will

qualitatively change the chemistry of the nascent particle. These rates are of similar orders
of magnitude to those presented for smaller iodine oxides, 66 suggesting that photochemistry
in more complex mixed new particles is likely to continue to be relevant.
Next, we sought to determine the nature of the chromophore responsible for UV absorption. We recorded vibrational spectra of the clusters (I2 O5 )1−3 (IO−
3 ) using cryogenic
ion vibrational presdissociation spectroscopy (CIVP). 76 CIVP spectroscopy allows the vibrational spectra of clusters with specific compositions to be recorded. Thus, it is possible
to establish experimentally present structures by comparing quantum-chemically-computed
vibrational spectra for a number of structures to the experimental spectra. The experimental spectra are shown in black, and the computed spectra for the lowest energy isomers are
shown in grey in Figure 4. The approach to generate the computed spectra was validated previously for clusters of this type 74 and is described in the Experimental Methods. The lowest
energy optimized structures are shown alongside their corresponding computed spectra and
their 0 K, zero-point-corrected internal energies. We explored previously reported structures
of these cluster compositions 71 as well as derivatives of ones we previously reported 74 as a
starting point for structure generation. Further candidate structures were developed using
chemical intuition, and all were optimized to local minima. While this approach does not
exhaustively explore the structural space available to these clusters, it is sufficient to identify
the structural motif associated with the UV chromophore.
For the (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ) cluster, we find two nearly isoenergetic structures. The computed
spectrum of isomer 1a shows very good agreement with the experimental spectrum, reproducing the three peaks in the 800-900 cm−1 range nearly quantitatively. It also captures the
position of the peak near 700 cm−1 accurately. The intensity of this peak is likely suppressed
in the experimental spectrum due to the binding energy of the N2 adduct. This binding energy is typically ∼800 cm−1 , so a single photon of less than 800 cm−1 is not always sufficient
to induce tag dissociation. The spectrum of isomer 1c 71 is also broadly consistent with the
experimental spectrum, but the relative intensity patterns and peak positions in the 800-900

assign structures 1a and 2b as the experimentally-present structures. None of the current
computed spectra satisfactorily replicate the experimentally present one, but similarities
−
between the experimental spectra of (I2 O5 )2 (IO−

structures for these clusters.

cm−1 range display a worse match than Isomer 1a. Isomer 1c is also significantly higher in
energy; as a result we do not expect it to be present in the experiment.
Moving to the next bigger cluster, (I2 O5 )2 (IO−
3 ), we identify the second lowest energy
structure, 2b, as the most likely experimentally present structure. Although it is slightly
higher in energy than isomer 1a, the energy difference is still within the expected uncertainty
of the calculation. It best reproduces the doublet-singlet pattern found around 800 cm−1
in the experimental spectrum as well as the spacing of the three peaks below 700 cm−1 .
Again, we expect the relative intensities of the peaks below 700 cm−1 to be suppressed in
the experimental spectra due to N2 binding energy.
In both of these assigned clusters, it is apparent from the structures that an I3 O−
8 molecule
is present. We previously showed that a covalently-bound I3 O−
8 forms in cationic clusters consisting of ammonia, iodic acid, and iodine pentoxide. 74 This suggests that the actual compo−
−
sition of these clusters is best described as (I3 O−
8 ) and (I3 O8 )(I2 O5 ) rather than (I2 O5 )(IO3 )
−
and (I2 O5 )2 (IO−
3 ), respectively. These structural assignments lead us to conclude that I3 O8

is the UV chromophore driving the photochemistry discussed above. The absorption of IO−
3
is weak and shifted well into atmospherically-irrelevant range of the UV near 260 nm, while
−
I3 O−
8 and (I3 O8 )(I2 O5 ) absorb strongly and with notable intensity above 300 nm.

None of the calculations for (I2 O5 )3 (IO−
3 ) capture the experimental spectrum satisfactorily. Given the size and complexity of the cluster, identification of the global minimum
structure is a significant challenge. Nonetheless, comparison of the experimental spectrum
−
of (I2 O5 )3 (IO−
3 ) and (I2 O5 )2 (IO3 ) shows striking similarities, particularly with respect to the

peaks between 750-850 cm−1 , suggesting structural similarities. Analyzing the two lowest
energy computed structures, we again find an I3 O−
8 moiety, and in the slightly higher energy
structure a single fully covalently-bound structure can be found. These two pieces of evidence suggest that I3 O−
8 remains a structural feature of this cluster and continues to drive
photolysis.
Next, we aimed to understand the photolysis mechanism, mainly 1.) whether dissociation

happens on the ground or excited electronic states, and 2.) whether it produces triplet or
singlet oxygen. We first performed collision induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry
experiments on these clusters using a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer
(Figures S1-S5). CID experiments are expected to drive fragmentation via a ground state
mechanism, thermal decomposition. In all cases we observe decomposition by loss of I2 O5
molecules, with no evidence of loss of O atoms. We cannot rule out the possibility that O
atom loss occurs on a very hot ground state resulting from internal conversion, but the CID
results suggest that O atom loss occurs through an excited state mechanism. However, it
does not allow us to determine whether it results from direct photodissocation or from more
complex excited state dynamics.
Finally, we focused on identifying whether O atom fragmentation yields 1 O or 3 O, and
by extension, a singlet or triplet fragment cluster, respectively. 1 O is more reactive than
3

O, though either could subsequently drive further intracluster reactions. If 3 O is formed,

presumably via singlet fission mechanism, 77 a triplet cluster fragment is left behind that is
likely much more reactive than a singlet cluster fragment, potentially resulting in intracluster
reactions either directly or by release of internal energy upon intersystem crossing back
to the singlet state. Since these experiments do not provide direct evidence of the spin
states, we performed several quantum chemical calculations comparing singlet and triplet
cluster energies for our smallest cluster (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ). Our goal was simply to determine the
energetic ordering of the spin channels and whether one or both were energetically available
at atmospherically-relevant wavelengths.
We removed O atoms at each unique site and optimized the geometry of the remaining
cluster in both the singlet and triplet states. The energy of (I2 O5 )(IO−
3 ) was subtracted
from the sum of the energies of the corresponding singlet or triplet O atom and remaining
cluster, yielding the theoretical onset energy of O loss photofragmentation via the singlet
or triplet channel. Since these are open-shell calculations, they were performed at two
levels of theory: unrestricted open shell and restricted- open shell. Reported computed

energy differences for each level of theory are displayed in Tables S1 and S2 respectively.
We find that both approaches provide similar results, with the 1 O loss channels requiring
approximately 5.29-5.47 eV of energy and the 3 O loss channels only requiring 3.43-4.39 eV
of energy to facilitate O loss. At the photon energies in this experiment of 3.65-4.27 eV
(290-340 nm), these calculations suggest that it is energetically impossible to access the 1 O
+ 1 (cluster). Therefore, we assign photolysis of these clusters to a mechanism resulting in
production of an 3 O fragment and a 3 (cluster).
From these results we can draw some broader inferences about the role of photochemistry in laboratory and ambient NPF studies. First, it is clear that the photoproducts
resulting from UV absorption will depend substantially on the power spectrum of the excitation light source, particularly in the region near 300 nm where these clusters begin to absorb
significantly. Narrowband laser-like sources, particularly deeper in the non-atmosphericallyrelevant UV region, may drive non-atmospherically-relevant relative yields of photofragments. Even broadband light sources that do not closely mirror the solar spectrum may
induce significant deviations from the ambient abundances of similar clusters due to the
sharp turn on of absorption near the atmospheric window. Promotion of the O loss fragmentation channel, in particular, will change the chemical composition of the particle, namely
the I:O ratio, while loss of I2 O5 can be viewed more simply as suppressing growth. Second,
even for new particles of only a few nanometers in relatively pristine environments, particle
composition is likely to include bases or organics. 78 The fact that fragmentation can yield 3 O
atoms and 3 (cluster) suggests that photoinduced intraparticle chemistry may be common and
may play an important role in the fate of new particles containing iodine. Finally, coupling
between organic and iodine oxide/iodic acid components of new particles may qualitatively
perturb their spectra, borrowing intensity from the strong absorption of the iodine oxides
but red shifting their spectra further into the atmospherically relevant range. In this case,
the role of photochemistry in new particle evolution would likely be even more pronounced.
In summary, we have found that clusters of the (I2 O5 )n (IO−
3 ) family photofragment by

loss of O, I2 O5 , and I2 O4 . Clusters of increasing size appear to absorb progressively more in
the atmospherically relevant region of the UV as they grow, with the larger clusters studied
here absorbing up to 340 nm. We also identified the presence of I3 O−
8 in all of the clusters
studied using IR spectroscopy, and ultimately identified the cluster chromophore to be I3 O−
8
rather than IO−
3 . Photolysis resulting in loss of I2 O5 is roughly 10 times faster than O loss
fragmentation. O loss likely results in 3 O + 3 (cluster), hence intra-cluster chemical reactions
are likely to ensue for more complex mixed-composition clusters containing organics. The
rich photochemistry of iodine oxide-containing clusters may play a significant role in iodinebased NPF.
Experimental Methods
All mass spectra, IR spectra, and UV spectra discussed in this work were collected on a
home-built guided ion beam/ion trap/tandem time-of-flight (TOF) photofragmentation mass
spectrometer discussed in detail previously. 11 The anionic clusters analyzed here are formed
via electrospray ionization (ESI) of a solution of 5 mM iodic acid in 50/50 water/methanol
into an atmospherically-isolated capsule region. The ions are then guided to a cryogenically
cooled octopole ion trap (cooled by Sumitomo RDK-408D2 cold head), where they are collisionally cooled with pulsed helium gas. For the mass spectra and UV spectra in Figures 1 and
2, this trap remained at 300K. A laser beam path bisects the trap longitudinally, following
the trajectory of the ions. The ions are then orthogonally accelerated and analyzed by time
of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. Tunable UV light was produced by two custom-built
optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (LaserVision), which was pumped with 1064nm pump
light at a 10 Hz repetition rate, produced by a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite EX). The
signal of the OPO was doubled, yielding the scannable range of 250-340 nm.
For spectra displayed in Figure 3, UV light was generated through sum frequency generation (SFG) of the signal from a similar tunable OPO and the 1064 nm pump light produced
by another Continuum Surelite EX laser. Ions were mass selected in the TOF and irradiated

the photofragments from the non-fragmented ions.
The IR spectra were collected at the TOF laser crossing, where tunable IR laser light
was produced by an OPO/OPA system (LaserVision) pumped by another Surelite EX. The
main difference between the collection processes of the UV and IR spectra results from the
CIVP messenger tagging process. For collection of UV spectra, no messenger tags were used.
IR spectra were computed from the ratio of untagged ions to the sum of tagged and
untagged ions multiplied by laser power, as a function of wavelength. UV spectra displayed
in Figure 1, were computed by dividing the integrated intensity of fragment ions by the
sum of the integrated intensity of fragment and parent ions and then divided by the measured laser pulse energy. UV spectra reported in Figure 3 are recorded by monitoring the
photofragment only, as it is not possible for the reflectron to focus both fragment and parent
ions simultaneously for all fragments due to their kinetic energy differences. This reduction
in kinetic energy also results in reduced detection efficiency of the fragments. A method to
correct for this effect is described in the Supplementary Information.
Density functional theory calculations were performed at the CAM-B3LYP level of theory,
with a split basis set of aug-cc-pVDZ on light atoms and Def2-SV(P) on iodine for all closed
shell calculations, using the Gaussian 16 suite of programs. 79 This approach was previously
validated for clusters of similar compositions. 74 All open shell calculations were performed
using the same basis sets, however, we used both UCAM-B3LYP and ROCAM-B3LYP levels
of theory to compare results. All spectra from harmonic frequency calculations are presented
without scaling, and all relative energies include zero-point energy.
