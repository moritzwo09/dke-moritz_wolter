ABSTRACT

2

Varying and sometimes conflicting temperatures and products have been reported from

3

studies addressing thermal PFAS destruction, often because decomposition pathways are highly

4

dependent on the respective experimental system. Here we applied highest-level coupled cluster

5

calculations to isolate and identify the major processes during thermal PFAS destruction in the gas

6

phase with relevance to incineration, thermal oxidation, and other thermal treatment technologies

7

in which PFAS and their volatile decomposition products desorb into the gas phase. All

8

investigated perfluoroalkyl acids decompose via unimolecular head group loss, either through HF

9

elimination or homolytic bond cleavage as a function of head group type. In contrast, all

10

investigated fluorotelomers undergo initial hydrogen abstraction from the characteristic C2H4

11

moiety by hydroxyl radicals under representative incineration conditions, followed by radical

12

decomposition. Subsequent formation of perfluoroalkanes including CF4 can then be prevented by

13

supplying sufficient hydrogen donors such as hydrocarbon fuel and water as well as by scavenging

14

released fluorine. This leads to the generation of stable 1H-perfluoroalkanes. While parent PFAS

15

decomposition proceeds at gas-phase temperatures ≤700 °C, carbon-carbon cleavage of 1H-

16

perfluoroalkanes requires up to ~950 °C at 2 seconds gas residence time, making this step the

17

kinetic bottleneck on the way to complete thermal PFAS mineralization.

INTRODUCTION

24

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise well over 10,000 individual

25

chemicals that are used in countless commercial, industrial, and consumer products.1,2 While the

26

composition and properties of their head groups vary greatly with their respective type of

27

application, the functional group common to all PFAS is a perfluoroalkyl tail.3 This remarkably

28

unreactive functional group is the root of PFAS’ high persistence both in the environment and in

29

traditional water, soil, and waste treatment technologies.4

30

Thermal destruction is among the few treatment processes that can break the strong carbon-

31

fluorine bond and completely mineralize PFAS.5 However, as the scientific community’s

32

understanding of high-temperature fluorocarbon chemistry is still evolving, concerns about stack

33

emissions of potentially toxic products of incomplete destruction (PIDs) persist.6 This lack of

34

understanding has led to great uncertainty within the regulatory community, and as a consequence

35

to widely varying regulations internationally to the point of temporary prohibition of incineration

36

of PFAS-containing materials in the U.S.7,8

37

Adding to the uncertainties around thermal PFAS destruction are observations that, at first

38

glance, may seem contradictory. For instance, Xiao and co-workers (2020)9 found that

39

perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) needed a higher decomposition temperature than

40

perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) during treatment of spent granular activated carbon

41

(GAC). In contrast, Shields et al. (2023)10 reported higher destruction efficiencies for PFSAs

42

compared to PFCAs during the incineration of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) in a pilot-scale

43

research combustor. Likely reasons for these discrepancies are (1) surface catalytic processes that

44

are highly material-specific and fundamentally different from gas phase processes as well as (2)

45

concurrent volatilization processes that are captured as mass loss during thermogravimetric

46

analysis but do not necessarily reflect partial or complete destruction of the analytes.6 Furthermore,

47

both Shields et al. (2023)10 and Mattila et al. (2024)11 observed a decrease in PFCA destruction

48

efficiency with decreasing fluorocarbon chain length, while we witnessed only little chain length

49

dependence in PFCA head group loss in a previous computational study.12 A possible explanation

50

for this disagreement between physical and theoretical experiments could be the generation of

51

shorter-chained PFCAs and therefore an apparent decrease in their destruction efficiency during

52

concurrent thermal destruction of longer-chained PFAS. Clearly, more mechanistic insights are

53

needed to unravel the underlying processes and kinetics in complex mixtures.

54

To systematically start identifying and characterizing the highly complex field of thermal

55

PFAS destruction, our study is aimed at elucidating the fundamental steps in the gas phase.

56

Gaseous transformation pathways, mechanisms, and kinetics are not only relevant for assessing

57

PFAS fate in incinerators and thermal oxidizers, but likely also for other thermal processes such

58

as GAC reactivation and pyrolysis of impacted biosolids, where PFAS decomposition may be

59

initiated on a potentially catalytically active surface, but where highly volatile fluorocarbon

60

intermediates may only be mineralized after desorption into the gas phase.13,14 To exclude any

61

surface reaction bias from physical experiments and to overcome the lack of analytical methods

62

capable of detecting often short-lived key intermediates in the thermal decomposition of PFAS,

63

we applied highly accurate quantum chemical calculations using coupled cluster with single and

64

double and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)), which we previously benchmarked against

65

data from physical experiments to confirm that our predictions can achieve chemical accuracy (±1

66

kcal/mol).12 While CCSD(T) calculations are computationally expensive, their use in the

67

investigation of fluorine chemicals is justified because less costly density functional theory (DFT)

68

methods struggle with accurately describing non-covalent interactions, excited states, and kinetic

69

descriptors such as activation barriers.15 Accurate quantification of activation barriers is especially

70

important in high-temperature systems where homolytic bond cleavage proceeds through a

71

variational transition state and, in contrast to ambient temperature, cannot be kinetically described

72

by a bond dissociation (free) energy.12,16-18

73

The first specific objective of our study was to determine the head group dependence on

74

thermal PFAS destruction. Head group loss is thought to be the first step in high-temperature

75

decomposition of PFAS and therefore determines a parent compound’s destruction efficiency, a

76

descriptor widely used to benchmark the effectiveness of incineration processes.10,19,20 Thus far,

77

mechanistic studies have exclusively focused on head group loss in PFCAs and PFSAs.12,18,21-23

78

Some of these studies disagree over the primary decomposition mechanism, partly because of the

79

disregard of variational transition states. Here, we aim to settle these disagreements and expand

80

our mechanistic understanding to a broader set of PFAS head groups that have not been

81

investigated yet, such as sulfonamides, telomers, and alcohols. However, as destruction efficiency

82

does not necessarily relate to complete mineralization of an organic chemical,6 the second specific

83

objective of our study was to identify the kinetic bottleneck for thermal PFAS mineralization in

84

the gas phase. Collectively, we envision these results to provide a framework for safe and efficient

85

thermal destruction of these highly persistent environmental contaminants.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

88

All gas-phase computations were performed on uncharged (acid) species. As previously

89

described,12 reported ground and transition state geometry optimizations as well as vibrational

90

frequency computations used the 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set,24 the ωB97X-D hybrid functional,25

91

an unrestricted formalism for radical species, and the Gaussian 16 electronic structure package.26

92

Single point computations were carried out at stationary points using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set27,28

93

and the DLPNO-CCSD(T) coupled cluster approach29,30 in the ORCA suite of programs.31 The

94

aug-cc-pVTZ basis for sulfur-containing compounds was augmented with a tight d exponent of

95

3.203.32 Estimates of variational transition state free energies of activation Δ‡G were obtained

96

along constrained bond dissociation curves.17 The maximum Δ‡G required to achieve 99%

97

destruction in 2 seconds of combustion gas residence time (t99) curve was obtained along

98

constrained bond dissociation curves to calculate T99 temperatures, a common laboratory

99

benchmark indicative of 99.99% destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) at full scale.19 To

100

describe representative incineration conditions, partial pressures for incineration accrued from

101

estimated initial partial pressures for O2, H2O, and methane of 18.3% and 8.5%, and 4.25%,

102

respectively. These initial concentrations were used in Cantera33 to provide temperature-dependent

103

equilibrium concentrations and associated free energy corrections for bimolecular reactions with

104

second-order kinetics (Fig. S1, Tables S1-S3). Additional details are provided in the Supporting

105

Information.

106
107

As 1 kcal/mol is roughly equivalent to 17 °C within the range of incineration temperatures,
we estimate that the error of our T99 temperatures is within ±20 °C.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

110

Unimolecular Head Group Loss. Initial PFAS head group loss can proceed via unimolecular or

111

bimolecular reactions. Unimolecular mechanisms include hydrogen fluoride (HF) elimination and

112

homolytic bond dissociation.6,34 Starting with carboxylic acids, Fig. 1 shows that HF elimination

113

at the α-carbon (“α-elimination”) requires the lowest temperature among these mechanisms in

114

perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), meaning it is the kinetically

115

most favorable unimolecular decomposition pathway for these two PFCAs consistent with

116

previous studies.12,18 In PFBA, cleavage of the β C-C bond is favored over cleavage of the α and

117

γ C-C bonds (Figure 1b, Table S4), in agreement with bond dissociation energy estimates by

118

Alinezhad and co-workers.35 The free energy barrier Δ‡G for HF elimination is almost independent

119

of temperature as there is very little entropy change in the rearrangement, while the barrier for

120

homolytic C-C cleavage decreases notably with increasing temperature due to transitional entropy

121

build-up. The computed T99 of 700 °C for PFOA based on the preferred mechanism α-elimination

122

agrees well with the equivalent temperature of 680 °C from physical experiments by Weber and

123

co-workers, who carefully vaporized PFOA before inducing its thermal decomposition.36

124

Branching of the perfluorocarbon chain lowers the required temperatures for all three mechanisms

125

by up to 190 °C for C-C cleavage, although α-elimination remains the kinetically most favorable

126

pathways for branched PFOA (T99 = 650 °C, Table 1). The product of α-elimination during gas-

127

phase PFCA decomposition is an acyl fluoride (R-COF, Table 1).12,18,37 This product distribution

128

may differ in the presence of solid surfaces, where the alkene products from β-elimination have

129

been observed in physical experiments.34,38 The perfluoroalkylether carboxylic acid (PFECA)

130

hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, a.k.a. “GenX”) likewise decomposes via α-

131

elimination in the gas phase at a substantially lower T99 of 480 °C compared to PFCAs.12

139

Recent computational studies have reported α-elimination via sultone formation to be the

140

primary pathway for head group loss in PFSAs.22,23 However, the emergence of variational

141

transition states at elevated temperature has been neglected for PFSAs thus far, and many previous

142

computational studies have been carried out at zero Kelvin.6 Our highly accurate computations,

143

which were carried out over a temperature range of 1 to 2000 Kelvin, reveal that α-elimination is

144

indeed the primary head loss mechanism for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and

145

perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), but only at temperatures below 520 °C and 190 °C,

146

respectively (Fig. 1). Above these temperatures, the relatively weak C-S bond leads to a curve

147

crossing and for the homolytic C-S cleavage path to be preferred. The products of initial C-S bond

148

cleavage in PFSAs are a perfluoroalkyl radical and HSO3, which can reductively or oxidatively

149

form H2SO3 or H2SO4. The T99 values of 610 °C for PFOS and 560 °C for PFBS are lower than

150

for PFOA and PFBA, which is consistent with the weaker C-S bond for PFSAs compared to the

151

C-C bond of PFCAs. Our computational findings are supported by recent physical experiments

152

where the favored product formation pathway is observed to be temperature-dependent.39 It should

153

be noted that, on average, the T99 for C-C cleavage was underestimated by 100 °C using DFT (here

154

wB97xd) compared to highly accurate DLPNO-CCSD(T).

We note that for both PFCAs and PFSAs there is little chain length dependence for the

162

initial head group loss. Therefore, shorter chains of two to four perfluorinated carbons were chosen

163

as representative homologues of the remaining investigated PFAS classes to keep computational

164

expenses affordable.

165

Transitioning from a sulfonic acid to the sulfonamide, here perfluorobutane sulfonamide

166

(FBSA), leads to a profound suppression of the α- and β-elimination pathways, as shown in Fig.

167

S2 in the Supporting Information. The T99 rises from 640 °C for PFSAs to over 1000 °C due to the

168

loss of acidity in the amide functional group. For both FBSA and N-methylperfluorooctane

169

sulfonamidoacetic acid (N-MeFBSAA), C-S cleavage is the kinetically preferred pathway with a

170

T99 of 590 °C, only 30 °C higher than for the C4-PFSA analogue PFBS (Tables 1 and S4). The C-

171

S cleavage pathway leads to the generation of a perfluoroalkyl radical analogous to the chain

172

scission pathway proposed by Xiao and co-workers (2021) based on thermal AFFF decomposition

173

in a muffle furnace.40 The alternate N-S cleavage paths are higher at T99 values of 800 °C and 610

174

°C for FBSA and N-MeFBSAA, respectively, and therefore not favored.

175

In contrast to perfluorinated PFAS, the telomeric C2H4 alkyl moiety adjacent to the head

176

group significantly alters the reaction pathways as evident when comparing PFBA to fluorotelomer

177

carboxylic acids (FTCAs) (Table 1). HH elimination is kinetically much less favorable than HF

178

elimination. For 2:3 FTCA, the α- and β-elimination pathways no longer contribute significantly

179

to decomposition and head group elimination parallels that of aliphatic carboxylic acids as

180

summarized in Figs. S3 and S4.41-43 2:3 FTCA loses its head group through C-C cleavage at a T99

181

values of 880 °C, about 40 °C lower than its non-fluorinated counterpart valeric acid (a.k.a.

182

pentanoic acid).43 3:2 FTCA, however, has a β-fluorine and preferentially undergoes β-elimination

183

at a T99 of 690 °C (Figure S5).

184

In comparison to fluorotelomer carboxylic acids, 2:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (FTS) and

185

2:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide (FTSA) have lower T99 values of 740 °C and 700 °C, respectively,

186

for homolytic cleavage due to a weaker C-S bond. Furthermore, FTSs have a significantly lowered

187

β-elimination barrier relative to FTCAs due to formation of an alkene product and a stabilized

188

S(IV) species (T99 = 710 °C). For 2:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide (FTSA), the β-elimination barrier

189

is lowered due to involvement of a C-H bond (T99 = 650 °C). Consequently, unimolecular

190

decomposition of FTSs and FTSAs will primarily produce an alkene product (Table 1, Fig. S7).

191

Other industrially and commercially relevant fluorotelomers are those with an alcoholic

192

terminal group, here 2:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH). FTOHs are uncharged, volatile PFAS that

193

readily transform into FTCAs and PFCAs in the environment.44 Like FTCAs, α-elimination and

194

bond cleavage pathways are kinetically unfavorable for FTOHs, leading to β-elimination being

195

preferred for unimolecular decomposition (T99 = 770 °C) and the generation of an alkene

196

intermediate (Table 1). Also like FTCAs, FTOHs undergo head group loss at slightly lower

197

temperatures than their non-fluorinated counterparts (Fig. S8).45 Vice versa, the fully fluorinated

198

perfluorobutanol (PFBOH, Fig. S9) loses its head group at a much lower T99 of 470 °C through an

199

α-elimination pathway, stabilized by the formation of a carbonyl functional group in contrast to

200

carbene formation for the acids (Table 1).

201

Radical Abstraction. Reaction of the parent PFAS with radicals such as •OH, H•, or R•, the latter

202

one for instance stemming from the hydrocarbon fuel, is an alternative to unimolecular

203

decomposition. As shown in Fig. S10, F atom abstraction from PFAS is unfavorable under

204

representative incineration conditions12,20 with T99 values ranging between 1060 °C for F atom

205

abstraction by hydrogen and 1710 °C for F atom abstraction by fluorine radicals, which may be

206

present from the thermal decomposition of other PFAS in the treated material. With a T99 range

207

from 640 °C to 770 °C (Fig. 2a), hydrogen atom abstraction from the head group by •OH is

208

kinetically more favorable than by H• (T99 range 730 °C to 850 °C) or •CH3 radicals (T99 range 820

209

°C to 950 °C, Figure S11).

For head group H abstraction, there is a clear trend that telomeric polyfluoroalkyl

220

substances require lower temperatures than their perfluorinated homologues. The resulting head

221

group radical species are highly unstable and rapidly eliminate CO2, SO3, SO2NH, or CF2O,

222

generating perfluorocarbon radicals with T99 values below room temperature (Fig. S12).

223

However, for all five telomer classes investigated here, H abstraction from the telomeric

224

C2H4 moiety requires T99 temperatures 30 to 100 °C lower than H abstraction from the respective

225

head group (Fig. 2b). For 2:2 FTS, H abstraction from the β-carbon is most favorable, while for

226

the four other species, H abstraction from the α-carbon is most favorable. In fact, when comparing

227

free energies of activation with unimolecular head loss mechanisms, H abstraction from the

228

telomeric C2H4 by •OH under incineration conditions is the most favorable decomposition

229

mechanism for all five investigated fluorotelomers 2:2 FTS (T99 = 650 °C), 2:2 FTSA (T99 = 630

230

°C), 2:2 FTOH (T99 = 580 °C), 3:2 FTCA (T99 = 660 °C), and 2:3 FTCA (T99 = 630 °C). Subsequent

231

radical decomposition occurs below 270 °C generating the head group radical and a telomeric

232

alkene (Fig. S13).

233

It is important to note that •OH concentrations are substantially lower under oxygen-

234

depleted conditions, which can exist in poorly mixed incinerators.20 This may lead to an increase

235

in free energies of activation for H abstraction by •OH of 20 kcal/mol (Fig. S1), and consequently

236

to a shift in primary degradation mechanism for fluorotelomers towards other H-abstracting

237

radicals or, as a kinetically worst-case scenario, to the respective primary unimolecular

238

decomposition mechanisms summarized in Table 2.

239

Fate of the Head Group Loss Products. Once the headgroup has been removed from PFAS, the

240

resulting perfluoroalkyl radicals, acyl fluorides or alkenes can react with abundant gas-phase

241

species such as H2O, O2, hydrogen, or hydrocarbon fuel. Alkenes react with H•, •OH, and O2 at T99

242

temperatures ranging from 610 °C to 740 °C (Fig. S14). Acyl fluorides do not hydrolyze in the gas

243

phase even in the presence of water vapor, but C-C cleavage reactions occur between 830-880 °C

244

and OH addition proceeds between 820-920 °C (Fig. S15 and additional computations below).

245

Perfluoroalkyl radicals can follow several decomposition pathways.36,46 Decomposition

246

can form shorter chain perfluoroalkyl radicals and a difluoro carbene CF2 (pathway a in Fig. 3a,

247

T99 = 430 °C) or tetrafluoroethene C2F4 (b, T99 = 560 °C). In contrast, for telomeric fluoroalkyl

248

radicals, ethylene loss (T99 = 290 °C) is substantially more kinetically favorable than methylene

249

loss (T99 = 1080 °C, Fig. S16). Alternatively, the primary radical can lose fluorine, generating an

250

alkene (d, T99 = 570 °C). However, H abstraction is the most favorable mechanism for

251

perfluoroalkyl radicals. In an incinerator with significant hydrocarbon fuel and water vapor, H

252

abstraction from H2O and H2 proceeds at T99 temperatures of 280 °C (f) and 150 °C (l),

253

respectively, while a very low T99 of 100 °C implies that the hydrocarbon fuel (here: CH4) is the

254

primary source for perfluoroalkyl radical transformation, forming 1H-perfluoroalkanes (e).

255

Isomerization of primary perfluoroalkyl radicals to more stable secondary radicals only

256

proceeds with a higher T99 of 380 °C (c). Secondary radicals may undergo the same reactions as

257

primary radicals, though generally at higher temperatures (Figure 3b). Again, the most favorable

258

pathway is H abstraction from the hydrocarbon fuel (j) at a T99 of 280 °C.

259

Alternatively, as outlined in Fig. S17 under incineration conditions, perfluoroalkyl radicals

260

can also react with O2 forming peroxy radicals with a T99 of -10 °C but require 520 °C to

261

decompose further. Reverse reaction of the peroxy radicals to perfluoroalkyl radicals is kinetically

262

more favorable than (forward) decomposition with a T99 of 280 °C. Parallel to hydrocarbon

263

combustion,35,47 polyfluoroalkyl radicals also react with O2 at low temperature and rearrange to

264

hydroperoxyalkyl radical species (•QOOH) at 270 °C and decompose to an alkene plus peroxy

265

radical at 40 °C (Fig. S17).

Figure 3. Thermal transformation pathways for (a) primary and (b) secondary

268

perfluoroalkyl radicals, both boxed in blue. Perfluoroalkyl radicals are central products of

269

head group loss or carbon chain cleavage of larger fluoroalkanes (black box). Temperatures

270

provided are T99 values. The red T99 and red box indicate the kinetically most favorable

271

pathway for perfluoroalkyl radicals.

272

Consequently, various pathways exist for the products of heads group loss with T99

273

temperatures substantially below the temperatures computed for head group removal (Table 1).

274

These products are therefore not the kinetic bottleneck on the path to complete thermal

275

mineralization.

276

Carbon-Carbon Cleavage in Fluoroalkanes. While 1H-perfluoroalkanes are the predicted major

277

products from perfluoroalkyl radical transformation in treatment systems with excess hydrocarbon

278

fuel, non-hydrogenated perfluoroalkanes may be generated from F trapping/abstraction or

279

recombination of perfluoroalkyl radicals. These fluoroalkanes are thought to decompose via C-C

280

bond dissociation46,48 because homolytic cleavage of the carbon-fluorine bond has a substantially

281

higher activation barrier. This is the reason for CF4 having an exceptionally high T99 of 1450 °C.12

282

Free energies of activation as a function of temperature for C-C bond cleavage in a series

283

of perfluoroalkanes is shown in Fig. 4a. Both experimental and computational data reveal a general

284

chain length-dependence as required thermal decomposition temperatures increase with

285

decreasing perfluoroalkane size. For the synthetic fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),

286

a T99 of only 580 °C has been reported.49,50 The required thermal destruction temperatures then

287

increase notably to T99 of 800 °C for perfluorooctane, 840 °C for perfluorohexane, and 890 °C for

288

perfluorobutane, until they reach a computationally predicted T99 for C2F6 of 920 °C, close to the

289

experimentally reported ones of 912 °C,5 919 °C,51 and 940 °C.52

cleavage in a series of a) perfluoroalkanes and b) butane with varying degrees of fluorination.

The black line illustrates the maximum free energy of activation required to achieve 99%

294

destruction in 2 seconds of combustion gas residence time (t99). The temperatures at the

295

crossing points of the respective lowest free energy of activation and the black line represent

296

T99.

297

The effect of substituting hydrogen for fluorine on C-C bond cleavage T99 temperatures

298

can be seen in the example of C4 alkanes in Fig. 4b. 1H-perfluorobutane’s T99 is 880 °C, within

299

the margin of estimation error to perfluorobutane’s T99 of 890 °C. 2H-perfluorobutane’s T99 is

300

slightly higher at 920 °C, while an alkyl-perfluoroalkyl linkage further raises the temperature to

301

940 °C for 1H,1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorobutane. For fully hydrogenated (non-fluorinated) butane,

302

the T99 drops to 860 °C. Fluorinated C-C bonds are stronger than the hydrogen analog while the

303

polarity of the heteropolar C-C bond of C2H5-C2F5 strengthens the bond further.

304

Given these high T99 temperatures, the cleavage of 1H-perfluoroalkanes and, if present,

305

perfluoroalkanes can be identified as the kinetic bottlenecks in the thermal gas-phase

306

decomposition of PFAS. Indeed, 1H-perfluoroalkanes were observed to be the dominant products

307

of incomplete thermal PFAS destruction in a recent pilot-scale AFFF decomposition study.10 Fully

308

fluorinated perfluoroalkanes were detected as minor products in the same pilot-scale study10 as

309

well as in a small-scale AFFF pyrolysis study.53 The radical products of fluoroalkane C-C cleavage

310

then undergo the reactions discussed above (Fig. 3a).

311

Kinetic Modeling. As multiple potential parallel pathways exist, product distributions based on

312

predicted thermochemical parameters can be estimated using kinetic modeling.18,54 The important

313

question is at what temperature does complete mineralization occur and by which pathway. In Fig.

314

5 we compare two pathways for PFOA decomposition, a sequential carboxylic acid pathway and

315

a C-C bond cleavage pathway. PFOA was chosen as model species because among all PFAS

316

investigated in this study, PFCAs require the highest gas-phase decomposition temperatures and

317

can thus be seen as a worst-case scenario.

Figure 5. Comparison of (a) a sequential carboxylic acid pathway with (b) a C-C bond

320

cleavage pathway for gas-phase PFOA decomposition as a function of temperature. The

321

kinetically limiting steps for the carboxylic acid path are α-HF elimination (blue box) and

322

•OH addition to the acyl fluoride intermediates (green box). For the bond cleavage path, the

323

kinetically limiting steps are homolytic cleavage of various bonds in the carbon chain of the

324

initially formed perfluoroheptanoyl fluoride (PFHpCOF, green box) and cleavage of the 1H-

325

perfluoroalkane intermediates (blue box).

326

As discussed above, PFOA initially decomposes via α-elimination to form a lactone

327

intermediate (Fig. 1), which rapidly decarbonylates into perfluoroheptanoyl fluoride (PFHpCOF,

328

Fig. 5a). In the sequential carboxylic acid pathway, subsequent PFHpCOF decomposition proceeds

329

by way of •OH addition forming perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA). This pathway then repeats to

330

generate acyl fluoride intermediates (R-COF) and PFCAs of increasingly shorter chain length. The

331

kinetic bottleneck in this pathway is the decomposition of the acyl fluoride species (T99 of 830-

332

880 °C versus T99 of 700 °C for α-elimination) as can be seen by the dominance of acyl fluorides

333

in the product distribution (Fig. 5a). Within the simulated temperature range of 810-970 °C, chosen

334

based on the pilot-scale study by Shields and colleagues,10 and at a hydroxyl radical concentration

335

representative of incineration conditions (3x10-6 atm), a significant fraction of PFAS remains up

336

to 920 °C, and only at 970 °C 97% of PFOA are completely destroyed via this pathway considering

337

a 2-second residence time.

338

In the C-C bond cleavage pathway (Fig. 5b), which is a unimolecular pathway independent

339

of any secondary species’ concentration, the initially formed PFHpCOF undergoes chain rupture

340

in various places. This process generates C1-C5 perfluoroalkyl radicals, which then abstract

341

hydrogen to generate 1H-perfluororadicals in a repeating cycle that does not produce sequentially

342

shorter PFCAs. This pathway is kinetically preferred over the sequential carboxylic acid pathway:

343

at 920 °C only 0.3% of PFAS remains, and at 970 °C only 10-11% of PFAS remains after 2 seconds.

344

We note that both pathways ultimately lead to the generation of carbonyl fluoride COF2 (Fig. 5),

345

which rapidly decomposes in aqueous media (T99 of 20 °C).

346

Implications. Our highly accurate coupled cluster calculations reveal that in the gas phase, i.e., in

347

the absence of heterogeneous catalysis on reactor, waste, ash or other surfaces, six out of eleven

348

PFAS classes investigated in this study undergo initial unimolecular head group loss, which

349

includes all perfluoroalkyl acids such as PFCAs and PFSAs. For all five fluorotelomers, however,

350

initial H abstraction from the telomeric functional group by hydroxyl radicals is more favorable

351

under incineration (combustion) conditions, which is then followed by rapid radical

352

decomposition. However, it is important to reiterate that changes in concentrations of radicals and

353

other reactive species in the gas phase may lead to changes in primary reaction mechanisms,

354

pathways, and kinetics. Therefore, even in the gas phase in the absence of catalytic processes, the

355

outcomes of thermal PFAS destruction can be expected to be specific to process conditions.

356

The major intermediates from thermal PFAS destruction are 1H-perfluoroalkanes,10 which

357

are formed when perfluoroalkyl radicals abstract hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuel and to a lesser

358

extent from water. Two implications of these findings are (1) that DREs calculated based on parent

359

PFAS removal are of little value and (2) that especially short-chain 1H-perfluoroalkanes are

360

suitable benchmark chemicals to assess whether a particular thermal process, reactor or facility is

361

capable of complete PFAS destruction.

362

Several previous bench-scale studies have reported thermal decomposition of parent PFAS

363

at temperatures hundreds of °C below the ones reported in this study.9,38,40,54 Such observations

364

are possible due to surface catalysis and other effects, but often do not capture the fate of volatile

23

365

PIDs generated. Fluorine mass balance closure is therefore not achieved, which is critical for the

366

assessment of destructive PFAS technologies55 and should be the aim of future studies. It seems

367

prudent to ensure that a particular thermal process can sufficiently destroy 1H-perfluoroalkanes

368

within 2 seconds of gas residence time. Our kinetic calculations reveal that ≥99.99% destruction

369

and removal of C8 and shorter PFAS at the full scale are possible at temperatures around 950 °C.

370

In fact, hazardous waste incinerators typically operate at much higher temperatures around 1100

371

°C and commonly treat organic chemicals that require much higher temperatures than PFAS, such

372

as chlorobenzene (T99 = 990 °C), acetonitrile (T99 = 1000 °C), and naphthalene (T99 = 1070 °C).20

373

It remains to be noted that safe and complete thermal PFAS destruction is a more complex

374

engineering problem than dialing in a temperature of ~950 °C at ≥2 seconds gas residence time.

375

One important factor is to optimize mixing in the reactor to ensure sufficient exposure to high

376

temperatures and to minimize pockets of depleted oxygen and other relevant reactants. Other

377

critical variables are waste stream composition, fuel:oxygen:PFAS ratio, and the presence of

378

fluorine scavenger(s), which are all related to the fact that many relevant reactions are bimolecular

379

with second-order kinetics, and therefore concentration-dependent. For instance, a very limited

380

number of experimental studies38,56 have reported the generation of tetrafluoromethane, a potent

381

greenhouse gas, through recombination of CF3 with fluorine. As discussed above, CF4 destruction

382

requires extremely high temperatures >1400 °C because high-barrier C-F bond dissociation is the

383

only decomposition mechanism. Preventing tetrafluoromethane formation should thus be a main

384

priority during process development and optimization, and can be achieved by (1) providing

385

sufficient hydrogen donors such as hydrocarbons and water, (2) lowering PFAS and thus F

386

concentrations in the feed, and/or (3) adding fluorine scavengers such as lime to the feed. These

387

best practices are imperative for safe thermal destruction of PFAS.
