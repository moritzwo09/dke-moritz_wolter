Abstract
Municipal wastewater facilities can contain recycle streams with high nutrient content, that both
increase the overall energy consumption in the facility and cause environmental pollution when
not properly handled. Reducing the nutrient load of these streams through recovery is a
promising solution that enhances the Food-Energy-Water nexus by producing sustainable
fertilizer. In this study, the potential for nutrient recovery at municipal wastewater facilities was
investigated through a 1-year sampling of nutrient, ionic, organic and heavy metal composition
of three wastewater streams influent to or effluent from two types of digesters. Subsequently,
electrochemical nutrient recovery was evaluated for these streams through multivariate screening
of three groups of variables – operational, stream and design – and the effect of these variables
on optimal nutrient recovery in the form of phosphorus. Results showed that Orthophosphate
(Ortho-P) and ammonia concentrations do not show significant correlation in any tested streams.
On the other hand, major ions exhibited interdependence with Ortho-P concentration, while the
stream pH was found to correlate with Ortho-P and Cl- in the anaerobic digester effluent.
Screening analyses identified 5 – anode type, cathodic potential, initial P concentration, initial
NH4+ concentration and temperature – of the 11 variables evaluated were the variables that most
significantly affected P recovery efficiency and specific energy consumed during this recovery.
Finally, the optimum conditions for high phosphorus recovery and low energy consumption from
the anaerobic digester effluent during a 2-hour experiment were a cathodic potential of -0.805 V
vs Ag/AgClsat, an electrode area to electrolyte volume ratio of 0.145 1/cm, and a temperature of
41.3°C, with a solid product that was predominantly struvite. Overall, the demonstrated 95% P
recovery efficiency and 0.03 kWh/kg P are characteristic of an emerging process that could be
competitive at scale with state-of-the-art synthetic nutrient routes, if applied to the right stream.

Introduction
About 35% of a municipality's total energy expenses can be attributed to the treatment

systems of drinking water and wastewater 1,2. High energy consumption in wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs) usually results from secondary treatment processes such as aeration which
utilizes more than 50% of the total required energy 3,4. This aeration is typically for supplying
oxygen to microorganisms used for nitrification of ammonia (NH3), even though water has
limited capacity to dissolve oxygen (40 mg O2/l vs 1450 mg CO2/l at 25°C) resulting in
increased costs for aeration 4,5. Some treatment plants have integrated sludge digesters to both
reduce the solid organic content handled at the facility, while also generating biogas that could
be used to reduce the overall energy consumed by these facilities. However, this use of sludge
digesters produces a supernatant with high Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (P) content 6. This
supernatant, which is recycled to the primary and secondary processes at WWTPs, increases the
amount of coagulant required for reducing P load and energy consumption by aeration for
reducing N load. Alternatively, the supernatant is used as a direct fertilizer on agricultural lands
in some places, which can enhance nutrient leaching through the soil to water bodies 7,8. This in
turn, results in a surplus of nutrients in the water bodies and excessive algae growth, or
eutrophication 7,9. Therefore, due to energy costs and environmental regulations, it is important
to decrease the nutrient load of the supernatant stream 8,10,11. Additionally, this decreased load
would further enhance the viability of converting wastewater treatment plants to water resource
recovery facilities (WRRF) through the generation of water, re-usable energy and nutrients. In
essence, this combination of wastewater treatment, energy recovery and nutrient availability is
representative of a relevant challenge in the Food-Energy-Water nexus and the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals.

Different physiochemical processes have been used to decrease the nutrient load of the
supernatant, such as NH3 stripping, CO2 stripping and membrane filtration 7,10,12–14. Forward
osmosis is also utilized to concentrate the supernatant to decrease its volume and extract less
polluted water, but this method does not directly remove any nutrient from the stream, thus
forward osmosis needs to be coupled with other operations 15. Nutrients, specifically P, are
currently removed in WWTPs through chemical precipitation, enhanced biological P removal, or
a combination of both. Biological P removal involves either direct absorption of P by
phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAO), or improving the P storage capacity of the
microorganism biomass 10,16. Even though biological treatment offers lower operation costs as
compared to physiochemical processes 7,17, this treatment results in excess sludge with high P
concentrations that need additional treatment steps prior to environmental discharge 10,18. On the
other hand, chemical precipitation through the addition of metal ions such as iron (Fe) and
aluminum (Al) coagulants removes P from wastewater 10,14,19,20, but limits P reusability as
fertilizer due to the insoluble coagulant products 16,21. Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca)-driven
chemical precipitation enable the recovery of P as a reusable product 10,21. However, these
chemical processes rely on pH adjustment through dosing with hydroxides, such as NaOH, and
the costs associated with supplying the chemicals is a major drawback of these chemical P
recovery technologies 22.
Alternatively, solution pH adjustment can be driven through electrochemistry, thereby
facilitating nutrient recovery from municipal wastewater 23. Water reduction (Equation 1) or
oxygen reduction (Equation 2) at the cathode coupled with magnesium oxidation (Equation 3) at
the anode can be used to drive the pH 24, or couple with water oxidation at the anode and
dissolved magnesium salts in a reactor known as an electrolyzer.

This Electrified Nutrient Recovery (ENR) reduces or eliminates chemical addition by
using electricity. Furthermore, ENR creates an additional driving force for ion migration via the
potential gradient between the electrodes, thereby, enhancing the transport conditions for nutrient
recovery20. ENR has been studied using different reactor configurations and wastewater streams.
Lei et al., while performing water reduction to drive pH, investigated the effect of applied
current on P recovery from cheese wastewater and reported a recovery of 90% and energy
consumption of 64.7 kWh/kg of P 25. Belarbi et al. simulated animal waste and evaluated the
effect of temperature, cathodic potential and turbulence on electrochemical P recovery via
oxygen reduction, achieving a maximum recovery of 80% at 0.5 kWh/kg of P 20. A sacrificial
Mg anode was implemented by Kékedy-Nagy to study the effect of water chemistry on P
recovery from poultry and municipal wastewater, obtaining a recovery range of 44.6 - 93% at
756-1181 kWh/kg of P 23. Although these results established the prospect of ENR, integrating
this technology in municipal WWTPs and future WRRFs requires investigating several factors
that affect the efficiency of the system; factors not previously considered in the literature. These

factors include composition of the treated streams, the design and operation of the electrified
process and how these factors significantly influence the type of recovered products and the
energy consumed during this recovery process. This combination of analyses could provide an
enhanced connectivity between the composition of the different wastewaters and the applied
recovery process and provide a foundation for competing with state-of-the-art synthetic
techniques that deliver the same nutrients at an industrial level.
In this study, we show the variability in the nutrient, ionic and heavy metal composition
of post-digester streams based on samples collected over a one-year period and evaluate any time
dependence of and correlation between the components assessed. This sampling assessment is
key for identifying streams with potential value for nutrient recovery and may also provide
additional descriptors for stream compositions based on correlated components. A recent review
has quantified the general composition of different post-digester waste streams at various
facilities in Europe 6. However, prior to this review, this compositional information for recycle
streams – typically called side streams – was unavailable in literature and the data in the review
does not describe any time series effect. Next, we conducted a multivariate screening analysis of
eleven variables associated with the stream chemistry, electrolyzer design and electrolyzer
operation to characterize the factors that have the most significant impact on well-defined
engineering figures of merit. This screening assessment could be indicative of the controls
available for efficient deployment of this emerging approach, especially considering the
variability in WWTP operations. Finally, we propose variables needed for optimal nutrient
recovery by the electrolyzer using water from one of the sampled streams. Overall, this study
represents a holistic and realistic investigation into integrating electrochemical nutrient recovery
with a municipal wastewater treatment (and future recovery) facility and demonstrates the key

state-of-the-art and synthetic routes.

Methodology

2.1

Wastewater Sampling and Characterization
Wastewater was collected approximately semi-monthly for one year (November 2021 to

October 2022) from two different WWTPs in Ohio, U.S.A.: the 100 million gallons per day
(MGD) Southerly WWTP in Columbus and the 4 MGD WWTP in Athens. At the Southerly
WWTP, a plant with an anaerobic digester as illustrated in Figure S1, samples were collected
from streams that make up the centrate stream of the facility: liquid from the post-digester
dewatering centrifuge and liquid from the pre-digester thickening centrifuge. At the Athens
WWTP, a plant with an aerobic digester, samples were collected from a post-digester settling
tank. The sampled wastewater was analyzed for physical characteristics, chemical properties and
species composition by MASI Environmental Laboratories, Plain City, Ohio. The methods used
for each test can be found in Table S1. The pH and conductivity of each sample was also
measured on the field (i.e., at the point of collection) using an ultra-meter (Myron L company) to
cross-validate with the result from MASI Lab.
2.2

Time Series Analyses
The year-long municipal wastewater sampling results were used to investigate time-

dependent trends and correlations between species within the three sampled streams. To
determine the stationarity of each data series, for each species and stream combination, a DickeyFuller test was performed 26. Next, correlations, cross-correlations, and regressions were
performed between species to evaluate relationships between major nutrient concentrations

(ortho-phosphate, total phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate/nitrite), competing ions (Ca and Mg),
heavy metals (specifically Zn2+), and the effect of stream pH on major nutrients and chloride
compositions. The correlations, cross-correlations, and regressions were completed to assess the
degree of association between species and the presence of any dynamics between species
(whether past levels of one is associated with present levels of another) using standard time
series analysis techniques 27. A relationship between species within a stream was determined to
be significant only if each coefficient in the regression model passed a t-test, the model residuals
were stationary, and the equation yielded an R-squared or adjusted R-squared of >0.90.
2.3

Chemicals and Reactor Configuration
All electrochemical experiments in the screening analysis were conducted using synthetic

wastewater which simplifies the test by eliminating the complexities associated with real
wastewater, such as biological contaminants, emerging pollutants, and heavy metals. The
wastewater was synthesized based on the composition from the one-year sampling period and the
design of experiment outlined in Table S2. 1M stock solutions of twelve salts: ammonium
formate NH4COOH (Certified Crystalline 97 – 103%, Fisher Chemical), ammonium chloride
NH4Cl (ACS reagent 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4 (Primary Standard
20.98 – 21.38%, Fisher Chemical), ammonium nitrate NH4NO3 (Certified ACS 98%, Fisher
Chemical), sodium formate NaCOOH (ACS reagent 98%, Thermo Scientific), sodium chloride
NaCl (Analytical 99.5%, Thermo Scientific), disodium sulfate decahydrate Na2SO4.10H2O
(Analytical 99%, Thermo Scientific), sodium nitrate NaNO3 (ACS reagent 98%, 98%, Thermo
Scientific), magnesium chloride hexahydrate MgCl2.6H2O (ACS reagent 99 – 102%, SigmaAldrich), calcium chloride CaCl2 (ACS reagent 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium phosphate

monobasic monohydrate NaH2PO4.H2O (Analytical 99+%, Acros Organics), and potassium
phosphate dibasic K2HPO4 (ACS reagent 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), were prepared. The volume
from each stock solution required to achieve the desired concentration of ions in the synthetic
wastewater were determined using matrix algebra and 750 ml total of synthetic solution was
prepared for each experimental run. The pH of each solution was adjusted to 6.25 for all runs
using 0.4 M sodium hydroxide, NaOH (ACS grade, Pfaltz & Baner) solution to maintain the
same initial pH for all screening experiments.
All experiments in the optimization analysis were conducted using real wastewater
collected from Southerly Columbus WWTP anaerobic digester due to its high nutrient strength.
Vacuum filtration was used to separate the suspended solids in the wastewater before the
experiments.
All experiments – screening and optimization – were conducted using a bench-scale
electrochemical reactor, as shown in Figure 1, operated in a batch mode. The reactor comprises a
1-liter jacketed glass vessel (Pine Research AFCELL8U3) and a sealed lid with multiple inlets
for electrodes, a Luggin capillary, air sparger, overhead agitator, pH probe, and temperature
sensor. The jacket enabled a controlled temperature experiment through the circulation of a
cooling or heating fluid from a water circulator (Julabo DYNEO DD-200F) coupled with a
temperature sensor for feedback from the reactor liquid to the circulator set point. The air sparger
was connected to a zero-air gas cylinder equipped with a flow meter for continual supply of
dissolved oxygen, a pH sensor (OaktonTM pH electrode) was used to monitor the bulk solution
throughout the experiment, and a speed rotator was used to control fluid agitation during
experiments. A three-electrode design was utilized, consisting of either 316 or 304 stainless steel

(12″ × 36″ × 0.048″, McMaster-Carr) as the cathode, a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode,
and graphite (12″ × 24″ × 0.06255″, Grainger) or AZ31 magnesium alloy foil as the anode (200
mm × 500 mm × 1 mm, Goodfellow). The stainless steel (SS) electrode was polished with
silicon carbide sandpaper (600 grit) to remove any surface contaminants. Following the
mechanical polishing procedure, the SS electrode was sonicated in deionized water for ten
minutes to remove any remaining debris on the surface and subsequently air-dried before being
used.
Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the electrochemical reactor.

Chronoamperometric measurements – constant electrode potential, with current measured
– was used to facilitate phosphate deposition by a pH increase at the cathode through water or
oxygen reduction (Equations 1 and 2) depending on the potential. The cathodic potential was
controlled using an Interface 5000E potentiostat (Gamry Instrument). The Luggin capillary
(filled with 4M KCl) was used to position the reference electrode near the cathode to minimize
ohmic resistance between the cathode and reference electrode. The anode either closes the

electrical circuit and contributes magnesium ions for nutrient recovery (equation 3) or closes the
electrical circuit and does not contribute to the recovery process (equation 4). A data acquisition
device (USB-1808, Measurement computing) was used to measure the overall cell voltage –
potential difference between the cathode and anode – of the electrochemical system. The
exposed surface area of the electrodes and the electrode type varied depending on the
experimental design.

Design of Experiments and Reactor Operation

2.4.1 Screening Analyses
The eleven variables in this study, categorized into three main groups of operational,
stream and design, are presented in Table 1.

These 11 variables were selected based on factors known to impact chemical nutrient
recovery and electrochemical systems design and the variability captured from the wastewater
sampling in this study. The aim of these experiments was to characterize the most influential
variables affecting phosphorus recovery efficiency and specific energy consumption before
attempting any process optimization. A Plackett-Burman (PB) design was chosen, which
provides a first-order formulation of the system and offers the lowest number of experiments
which is important when a high number of factors have been considered 28,29. Minitab® version

21.1.0 was used to develop the PB design with ten variables at two levels each (shown in Table
2) in two blocks that accounted for the variable associated with cathode type. This design
resulted in twelve distinct experimental runs, with three replicates each, in each block. The
complete list of these 12 distinct experiments is provided in Table S2. The high and low levels of
the stream variables were determined based on the wastewater sampling data. The operating
range for the electrochemical setup was based on the prior experiments conducted in the research
group 20.
Once the experiments were setup with electrodes and electrolyte in the reactor, the
electrolyte was sparged with air for 30 minutes before starting the chronoamperometry
experiment to saturate the solution with dissolved oxygen. Additionally, air sparging continued
throughout the 6-hour experiments to sustain the dissolved oxygen level. During each
experiment, 3 mL liquid samples were collected from the reactor every 30 minutes and analyzed
for phosphorus content.

direction of the change in the mean value of the response when each factor is individually
altered, and derived coefficient variability represented by its standard deviation (SD) 30. Factors
with a P-value lower than the significance level (𝛼) of 0.05 were important variables and the tvalue, calculated as the ratio of the coefficient to its SD is illustrated in a descending order as a
Pareto chart of standardized effects 29–31. This chart establishes the order of the variable
significance, with those exceeding the reference line considered as the key factors 32. The linear
regression models were also characterized by the R-squared value, with higher values indicating
a better model accuracy. Additionally, normal probability plot of residuals assessing the
goodness of fit for the proposed models were also acquired, which should have a linear trend to
verify the normal distribution of residuals 33. Finally, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with a
bandwidth of 0.1 was used to compare the performance of SS316 and SS304 in each experiment
block in terms of both responses. A KDE distribution visualizes the data spread and the
abundance of each value compared to the other values in the population 34, and in this study, the
performance of the two SS types in terms of the overall performance and data spread tendency
were compared using this type of plot.

2.4.2 Optimization Analysis
The optimization analysis was conducted to determine the optimal operating conditions for
ENR based on three down-selected variables from the screening analysis with more test points
added for these three variables. The circumscribed version of a Box-Wilson central composite
design (CCD) was selected, comprising 8 corner points, 6 axial points, and 6 center points with
two replicates each. CCD is a common response surface method for second-order modeling,
mainly due to the efficient number of experimental runs required 29 and its ability to explore
14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gwpw5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6737-415X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

extreme input variable values through the axial points. The second-order model captures the
curvature in the response (i.e., the interaction between variables and quadratic effects), and was
used in combination with the response optimizer in Minitab to quantify the conditions that
maximize percentage phosphorus recovery and minimize specific energy consumption. The
actual factors and levels of the experimental design are presented in Table S3 while a full list of
the distinct experimental runs is shown in Table S4. The center point is the midpoint value
between the high and low values from the screening analysis, the corner points are the refined
high and low values for this analysis, while the axial points are the extreme high and low values
calculated from the center point using an axial spacing of 1.633. The reactor operation was
similar to the screening analysis; however, the chronoamperometry experiments were conducted
over 2 hours, as the recovery from the real wastewater samples occurred more quickly.
Additionally, 3 mL liquid samples were collected periodically and analyzed for phosphorus
content.
2.5

Material Characterization

2.5.1 Liquid Characterization
All liquid samples were analyzed for phosphorus concentration with an Inductively
Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, iCAP 6000 Series, Thermo
Scientific, USA) at a wavelength of 185.891 in axial mode. The ICP-OES is an analytical
technique that relies on ions’ ability to be excited and emit electromagnetic radiation at a
wavelength specific to an element 35. The instrument was calibrated using a standard solution
with concentrations within the range of the expected levels in the wastewater samples. For
sample preparation, the liquid was centrifuged to remove any precipitated solids that could clog
the tubes transporting the fluid in and out of the instrument. The clarified samples were then

diluted tenfold with deionized water in a 10 ml (±0.08) volumetric flask to prepare them for
analysis.
2.5.2 Solid Characterization
After each experiment, the electrodes were air-dried for 24 hours, while the precipitates
from the bulk solution were filtered, air-dried, and stored under ambient conditions. Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM 6010PLUS/LA) was used to examine the morphology of
the solids, while X-ray Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) coupled with the SEM with an
accelerating voltage of 15 kV and working distance (WD) of 11 mm, was used to determine the
elemental composition and particle size measurements were performed using ImageJ software 36.
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, Rigaku miniflex 600) was used for phase identification and
composition of the solids using Cu-Kα radiation (1.54059 Å), a 2θ range of 10-90 degrees, a
speed of 2.5 deg/min, a step angle of 0.02°, a current of 15 mA and a voltage of 30 kV. The
refinement of the collected diffractograms were performed via GSAS-II program 37, using the
Rietveld method 38. Crystallographic texture, instrument parameters, sample displacement, phase
fractions, lattice parameters and background signal are parameters that were refined from the raw
data. A data residual value (Rw), indicating the difference between the raw and refined
diffractograms of the sample 39 is calculated at the end of each refinement and an Rw value in or
close to the range of 5-10 % is considered a good agreement.

Aerobic digesters, typical of smaller WWTPs such as Athens, Ohio WWTP, use
microorganisms in waste-activated sludge (WAS) to break down organic matter in the presence
of oxygen. These microorganisms consume phosphorus for their growth and retain it in the
biosolids, resulting in a lower P content in the effluent 10,41. In contrast, the anaerobic digesters in
larger treatment plants usually produce effluent with high nutrient content. These digesters use
methane-producing bacteria, which require less nutrients for their growth, to break down the
sludge’s organic content in an oxygen-free environment 41. Additionally, in WWTPs with an
enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) step such as the Southerly Columbus plant,
anaerobic digestion releases phosphorus accumulated in the feed sludge by phosphorusaccumulating organisms (PAOs) in the EBPR process41, further increasing the P concentration in
the supernatant. Before anaerobic digestion, thickening centrifuges are used to reduce the liquid
volume of WAS to be fed to the digester. Therefore, the effluent from this process is expected to
have lower P concentration.
The phosphorus concentration in the aerobic effluent sample collected from Athens Ohio
WWTP ranges from 6 to 63 mg/L, correlating with aerobic filtrate characteristics observed in
some WWTPs in North Florida as reported by Hallas et al. 42. The total P content in the
anaerobic effluent from Southerly Columbus Ohio WWTP ranges from 126-346 mg/L,
consistent with the average concentration reported by Lee et al. and Wang et al. 43,44. Also, the
phosphorus concentration in the thickening effluent, falls below the upper limit of 60 mg/L
reported by Metcalf et al. 41, ranging between 1.32 - 34.24 mg/L. This slight variation from the
upper limit might be due to lower P content in the plant's influent stream or the efficiency of P
removal treatment before centrifuge thickening.

3.1.2 Concentration of Ammonia-Nitrogen, Nitrate-Nitrite
Nitrogenous compounds in wastewater treatment plants are usually found as free
ammonia (NH3 and its ionized form, ammonium 𝑁𝐻4+ ), nitrate (𝑁𝑂3− ), nitrite (𝑁𝑂2− ), and organic
nitrogen 45. Figures 2b and 2c illustrate the concentration of free ammonia and nitrate-nitrite,
respectively, across the three wastewater samples. Typically, nearly all free ammonia exists as
ammonium at room temperature and a pH of around 7 46. In the anaerobic effluent sample with
an average pH of 7.16, the free ammonia concentration (Figure 2b) aligns with typical anaerobic
supernatant ammonium levels ranging from 800 to 1300 mg/L, as reported by Metcalf et al. 41.
This suggests that almost all free ammonia in the Columbus anaerobic sample exists as
ammonium, making it less toxic.
In a typical WWTP, ammonium in the mainstream is removed by oxidation to nitrate
through nitrification, facilitated by specific bacteria in the presence of oxygen. Subsequently,
reduction of the nitrate to nitrogen gas occurs through denitrification. However, during anaerobic
sludge treatment, organic nitrogen in the sludge is broken down into ammonium, which does not
nitrify due to lack of oxygen in the digesters. This explains why the anaerobic effluent
ammonium concentration in Figure 2b is notably higher, and the nitrate-nitrite concentration in
Figure 2c is comparatively lower than in the aerobic effluent. The ammonium and nitrate-nitrite
concentration in the thickening effluent falls within the lower range of data reported in existing
literature (0-45 mg-NH4/L, 0-30 mg-NOx/L) 41. These concentrations are potentially influenced
by the amount of wash water used in the thickening centrifuges.

3.1.3 Concentration of Calcium and Magnesium
Ionic species such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, often used as indicators of water hardness, provide
insights into the scaling potential of WWTPs 47. Furthermore, these cations play a role in
estimating the nutrient recovery potential from wastewater due to their ability to react with
phosphate and ammonium. Figures 2d and 2e show the concentrations of Ca and Mg,
respectively, present in the sampled wastewater.
The concentration of calcium in the anaerobic effluent from Southerly Columbus ranges
from 22 to 38 mg/L, whereas in the aerobic effluent from Athens, it fluctuates between 73 and
240 mg/L. The hardness of drinking water in the city of Athens, 146 mg/L 48 is higher, on
average, than that in the city of Columbus 92-125 mg/L on an annual basis 49. This difference in
water hardness may contribute to the observed differences in calcium concentration between the
two WWTPs. The higher calcium concentration in the Athens samples, coupled with the low
ammonium ions concentration shown in Figure 2b, suggests that phosphorus recovery via
calcium-based phosphates, such as hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is a more feasible route
than magnesium-based phosphates e.g. struvite (NH4MgPO4.6H2O) precipitation in this
treatment plant. Conversely, the low calcium concentration in Columbus anaerobic effluent
indicated that the impact of Ca as a competing ion for phosphate recovery through struvite
precipitation may be negligible, provided there is sufficient Mg available for the reaction.
Furthermore, a Mg:Ca molar ratio of about 2 or higher is required for fast struvite growth
and a short induction time 50. Ojoawo and Daramola have also reported the significance of a
Mg:Ca molar ratio of 2.1 for efficient electrochemical phosphorus recovery from animal
wastewater 24. According to Figure 2e, the magnesium concentration in the anaerobic effluent is
21

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gwpw5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6737-415X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

lower than that in the aerobic effluent, initially suggesting that more external Mg would be
required for struvite precipitation in the anaerobic effluent, without considering the ammonium
content. However, a more detailed examination of the Mg:Ca molar ratios in the two samples
shows that the anaerobic effluent has an average of 0.82 compared to 0.31 in the aerobic effluent.
This implies that a lesser amount of Mg is required to achieve the reported Mg:Ca molar ratio
conducive for efficient struvite recovery in the anaerobic effluent compared to aerobic effluent.
3.1.4 Organic Content (Total Organic Carbon)
Figure 2f presents the concentration levels of total organic carbon in the three sampled
wastewater sources. The presence of organic matter in wastewater, such as organic carbon, can
adversely impact the nucleation and growth of phosphate precipitate such as struvite, by blocking
active growth sites of the struvite nuclei due to the coprecipitation of organic matter 51.
Therefore, it is important to assess the impact of TOC on P recovery from municipal wastewater
due to its complex matrix. Extensive literature data on the TOC concentration of post-digester
municipal wastewater is lacking. However, untreated wastewater influent typically contains
about 109-328 mg/L TOC, while activated sludge with biological nutrient removal (AC-BNR)
effluent tends to have approximately 10-20 mg/L TOC 41. A comparison of this data with Figure
2f suggests that a substantial portion of the organic carbon removed during secondary treatment
(i.e. AC-BNR) is released after anaerobic digestion which has a supernatant with TOC
concentration ranging from 166-270 mg/L. Columbus thickening process, which reduces
activated sludge volume before anaerobic digestion, has an effluent TOC concentration between
12-25 mg/L, consistent with the AC-BNR values. Athens WWTP, a conventional activated
sludge plant, has an aerobic effluent with TOC concentration between 18-41 mg/L, similar to
values reported by Metcalf et al. 41.

3.1.5 Heavy Metals
It is important to also consider that municipal wastewater contains pollutants such as
heavy metals, which could co-precipitate with phosphate compounds, and limit its use as a
fertilizer. Heavy metal contaminants such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, lead, and
others can be toxic based on continuous exposure over a long period. For instance, long-term
exposure to lead causes mental impairment, cadmium has adverse effects on the kidney, liver,
and gastrointestinal tract, while arsenic can lead to skin poisoning 52. Moreover, the remediation
of soils contaminated with heavy metals is a highly costly process; therefore, prevention of
pollution caused by heavy metals is important 52. Table S5 presents the average concentrations of
heavy metals in the effluents in comparison with the EPA’s maximum limits for heavy metals in
sludge intended for to soil application. The data from the table shows that the concentration of
heavy metal pollutants in the liquid portion of the wastewater streams are within the parts per
billion range, significantly lower than the EPA’s ppm thresholds for sludge.
3.1.6 Time Series Analyses
Given the variability in the wastewater compositions, time series analyses were used to
explore correlations among pH, nutrient levels, ionic and heavy metals species, and how they
changed with respect to each other over the one-year sampling period. Each species’ time series
data was first tested for stationarity with stationarity defined as an integration value of zero (0)
for a stationary data series (the mean, variation, and autocorrelation structure do not change with
time) and integration value of one (1) for a time series that is non-stationary. A summary of the
integration values of each species in each of the three streams is given in Table S6.

Based upon correlations, cross-correlations, and regressions between various stream
species (within each individual stream), four major findings were concluded from the time series
analyses: 1) Ortho-P and ammonia did not exhibit a significant relationship in any stream tested,
2) there exist relationships between Ca, Mg, and Ortho-P in the Columbus anaerobic and Athens
aerobic streams, 3) Zn2+ showed no significant relationship with respect to nutrients in any
stream tested, and 4) stream pH is related to both Ortho-P and Cl concentrations in the Columbus
anaerobic and Athens aerobic streams.
In general, the Columbus thickening stream exhibited differing behavior from the two
other streams. Equations 7 and 8 below are the regression equations found to best fit the
relationship between Ca and Ortho-P (denoted POrtho) in the Columbus anaerobic stream and the
Athens aerobic stream, respectively. Note that the differenced stream species concentration (∆)
must be used when determining relationships between species with different integration values
(Table S6), with the (∆) being applied to the species having the higher integration value. The
time variable (t) denotes the sample time interval (two weeks in this study) and thus, t is in units
of 2 weeks. All concentrations are in ppm and pH is reported in standard pH units.

The Athens aerobic stream also exhibited significant relationships between Mg and
Ortho-P (Equation 9) and Ca and Mg (Equation 10). Similar relationships for the Columbus
anaerobic stream were determined to be insignificant.

The pH values of Columbus anaerobic and Athens aerobic streams were determined to be
dependent on both Ortho-P and Cl concentrations. Equations 11 and 12 below show these
relationships for the Columbus anaerobic stream while Equations 13 and 14 describe the Athens
aerobic stream. Note that the following regressions are in log-based pH units and therefore have
small regression equation coefficients. Completing the analysis on a proton concentration basis
did not change the resulting relationships.

These general results can be used to frame the considerations necessary when developing
a side-stream P recovery system for a specific WWTP. First, because Ortho-P and ammonia
behaved independently of one another within the tested streams, a system designed for struvite
recovery may necessitate monitoring of both nutrients. Also, if a thickening stream is to be used
for P recovery, separate considerations will be necessary as the thickening stream had very little
interdependence among its stream species concentrations. Finally, it was shown that major ions
(Ca and Mg) exhibit an interdependence on nutrient concentrations (Ortho-P) and stream pH is
interdependent with Ortho-P and Cl in both post-digester streams i.e., the Columbus anaerobic
and Athens aerobic streams. These relationships may be leveraged to simplify sensing or process
controls to adjust stream chemistry for efficient P recovery. Lastly, recognizing the differences
between the digesters that these streams flow out from: anaerobic for Columbus versus aerobic

for Athens stream, suggest further investigations into the biological processes within these
digester types could be beneficial for understanding the compositional variability for nutrient
recovery applications.

Evaluation of the Key Variables in Electrified Nutrient Recovery

3.2.1 Screening of Significant Variables for P % Recovery
The regression models and associated R-squared values, evaluating the relationship
between the variables and system responses are shown in Table S7 and Table S8, for SS316 and
SS304, respectively. The statistical parameters for these linear regression models are provided in
Table S9 (SS316) and Table S10 (SS304), while the normal probability plots of the residuals for
SS316 and SS304 are shown in Figure S2a and Figure S2b, respectively. The R-squared values
are 0.98 and above, and the residual of the models follow a straight line, indicative of the model's
reliability. After performing the statistical screening analysis, the Pareto chart of the standardized
effects for both SS types are shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.

For SS316, seven out of ten variables had a significant influence. However, the first five
factors in Figure 3a with t-values at least three times the threshold of 2.12, had more pronounced
27

effects on the P % Recovery. These variables in the order of importance are anode type, NH4
concentration, cathodic potential, P concentration and temperature. In the SS304 block, all
variables except for turbulence were significant. Similarly, in this block, emphasis was placed on
the variables that have a more significant impact on the response, specifically those with a tvalue exceeding three times the threshold of 2.11. These variables are anode type, cathodic
potential, P concentration, NH4 concentration, temperature and TOC, respectively. As it can be
noticed from the list of the key variables in the two blocks, regardless of the order, there are five
overlapping important factors for both SS316 and SS304. However, it is noteworthy that each
block exhibits its unique magnitude of variable effects, and no single factor exerts identical
influence on both SS types. Despite the difference in the magnitude of the effects, using a Mg
anode (as opposed to a graphite anode), along with the presence of NH4, a more negative
cathodic potential and a higher temperature each led to an increased P recovery for both SS
cathodes. Conversely a higher initial concentration of P (300 ppm) yields a lower percentage
recovery, although the absolute quantity of P recovery in ppm was generally higher. For
example, a 37 ppm initial P concentration with a 100 % P recovery will give only 28 mg of
recovered P while a 300 ppm initial P with recovery as low as 15% gives 34 mg of recovered P.
The literature supports the higher P recovery by using an Mg anode and solutions with
higher NH4 concentration; furthermore, high N:P ratios promote struvite precipitation, which is
one of the methods of P recovery 19,53,54. Lui et al. showed a directly proportional relationship
between temperature and P recovery for P concentrations below 400 ppm, which is consistent
with the findings of this study 55. However, some studies with a focus on P recovery as struvite,
reported a higher P recovery at lower temperatures 54,56,57. This can be explained by considering
the presence of other P-containing products apart from struvite in the screening experiments i.e.,
28

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gwpw5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6737-415X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

while struvite recovery is improved at lower temperatures, other P-containing solids have
improved recovery at higher temperatures. Lastly, more negative cathodic potentials are reported
in literature58 to result in higher P recoveries, by producing more OH- ions due to the Equation 1
or 2, thereby increasing the pH and facilitating the precipitation of P-containing compounds.
Apart from the five variables discussed above, initial TOC is a key factor with a directly
proportional effect on P % recovery for SS304, however, it was found unimportant for SS316.
One category of organic carbon is natural organic matter (NOM). This group contains
decomposed humic and nonhumic substances with heavy, long chain molecules and several
functional groups 59. Lei et al. showed the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) increased
the P recovery by coprecipitation with calcium phosphate 60. Conversely, Wang et al. suggested
that if the product of interest is struvite, organic compounds with smaller molecular weights offer
higher P recovery with better product purity 61. Considering the TOC in this synthetic water
analyses was the formate ion, which is smaller than a typical heavy organic carbon present in
municipal wastewater, the directly proportionality between TOC and P recovery could be
explained by the possibility of P mostly recovered as struvite. However, this hypothesis is more
likely for the cases where the concentration of Mg in the stream is higher than Ca.
3.2.2 Screening of Significant Variables for ln (Es)
Given the substantial disparity in the Es magnitudes as seen in Figure S3, the screening
analysis was conducted using the natural logarithm (ln) of Es instead of the original values to
linearize the response and reduce the distance between the data points. This is beneficial
considering the regression analyses in the screening section is based on a combination of linear
terms and distant data values might potentially increase the error in the model’s prediction. The
29

results of the statistical analysis on Es for SS316 are displayed in Figure 3c and Table S11, while
the normal probability plot for the regression model is in Figure S2c. The same information for
SS304 is shown in Figure 3d, Table S12, and Figure S2d. Among the ten variables evaluated,
seven had significant impact on Es in the SS316 block, with the first five factors in the Pareto
chart exerting the most noticeable impact, having a t-value more than three times the threshold of
2.12. These variables were initial P concentration, anode type, temperature, cathodic potential
and NH4 concentration, respectively. In the SS304 block, all variables were recognized to be
influential on Es and seven of these variables were most noticeable, with a t-value greater than
three times the threshold (2.11). Consequently, the overlapping important factors in both SS316
and SS304 with a t-value over three times the threshold are initial P concentration, anode type,
cathodic potential, NH4 concentration and temperature.
A higher initial P and an Mg anode resulted in a decrease in Es. On the other hand, a
graphite anode, a more negative cathodic potential, the presence of NH4 and a higher temperature
increased Es. It is important to acknowledge that in Equation 6, the denominator is the mass of
the recovered product. As explained in the previous section, a higher initial phosphorus
concentration will most likely result in a greater mass of the product. This, in turn, increases the
denominator value in Equation 6. On the other hand, the numerator in this formula is the actual
energy consumed which is the integral of the product of the cell voltage and generated current.
Therefore, increasing the concentration of phosphate ions will result in lower ionic resistance and
higher current, therefore potentially increasing the numerator. However, it is plausible that the
denominator has a higher order of increase in comparison to the numerator, resulting in an
overall decrease in the Es with a higher initial P. Higher Es has also been observed in
electrochemical nutrient recovery using streams with lower initial P concentration in literature 58.

Additionally, a smaller Es with utilization of an Mg anode could be attributed to a smaller
magnitude of the average cell voltage using this anode (typically 2V less than the graphite
anode), and higher mass of recovered product obtained as explained in the previous section. This
would result in lower energy consumption as defined in Equation 6.
A more negative applied cathodic potential is expected to increase the average cell
voltage and generated current. On the other hand, this more negative applied potential also
increases the P % recovery, vide supra, which does not necessarily translate to a higher amount
of recovered P in all cases. Consequently, it is possible that the more negative potential will exert
a more pronounced positive effect on the numerator of the Es formula, resulting in an overall
increase in Es. Wang et al. also observed an increase in the Es with a more negative applied
potential 58. As for the NH4 concentration, the presence of this ion increases the P % recovery,
but not necessarily the amount of P recovered. On the other hand, the presence of 1000 ppm of
this ion in the electrolyte could aid in increasing the generated current due to decreased
electrolyte resistance. It is possible that this high concentration of NH4 could increase the current
more significantly than increasing the ppm P recovered and therefore due to the Equation 6,
causing an overall increase in Es.
Finally, a higher temperature will result in an increased Mg corrosion in water as
described in Equation 362, which concurrently increases the pH, based on the ability of sacrificial
magnesium to also enhance the cathodic reaction for hydroxide generation63. This higher pH
leads to greater precipitation by shifting the equilibrium for phosphate speciation towards anions
that precipitate: HPO42– and PO43–. On the other hand, a higher temperature also facilitates
improved reaction kinetics and ion mobility resulting in an increased generated current.
Consequently, the positive effect of higher temperature on the current could be more significant

than the recovered product, resulting in a directly proportional relationship between temperature
and Es.
3.2.3 Comparison of SS316 and SS304 Performances
Figure 4a depicts P % Recovery KDE distributions for each SS type. Comparing these
graphs reveals a comparable overall spread of data and curve behavior for both SS blocks, with a
notable exception: in the range of approximately 40-80% recovery, SS304 showed no recovery
activity. Furthermore, upon closer examination of the bar graph presented in Figure 4b, it is
evident that experiment types 11 and 12 exhibit a more significant difference between the two
cathode types with no overlap in the uncertainties and SS316 providing higher recoveries. Given
the superiority of SS316's corrosion resistance compared to SS304 in chloride solutions due to a
slower dissolution of the oxide passive film on the surface 64 and considering that the electrolyte
contains more than 300 ppm of Cl- in all experiments, it is conceivable that SS304 might have
experienced diminished stability, leading to a compromised performance in experiment types 11
and 12.

In experiment type 11, temperature and cathodic potential are low, while P initial
concentration is high. By comparing the magnitudes and direction of effects in the Pareto charts
in Figure 3a and Figure 3b, it is evident that even though the direction of the effects for these
three factors are the same in both SS blocks, but they have a more pronounced impact (higher tvalues) on the response for SS304. This implies that a less negative cathodic potential and lower
temperature, along with a higher initial P, decrease SS304's P recovery to a greater extent than
SS316’s P recovery. However, the individual factors also have interactions themselves, e.g. low
temperature may lead to slower kinetics, and the combination of a low temperature with low
applied potential and low agitation could introduce a much lower P recovery. Therefore, under
conditions where all the factors have a significant effect i.e., SS304 as opposed to SS316, the
combined effect on P recovery is more pronounced.
On the other hand, experiment 12 involves a low cathodic potential, a small area-volume
ratio, no NH4, and a high initial P. The same scenario applies here: factors that are inversely
impacting the P recovery exert a more negative impact on the SS304’s response and the potential
interaction between these variables might make this inhibition even stronger in SS304 as
opposed to SS316. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure S4 the KDE distributions for ln (Es) of each
SS type indicate dissimilar trends between these two cathode types, providing additional
evidence of distinct electrochemical behaviors in each of these respective cases. As evident from
Figure S3, SS304 has lower Es magnitudes and due to the comparable P recoveries in most cases
for the two SS types (denominator of Equation 6), the lower Es in the SS304 case with the same
applied potential, could be due to lower current generated. This may be attributed to a less
current generated in this SS type due to a possible diminished electrical property in an
environment containing Cl– 64.

3.2.4 Screening Summary and Transitioning Toward Optimization
Overall, regardless of the magnitude of the effects, the same five key factors emerge as
significant for both SS types for P % recovery and Es responses: anode type, cathodic potential,
initial P and NH4 concentration and temperature. Therefore, an optimization analyses for nutrient
recovery with P % recovery and Es as the key responses focused on these five variables. The
electrolyte that provides the most significant opportunity for recovery, based on high nutrient
contents was the anaerobic digester effluent which provided a source of real wastewater but
negates the ability to vary nutrient concentrations. Furthermore, considering the anode type is the
most important variable and the Mg anode favors a desired outcome in both responses – high
amount of P recovered and low energy consumption – Mg was the anode in the optimization
experiments. SS304 was chosen as the cathode over SS316, since both cathodes yielded a
comparable level of P recovery in over 80% of the experiments (Figure 4) and SS304 is less
costly than SS316. These conditions simplified our number of independent factors from 5 to 2:
temperature and cathodic potential. The electrode size was included as the third variable since it
was a variable above the threshold of significance in both electrodes (Figure 3) and this value
provides significance in evaluating cost analyses for the Mg anode. Therefore, the optimization
analysis with respect to the electrode area places emphasis on identifying the optimum size rather
than merely selecting the maximum size.

Optimization of the P Recovery from Real Wastewater

3.3.1 Effect of Residence Time on P Recovery
In contrast to the six-hour duration of the screening analysis, phosphorus recovery
occurred significantly faster in the optimization experiments, as illustrated in Figure 5. This
could be attributed to both the higher pH of the real wastewater (6.46 – 8.02 for the 100 MGD

plant) in comparison to the synthetic wastewater (6.25) and the use of the magnesium alloy as
the anode. The pH level of the wastewater is an important factor for phosphorus recovery as it
influences both the solubility of the precipitate and the solution supersaturation 65,66. The high pH
level in the real wastewater corresponds to a shorter time for the pH to increase to conditions
where phosphorus recovery is most favorable, while the magnesium alloy also contributes to an
accelerated overall pH increase in the system. These conditions are responsible for the increase
in the bulk pH (8.28-9.10) of the wastewater after the electrochemical recovery experiment.
As shown in Figure 5, the average phosphorus recovery for all the runs was
approximately 30 ± 11 % at 5 minutes, 45 ± 14 % at 10 minutes, 70 ± 14 % at 20 minutes, 87 ±
12 % at 30 minutes, 97 ± 3 % at 60 minutes, 98 ± 0.6 % at 90 minutes and 98.3 ± 0.3 % at 120
minutes. The variation within the data points, indicated by the standard deviation, significantly
diminished after 30 minutes, signifying that beyond this time, varying the process conditions has
minimal impact on phosphorus recovery efficiency. However, this does not negate the need for
process condition optimization, as these variables also influence energy consumption and
synthesis time, which must be optimized. Kékedy-Nagy et al. in their study on electrochemical
nutrient removal using Mg anode and various natural wastewaters with initial pH levels ranging
from 7.9 to 10.2, similarly reported phosphate removal efficiency between 44% and 93% within
30 minutes 23. Therefore, this present study used 30 minutes as a threshold and developed a
model at this time mark to describe the relationships between the factors and the system
response, while also predicting the optimum conditions for maximum phosphorus recovery and
minimum energy consumption.

Figure 5: Heatmap of P recovery under different process condition, illustrating the effect of
residence time on electrochemical phosphorus recovery. Notably, after a residence time of 30
minutes, P recovery approaches 100% across all tested conditions, indicating that beyond this
threshold, the effect of the process variables becomes negligible, as the recovery efficiency nears
its maximum potential.

3.3.2 Response Surface Analyses and Model Validation
The regression models presented in the screening phase serves the purpose of eliminating
less significant variables but does not capture the response's curvature, i.e., any non-linearity in
the responses since there are only two points per variable. In this section, three distinct secondorder models were constructed to characterize P recovery and Es outcomes from the optimization
experiments at the 30-minute time mark. These models included linear and square terms (SM),
linear and interaction terms (IM), and full quadratic terms (FM). The regression equations and
their associated R-squared values for P recovery and Es responses are detailed in Table S13 and
36

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gwpw5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6737-415X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Table S14, respectively. Based on these tables, the order of decreasing R-squared value of the
models are FM, SM and IM. It is important to note that, as real wastewater was used in this set of
experiments, the composition of ions could not be controlled in different experiments 67 and
therefore, the responses exhibited less reproducibility, resulting in a model with smaller Rsquared values (0.55 - 0.80) compared to the screening analysis model (0.97-0.99). The Pareto
charts illustrating standardized effects for the two responses of the optimization experiments
(Figures S7 and S9), the normal probability plots (Figures S8 and S10) as well as the statistical
output (Tables S16 to S21) are provided in the supporting information.
These models combined with Minitab’s response optimizer predicted 3 distinct
conditions for maximum P % recovery – one for each model – and 2 distinct conditions for
minimum energy consumption – FM and IM predicted the same set of conditions. These
predicted optimization plots are illustrated in Figure S5 and Figure S6, while the optimum
conditions for each model and both responses are provided in Table S15. The five sets of
conditions were scaled down to two for model validation (Table 3): one set of conditions that
were predicted to optimize both system responses and another set with values that were most
different from this condition. Both conditions chosen were for maximum P % recovery, with the
rationale that a global maximum for P recovery coupled with a local minimum for energy
consumption, would be preferable to finding a global minimum for energy consumption and a
local maximum for P % recovery. These conditions will be referred to as the Square Model
Optimum Condition (SMOC) and the Interaction Model Optimum Condition (IMOC), based on
the models that were used to predict these conditions.

The experimental P recoveries and their corresponding specific energies obtained at the
SMOC and IMOC were 91.88% (0.96 kWh/kg P) and 94.60% (0.03 kWh/kg P), respectively.
Figure 6 shows the models contour plots for phosphorus recovery and specific energy
consumption, integrated with the experimentally obtained values. Although, the P recovery
models (Figure 6a and b) predicted values greater than 100% at the optimum conditions, the
experimental values are within the realistic range on the contour plots. Overall, the IMOC
outperforms the SMOC with a higher P recovery and significantly lower specific energy
consumption.

The Pareto charts in Figure S7 show that cathodic potential has the most significant effect
on the specific energy consumption and is also predicted to have some effect on the P %
recovery based on models that include interaction terms. Therefore, a cathodic potential of -1.29
V vs Ag/AgCl, predicted by the P recovery Square Model (SM), is expected to lead to high
polarization of the electrodes, thus increasing the energy consumption. Although this should
result in increased reaction kinetics and higher P recovery than the -0.805 V vs Ag/AgCl of
Interaction Model (IM), the more negative potential also increases the rate of hydrogen
generation, based on water reduction. This could reduce the surface area of the electrode
available for phosphorus deposition if the H2 bubbles are not quickly driven away by the
impeller, thereby contributing to the slightly lower P recovery at the SMOC. Therefore, the
optimum condition for high P recovery and low energy consumption, as predicted by the
interaction model and confirmed experimentally, is at a less negative cathodic potential of -0.805
V vs Ag/AgCl, a high electrode area-volume ratio of 0.145 cm-1, and a temperature of 41.3°C.
To evaluate the P recovery models’ predictability and behavior of the variables, the SM
was analyzed under both SMOC and IMOC, and a similar analysis was conducted for the IM, as
depicted in Figure 6. The contour plot of the P recovery based on SM (Figure 6a) shows that the
experimental P recovery at the SMOC (92%) falls below the SM predicted value (>100%),
indicating an overprediction. Conversely, the experimentally obtained value at the IMOC (95%)
closely aligns with the SM prediction at this condition (94%). Although the SM accurately
predicts P recovery under the IMOC, this condition is in a region of the SM contour plot
predicted to have a lower P recovery than SMOC. This suggests that the square model predicted
optimum is not the true optimum region, challenging the response behavior of the variables as
predicted by the model.

In contrast, the interaction model predictions overestimate P recovery (>100%) at the
IMOC (95%) and underestimates it (80%) at the SMOC (92%) as shown in Figure 6b.
Nonetheless, the IM’s predicted optimum region aligns with experimental observation.
Therefore, the IM proved more accurate for describing the relationship between the variables and
P recovery. The IM indicates that at an area-volume ratio between 0.8 and 0.9, P recovery ranges
between 85 and 90% and this recovery is consistent regardless of changes in the cathodic
potential. However, outside this ratio, P recovery becomes more dependent on the cathodic
potential. In the range of -0.7 to -1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl, P recovery increases with an increase in the
area-volume ratio. Conversely, within the -1.2 to -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl range, P recovery decreases
as the area-volume ratio increases. These observations offer insights into the cathodic potential
threshold for electrochemical phosphorus recovery. Particularly, these suggests that at potentials
greater than -1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, the increased generation of hydrogen gas, as previously
discussed, could limit the solid-state growth of phosphate compounds.
The specific energies obtained experimentally under optimum phosphorus recovery
conditions were compared with the Es models in Figure 6c and d. Despite the Es models’
predictions being inaccurate, the substantial difference in energy values obtained experimentally
at the SMOC (0.96 kWh/kg P) and IMOC (0.03 kWh/kg P) confirms the pronounced color
contrast observed at these two points in the models. The specific energy consumed, as described
in Equation 6, increases as cathodic potential becomes more negative and decreases as the
amount of recovered phosphorus increases. Interestingly, at the P recovery IM in Figure 6b, the
less negative cathodic potential and high area-volume ratio correlates with high phosphorus
recovery. This correlation explains the apparent inverse relationship between the phosphorus
recovery IM in Figure 6b and the specific energy IM in Figure 6d.

Phase Identification of the Recovered Products and Process Energy comparison
During the optimization experiments, precipitation occurred at the surfaces of the

electrodes and in the bulk electrolyte. The recovered products showed multiple sharp peaks in
the X-ray diffractograms in over 75% of the analyzed samples, which revealed that the recovered
materials were predominantly crystalline. The remaining samples had little to no significant
sharp diffraction peaks, an indicator of amorphous phase. Further examination of representative
samples of the recovered crystalline products using SEM as depicted in Figure 7, showed these
materials predominately consist of orthorhombic crystalline shapes, with a smaller portion
having a thin platelet shape. The combination of different shapes is an indicator of a nonhomogenous morphology in these samples. Finally, the EDS analyses indicated precipitates are
primarily composed of Mg and P, with minimal Ca presence in both crystalline and amorphous
groups of products.
The Rietveld refinement of the diffractograms of the mostly crystalline samples show
struvite ICSD-60262 (ICSD web version 5.2.0) 68,69 as the major component with a volume
fraction range of 87-91%. These samples also contained some amount of K-struvite (MgKPO4•6
H2O), ICSD30504 (ICSD web version 5.2.0) 69,70, with a range of 9-13%. The raw and refined
XRD pattern of a representative sample is depicted in Figure 7c, with an Rw of 10.459 after
refinement, consisting of 91% struvite and 9% K-struvite.

In addition, based on the SEM images represented in Figure 7a and b, while all these
materials predominantly consisted of well-defined orthorhombic crystalline shapes, they had
different sizes: there were small crystals with a length of 22 – 38 μm and larger crystals with
lengths in the 82 – 131 μm range with a repetitive pattern in each agglomerate. Since struvite has
a nucleation and growth type of formation 12, these length differences are probably due to the
difference in the time the crystal has had to nucleate and grow.
Furthermore, the smaller amorphous fraction, which consist primarily of Mg and P as
well, are likely an amorphous magnesium phosphate precipitate. However, since amorphous
materials are a non-equilibrium category of compounds 71, the occurrence of an amorphous phase
could be attributed to insufficient aging, i.e., before reaching equilibrium, for the crystalline
phase. Ziegenheim et al. and Al-Hamzah et al. showed brucite was formed in an amorphous state
when the experiment duration was short 72,73. Additionally, literature has shown that while
precipitating struvite or K-struvite (MgKPO4.6 H2O) 74,75, an amorphous transition state occurred
before the final crystallization step. Therefore, it is possible that the recovered products in the
amorphous category of this study are also struvite, but precipitated quickly and require more than
a 2-hour length-scale for crystallization . However, this hypothesis needs to be further tested via
approaches that correlate precipitate size with crystalline or amorphous character and
experimental conditions in a future work.
Lastly, the optimized electrochemical recovery process demonstrated a remarkably low
energy consumption of 0.03 kWh/kg P, contrasting sharply with the global energy requirement
for phosphorus fertilizer production in 2019, which stood at 1.15 kWh/kg P 76. Additionally, the
recovered phosphorus product in this study is predominantly struvite which creates opportunities

for further comparison with other electrochemical nutrient recovery processes that also utilize
magnesium anodes to produce struvite. Hug and Udert reported energy consumption ranging
from 0.1 to 2.2 kWh/kg P at 75% recovery, depending on the anodic potential 77. Another study
with synthetic wastewater reported a specific energy consumption value of 0.031 kWh/kg P at
500 mM Cl-, which is not typical of municipal wastewater, and a range of 0.09 to 0.18 kWh/kg P
for 5-50 mM Cl-, a range more realistic for municipal wastewater 78. These comparisons
highlight the potential of the optimized electrochemical process in reducing the energy
consumption of the aeration process in wastewater treatment plant through recovery of nutrients
from the centrate stream, and also decreasing the national/global energy requirement for fertilizer
production.

Conclusion
This comprehensive study investigated the characteristics of different municipal

wastewater streams (aerobic, anaerobic dewatering and anaerobic thickening effluent) for
nutrient recovery potential, screened out the unimportant operational, design and stream
variables in electrochemical nutrient recovery and optimized these variables to maximize
phosphorus recovery and minimize specific energy consumptions. The wastewater sampling
showed a high calcium concentration in Athens aerobic, which, when coupled with its low
ammonium concentration, suggests that phosphorus recovery via calcium phosphates, such as
hydroxyapatite, is a more feasible route than struvite precipitation in this treatment plant. On the
other hand, the low calcium concentration in Columbus anaerobic effluent indicated that the
impact of calcium as a competing ion for phosphate recovery through struvite precipitation may
be negligible, provided there is sufficient magnesium available for the reaction. Time series

analysis of the year-long sampling data revealed that major ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ exhibited
interdependence with Ortho-P concentration. Additionally, the stream pH was found to correlate
with Ortho-P and Cl- in the anaerobic dewatering streams.
Screening analysis of electrochemical nutrient recovery identified anode type, cathodic
potential, initial P concentration, initial NH4 concentration and temperature to be the most
important variables for phosphorus recovery and energy consumption, with either SS316 or
SS304 as the cathode. However, the SS316 typically provided higher P recovery than SS304. In
the optimization analysis, phosphorus recovery occurs significantly faster, due to the higher pH
in the real wastewater. Consequently, phosphorus recovery peaks after 30 minutes of an
experimental run; thus, minimizing the impact of the process variables. The optimum condition
for high P recovery and low specific energy consumption from the anaerobic digester wastewater
was a cathodic potential of -0.805 V vs Ag/AgCl, electrode area-volume ratio of 0.145 cm-1, and
a temperature of 41.3°C, as predicted by the interaction model and confirmed experimentally.
Finally, solid characterization of the recovered products from the optimization analyses revealed
a combination of struvite (87-91%) and K-struvite (9-13%), with traces of calcium deposits.
Future work should investigate the potential for real-world pilot demonstrations at WWTPs
supported by cost estimation of fertilizer production at different WWTP scales.
