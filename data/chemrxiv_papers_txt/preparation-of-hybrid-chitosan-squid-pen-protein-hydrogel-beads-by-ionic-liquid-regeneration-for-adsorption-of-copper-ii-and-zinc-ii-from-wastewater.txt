Abstract: This study explores the use of squid pen protein to enhance the mechanical properties, chemical
stability, and heavy metal ion (Cu2+ and Zn2+) affinity of β-chitosan. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazilium acetate
([BMIM][OAc]) was used to functionalize β-chitosan and prepare hydrogel beads with improved structural
integrity and batch uniformity. However, initial experiments noted a reduction in adsorption capacity as the squid
pen protein content increased, with Cu2+ and Zn2+ adsorption being particularly inhibited at lower pH levels due
to protonation. Subsequent batch adsorption studies identified optimal conditions for Cu 2+ and Zn2+ uptake and
revealed that adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, indicating chemisorption. The equilibrium
isotherms corresponded with the Langmuir model, suggesting monolayer coverage with maximum adsorption
capacities of 70.2 mg g-1 for Cu2+ and 24.0 mg g-1 for Zn2+. The potential of squid pen protein as an economical
filler for β-chitosan-based adsorbents was validated alongside the efficiency of using [BMIM][OAc] for the nontoxic functionalization of β-chitosan. Support of green chemistry principles was evidenced by a high atom
economy and low environmental impact, indicating a sustainable method for preparing effective biosorbents.

Introduction

address the operational limitations associated with powdered or
non-structured adsorbents. Additionally, their favourable
hydrodynamic behaviour and regular packing confer immense
amenability to scale-up under low-pressure conditions without
requiring microstructure optimisation, a critical consideration
for competing technologies such as two-dimensional materialbased (2DM-based) adsorbents.6, 12
Chemical crosslinking is the primary strategy for enhancing
the stability of chitosan in acidic media. Polymeric networks,
with enhanced acidic resistance, are prepared by exploiting the
ability of bifunctional crosslinkers to covalently bridge
chitosan chains at amine or hydroxyl sites. 8 The preservation of
hydrogel structure in acidic media allows for regeneration.
However, most crosslinkers are toxic and impart impaired mass
transfer as well as brittleness. 10 The affinity of crosslinkers
towards amine groups is an additional challenge, resulting in
reduced negative surface charge and adsorption capacity.
Currently the most reliable and utilized crosslinker is
glutaraldehyde, which targets amine sites by imine (Schiff)
bond formation.8
Ionic liquids (ILs) are compounds, comprised of anions and
cations, with melting points not exceeding 100 ℃. IL treatment
or solubilization is a novel strategy for functionalizing chitosan.
This method functions by reducing the crystallinity of chitosan
through the rearrangement of chitosan’s linear chains. 11, 13 The
disruption of inter- and intra-molecular bonds in the amorphous
and crystalline regions of chitosan occurs due to the anions of
ILs possessing high hydrogen bond accepting abilities, which
effectively enable the formation of hydrogen bonds with amine
and hydroxyl groups.14 The merit of IL solubilization as a novel
synthesis strategy is supported by the limited uptake of metal
ions by chitosan’s crystalline planes, with chelation occurring
exclusively on the amorphous regions. 15
IL treatment is operationally simple. It resembles the phase
separation method for bead preparation using dilute organic
acids. The key difference is regeneration in ethanol or water
via an antisolvent mechanism rather than neutralization in
alkaline media. 13, 16 This is advantageous as it enables solvent

Heavy metal ions are a significant class of pollutants. 1 Incidents
of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic effects on humans
have been attributed to certain species. 2 The danger posed by
heavy metal ions is exemplified by their potency at innocuous
concentrations, high mobility and longevity in organisms due
to bioaccumulation.3 Heavy metals of high priority include
copper (Cu 2+), cadmium (Cd 2+) and zinc (Zn2+).1
Adsorption is a promising strategy for the cost-effective and
energy-efficient treatment of dilute effluents. Minimum waste
is produced owing to regeneration and recycling of adsorbent. 4
However, conventional carbon- and mineral-based adsorbents
are limited by complex synthesis methods and susceptibility to
severe loss of efficiency after just a few regeneration cycles,
respectively.5 Moreover, traditional powder adsorbents remain
infeasible for commercial adoption due to the economic and
time constraints of post-treatment separation and recovery,
which often involve precipitation, centrifugation or filtration. 6
The poor economic robustness of traditional adsorbents has
invigorated interest in cost-effective alternatives, particularly
biosorbents. Chitosan, the N-deacetylated derivative of chitin,
is promising due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, costeffectiveness and high capacity for heavy metal ion uptake. 3, 7
Specifically, β-chitosan, the morphological variant possessing
parallel arrangement of adjacent polymer chains, has garnered
significant attention.8 This is due to the more simple extraction
of β-chitin from squid waste compared to that of α-chitin from
crustaceans. Extraction of β-chitin is less resource-intensive
due to squid pens being almost entirely β-chitin and proteins at
49.0% and 46.23%, respectively.9 Moreover, β-chitin is more
soluble and reactive than α-chitin, resulting in more efficient
deacetylation.8 However, the progression of chitosan towards
utilization in commercial applications has been hindered by
low mechanical strength, substantial cost, inadequate chemical
stability in acidic media and limited access to binding sites. 10
The preparation of spherical hydrogel beads from chitosan
is a common modification for increasing porosity, surface area
and access to internal binding sites. 10, 11 Spherical beads also

recycling. IL systems also benefit from good thermal stability,
low vapour pressure and cosolvent compatibility. 14
1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([BMIM][OAc]) is
the IL reported to have the highest solvating ability for chitosan
with a maximum loading capacity of 8.40% at 100 ℃. 14
Additionally, the FT-IR spectrum of chitosan regenerated from
[BMIM][OAc] is not indicative of side reactions or the
production of ammonium salts, with the primary structure
remaining unaltered. However, [BMIM][OAc] is very viscous
with dimethyl sulfoxide commonly used as a cosolvent to
facilitate extrusion.16 Lastly, like other ILs, [BMIM][OAc] has
been reported in previous work to impart poor mechanical
properties on regenerated chitosan beads. 17
Interpenetrative blending facilitates augmenting chitosan’s
mechanical strength beyond recasting and has been coupled
with IL solubilization to compensate for enhanced brittleness.
Interpenetrated polymer networks (IPNs) are comprised of two
or more polymers, which have undergone molecular interlacing
through diffusion prior to being chemically crosslinked. 18 IPN
formulations are noteworthy for their idiosyncratic properties,
which can be tuned by altering the co-polymer dosage. Hybrid
chitosan-based materials have been reported with enhanced
chemical stability, mechanical properties and adsorption
capacities.8 The latter is influenced by the functional groups on
the blend polymer(s), with lower pKa values conferring higher
negative surface charge. 8 Polysaccharides and proteins are
promising blend polymers due to their hydroxyl, sulfhydryl,
amine and carboxyl content.
Squid pen (SP) protein, extracted alongside β-chitin from
squid gladii (or pens), is postulated to have a high diversity and
density of functional groups. The mechanical strength of squid
gladii provides motivation for suitability as a co-polymer on the
basis that β-chitosan and SP protein hybrid materials can be
reverse-engineered to have similar properties. Furthermore, SP
protein is an underutilized byproduct of β-chitosan production.
As such, its incorporation affords a valuable opportunity to
optimize the β-chitosan value chain while subsidizing the cost
of a hybrid biosorbent. Partially substituting β-chitosan with SP
protein, a starting material, also reduces the environmental
footprint of a hybrid biosorbent since chitin deacetylation
occurs at 100 – 160 ℃ over several hours and requires 40 –
50% sodium hydroxide.8
This study focused on the synthesis and characterization of
highly functionalized and mechanically enhanced hybrid
biosorbents from β-chitosan and SP protein by recasting from
[BMIM][OAc]. The effect of different SP protein content was
studied. The influence of solution pH, agitation period and
initial solution concentration on the adsorption of Cu 2+ and
Zn2+ by the biosorbents was investigated.

designation were obtained from Fisher Scientific. 1-Butyl-3methylimidazolium acetate ([BMIM][OAc]) was sourced from
Proionic, with a moisture content of 1.75% as determined on a
Karl Fischer C20 Coulometer (Mettler Toledo). Glutaraldehyde
solution (~50%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, analytical grade,
≥99.7%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2⸱6H2O, analytical
grade, ≥99.0%), and copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate
(CuSO4⸱5H2O, analytical grade, ≥99.0%) were sourced from
Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without modification
and stored as recommended.

Squid pen protein extraction
A slurry comprised of 5% squid pen (dry mass) was prepared
by the addition of a suitable volume of 0.5 M NaOH solution.
The slurry was stirred at 400 rpm and ambient temperature for
3 hours, then vacuum filtered. Isoelectric precipitation (pH 3.5)
was performed on the filtrate by the dropwise addition of 3M
HCl solution. A Jenway 3510 pH Meter (Cole Parmar) was
used for all pH-related measurements. The precipitated protein
was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes using a VWR Mega
Star 3.0 (Avantor). The supernatant was discarded while the
protein was washed with DI water 4 times. The washed protein
was immersed in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried for 48 hours
on a Freezone6 (Labconco).

Hydrogel bead preparation
Three distinct types of chitosan-SP protein hydrogel beads
were studied. These were designated as CH, CH-SQ-25 and
CH-SQ-50, with β-chitosan contents of 100%, 75% and 50%,
respectively. The remainder of their content being SP protein.
A batch-equivalent of casting solution was prepared from a
solvent system comprised of 12 g [BMIM][OAc] and 12 g
DMSO, to which β-chitosan and SP protein were added for a
total solid loading of 0.6 g (5% IL mass). The proportion of the
co-polymers was dependent on the bead type as previously
described. The dissolution of the dispersed polymers was
achieved through continuous stirring at 400 rpm and 100 ℃ for
20 hours. Each batch of casting solution was manually
extruded into 250 ml of absolute ethanol using an 18-g needle
(ID 0.838 mm) paired alongside a 3 ml syringe. During
extrusion, the casting solutions were maintained at 100 ℃ to
reduce viscosity and the 18-g needle was replaced upon
clogging. The regenerated hydrogel beads were left to cure for
20 hours in absolute ethanol under gentle stirring at 100 rpm.
The cured beads were removed from the ethanol-IL mixture by
filtration through a Büchner funnel. The filtrate was discarded.
However, the [BMIM][OAc]:DMSO = 1:1 solvent system was
recoverable by rotary evaporation. The recovered beads were
washed 3 times. This entailed adding the beads to 250 ml of DI
water and stirring at 100 rpm for an hour prior to filtration. The
washed beads were added to 100 ml of 0.25% glutaraldehyde
solution and crosslinked for 20 hours under gentle stirring at
100 rpm. A similar recovery and washing scheme as detailed
after curing was observed. The crosslinked beads were then
immersed in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried for 48 hours using
a Freezone6.

Experimental
Chemicals and Materials
β-chitosan (~580,000 Da) was purchased from Glentham Life
Sciences. The degree of deacetylation was 92% as determined
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using a JNM-ECZL
400S spectrometer (JEOL). Sieved squid pen was sourced
locally and determined to have a moisture content of 5% after
overnight drying at 105 ℃. Sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH,
98.8%) and absolute ethanol (≥96%) were sourced from VWR
Chemicals. Deionized (DI) water (≥18 MΩ) was obtained from
a Centra R200 (ELGA LabWater). Hydrochloric acid (HCl,
~37%) and nitric acid (HNO 3, ~67-69%) of TraceMetal™

remove excess water prior to being transferred into 12 ml of
100 ppm Cu 2+ or Zn2+ solutions at the various integer pH values
within the ranges. An initial pH method was used with the pH
value of the solutions not being adjusted during the adsorption
period. For consistency, the initial adjustments to the pH value
were done on 100 ml aliquots of 100 ppm Cu 2+ or Zn2+ solution
from the same stock solution. Solutions of 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1
M HCl were used to perform the initial adjustments. The
immersed beads were agitated/treated at 800 rpm for an hour.
The treated wastewater solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm
for 3 minutes, with acceleration and braking levels set at 9. The
supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter for analysis.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR)
The FT-IR spectra of β-chitosan, SP protein, and the hydrogel
beads were recorded on an Agilent Cary 630 (Agilent)
equipped with a Diamond-ATR sampling module obtained
from the same manufacturer. The hydrogel beads were
pulverized for analysis but otherwise remained unmodified.
The spectral acquisition was performed over the range of 4000
– 500 cm-1 with 32 sample scans at room temperature.

Zeta Potential
The mean zeta potentials of β-chitosan and SP protein were
determined using a Litesizer 500 (Anton Paar). The polymers
were suspended in DI water and loaded into omega cuvettes,
from the same manufacturer, for analysis. All measurements
were performed at room temperature.

Kinetic studies
CH-SQ-25 beads, the hybrid beads with the highest removal
efficiency in the pH studies, were utilized to obtain kinetic data.
Similarly, the optimum conditions from the previous section
were used to maximize adsorption. The experiments were
slightly modified from the pH studies. The scale was increased
four-fold to enable repeated sampling without vastly altering
the solution volume. Firstly, 0.1 g of CH-SQ-25 beads were
hydrated for 24 hours in 40 ml of DI water. The hydrated beads
were filtered to remove excess water and transferred to 48 ml
of 100 ppm Cu 2+ or Zn 2+ solution at the optimum pH value
(Cu2+ pH 5, Zn2+ pH 6). The immersed beads were agitate at
1200 rpm. The higher speed reflected the larger scale. A 1 ml
syringe was utilized for sample withdrawal at the following
time intervals: 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 3 hours, 6
hours, and 24 hours. The samples were filtered through a 0.2
μm filter for analysis.

Preparation of synthetic wastewater
Cu2+ and Zn2+ solutions with concentrations of 50, 100, 150,
200 and 250 ppm were prepared by dissolving the appropriate
amounts of either CuSO 4⸱5H2O or Zn(NO3)2⸱6H2O in DI water.

Adsorption Experiments
The adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel bead types were
assessed by batch studies involving the addition of hydrated
beads to either copper or zinc wastewater in 50 ml centrifuge
tubes. The agitation speed, solution volume, biosorbent mass
and metal ion concentration were dependent on the specific
experiment as described in the following sections. Equipmentwise, all instances of centrifugation and pH measurements were
performed on the aforementioned equipment while agitation
was provided using a Multi Reax Orbital Shaker (Heidolph).
The metal ion concentration, Ct, in the treated wastewater
samples was determined twice by inductively coupled plasma
mass spectroscopy on an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS (Agilent). A
dilution matrix comprised of 1% HCl and 2% HNO 3 was
utilized alongside commercial calibration standards. The
removal efficiency, Re, of heavy metal ions was calculated
according to the following equation:

Equilibrium studies
CH-SQ-25 beads and optimum conditions were used as stated
in the previous section. These experiments closely resembled
those performed by Sutirman et. al. 21 The main difference was
the selection of 50 – 250 ppm as the concentration range based
on studies conducted by Wittmer et. al. 16 For each study, 0.025
g of CH-SQ-25 beads were hydrated for 24 hours in 20 ml of
DI water. The hydrated beads were filtered to remove excess
water and transferred to 12 ml of Cu 2+ or Zn 2+ solution at the
various concentration and optimum pH value (Cu 2+ pH 5, Zn2+
pH 6). The beads were agitated at 900 rpm for 24 hours. The
slightly more intense agitation speed was selected to prevent
settling during the longer period. After 24 hours, the treated
wastewater solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3
minutes, with acceleration and braking levels set at 9. The
supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter for analysis.

Physical Characterization
Initial pH studies

The beads obtained by recasting from [BMIM][OAc] exhibited
less-defined geometries with increasing SP protein content. CH
beads were spherical, whereas CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads
were ellipsoidal with visible voidage. These findings were
supported by size measurements, which revealed an increase in
length and decrease in width at higher SP protein content
(Figure 1). Furthermore, all bead types displayed brittleness,
with CH-SQ-50 beads being the most fragile and pulverizing
when gently pressed.

Experiments relating to Cu 2+ were performed within the pH
range of 2 – 5. Meanwhile, experiments with Zn 2+ used the pH
range of 3 – 6. These pH ranges were suitable to prevent the
precipitation of the insoluble hydroxide complexes of the
respective metal ions. 19, 20 A slightly modified protocol
proposed by Sutirman et. al. was used for the experiments. 21
For each batch study, 0.025 g of each bead type were hydrated
in 20 ml of DI water. The hydrated beads were filtered to

Figure 1: Average size measurements and optical microscopy at 4X magnification of internal network of (A) CH beads, (B) CH-SQ-25 beads, (C) CH-SQ-50 beads

Optical microscopy was employed to examine the internal
network of the beads (Figure 1). CH beads revealed a dense
network of β-chitosan fibres characterized by homogenous
interweaving and very rough morphology. For CH-SQ-25 and
CH-SQ-50 beads, SP protein content resulted in heterogeneity
as evidenced by the presence of sections of poorly interwoven
fibres. Additionally, CH-SQ-50 beads revealed dense clumps
with very little or no discernible organization.
The non-uniformity of CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads
may indicate poor interlacing among the functional groups on
SP protein and β-chitosan. However, methodological factors
must also be considered. For example, the total solid loading
was maintained constant, which overlooked β-chitosan having
a larger molecular weight than SP protein. Consequentially, the
casting solutions for the different bead types had pronounced
variations in viscosity, an extrusion parameter which influences
porosity, surface area and shape.16 In practice, extrusion from
an 18-g needle may have been adequate for the highly viscous
casting solution of CH beads but unsuitable for the notably less
viscous casting solutions of CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads.
Similarly, SP protein was determined to enhance
brittleness. However, the brittleness of the CH beads was
indicative of other contributors. For example, crosslinking has
been associated with enhanced fragility. This was evident in
earlier experiments, such that the glutaraldehyde concentration

was maintained relatively low (0.25%) as a deterrent.
Therefore, IL treatment using [BMIM][OAc] must have also
imparted poor mechanical properties. This was consistent with
observations for chitosan regeneration from [BMIM][Cl], as
reported by Sun et. al. 13

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectra
FT-IR spectral analysis of β-chitosan and SP protein elucidated
the chemical and structural derivatives present on the polymer
chains (Figure 2). The spectrum for β-chitosan was consistent
with previous studies. The band at 3303 cm -1 related to overlap
between N—H and O—H stretching vibrations. 21 The band at
2864 cm-1 was allocated to symmetric and asymmetric C—H
and CH2 stretching.14, 21 The bands at 1645 and 1589 cm -1 were
due to C=O stretching (Amide I) of the residual acetamido
groups and N—H deformation vibrations of NH 2 groups
(Amide II), respectively. 21 The band at 1422 cm-1 was
attributed to N—H deformation vibrations of NH 2 while the
band at 1319 cm-1 related to C—N stretching vibrations. The
band at 1373 cm-1 was assigned to C—H deformation.22 The
bands at 1153 and 890 cm-1 were assigned to C—H stretching.23
Lastly, the prominent band at 1023 cm -1 was characteristic of
the C—O stretching vibrations of the C—O—C bridge.21, 22 For
SP protein, defining bands relating to secondary structure were

observed. The band at 1648 cm -1 was assigned to amide I
vibrations arising from C=O stretching while the band at 1514
cm-1 was the combination of C—N stretching and N—H
bending.24 The amide III band at 1237 cm -1 related to C—N
stretching and N—H bending. The band at 3276 cm -1 indicated
O—H stretching.
The spectra of β-chitosan and CH beads were compared to
assess the effectiveness of IL treatment in [BMIM][OAc] as a
functionalization strategy (Figure 2) Both spectra exhibited the
same bands, with negligible shifting. Notably, the bands at
3291 and 1029 cm-1 were considerably more intense for CH
beads. This corresponded with the enhanced inter- and
intramolecular interactions arising from the rearrangement of
β-chitosan’s crystalline planes by the acetate anions. 22
Additionally, the characteristic bands related to ammonium did
not decrease in intensity as expected after crosslinking. For
reference, decreases in band intensity at 3291, 1655, 1419,
1314 and 1151 cm-1 have been previously reported from
crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. 21, 25 The only indication of
crosslinking was the disappearance of the band at 1589 cm -1
related to N—H bending of NH 2 groups. Lastly, a band
indicative of aliphatic C—H stretching vibrations of methyl
groups on the [BMIM] cation appeared at 2922 cm -1 on the CH
beads’ spectrum serving as the only evidence of IL treatment
and suggesting inefficient curing or washing stages.26
Figure 3A illustrates the spectra for the various beads
types. Close similarity between the spectra was noted. Notably,
no contribution from SP protein was discerned on the spectra
for CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads. Additionally, the intensity
of the bands at 3291, 2867, 1419, 1370, 1314 and 1029 cm-1
decreased as the SP protein content increased, indicating that
the SP protein did not enhance the functional group density on
the biosorbents with β-chitosan being the primary contributor.
The 1700 – 1450 cm-1 spectral range offered insight in the
absence of discernible bands related to SP protein on the FT-IR
spectra for CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads. From Figure 3B,
it was observed that amide I vibrations were shared by SP
protein and CH beads (regenerated β-chitosan) at 1655 and
1648 cm-1, respectively. It is probable that hydrogen bonding
among the polymers resulted in the bands for CH beads and SP
protein shifting slightly and merging at 1653 cm -1 on the spectra

of CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads. As for the amide II band
present at 1514 cm-1 on the spectrum for SP protein, the absence
from the spectra of CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads has been
attributed to glutaraldehyde crosslinking.

Influence of pH
The effect of solution pH on the adsorption of heavy metal ions
by the different bead types was investigated to understand the
influence of surface charge. The determination of an optimum
pH value for the subsequent studies was an added objective.
The efficiency of Cu 2+ removal from a 100-ppm solution by
the different beads types was recorded for different pH values
after an hour of treatment (Figure 4A). All bead types exhibited
a similar pH dependence, with Cu 2+ uptake increasing sharply
over the pH range of 2 – 3, after which improvements became
gradual. Importantly, statistical differences were not noted at
higher pH levels (4 – 5). An optimum pH value of 5 was noted.

The removal of Zn2+ by the beads was investigated under
identical conditions (Figure 4B). All bead types showcased a
similar pH dependence with uptake being relatively low within
the pH range of 3 – 4 before sharply increasing in the range of
4 – 5. For higher pH values (5 – 6), the removal efficiency of
Zn2+ only slightly increased. The results suggested an optimum
pH of 6.
The increase in the removal efficiencies of Cu 2+ and Zn2+
at the higher pH values suggests that the adsorption of heavy
metal ions was regulated by the surface charge of the beads,
particularly from the protonation of non-crosslinked amine
groups.11 Protonation entails electrostatic repulsion of heavy
metal cations and unfavourable adsorption due to competitive
occupation of active sites by protons. 11, 19 The opposite effect
at high pH values accounts for more favourable adsorption.
This was not observed experimentally possibly due to reduced
sensitivity at higher pH levels. However, it must be noted that
the heavy metal ion solutions were unbuffered. Moreover, no
adjustments were performed during the agitation period.
Under identical conditions, all bead types exhibited a lower
affinity for Zn 2+. Previous studies have reported similar results
for Zn2+ and Cu 2+ for both single-ion and competitive batch
adsorption studies.27 The consensus is that the adsorption of
bivalent heavy metal ions onto chitosan is governed by the
Irving-William series, which describes the stability of bivalent
transition metal complexes, with Cu 2+ being the most stable. 28
Regarding bead type, higher SP protein content negatively
affected the removal efficiencies of Zn 2+ (Figure 4B). For
Cu2+, CH beads had a greater affinity. However, the difference
in uptake by CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads was small
(Figure 4A). The lack of a similar trend for Zn 2+ may be
attributed to a lower affinity for chelation with chitosan. In
general, the results suggested that SP protein was not suitable
as a functional agent for heavy metal ion adsorption. This was
consistent with the FT-IR spectra for CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ50 beads, which showed a decrease in functionalization at
higher SP protein content. The mean zeta potentials, under
neutral condition, for SP Protein and β-chitosan of 26.6 mV and
11.6 mV, respectively, offered a supplementary explanation
with higher cationic surface charge on SP protein being
supportive of greater resistance for the adsorption of Cu 2+ and
Zn2+. Notably, inherently higher cationic surface charge of SP
protein may enhance interactions with heavy metal ions that
exist as anionic coordination compounds (e.g. HCrO4− and
PdCl42-), which did not form part of the study. 6

Lastly, desorption studies were not performed. However,
CH and CH-SQ-25 beads maintained their mechanical integrity
after agitation and recovery. This demonstrated great potential,
except for slight vulnerability to acidic conditions as observed
with partial dissolution at pH 2 for the Cu 2+ studies. For CHSQ-50 beads, breakage was observed, but the extent was
difficult to assess due to significant variation in bead geometry.
Overall, the findings do not discredit SP protein as a filler copolymer, since it is directly derived from the same biomass as
β-chitosan

Kinetic studies
Kinetic studies offered insight into the mechanism behind
heavy metal ion uptake by CH-SQ-25 beads. The pseudo-firstorder (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) models were
used. These studies also investigated the suitability of a 24-hour
treatment period with regards to approaching equilibrium.
Figure 5A illustrates the time-course adsorption of Cu 2+ by
CH-SQ-25 beads from a 100-ppm solution. Equilibrium was
gradually approached over the 24-hour treatment period at an
adsorption capacity of 40.1 mg g -1. Notably, adsorption was
initially rapid as evidenced by the adsorption capacity after 3
hours being 32.8 mg g-1 or 83% of the equilibrium value.
The kinetics for Zn 2+ removal were also studied (Figure
5B). The equilibrium adsorption capacity was 8.3 mg g -1 after
24 hours of treatment. Remarkably, this was almost achieved
after only 6 hours, at a corresponding adsorption capacity of 8.1
mg g-1. The remainder of the initial treatment period was
equally rapid with 6.3 mg g -1, or 76% of the equilibrium value
having been adsorbed after 3 hours. Notably, the time-course
removal efficiency after 1 hour was 9% as opposed to 25%
from the pH studies, which suggests batch variation in the
synthesis of the same bead type or scale-up limitations. The
discrepancy was not noted for Cu 2+, which may indicate that
the lower affinity for Zn 2+ may have been a factor.
The parameters for the PFO and PSO kinetic models are
given on Table 1. Notably, the correlation coefficients, R 2, of
the PSO model were >0.9990 compared to >0.9649 for the PFO
model. Furthermore, the estimated equilibrium capacities from
the PSO model agreed with the experimentally obtained values
for both Cu2+ and Zn2+. With regards to the PFO model, the
experimental and theoretical values differed by more than 10%.
Plotting the PFO and PSO models with the obtained parameters
(Figure 5) visualized the more precise fit provided by the latter
model over the entire time domain. Therefore, the PSO model

was accepted to describe the adsorption of both Cu 2+ and Zn2+.
This suggested that the mechanism or rate-limiting step for
adsorption was chemisorption or complexation based on the
sharing or exchange of electrons between the heavy metal ions
and the adsorbent functional groups. 11, 21

adsorption over the low concentration range, resulting in the
collapse of the Freundlich isotherm. 29 Intuitively, the results
suggest that adsorption was limited to monolayer coverage
since the concentration range was inadequate to support
multilayer coverage. Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm best
described the adsorption of Zn 2+.
The suitability of the Langmuir isotherm for both Cu 2+ and
2+
Zn suggests that adsorption occurs via monolayer coverage of
homogeneous active sites, with negligible interactions among
the adsorbed heavy metal ions.11, 21
Based on the Langmuir isotherm, the CH-SQ-25 beads had
a maximum adsorption capacity of 70.2 and 24.0 mg g -1 for
Cu2+ and Zn2+, respectively (Table 1). These values confirmed
that the concentration range was inadequately low since the
studies only achieved adsorption capacities of 65.5 and 12.1 mg
g-1 for Cu2+ and Zn 2+, respectively. In fact, only 50% of the
maximum adsorption capacity for Zn 2+ was achieved.
The lower affinity of CH-SQ-25 beads for Zn 2+ was
supported by a lower maximum adsorption capacity compared
to the value for Cu 2+. This observation was consistent with
previous studies. The Langmuir constant, K L, provided
additional evidence of the lower affinity for Zn 2+ (Table 1). In
this regard, the much large K L value for Cu 2+ (0.0815 L mg-1),
compared to the value for Zn 2+ (0.0046 L mg -1), indicated a
much stronger binding affinity. Further elucidation of the lower
affinity of CH-SQ-25 beads for Zn 2+ was provided by the
Langmuir equilibrium parameters, R L, for which lower values
within the range of 0 – 1 indicate more favourable adsorption.
In this regard, the RL values for Zn2+ exceeded 0.4 over the
entire initial concentration range while those for Cu 2+ were
consistently lower than 0.2. Regardless, the adsorption of both
heavy metal ions was favourable. Notably, the lower affinity
for Zn2+ has previously been attributed to the higher stability of
Cu2+ complexes on the William-Irving series.

Equilibrium studies
The surface characteristics of CH-SQ-25 beads were elucidated
through equilibrium adsorption studies. The Freundlich and
Langmuir isotherms were employed to assess the distribution
of heavy metal ions between the beads and the solution at
equilibrium, with a 24-hour treatment period deemed suitable
from kinetic studies. Analysis focused on the saturation of
active sites due to excess heavy metal ions (i.e. high
concentrations), with the isotherms enabling the determination
of maximum adsorption capacities, q m, for Cu2+and Zn2+, for
comparison with previous work.
The equilibrium isotherm for Cu 2+ adsorption by CH-SQ25 beads was obtained for the concentration range of 50 – 250
ppm (Figure 6A). The onset of active site saturation was
observed. However, complete saturation was not achieved.
Moreover, the Langmuir isotherm offered a better description,
with a correlation coefficient, R 2, of 0.9938 compared to 0.9792
for the Freundlich isotherm (Table 1).
The effect of initial solution concentration on Zn 2+ uptake
by CH-SQ-25 beads was investigated under identical
conditions (Figure 6B). Notably, a high degree of linearity
suggested that the concentration range was too low to promote
saturation of active sites. Additionally, both the Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherms were in good accordance with the
experimental data, as indicated by correlation coefficients of
0.9980 and 0.9943, respectively (Table 1). This is believed to
have resulted from Henry’s law not being satisfied for Zn 2+

Conclusion

Lastly, CH-SQ-25 beads were competitive performance
compared to other chitosan-based beads reported in literature
(Table 2). Appreciable improvements for the adsorption of
Zn2+ and Cu2+ compared to other crosslinked hydrogel beads
were reported. Only conventional grafting yielded chitosanbased biosorbents possessing maximum adsorption capacities
that surpassed those of CH-SQ-25 beads. This highlighted the
effectiveness of IL treatment using [BMIM][OAc] as a highly
convenient functionalization method, which can compensate
for losses in adsorption capacity from crosslinking without
requiring the complexity associated with conventional grafting.

Biosorbent beads for heavy metal ion removal from wastewater
were successfully prepared from β-chitosan and SP protein, by
regeneration from [BMIM][OAc]. The mechanical, functional
and adsorptive properties of the hybrid biosorbents beads were
investigated to assess the contributions of SP protein.
Physical characterisation uncovered increased brittleness at
higher SP protein content in CH-SQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads.
Additionally, observable brittleness in CH beads suggested that
IL treatment in [BMIM][OAc] contributed to fragility. This
served to indicate a need to optimize the composition of the
beads and the preparation process, particularly the extrusion
procedures, which may have been more suitable for beads with
lower SP protein and more viscous casting solutions.
Furthermore, BET analysis should be utilized to investigate
whether greater non-uniformity in the internal networks of CHSQ-25 and CH-SQ-50 beads, resulting from SP protein content,
may have enhanced the surface area.
FT-IR analysis revealed that IL regeneration enhances the
functional group availability on chitosan. However, SP protein
was noted to diminish β-chitosan’s characteristic bands. Given
a relationship between FT-IR intensity and co-polymer dosage,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) may be used for the
analysis of specific functional groups, such as N-containing
groups. Alternatively, titration may be adopted for quantitative
analysis of active functional groups.
Adsorption studies highlighted less efficient heavy metal
ion removal at lower pH levels, with adsorption being optimal
at pH 5 and 6 for Cu 2+ and Zn2+, respectively. Concerning SP
protein, it was observed that higher contents corresponded to a
decrease in the removal efficiency of Cu 2+ and Zn2+.
Additionally, kinetic studies with CH-SQ-25 beads showed
rapid adsorption of Cu 2+ and Zn2+, following pseudo-secondorder kinetics, which is indicative of chemisorption.
Meanwhile, equilibrium studies based on the Langmuir
isotherm indicated that CH-SQ-25 beads have higher maximum
adsorption capacities for Cu 2+ and Zn2+ than similar hydrogel
beads reported in literature. Notably, further investigations
should be conducted using other heavy metals ions, particularly
anionic coordination compounds, to elucidate the influence of
the higher cationic surface charge of SP protein on the removal
of multifarious heavy metal ions.
The inclusion of SP protein did not improve the heavy metal
adsorption capability of chitosan. However, its inclusion as a
cost-reducing filler may be suggested considering IL
treatment’s potential for effective β-chitosan functionalization

Sustainability Metrics
The promotion of green chemistry in the synthesis of chitosanbased adsorbents by recasting from [BMIM][OAc] was
assessed. Atom economy and E-factor were employed. The
calculations focused solely on the CH bead type due to the
certainty of functional groups on β-chitosan with 92%
deacetylation and molecular weight of approximately 580 kDa.
Atom economy was evaluated in the context of crosslinking
with glutaraldehyde by imine bond formation, involving
condensation reactions. A conservative value of 91.61% was
obtained for the complete saturation of amine sites. However,
this scenario was unlikely due to the participation of free amine
sites in the adsorption of heavy metal ions. The actual atom
economy has been projected between 91.61 – 100%.
The E-factor considered the recyclability of [BMIM][OAc],
DMSO and absolute ethanol, as well as the full recovery of βchitosan in the CH beads. Losses solely considered the spent
glutaraldehyde solution. An optimal estimate of 0.105 was
noted for the retention of glutaraldehyde corresponding to
complete saturation of amine sites. However, acknowledging
the non-crosslinked amine sites, a conservative estimate was
obtained under the assumption of no crosslinking and the loss
of all glutaraldehyde solution. The actual E-factor has been
projected between 0.105 – 0.441.
The preparation of chitosan-based beads by IL treatment in
[BMIM][OAc] exhibited excellent atom economy and low Efactor. Furthermore, using SP protein as a co-polymer affords
additional merit by decreasing the environmental footprint and
overall cost of the biosorbents, given that β-chitosan is much
more costly due to the resource intensiveness of its synthesis.
