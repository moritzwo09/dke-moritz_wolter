The interstellar diatomic molecule, phosphorus mononitride (P≡N), is highly unstable under conditions
typical on Earth, and its utility for constructing elusive P–N multiply-bonded archetypes is essentially
uncharted. Herein, we show how Na(OCP) transfers a P atom to an electrophilic osmium nitride complex to form a terminally bound P≡N functionality. Quantum chemical calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy unveil a cumulenic [OsIV=N=P] electronic structure comprising orthogonal Os=N and
N=P π-bonding. The highly reduced P≡N ligand, formally [PN]2–, undergoes two-fold oxidation with elemental sulfur to form a trigonal planar [NPS2]2– group. On reaction with Ph3CCl, the P≡N ligand forms
a bent [NPCl]– motif coordinated to OsIII (S = ½). [3+2] cycloaddition of this radical species with Me3SiN3
forms an aromatic heterocyclic interpnictide, [PN4]–, that is inaccessible from the parent P≡N system.

Phosphorus mononitride (P≡N) was the first phosphoruscontaining molecule to be identified in the interstellar medium, following Turner, Bally, and Ziurys’s observations
of its rotational lines from the Orion KL Nebula in 1987.1,2
In our Solar System, P≡N has been detected in outgassing
vapor from a comet, suggesting the diatomic molecule
may have been a prebiotic source of phosphorus on the
early Earth.3 The first example of man-made P≡N was reported by Herzberg in 1933; an electric discharge through
a tube containing N2 and P4 generated the diatomic molecule in the gas phase, as authenticated from 24 rotational
bands.4 Given its vulnerable triple bond,5 studies of P≡N
in condensed phase are far from trivial. Examples involve
thermal decomposition of P3N5 at 800–900 °C followed
by isolation in solid Kr,6 dehalogenation of [N3P3Cl6] with
Ag at 1300 K followed by isolation in solid Ar,5 or photolysis of [{1,2-C6H4O2}P(N3)] in solid Ar.7 Even in cryogenic
noble gas matrices, P≡N is unstable when the temperature
rises above 10 K, which leads to oligomerization into discrete [P3N3] species,5,8,9 followed by the onset of higher
polymerization products. To date, the smallest [PxNy]
molecule isolated under ambient conditions is Klapötke’s
azido-phosphazene, [P3(µ-N)3(N3)6];10 a smaller system
such as P(N3)3 decomposes rapidly in solution.11
An attractive strategy for studying P≡N is to form an adduct that stabilizes this reactive functionality. Thus, in
1988, Niecke and co-workers reported aryl cations [Ar–
N≡P]+ (Chart 1, A),12,13 which display P≡N bond distances
(1.475(8)–1.493(12) Å) similar to free, gaseous P≡N
(1.49086(2) Å).14 Later, research teams led by Bertrand,15
Cummins,16 and Schulz17 demonstrated how P≡N could be
sandwiched between carbenes (B), anthracene (C), or cyclobutadienes (D). The long P–N bonds (>1.69 Å) in these
neutral species conform more closely to a description as

P–N single-bonds than P≡N triple bonds. Given that P≡N
is valence-shell isoelectronic to N2, the heterodiatomic
molecule could serve as a π-backbonding ligand in a transition metal complex. Initial studies by Cummins and coworkers revealed low stability of the transient complex
[{Ar[tBu]N}3V–N≡P], which oligomerizes to diphosphene
and cyclo-triphosphane derivatives (Ar = 3,5-Me2C6H3).18
In 2020, Smith and co-workers isolated the first transition metal P≡N complexes by reductively coupling FeIV nitride and MoVI phosphide precursors to afford a heterobimetallic system, [Mo–PN–Fe]. Subsequent conversion of
this complex with tBuNC yielded a P≡N complex anion,
[{N(CH2CH2NSiMe3)3}Mo–P≡N]– (E) with an iron-isonitrile complex as counter ion; in the solid state, E converts
photolytically to its N-bound linkage isomer.19 More recently, Cummins and co-workers thermolyzed an anthracene-scaffolded azidophosphine, [{C14H10}P(N3)], to form
anthracene, N2, and P≡N; the heterodiatomic molecule
was intercepted by a FeII complex (F).20

Scheme 1. Conversion of (Bu4N)[Os(N)Cl4] to nitride precursors 1 and 2. Treatment of 2 with DMAP and Na(OCP) yields
P≡N complex 3. Oxidation of 3 with S8 and Ph3CCl generates [NPS2]2– complex 4 and [NPCl]– complex 5, respectively. Complex
5 reacts with Me3SiN3 to form [PN4]– complex 6, which decomposes thermally to 3 and N2 complex 7.

The advanced synthetic protocols devised for making P≡N
complexes have limited the utility of this functionality for
constructing synthetically demanding phosphorus-nitrogen multiple bonded architectures by redox, atom transfer, or cycloaddition strategies. The only reported reactions of a P≡N ligand involve complex E, which can be
metallated by a RhI center or silylated by Me3SiCl.19 These
conversions bear a striking resemblance to metallation
and silylation of transition metal dinitrogen complexes,21
which calls into question whether N≡N and P≡N ligands
display essentially identical reactivity. Given the elusive
nature and uncharted reactivity of P≡N complexes, we
sought alternative synthetic methodology toward this
functionality and its chemistry. Herein, we describe how
sodium phosphaethynolate delivers a P atom to an electrophilic osmium nitride complex to form a neutral [Os–
N≡P] ↔ [Os=N=P] motif. We probe its electronic structure by isotopic labeling, multinuclear NMR, vibrational
spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES) spectroscopy, and theoretical studies. We also
report how the P≡N ligand can be elaborated into unique
inorganic motifs such as a trigonal planar [NPS2]2– and
bent a [NPCl]– group. The P≡N ligand does not react directly with azides to form an aromatic heterocycle, [PN4]–
, but is activated toward such [3+2] cycloaddition when
subjected to umpolung.

Results and Discussion
P-Atom Transfer from Na(OCP) to an Osmium Nitride to Form a P≡N Complex (3). In spite of the high
electronegativity of nitrogen (3.04, Pauling scale), highvalent, late transition metal nitride complexes possess
such low d-orbital energies that their M≡N bonds may become polarized toward the metal center rather than the
nitride ligand.22 Given that group 8 nitrides react with elemental sulfur to form thionitrosyl complexes, [M–

N≡S],23-25 and considering the isoelectronic relationship
between S and P–, we inquired whether a P≡N ligand
could be assembled from a terminal osmium nitride functionality and a phosphorus atom transfer reagent such as
Na(OCP).26,27 To this end, we treated nitride complex
(Bu4N)[Os(N)Cl4] with salicylaldimine ligand Na[salNdipp] in THF to form [(salNdipp)2(Cl)Os≡N] (1,
Scheme 1, sal = salicylidene, dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl). Further conversion of 1 with AgOTf afforded triflate complex [(salNdipp)2(OTf)Os≡N] (2) as orange crystals in 95% isolated yield after removal of AgCl.
Treatment of 2 with Na(OCP) · 2.5 dioxane in THF led to
several strong IR absorptions (1897–2202 cm–1, suggesting coordinated CO ligand) as well as two 31P NMR singlets (233, 220 ppm). To obtain a cleaner conversion, we
first blocked one coordination site on the osmium center
by treating 2 with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and
subsequently with Na(OCP) · 2.5 dioxane in THF. This led
to effervescence over 5 minutes and a color change from
light to dark orange. Very dark (almost black) crystals of
[(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NP)] (3) were isolated in 94%
yield after removal of NaOTf. X-ray crystallography revealed salNdipp– ligands arranged with the imine nitrogen atoms in a trans-configuration, the phenolate oxygen
atoms cis, and DMAP coordinated cis to the P≡N ligand
(Figure 1A). The phosphorus mononitride ligand displays linear coordination through nitrogen and a short
P≡N bond, 1.536(5) Å, (elongated 3.0% relative to free
P≡N).14 Remarkably, the Os–NP bond, 1.846(5) Å, is
shorter than any Os–N2 bond in a dinitrogen complex
(shortest: 1.896(6) Å).28 As a direct comparison to 3, we
independently synthesized the N2 analog, [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(N2)] (7), vide infra. The Os–N2 bond
in 7, 1.903(6) Å, is substantially longer than the Os–NP
bond in 3, which suggests P≡N to be a stronger π-acid
than its homoatomic analog.

Spectroscopic Characterization of 3. To glean more
information about the electronic structure of 3, we turned
to spectroscopic methods. 31P NMR spectroscopy revealed a singlet at 249 ppm, evincing a shielded phosphorus nucleus compared to P≡N complexes E (312 ppm) and
F (272 ppm) in Chart 1. An isotopically labelled sample
of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(15NP)] (3-15N), displayed a 15N
NMR doublet at 396 ppm (1JNP = 62 Hz, Figures 1B–1C).
The nitrogen nucleus is more shielded than its counterparts in E (445 ppm) and F (450 ppm). Turning to IR
spectroscopy, 3 and 3-15N display P≡N stretching frequencies at 1258 and 1221 cm–1, respectively (Figure 1D).
These vibrations are redshifted relative to free P≡N (1323
cm–1), indicating weakened P≡N bonding upon complexation.6,29 Within the harmonic oscillator approximation,
a 31P14N/31P15N isotopic system would shift from 1258 to
1229 cm–1 upon labeling, whereas an 190Os14N/190Os15N
system would shift as low as 1218 cm–1; clearly, 3/3-15N
fall in between these limiting cases. For comparison,
complex F displays less redshifted stretching vibrations
(1271/1238 cm–1 for 14N/15N). Overall, the lower IR
stretching mode and the more shielded 31P and 15N nuclei
suggest that the P≡N ligand in 3 engages in more extensive π-backbonding with the π-basic OsII center, as compared to previously reported MoII and FeII complexes E
and F. Finally, UV-vis spectroscopy revealed intense absorptions at 258, 318, 348, and 401 nm (ε = 45000,
26000, 27000, and 18000 M–1 cm–1, respectively), indicative of charge-transfer transitions between the Os center
and the P≡N ligand (Figure 1E).
Electronic Structure of 3. We further studied the electronic structure of 3 by density functional theory (DFT),
using PBE0/def2-TZVP(-f) for geometry optimizations
and TPSSh/def2-TZVP for single-point calculations. In
theory, 3 can be described by three limiting resonance
contributors, namely [OsII] singly bonded to a neutral
[P≡N] ligand, [OsIV] doubly bonded to a dianionic [P=N]2–
ligand, or [OsVI] triply bonded to a tetraanionic [P–N]4–
ligand. Upon reaction with a hypothetical electrophile,
these scenarios could lead to single (E1), twofold (E2), or

threefold (E3) functionalization of the P≡N ligand (Figure 2A). In a molecular orbital depiction, an [OsNP]
fragment possesses 5dxz, 5dyz, 2px, 2py, 3px, and 3py atomic
orbitals aligned for π-bonding (Figure 2B), yielding linear combinations that are in-phase bonding (π), nonbonding with a nodal plane at N (πnb), and out-of-phase
antibonding (π*). Calculated molecular orbitals for 3
(Figure 2C) unambiguously show the two π-systems corresponding to the in-phase bonding π set; however, the
unsymmetrical ligand field around osmium concentrates
HOMO–23 at N–P, whereas HOMO–20 is Os–N centered. These localized and orthogonal N=P and Os=N πbonds suggest that 3 possesses a dominant cumulenic
character, [Os=N=P]; strong π-backdonation from osmium confers an [N=P]2– character on the diatomic ligand. Looking to higher energy, the πnb orbitals (HOMO–
2, HOMO) have large amplitudes on Os and P, with a
nodal plane on the central N atom. Interpreted as Lewis
structures, the πnb orbitals represent two d-electrons on
Os and one lone pair on P. Concomitant with this notion,
electrophilic Fukui functions display large amplitudes on
Os and P (SI, Figure S9.2.1), pointing out likely loci of
electrophilic functionalization (vide infra). Finally, the
out-of-phase π* set is, as expected, energetically low-lying
virtual orbitals (LUMO+2 and LUMO+3).
In harmony with the topology of the π and πnb molecular
orbitals, Mayer bond orders (Figure 2D) also indicate
multiple bond character for both the N–P bond (2.22) and
the Os–N bond (1.21), suggesting a dominant [Os=N=P]
Lewis structure. Topological analysis using quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) reveals moderate ellipticity (ε = 0.100) for the Os=N bond, supporting a nonsymmetric electron distribution within this π-bond,
whereas the N=P bond is closer to cylindrical symmetry (ε
= 0.010). When comparing the electronic structure of 3
to the few reported P≡N systems (Chart 1), both E and F
display very marginal π-backbonding and are best represented by P≡N triple bonds.19,20 In line with this bonding
scheme, Smith showcased how silylation and metallation
led to linear [Mo–P≡N–X] motifs (X = SiMe3, RhI), indicating E1 reactivity in Figure 2A. Conforming more

closely to an [Os=N=P] description, 3 could conceivably
undergo twofold electrophilic functionalization in line
with E2 reactivity.
Oxidation of 3 by Sulfur to Form an [NPS2]2– Ligand. To probe the reactivity of the osmium-coordinated
P≡N ligand, we treated 3 with elemental sulfur. Considering Figure 2A, this could generate unprecedented ternary ions such as [NPS2]2– or [NPS3]4– or a heavy-atom
analog of nitrous oxide, NPS.30 When using ¼ eq. S8, diamagnetic [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPS2)] (4) formed in
73% yield as dark orange crystals. Desulfurization with
PPh3 regenerated 3 along with Ph3PS. X-ray crystallography revealed an osmium center bound to a trigonal planar nitridodisulfidophosphate(V) ligand, [NPS2]2–, coordinated linearly through N (Figure 3A). The planar PV
center (angle sum 359.8°) contrasts with the pyramidalized PIII center (311.9°) in the known complex,
[{Ar[tBu]N}3V–{NPS2(C10H6)}], formed by trapping transient [{Ar[tBu]N}3VIII–N≡P] with 1,8-naphthalenediyl disulfide (C10H6)S2.18 The Os–N, P–N, and P–S bond distances in 4 indicate π-delocalization in the [OsNPS2] fragment, which is corroborated by Mayer bond orders (1.30–
1.67). The formation of 4 upon E2-type reactivity (Figure
2A) demonstrates the striking contrast in reactivity of 3
compared to the few P≡N complexes reported to date.
Spectroscopically, 4 displays a 31P NMR singlet at a lower
chemical shift than 3 (233 ppm). A 1H-15N HMBC experiment revealed eight long-range correlations (4JHN, 6JHN,
7JHN) to the [NPS2]2– ligand, unequivocally identifying a
low-intensity and strongly deshielded 15N doublet at 955
ppm (1JNP = 51 Hz, Figure 3A).
Chlorination of 3 to Form an [NPCl]– Ligand. To
test for radical reactivity, we treated 3 with trityl chloride.
This generated Gomberg’s dimer (observed by 1H NMR)

and a mono-chlorinated OsIII product [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPCl)] (5), isolated as dark orange
crystals in 97% yield. Excess trityl chloride did not perturb the product distribution. The [NPCl]– ligand is the
isoelectronic phosphorus analog of the rare main group
terminal nitride, thiazyl chloride, [NSCl].31 X-ray crystallography revealed linear Os–N–P and bent N–P–Cl geometries, in line with a lone pair on phosphorus (Figure
3B). Interestingly, 5 possesses one of the longest structurally characterized P–Cl bonds (top 1%), suggesting a
labile halogen substituent. Given its radical nature, 5 displays paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR resonances from
–22 to +23 ppm (FWHM 5–1100 Hz). Magnetization
measurements (Figure 3B) revealed an effective magnetic moment (µeff = 1.64 µB, 300 K) in accord with the
spin-only value for an effective S = ½ system. The magnetic moment remains practically constant until 20 K but
increases slightly at the lowest temperature to reach 1.74
µB at 3 K, suggesting the presence of weak ferromagnetic
interactions between the constituent molecules. All magnetic field and low-temperature magnetization data collapse on a single curve when plotted against the reduced
variable µ0HT–1, which is well described by an effective S
= 1/2 Brillouin function with g = 1.91(5) (Figure 3B, inset). The significant reduction of g from 2.0 suggests a
dominant metallo-radical character of 5. In accord, computed Löwdin spin densities (SI, Figure S9.2.2) indicate an OsIII-centered radical with minor spin delocalization onto the nitrogen of [NPCl]–.
[3+2] Cycloaddition of 5 with Azide. In spite of the
hypothetical triple bond reactivity of a P≡N ligand, 3 does
not undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with azides to form a
[PN4]– heterocycle. However, the oxidized species, 5, offers a P≡N fragment subjected to umpolung, and upon

reaction with Me3SiN3, a thermally sensitive tetrazaphospholide OsIII complex, [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(η1-N4P)]
(6), forms as orange crystals in 55% yield. Aromatic pnictogen rings, and nitrogen-rich interpnictides in particular, are challenging constructs. Baudler and co-workers
reported [P5]– in 1987,32 but it was not until 2016 and
2017, that Velian and Cummins isolated the first unsubstituted [P2N3]– heterocycle,33 and Lu and co-workers isolated [N5]–, respectively.34,35 All other unsubstituted
[PnNn–5]– rings have remained unknown.36,37 X-ray crystallography identified 6 as a single linkage isomer with a
planar [PN4]– ring coordinated through a nitrogen adjacent to phosphorus (Figure 3C). The N–N bonds are
alike within 0.02 Å, while the two P–N bonds differ by almost 0.1 Å. Bond angles around the nitrogen atoms lie
fairly close to the value for a regular pentagon, whereas
the P–N bonds are practically orthogonal. The Os–N4P
bond distance is alike the other Os–Nimine/DMAP bonds of 6,
indicating coordination through a dative σ-bond. Computational analysis revealed π-delocalization within the
[PN4]– ring (Figure 3C) and Mayer bond orders spanning 1.12–1.49, in line with an aromatic character, as well
as an OsIII-centered radical (SI, Figure S9.2.3). Being
paramagnetic, 6 displays broad 1H NMR resonances from
–30 to +19 ppm (FWHM 10–1500 Hz) and a magnetic
moment of 1.85 µB in solution (Evans’ method, THF, 298
K). Thermal decomposition of 6 (room temperature) generates an 1:1 mixture of 3 and dinitrogen complex [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(N2)] (7), along with a white solid, attributable to binary phosphorus(V) nitrogen species.38
The N2 complex could be separated after selectively converting 3 into 4 with S8. The metastable nature of 6 is also
manifested in its reduction chemistry; treatment with KC8

does not produce a hypothetical salt such as “[K][(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(η1-N4P)]“, but instead leads to a clean
retro [3+2] cycloaddition, forming 3 and KN3 (identified
by 1H/31P NMR and IR data, υN3– = 2012 cm–1).
X-ray Spectroscopic Studies. To gain element-specific information about the electronic structure of 2, 3, 4,
and 5, we turned to X-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES) spectroscopy. For the phosphorus K-edge (Figure 4A), the dipole selection rule Δl = ±1 allows excitations from filled core 1s levels to vacant valence orbitals
having 3p character. Complexes 3, 4, and 5 display drastic spectral differences, which are brought about by a subtle interplay between the oxidation state of phosphorus,
covalent orbital interactions with neighboring atoms, and
the local geometry about the phosphorus atom.39 These
spectral features directly map the profound differences in
electronic structure for the P≡N, [NPS2]2–, and [NPCl]–
ligands. We also recorded osmium L2,3 XANES to probe
directly the electronic configuration of the 5d orbitals of
osmium (Figure 4B). The spectra show strong resonances (white lines) at the absorption edges, corresponding to dipole-allowed 2p1/2, 3/2→ 5d3/2, 5/2 transitions. Of
the series of compounds, 2 features the highest white line
photon energies, which are slightly higher than for both 3
and 4. The lowest photon energies are observed for 5
commensurate with the lower, formal oxidation state assignment. In addition, the white line integrals are a sensitive measure of the number of electron holes in the Os
5d states (Figure 4C), as previously reported.40,41 By applying the spin-orbit sum rules for p→d transitions,42 the
number of electrons populating the 5d5/2 and 5d3/2
sublevels (ne) were quantitatively determined. This, in

congruence with the energy positions of the white lines,
confirms the highest oxidation state in 2 (ne = 3.73; formally OsVI), a common, intermediate oxidation state in 3
and 4 (ne = 4.17 and 4.13; formally OsIV), and the lowest
oxidation state in 5 (ne = 4.40; formally OsIII). Bear in
mind that the present analysis does not provide the true
oxidation state since any contributions arising from transitions to the 6s and 6p states are neglected. The spectroscopic findings can be well understood in terms of ligandcentered oxidations of a [PN]2– moiety, forming closedshell motifs, [NPS2]2–, and [NPCl]–, engaged in cumulenic
bonding with osmium. Remarkably, as evidenced from
XANES spectroscopy, oxidation of 3 to 4 leaves the oxidation state of osmium invariant, whereas oxidation of 3
to 5 leads to a lower oxidation state of osmium.

Conclusions
The interstellar diatomic molecule, phosphorus mononitride (P≡N), offers singular access to phosphorus-nitrogen multiple bonded constructs, serving as exemplars in
structure, bonding, and reactivity. Only a few synthetic
strategies to stabilize P≡N have been reported. We have
demonstrated how P-atom transfer from Na(OCP) to an
osmium nitride assembles a terminally bound P≡N ligand,
(3). Theoretical modeling coupled with XANES spectroscopy revealed a highly reduced P≡N functionality, formally [PN]2–, and a cumulenic [OsIV=N=P] electronic
structure with orthogonal Os=N and N=P π-bonding. The
P≡N ligand, being both coordinatively stabilized and reductively activated by the π-basic osmium scaffold, undergoes oxidative conversions into unique binary and ternary π-bonded motifs, including trigonal planar [NPS2]2–
(4), bent [NPCl]– (5), and cyclic [PN4]– (6); we are presently extending this strategy to other coordinated intermediates that cannot be accessed through classic synthetic chemistry.

Methods
All synthetic operations were performed in Vigor glove boxes under a purified atmosphere of N2 (O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm). Hexane
and toluene were initially purified with an MBraun SPS system. Tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether were initially stored over sodium
benzophenone ketyl diradical, distilled by trap-to-trap transfer in
vacuo, and degassed by freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Benzene-d6 and
THF-d8 were stored over a potassium mirror overnight, sublimed/distilled by trap-to-trap transfer in vacuo, and degassed by
freeze-pump-thaw cycles. The water content of the solvents was further reduced by storage over 4 Å molecular sieves. Celite and 4 Å
molecular sieves were activated in vacuo overnight at 175 °C.
Synthesis of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(15NP)] (3-15N)
A solution of H(salNdipp) (116.2 mg, 0.413 mmol) in 3 ml THF
was added over 5 minutes to a suspension of NaH (14.0 mg, 0.583
mmol, 1.4 eq) in 1 ml THF. Vigorous effervescence ensued (H2, several minutes). The suspension was left to stir over 90 minutes, resulting in a slight darkening of the yellow color. Residual NaH was
removed by filtration through celite, and the filtrate was transferred
to a vial containing (Bu4N)[Os(15N)Cl4] (121.0 mg, 0.205 mmol) and
left to stir overnight, resulting in a slow color change from dark purple to orange. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and
the residue was redissolved in a mixture of Et2O and toluene (15 ml,
1:2, Et2O:tol), filtered through celite (removing (Bu4N)Cl and NaCl)
and washed through the filter with 2×2 ml toluene. The solvent was
removed under reduced pressure, leaving [(salNdipp)2(Cl)Os15N] (115N) as an orange solid. The solid was redissolved in 5 ml THF, and
a solution of AgOTf (53.8 mg, 0.209 mmol) in 3 ml toluene was
added under vigorous stirring. After 30 minutes, the suspension was
filtered through celite (removing AgCl), and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure, leaving [(salNdipp)2(OTf)Os15N] (215N) as an orange crystalline material. The resulting solid and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, 25.0 mg, 0.205 mmol) were dissolved in 15 ml toluene, and the reaction mixture was left to stir overnight, resulting in an orange suspension. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure. To the solid, Na(OCP) · 2.5 dioxane (68.9
mg, 0.228 mmol, 1.1 eq) in 5 ml THF was added, resulting in evolution of gas (CO, for several minutes) and a color change from light
orange to very dark orange. After 30 minutes, the reaction mixture
was filtered through celite, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The solid was then redissolved in a minimal amount
of toluene (ca. 30 ml), and Al2O3 (pH 7, 2.0 g) was added to adsorb
NaOTf (this byproduct forms a THF adduct with similar solubility to
3). The mixture was stirred for 2 hours, the solution was filtered
through celite, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.
The solid residue was redissolved in minimal THF (ca. 5 ml) and diluted with hexane (ca. 50 ml), until the solution started to turn
cloudy. The solution was then swirled and left at –35 °C overnight
to grow dark orange crystals of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(15NP)] (315N). The mother liquor was removed by decanting, and the very
dark orange crystals were washed with cold hexane 3×2 ml and dried
under reduced pressure. Yield of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(15NP)] (315N): 177.6 mg, 0.193 mmol, 94.1% based on (Bu4N)[Os(15N)Cl4].

58.86%, H: 5.91%, N: 7.61%.
Synthesis of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPS2)] (4)
[(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NP)] (3, 25.0 mg, 27.2 µmol) and S8 (1.74
mg, 54.3 µmol of S, 2.0 eq.)* were dissolved in 7.5 ml toluene, resulting in a slow color change from dark orange to dark green. The reaction mixture was cooled to –35 °C overnight, resulting in crystallization of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPS2)] (4) as dark orange crystals.
The mother liquor was removed by decanting, and the dark orange
crystals were washed with cold toluene (3×1 ml) and dried under reduced pressure. Yield of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPS2)] (4), 19.5
mg, 19.9 µmol 72.9% based on 3. Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography separated from the reaction mixture of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPS2)] (4). 31P{1H} NMR, 243 MHz, THF-d8, δ

NMR, 61 MHz, THF-d8, δ (ppm): 954.53 (d, 1JNP = 50.5 Hz). Elemental analysis, calculated for C45H54N5O2OsPS2: C: 55.02%, H:
5.54%, N: 7.13%; found: C: 54.74%, H: 5.59%, N: 7.05%.
* Note: Sulfur was weighed precisely by making a stock solution
of 17.4 mg S8 in 10 ml toluene and taking out a 1 ml aliquot.
Synthesis of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPCl)] (5)
[(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NP)] (3, 100.0 mg, 0.109 mmol) and
Ph3CCl (40.5 mg, 0.145 mmol, 1.3 eq.) were dissolved in 5 ml THF,
and the reaction mixture was left for 3 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the dark orange residue was redissolved in a minimum amount of THF (3 ml), diluted with hexane
(15 ml), cooled to –35 °C, and left to crystallize overnight. The
mother liquor was removed by decanting, and the dark orange crystals of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPCl)] (5) were washed with cold
hexane (3×2 ml), and dried under reduced pressure. Yield of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPCl)] (5): 100.7 mg, 0.106 mmol, 97.0% based
on 3. Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography separated from a
THF solution of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPCl)] (5), with hexane/toluene as sorbent at –35 °C. Magnetic moment, µeff (Evans’
method, THF-d8, 298 K): 1.83 µB. Elemental analysis, calculated
for C45H54ClN5O2OsP: C: 56.68%, H: 5.71%, N: 7.34%; found: C:
56.59%, H: 5.74%, N: 7.31%.
Synthesis of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(η1-N4P)] (6)
[(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(NPCl)] (5, 25.0 mg, 26.2 µmol) and
Me3SiN3 (3.44 mg, 29.8 µmol, 1.15 eq) were dissolved in 1.5 ml THF,
and the reaction mixture was left for 1 hour. The solution was diluted
with hexane (ca. 10 ml) to precipitate out dark orange crystals of
[(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(η1-N4P)] (6), the mixture was cooled to –35
°C for 30 minutes and washed with 3×1 ml hexane. Yield of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(η1-N4P)] (6), 13.9 mg, 14.5 µmol, 55.2% based on
5. Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography separated from a Et2O
solution of [(salNdipp)2(DMAP)Os(η1-N4P)] (6), with toluene as
sorbent at –35 °C. Magnetic moment, µeff (Evans’ method, THFd8, 298 K): 1.85 µB.
Elemental analysis, calculated for
C45H54N8O2OsP: C: 56.29%, H: 5.67, N: 11.67; found: C: 53.68%, H:
5.83%, N: 11.45%; we attribute the sub-optimal elemental analysis to
thermal decomposition of 6 during shipping.
Note: other azide sources also convert 5 to 6, but due to the low
stability of the product, these methods do not allow a pure product
to be isolated. [1] When using (Bu4N)(N3) in C6D6, 6 forms cleanly
within 5 minutes, but the (Bu4N)Cl byproduct has a similar solubility to 6; attempts at removing (Bu4N)Cl with alumina resulted in
full decomposition of 6. [2] When using NaN3 in THF or dioxane,
the formation of 6 is so slow that its thermal decomposition to 3 and
N2 complex 7 prevents isolation of a pure product. [3] When using
NaN3 with LiCl as phase-transfer catalyst in THF, the conversion
rate is variable, and lithium ion remains in the sample, as verified
from 7Li NMR.
