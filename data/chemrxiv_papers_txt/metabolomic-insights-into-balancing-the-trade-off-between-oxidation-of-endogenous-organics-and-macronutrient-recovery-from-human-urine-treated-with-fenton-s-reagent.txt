The high concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds in human urine present both
challenges and opportunities for its treatment using advanced oxidation processes. This study
evaluates Fenton oxidation for selectively degrading endogenoous organic metabolites in urine
while preserving critical nutrients such as urea. Using targeted metabolomics, over 200 organic
metabolites were identified in acidified urine, with creatinine, citric acid, hippuric acid, and
methylhistidine comprising half of the total organic metabolite load (ΣOMs = 3.23 g L⁻¹). Under
optimised conditions (pH 4.0, 1:1 Fe²⁺: H₂O₂ molar ratio), 59% of ΣOMs were degraded in
unconcentrated urine treated with 1 g H₂O₂ L⁻¹. Increasing the H2O2 dose in unconcentrated
urine, or treating concentrated urine obtained through evaporative water removal, resulted in
higher ΣOMs degradation but also increased urea oxidation, highlighting a trade-off between
efficient COD removal and nutrient recovery. COD removal was 38% at pH 4.0 and 27% at pH
6.0, suggesting that Fenton oxidation could be applied to H₂O₂ stabilised urine without strict pH
adjustment. Real urine differed significantly from synthetic urine, requiring five times more Fe²⁺
catalyst for complete H₂O₂ activation and reaching equilibrium within five minutes compared to
two hours in synthetic urine. Organic compounds in urine scavenged Fe³⁺, forming iron-organic
complexes that disrupted Fe²⁺ regeneration and contributed to iron precipitation at higher pH
values. These findings demonstrate that Fenton oxidation can be optimised to achieve selective
degradation of undesirable organics while preserving plant-essential nutrients in urine
collected within resource-oriented sanitation systems.

Advanced oxidation processes use highly reactive radical species to facilitate the non-selective
oxidation and breakdown of organic and inorganic compounds (Eq. 1.). One of the most reactive
free radicals, the hydroxyl radical (E° = 2.73 V), can be generated by activating hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) with ozone, UV light, ultrasound, and transition metals (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003). H 2O2
activation with iron salts, colloquially known as Fenton oxidation, consists of a sequence of
reactions (Eq. 2 -8) (Barb et al., 1949). The chain reaction begins when ferrous ions (Fe 2+) catalyse
the formation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in an acidic medium (Eq. 2). The reaction chain
regenerates Fe2+ as the ferric (Fe3+) ions produced in Eq. 2 further react with H2O2 (Eq. 3).

Fenton oxidation has been widely studied as a treatment method for degrading organic pollutants
in water and wastewater (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2012). The mechanism by which hydroxyl
radicals interact with organic compounds is well understood, occurring primarily by abstraction
of hydrogen from C–H, N–H, or O–H bonds, or by addition to C=C double bonds and aromatic rings
(Buxton et al., 1988; von Sonntag et al., 1997). Comprehensive reviews on Fenton chemistry in
various matrices can be found in the works of Pignatello et al. (2006), (Deng and Englehardt,
2006) and (Bautista et al., 2008). Compared to other advanced oxidation processes, Fenton
oxidation offers practical advantages, as it does not require complicated equipment or additional
energy inputs, such as those needed for ozone-, UV-, or ultrasound-based activation of H 2O2.
However, the classical Fenton chain reaction has limitations, including a narrow optimal pH range
(2-4), safety concerns regarding the handling, transport and storage of corrosive reagents, such
as H2O2, concentrated acids, and iron catalyst, and the formation of iron sludge, which requires
proper disposal (Zhang et al., 2019).

Human urine presents a unique matrix for studying Fenton chemistry due to several key factors.
First, compared to domestic wastewater, human urine is highly concentrated in both organic and
inorganic compounds, with a chemical oxygen demand typically ranging from 5 to 10 g O2 L-1
(Putnam, 1971). These compounds include salts like sodium chloride, endogenous metabolites
such as urea, uric acid and creatinine, as well as exogenous substances like pharmaceutical drug
residues (Simha et al., 2024). Second, the human urine metabolome encompasses a diverse range
of organic molecules, including amino acids, phospholipids, amines, organic acids, acylcarnitines,
sphingomyelins and nucleotides, that contribute to its complex chemical profile (Bouatra et al.,
2013). Third, studies investigating Fenton chemistry in real urine are scarce, as most existing
research has been conducted in synthetic urine (Gonzaga et al., 2021; Miao et al., 2023). Fourth,
urine naturally contains trace amounts of transition metals, which can activate H2O2 (Bouatra et
al., 2013). Lastly, in the emerging field of resource-oriented sanitation, there is growing
recognition that the presence of endogenous organic metabolites in human urine can significantly
impact the performance and efficiency of unit operations used to recover resources. For instance,
organic compounds in urine can cause fouling in filtration processes (Guizani et al., 2022), alter

adsorption dynamics of pollutants (Heusser et al., 2024), and influence the purity and yield of
precipitated minerals (Simbeye et al., 2023). Many treatment technologies also require collected
urine to be acidified, as it prevents mineral precipitation, inhibits reactions that lead to nitrogen
loss, and inactivates pathogens (Hellström et al., 1999). This pre-acidification is advantageous for
Fenton processes, which operate most effectively within a pH range of 2–4 (Pignatello et al.,
2006). Moreover, if source-separated urine is stabilised with H2O2 to inhibit urease activity (Arve
and Popat, 2021), any residual H2O2 can subsequently be activated by dosing Fe²⁺, providing dual
functionality that strengthens the case for applying Fenton oxidation for treating urine.

Since the urine matrix is complex, it is important to establish key operating parameters for Fenton
oxidation, including the optimum H₂O₂ dose, the H₂O₂ to Fe²⁺ ratio, and pH. In addition, sourceseparated urine is typically concentrated to remove water and reduce transport costs (Chipako
and Randall, 2020). It is therefore important to understand how the urine mass concentration
factor (CF) affects the Fenton process, as both the composition and concentration of organic
compounds can significantly impact the optimal pH range for effective treatment (Zhang et al.,
2019). Additionally, Fenton oxidation can be inhibited by certain inorganic ions, such as sulphate,
phosphate, bromide, and chloride (Pignatello et al., 2006). This inhibition may result from
hydroxyl radical scavenging or iron precipitation, particularly in the presence of phosphate,
leading to the formation of iron(III) phosphate or vivianite (Simbeye et al., 2023), which in turn
influences the optimal doses of H₂O₂ and Fe²⁺. Another key consideration is the reactivity of •OH
with chloride (k=4.3×109 M−1s−1) and urea (k = 7.9×105 M−1s−1) (Dorfman and Adams, 1973). The
oxidation of chloride can lead to the formation of chlorinated by-products, such as chlorate,
perchlorate, organic and inorganic chloramines (Clark et al., 2021), whereas the oxidation of urea
can result in nitrogen loss, reducing the value of fertiliser products derived from treated urine.

The overall aim of this study was to investigate Fenton oxidation as a targeted treatment process
for the selective oxidation of organic metabolites in human urine, with a focus on minimising the
oxidation of chloride and urea. Specific objects were to (i) evaluate the effect of different
operating parameters (ratio of H2O2:Fe2+, pH, concentration factor, H2O2 dose) and (ii) determine
the fate of urea, total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), chloride, COD, and >250 endogenous organic
metabolites in urine treated using Fenton’s reagent. Overall, this study provides valuable insights
into both the feasibility and challenges of integrating advanced oxidation processes in resourceoriented sanitation systems aimed at recycling human urine.

Fresh urine was collected throughout the day in sterile bottles from male and female donors, aged
25-60 years old. At the end of each day, the donations were pooled into a 25-litre plastic container
and mixed with 1.5 g L-1 of a 95 % sulfuric acid solution to lower the pH to ≤ 3.0 and prevent urea
hydrolysis (Simha et al., 2023). Portions of the acidified urine were concentrated by evaporation
at 40 °C, reducing its mass by 80% or 90% to achieve mass concentration factors (CF) of 5 and
10, respectively. Unconcentrated acidified urine was designated as CF1. Detailed urine
compositions are provided in Error! Reference source not found. of the Supplementary

Four sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of key operating parameters on
Fenton oxidation of urine: the H₂O₂ to Fe²⁺ ratio, pH, H₂O₂ dose, urine concentration factor, and
initial chloride concentration. Experimental conditions, including chemical dose, specific ratios,
pH levels, and concentration factors, are detailed in Table 1. For each experiment, 75 mL of
acidified urine was placed in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks kept on a magnetic stirrer. Hydrogen
peroxide (50% H2O2, w/w in water) and iron (II) sulphate heptahydrate (FeSO₄·7H₂O) from a
prepared 0.44 M stock solution were added according to the specified conditions. The pH was
adjusted once, after the addition of all reagents, using 1 M H₂SO₄ or 1 M NaOH, and the reactions
were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 20 ± 1 °C in covered flasks.

The concentration of urea, cations and anions were determined colorimetrically on an automated
GalleryTM Discrete Analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using standard methods of the
equipment. Soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured using a Spectroquant COD Cell
Test (114555, Merck KGaA, Germany) in the range 500-10000 mg L-1. UV absorbance was
measured using a LAMBDA 365 double-beam UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer-Inc, USA).
The concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured by reacting urine with titanium(IV)
oxysulfate in sulfuric acid solution (27–31% H₂SO₄ basis) and measuring the absorbance at 405
nm (Arve and Popat, 2021). All samples were diluted using Milli-Q water and the pH was adjusted
where necessary to fall within the range of the analytical method.

phospholipids, biogenic amines, organic acids, acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins, and
nucleotides/nucleosides via derivatisation, analyte extraction, and selective detection through
multiple reaction monitoring pairs, with isotope-labelled internal standards and other internal
references for quantification. The assay utilised a 96-well deep plate format with an attached
filter plate for sample preparation. For metabolites other than organic acids, samples were
thawed, vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 × g and dried under nitrogen flow, before phenylisothiocyanate derivatisation. Post-incubation, the spots were re-dried using an evaporator, and
metabolites were extracted with 300 µL of extraction solvent. Extracts were centrifuged into a
lower 96-well plate and diluted with MS running solvent. Organic acids were prepared separately
with 3-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatisation, followed by the addition of BHT stabiliser and water
before LC-MS injection. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on an ABSciex 5500 Qtrap ®
MS coupled with an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). Data
processing was performed using Analyst 1.6.3 software (Sciex, USA). In this paper, the term
"organic metabolites" (OMs) refers specifically to the organic compounds in urine quantified
through the targeted metabolomics approach outlined above. Notably, this term excludes urea,

Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to examine whether the variability in the
degradation of organic metabolites in urine could be accounted for by computed or predicted
property descriptors of these metabolites, as provided in the human urine metabolome database.
The descriptors included water solubility, LogP, LogS, pKa, hydrogen bond acceptor and donor
counts, polar surface area, rotatable bond count, ring count, refractivity, and polarisability
(Bouatra et al., 2013). All statistical analyses were performed in RStudio (version 2023.12.0 +

In CF1 urine matrix, the optimal operating conditions for Fenton oxidation, to ensure complete
H2O2 activation and maximum COD removal, were determined to be a molar H2O2 to Fe2+ ratio of
1:1 and pH of 4.0. Under these conditions, 38% of the COD was removed in urine (Figure 1B).
Activation refers to the percentage of H2O2 that has reacted or been converted to other forms,
indirectly indicating hydroxyl radical formation. The Fe2+ dose is important because it catalyses
the decomposition of H2O2, but should be minimised to reduce operating costs, chemical sludge
formation, and residual Fe in solution. As shown in Figure 1A, a 1:1 molar ratio of H 2O2 to Fe2+
was required to ensure complete H2O2 activation. Beyond this ratio, the COD removal decreased
marginally. Urine required approximately five times more Fe catalyst than synthetic urine (Figure
S2 in SI) to ensure complete H2O2 activation. Furthermore, the Fenton reaction reached
equilibrium within five minutes in urine but took over two hours in synthetic urine (Figure S3 in
SI). These observations suggest that the cycle of Fe2+ regeneration (Equation 2) in urine is being
interrupted. It is hypothesised that the organic compounds present in urine scavenge Fe 3+ ions,
forming insoluble iron(III) organic complexes through a ligand exchange mechanism (Ma et al.,
2022) thus preventing the regeneration of Fe2+. Supporting this hypothesis, Simbeye et al. (2023),
observed co-precipitation of organics with iron during vivianite recovery from urine dosed with
FeSO₄. The use of reducing agents such as L-cysteine (Luo et al., 2016) and citric acid (Seol and
Javandel, 2008) may enhance Fe²⁺ regeneration in the presence of organic inhibitors by aiding in
electron transfer.

An analysis of the effect of operating pH on COD removal, residual Fe 2+ and orthophosphate
concentrations is shown in Error! Reference source not found.B and Error! Reference source
not found.C. Complete H2O2 activation was achieved at all tested pH levels. The removal of COD
increased from 22% at a pH 2.5 to a maximum of 38% at pH 4.0 and then decreased to 27% at pH
6.0. UV₂₅₄ removal, a surrogate parameter for predicting organic carbon content in wastewater
(Altmann et al., 2016), followed the same trend as COD removal (Fig. S4 in SI) and showed a
moderate correlation with it (R² = 0.6, p = 0.06). A similar trend has been observed in studies
investigating the treatment of landfill leachate using Fenton oxidation (Cetinkaya et al., 2018).
The reduced COD removal at low pHs is attributed to high H+ concentration, which facilitates the
formation of H3O2+ through Equation 10 (Kwon et al., 1999), thus reducing the availability of H 2O2
for •OH generation. In addition, H+ ions can scavenge •OH radicals via Equation 11 (Sun et al.,
2007), further limiting organics oxidation in urine.

The reduced COD removal at higher pH values is hypothesised to be due to the rapid conversion
of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and the formation of ferric oxyhydroxide compounds which react more slowly with
H2O2 (Gogate and Patil, 2015). In addition, at higher pHs, hydroxyl radicals tend to undergo
secondary reactions with hydroxide ions (OH-), forming less reactive species like the superoxide
radical (⋅O2) (Buxton et al., 1988). This was observed visually, with higher formations of sludge
occurring in the pH range of 3.5-6. However, the COD removal at pH 6 (27%) is still relatively high
compared to the maximum removal at pH 4 (38%), suggesting that Fenton oxidation could be
effectively applied to freshly excreted urine stabilised with peroxide, without requiring strict pH
correction.

The residual Fe²⁺ concentration in urine was highest at pH 2.5 (28% of added Fe²⁺) and decreased
with increasing pH (Figure 1C ). Phosphorus precipitation exceeded 94% across all pH levels.
According to our thermodynamic modelling, ferric phosphate (Fe(PO₄)) forms between pH 1.2
and 4.2, while iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃) and meta vivianite (Fe₃(PO₄)₂·8H₂O) precipitate at pHs
above 3 and 3.8, respectively (Fig S1 in SI). Minimal sludge formation was observed at pH 2.5–3,
likely due to partial reduction of Fe³⁺ back to Fe²⁺ (Equation 2), limiting iron precipitation as
Fe(PO₄). At pH 3.5–6, significant sludge formation was observed visually, attributed to Fe(OH)₃
and Fe₃(PO₄)₂·8H₂O precipitation (Simbeye et al., 2023). The initial phosphorus concentration
was 8.6 mmol L⁻¹, indicating that depending on the type of iron precipitate formed, between 30%
and 44% of the added Fe²⁺ may have been consumed in this reaction.

When evaluating the effect of urine CF, the H2O2 dose was scaled proportionally to the CF whilst
the H2O2:Fe molar ratio was fixed at 1:1 and pH 4. Complete H2O2 activation was observed in all
cases. Increasing the CF had no significant effect on COD removal and residual Fe2+ concentration
but did result in increased urea, chloride (Figure 2A), and ammonium (Table S3 in SI) oxidation.
Urea oxidation was approximately three-fold higher at CF4 and four-fold higher at CF6 compared
to CF1. However, there was no clear correlation between the extent of urea oxidation and chloride
oxidation across different CFs. Treating urine at CF1 with Fenton oxidation appears optimal, as it
effectively targets the degradation of organic compounds while minimising nutrient losses. The
oxidation of urea and ammonium is hypothesised to occur due to the presence of chloride ions,
which scavenge hydroxyl radicals to form reactive chloride species that, in turn, oxidise nitrogencontaining compounds (Clark et al., 2021), with N2 gas and nitrate as the final reaction products
(Cho and Hoffmann, 2014). This aligns with the observed increase in nitrate concentration across
all CFs (Table S3 in SI).

As expected, increasing the H2O2 dose and the iron catalyst increases hydroxyl radical formation,
leading to higher oxidation of both organic and inorganic compounds in urine. Doubling the H₂O₂
dose significantly increased COD removal from 34.8 to 67.6%. However, a subsequent doubling
of the dose resulted in only a marginal additional removal of 7%, indicating diminishing returns
at higher dosages (Figure 2B ). A similar trend was observed by Kallel et al. (2009) during Fenton
oxidation of landfill leachate. Diminishing COD removal could be due to excess H2O2 or Fe2+
reacting with hydroxyl radicals (Tang and Huang, 1997). It is also possible that easily oxidisable
compounds are degraded first, leaving behind refractory, difficult-to-oxidise compounds.
Hydroxyl radicals preferentially target bonds that are easier to break, and once these are
exhausted, the remaining compounds are more resistant to further oxidation, leading to reduced
oxidative efficiency at higher reagent doses (Pignatello et al., 2006). The increase in COD removal
with increasing H₂O₂ dose also suggests that organics are preferentially oxidised over urea and
chloride, which exhibit slower reactivity with hydroxyl radicals. Urea oxidation increased from
3.3 to 10% when the H2O2 dose was increased from 1 to 4 g L-1. Thus, determining the optimal
H2O2 dose requires balancing this trade-off on a case-by-case basis.

The targeted metabolomics assay identified 200 metabolites in acidified unconcentrated urine
(Table S4 in SI). Creatinine, citric acid, hippuric acid, methylhistidine, histidine, glucose, and uric
acid accounted for over 70% of the total concentration of organic metabolites (ΣOMs = 3.23 g L⁻¹).
Nearly 150 metabolites were oxidisable by Fenton’s reagent, resulting in a ΣOMs degradation of
59% in CF1 urine treated at pH 4.0 with 1 g H₂O₂ L⁻¹ and 1:1 H₂O₂: Fe²⁺ molar ratio. Increasing
the oxidant dose to 4 g H₂O₂ L⁻¹ under the same conditions increased the number of oxidisable
metabolites to 177 in CF1X urine, with ΣOMs degradation improving to 77%, consistent with
observed COD removal trends (Figure 2). The ΣOMs degradation in concentrated urine matrices
was higher than in unconcentrated urine when treated under identical conditions, with H 2O2
doses scaled proportionally to the CF of the urine. While increased ionic strength at higher CFs
can affect the oxidation kinetics of Fe2+ (Santana-Casiano et al., 2000) and the degradation of
organic compounds (Lipczynska-Kochany et al., 1995), the disproportionate increase in initial
ΣOMs concentration with CF during evaporation likely also contributed to the higher observed
degradation in concentrated urine. The mass concentration of ΣOMs in untreated CF4 urine and
CF6 urine was 2.4× and 5.7× that of untreated CF1 urine, respectively, suggesting that some
metabolites were not fully retained in solution during evaporation. For instance, metabolites such
as glutamic acid, N2-acetylornithine, isoleucine, and glutamine were below the LOD in CF6 urine,
despite being detectable in CF1 urine (Table S4 in SI). Overall, treating unconcentrated urine with
a higher H2O2 dose resulted in the highest median degradation of metabolites across superclasses
(Fig 3), suggesting that the oxidant dose has a greater impact on organic degradation than the
urine matrix.

Organic oxygen compounds, benzenoids, organoheterocyclic compounds, and phenylpropanoids
were generally more oxidisable, with median degradation values exceeding 80% across all
treatments. In contrast, lipids, lipid-like molecules, and nucleosides were more resistant to
oxidation, particularly in unconcentrated urine at the lower H2O2 dose (Figure 3). The resistance
of lipids to oxidation is consistent with earlier work, where median degradation was less than
50% in urine acidified to pH 3.0 and treated with 60 mM peroxydisulphate at 90 °C for 1 h
(Mehaidli et al., 2024). PCA revealed that molecular property descriptors poorly explained the
variability in degradation, whether evaluated for individual metabolites or grouped into
superclasses (Fig. S5 in SI). A weak positive correlation with polar surface area (PSA, r=0.32) and
a moderate negative correlation with molecular weight (MolWt, r=−0.36) suggested that smaller,
more polar, and hydrophilic compounds are more susceptible to oxidation by Fenton’s reagent.
These findings align with studies in other wastewater matrices showing that molecular size and
polarity are key determinants of oxidant reactivity (Pignatello et al., 2006).

There was efficient degradation of benzenoid hormones, including dopamine, norepinephrine,
and epinephrine, as well as low-molecular-weight organics, such as citric acid, glutamic acid, and
caffeic acid, with metabolite concentrations below the LOD in treated urine samples. Notably,
organics that are known to foul membranes during urine treatment, such as uric acid (Courtney
and Randall, 2022) and sugars (Guizani et al., 2022), were nearly completely degraded in all
matrices. The degradation of creatinine, the major metabolite in urine, was 40% in CF1 but
improved to 65% in CF1X with the higher H2O2 dose (Figure 4). Glucose, ethanolamine,
phenylacetylglutamine and threonic acid exhibited moderate resistance to oxidation, with both
H2O2 dose and urine CF influencing their degradation efficiency. In contrast, taurine and alanine
were poorly oxidised across all treatments, suggesting low reactivity with hydroxyl radicals.

The concentration of several metabolites in urine increased post-Fenton oxidation, with the most
significant increases observed for allantoin, creatine, guanidinopropionic acid, methylamine,
trimethylamine, glycine, N2-acetyl-ornithine, and guanidoacetic acid (Table S4 in SI). These
increases likely result from the partial oxidation or breakdown of parent compounds present in
urine. Complete degradation of trimethylamine N-oxide across all matrices likely contributed to
the release of trimethylamine and methylamine (Loo et al., 2022). Allantoin is a known oxidative
product of uric acid (Tsahar et al., 2006). Guanidinopropionic acid and guanidoacetic acid were
likely derived from the oxidative cleavage of guanidino-containing compounds such as arginine
and creatinine (Marescau et al., 1992). The increase in N2-acetyl-ornithine can be attributed to
the breakdown of ornithine (Majumdar et al., 2016), which was degraded by 78% in CF1 urine.
Glycine may have been produced through the hydrolysis or oxidative cleavage of proteins,
peptides, or amino acid derivatives (Liu et al., 2017).

Conclusions and recommendations

361
362

This study demonstrates the potential and limitations of Fenton oxidation for selectively treating
real human urine, balancing COD removal with the preservation of urea, a key fertiliser nutrient.
Fenton oxidation in urine is optimised at pH 4.0 and a 1:1 Fe²⁺: H₂O₂ molar ratio, achieving a
ΣOMs degradation of 59%, and retaining 97% of the urea, in unconcentrated urine treated with 1
g H₂O₂ L⁻¹. The process remained effective at pH 6.0, suggesting that it could be applied to treat
fresh urine stabilised with peroxide, without pH adjustment.

363
364
365
366
367

The formation of iron-organic complexes and iron phosphate precipitates in urine, resulting from
Fe³⁺ scavenging, likely contributed to the observed ivefold increase in Fe²⁺ demand for complete
H₂O₂ activation compared to synthetic urine. Future studies could explore alternative urine
stabilisation strategies, such as citric acid instead of sulphuric acid, to improve Fe2+ regeneration
and reduce sludge formation.

368
369
370
371
372
373
374

Fenton oxidation is best suited for treating unconcentrated urine, as higher mass concentration
factors resulted in increased oxidation of urea, ammonium, and chloride, reducing nutrient
recovery efficiency and overall treatment effectiveness. Notably, there was no clear correlation
between the extent of urea and chloride oxidation across different CFs, suggesting that urea
removal may not be directly linked to chloride scavenging alone. Although chloride oxidation was
minimal (3% in CF1 urine), further work is needed to determine the potential formation of
chlorination by-products in urine.

375
376
377
378
379
380
381

The oxidant dose was found to be a stronger determinant of organic degradation efficiency than
the urine matrix itself. Increasing the H2O2 dose to 4 g L-1 improved the degradation of ΣOMs to
77%, however, this also increased urea (10%) and chloride (9.5%) oxidation. Organic oxygen
compounds, benzenoids, organoheterocyclic compounds, and phenylpropanoids exhibited the
highest degradation efficiencies (>80%), whereas lipids, lipid-like molecules, and nucleosides
were more resistant to oxidation. These findings suggest that Fenton’s reagent preferentially
oxidises smaller, more polar, and hydrophilic compounds in urine.

382
383
384

In conclusion, Fenton oxidation is a promising approach for degrading organic compounds in
urine, provided treatment conditions are carefully optimised to minimise by-product formation
and maximise nutrient recovery.
