Abstract. The high-temperature (~180 °C) interaction of free-base meso-triarylcorroles and

Re2(CO)10 followed by exposure to PCl3 and thiols (or elemental sulfur) affords rhenium-sulfido
corroles in 67-76% yields. The use of shorter reaction times, lower temperatures (~130 °C), and
a dithiol (e.g., ethane-1,2-dithiol) also allows the isolation of rhenium-dithiolato corroles,
presumptive intermediates on the path to ReS corroles. The ReS corroles exhibit high thermal
stability and two reversible oxidations and reductions in their cyclic voltammograms, with redox
potentials nearly identical to those observed for analogous ReO corroles. The electrochemical
HOMO-LUMO gaps of the complexes, at 2.2 eV, are consistent with ligand-centered oxidation
and reduction. The UV-vis spectra of the ReS complexes, on the other hand, differ significantly
from those of their ReO counterparts. Scalar-relativistic DFT calculations suggest that this
difference reflects low-energy LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 levels, consisting of Re-S π-antibonding
interactions; the ReO corroles, in contrast, exhibit a larger LUMO+1/LUMO+2 gap, as expected
for a relatively classical Gouterman-type metalloporphyrin analogue. The high stability of ReS
corroles is consistent with geochemists’ view of rhenium as a moderately chalcophilic element
(i.e., one that partitions into sulfide melts) as well as with a recent quantitative analysis of
thiophilicity, which indicates that rhenium’s oxophilicity and thiophilicity are pretty much
evenly balanced.

INTRODUCTION
The 5d metallocorroles are fascinating complexes, consisting of a sterically constrained corrole
ligand tightly wrapping around a large 5d transition metal ion.1,2 Given the size mismatch
between the metal and the macrocyclic ligand, many of the available synthetic routes are
capricious and proceed with only low to modest yields.3,4,5,6,7,8,9 Once synthesized, however, the
complexes are typically surprisingly robust. Furthermore, several exhibit long-lived triplet states
and efficiently sensitize singlet oxygen formation,10,11,12 promising a variety of applications,
perhaps most notably as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.13,14,15,16 Rheniumoxo17,18,19,20,21,22 and gold23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 corroles are arguably the most promising in this regard,
as far as metallocorroles are concerned.
Rhenium corroles exhibit a variety of structural motifs. While rhenium-oxo corroles are a
key thermodynamic sink, careful manipulation of the synthetic conditions leads variously to
rhenium-imido corroles,31 metal-metal quadruple-bonded rhenium corrole dimers,32,33 and
rhenium biscorrole sandwich compounds.34 Herein, we report two new structural motifs:
rhenium-sulfido corroles and rhenium-dithiolato corroles (Chart 1). The findings add to our
appreciation of rhenium as a chalcophilic metal (i.e., a metal that partitions into sulfide
melts),35,36 which has a strong affinity for not only oxygen but also for sulfur, and potentially
also for the heavier chalcogens.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) Discovery and optimization of synthetic methods. Following similar experiments by
Bröring and coworkers,37 we attempted to activate highly stable ReO meso-triarylcorroles with a
view to installing axial ligands other than oxide. Accordingly, we exposed an ReO triarylcorroles
Re[TpXPC](S) [where TpXPC refers to the meso-tris(para-X-phenyl)corrole ligand and X =
CH3 and OCH3] to an excess of PCl3, a plausible oxygen atom abstractor, in chlorobenzene at
150 °C under anaerobic conditions, followed by addition of thiophenol. We hoped that an ReCl2
corrole intermediate produced in the course of the reaction would ultimately yield Re(SPh)2
corrole as the final product. The final product turned out to be different, with a Soret maximum
at 391 nm and a post-Soret maximum at 276 nm and a molecular mass corresponding to Re[Cor]
+ 32. Obvious formulations for such a product included Re[TpXPC]O2, Re[TpXPC](PH), and
Re[TpXPC](S). High-resolution electrospray ionization MS strongly supported the last
formulation, i.e., Re[Cor](S), which was ultimately confirmed by 3D electron diffraction38 (3DED) for two complexes, Re[TpCH3PC](S) and Re[TpOCH3PC](S).
To develop a general, reproducible, and, ideally, high-yielding synthetic route to ReS
corroles, we investigated both elemental sulfur and simple thiols as sources of the sulfido ligand;
both proved suitable. Our final, optimized synthesis consists of a one-pot, two-stage protocol.
Rhenium insertion was first accomplished via overnight interaction of free-base corrole,
H3[TpXPC], and dirhenium decacarbonyl in the presence of K2CO3 in decalin at 180 °C.
Phosphorus trichloride and ethane-1,2-dithiol were then added, in that order, and the reaction
was continued for several hours. Upon cooling to room temperature and standard work-up and
purification, analytically pure products were obtained in yields of 67-76%. The synthesis appears
to be rather general, with five different Re[TpXPC](S) complexes obtained with comparable ease
(X = CF3, F, H, CH3, and OCH3). Importantly, the high-temperature synthesis also underscores
the impressive thermal and chemical stability of Re-sulfido corroles, which was further
confirmed by the stability of the compounds in refluxing decalin over 12 hours.
In the course of optimizing the above synthesis, we discovered that shorter reaction times
in the second (thiation) stage of the protocol led to a mixture of products, ReO and ReS corroles,
indicating incomplete thiation, and rhenium-ethane-1,2-dithiolato corroles, plausible
intermediates on the path to ReS corroles. The use of both shorter reaction times (~2 h) and
lower temperatures (~130 °C) in the thiation step led to reliable isolation of rhenium-dithiolato

complexes Re[TpXPC](C2H4S2) (X = CF3, F, H, CH3, and OCH3), albeit with ReO and ReS
corroles as co-products. The products could be readily separated with column chromatography.
(b) Proof of composition and structure. As expected, both the sulfido and dithiolato
complexes exhibit diamagnetic 1H NMR spectra, similar to those of ReO,17 OsN,5 and other
square-pyramidal metallocorroles.19-22 Thus, except for those associated with the 5,15-aryl
groups, all peaks proved well-resolved at room temperature. The ortho and meta protons of the
5,15-aryl groups resolved nicely at 243 K and the full spectra were assigned via 2D NMR
analysis. Two exemplary 1H NMR spectra are depicted in Figure 1.

Crystal structures were obtained for Re[TpCH3PC](S) and Re[TpOCH3PC](S) with 3D
ED and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) structures were obtained for
Re[TpCH3PC](S), Re[TpCF3PC](S), and Re[TpCF3PC](S2C2H4) (Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1).
The 3D ED and XRD structures of Re[TpCH3PC](S) are in generally excellent agreement, with
Re-S distances of 2.06(3) and 2.0752(19) Å, respectively. These values are also consistent with
those observed in the SC-XRD structure of Re[TpCF3PC](S) [2.0766(7)] and the 3D ED
structure of Re[TpOCH3PC](S) [2.117(13)]. For the sulfido complexes, the crystallographic ReS distances are also in excellent agreement with scalar-relativistic DFT (OLYP39,40D341,42/ZORA43-STO-TZ2P as implemented in the ADF program system44) optimized geometry
of Re[TPC](S) (TPC = meso-triphenylcorrole, 2.084 Å), as well as with the sum of Pyykkö’s
triple-bond covalent radii for Re and S: 1.10 + 0.95 = 2.05 Å.45,46 The sum of the corresponding
double bond radii (2.13 Å), on the other hand, appears to be somewhat larger than both the SCXRD and DFT values, suggesting that the Re-S interactions are best viewed as triple bonds, as
indeed expected from elementary ligand field theory considerations. For the reader’s
convenience, Chart 2 presents a more visual representation of Re-sulfido distances obtained by
different methods. In contrast to the above, the Re-S distances in the dithiolato complex
Re[TpCF3PC](S2C2H4) average around 2.3 Å, the higher value reflecting the lower bond order of
the bonds in question. Other structural features of the complexes, such as the average Re-N
distances and Re-N4 displacements, are unremarkable and very similar to those observed for ReO
corroles.17

disorder and solvent molecules have been omitted for clarity.
(c) UV-vis and electrochemical studies. Insight into the electronic structure of the new
complexes was gleaned from UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Figure 5), cyclic voltammetry
(Figure 6), and the aforementioned DFT calculations. Although the new ReS corroles exhibit
essentially the same Q band maxima (573 ± 2 nm) as analogous ReO corroles, indicating nearidentical HOMO-LUMO gaps, the overall spectral profiles are quite different, indicating
substantial differences in the valence MO architecture. Compared with ReO corroles, the ReS
corroles exhibit several broad absorptions in the 250-620 nm range. Thus, significant shoulders
are observed for the main Soret feature (392 ± 2 nm) at both lower (275 ± 2 nm) and higher (459
nm) wavelengths. The Re-dithiolato corroles also exhibit numerous broad absorptions in the 250620 nm region. Interestingly, the lowest-energy maxima of the dithiolato complexes (~590 nm)
are somewhat redshifted relative to their ReS counterparts (573 ± 2 nm). A wider spread of the
absorption features may explain why the main features of the ReS and Re-dithiolato corroles
seem weaker than those of their ReO congeners (which presumably exhibit multiple nearcoincident absorptions).

Cyclic voltammetry revealed two reversible oxidations and two reversible reductions for
each ReS corrole. The complexes were found to exhibit relatively high first oxidation potentials,
0.89 to 1.07 V, and relatively low first reduction potentials, -1.27 to -1.15 V, vs. the SCE, as
expected for an electronically innocent corrole macrocycle with a high-valent central metal
ion.47,48 The electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gap (i.e., the algebraic difference between the first
oxidation and reduction potentials) of 2.2 V is essentially the same as that observed for ReO
corroles, consistent with the Q bands maxima for ReO and ReS corroles. In contrast, the Redithiolato corroles are both ~100 mV easier to oxidize and ~100 mV easier to reduce than their
ReS counterparts, which translates to a smaller electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gap of ~2.0 V,
implicating a certain role for Re-dithiolato-based orbitals in the redox processes.
DFT calculations provided a neat explanation for the conundrum that analogous ReO and
ReS triarylcorroles exhibit near-identical cyclic voltammograms but substantially different
optical spectra. An examination of the Kohn-Sham MOs indicated that while the four
Gouterman-type49,50,51,52 frontier orbitals are very similar in shape (which are well-established
from earlier work47,53 and accordingly are not depicted here) and orbital energy for the two
classes of complexes, the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 in the ReS complexes are much lower in
energy and closer to the frontier region. These correspond to the two ReS p* MOs and their low
orbital energies account for the relatively complex absorption profile of ReS corroles relative to

their relative ReO counterparts. Full photophysical and quantum chemical analyses of ReS
corroles will be presented in a follow-up paper on the subject.
(d) Reflections on chalcophilicity. Given the broad prevalence of the ReVO (rhenyl) and
ReVIIO3 (perrhenyl) groups, as well as the perrhenate anion (ReO4–), rhenium is often viewed as
an oxophilic element by coordination chemists.54,55,56 Geochemists, however, have a somewhat
different perspective and regard rhenium as a moderately chalcophilic element (i.e., one that
partitions itself into sulfide melts). Thus, in nature, rheniun occurs almost exclusively as part of
sulfide minerals such as molybdenite (MoS2). A recently developed, quantitative scale of
thiophilicity (based on element-chalcogen bond energies) supports the latter view, i.e., rhenium
is equally oxophilic and thiophilic. Such a view qualitatively explains the high thermal stability
of the ReS corroles reported herein. Scalar-relativistic calculations also support this view. Thus,
very similar electronic reaction energies are calculated for the following three reactions:
Re[Cor](O) + Me3P = 1/2 {Re[Cor]}2 + Me3PO;

DE = -0.59 eV;

Re[Cor](S) + Me3P = 1/2 {Re[Cor]}2 + Me3PS;

DE = -0.54 eV;

Re[Cor](Se) + Me3P = 1/2 {Re[Cor]}2 + Me3PSe.

DE = -0.48 eV.

The results indicate that differences in Re-Ch (Ch = O, S, Se) bond energies as a function of the
chalcogen are roughly similar to differences in phosphine-chalcogen bond energies. Since ReO
corroles17 and organophosphine chalcogenides57,58 (Ch = O, S, Se) are well-known as stable
substances, it makes sense that ReS corroles and as-yet-unknown ReSe corroles should also be
so.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In summary, we have described the discovery and synthesis of rhenium-sulfido and rheniumdithiolato corroles, two new structural motifs in the growing family of 5d metallocorroles. The
ReS corroles exhibit high thermal stability, which may lend itself to practical applications. The
findings add to our appreciation of rhenium as a moderately chalcophilic metal, with comparable
oxophilic and thiophilic character. We may even envision a new chapter in the coordination
chemistry of corroles, in which corroles serve as a privileged platform for stabilizing new 5d-np
(n > 2) multiple bonds.59

Materials and methods. All chemicals were purchased from Merck, with the notable exception
of free-base triarylcorroles, which were prepared according to literature procedures.60,61
UV-visible-NIR spectra were recorded on an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR
spectra were recorded on 400 MHz Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm
BB/1 H SmartProbe at 298 K in CDCl3 and 243 K in CD2Cl2 and referenced to residual CHCl3 at
7.26 ppm and CH2Cl2 at 5.31 ppm. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra (HRESI-MS) were recorded on an LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer in positive mode.
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at ambient temperature with a Gamry Reference 620
potentiostat equipped with a three-electrode system: a 3 mm disk glassy carbon working
electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode
(SCE).Tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Anhydrous CH2Cl 2 (Aldrich) was used as the solvent. The electrolyte solution was purged with
argon for at least 2 min prior to all measurements, which were carried out under anargon blanket.
The glassy carbon working electrode was polished using a polishing pad and 0.05 μm polishing
alumina from ALS, Japan. All potentials were referenced to the SCE.
Re[TpXPC](S). To a 50-mL two-necked round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux
condenser and containing decalin (15 mL) and a magnetic stirring bar were added a free-base
corrole, H3[TpXPC] (0.19 mmol), Re2(CO)10 (248.1 mg, 0.38 mmol), and potassium carbonate
(150 mg). The contents were deoxygenated with a flow of argon and then refluxed overnight
with constant stirring under argon. Phosphorus trichloride (165 µL, 10 equiv) and ethane-1,2dithiol (160 µL, 10 equiv) were then added and the reaction was continued under reflux (i.e., at
~180 °C) for ~5 h. The color of the reaction slowly turned to brown and completion of the
reaction was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Upon cooling, the
reaction mixture was loaded directly on to silica gel column with n-heptane as the mobile phase.
The decalin was first removed by eluting with pure n-heptane. Different solvent mixtures were
then used to elute the various ReS corroles: 2:1 n-heptane/dichloromethane for X = CF3, H, CH3
and F; 1:2 n-heptane/dichloromethane for X = OCH3. All fractions with lmax ~391 nm were
collected and evaporated to dryness. The products were further purified with a second round of
column chromatography and finally with preparative thin-layer chromatography, all with the
same solvent system as in the first round. Yields and analytical details for the different
complexes are given below.

General procedure for the synthesis of Re[TpXPC](S2C2H4). To a 50-mL two-necked
round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and containing decalin (15 mL) and a magnetic
stirring bar were added a free-base corrole, H3[TpXPC] (0.096 mmol), Re2(CO)10 (125.3 mg,
0.192 mmol), and potassium carbonate (100 mg). The contents were deoxygenated with a flow
of argon and then refluxed overnight with constant stirring under argon. Upon lowering the
reaction temperature to ~130 °C, phosphorus trichloride (165 µL, 10 equiv) and ethane-1,2dithiol (160 µL, 10 equiv) were added and the reaction continued for an additional 2 h. Mass
spectrometric analysis of the reaction mixture indicated the presence of a mixture of products,
including ReO, ReS, and Re-thiolato corroles. Heating was stopped at that point so as to
intercept the Re-thiolato corroles, the presumptive intermediates on the way to ReS corroles.
Upon cooling to room temperatue, the reaction mixture was loaded directly on to silica gel
column with n-heptane as the mobile phase. Decalin was first removed by eluting with pure
heptane. Different solvent mixtures were then used to elute the various mixtures. The wine-red
ReO corroles eluted first with 3:1 n-heptane/dichloromethane, followed by brown ReS corroles,
which were eluted with 2:1 n-heptane/dichloromethane. Finally, the Re-dithiolato corroles were
eluted with pure dichloromethane. The latter were further purified by preparative thin layer using
1:1 n-heptane/dichloromethane as the mobile phase. The brown final products (lmax ~363 nm)
were collected and fully characterized, as detailed below.

Sample preparation for crystallography. Crystals were grown by slow diffusion of
methanol into concentrated solutions of the samples in dichloromethane.
3D electron diffraction (3D ED). A drop of a suspension containing microcrystals was
deposited on a microscopy glass slide and allowed to evaporate in air. Once the mother liquor
had dried, polarized light microscopy was used to verify the crystallinity of the solid deposit. The
solid was then gently scraped from the glass and deposited onto a 300-mesh copper TEM grid
coated with a continuous film of ultrathin amorphous carbon (from Electron Microscopy
Sciences). 3D ED Electron diffraction measurements were performed at ambient temperature and
high vacuum on a Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-ED electron diffractometer,62 equipped with a
lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) electron source operating at 200 kV (l = 0.0251 Å). Diffraction
patterns were collected with a Rigaku HyPix-ED detector with a scan width of 0.5° during
continuous rotation of the crystals over ~120°. Diffraction data were collected on five crystals
for each complex using the CrysAlisPro63 program. The best diffracting crystals were platelets a
few microns wide and less than 0.5 μm thick. An area of approximately 1-2 μm in diameter was
used to collect data from thin regions of the crystals. Data processing was carried out with PETS
2.064 or CrysAlisPro.63 For Re[TpCH3PC](S), the structure was solved from a single dataset with
85% completeness. Due to the lower crystallographic symmetry of Re[TpOCH3PC](S), the
integrated intensities of two crystals were merged with CrysAlisPro to achieve a completeness of
95.4 %.
The crystal structures were solved ab initio with SHELXT65 and OLEX266 and the
positions of all non-hydrogen atoms could be determined and refined with anisotropic
displacement parameters (ADP). Least-squares refinement in kinematic approximation was
performed with the programs SHELXL67 and ShelXle68 using scattering factors for electrons.69
An extinction coefficient was refined to mitigate the effect of multiple diffraction. Because of the
limited resolution of the diffraction data, soft restraints were applied to preserve the geometry of
the substituents and the consistency of ADPs. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically
idealized positions and refined with a riding model. The structures feature large void channels
(10-18 % of the unit cell volume) but no solvent molecules were located in the voids; they were
probably completely removed under the high vacuum conditions in the electron diffractometer.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. X-ray data were collected on beamline 12.2.1
at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Samples were mounted
on MiTeGen Kapton loops and placed in a 100(2) K nitrogen cold stream provided by an Oxford
Cryostream 800 Plus low-temperature apparatus on the goniometer head of a Bruker D8
diffractometer equipped with a PHOTON II CPAD detector operating in shutterless mode.
Diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation monochromated using silicon(111) to
a wavelength of 0.7288(1)Å. An approximate full-sphere of data was collected using a
combination of φ and ω scans with scan speeds of one second per degree. The structures were
solved by intrinsic phasing (SHELXT65) and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2
(SHELXL-201467). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were
geometrically calculated and refined as riding atoms. A solvent mask was applied within OLEX2
to the Re[TpCH3PC](S) and Re[TpCF3PC](S2C2H4) structures due to highly disordered or illdefined solvent molecules in the outer sphere of the crystal structures.
