Abstract

4

Oxygen isotope ratios of O2 are important tracers for assessing biological activity in biogeo-

5

chemical processes in aquatic environments. In fact, changes of 18 O/16 O and 17 O/16 O ratios

6

of O2 have been successfully implemented as measures for quantifying photosynthetic O2 pro-

7

duction and biological O2 respiration. Despite evidence for light-dependent O2 consumption

8

in sunlit surface waters, however, photochemical O2 loss processes have so far been neglected

9

in the stable isotope-based evaluation of oxygen cycling. Here, we established the magni-

10

tude of O isotope fractionation for abiotic photochemical O2 elimination through formation

11

of singlet O2 , 1O2 , and the ensuing oxygenation and oxidation reactions with organic com-

12

pounds through experiments with rose bengal as 1O2 sensitizer and three different amino

13

acids and furfuryl alcohol as chemical quenchers. Based on the kinetic analysis of light-

14

dependent O2 removal in the presence of different quenchers, we rationalize the observable O

15

isotope fractionation of O2 and the corresponding, apparent 18 O kinetic isotope effects (18 O-

16

AKIE) with a pre-equilibrium model for the reversible formation of 1O2 and its irreversible

17

oxygenation reactions with organic compounds. While 18 O-AKIEs of oxygenation reactions

18

amount to 1.03, the O isotope fractionation of O2 vanishes systematically with increasing

19

ratio of the rates of oxygenation reaction of 1O2 vs. 1O2 decay to ground state oxygen, 3O2 .

20

Our findings imply that O isotope fractionation through photochemical O2 consumption can

21

match contributions from biological respiration at typical dissolved organic matter concen-

22

trations of lakes, rivers, and oceans and should therefore be included in future evaluations

23

of biogeochemical O2 cycling.

Introduction

27

Dissolved oxygen, O2 , is a crucial chemical species in biogeochemical cycles of aquatic en-

28

vironments and its concentration a critical parameter used for assessing ecosystem health.

29

Understanding the main processes affecting the dynamics of dissolved O2 concentrations

30

in lakes, rivers, and oceans, namely photosynthesis, respiration, and gas-water exchange,

31

is therefore key to evaluate functions of pristine and human-impacted ecosystems. 1 The

32

quantification of contributions of these three processes of O2 production, consumption, and

33

exchange to the overall O2 cycling is difficult to achieve from the monitoring and modeling

34

of O2 concentration dynamics. To that end, information from the ratios of the three stable

35

O isotopes, 16 O, 17 O, and 18 O, as 18 O/16 O and 17 O/16 O in so-called triple oxygen isotope

36

analysis are increasingly exploited to disentangle contributions of the three main processes

37

of biogeochemical O2 cycling. 1,2

38

In fact, oxygen isotope-based analyses have been successfully implemented in combination

39

with dissolved O2 dynamics and/or O2 -Ar ratios to quantify gross photosynthetic O2 produc-

40

tion, net community O2 production, and photosynthesis rates in the (mixed) surface-layers of

41

various ocean basins. 7–13 These isotope-based assessment of O2 formation and consumption

42

are based on the simplified assumption that respiration, that is the formal 4-electron reduc-

43

tion of O2 to H2 O (Figure 1a), is the dominating O2 sink term. Any other O2 loss processes

44

have thus far been neglected in the evaluation of O isotope ratios. However, this view is

45

being challenged through evidence showing that in sunlit surface waters, light-dependent O2

46

consumption can occur at similar or higher rates than the light-independent (i.e., “dark”)

47

respiration of O2 . 14–20 Such O2 consumption by photochemical reactions in marine waters

48

is estimated to be of the same magnitude as photosynthetic O2 production by phytoplank-

49

ton. 18 Light-dependent O2 consumption can occur through biological and abiotic processes.

50

Biological, light-dependent O2 loss takes place through reduction of O2 initiated by excess

Figure 1 Schematic survey of processes and selected reaction steps responsible for O2 consumption in aquatic environments. (a) Respiration is the enzyme-catalyzed activation of O2 and
stepwise 4-electron reduction to H2 O. Reduction equivalents for O2 reduction from oxidation of
organic substrates and cofactors are represented as electrons (e− ). (b) Abiotic photochemical
O2 consumption is shown here exemplary for processes induced by light-absorption and intersystem crossing of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to its excited triplet states
(3 CDOM∗ ). C–H and C• stand for organic compounds and carbon-centered radicals, respectively.
Reactions of 3 CDOM∗ with 3O2 act as source of 1O2 (red arrow). 1O2 loss processes contributing to photochemical O2 consumption (blue arrows) include oxygenation of organic compounds
and one-electron reduction, for example, with phenols (R-OH) and organic amines (R−NH2 ), to
O2 •− . 3–6

electrons from photosystem II and, similarly to respiration, leads to the formation of wa-

52

ter. 19,21 Abiotic, photochemical processes, by contrast, proceeds through several, chemically

53

distinct paths of O2 elimination (Figure 1b).
Abiotic photochemical O2 consumption is initiated by the light-absorption of chromophoric

54

55

dissolved organic matter (CDOM), nitrate, nitrite, or transition-metals and ensuing reactions

56

with O2 . These reactions typically lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)

57

namely singlet oxygen ( 1O2 ), superoxide (O2 •− ), and hydroxyl radicals (• OH), as well as

58

other transient reactive intermediates. 22 Figure 1b illustrates typical reaction sequences fol-

59

lowing the formation of triplet-excited states of CDOM (3 CDOM∗ ). 23,24 Short-lived 3 CDOM∗

60

intermediates initiate a cascade of reactions that is responsible for O2 consumption. Note

61

that these reactions also depend on O2 spin state. 3 CDOM∗ reacts with ground state (triplet)

62

dioxygen, 3O2 , to O2 •− , and more reduced ROS as well as with organic carbon (shown in

63

Figure 1b as C–H) to carbon-centered radicals (C• ). Both processes ultimately consume

64

3

O2 through formation of water and oxygenated carbon species (e.g., carbonly and alco-

65

hol species). Alternatively, reactions of 3O2 with 3 CDOM∗ results in transient 1O2 .

66

species also contribute to further reductive oxygen elimination; on the one hand through

67

oxygenation reactions such as the formation of endo- and hydroperoxides with olefinic and

68

aromatic compounds. 25 On the other hand, 1O2 enables the one-electron oxidation of or-

69

ganic compounds and formation of O2 •− 3,26,27 and oxygenation of organic carbon through

70

ROS generated from O2 •− . Abiotic photochemical O2 consumption thus happens in a series

71

of oxidation and oxygenation reactions that involve both 3O2 and 1O2 species. However,

72

changes of O isotope ratios in O2 from O2 loss processes in aquatic environments have so

73

far been determined exclusively for reactions of 3O2 . It therefore remains unclear whether

74

O2 consumption through reactions of 1O2 exert any effect on the observable 18 O/16 O and

75

76

17

O/16 O ratios of O2 .

because of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of (bio)chemical reactions, that is the different

78

rate constants pertinent to the transformation of heavy (i.e., 18 O/16 O or 17 O/16 O) and light

79

(16 O16 O) dioxygen isotopologues. This phenomenon is quantified in terms of O isotopic

80

enrichment factors, O-ϵ. For changes of 18 O/16 O ratios, for example, the 18 O-ϵ follows from

81

eq 1.

82

where 16 k and 18 k are the rate constants for reactions of 16 O16 O and 18 O16 O isotopologues,

83

respectively, and 18 O-KIE is the corresponding kinetic isotope effect. Note that the same

84

definition applies to 17 O-ϵ and 17 O-KIE for reactions of 16 O16 O and 17 O16 O isotopologues.

85

O-ϵ values reflect how bonds in O2 are broken and formed and are hence specific for the type

86

of reaction or process responsible for O2 consumption. 28 18 O-ϵ values for O2 respiration by

87

aquatic microbial communities, in fact, are confined to a narrow range between −17h and

88

−21h. 29–31 These numbers correspond to apparent 18 O-KIE of approx. 1.02. Conversely,

89

18

O-ϵ values for abiotic photochemical O2 consumption determined with selected CDOM

90

species of different origins amount to −8h to −10h. 32,33 The apparent difference to 18 O-ϵ

91

data for respiration is key to disentangle competing oxygen consumption processes in the

92

biogeochemical O2 cycling.

93

Unfortunately, contributions of reactions of 1O2 to the observed 18 O-ϵ values for abiotic

94

photochemical O2 consumption were not elucidated so far. Given that the photochemistry

95

of 1O2 is well-understood, 3,22,23,34–38 the isotope fractionation of O2 tied to the fate of 1O2

96

can be rationalized with two main processes (Figure 1b). First, the reversible formation of

97

1

O2 from energy transfer of 3 CDOM∗ to 3O2 and 1O2 decay back to 3O2 . Second, chemical

98

reactions of 1O2 through oxygenation of susceptible moieties of CDOM or other organic

99

compounds and 1O2 reduction to O2 •− . Isotope fractionation of reactants in such pre-

100

equilibrium kinetic regimes are well understood from studies of enzyme kinetics. 39,40 Such

101

analyses of pre-equilibrium kinetics and isotope fractionation allow one to postulate that the

102

maximum observable O2 isotope fractionation will be determined primarily by the isotope

103

effects pertinent to 1O2 loss reactions, that is oxygenation to peroxide products and electron

104

transfer to O2 •− . However, the expression of isotope fractionation in O2 will critically depend

105

on the ratio of rates of 1O2 decay to 3O2 vs. oxygenation and electron transfer. As is known

106

from reactions of enzymatically activated dioxygen species, such oxygenation and electron

107

transfer reactions can exhibit substantial 18 O-KIEs of up to 1.05. 41–48

108

The goal of this work was to explore the magnitude and variability of isotope fractiona-

109

tion of reactions of O2 through photochemical formation of 1O2 . To that end, we studied O2

110

isotope fractionation associated with the formation of 1O2 and the reaction of 1O2 with reac-

111

tive functional groups present in dissolved organic matter in laboratory model systems with

112

probe compounds for 1O2 -reactive CDOM moieties of known reactivity towards 1O2 . Specif-

113

ically, we (i) examined the kinetics of O2 consumption through 1O2 -dependent pathways to

114

identify kinetic regimes pertinent to hypothesized processes of reversible 1O2 formation vs.

115

irreversible 1O2 forward reactions. To that end, we established experimental conditions that

116

enabled the analyses of O2 reaction kinetics and isotope fractionating processes in experi-

117

ments with rose bengal, a well-studied 1O2 sensitizer, as well as three different amino acids

118

and furfuryl alcohol as chemical quenchers of 1O2 , 3,49 to which we refer to in the following as

119

probe compounds. (ii) We determined 18 O-ϵ values for 1O2 formation from O2 and ensuing

120

reactions of 1O2 with various probe compounds and experimental conditions. (iii) Finally,

121

we evaluated the 18 O KIEs of 1O2 reactions with probe compounds and discuss implications

122

for applying O isotope analysis of O2 for assessment of photochemical O2 consumption.

Chemicals and solutions

125

Unless noted otherwise, chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

126

Furfuryl alcohol (98%), l-histidine (99%), l-methionine (99.5%), and l-tyrosine (99%) were

127

used as probe compounds and rose bengal (95%) was used as a 1O2 sensitizer. Furfuryl al-

128

cohol was distilled prior to use. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (NaH2 PO4 · 2 H2 O,

129

99%, Merck KGaA), dipotassium phosphate anhydrous (K2 HPO4 , 99%, Merck KGaA), hy-

130

drochloric acid (HCl, 37%, VWR Chemicals), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98%) were used

131

for making buffer solutions. Sodium sulfite anhydrous (Na2 SO3 , 98%) was used to calibrate

132

optical oxygen sensors. All solutions were prepared in air-equilibrated ultrapure water (18.2

133

MΩ·cm, ELGA LabWater). He (99.999%), N2 (99.999%), and O2 (99.995%) were obtained

134

from Carbagas.

135

Irradiation experiments

136

Irradiation experiments were performed in completely filled 12 mL Exetainer (15.5 mm o.d.,

137

Labco Limited) sealed with screw caps and butyl rubber septa or 12 mL crimp-top vials (22.5

138

mm o.d.) sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp caps. All experiments were

139

performed in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 (furfuryl alcohol), 7.7 (histidine), or 8.4

140

(methionine, tyrosine). The pH was chosen to match experimental conditions under which

141

second-order reaction rate constants of the probe compounds with 1O2 were determined. 50–52

142

O2 was selectively generated by visible light irradiation of rose bengal (0.4 − 20 µM). A

30 W fluorescent light bulb or an overhead projector were used as an irradiation source

144

at a distance of 10 − 40 cm and 500 − 2000 cm, respectively. Initial probe compound

145

concentrations were 0.25 − 250 mM for furfuryl alcohol, 0.15 − 100 mM for histidine, 0.2 − 1.2

147

completely filled (i.e., headspace-free) and closed reactors containing buffer solution, probe

148

compound, and rose bengal were irradiated for different amounts of time (up to 240 min)

149

until desired final dissolved O2 concentrations were reached. Control experiments in which

150

no O2 was consumed were performed without addition of rose bengal or probe compounds.

151

Dark controls were performed with reactors wrapped in aluminum foil. All controls were

152

irradiated for the maximum duration of a given experiment. After irradiation, dissolved O2

153

concentrations were measured with an optical oxygen microsensor (PyroScience or PreSens

154

- Precision Sensing), which was introduced into the closed reactors through a needle. 53 O2

155

concentration measurements were temperature corrected and the sensors were calibrated

156

with air-saturated water and with a 300 mM Na2 SO3 solution.

157

Oxygen isotope analysis

158

18

O/16 O ratios of dissolved O2 were measured by gas chromatography coupled to isotope

159

ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) as described previously. 47,54 Briefly, a headspace was

160

created with He (5 mL liquid replaced in Exetainer) or N2 (3 mL liquid replaced in crimp-

161

top vials) in all reactors. Partitioning of O2 into the gas phase was facilitated by horizontal

162

shaking at 200 rpm for 30 min (crimp-top vials) or 60 min (Exetainer) while the vials were

163

kept upside down. Blank samples were prepared by filling vials completely with N2 -purged

164

water in an anaerobic glove box with a N2 atmosphere (MBraun, residual O2 content < 0.1

165

ppm or GS GLOVEBOX Systemtechnik, residual O2 content < 1 ppm). Vials filled with

166

air-equilibrated water and Exetainer containing 150 µL ambient air in He were used as

167

isotopic O2 reference standards. Blanks and standards containing water were prepared for

168

analysis as described above for the samples from irradiation experiments. Most samples were

169

analyzed by the GasBench/IRMS setup described in Bopp et al. 47 with a 60 m Rt-Molsieve

170

5Å PLOT column (Restek from BGB Analytik) at 25°C. Some samples from experiments

171

with furfuryl alcohol were analyzed by the GC/IRMS setup described in Pati et al. 54 with

Data evaluation

176

18

O/16 O ratios are reported as δ 18 O values in per mil (h, ± standard deviation) relative to

177

Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). All δ 18 O values were corrected for blank

178

contributions as described in Pati et al. 54 as well as for instrument linearity (change in δ 18 O

179

values with signal size) and instrument drift (change in δ 18 O values over time). 55 Instrument

180

linearity correction was based on daily measurements of reference gas peaks with different

181

amplitudes and instrument drift correction was based on measurements of standards evenly

182

spread across each measurement sequence. Additionally, a one-point calibration with dilute

183

air standards was applied assuming a δ 18 O value of 23.8h for O2 in ambient air. 56–59 We

184

recently showed that for the range of δ 18 O values measured in this study, such a one-point

185

calibration provide sufficiently accurate 18 O/16 O ratios. 60 Corrected δ 18 O values are reported

186

in permil deviation (h, ± 1 stdev) vs. VSMOW.

The magnitude of O isotope fractionation associated with O2 consumption is reported in
terms of ϵ value (in h, ± 95% confidence intervals), which was calculated as the slope of a

O2 reactions with 1O2 quenchers, that is organic probe compounds as postulated in Figure

199

1b. Typical concentration gradients of O2 from experiments, in which 1O2 is generated with

200

rose bengal as sensitizer and histidine is present as probe compound, are shown in Figure

201

2. Experimental conditions (i.e., different probe compound and rose bengal concentrations,

202

distance to light source) were optimized for convenient sampling time intervals of approx-

203

imately 10 min. Consequently, the maximum irradiation time varied between 16 and 240

204

min for the different experiments. Over this period, 50 − 90% of the initial, dissolved O2

205

(approx. 270 µM) was consumed.

206

Figure 2 emblematically illustrates three typical observations for experiments with his-

207

tidine as probe compound. O2 reaction kinetis were zero-order at an initial histidine con-

208

centration that exceeded that of O2 substantially (100 mM and 0.3 mM for histidine and

209

O2 , respectively). Conversely, O2 consumption kinetics were pseudo-first order when simi-

210

lar initial concentrations of probe compound and O2 were used. Finally, only negligible O2

211

disappearance (i.e., < (2 − 6)% of the initial O2 concentration) was observed in control ex-

212

periments without rose bengal, without probe compound, and in dark controls, where vials

213

containing both rose bengal and probe compounds were wrapped in aluminum foil, respec-

214

tively. The complete compilation of experimental conditions, observed O2 reaction order, and

215

O2 disappearance rate constants for experiments with different probe compounds are shown

216

in Table 1. Note that O2 consumption in experiments with methionine followed apparent

217

zero order kinetics given that initial precursor compound concentrations exceeded dissolved

with results from experiments with elevated concentrations of other probe compounds.

We rationalized the observed reaction order of O2 disappearance using a rate law expres-

Kinetics of O2 consumption follow zero order for large [PC] concentrations when the denom-

250

of the linear regression in Figure 3 is the rate of 1O2 formation, γ 1O2 r3fRB∗ , which appears

251

constant under these experimental conditions. Apparent zero-order rate constants obtained

252

with different light source conditions or with lower rose bengal concentrations do not show

253

this linear correlation. This observation indicates that different rates of 1O2 formation for

254

these cases were likely due to a different r3fRB∗ . This interpretation of the observed O2 dis-

255

appearance supports the validity of the rate law from eq 8, when [PC] is sufficiently large to

256

be considered constant throughout the experiment. Once [PC] becomes small, eq 8 indicates

257

the change from zero- to first-order kinetics as we observed with probe compounds furfuryl

258

alkohol, histidine, and tyrosine. Under these conditions, the rate of O2 consumption is lim-

259

ited by reactions of 1O2 with the probe compound and linearly depends on [PC]. Finally, if

260

the initial probe compound concentrations and that of dissolved O2 are of similar magnitude

261

and decrease at similar rates during the course of the reaction, both 1O2 formation equilibria

262

and irreversible forward reaction with the probe compound contribute to the observed rate

263

of O2 disappearance. The reaction kinetics will then appear to be first order (see entries 3,

264

4, 12, 13, and 16 in Table 1). Collectively, the kinetic analysis with eq 8 allows for disen-

265

tangling the reversible 1O2 formation process and the irreversible reaction of 1O2 with probe

266

compounds. The outcome is also critical to assign any observed O isotope fractionation of

267

O2 to the two processes.

275

minor O isotope fractionation, that is a change in δ 18 O values from 25.3h to 27.5h despite

276

a similar degree of O2 consumption (entry 3, Table 1). Note that the maximum change of

277

δ 18 O observed in a control experiment was 0.7h which we use as lower bound for negligible

278

isotope fractionation comparison. To that end, all of the photochemical experiments shown

279

here reveal some extent of O isotope fractionation which we can thus ascribe to the reaction

280

of dissolved O2 with triplet excited states of rose bengal, the formation of singlet oxygen,

281

and the subsequent reaction between 1O2 and probe compounds.

282

The data in Table 1 shows that O isotope fractionation and thus 18 O-ϵ varies substantially

283

from no fractionation (0.1 ± 0.7)h to −30h for all probe compounds studied. As a gen-

284

eral trend, O isotope fractionation increases (i.e., 18 O-ϵ values become more negative) with

285

decreasing initial probe compound concentration. The extent of O isotope fractionation,

286

however, did not correlate with reaction order. An interpretation of the observed trends

287

of 18 O-ϵ values follows from the evaluation of isotope effects pertinent to the elementary

transfer reactions from the isotopic expression of eq 6 as documented in Section S1 of the

294

Supporting Information. To that end, we consider the ratio of O2 isotopologue disappearance

295

for the two most abundant isotopologues, 16 O16 O and 18 O16 O, to obtain the apparent 18 O-

reaction. 39,40

307

We converted the observable O isotope fractionation which one quantifies with 18 O-ϵ

308

into 18 O-AKIE values by making use of the different reactivity of the probe compounds

309

with 1O2 . Under conditions that favour 1O2 elimination through reactions with the probe

310

compounds, that is at high k3 [PC]/k2 , eq 10 simplifies to KIE1 . As shown in experiments

311

with high furfuryl alcohol concentration where k3 [PC]/k2 = 120 (entry 1 in Table 1), the

312

18

O-AKIE then corresponds to unity and indicates the absence of O isotope fractionation.

313

This observation implies that KIE1 also corresponds to 1.0. This interpretation is supported

314

by the fact that O isotope fractionation of O2 reaction with minor oxygen bonding changes,

315

as in the formation of 1O2 , are indeed small and EIE1 , KIE1 , and KIE2 values equal to

316

unity. 42 Finally, KIE1 , KIE2 , and therefore EIE1 are likely identical and independent of the

317

reaction with any of the probe compounds in our experiments because only O2 , rose bengal,

318

and water are involved in the first reaction step leading to 1O2 formation and decay (see eq

319

3). Following this logic, we are able to deduce the magnitunde of KIE3 from experiments

320

where k3 [PC]/k2 ≪ 1 and 18 O-AKIE then corresponds to KIE3 .

Regardless of the experimental conditions and probe compounds used for quenching 1O2 ,

O-AKIE values follow the general trend outlined in eq 10 with the assumption that the

327

reversible formation of 1O2 from the reaction of O2 with 3 RB∗ does not exhibit O isotope

fractionation. Therefore, isotope effects associated with O2 disappearance reflect the reaction

of 1O2 with the probe compounds. The O isotope fractionation of O2 of these reactions are

O-AKIE values approach a maximum value of 1.028 and 1.031 (solid and dashed lines in

333

334

equilibrium is faster than 1O2 oxygenation and electron transfer.

335

We note, however, small deviations of this general trend for the different probe compounds

336

used. In experiments with methionine, 18 O-AKIEs approach a higher intrinsic KIE3 of 1.031

337

(dashed line in Figure 5) than with histidine (1.026, solid line). 18 O-AKIEs from experiments

338

with tyrosine even decrease slightly from 1.0275 to 1.0240 as forward commitment decreases.

339

Data for 18 O-AKIEs for furfuryl alcohol, unfortunately, only extent do k3 [PC]/k2 of 0.12 and

thus do not allow for observation of the maximum O isotope fractionation. Moreover, some

342

AKIE units higher than rationalized with eq 10 for k3 [PC]/k2 values between 0.3 and 10. We

343

hypothesize that the observed deviations from trends rationalized by eq 10 have two possible

344

origins; distinct reaction mechanisms of 1O2 attack at the probe compounds and, possibly,

345

different concentrations of 1O2 across the various experiments.

346

In fact, based on isotopic pre-equilibrium models underlying eq 10, we assume constant

347

concentrations of 1O2 and 3 RB∗ over the course of an experiment, reactions of O2 and 3 RB∗ as

348

predominant 3 RB∗ quenching mechanism, as well as a constant rate of formation of 3 RB∗ and

349

a constant 1O2 formation yield. Given that the rose bengal concentrations varied between

350

0.5 and 20 µM, the assumptions implied in the pre-equilibrium model are likely not strictly

351

valid for all experimental conditions. The ensuing differences in reaction kinetics could be

352

potential sources of the observed variations of 18 O-AKIE values.

353

Histidine, tyrosine, and furfuryl alcohol share a common initial reaction step through cy-

354

cloaddition of 1O2 to the imidazole, phenyl, and furan moieties of the probe compounds. 38,52

355

It is thus reasonable to assume that the similar 18 O-AKIE values for O2 consumption and

356

consistent trends with k3 [PC]/k2 originate from an intrinsic KIE3 of similar magnitude within

357

the uncertainty of 0.003 AKIE-units identified here (Figure 5). 18 O-AKIEs from experiments

358

with methionine, by contrast, are offset from the other three probe compounds. One pos-

359

sible explanation for this offset is that the initial reaction step of methionine with 1O2 is

360

indeed different. Methionine reacts with 1O2 to a persulfoxide species, 38 where only one

361

O atom of 1O2 participates in S–O bond formation instead of both O atoms in cycloaddi-

362

tion mechanisms. Such correlations of decreasing changes in O bond order with decreasing

363

experimental and theoretical O isotope effects have been established for thermal reduction

364

reactions of O2 . 41 Moreover, the maximum AKIE determined in experiments with methion-

365

ine (1.031, entry 21 in Table 1) is in good agreement with the calculated equilibrium isotope

366

effect for O2 reduction to HO2 – of 1.034. 41 Unfortunately, isotope effect calculations for 1O2

368

with tyrosine, have been restricted to C and H isotopes of the olefinic probe compounds. 62

369

A comparison of our data with theoretical 18 O isotope effects for 1O2 reactions is thus not

370

possible. Regardless of the limited availability of theoretical isotope effect data for compar-

371

ison, the reaction mechanisms leading to the oxygenation of the studied probe compounds

372

with 1O2 are more complicated than the single rate-limiting step assumed here and a likely

373

source of AKIE variability.

374

Conclusions

375

Our data show that photochemical O2 consumption through pathways involving 1O2 can

376

lead to significant O isotope fractionation that originates from oxygenation reactions of

377

organic compounds with 1O2 . In surface waters, such compounds are present as reactive

378

structural moieties of DOM. The magnitude of isotope fractionation of dissolved O2 will

379

thus dependent on the concentration, type, and accessibility of reactive DOM moieties. At

380

high concentrations of DOM or 1O2 -reactive moieties therein, we expect a similar masking

381

of O kinetic isotope effects through fast reactions of 1O2 that would result in only neglible,

382

observable O isotope fractionation of dissolved O2 . With decreasing concentrations of reac-

tive functional groups, 18 O-ϵ values of dissolved O2 will increase to up to −27h to −30h

384

once the concentration of furan, imidazole, phenol, and sulfide moieties become kinetically

385

limiting. This increase in O isotope fractionation of dissolved O2 is caused by a shift in the

386

rate-limiting step of the overall reaction from the formation of 1O2 (no isotope fractionation)

387

to the oxygenation and eletron transfer reaction between 1O2 and organic moieties.

388

In natural aquatic systems, the most abundant 1O2 -reactive functional group are phenols

389

with concentrations in terrestrial dissolved organic matter of 2 − 4 mmol g−1 C. 63 With

390

typical dissolved organic carbon concentrations of 0.5 − 3 mg L−1 for oceans and 0.5 − 50 mg

391

L−1 for lakes and rivers, 64 total phenol concentrations range between 1 and 200 µM. Even

392

though 200 µM is the lowest phenol concentration used in this study, photochemical O2

393

consumption through 1O2 formation will only be relevant at elevated phenol concentrations.

394

Therefore, isotope fractionation associated with photochemical O2 consumption due to 1O2

395

formation can be expected to be close to the −24h determined with 200 µM tyrosine. Con-

396

sequently, isotope fractionation of photochemical O2 consumption through 1O2 formation

397

differs from isotope fractionation of respiration. This comparison implies that photochemi-

398

cal O2 consumption should be integrated as part of the assessment of gross photosynthetic

399

O2 production and net community O2 production through the evaluation of (triple) oxygen

400

isotope fractionation of O2 . Before doing so, however, the isotope fractionation of additional

401

photochemical consumption pathways also need to be assessed. This becomes particularly

402

obvious when comparing the range of isotope fractionation determined in this study for 1O2

403

formation specifically (0h to −30h) and previously for overall photochemical O2 consump-

404

tion (−8h to −10h). 32,33 This comparison suggests that 1O2 formation might not be the

405

dominant pathway for photochemical O2 consumption in complex CDOM mixtures.
