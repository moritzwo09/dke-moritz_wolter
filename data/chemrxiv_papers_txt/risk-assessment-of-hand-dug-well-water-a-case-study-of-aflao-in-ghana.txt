ABSTRACT

Peri-urban and rural areas in developing countries like Ghana face challenges with access to quality potable water due
to increasing groundwater contamination risks. This study assessed the risk of hand-dug well (HDW) water in Aflao
using a cross-sectional survey of 400 wells based on WHO sanitary inspection checklists.Water samples from 20 wells
were analysed for microbial contamination and heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, As) using membrane filtration and
Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Results revealed that 37.3% of wells were within 10 meters of latrines, 98% lacked
concrete floors, 98.3% lacked covers, 88.5% had poor drainage, 31.8% were under trees, and all were shallow (<30m).
Microbial loads exceeded WHO guidelines(0 cfu/100ml): total coliforms (579.7 ± 294.9 CFU/100 ml), faecal
coliforms (32.6 ± 54.7 CFU/100 ml), and E. coli (14.7 ± 21.7 CFU/100 ml) were detected in all samples.Sanitary risk
factors, including latrine proximity, absence of covers, poor drainage, and shallow depth, were significantly associated
with microbial contamination (p<0.05; OR>1) . Heavy metals were below detection limits (0.001–0.01 mg/l). Poor
microbial quality and its association with sanitary risks confirmed that HDWs in Aflao are unsafe for consumption
without treatment.

Keywords: Contamination, groundwater, hand-dug wells, health risk assessment, sanitary inspection.

INTRODUCTION
High population growth, rapid economic development, and urbanization have exerted significant pressure, particularly
in developing countries, on the inadequate conventional piped water supply systems (Amin et al., 2019). As a result,
millions of people are left behind without access to safe water services, making them vulnerable to a range of
preventable illnesses affecting the quality of life and also undermining the fundamental human rights to safe water for
economic development (WHO, 2023). Nearly 2 million deaths and 123 million disability-adjusted life years are linked
to inadequate access to safe water, and 2 billion global population lack access to safe and reliable sources of water
(WHO, 2023). This pressing global issue of water accessibility is more pronounced in developing countries, especially
in Sub-Saharan Africa (Ogunbode et al., 2024).
The coping strategies with inadequate formal and/ or conventional piped water systems in communities in developing
countries are reliance on groundwater sources through developing boreholes and hand-dug wells (HDWs) (Cid
Escobar, 2024). Boreholes are typically deeper and better protected and therefore are generally regarded as safer
options (Rauf et al., 2021). Most HDWs are unprotected wells and are considered unsuitable for consumption due to
the high risk of contamination from surface runoff, nearby sanitation facilities, and other environmental factors (Addo
et al., 2023; Kupa et al., 2024). Despite these safety concerns, many areas continue to rely on HDWs as a primary
water source because of their affordability, ease of construction, and lack of access to more secure alternatives like
boreholes or treated piped water systems (Malinga and Hashe, 2024). In many developing countries, HDWs serve as
essential water sources, particularly in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia (Zhang et al., 2020).
According to the Ghana Statistical Service (2021), 12% of the Ghanaian population relies on unprotected HDWs for
their water needs.The Ghana National Water Policy recognises access to safe water as a basic human right including
protection of unprotected sources like HDWs (Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources,2024). The policy also
mandates water safety measures such as integration into national planning, regularly prepare and review national and
Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) plans, promote practices that protect critical natural resources and
prevent irreversible ecological damage and the "polluter pays" principle to address ground and surface water
contamination, ensuring equitable access and inclusive management for all, especially marginalized groups.
Most Ghanaian HDWs are unprotected with significant risk of environmental contamination (Addo et al., 2023). For
instance, the absence of centralized wastewater treatment systems in many towns and communities has led to the

proliferation of private on-site sanitation facilities (Asumadu et al., 2023). These cluster of sanitation facilities pose a
significant risk of contaminating groundwater through the infiltration of wastewater with contaminants like pathogens,
heavy metals and others (Addo et al., 2023). Evaluating the microbial and physicochemical quality of HDWs is crucial
because it provides insights into the risk associated with harmful contaminants that are threat to public health
(Kushwah and Singh, 2024). HDWs could pose significant health risk mostly because they are highly susceptible to
microbial and chemical contamination (Xue et al., 2020), Yet, there are inadequate studies in Ghana on the risk
associated with HDW water sources especially in larger towns especially where such wells serve as the main water
supply sources.
Afloa, one of the busy border towns in Ghana within the Ketu-South Municipality main water source is HDW
(Amoako et al., 2023). There is limited information like in other towns on the risk associated with the HDW water
sources. This study therefore assessed the risk of the HDW water source in Aflao to provide an understanding of
sanitary risk factors using the World Health Organization (WHO) observation checklist.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Area
Ketu-South Municipal is a low-lying area that ranges in elevation from 66 metres inland to less than 15 metres close
to the coast. The coast is smooth and dotted with sandbars. The municipality's drainage system is dominated by
seasonal streams and flows southward to Aflao (Babanawo et al., 2022). The average annual precipitation is 850
millimetres at the coast and 1,000 millimetres inland, with a double rainfall peak from April to July and September to
October. The dry season, from December to February, is marked by harmattan winds. Rainfall during the minor season
is low and unpredictable, particularly between Agbozume and Aflao (Babanawo et al., 2022). The hydrogeology
includes recent and tertiary formations of unconsolidated sands and clays, as well as partially consolidated red
continental deposits of sandy clay and gravel. Beneath newer coastal sediments lies a thick layer of marine sands,
clay, shale, limestone, sandstone, and some gravel (Amoako et al., 2023).
In addition to its unique terrain, Aflao was chosen for this study because it is one of the busy large towns in Ghana
with majority of its population (70%) relying heavily on hand-dug wells (HDWs) (GSS, 2021) due to persistent
challenges with public water supply.

Sampling and Data Collection
The study used a cross-sectional survey approach. The World Health Organization (WHO) checklist was used for the
Sanitary Risk Assessment (SRA) of the HDWs, along with laboratory analyses of water samples from HDWs.
Given a total of 6,046 HDWs, a sample size of 375 was determined using Yamane (1973 ) simplified sampling
formula (Equation 1 below) with the assumptions of 95% confidence level, 5% desired level of precision, and 50%
maximum variability (Israel, 1992). However, the sample size was approximated to 400 for improvement in reducing
sample error (Etikan and Babtope, 2019). This formula was adapted as HDWs were considered as human population.
Hence 400 samples were obtained and equally distributed (100 samples each) to four zones in the Aflao community
for the SRA. Additionally, the study purposively collected 20 water samples from 5 HDWs samples from the four
zones with the selection criteria based on the location as: (1) Two wells from water-prone areas, and (2) three wells
from dry-up land areas. Waterlogged areas tend to have higher risks of contamination due to stagnation and surface
runoff, while dry-up land areas are more susceptible to groundwater depletion and potential concentrations of

contaminants (Zhao et al., 2024). The decision of considering higher number of wells in the dry-up area was based
on the high number of wells, sanitary risk factors like household/public toilet, and refuse dump in that areas than the
waterlogged area.This selection allows for a comparative analysis of water quality under varying environmental
conditions, providing a broader understanding of potential contamination sources and risks.

Sanitary inspections
A sanitary risk survey was conducted to determine the sanitary risk factors of 400 hand-dug wells in Aflao, using
WHO guidelines which involved identifying potential factors and sources of contamination. The sanitary inspection
technique was adopted from the WHO Guide for Drinking Water Quality standard having a systematic checklist of a
small number of specific inquiries (WHO, 2024). This checklist addressed the 10 most fundamental potential sources
and factors of well water contamination.

Water sample collection and Laboratory analyses
Water sample collection
Water samples were collected from 20 HDWs using 500 ml sterilized plastic bottles and transported to the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) -Water Research Institute laboratory in Accra within 24 hours under a
controlled temperature of 4°C in an ice-chest box during transportation following the protocol in APHA (1989).
Heavy metal analysis
Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) (Table 1) was employed to determine the concentration of metals (Lead [Pb],
Cadmium [Cd], Chromium [Cr], Nickel [Ni], and Arsenic [As]) by using the protocol of APHA (1989). Sample
solution was aspirated into flame and atomized. Through the flame, a light beam was focused, passing through a
monochromator and onto a detector that determined how much light the flame absorbed. Since each metal has its
characteristic absorption wavelength, a source lamp composed of that metal was used. The amount of energy at the
characteristic wavelength of 279.5nm absorbed in the flame was proportional to the concentration of the element in
the sample over a limited concentration range.

Microbial analysis
Membrane filtration was used, employing a sterile 0.45µm Millipore filter, Erlenmeyer flask, and vacuum source.
Samples were filtered and placed on selective media, including Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD) Agar for Shigella
and Salmonella, M-FC for faecal coliforms (FC), total coliforms (TC) and Hi-Chrome agar for E. coli, all in separate
Petri dishes. Incubation occurred at 37±2 °C for 18-24 hours for the analysis. Clamps and forceps were sterilized
before each use. All these procedures and techniques followed the APHA Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater (APHA, 1989).
Data analysis
Following Viban et al. (2021), regression analysis was used to examine the link between detected organisms and
observed risk factors/sources, specifically utilizing the beta Poisson model. In our approach, 'No' responses to sanitary
risk factors were assigned “absence of a risk factor” and taken as the reference categories in the statistical analysis,
allowing for a comparison with the 'Yes' responses, which indicated the presence of a risk factor. This involved the
use of odds ratios (OR) and a 0.05 significance level. As demonstrated by Viban et al. (2021), an OR below one
suggested no significant difference between contamination and observed risk factors. Conversely, an OR exceeding
one indicates an association with the specific risk factor under consideration, while an OR of one implies no discernible
difference between contamination and observed factors. Sanitary Risk Assessment (SRA) was obtained through the
adoption of the WHO SRA checklist for well water. Household scores 9-10 risk factors indicate a "very high risk,"
while 6-8 signifies "high risk," 3-5 denotes "moderate risk, "1-2 suggests "low risk," and 0 “no risk”.The statistical
tool employed for the analysis was Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 27.

Health risk assessment for heavy metals (HMs) involves the use of guideline limits, and models such as Hazard
Quotient (HQ), Hazard Index (HI), and the Lifetime Cancer Risk (LCR) model for carcinogenic risks. The HQ
evaluates non-carcinogenic effects and HI which is the sum of all HQ values for different metals, provides a
cumulative risk assessment with values below “1” indicating no significant risk. If the HI value is less than 1, there is
no significant risk of combined health effects (Balogun et al., 2023). The LCR model estimates the probability of
developing cancer over a lifetime due to exposure to metals like As, Cd, Cr, and Ni.

RESULTS
Household characteristic
The surveyed population, comprised of 400 respondents, exhibited a diverse demographic profile with an average age
of 46 and a gender distribution of 76% females and 24% males. Education levels varied, ranging from 38% with no
formal education to 3% attaining tertiary education. Employment diversity was notable, with 31% not employed,
including about 7% retirees, 61% self-employed predominantly traders, and 8% in government positions. The average
household size was 3, and residents had, on average, lived in the community for 20 years, occupying houses with an
average size of 9 people. All the assessed wells were privately owned by households and fully depended on for their
domestic and drinking purposes.
Sanitary Risk Assessment (SRA)
The results of the SRA conducted on 400 hand-dug wells are presented in Table 2. The findings indicate that several
sanitary risk factors were widespread and needed to be addressed. The absence of a concrete floor around wells was
noted in 94.5% of cases, while shallow well depths of less than 30 metres and the incorrect handling of ropes and
buckets were present in all wells studied (100%). Also, the absence of covers for wells was documented in 98.25% of
wells, and insufficient drainage systems were noted in 88.5% of wells. These factors, due to their high prevalence,
represent critical areas requiring urgent intervention to ensure the safety of water from these wells. However, some
sanitary risk factors, while less prevalent, still pose significant concerns and should not be overlooked. The presence
of latrines within 10 metres of the wells was identified in 37.3% of the wells, and 20.8% were located below latrines
positioned on higher ground. Wells surrounded by animal excreta or rubbish within a 10-metre radius accounted for
35.3% of the total, and 31.8% were located near or under trees, which may contribute to organic debris and animal
droppings entering the water. Inadequate construction of well headwalls, observed in 7.8% of cases, represents a less

common but concerning issue that may allow surface water to contaminate the wells. While all the factors assessed
permit attention to reduce contamination risks, it is evident that issues such as the absence of concrete floors, shallow
well depths, improperly handled ropes and buckets, absence of covers, and poor drainage systems should be prioritized
due to their higher prevalence and immediate threat to water quality. Factors with lower prevalence, such as proximity
to latrines, trees, or rubbish, and inadequate headwalls, though less urgent, remain essential to address for long-term
water safety improvements.

Sanitary Risk Scoring (SRS)
The SRS revealed a significant proportion of wells falling into higher-risk categories. Specifically, 2% of the wells
were classified as very high risk, while 71% were categorised as high risk, collectively accounting for 73% of the
wells (Figure 2). This result indicated that nearly three-quarters of the wells were at substantial risk of contamination,

emphasising a critical need for targeted interventions. The remaining 27% of the wells fell into the moderately risky

Observed sanitary risk factors versus microbial loads
The mean concentration of total coliform was 579.7.00 CFU/100ml with a standard deviation (SD) of 294.9
CFU/100ml, indicating considerable variability among the samples. Faecal coliform had a mean of 32.6 CFU/100ml
and a SD of 54.7 CFU/100ml, while E. coli recorded a mean concentration of 14.7 CFU/100ml with a SD of 21.7
CFU/100ml. Salmonella and Shigella were absent in all the samples (Table 4). The proximity of latrines within 10
metres of a well, areas prone to flooding, and public toilet areas, as well as wells located under trees, wells designated
for public use, latrines situated uphill from wells, the practice of digging and burying faeces within households, and
the absence of proper drainage and well covers were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with increased levels of
microbial contamination (Table 3). However, the presence of animal droppings did not show a significant association
with contaminant levels (p > 0.5), nor did the presence of public toilets correlate with TC levels. Similarly, the absence
of well covers, flood-prone areas concerning E. coli, and the practice of digging and burying faeces of E. coli were
not significantly associated with contamination.
Key risk factors with higher OR (OR > 1) indicating a strong association with contamination included the presence of
latrines within 10 metres of a well (average distance between 8 households with septic tank toilets and observed well
water was 6m, with 10 to 11m), which showed significantly increased odds for faecal coliforms (OR = 5.620,

CI=4.114-7.678), total coliforms (OR = 1.247, CI=1.183-1.313), and E. coli (OR = 2.699, CI=1.799-4.051)
contamination. Wells located under trees were also strongly associated with contamination, with OR and CI values of
1.890 and 1.220-2.928 for faecal coliforms and 2.806 and 1.524-5.168 for E. coli. Additionally, wells designated for
public use showed 2.516 times more likely to contaminate the well water with FC and 3.591 for E. coli. Latrines
situated uphill from wells exhibited increased odds of contamination with OR values of 3.034 for FC and 1.710 for E.
coli. The absence of a fence, cover, apron and shallow well with an average of depth 3.84m and water levels at 3.35
exhibited constant outcomes, with all observations and measurements consistently yielding the same result (risk factor
observed). This implies that observed factors did not exhibit variation or fluctuation within the dataset. The
unidirectional skewness of these constant observations and measurements suggests a lack of diversity or meaningful
variability in the specific attributes assessed within the studied population as indicated in dash (-) in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
Microbial and chemical contamination of groundwater sources is a documented issue globally, often linked to poor
sanitary conditions around sources (Amoako et al., 2023 ; Baia et al., 2022). Consistent with our findings, Anang et
al. (2023) in Ghana observed significant microbial contamination levels in wells situated near sanitation facilities in
a community. Similar patterns have been reported in China, where proximity to sanitation facilities emerged as a
significant risk factor for contamination (Xue et al., 2020). In contrast, studies in Southeast Asia (Cao et al., 2021)
reported lower contamination levels, likely reflecting differences in well-protection measures and sanitation
infrastructure. These variations highlight the influence of regional factors such as hydrogeology, sanitation practices,
and community behaviour on groundwater contamination.

The high frequency of microbial contamination of HDWs in the current study can be attributed to various factors,
including environmental conditions and infrastructure limitations. Key predictors include the proximity of wells to
latrines, lack of concrete floors and well covers, insufficient drainage systems, and the placement of wells under trees
(Xue et al., 2020). These factors significantly (p < 0.05, OR > 1) increase contamination risks, as evidenced by the
high levels of total coliform (mean=579.7), faecal coliform (maen=32.6), and E. coli (14.7) observed in this study
(Table 3). Similar findings were reported by Anang et al. (2023), who linked faecal contamination in peri-urban Ghana
to inadequate separation between sanitation facilities and water sources.

Cultural and environmental sanitation practices also influence contamination risks. In peri-urban communities
characterized by slums or informal settlements, maintaining regulatory distances between wells and sanitation
facilities is challenging due to limited space, hydrogeological variability, and cultural norms (Oyeniyi, 2020;

15

Bhallamudi et al., 2019). These challenges are compounded by poor maintenance of sanitation systems, as argued by
Jenifer and Jha (2022) in India, where design flaws and substandard maintenance exacerbated groundwater
contamination, regardless of proximity (Othoo et al., 2020).

The findings of this study aligned with several local investigations on HDW contamination in Ghana and global. For
instance, Yousuf et al. (2021) identified poor sanitary conditions as a key driver of microbial contamination in wells
across peri-urban US, consistent with our finding of high mean score of TC (579.7.00 CFU/100ml), FC (32.6
CFU/100ml), and E.coli (14.7 CFU/100ml) (Table 4) contamination. Similar to our findings, Houéménou et al. (2020)
reported significant contamination in wells located near latrines and septic systems, suggesting a shared challenge of
inadequate separation between water sources and sanitation facilities. In agreement with this study, Lutterodt et al.
(2018) found that microbial contamination in HDWs was often linked to effluent seepage from on-site sanitation
systems, particularly in densely populated areas. This underscores the difficulty of maintaining regulatory distances
in communities with limited land availability and poor spatial planning.

This study also discovered additional risk factors, such as the placement of wells under trees and the lack of well
covers and concrete floor, shallow well and high water tables which may influence contamination of HDWs. These
structural deficiencies are often overlooked in local studies but are critical for addressing water safety concerns
(Braimah et al., 2021). Furthermore, seasonal factors such as heavy rainfall worsen contamination risks. Floods during
the rainy season easily contributes to contamination through leaching of contaminants, as documented by Cao et al.
(2021), and this effect was further supported by Nascimento Santos et al. (2023), who observed a significant (p <
0.05) link between rainfall intensity and microbial contamination in well water samples.

In Senegal, Pouye et al. (2023) discovered that frequent rain can transport contaminants over greater distances than
typically expected, undermining recommended safety distances for well placement. This observation defines the
findings of this study, where wells located distance from sanitation facilities still exhibited significant contamination
possibly due to structural deficiencies identified in Aflao, such as the lack of concrete floors, the absence of cover and
wells under trees. Therefore, well design and maintenance are important in controlling contamination (Jenifer and Jha,
2022). Furthermore, Olalemi, (2021) study in Nigeria found that the absence of Salmonella and Shigella in well water,
despite the presence of E. coli, could be attributed to differences in contamination sources, microbial communities, or

16

environmental conditions. This aligns with our study as indicated oganisms (Salmonella and Shigella) were absent in
analysed well water samples (Table 4).

An observation pertained to the deployment of standard well lining and parapet walls at all sample points, functioning
as an effective barrier mechanism that delineated a protective interface between HDW water and potential
contaminants originating from surface runoff (Okoye et al., 2023). Furthermore, this observation holds significance
in the context of environmental hygiene, particularly given that the majority of these wells were typically situated
within household premises and most houses owned a well which might reduce the risk of contamination from
neighbours (Othoo et al., 2023).
The hydrogeological context has a key impact on the low detection limits of HMs recorded in the HDWs (Hao et al.,
2024). Hydrogeological environments including recent and tertiary formations characterized by unconsolidated sands
and clays, marine sands, and partially consolidated red continental deposits affect the prevalence of HMs in well water.
These have significant adsorption capabilities for heavy metals, allowing them to retain metals in the soil and diminish
their concentrations in groundwater (Bai et al., 2024). Coastal and riverine deposits influence groundwater recharge
rates (Chmielarski et al., 2024). High recharge rates in river valleys and coastal regions can contribute to the diffusion
of contaminants, contributing to reduced concentrations of HMs in the wells (Birla et al., 2020).
In some cases, HM contamination tends to come from natural mineral deposits located in deeper geological layers
(Liu et al., 2024). Metals like As, Pb, and Cd may come from mineral-rich bedrock, but since HDWs do not reach
these deep layers, they are less likely to locate water that has been in contact with such minerals (Richard et al., 2024).
Groundwater flow through loosely consolidated sands and clays tends to be slower, allowing for higher contact with
the soil matrix and enhanced possibility for metal attenuation (Wang et al., 2021). Additionally, the passage through
marine clays and sands may promote the natural dilution of contaminants, resulting in lower detectable levels (Rahman
et al., 2013).
The presence of industrial or anthropogenic activities near the wells or other water sources adds to HMs contamination
through storm runoff and also geological features are identified as contributors to low HMs levels, with regions
naturally low in metal concentrations yielding water with minimal contamination (Kapoor and Singh, 2021).
Therefore, the absence of industrial activity could be a potential factor in the low detection limit of targeted HMs in
the samples result of the recent study.

CONCLUSION
This study assessed the risk of HDW water in Aflao. The results discovered that all 20 wells tested were contaminated
with total coliform (mean=579.7.00 CFU/100ml), and E.coli (14.7 CFU/100ml), and 18 wells contained faecal
coliform (mean=32.6 CFU/100ml) and E. coli (mean=14.7 CFU/100ml), making the water unsafe for consumption by
WHO standards (0 cfu/100ml). Although heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, and As) were below minimum detection limits
(0.001–0.01 mg/L), there was a strong association (p<0.05) between sanitary risk factors such as proximity to latrines,
lack of concrete floors and covers, poor drainage, trees near wells, and shallow depth and microbial contamination.
These findings recommend the need for better sanitation, replacement of components of the wells, education and
promotion of well water treatment and hygiene to reduce contamination risks and safeguard public health in Aflao.
Limitations of the study
The findings are limited to the few numbers of purposively selected hand-dug well water samples which could be only
indicative of samples taken given the potential biases with purposive sampling although selection criteria were
defined. Also, seasonal variations (wet/rainy and dry) were not considered in the study design.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATION
