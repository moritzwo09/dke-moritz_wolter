We studied selenium (Se) sequestration in minimally disturbed lacustrine sediments using
flow-through reactors (FTR) in response to organic matter lability, selenium (Se)
speciation and temperature (4 and 23°C). Initial sediment was composed of either fresh or
aged organic matter (OM), and was fed with environmentally relevant, low Se
concentrations and filtered lake water. We monitored Se concentration as well as
speciation along with pH and the concentrations of dissolved OM, NO3-, NO2-, Fe(II),
SO42- and HS- in the outflow of FTRs during 8 experimental phases along increasing Se
concentrations. All experiments sequestered a large proportion of Se. Fresh, labile OM
removed 50% more Se than aged, more recalcitrant OM. Along with a highest proportion
of reduced redox-sensitive species in the reactors with fresh OM, this result is consistent
with reducing conditions promoting Se sequestration. Inflowing selenite was sequestered
to a larger extent than inflowing selenate. Lastly, only selenate reduction responded
strongly to temperature. At 100 nM inflow, selenate was sequestered at a rate of 92 pmol
cm-3 d-1 at 23°C, which lowered to 80 pmol cm-3 d-1 at 4°C. Outflow Se speciation for
selenate reduction experiments comprised mostly of organic Se species at 23°C and, in
contrast, solely of selenate at 4°C. We hypothesize that selenate reduction proceeded via
microbial processes, in line with reactions catalyzed by enzymes being temperature
dependent. Overall, our findings suggest that the mobilisation and warming of the boreal
and permafrost carbon pools may increase the capacity of aquatic environments to
sequester Se, lowering its bioavailability.

Introduction

46

Selenium is an essential micronutrient that has a narrow window of concentration between

47

deficiency and toxicity (Hatfield et al. 2016). In surface waters, Se transfer to the food web

48

is strongly influenced by sediment–water interactions (Martin et al. 2022), where sediments

49

can be either sources or sinks of Se depending on the complex interplay between organic

50

carbon lability, major redox, and microbially-mediated pathways (Laberge-Carignan et al.

51

2024). Freshwater sediments and water-logged soils are key features of cold-region

52

landscapes worldwide. They are ubiquitous in vast expanses of the boreal (14 % of the land

53

surface) and permafrost (11 % of the land surface) landscapes, as well as in large

54

proportions of temperate ecoregions. Such wetlands, lakes and river systems are underlain

55

by sediments that experience seasonal cooling under the influence of 4°C water which sinks

56

and accumulate at the sediment-water interface throughout the cold season (Jones et al.

57

2024).

58

Seasonally alternating temperatures, organic matter (OM) and dissolved oxygen (DO)

59

concentrations thus form the basis of hydrogeochemical and ambient redox conditions that

60

impact Se speciation and mobility. Se is a redox sensitive element with four different redox

61

states naturally found in the environment, -2, 0, +4 and +6 (Winkel et al. 2012). Selenate

62

(SeO42-), the oxyanion of Se(VI), is the most mobile Se species and the main species in

63

oxic conditions (Sharma et al. 2015). Selenite (HSeO3- or SeO32-), the oxyanion of Se(IV),

64

has a stronger affinity for adsorption onto clays and metal oxides such as ferrihydrite and

65

gibbsite, onto which it form inner-sphere complexes (Deen et al. 2022; Fernández-Martínez

66

& Charlet 2009; Goberna-Ferron et al. 2021). Selenite also as a stronger binding affinity

67

than selenate for dissolved organic matter, which provides a pathway for its sequestration

68

in sediment (Dalai et al. 2023; Sharma et al. 2015). Se species can adsorb onto pyrite, which

69

leads to the reduction of selenate to selenite at the mineral’s surface (Guida et al. 2023) and

70

the reduction of selenite to Se0(s) (Deen et al. 2022; Mitchell et al. 2013). Pyrite yields

71

higher selenite reduction rates compared to siderite and sphalerite (Deen et al. 2022),

72

making it an important reactive surface in abiotic Se reduction (Guida et al. 2023).

73

Ultimately, both selenate and selenite can be reduced to poorly soluble elemental Se0(s).

74

Collectively, the above-mentioned abiotic processes, which are considered to be at

75

equilibrium, can nevertheless be hindered by dissolved OM (DOM) acting as a ligand, as

76

previously shown for arsenic (As) adsorption onto Fe oxides (Couture et al. 2010).

77

OM is thus a key factor controlling Se speciation and mobility (Dalai et al. 2023;

78

Gustafsson & Johnsson 1992), both as a ligand and as an electron donor during the

79

sequential utilization of terminal electron acceptors. OM presenting a greater proportion of

80

labile moieties such as polysaccharides, proteins, organic acids, fatty acids (Poirier et al.

81

2005) will establish microbial activity to along the redox gradient (LaRowe & Van

82

Cappellen 2011), promoting electron transfer (Borch et al. 2010; Paredez et al. 2017).

83

Given that microbial processes proceed via enzymatic reactions, their rate is constrained

84

by temperature (Davidson et al. 2006; Nielsen et al. 2019). OM oxidation progressively

85

leaves more recalcitrant OM, that can act as a ligand and complex dissolved Se (Gustafsson

86

& Johnsson 1994; Li et al. 2017). In waterlogged soil and sediment, redox stratification

87

responds to the availability of OM that is labile towards microbial oxidation (Vincent et al.

88

2024). Several mechanisms, often simultaneous, account for the interactions between Se

89

and OM. These include microbial uptake and transformation (Luo et al. 2022), direct or

90

indirect complexation (Martin et al. 2022; Sharma et al. 2015), and Se reduction under

91

anoxic conditions, which are controlled by OM and temperature (Li et al. 2017; Nielsen et

92

al. 2019; Tolu et al. 2014). Ultimately, biotic selenate and selenite reduction proceeds via

93

either dissimilatory reduction to poorly soluble Se0(s) (Martin et al. 2011; Schilling et al.

94

2018), or assimilatory reduction to organo-Se, which is essential for life (Hatfield et al.

95

2016; Sharma et al. 2015).

96

The fate of Se in cold region is a concern in aquatic environments (Laberge-Carignan et al.

97

2024), agricultural settings (Pi et al. 2023), and under the influence of anthropogenic

98

activities such as coal combustion (Cooke et al. 2024). Nevertheless, and despite cold-

99

region being inherently characterised by 4°C water during the cold season, data on

100

sediment Se dynamics are generally reported at growing season (e.g., room) temperature.

101

It is likely that warmer temperature will affect the sediment’s capacity to retain Se by

102

enhancing microbially favorable pathways (Wells & Stolz 2020), the dissolved organic

103

matter (DOM) composition and concentration (Porcal et al. 2015), the kinetics of chemical

104

reaction (Davidson et al. 2006), and the solubility of dissolved oxygen (DO) (Schladow et

105

al. 2002).

106

In addition, a wide array of Se reduction rates are obtained from microbial pure culture

107

experiments (Kausch et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2022; Yan et al. 2020), or sterile batch

108

experiments (Dalai et al. 2023; Goberna-Ferron et al. 2021; Guida et al. 2023; López-Toyos

109

et al. 2023), under conditions far from those prevailing in the field. Such experiments result

110

in an artificially high reaction rates given the high supply of substrates for enzymatic

111

reactions (Schilling et al. 2019; Schilling et al. 2018). Thus, there exists knowledge gap on

112

the rate of Se sequestration at cold temperature in environmentally relevant conditions.

113

Here, we aim to fill this gap and provide a first estimate of the temperature control on Se

114

sequestration under such environmentally relevant conditions, specifically: i) low, nM Se

115

concentrations, ii) minimally disturbed sediment which preserves the microbial niches

116

(Pallud et al. 2007; Pi et al. 2023) and iii) under both cold (4°C) and warm (23°C)

117

conditions. This will allow a realistic estimate of the in situ apparent Se reaction rate,

118

relevant for the field (Schilling et al. 2018). Further to cold and warm comparison, we also

119

compared the role of OM lability as well as the behavior of both selenate and selenite as

120

Se species fed to the FTRs. The former was achieved by selected initial sediment with

121

abundant labile (i.e., fresh) organic carbon supplied with dissolved oxygen, and sediment

122

with recalcitrant (i.e., aged) carbon under anoxic conditions, while the latter was achieved

123

by adding either selenate or selenite to the input solutions and performing Se speciation

124

measurements in the outflow. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report of naturally

125

occurring Se reduction rate at both 4 and 23°C, two environmentally relevant end member

126

of cold-region temperature.

127

Materials and Methods

128

Field site

129

The sediments used in the FTRs were sampled from the deepest point (21 m) of Lake

130

Tantaré (47°04′15′′ N, 71°33′42′′ W). This dimictic freshwater headwater oligotrophic lake

131

is located in an ecological reserve, 38 km northwest of Quebec City. The lake drainage

132

basin has never been inhabited and is dominated by ferrohumic podzols (Liu et al. 2015).

133

Human activity impacts on the lake are solely from atmospheric deposition (Couture et al.

134

2008). The sampling site is characterized by seasonal anoxia at the sediment–water

135

interface in late summer, 4°C hypolimnetic water, a pH around 5.6 and dissolved organic

136

carbon (DOC) concentrations between 2.2 and 2.7 mg L-1(Couture et al. 2008; Fortin et al.

137

1993; Joshani et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2015).

138

The sediment mass accumulation rate was 10.8 mg cm-2 yr-1 at the sampling site (Couture

139

et al. 2008). Previous studies have shown that the composition (Joshani et al. 2024) and

140

lability (Couture et al. 2010) of sedimentary OM vary with depth, where the surface OM

141

being more labile (Fig. 1b). A large proportion of the sediment mineral phase is crystallized

142

lepidocrocite (Fortin et al. 1993). At the sampling site, both the solid-phase and porewater

143

concentration of Fe and trace elements are relatively constant with depth (Couture et al.

144

2008).

145

Sediment and Porewater Sampling.

146

A first core was retrieved in September 2020 with a 9 cm diameter gravity corer equipped

147

with a core catcher (Uwitec, Austria) using a pre-drilled tube. This core was only used to

148

withdrawn sediment porewater every cm from the sediment-water interface down to 10 cm

149

depth using Rhizon samplers (Rhizosphere, Wageningen, Netherlands). The porewater was

150

delivered into acid-washed 15 mL conical tubes containing HNO3 (Aristar Ultra, VWR,

151

Canada) yielding a final sample concentration of 4% HNO3 for major and trace element

152

analysis. In June 2022, three more cores were retrieved at the same site. One core was

153

sliced every cm, freeze-dried and used as a sediment reference for initial conditions. The

154

two other cores were used to assemble the FTRs.

155

Flow-Through Reactor Experiments Setup

156

A Plexiglas® ring 2 cm high with a 4 cm internal diameter was inserted in the middle of a

157

sediment layer to retrieve the sediment with minimal disturbance. The ring was capped

158

with a 0.45 µm polyethersulfone membranes (VWR, Canada), a fiberglass backing filter

159

(Adventec MFS, Inc., Ireland) and finally a plastic cover with a hole that allows liquid to

160

circulate. The same assembly was then performed on the other side of the ring to

161

encapsulate the sediment within the FTR (Couture et al. 2008; Pallud et al. 2007). The

162

FTRs were assembled in the field immediately after sampling and kept at 4°C in the dark

163

until the start of the experiment.

164

Lake water was collected on the same day as the sediments, was filtered on a 0.45 µm

165

polyethersulfone membranes (VWR, Canada) and used as a matrix to prepare input

166

solutions. Inputs were spiked with Na2SeO4 (anhydrous, 99.8% metal basis, AlfaAesar,

167

Canada) for selenate or Na2SeO3 (anhydrous, 99% metal basis, AlfaAesar, Canada) for

168

selenite. Inputs were pumped through the FTR using a peristaltic pump (IPC, Ismatec,

169

Germany) at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ± 0.1 mL h-1, which represents one FTR volume

170

per day.

171

Pairs of FTRs (F and A) were placed in temperature-regulated bath (Refrigerated

172

circulating bath, Thermo SC100) and isolated from light. The baths were set to cold (4°C)

173

or warm (23°C) temperature, yielding 4 simultaneous FTR experiments. Each experiment

174

lasted through two experimental phases, which started after an acclimatization of 14 days.

175

The acclimatization phase was carried in the same conditions has the ones used for the

176

following phases of the experiment. The two phases impose selenate (SeO42-) or selenite

177

(HSeO3-) in the inflow (Table 1). At the end of the last phase, inflow Se concentrations

178

were increased to 2 µM with SeO42- in the F FTR and 2 µM with HSeO3- in the A FTR for

179

the last 10 days of the experiments.

183

Outflow solutions were collected using an automated fraction collector (Omnicoll,

184

LAMBDA, Czech Republic) and delivered directly into the appropriate vials containing

185

preservation reagents. Samples for major and trace element analyses were delivered into

186

acid-washed 15 mL conical tubes containing HNO3 (Aristar Ultra, VWR, Canada) yielding

187

a final sample concentration of 4% HNO3. Due to the possibility of Fe flocculation with

188

DOC in the sample, the Fe concentrations were also confirmed by the ferrozine method to

189

ensure the total recovery of Fe(II) (Li et al. 2024). Samples for Se speciation were delivered

190

using a needle directly into N2-purged vials, and those for sulfide analysis into an N2-

191

purged glass vials amended with Zn-acetate (Thermoscientific, USA). Finally, samples for

192

anion analysis were delivered to HDPE ion chromatography vials (Thermoscientific,

193

USA).

194

Instrumental analysis

195

The major and trace element concentrations in the outflow solutions were analyzed weekly.

196

Major elements (Na, Ca, Mg, K, S, Fe, Mn) were quantified by inductively coupled plasma

197

atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Thermo Scientific duo iCAP 7400) with iridium

198

(Ir) as an internal standard. Selenium (Se) concentrations were determined by ICP-MS/MS

199

(Agilent 8900, Agilent Canada) with rhodium (Rh) as an internal standard. To avoid

200

interference from 40Ar2+, we used O2 as a reaction gas and measured the polyatomic

201

78

202

the certified values for certified material TM-DWS.3 (Filtered Lake water, ECCC, Canada)

203

was less than 10 %.

204

Se speciation of the outflow solution was carried out by HPLC-ICP-MS/MS (Agilent

205

8900). Fifty µL of sample was eluted through a Hamilton PRP X-100 (4.1 mm × 250 mm,

206

10 μm) column with 10 mM of ammonium acetate, pH = 4.9 in MeOH 2% at 1 mL min-1

207

(Gao et al. 2018). 77Se was monitored with a 5 mL min-1 H2 flow in the reaction cell to

208

diminish interference. External calibration was performed between 0 and 5 µg L-1 for

209

SeO42- and HSeO3- (R2 > 0.999).

210

The difference between the total Se concentration obtained by ICP-MS/MS and the sum of

211

selenate and selenite concentrations is assumed to include undefined Se species. To

212

ascertain the nature of the Se species that covers of that difference, we have performed a

Se16O+ ion. For all measured elements, the difference between the measured (n = 5) and

8

213

UV oxidation test on a sample from the Warm-F FTR outflow (Chen et al. 2005), which

214

shown a quantitative increase in Se after oxidation of the sample. This strongly suggest that

215

the Se balance is organic, although we could not identify the structures of the compounds

216

prone to UV oxidation. Thus, the difference between the sum of the inorganic species

217

concentrations and the total Se concentration is understood to be undefined Organo-Se

218

species (Martin et al. 2011; Ponton & Hare 2013).

219

The fractions for anion (NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, S2O32-) analysis were collected at the beginning

220

and the end of each phase, except for the two phases of the Warm-F FTR for which we only

221

have one sample. Anions were measured by ion chromatography (Integrion IC,

222

ThermoFisher, USA) equipped with a AS11-HC column, with a detection limit below 0.1

223

µmol L-1 for all anions. HS- and Fe(II) were quantified by UV-VIS colorimetry (Aqualog,

224

HORIBA Scientific, USA) using the Cline (Cline 1969) and the ferrozine (Viollier et al.

225

2000) method, respectively. The detection limits was 0.7 µmol L-1 for HS- and 0.03 µmol

226

L-1 for Fe(II).

227

The effluent DOC quality was characterized by fluorescence excitation emission matrices

228

(EEM) on a spectrofluorometer (Aqualog, HORIBA Scientific, USA), at an excitation

229

range of 240–800 nm in steps of 5 nm, with an emission range of 240–800 nm in steps of

230

5 nm. The EEM spectra were used to calculate three optical indices: the fluorescence index

231

(FI), the freshness index (BIX) and the humification index (HIX) (Gabor et al. 2014; Ohno

232

2002; Shatilla & Carey 2019; Wilson & Xenopoulos 2009). Details on the calculation of

233

the different indices are provided elsewhere (Laberge-Carignan et al. 2024).

234

After the acquisition of EEM spectra, the samples were acidified with HCl to quantify

235

dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) using a Vario TOC-

236

Cube TOC analyzer (Elementar, Germany) coupled to a Horiba NOx analyzer (Horiba

237

Scientific, USA). The detection limits were 20 µM for DOC and 10 µM for TDN.

238

Sediments collected prior and after FTRs experiments were freeze-dried and ground with

239

an agate mortar and pestle. The sediments were mineralized by microwaves (Mars 5, CEM

240

Canada) with concentrated acid (trace metal, VWR, Canada) in Teflon vessel as detailed in

241

the supporting information (Lizotte et al. 2023). Each sample was mineralized in triplicate.

The major and trace elements were analyzed in the mineralized solutions as described

243

above.

244

Data Analysis

245

The selenate and selenite reduction rates (RSe_net; pmol cm-3 d-1) were calculated as:
R

246

(1)

_

247

Where: C0 (mol cm-3) is the inflow SeO42- or HSO3- concentration, Cout (mol cm-3) is the

248

outflow SeO42- or HSeO3- concentration as provided by Se speciation analysis, Q is the

249

inflow rate (cm-3 d-1) and V (cm-3) is the FTR volume (Pallud et al. 2007; Steinberg &

250

Oremland 1990). Dissolved Se efflux (J; mol L-1 d-1) was calculated by dividing the slope

251

(mol d-1) of the cumulative Se outflow concentration as a function of time by the volume

252

(cm3) of the reactor. The assumptions that both the one-dimensional flow and the

253

concentrations in the sediment slices are radially homogenous underpins the interpretation

254

the outflow data in terms of kinetic parameters (Pallud et al. 2007). This is reasonable

255

assumption given the features of the bromide breakthrough curves in such minimally

256

disturbed sediment (Couture et al. 2013).

257

In data interpretation, we focus on the net Se reaction rates, and do not evaluate the

258

maximum potential reduction rate or the half-saturation constant for enzymatic selenite and

259

selenate reactions. Because RSe_net is dependent on the C0 (Steinberg & Oremland 1990),

260

we calculate normalized rates (NRse_net; mol L-1 d-1) to enable comparison between

experiments with different inflow concentrations from the literature, using the following

Finally, the redox conditions prevailing in the FTRs were calculated based on theoretical

266

standard reduction potential values, measured pH and cations and anion concentrations as

267

well as the measured redox couples Fe3+/Fe2+, NO3-/NO2- and SO42-/HS-. All

Two sets of observations (Couture et al. 2008; Couture et al. 2010; Fortin et al. 1993;

280

Joshani et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2015), summarized in Table 2, were used to set experimental

281

conditions, in addition to the imposed FTR temperature. Firstly, dissolved Se increased

282

sharply below the sediment–water interface, then remained relatively stable throughout the

283

profile with in-situ porewater Se concentration within the nanomolar range, from 0.7 nM

284

at the sediment–water interface to a maximum of 1.2 nM at a depth of 4 cm in the sediment

285

(Fig. 1a).

286

Second, the lability (e.g, quality) of the OM was estimated via incubations that yielded OM

287

mineralization rates (Couture et al. 2010). OM degradation rates decreased from 465 µmol

288

cm-3 yr-1 below the sediment–water interface to lower than 80 µmol cm-3 yr-1 at 10 cm

290

OM oxidation potential (fresh labile OM, FTRs labeled F) and the 8–10 cm layer was

291

selected for FTRs with low OM oxidation potential (aged recalcitrant OM, FTRs labeled

293

than six years old and the aged recalcitrant OM around 50 years old (Couture et al. 2008).

Outflow Selenium Concentrations During FTR Experiments

302

Outflow Se concentrations reached various plateaus depending on the experiment (Fig. 2).

303

The highest values of 8–12 nM were reached within 2 days for the two cold FTRs with

304

selenate as inflow Se species. The two other selenate-fed FTRs and all the selenite-fed

305

FTRs had outflow Se concentrations between 0.7 and 4.5 nM, respectively, thus

306

sequestering more Se.

represent experiments with fresh OM (F) and darker colored triangles represent experiments with
aged OM (A), while solid and open symbols indicate respectively selenite and selenate as inflow
Se species.

313

For the warm FTRs fed with selenate, the majority of Se in the outflow solution was

314

comprised of these undefined Se species, with the balance composed of 20 % selenate and

315

10 % selenite, for example in the Warm-A FTR (Supplementary Information Figure S4,

316

S7). In contrast, inorganic Se species dominated the outflow Se speciation in the cold FTRs,

317

with mostly selenate being measured (Supplementary Information Figure S4). For the

318

experiments fed with selenite, the majority of Se in the outflow of all FTRs were undefined

319

organic-Se species (Supplementary Information Figure S6).

320

Normalized selenate and selenite reduction rates (NRSe_net; mol cm-3 d-1) were calculated

321

with the Se outflow concentration plateaus for each experiment that was fed with Se

322

concentrations in the nanomolar range (Eq. 2; Fig. 3a). For the experiments with selenate,

323

NRSe_net_6 values were similar for both warm FTRs at 0.095±1 nmol cm-3 d-1, and higher

324

than the values for the cold FTRs (0.063 nmol cm-3 d-1). For the experiments with selenite,

325

the calculated NRSe_net_4 values were similar for all FTRs, at 0.095±1 nmol cm-3 d-1.

2 µM (panel b). Blue and orange bars indicate cold (4°C) and warm (23°C) reactors, respectively,
while solid and hatched fill indicate selenite and selenate as inflow Se species, respectively.

331

Upon increasing the inflow Se concentration by 20-fold, selenate and selenite reduction

332

rates (RSe_net; nmol cm-3d-1) were calculated for each experiment (Equ. 1). The RSe_net_6

333

values were calculated in FTRs with fresh OM and the RSe_net_4 in the FTRs with aged OM.

334

Selenate rates (RSe_net_6) were lower than selenite rates (RSe_net_4). The cold reactors had

335

lower RSe_net than the warm reactors (Fig. 3b).

336

Effect of OM Lability on Se Reduction Rates and Ambient Redox Potential

337

The quality of dissolved OM leached from the reactor was assessed using DOC and TDN

338

analysis, as well as by measuring chromophoric properties of DOC to calculate the indices

339

described above. DOC was generally under 2 mM, with TDN an order of magnitude lower,

340

around 0.2 mM. The Cold-A reactor stood out, leaching up to 19 mM DOC and 2 mM

341

TDN. In general, inflow and outflow values of FI, BIX and HIX point to inflow and outflow

342

DOC being markedly different for the warm FTRs, and, in contrast, very similar for the

343

cold FTRs (Supplementary Information Figure S8 and S9).

344

Among the warm FTRs, the FTR with fresh OM leached DOC that was more terrestrial,

345

older and more humic compared to the FTR with aged OM, and to the initial solution.

346

These changes in chromophoric properties suggest microbial degradation of the labile

347

constituents of the sediment OM (Paredez et al. 2017). The remaining recalcitrant carbon

348

is leached out of the FTR, explaining the differences observed between the two warm

349

FTRs.

350

Fig. 4 displays the mean ratios of the key redox couples NO3/NO2, Fe(III)/Fe(II) and SO42-

351

/HS- in the reactor outflows. The experiments with fresh OM yielded systematically lower

352

ratios of oxidized to reduced species for the major redox couples than the experiments with

353

aged OM. Lower nitrate, sulfate, and iron(III) hydr(oxide) concentrations indicates redox

354

biogeochemical reactions involving microbial activities (Bethke et al. 2011; Borch et al.

355

2010). The PHREEQC-calculated Eh values are consistent with this, where Eh is more

356

reducing in the FTR with fresh OM and more oxidizing in the FTR with aged OM. For the

357

FTR with fresh OM the main electron acceptor is SO42- while Fe(III) is the main electron

358

acceptor in the FTR with aged OM.

364

Redox conditions affect the major redox couples and Se speciation, since microorganisms

365

can reduce selenate or selenite to less mobile species (Se0 (s), Se(-II)) (Tolu et al. 2014).

366

Among the warm FTRs, the one with fresh OM produced a lower proportion and

367

concentration of oxidized Se species compared to the FTR with aged OM (Supplementary

368

Information Figures S3-S6). The cumulative outflow Se plot (Supplementary Information

369

Figure S1) was used to determine the dissolved Se efflux (JSe; nmol L-1 d-1) for each

370

experiment (Supplementary Information Figure S2). The FTRs with fresh OM let through

371

less Se than the ones with aged OM, consistent with previous studies on the effect of OM

372

on Se sequestration (Calderone et al. 1990; Pi et al. 2023; Schilling et al. 2018; Tolu et al.

373

2014). In particular, Schilling et al. (2018) conducted FTR experiments to assess selenate

374

reduction rates at different sediment depths, and observed higher Rse_net_6 at the sediment–

375

water interface, which was associated with increased lability of OM, compared to deeper

376

sediments.

377

The Gibbs free energy yield for the oxidation half reaction of OM (ΔGC ox°) is more

378

negative for fresh OM than for aged OM (LaRowe & Van Cappellen 2011). Here, FTRs

379

where high free energy yield was expected due to the abundance of fresh OM and faster

380

experimentally-derived OM degradation rates (Couture et al. 2010) led to a wider range of

381

values for OM chromophoric properties (Supplementary Information Figure S9), lower

382

ratios of oxidized to reduced species for the major redox couples (Fig. 4), and lower Se

383

effluxes (Supplementary Information Figure S2).

384

Influence of Temperature on Se Reduction Rates

385

Based on the DOC chromophoric properties (Supplementary Information Figure S9), the

386

warm FTRs leached more terrestrial, old, and humic DOC compared to the inflow

387

solutions. The cold FTRs did not exhibit this behavior. This is probably the outcome of

388

enhanced enzymatic activity and OM decomposition under warmer conditions (Dick

389

2011). Similarly, the warm FTRs induced lower ratios of oxidized to reduced species for

390

the major redox couples (Fig. 4) regardless of the lability of OM, indicating greater

391

microbial activity.

392

Microbial reduction of selenate, which leads to Se removal via Se0(s) particulate formation

393

or incorporation into organic compounds (Fernández-Martínez & Charlet 2009), and Se

394

methylation are all known to be an enzymatic processes (Dick 2011). Increased

395

temperature increases kinetic energy, facilitating enzymatic reactions, particularly in

396

bacteria (Becker 1986; Davidson et al. 2006; Dick 2011). Microbial enzyme-catalyzed

397

reactions are thus temperature-dependent, and their rate can double with each 10°C rise in

398

temperature (Davidson et al. 2006). Indeed, at ambient temperature, published FTR

399

experiments on Se reduction (Schilling et al. 2018) show that selenate-reducing capacity

400

of the microbial communities are never exceeded. Here, the higher Se reduction rates (Fig.

401

3) for the warm FTRs compared to the cold FTRs are suggestive of microbial enzyme-

402

catalyzed reactions. Microbial control is also explained by our observed variation in the

403

proportion of organic Se species in the outflow solution between the warm and cold FTRs

404

fed with selenate.

405

Söderlund et al. (2016) conducted batch experiments with selenite and selenate under

406

aerobic conditions to assess the impact of temperature on Se removal. They observed low

407

selenate removal, no speciation variation, and no temperature effects from 4 to 38 °C.

408

Under aerobic conditions, selenate reduction is not favorable (Borch et al. 2010;

409

Fernández-Martínez & Charlet 2009). Poor adsorption of selenate on mineral surfaces and

410

low complexation with OM explain the observations reported by Söderlund et al. (2016).

411

However, here the use of FTRs with undisturbed sediment that preserved microbial niches,

412

and the anoxic conditions likely facilitated selenate reduction and removal (Schilling et al.

413

2018).

414

Contrasting Response of Selenite and Selenate to Experimental Conditions

415

All the FTRs fed with selenite had similar normalized rates (NRSe_net; Fig. 3a). The lack of

416

a temperature influence on the FTRs fed with selenite suggest abiotic removal reactions.

417

As shown in the literature, abiotic Se reduction is not dependent on temperature (Söderlund

418

et al. 2016). Bruggeman et al. (2007) observed selenite reduction to organically bound Se

419

species by humic substances in abiotic laboratory batch experiments. Similarly, Dalai et al.

420

(2023) showed selenite removal by abiotic interactions with OM, which were explained by

421

the presence of Fe. In contrast, microbial selenate reduction is known as a primary Se

422

removal pathway (Wells & Stolz 2020), with its reduction by abiotic pathways being slow

17

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1w0d2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4940-3372 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

423

(Dalai et al. 2023) or absent (Bruggeman et al. 2007; VillaRomero et al. 2013) depending

424

on the nature of the sediment.

425

We hypothesise that selenite is removed predominantly via abiotic pathway, while selenate

426

is removed predominantly via biotic pathways. Our hypothesis is based on the observation

427

that OM- and Fe-rich sediments remove selenite (

428

either temperature or OM lability, as shown by the similar NRSe_net_4 values between FTRs.

429

In contrast, selenate seems to be controlled by biotic pathways, consistent with the decrease

430

in NRSe_net_6 alongside a decrease in temperature (Fig. 3a). This could be ascribed to an

431

additional step needed in the reduction of selenate: most pathways for selenate reduction

432

to Se0 involve a two-step process where selenate reduction to selenite is followed by

433

selenite reduction to organo-Se or Se0(s) (Wells & Stolz 2020).

434

Previous studies reported maximal selenate reduction rates based on a regression of

435

potential rate as a function of the selenate input concentrations, following a Michaelis-

436

Menten equation (Schilling et al. 2018; Steinberg & Oremland 1990; VillaRomero et al.

437

2013). Those microcosms were not Se-limited, as the authors insured that selenate was the

438

sole terminal electron acceptor provided to the microbial community (Pallud & Van

439

Cappellen 2006; Steinberg & Oremland 1990; VillaRomero et al. 2013). Here, other

440

electron acceptors remain more abundant, such as the Se is a micronutrient and uptaken for

441

assimilatory purposes. Rates derived are thus representative of in-situ environmental rates

442

pertaining to cold regions, but not of the maximum potential for Se reduction of the

443

sediment. Those reaction rates are lower for selenate (RSe_net_6) than for selenite (RSe_net_4)

444

(Fig. 3b).

445

Net Selenium Reaction Rates Compared to Literature Data

446

Different Se reaction rates associated with sediments, solid phase or incubations are

447

reported in the literature. Some authors refer to Se reduction rates as the rate at which the

448

selenium is reduced to Se0(s) and sequestered in the solid phase by microorganisms (Lenz

449

et al. 2008; Schilling et al. 2018; Steinberg & Oremland 1990). Others refer to removal

450

rates, which are the selenium retention rate on the solid phase (Negi et al. 2020; Thompson

451

et al. 2003). In this paper, we distinguish between these types of reduction rates. The Se

0.1 µM) rapidly and irrespective of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1w0d2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4940-3372 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

452

reaction rates (RSe_net) reported in the literature stem from laboratory experiments

453

conducted at ambient temperatures ranging from 15 to 35°C.

454

We conducted a systematic literature review according to criteria shown on Supplementary

455

Information Figure S18. We found 8 studies reporting Se reduction or removal rates from

456

natural sediments or soils with inflow Se concentrations ranging from nM to mM, and no

457

study reporting results at low temperature. The reported RSe_net values range from 0.0024

458

to 7080 nmol cm-3 d-1, depending on the sediments used, the inflow concentrations, and the

459

microbial communities involved (Table 3).

460

There is thus a paucity of published data on selenite removal, reduction or sequestration

461

rates from laboratory or field experiments involving natural sediments or soils. Most

462

available studies on selenite removal are based on batch experiments which did not

463

reported rates (Table 3) (Darcheville et al. 2008; Li et al. 2015; Paredez et al. 2017;

464

Söderlund et al. 2016; Tolu et al. 2014). Deen et al. (2022) conducted abiotic batch

465

experiments to assess the adsorption capacities of selenite and selenate on various minerals.

466

They reported selenite reaction rates ranging from 0.02 to 0.58 nmol cm-3d-1 at Se

467

concentrations between 8.8 and 12.6 µM, except with pyrite where the selenite reaction

468

rate was markedly higher, reaching 187 nmol cm-3d-1. Our FTRs experiments had selenite

469

reduction rates between 1.8 and 2 nmol cm-3d-1 at an inflow concentration of 2 µM. The

470

higher rates observed in our study may be attributed to the presence of microorganisms and

471

OM in our system.

472

Literature values for RSe_net are related to the inflow concentrations (Steinberg & Oremland

473

1990). Thus, for the sake of comparison, we calculated normalized rates (NRse_net) (Eq. 2)

474

obtain from similar experimental conditions using natural sediments or soils

475

(Supplementary Information Figure S18). The rate obtain from our experiments are in the

476

same order of magnitude as those reported for other lake sediments with low Se, yet lower

477

than those from agricultural soils and pond sediments (Table 3).

The literature review shows that sediment with greater OM and nutrient content (e.g.

479

agricultural sediment) have higher NRSe_net than the hypersaline sediments. Many of the

480

cited paper in the Table 3 evaluated the rate at different depth and concluded that the OM

481

content was the main parameter influencing the selenate reduction rates.

482

Experiment geometry appear to play a role in the reduction rates obtained, batch yielding

483

faster rates than either columns or reactors. VillaRomero et al. (2013) and Schilling et al.

484

(2018) used sediments from the littoral site of the same lake, in similar condition, but obtain

485

different rates (Table 3). Those variation are probably du to the increase in contact area

486

between the sediment and the solution in batch experiments.

487

In the FTR experiment, the NRse_net increase with the content in organic matter, from

488

hypersaline lake sediment to organic rich mollisol (Table 3). Pi et al.(2023) conducted

489

flow-through experiments with undisturbed mollisol, fed with 860 nM of selenate but did

490

not report reaction rates. Using their data, we calculated a RSe_net_6 of 2.18 nmol cm-3 d-1

491

for their 15 cm depth FTR. Mollisols showed higher NRSe_net compared our freshwater lake

492

sediments, probably due to their higher content in fresh and labile OM (Pi et al. 2023).

493

Thus, the warm FTR with fresh labile OM showed the highest Se removal capacity, with a

494

stable Se efflux (0.94 nmol d-1 L-1) regardless of changes in the inflow concentration or Se

495

speciation

496

concentrations more than tripled following the experiment in this FTR, leading to the

497

highest Se concentrations in the sediment (161.8 ± 0.5 µmol kg-1) (Supplementary

498

Information Figure S15). Based on these results, we conclude that Se sequestration is faster

499

in aquatic system rich in labile OM as temperature increases, by about 2-fold. This

500

conclusion supports the field-derived calculation that Se flux from the sediment increase

501

between the winter and the summer time (Laberge-Carignan et al. 2024).

502

Environmental relevance and transferability of the results

503

As many before us, we determined selenate removal rate in sediments. The literature

504

review (Table 3) highlights the lack of experiment on selenite removal in environmentally

505

relevant conditions and the lack experiment at low temperature (e.g. 4 °C). It does show,

506

however, the OM plays a key role on selenate removal.

507

This experiment aimed to assess the impact of temperature and OM content on the mobility

508

of selenite and selenate in sediments using FTRs. Surface sediments with labile, fresh OM

509

removed 50% more Se than sediment with more recalcitrant OM. FTRs with fresh OM

510

produced lower dissolved Se efflux along more reduced electron acceptor, and more

511

degraded DOC in their outflows, suggesting higher microbial metabolism.

512

While temperature had little effect on selenite mobility at low concentrations, it

513

significantly impacted selenate sequestration rates which decreased by more than 50 %

514

under cold temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment to evaluate Se

515

mobility starting with selenate or selenite at temperatures lower than 15°C. We hypothesize

516

that the difference points to two distinct reduction pathways: an abiotic pathway that

517

reduces selenite, which is less affected by temperature, and a microbial pathway that

518

reduces and sequesters selenate which is affected by temperature. Cold region soils are thus

519

likely to increasingly retain Se. Those soils include peatlands in permafrost landscape,

520

organic-rich lake sediments and organic-rich cryosols susceptible to warming under

521

climate change. As a result, Se fluxes to the aquatic environment may decrease, while the

522

risk of Se deficiencies throughout the food web may increase.
