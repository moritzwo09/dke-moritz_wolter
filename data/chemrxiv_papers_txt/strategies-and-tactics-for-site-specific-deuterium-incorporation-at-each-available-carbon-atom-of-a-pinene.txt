ABSTRACT: The development of several unique strategies and tactics for the synthesis of a-pinene
isotopologues that has culminated in access to all eight possible isomers with deuterium incorporated selectively at each available carbon atom is described. Access to this library of isotopologues
provides new tools to more fully investigate the atmospheric autoxidation of a-pinene, a complex
process that plays a major role in the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the Earth’s
atmosphere.

Introduction. a-Pinene (1), a chiral bicyclic monoterpene, is the most abundant terpenoid found
in nature.1 Named for the conifer pine trees whose oils contain it in concentrations as high as 80%,
a-pinene (1) plays important roles in plant and animal biological processes, as well as chemical
synthesis, where it has found widespread use as an inexpensive chiral building block.2-3 Beyond its
terrestrial importance, a-pinene (1) plays a major role in the Earth’s climate system due to its high
volatility and rapid reactivity towards atmospheric oxidants driven by its electron-rich alkene,
abundant C–H bonds and strained cyclobutane ring (Figure 1A).4-7 Emitted from the Earth’s Boreal
forests in quantities of 32 Tg/year (from a total of ~95 Tg/year monoterpene),1 a-pinene (1) undergoes gas-phase oxidation in the troposphere with ozone to generate the unstable Criegee intermediate 2 (Figure 1B), which decomposes rapidly through a series of H-atom abstractions and hydroperoxyl radical intermediates formed by oxygen addition to produce a complex mixture of highly
oxidized molecules (also known as HOMs).8-10 These HOMs are significantly less volatile and more
polar than a-pinene, leading to a condensation from the gas-phase to the aqueous-phase and the
formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) which ultimately influences the global climate system
through the nucleation of clouds.6
Numerous studies have probed the formation of HOMs in ambient conditions or under controlled
conditions within atmospheric chambers, providing initial key insights into the oxidation kinetics
and possible structures of intermediates through the use of mass spectrometric techniques.6-7, 10-16
Remarkably, a-pinene undergoes gas-phase autoxidation to produce highly oxidized monomers incorporating up to 11 oxygen atoms within 300 ms reaction time,9 while longer times lead to formation of dimers possessing upwards of 18 oxygens.7, 10, 17 The structural identity of these species
and mechanisms for their formation have been the subject of speculation on the basis of a combination of mass spectrometric data and computational investigations (Figure 1C). For example,
breakdown of Criegee intermediate 2 followed by 1,4-H atom abstraction, loss of HO• and subsequent reaction with dioxygen leads to detected species with a molecular formula C10H15O4, whose
open-shell structure could be one or all of the possible isomers 3, 4 or 5.14, 18 Similarly, incorporation
of additional oxygen atoms leads to a dominant signal with the molecular formula C10H15O8, whose
structure has been suggested as the ring-opened peroxyl radical 6 and/or intact cyclobutane 8,9, 19
while structures such as peroxides 7 and 9 have been proposed for higher weight dimeric signals
formed from these respective monomer species.19-20 Despite the importance of a-pinene-derived
HOMs there remains limited experimental evidence to validate the positions of C–H abstraction,
hampering definitive structural identification of proposed compounds (i.e., 3–9, for example) and
limiting a comprehensive elucidation of the complex oxidation pathways.

Figure 1. The structure of a-pinene (A), oxidation pathways leading to SOA formation (B) and proposed structures of selected HOMs (C).
Motivated by these and other questions, we have explored the role that synthetic organic chemistry can play in providing new insights into atmospheric chemistry.21 This work targeted stable and
isolatable compounds, such as isoprene-derived epoxides22-24 and organosulfates,25-26 a-pinene-derived ester and aldol dimers,27 and caryophyllene-derived aldehydes.28-29 We considered the synthesis of complex peroxide dimers such as 7 and 9 to be impractical due to their presumed instability and possible hazardous decomposition, yet were drawn to the puzzle of a-pinene autoxidation
pathways and the structure of HOMs. Consequently, we initiated an effort to prepare deuterated
isotopologues of a-pinene for use in studies aimed at providing new insights into HOM formation
mechanisms, structure and properties (Figure 2). The rationale for stable isotope incorporation
was driven by the planned use of HRMS to distinguish between oxidized intermediates, thereby
providing valuable information into the site of C–H abstraction. Some preliminary results from early
efforts have been reported,11, 18, 30-31 in part due to the ease with which a-pinene-10,10,10-d3 (11)

full suite of site-selectively deuterated isotopologues in order to generate a comprehensive data set.

the eight possible isotopologues of a-pinene with deuterium substitution at each possible individual carbon atom (Figure 2).
At the outset it was important for us to clearly define the required parameters for deuterium incorporation within a-pinene such that the products obtained would be useful for future autooxidation investigations,11 namely 100% site selectivity and complete deuterium incorporation as defined by the limits of 1H-NMR spectroscopy signal-to-noise (i.e., ~20:1). Samples existing as mixtures of regioisomeric isotopologues would be problematic in a study focused on determining the
specific site of oxidation. a-Pinene possesses eight hydrogen bearing carbon atoms in distinct environments and it was tempting to conjecture that an approach utilizing direct C–H functionalization
of a-pinene itself might provide access to the eight required targets. Given the inherent challenges
of such an undirected C–H functionalization strategy,33 however, we did not view such an approach
as currently feasible or practical and therefore opted to pursue an approach with its foundations in
synthetic design and functional group manipulation (Figure 2). Broadly speaking, our work employs two distinct approaches; a top-down strategy wherein the bicyclo[3.1.1]heptyl ring system is
already present within the starting material [i.e., nopinone (10) or verbenone (14)] and a bottom4

up strategy that forges the crucial bicyclic framework from monocyclic precursors [i.e., Hagemann’s
ester (18) or carvone (20)]. Incorporation of deuterium atoms was accomplished from suitably disposed precursors either by addition of CD3Li, H–D exchange with D2O or by exhaustive reduction
using LiAlD4. Each of these methods, when conducted on the appropriately designed synthetic intermediate, would fulfil the parameters for deuterium incorporation we had defined at the outset
(see above). While the focus of this report is on the diverse array of synthetic strategies and tactics
employed to access these new compounds, we envision that this access will open exciting avenues
for discovery in the field of atmospheric science in the near future.
Results and Discussion. When we initiated our research project, only limited prior effort had
been directed towards the synthesis of deuterium labeled a-pinene isotopologues. In 1974, Shaffer
and Pesaro had reported a synthesis of a-pinene-9,9,9-d3 (13) as a precursor to verbenone-9,9,9-d3
as part of an effort to investigate the photochemical isomerization of verbenone.34 Borden and
coworkers reported a related route to 13 in 1980 as part of studies investigating the rearrangement
of bicyclooctadienes.35 In 1980, Skattebøl and Stenstrøm reported a synthesis of a-pinene-10,10,10d3 (11) in order to probe the biosynthetic origins of insect pheromones.36 Beyond these two isotopologues, access to the other isotopologues was unknown in the literature thereby providing us with
significant intellectual motivation to devise novel and efficient approaches for site selective deuteration of all possible carbon atoms within a-pinene. Because we desired access to a-pinene10,10,10-d3 (11) for some planned environmental chamber and spectroscopic studies, we first considered Skattebøl and Stenstrøm’s reported route which proceeded by the addition of CD3MgI to
nopinone (10) followed by dehydration of alcohol 22 using “thoroughly purified sulfonyl chloride
in pyridine” to afford 11 in 37% yield from 10 (Scheme 1).36 They reported that 2% of a b-pinene
derivative along with 2% of an unidentified impurity was present within the distilled product, so
while this route may have proven serviceable, we sought an alternative method. To avoid the formation of the unwanted b-pinene isomer, our new route involved initial formation of enol triflate
24 using Comin’s reagent (23),37 which underwent a smooth, regiospecific coupling with the cuprate derived from CD3Li to afford a-pinene-10,10,10-d3 (11) in 57% yield from nopinone (10).32
This strategy was then adapted to access a-pinene-3-d (12) by first carrying out an exhaustive hydrogen–deuterium exchange at C3 of nopinone (10) under basic conditions, followed by formation
of 3-d-enol triflate 25. Subsequent methyl cuprate coupling delivered the desired isotopologue 12
in 27% over the three steps from nopinone (10).
Nopinone (10) also served as the starting material for our previously reported synthesis of apinene-9,9,9-d3 (13),32 which was inspired by the earlier work of Shaffer and Pesaro,34 as well as

Borden and coworkers.35 Briefly, caged ether 26 could be generated in reasonable yields by the stereoselective addition of methyl lithium to 10 followed by a Suá rez-type oxidative etherification.38
Fragmentation of the cyclic ether within 26 using acetic anhydride reinstalled the trisubstituted
alkene, leading to an intermediate primary acetate that was converted to alcohol 27 upon exposure
to LiAlH4. Oxidation with wet pyridinium dichromate proceeded with low conversions, giving a 1:1
ratio of the corresponding aldehyde and carboxylic acid. However, a cycle of two consecutive purifications and resubmissions to the oxidation conditions allowed the desired acid 28 to be obtained

yield of 65%. Lastly, the desired a-pinene-9,9,9-d3 (13) isotopologue could be produced in three
steps by a sequence of iterative reductions with LiAlD4.
Verbenone (14) served as a suitable starting material for three additional isotopotogues: a-pinene4,4-d2 (15), a-pinene-7,7-d2 (16) and a-pinene-1-d (17). Reduction of verbenone (14) with lithium

diasteromeric allyl chlorides (major isomer 32 shown) with a crude yield of approximately 80%
(Scheme 2). The allylic chlorides proved highly unstable and the mixture was treated directly with
LiAlD4 without purification to afford two reduced products in a ratio 3:1 favoring the desired SN2
product (15) over the undesired minor product, 33 (stereochemistry not determined), derived
from a competing SN2’ pathway. Separation of these two hydrocarbons could be accomplished by
careful chromatography using AgNO3-impregnated silica gel40 to ultimately allow isolation of pure
a-pinene-4,4-d2 (15) in 13% yield. It is also worth highlighting at this point that the isolation of apinene derivatives using chromatographic methods can be particularly challenging due to their relative volatility (the very property that makes a-pinene atmospherically relevant!); care must be
taken to use low boiling eluents, such as pentane and ether, and to remove these solvents with care
under moderate levels of reduced pressure so as to not also vaporize the precious a-pinene species.

Scheme 2. Synthesis of the a-pinene isotopologue with site specific deuterium incorporation at C4.
The photochemical isomerization of verbenone (14) to chrysanthenone (34) has been studied extensively,41-42 and we hoped to exploit this rearrangement to access a-pinene-7,7-d2 (16) and apinene-1-d (17). Using an improved protocol for the isomerization that uses narrow spectrum 350
nm UV bulbs rather than the traditional Hg-lamp (Scheme 3), we were able to access chrysanthenone (34) in 67% yield in order to explore the exhaustive reductive deuteration of the C7 carbonyl group.43 We initially explored formation of tosylate 36 via alcohol 35, but (unsurprisingly)
this species proved recalcitrant to reduction with LiAlD4 due to a combination of steric and strain
effects that preclude SN2 displacement. We turned next to carbonyl deletion methods utilizing hydrazones, but initially had no success, which at the juncture led us to devise a completely different
approach involving total synthesis (see later in Scheme 4). However, returning to this problem
sometime later led to the successful implementation of a modified version of the Cram conditions
for the Wolff–Kishner reduction44 whereby treatment of the corresponding preformed hydrazone

derived from ketone 34 with potassium tert-butoxide in DMSO-d6 generated the desired product,
a-pinene-7,7-d2 (16), in 13% isolated yield. While the yield of this process was not high, the route
is short and deuterium incorporation was complete within the limits of 1H-NMR spectroscopic detection.
Photochemical isomerization of the verbenone scaffold also proved useful to access the C1 bridgehead isotopologue a-pinene-1-d (17, Scheme 4). Hydrogenation of verbenone (14)45 followed by
treatment with NaOD in D2O provided ketone 37 in 64% yield, which was converted to verbenone1-d (38) through a Saegusa–Ito oxidation.46 Exposure of 38 to 350 nm UV light then provided ketone
39 in 49% yield with the deuterium atom now situated at the required bridgehead location. The
modified Cram conditions for the Wollf–Kishner reduction we had devised earlier then allowed direct access to a-pinene-1-d (17) in 21% yield.

Scheme 4. Synthesis of the a-pinene isotopologue with site specific deuterium incorporation at C7.
As alluded to earlier, frustrations that grew from a strategy whereby the a-pinene skeleton was manipulated to allow for deuterium atom incorporation led us to investigate an alternative total synthesis strategy. We reasoned that such a de novo approach would allow more flexibility in the tactics
used to install the required deuterium atoms. We first targeted a-pinene-7,7-d2 (16) since this was
the compound that had initially stymied our a-pinene skeleton-based efforts (Scheme 4). This
strategy, which we initially reported in 2019,47 was based upon the pioneering total synthesis of apinene by Fallis and Thomas reported in 1973.48-49 Thus, reduction of Hagemann’s ester (18) using
LiAlD4 afforded diol 40, which was converted to enone 41 by treatment with DDQ. Protection and
conjugate methylation generated ketone 42 which set the stage for the key cyclobutene ring-forming step that served as a lynch-pin in the Fallis and Thomas synthesis. An initial aldol condensation
with benzaldehyde was carried out to yield enone 43; a process that ensures regioselective formation of the desired cyclobutane (i.e., 44) upon exposure to NaH. Removal of the benzylidene
blocking group through a retro-aldol process gave rise to nopinone isotopologue 45. Completion of
the synthesis of a-pinene-7,7-d2 (16) then proceeded via triflate 46 in a method akin to the synthesis of a-pinene-10,10,10-d3 (11, see Scheme 1).
This earlier route established the viability of the total synthesis approach to deuterium labeled apinene isotopologues and was used to prepare deuterium labeled secondary organic material
(SOM) for a series of surface specific spectroscopic investigations.47 However, in comparison to the
route that delivers 16 from verbenone (14, see Scheme 3) it is less efficient and also provides the

platform for the preparation of the remaining bridgehead isomer, namely a-pinene-5-d (16,

Scheme 5. Synthesis of the a-pinene isotopologue with site specific deuterium incorporation at C5.
Treatment of Hagemann’s ester (18) with NaH followed by an acidic quench with deuterated sulfuric acid in D2O led to formation of doubly deuterated Hagemann’s ester analog 47. A reduction, oxidation and protection sequence then provided enone 48 which underwent smooth conjugate methylation to yield ketone 49 in 83% yield. Aldol condensation with benzaldehyde using sodium hydroxide also effected cleavage of the acetate group and removal of the unwanted C1 deuterium
atom; tosylation of the liberated hydroxy group afforded enone 50. As before, formation of the cyclobutane ring proceeded effectively and in good yield to deliver enone 51. Unfortunately, however,
the strongly basic conditions required to remove the benzylidene group led to significant (40–50%)
loss of deuterium at C1 during formation of ketone 52. Suppression of this loss could be accomplished by using DMSO-d6 as the solvent, but this also led to additional unselective deuteration at
C3 and C4.47 Hence, this approach would not be viable to access the desired compound with only C5
deuterated, and as such we needed to devise an alternative end-game for converting enone 51 into

a-pinene-5-d (16). Ultimately, this goal was accomplished by an initial cerium chloride-promoted
1,2-addition of MeLi to the ketone of 51 to form tertiary alcohol 53,50 which underwent subsequent
ozonolysis to generate a-ketol 54. Ketone reduction with sodium borohydride was unselective,
whereas diastereoselective reduction could be accomplished effectively using DIBAL, producing
diol 55 as a single stereoisomer in 76% yield. Selective formation of the syn-diol was critical and
allowed final installation of the requisite alkene by means of a Corey–Winter olefination via thiocarbonate 56,51 ultimately allowing isolation of a-pinene-5-d (16) in 24% yield from diol 55.
The final analog required to complete our goal of providing access to all possible a-pinenes with
site specific deuterium incorporation at each available carbon atom was a-pinene-8,8,8-d3 (11),
which has the exo-methyl group substituted. While the diastereomeric endo-methyl group (i.e., C9)
could be deuterated by taking advantage of an intramolecular oxidation (see Scheme 1), it was not
obvious that functionalization of C8 could be accomplished in a related manner. We were drawn,
however, to the known hydroxy pinene derivatives, 57 and 58, produced by the reductive cyclization of epoxycarvone (Scheme 6).52-54 Epoxidation of carvone (20) followed by treatment with
Cp2TiCl2 produces a 2:3 mixture of the diastereomeric diols 57 and 58. In this case, diol 58, which
could be isolated in 38% yield, possesses hydroxylation at the desired C8 carbon, but would require
removal of the unwanted bridgehead hydroxy group. Protection of the less hindered C8 hydroxy
group as its TBDPS ether afforded tertiary alcohol 59, which served as a suitable substrate to explore deoxygenation conditions to form ether 60. Ultimately, after extensive exploration and optimization,55 it was found that initial quantitative formation of the N-phthalomidoyl oxalate allowed
for a Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 photocatalyzed-reduction to deliver the requisite hydrocarbon (i.e., 60) in 15%
isolated yield.56-57 While low yielding, this protocol provided sufficient material throughput to allow
synthesis of the desired deuterium labeled a-pinene to proceed. Consequently, carboxylic acid 61
was produced in 40% yield following TBDPS removal and oxidation of the free alcohol using wet
PDC.

Scheme 6. Synthesis of the a-pinene isotopologue with site specific deuterium incorporation at C8.
Reduction with LiAlD4 generated alcohol 62, which was converted to a-pinene-8,8,8-d3 (11) by an
additional LiAlD4 reductive displacement of the corresponding tosylate.
Conclusion. Synthetic approaches providing access to the eight possible isotopolgues of a-pinene
possessing site specific deuterium substitution at each of the available carbon atoms have been developed. Two distinct strategies were realized; one that used starting materials already possessing
the bicyclo[3.1.1]heptyl ring system present within a-pinene (i.e., nopinone and verbenone), and
the other requiring formation of the cyclobutane ring from cyclohexyl precursors (i.e., Hagemann’s
ester and carvone). The completion of each individual a-pinene target relied upon effective means
for quantitative deuterium incorporation and utilized a careful combination of classic and contemporary chemical transformations. For example, synthesis of the C5 bridgehead isotopologue 19
used the venerable Corey–Winter olefination to avoid deuterium loss, while access to the C8 endomethyl species 21 deployed a modern photocatalytic deoxygenation to remove an unwanted tertiary hydroxy group. A novel modification of the Cram conditions for the Wolff–Kishner reduction
of ketones was also developed to allow carbonyl deletion with concomitant incorporation of deuterium atoms. While the focus of our efforts was on analogues with single carbon atoms deuterated,
it is conceivable that a combination of the various protocols developed would allow preparation of
additional a-pinene isotopologues with two or more carbon atoms selectively labeled should such
species be desired. Current attention is now focused on using the eight isotopologues reported here
in atmospheric studies to probe the intricate details of a-pinene autoxidation, the results of which
will be reported in due course.

Experimental Procedures
General Experimental. All experiments were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere in flamedried glassware. All reagents were used as purchased. Reaction solvents were purchased as anhydrous or purified by either a solvent purification column or dilstillation. Starting materials and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Thermo Fisher Scientific, or TCI and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Diisopropylamine and pyridine were distilled over CaH2
prior to use. Purifications of products were performed by flash column chromatography using silica
gel (230 – 400 mesh) as a stationary phase. Silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (10 wt% loading, 230 mesh) and used directly from the bottle. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography technique was performed on silica gel pre-coated glass-backed plates, and the reactions were examined by UV-light (254 nm) irradiation or staining with potassium permanganate
stain or p-anisaldehyde stain. A Bruker Avance III 400 MHz, 500 MHz, or 600 MHz instrument was
used to record 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all compounds. NMR data are reported as brs = broad
singlet, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. Signals are detailed in ppm
and coupling constants in Hz. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded with a time of flight
(TOF) mass analyzer Bruker Impact-II Mass Spectrometer. A Bruker Tensor 37 FTIR spectrometer
was used to obtain infrared spectra of compounds and data were reported in cm-1. All melting points
are uncorrected. The syntheses of α-pinene-9,9,9-d3 (11), α-pinene-10,10,10-d3 (13) and α-pinene6,6-d2 (16) were carried out according to our previously published procedures.32, 47
