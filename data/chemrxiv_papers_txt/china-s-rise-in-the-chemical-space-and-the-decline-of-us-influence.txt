Abstract
At the turn of the 21st century, China has achieved a spectacular surge in the scientific
arena. However, little is known about its role in the material core of chemistry, encoded in
the chemical space, which spans the discovery of chemicals. Here we show, by analysing
the chemical space between 1996 and 2022, that its expansion has been dominated by
China ever since 2013. Chinese dominance occurs at different levels, from organic to
rare-earth chemistry, but is less dramatic in organometallic chemistry. We also found that
Chinese dominance is mainly the product of the country’s own efforts, rather than the result
of international collaboration. China’s surge mainly comes at the expense of the contribution
of the US. Interestingly, the US share of the chemical space is more dependent on
international collaboration, which mainly occurs with China. We also observe the emergent
role of India. We believe these results provide a contemporary account of the geopolitics of
the chemical space, which may constitute the basis for future national and international
science policies, as well as research and development agendas.

Main
China's remarkable rise in the scientific and technological arena of the 21st century is
well-documented, along with the factors contributing to this growth.1,2 However, limited
attention has been given to China's influence on the recent development of chemistry—the
most prolific natural science in terms of publications and arguably the most significant in its
economic and societal impact.3 In particular, little is known about China’s role in the
expansion of the chemical space (CS), which spans all chemicals and reactions reported in
the literature.3 Here we quantify China’s contribution to the CS and contrast it with
contributions of other leading countries, especially the US. Likewise, we quantify the role of
international collaboration upon the expansion of the CS, which has grown at a rate of a bit

more than 4% for more than two centuries—a pace maintained in spite of varying economic
or social conditions,4 which include dramatic shifts of the centres of research among
countries. After being led by France, Germany and the US,5 with no effect on its stable
growth rate, CS is currently undergoing another shift, from the US to China, while keeping its
growth rate.4 Consequently, the increasing contributions of China to the CS come at the
expense of other countries, as we report in this contribution. In particular, it is the US whose
share is dramatically decreasing. Meanwhile, the relative contributions of other countries
remain relatively steady, although India's share is gradually rising, and Japan's share is
decreasing, albeit less dramatically than the shifts observed for China and the US.
Interestingly, US contributions to the CS increasingly rely on international collaboration,
especially with China, while the Asian country's contributions are mainly the result of its own
national efforts. We also found that China is today the leading contributor to the organic
chemistry and rare-earth regions of the CS. The former spans the vast majority of the CS
and the rare-earth region is a key driver of modern technologies.
The study is based on information retrieved from Reaxys®,1 Dimensions and OpenAlex
databases for the time period 1996-2022 (Methods, Figure S1), which shows China's
predominant role in the CS as it covers 41% of the current CS, dwarfing the 11% of the US
(Figure 1a). While China grew exponentially during this period, US participation modestly
grew until 2007 and afterwards rapidly dropped (Figure 1a). In 2013, China became the
overall leading contributor. The only other country whose share was systematically
increasing is India, but its growth is modest compared with that of China (Figure 1a).

National and collaborative efforts to expand the chemical space
The role of international collaboration in the 21st-century scientific and technological
Chinese emergence has been documented, especially with the US.7–9 We found that this
collaboration dominates the CS. Nonetheless, its overall contribution is modest,
representing less than 2% of all discoveries of chemicals (Figure 1b). China-US

collaboration grew over time, peaked in 2017 and ever since has been volatile (Figure 1b).
This partnership increased hand in hand with the increment of bilateral agreements enacted
during the Obama administration (2009-2017).10 Likewise, the post-2017 perturbation is
presumably related to the 2018 China initiative, championed by the US government.9
Notwithstanding the China-US collaboration, over 90% of China's contribution to the CS was
achieved by domestic teams operating independently. In contrast, the US has seen a decline
in solo contributions, which exceeded 95% between 1996 and 2006 but sharply decreased
to less than 80% of its participation in the CS expansion (Figure 1c). The drop of US solo
contributions has been counterbalanced by an increase in international collaboration (Figure
1b), in particular with China.
Although the US invests more of its GDP on research and development than China (Figure
S2), the big gap on the expansion of the CS between the two countries is expected to widen.
China's economy continues to thrive (Figure 1d), since 2005 the Asian country boasts a
considerably larger number of researchers than the US (Figure 1e) and the debt is much
larger for the US than for China (Figure S3).

2008 and 2020 local and global drops on the expanding
chemical space
We observe effects, with certain delay, of the 2007/2008 Global Financial Crisis for the US
contribution to the CS and of the COVID-19 pandemic for China (Figure 1a). In the long run,
the 2007/2008 crisis did not reduce the expansion of the space, whereas the pandemic did
(Figures 2a, S4). Although China experienced a drop of researchers by 2007/2008 (Figure
1e), this did not affect its increasing contributions to the CS, which counterbalanced the
declining US contributions (Figure 1a). The pandemic and the rapid lockdowns in China11
reduced the contributions of the Asian country and, therefore, of the whole CS (Figure 2a).
In contrast, the more relaxed US lockdowns12 did not largely affect the US contributions to
the space (Figure 1a).

Chemical space, its subspaces and national contributions to
their expansions
We divided the space into its organic, organometallic and rare-earth (REE) subspaces
(Figure 2a, Methods). We found that the exponential expansion of the space, as observed
since 1800,4 is largely dominated by the discovery of organic chemicals (Figure 2a). In
contrast to the swift growth of the organic subspace, the organometallic and REE subspaces
exhibit a distinct trend (Figure 2a). The former slightly increased its expansion until 2013
and ever since has slowed down its unfolding. REE chemical space, in turn, grows slowly.
Organic space: since organic chemistry encompasses the majority of the CS, the overall
growth of CS mirrors the expansion of organic chemistry, with China currently contributing
about 40% of the organic CS (Figure S5) and China-US collaboration accounting for about
2% of this subspace (Figure S6). Likewise, the 2007/2008 crisis did not affect the organic
CS, while the 2020 crisis did (Figures 2a, S5).

Organometallic space: unlike the organic CS, the Chinese leading role in the
organometallic CS is very recent and much less pronounced (Figure 2b). While the
contributions of the US and Japan decreased rapidly, not only China, but also India and
Germany increased their share (Figure 2b). At the collaborative level, China-US partnership
remarkably increased in 2008 and kept growing until 2010, when it began to oscillate (Figure
2c). The pandemic marked the change of dominant country on the expansion of the
organometallic space, with the US stepping aside and giving place to China as the leading
discoverer of organometallics. In fact, it was a dramatic change, as right after 2020 US
contributions plummeted and Chinese ones drastically surged (Figure 2b). The pandemic
also brought a drop in the China-US collaboration (Figure 2c), which suggests that China’s
post-pandemic rise was driven by its own national efforts.
REE space: as REEs become technologically and hence economically ever more
relevant,15 its extraction and commercialisation is dominated by only a few countries, with
the leading role of China.16 This has led to international tensions17 and to set up research
programmes motivating innovation in REE chemistry (SI).18 Our results show that China not
only controls the extraction and trade of REEs but also leads the exploration of their
chemical space (Figure 2d). Nonetheless, REE space grows slowly (Figure 2a). While
earlier the shares were distributed among several countries, China became dominant
already by 2004, with a current share of the REE space of about 40%, while most of the top
contributors slowed down their discoveries (Figure 2d). The drop is particularly dramatic for
Japan. India, in contrast, grew from 5% in 1996 to 10% today. Russia also grew, but less
steadily. Currently, however, China's contribution is four times that of the second largest
producers of REE compounds: India and Russia (Figure 2d).
China-US collaboration has grown from less than 1% of the share of the REE space before
2008 to 2% in 2020. However, over the following two years, presumably as the result of a
blend of pandemic and political factors that include, for instance the American China
initiative,19 the collaboration declined, and it currently represents 0.86% of the REE CS.

Despite the geopolitic dynamics of the CS, the chemical nature of the CS has remained
untouched, as the chemical composition of substances of each one of the three analysed
chemical subspaces has not been affected (Figure S7).

Methods
Data
As chemical space (CS) entered into a new regime of its expansion by 1980,4 we retrieved
information from Reaxy on substances having molecular formula and publication year

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-d2zc8 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0604-2207 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

between 1980 and 2022 (data dump on 27th July 2023), which led to 17,621,956
substances. To complete the bibliographic information associated with the publications
reporting these substances, we retrieved information from Dimensions and OpenAlex
(bibliographic databases). By using the DOI of each publication, when available from
Reaxys®, we pulled the available bibliographic data from the bibliographic databases. When
DOIs were not available in Reaxys®, a combination of the bibliographic information on
Reaxys® about authors, publication titles, years, pages and ISSNs, was used as the key to
pull data from the bibliographic databases. As Reaxys® data match with bibliographic
information was over 80% for the period 1996-2022 (Figure S1), this was the selected period
for the current study, which involves 15,725,488 chemicals with author’s affiliation countries.
In case of an author having multiple affiliations, for the sake of simplicity only the first
affiliation was selected. Reaxys® data used in this work is property of RELX Intellectual
Properties SA. The code supporting all calculations is available at GitHub and the processed
data with the participation of each country in the CS is provided in the SI.
Country assignment to substances
Based on bibliographic information, the annual contribution of each country to the expansion
of CS was calculated by considering the share of the number of substances reported by
each country in the respective year. For example, if a paper authored by three scientists
reports one new substance and two of the authors have affiliation to a Chinese institution
and the third one to an American institution, we assign 2/3 of substances to China and 1/3
substances to the US. Thus, if for a given year , there are
new reported chemicals,
country contribution to the CS of year is given by

the first time in year and

Top countries in the expansion of the chemical space
For every year , countries were ranked based on their
and an average rank was
calculated for each country. Top-10 countries contributing more to the expansion of the CS
were selected and plotted in Figure 1a.
Regions of the chemical space
Classification of substances in different regions of the CS was based on the presence of
particular elements in the formulas of the studied compounds.
Organic: We say that a chemical is an organic substance if carbon is part of its composition.
Organometallic: All chemicals containing carbon and metals. If a compound is a salt, at
least one of the ions must contain C and a metal. As metals, we considered the following
elements:
Li,Be,Na,Mg,Al,K,Ca,Sc,Ti,V,Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn,Ga,Rb,Sr,Y,Zr,Nb,Mo,Tc,Ru,Rh,Pd,Ag,C
d,In,Sn,Cs,Ba,La,Ce,Pr,Nd,Pm,Sm,Eu,Gd,Tb,Dy,Ho,Er,Tm,Yb,Lu,Hf,Ta,W,Re,Os,Ir,Pt,Au,Hg
,Tl,Pb,Bi,Po,Ra,Ac,Th,Pa,U,Np,Pu,Am,Cm,Bk,Cf,Es,At,Fr,Fm,Md,No,Lr.
REE: all chemicals containing at least one of the following elements Y, Sc, La, Ce, Pr, Nd,
Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu.

To determine the span of the regions of the CS by different chemical elements and
compositions in any particular year t, for every new compound published in we extracted
its formula. Each formula led to a composition, that is the set of chemical elements arranged
in lexicographic order that belong into the formula. Thus, for instance, for compound H2SO4,
its composition is HOS. The percentage of CS of region spanned by composition in
year

was determined by
