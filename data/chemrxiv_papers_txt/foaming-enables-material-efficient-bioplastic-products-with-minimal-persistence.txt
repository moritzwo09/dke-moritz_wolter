Abstract
Mismanaged plastic products should be designed to inherently reduce their environmental
impacts by optimizing material efficiency and minimizing environmental persistence. Foaming
biodegradable bioplastics (i.e., introducing microstructural pores into the material) was
hypothesized to achieve this objective. To test this hypothesis, the marine biodegradation of novel
𝜌
cellulose diacetate (CDA) foams of varying relative density ( 𝜌𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚=0.09-1.00) was evaluated in a
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑

𝜌

flow-through seawater mesocosm. After 36 weeks, the CDA foams ( 𝜌𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚=0.09) lost 65-70% of
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑

their mass, while equivalent polystyrene foams persisted with no change in mass. The
degradation rates of the CDA foams were ~15 times that of solid CDA and the fastest of any
plastic reported in the ocean. Material indices, value functions, and qualitative descriptors for
circularity indicated that CDA foams could be the favorable choice of material for food-packaging
applications with potential benefits to society worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
Foaming of biodegradable bioplastics thus represents a promising strategy toward minimizing the
environmental impacts of frequently mismanaged consumer plastics.

Global plastic production and usage is estimated to rise in the coming decades 1. Without
significant interventions across multiple stages of the plastic life cycle, an increase in plastic
pollution will likely coincide with this trend1. In its 2021 report2, one of six key interventions
identified by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for mitigating
the potential impacts of plastic-associated pollution was redesigning plastic products by
embracing the principles of green chemistry and engineering 3,4. Following these principles, new
designs should inherently have reduced environmental impacts rather than rely on external
systems to manage potential harm. These principles can be achieved by minimizing the amount
of material used to make the product and ensuring its degradability in all environments (e.g.,
wastewater, freshwater, seawater, soil, compost, and landfill)4,5.
Material efficiency quantifies the amount of material used to make a functional product 6.
Optimizing the material efficiency of a plastic product has the added benefit of reducing many of
its embodied environmental impacts (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater usage)
because these impacts are largely proportional to the amount of material used7–9. Foams can be
the most material-efficient form of a material10. As a result, along with their other properties (e.g.,
low thermal conductivity, vibration and impact absorption), plastic foams have found many
applications, particularly in food packaging11.
Despite these favorable properties for packaging and insulation, the end-of-life management of
plastic foams poses challenges. Mechanical recycling facilities do not accept plastic foams
because they lack the capability to sort these items, their material efficiency makes them less
valuable items, and items used for food applications are often contaminated12,13. As a result, most
plastic foams follow a linear life cycle that ends with landfilling or incineration12. Moreover,
mismanaged foamed items routinely leak into the environment, greatly contributing to plastic
pollution. In 2022, plastic foam takeaway containers were the seventh most collected item in
beach surveys globally13. For these reasons and others, legislation has been enacted in states
and municipalities13 and proposed in the U.S. Congress to ban plastic foams, namely polystyrene
(PS) foams14. Yet, this legislation appears to overlook the many benefits that plastic foams provide
because of their material efficiency15. In numerous life-cycle assessments (LCA), PS foam was
the best choice because of this property16,17. Thus, there is a need to understand and quantify the
tradeoffs underlying design decisions and environmental impacts and investigate alternative
foamed materials with improved end-of-life scenarios.
Foaming biodegradable bioplastics may solve these conflicting outcomes of widely used plastic
foams. Several biodegradable bioplastics, such as cellulose diacetate (CDA)18–21, have been
shown to biodegrade in natural environments (soil, freshwater, and seawater) on timescales of
months to years22. The degradation of plastics in the environment is a surface-driven process that
depends on the surface area-to-volume ratio (SA/V) of the item and the specific surface
degradation rate of the material (𝑘𝑑 )23. The latter is a material property that quantifies the rate of
surface erosion of a material in a given environment. The dependence on geometry suggests
foams may degrade appreciably faster than their solid counterpart because of increased surface
area22,24.
Herein, we evaluated several prototyped CDA and conventional PS foams for their marine
degradation, determined relationships between degradation rate and foam properties, and
demonstrated the value of CDA foams as next-generation materials that are material efficient,
non-persistent, and enable circularity.

RESULTS
We first validated that SA/V is a key control of the lifetime of CDA in the coastal environment,
using solid CDA films (𝜌𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑 = 1.35 g/cm3) of different thickness (1, 5, and 10 mil), (Figures 1AB, Supplementary Discussion 1). The relative mass loss rates of the films trended linearly with
SA/V (R2 = 0.996), being fastest for the 1 mil (SA/V = ~80) and slowest for the 10 mil (SA/V = ~8)
(Figure 1A). Consequently, environmental lifetime depended on film thickness, scaling linearly
with increasing thickness from ~12 to ~91 weeks for the 1 to 10 mil films, respectively
(Supplementary Table 1).
The dependence of CDA lifetime on SA/V motivated the development of foamed CDA articles with
increased SA/V and presumably shortened lifetime in the coastal ocean. We incubated a
collection of CDA foams of varying densities in a flow-through seawater mesocosm and monitored
their degradation over 36 weeks. Comparable PS foams were used as negative controls. These
foams varied in thickness from 30 to 150 mil, in pore structure being either isolated or closed-cell,
𝜌𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚
and in relative density ( 𝜌
) from low density (<0.10) to medium density (0.60-0.70)
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑

(Supplementary Tables 2-S5).

Foaming drastically accelerates the biodegradation of CDA in the coastal ocean.
The CDA foams degraded rapidly under coastal seawater conditions (Figure 1C). During the 36week incubation, the extent of degradation for a 98-mil thick, low-density CDA foam was visually
discernable as a progressive increase in the foam’s transparency (Figure 1C). The medium and
low-density foams lost more than 35 and 65% of their mass by 36 weeks, respectively (Figure
1D). At the microstructural level, the opening of the pores within the medium-density CDA foam
was visible (Figure 2A-B). Similarly, the cell walls and edges of the low-density CDA foams
showed evidence of their degradation after 36 weeks (Figure 2C-F). Comparatively, the PS foams
had no measurable mass loss (Figure 1E) and no microstructural changes (Supplementary
Figure 2). Values of 𝑘𝑑 for the PS foams were constrained to less than 5 µm/yr based on
calculated mass loss trajectories for different values of 𝑘𝑑 and the foam’s geometric dimensions
(i.e., length, width, and thickness).

The values of 𝑘𝑑 for the thick CDA foams (30-115 mil) were substantially greater than those of the
thin, solid CDA films (1-10 mil). The low-density CDA foams had values of 𝑘𝑑 that were ~15-fold
greater than that of solid CDA (Supplementary Table 1). Accordingly, while a 1-mm thick solid
CDA film would take an estimated 15-20 years to fully degrade in the coastal ocean, a low-density
foam of the same dimensions would take less than a year. The value of 𝑘𝑑 for the medium-density
foam was double that of solid CDA (156  7 µm/yr; Supplementary Table 1). Comparatively, a
prototype foam of a similar formulation and density investigated in Mazzotta et al.19 had a value
of 𝑘𝑑 about seven times that of solid CDA (445  26 µm/yr; Supplementary Table 1). The
difference in the value of 𝑘𝑑 for these two medium-density foams likely stemmed from differences
in their pore size, shape, and distribution (Supplementary Figure 3). The medium-density foam
evaluated in Mazzotta et al.19 had smaller pores (average diameters of 46 v.s. 68 µm) and more
of them (cross-sectional areal densities of 177000 v.s. 99000 pores/cm2) than the medium-density
foam used in this study (Supplementary Figure 3). Compared to foaming, plastic formulation
(the use of filler and plasticizer) had a minor effect (<25% change) on the value of 𝑘𝑑
(Supplementary Discussion 2, Supplementary Figure 4).
The values of 𝑘𝑑 for the low-density CDA foams were the greatest reported for any plastic
evaluated under environmentally relevant marine conditions (Figure 3A). Moreover, the values of
𝑘𝑑 for the low-density CDA foams were more than quadruple that of paper and 100 to 1000 times
greater than those of solid PP, PS, and PLA. As evidenced for PS, it is expected that foaming will
not increase the value of 𝑘𝑑 for solid plastics with 𝑘𝑑 less than ~10 µm/yr (i.e., PP and PLA in the
marine environment).
The increase in 𝒌𝒅 from foaming is predictable.
The microstructural organization of foams is engineered to yield desired material properties (e.g.,
strength), thus understanding the relationship between foam microstructure and 𝑘𝑑 affords
predictive design and weighing tradeoffs between material properties. The reported value of 𝑘𝑑
for the foams was an apparent 𝑘𝑑 because these values were calculated using the macroscopic
dimensions of the foams, not their microscopic dimensions. This treatment is consistent with that
of other material properties for foams11. As with other material properties determined in this way
(e.g., moduli, strengths, and conductivities), relative material properties of foams can be
𝜌
connected to the 𝜌𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚 of the foam. The microstructural organization of the foam is directly related
𝜌𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚11

to its 𝜌

𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑

. Accordingly, an empirical relationship was determined between the relative 𝑘𝑑 for
𝑘

𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚

the CDA foams ( 𝑑𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑 ) with that of their 𝜌𝑓𝑜𝑎𝑚 (Figure 3B).

A quadratic relationship fit the best compared to other possible relationships (e.g., linear or power
law). Though preliminary, this relationship is instructive as it makes a first attempt at predicting 𝑘𝑑
for foamed materials. The generalizability of this relationship to foams of other biodegradable
polymers and environments remains to be determined. Future research should investigate the
relationships between cellular architecture and 𝑘𝑑 in more detail to rationally design foams for
minimal persistence and optimal functionality.

Foaming of biodegradable bioplastics achieves material-efficient designs with minimal
environmental lifetimes.
In addition to achieving material-efficient designs, foaming with biodegradable bioplastics
achieves designs with minimal environmental lifetimes. Ashby25 showed that the most materialefficient design for stiffness and strength optimizes a material index (MI) that relates density (𝜌)
to Young’s modulus (𝐸) and yield strength (𝜎𝑦 ), respectively. Material indices are material
properties or groups of them that optimize performance for a given objective (e.g., minimizing
mass, cost, or environmental impact). The solid films and foam sheets investigated in our studies
were evaluated using MIs for those geometries (Supplementary Table 6). By this measure, and
as expected, the foams optimized these MIs compared to the solid material, and overall, the PS
foams optimized these MIs (Figure 4A).
Recently, we applied Ashby’s method of material selection to derive MIs for minimal environmental
lifetime22. With respect to mechanical performance, such MIs relate 𝑘𝑑 to 𝐸 and 𝜎𝑦
(Supplementary Table 6). Low-density CDA foams optimized these MIs (Figure 4B). As for PS,
foaming provided no benefit to reducing the environmental lifetime of items made of this material
because the material was persistent.
Minimizing the environmental impact of a leaked item requires minimizing both mass and
environmental lifetime22. The MIs for each objective were combined into a compound MI of
material efficiency and minimal environmental lifetime as the product of the two individual MIs.
𝜌
For stiffness-limited design, the compound MI was 𝑘 𝐸2/3 and for strength-limited design, the
𝑑

𝜌

compound MI was 𝑘 𝜎 .
𝑑 𝑦

Optimizing these MIs results in selecting the material that best reduces the social cost of plastic
pollution22, which depends on the initial mass and the environmental lifetime of the item. Social
costs reflect the external costs (e.g., air pollution on human health) to society associated with a
good, service, or outcome (e.g., combustion engines). Whereas foaming proved no benefit in
optimizing these MIs for PS, it yielded increased material performance (lowering the social cost
of plastic pollution) by 10-20 times for CDA (Figure 4C). At equivalent densities, CDA optimized
these MIs compared to PS.

DISCUSSION
Holistic, system-level assessments of products and processes are necessary when designing for
circularity and environmental impact. This analysis requires foresight of life cycle outcomes and
recognition of tradeoffs between impacts. Historically, missing from formal methods (e.g., LCA)
has been an accounting of a plastic’s persistence in the environment27,28; despite its recognized
contribution to the adverse impacts of plastic pollution29. Previously, there was limited data on
degradation rates and undefined frameworks for evaluating persistence and tradeoffs with other
environmental impacts and metrics of circularity 22. Now, with data from this study and newly
developed frameworks22, evaluating plastics based on material efficiency and persistence is
achievable. In this section, we provide a system-level assessment for redesigning plastic articles
for food storage applications, considering material selection metrics, economic and societal costs,
and aspects of renewability and circularity.
Redesigning single-use food trays and takeaway containers for circularity and minimizing
environmental impacts.
Food containers and packaging rely on plastic materials because of their low cost, durability,
material efficiency, and food preservation qualities. Packaging raw meat on food trays and storing
food in takeaway containers are two applications in which plastic materials have excelled. Both
items are predominantly made of PS foam and, to a lesser extent, polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), PP, PLA, and paper16,17. Historically, an estimated 10-20 billion PS foam food trays and 67 billion PS foam takeaway containers (e.g., clamshells) have been used annually in the United
States30. According to meta-analyses of LCAs of food trays and takeaway containers, among
these materials, PS foam is one of the best choices for the environment16,17. However, these LCAs
do not account for the environmental impact of mismanaged plastic. Foamed articles, including
food trays and takeaway containers, routinely leak into the environment. For example, foam
takeaway containers greatly contribute to coastal marine plastic pollution, constituting ~15% of
plastic collected in beach surveys31. Therefore, foamed food trays and takeaway containers may
benefit from redesigning them to follow the principles of green chemistry and engineering. Given
the diversity of available materials, there is a need to re-evaluate the best choice for the
environment and determine whether alternative materials can do better.
Selection using material indices (MIs).
Material selection using MIs for several functional indicators and environmental impacts can
inform decision-making. Food trays and takeaway containers are formed films and foamed
sheets; thus, for eco-informed material selection, MIs for stiff and strong films and sheets were
evaluated to compare materials used for these items and potential alternative materials. Indices
for material efficiency, material cost efficiency, GHG emissions, energy usage, water usage, and
environmental lifetime were calculated for each material (Supplementary Table 6, Figure 5),
thereby covering a broad range of functional, economic, and environmental design
considerations.
Three key observations resulted from this analysis. First, the MI for environmental lifetime
indicated that CDA foam was optimal (215 times better than PS foam), followed by paper (146
times better than PS foam) and PET (14 times better than PS foam). Second, the MI for embodied
water usage spanned a wide range of values, reflecting the major differences in the water
requirements used by the feedstock and in processing the materials. PP, CDA foam, and PET
were 2, 4, and 6 times less optimal than PS foam, respectively. PLA and paper were even poorer
choices compared to PS foam by 11 and 57 times, respectively. Third, for all other MIs, PS foam
11

was the optimal material. However, the ranges in values for these MIs were far less than for
environmental persistence and water usage. By and large, and in agreement with previous LCAs,
the MIs indicated that PS foam could be the best choice of material when persistence is not a
factor. However, when persistence is considered, CDA foam can be the best choice. As noted,
the current standing of each material was based on what we know now (Supplementary Table
7) and is subject to change with new and improved data. One way for biodegradable bioplastic
foams to be more competitive with PS foams across all these metrics is to attain greater material
efficiency by moving to lower relative densities (<0.10).
Selection by balancing tradeoffs of economic and societal costs.
Tradeoffs between MIs were considered using value functions to systematically evaluate
characteristics with a standard unit, i.e., dollars32. MIs are converted to value using exchange
constants. Owing to available and robust exchange constants33, comparisons were made in terms
of the relative cost of materials and the relative social cost of CO 2 for each material with respect
to PS foam (Figure 5). Regarding the cost of materials, PS foam was the least expensive. The
amounts of other materials used to make food trays and takeaway containers were estimated to
be 4 to 5 times more expensive. This difference translates to an additional cost of material <$0.10
more per item, which is likely negligible to the consumer with respect to the cost of the food held
by the items (e.g., cost of meat34). As for the social cost of CO2, PS foam was the best choice,
being 1.4 to 7.4 times less costly than the other materials. Presently, the latest estimate for the
value of the exchange constant for the social cost of CO2 is 0.22 $USD/kg CO2.33 Scaled to the
annual consumption rate of food trays and takeaway containers used in the U.S., the annual social
costs of CO2 associated with PS foam food trays and takeaway containers were ~$49-98 million
and ~$30-34 million, respectively. To date, no exchange constant exists for the social cost of
water, though the need to determine such a number has been proposed 35. Nonetheless, water is
a valuable natural resource36,37; thus, reducing its usage as much as possible can benefit society.
An initial estimate for the social cost of plastic pollution was proposed to range between 4.58 to
45.8 $USD/yr-kg plastic.38 Based on the range of values for the social cost of plastic pollution, 218% of CDA foam food trays and 15-100% of CDA foam takeaway containers would need to leak
into the environment for the social cost of plastic pollution to exceed the social costs of CO2
(Supplementary Figure 6). A rough estimate for the leakage frequency of plastic foam is ~2%
(calculated as the product of the global plastic leakage frequency, ~11%1, and the proportion of
leaked plastic that is plastic foam, ~15%31). Conversely, for persistent PS foams, only 0.02-0.2%
of food trays and 0.2-2% of takeaway containers would need to leak for the social cost of plastic
pollution to outweigh that of CO2 (Supplementary Figure 6). The difference in the range of
leakage frequency for food trays and takeaway containers was because of their ten times
difference in thickness, which results in different environmental lifetimes and thus different social
costs of plastic pollution (Supplementary Figure 6).
A conservative estimate using the lower bound U.S. annual consumption rates for each item, the
lower bound initial estimate for the social cost of plastic pollution, and assuming only 0.5% of
these items leak into the environment,22 suggests that switching from PS to CDA foam could
equate to annual savings for society due to a reduction in the cost of plastic pollution of ~$1.6
billion for food trays and ~$114 million for takeaway containers. These savings are also
conservative because they do not reflect costs associated with circularity and renewability, as
discussed in the following section. Moreover, regardless of the value of the exchange constant,
the savings to society by using non-persistent materials are inherent; they are baseline savings
that do not rely on changes in consumer behavior or waste management infrastructure.

containers relative to PS foam for various performance and environmental impact categories.
Data points represent the relative MI or value for each material compared to PS foam. All foams
are low-density. Data used for evaluating the MIs (Supplementary Table 6) are included in
Supplementary Table 7. Supplementary Figure 5 includes comparisons to additional materials.
Renewability and circularity considerations.
Selection cannot be made solely using MIs and value. System-level properties of the material and
product must be considered, such as feedstock renewability, end-of-life management, product
recyclability, and circularity39. To fit into a circular economy framework, a renewable feedstock is
one in which the carbon has been recirculated, including carbon obtained from biomass, industrial
by-products, waste CO2, or recycled plastics.39 While all of the plastics discussed can be made in
whole or in part from bio-based feedstocks,40 several are disproportionately petroleum-derived
(PS foam, virgin PET, PP)2. The social costs of petroleum-derived feedstocks extend beyond CO2
emissions, water usage, and environmental persistence discussed above 29. For example, human
and ecosystem health impacts from oil spills41, and methane venting by the oil and gas industry
pose substantial social costs that are not considered in the current framework (Figure 5)42.
Meanwhile, the sustainability of PLA, CDA, and paper feedstocks depends on agricultural
practices, which can vary considerably 40,43–45. CDA has historically been a mixed feedstock
wherein the cellulose was bio-derived, and the carbon within the acetyl modification was derived
from coal. Recognizing the non-renewability of coal as a carbon source for the acetyl functionality,
13

more sustainable grades of CDA are being produced in which the acetyl carbon is derived from
molecularly recycled mixed waste that would otherwise be landfilled.46
Today, the vast majority of managed plastic waste is landfilled12, some is incinerated, and even
less is recycled and composted47. For example, municipal mechanical recycling facilities currently
do not accept foams13,48, resulting in their disposal in landfills or by incineration.12 Landfills
contribute ~10% of global methane emissions, and their leachates can diminish fresh and
groundwater resources49. Although incineration of waste can reclaim embedded energy, the
process releases GHGs and reduces air quality. The social costs of methane emissions and air
pollution were estimated to be $3.5 per kg CH4 (~16 times that of CO2) and to range from $100172 per kg particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) (~450-782 times that of
CO2), respectively50,51. While direct exchange constants for the social costs of landfilling and
waste incineration are challenging due to their dependencies on geographic location and facility
specifications52, these figures for methane and PM 2.5 emissions illustrate the magnitude of their
costs to society and in turn, the potential costs of these waste management strategies.
More circular end-of-life strategies (e.g., recycling and composting) for the materials discussed
require technological advancement, infrastructure investment, and consumer education. Foam
materials can still be disposed of in ways that fit into a circular economy. PS materials, including
PS foams, can be chemically recycled, though such capabilities have yet to become
mainstream48. PET is the most mechanically recycled plastic (~21%, primarily from bottles) and
is the only plastic being molecularly recycled at the commercial scale12,26,53. PP can also be
mechanically recycled12, but so far has been at a reduced frequency (5.5%)26. While mechanical
recycling can be a helpful end-of-life strategy for PET and PP54, using recycled material to produce
new food contact items poses challenges48. Needing to be food-grade can limit the stock of
mechanically recycled plastic available for use in making food trays and takeaway containers. A
similar challenge to the mechanical recycling of plastics is material contamination48, which is
ubiquitous when these materials are used in food applications.
These facts skew the material selection analysis toward materials that can be disposed of
alongside food waste and biodegraded in composting settings. Like PET and PP, paper is also
recyclable but differs in that it is also compostable. Paper products often are coated to prevent
leakage from liquids. These coatings are a recognized shortcoming of paper products, posing
challenges to composters as sources of plastic contamination 55. Historically, they have included
persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 56,57; however, next-generation coatings,
such as biowaxes and PLA, have begun to be phased in 58. PLA can be industrially composted;
however, without improvements in the availability and accessibility of such facilities59, PLA items
may follow a linear lifecycle51. Conversely, CDA can be home-composted60, enabling a broader
range of end-of-life disposal methods for this material. While composting is not a panacea without
environmental impacts,61 it presents a path to circularity for mixed, readily biodegradable organic
waste. Future work should prioritize the development of robust exchange constants for beginningand end-of-life scenarios so their tradeoffs can be compared, like those for GHG emissions, water
usage, and environmental lifetime.
Concluding Remarks
The redesign of plastic products requires considering the choice of material, the form of the
product, and their interactions. The choice of material decides the range of material properties
available. The macroscopic form of the product controls its SA/V and, thus, its environmental
lifetime. Microstructuring (e.g., foaming) expands the range of material properties and increases

the surface area, realizing material efficiency and SA/V optimization. Together, these qualities can
yield designs that inherently minimize many environmental impacts of plastic use.
Many applications benefit from the properties of foams because of their superior material
efficiency, low thermal conductivity, and vibration and impact absorption11. For these reasons,
foams are used in packaging and insulation applications. This study demonstrates another
beneficial property: the accelerated degradation of biodegradable foamed articles. Policymakers
and consumers should thus be wary of generalizing that all plastic foams harm the environment.
Instead, a more nuanced understanding that the leakage of persistent plastics into the
environment is undoubtedly problematic, yet these same materials can be the least impactful with
respect to other environmental impacts compared to alternatives 15,62–64. With that, holistic, systemlevel assessments of environmental impact are required when evaluating alternative solutions 65;
otherwise, one environmental impact may be swapped for another15,63. Decision-making and
policies must be nimble to scientific development, and investigators must soundly communicate
their latest scientific findings to afford opportunities for informed choices.
METHODS
Materials
The CDA materials used in this study included formulated films (1 mil, 5 mil, 10 mil thicknesses),
a film (10 mil thickness) formulated like the others but with the addition of 15 wt% CaCO 3 filler, a
formulated medium density foam (30 mil thickness), and two formulated low-density foams (98
mil and 115 mil thicknesses). The 1 mil CDA film was prepared by solvent casting, while the 5 and
10 mil CDA films were prepared by melt extrusion. The CDA materials were formulated with a
nontoxic, biodegradable additive commonly used as an ingredient in processed foods. All CDA
materials were provided by Eastman. Details on the materials can be found in published patents. 66
PS foams included a medium-density foam (30 mil thickness) and two low-density foams (75 mil
and 150 mil thicknesses) provided by Eastman. All foams were thermoformed. The molecular
weight, and thermomechanical and physical properties of the CDA films and CDA and PS foams
are summarized in Supplementary Tables 2-5. Other materials included a biaxially oriented PP
film (2 mil thickness) sourced from Goodfellow (PP30 grade), a PLA film (10 mil thickness)
provided by Eastman, and a low-density grade, thermally upgraded kraft paper (10 mil thickness)
sourced from the Cottrell Paper Company. PP and PLA films and PS foams were used as negative
controls, and kraft paper was used as a positive control.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
The molecular weight distribution of the CDA and PS materials were measured by GPC using an
Agilent 1260 Infinity II High Pressure Liquid Chromatogram Separations module, with an on-line
ultraviolet (UV) detector fitted with a deuterium lamp operating at 230 nm (Agilent 1260 Infinity II
Variable Wavelength Detector), an interferometric refractometer (Agilent 1260 Infinity II Refractive
Index (RI) Detector) operating at 30 °C with a tungsten lamp, and 5 μm PLgel Guard, MIXED-C,
and Oligopore columns (Polymer Laboratories Inc.) in series. The mobile phase was
tetrahydrofuran (THF) with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) preservative delivered at a 1 mL/min
flow rate. 12.5 mg of the plastic sample was pre-dissolved in 5 mL THF with BHT preservative.
The injection volume was 50 μL. The UV and RI detector signals were simultaneously recorded
using Agilent SEC/GPC software version A.02.01 build 9.34851. The number average molecular
weight (𝑀𝑛 ), weight average molecular weight (𝑀𝑤 ), and dispersity (Đ) were calculated in the
software from the measured molecular weight distribution.

Pore size analysis
Cross-sectional micrographs of the foam samples were captured by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). First, the samples were cryo-sliced and sputter-coated with gold for 4 minutes
under an argon atmosphere. Micrographs were obtained using a TESCAN VEGA SEM with an
acceleration voltage of 5 kV and magnifications between 50 and 500 times. The pore and cell
sizes were determined using a Python-based watershed segmentation script. Micrographs
captured at high magnification that featured >50 distinct pores or cells were used for analysis.
Density and porosity determination
The apparent densities of the foams were provided by Eastman. Relative densities for the foams
were calculated as the ratio of the density of the respective foam to the density of the solid (CDA
= 1.35 g/cm3; PS = 1.05 g/cm3). Porosities for the foams were calculated as one minus their
respective relative density. The density and porosity properties of the foams are summarized in
Supplementary Table 3.
Continuous flow natural seawater mesocosm
Details of the seawater pumping, filtering, and temperature tempering can be found in Mazzotta
et al.19 without modification. The 20 ºC tempered seawater collected in a head tank and flowed to
the mesocosm tanks with an average flow rate of 218 L/hr, yielding a residence time of ~30
minutes. Samples were suspended ~2-3 inches from the bottom of the tank and held by clamps.
Sample geometry
All samples were cut to ~25.4 mm by ~25.4 mm (1 inch by 1 inch) pieces as used previously by
Mazzotta et al.19 Before placement in the mesocosm tank, all samples were massed using a
Mettler Toledo AG245 (readability of 0.1 mg; repeatability of 0.1 mg). The same analytical balance
was used for the entirety of the time series.
Sample collection for mass loss measurements
At designated time points, samples were collected, photographed, and placed into pre-weighed
15 mL glass vials filled with MilliQ water and incubated for ~30 minutes. After the incubation,
samples, and vials were lightly rinsed with copious amounts of MilliQ water to remove detritus.
Then, samples in their respective vials without caps were placed open to dry at 60 ºC for 48 hrs
in an IsoTemp 637G oven (Fisher Scientific). Samples in their vials were then removed from the
oven, closed, allowed to return to room temperature, and massed.
Optical microscopy
Samples were illuminated on a tracing board and imaged using a 5-megapixel digital microscope
(model 44308, Celestron). Images were processed with the U.S. National Institutes of Health
ImageJ software.
Mass loss measurements
Each sample at each time point was evaluated for mass loss in triplicate (Supplementary Tables
8-9). Mass loss was calculated as the relative mass loss (%) being the difference between the
initial mass of the sample (𝑚0 ) and the mass of the sample (𝑚𝑡 ) at the time point (𝑡) normalized
16

to the initial mass of the sample (Equation 1). The relative mass loss (%) of each replicate at
each time point for each article type is included in Supplementary Tables 10-11. Measurements
were reproducible and repeatable over multiple years and seasons (Supplementary Discussion
3, Supplementary Figure 7).
𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 (%) =

𝑚0 − 𝑚𝑡

Mass loss is a reasonable measure for the degradation of CDA materials because it is wellestablished that these materials biodegrade to CO 2 in the coastal ocean19. Additionally, because
SA/V is a control of biodegradation (Supplementary Discussion 1) if any mass loss were
attributed to physical disintegration (fragmentation), this would only increase the fragments’ mass
loss rate (Equation 2). Thus, for mass loss measurements in our continuous flow-through
seawater mesocosm, 𝑘𝑑 was considered the surface erosion rate due to biodegradation
processes. Additionally, samples in our system experienced negligible mechanical deformation
and abrasion; the low flow rates were unable to deflect hanging samples (average flow velocity:
~4 mm/s), indicating a very low shear rate, and the use of seawater filtered to particulate less
than 200 µm in combination with low flow rates presumably minimizes any abrasive removal of
material. Previous experiments have determined that no mass loss occurred in sterilized
controls20.
Surface erosion model
The relative mass loss data was fit to a phenomenological surface erosion model (Equation 2) in
𝜕𝑚
which 𝜕𝑡 is the change in mass with time, 𝑚 is the instantaneous mass, 𝑘𝑑 is the specific surface
degradation rate, 𝐴𝑠 is the surface area, and 𝑉 is the volume22,24.
𝜕𝑚
𝐴𝑠
= −𝑚𝑘𝑑
𝜕𝑡
𝑉

(2)

Equation 2 was solved for a film of initial length 𝑙0 , initial width 𝑤0, and initial thickness ℎ0 and
shifted and scaled using a constant 𝛽 to account for mass loss due to leachable components
(e.g., plasticizer) or other initial jumps in mass loss between the initial mass and the first time
point to yield Equation 3. Thus, the trivial data point of zero mass loss at time zero was excluded
from model fitting.
𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 (%) = 100% [(1 −

(𝑙0 − 2𝑘𝑑 𝑡)(𝑤0 − 2𝑘𝑑 𝑡)(ℎ0 − 2𝑘𝑑 𝑡)
) (1 − 𝛽) + 𝛽]

𝑙0 𝑤0 ℎ0

(3)

𝑙0 and 𝑤0 were assumed to be 25.4 mm for each sample, which is valid because Equation 3 is
largely insensitive to changes in 𝑙0 and 𝑤0 when 𝑙0 >>ℎ0 and 𝑤0>>ℎ0 as is the case for the film
samples.
Regression analyses
The relative mass loss data (Supplementary Tables 10-11) was fit to Equation 3 using nonlinear
least-squares regression. Data sets for the CDA films were fit after a robust regression and outlier
(ROUT) removal step with a coefficient Q of 1% to clean the data of any outlying points
(Supplementary Figure 7). All fits had R2 >0.90. Relative mass loss data for PP and PLA films,
and PS foams were not fit because any mass loss was within the uncertainty of the mass loss

measurements. Instead, mass loss trajectories were constrained for these materials using
specified values of 𝑘𝑑 and the sample’s dimensions. All regressions were performed in GraphPad
Prism 10.1.0 (264). Projected environmental lifetimes (𝑡𝐿 ) were calculated using Equation 4.
𝑡𝐿 =

Material selection
Data was collated from literature sources for material properties not measured in this study
(Supplementary Table 7). Material indices (MIs) used to evaluate the performance and the
environmental impact of the materials were derived for the design of stiffness-limited and strengthlimited films or sheets, for which the free variables were the thickness of the film or sheet and the
choice of material. MIs included those for material efficiency, material cost efficiency, minimal
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, minimal energy usage, minimal water usage, and minimal
environmental lifetime (Supplementary Table 6). To evaluate tradeoffs between MIs, a value
function (𝑉) was used to convert performance to monetary value using exchange constants
(Equation 5)32,
𝑉 = 𝑚0 (𝐶$ + 𝑎𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐶𝐺𝐻𝐺 + 𝑎𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐶𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 + 𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

where 𝑚0 was the initial mass of the item, 𝐶$ was the specific price of the material, 𝑎𝐺𝐻𝐺 was the
social cost of CO233, 𝐶𝐺𝐻𝐺 was the specific embodied GHG emissions of the material, 𝑎𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 was
the social cost of water usage, 𝐶𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 was the specific embodied water usage of the material,
𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 was the product of the frequency for an item to leak into the environment and the social
cost of plastic pollution, ℎ0 was the initial characteristic length (i.e., the thickness of the film or
sheet), and 𝑘𝑑 was the specific surface degradation rate. The relative value was used to calculate
the value of hypothetical items that satisfied the same engineering requirements as a reference
item of known dimensions and mass. The relative value for the nth component of the value
function between the ith material and reference material can be expressed by Equation 632.

Statistical analyses
The Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) was used to determine the probability of whether one
set of model fit parameters adequately described two data sets or whether the model fit
parameters were different for at least one of the data sets. Comparisons between model fit
parameters were conducted using unpaired t-tests. All statistical analyses were performed in
GraphPad Prism 10.1.0 (264) and Microsoft Excel 16.78.3 (23102801). Data are presented as
the mean  standard deviation unless otherwise stated.
