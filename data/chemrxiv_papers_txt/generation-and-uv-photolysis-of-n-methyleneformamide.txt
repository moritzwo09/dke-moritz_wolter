Abstract. Simple imines have been detected in space and are considered as building blocks to larger
heteroaromatic, cyclic and biological relevant compounds. Herein we revisited the formation of the
simplest acylimine, namely N-methyleneformamide, by high-vacuum flash pyrolysis (HVFP) as
well as its spectroscopic characterization by cryogenic matrix isolation infrared (IR) and UV/Vis
spectroscopy. N-methyleneformamide prefers a gauche over a s-trans conformation in contrast to
parent 1,3-butadiene. In UV-photolysis experiments we identified formaldehyde:HCN and
formaldimine:CO complexes as the major decomposition products. As further photolysis products
we observed the HCN:CO and HNC:CO complexes. All experimental findings are supported by
deuterium labeling experiments and high-level ab initio coupled cluster calculations.
N-methyleneformamide should be considered as a candidate for an interstellar search. The sequence
R2C=N–RC=O also occurs in cytosine making the title compound highly relevant for prebiotic
chemistry and the search for the molecular origins of life.

Imines are fundamental building blocks in prebiotic chemistry, e.g., in Strecker’s amino acid
synthesis or in the HCN dimerization and adenine forming Ferris Orgel reaction.1–3 Simple imines
are continuously discovered in space, including formaldimine (H2C=NH, 1),4 cyanomethanimine
(NCHC=NH, 2)5 and others (Scheme 1).6–9 Only last year the high energy isomer of the HCN dimer
2, namely N-cyanomethanimine (H2C=NCN, 3) including the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone
was discovered in space.10 This provides evidence that other differently substituted methanimines
might also be present in space including N-methyleneformamide (4). Computational studies predict

N-methyleneformamide is the simplest N-acylimine and was already part of theoretical13–19 and
experimental investigations.20 It is noteworthy that the sequence R2C=N–RC=O also occurs in the
nucleobase cytosine, making 4 highly relevant for the field of prebiotic chemistry.
N-methyleneformamide was previously generated from a cyclopentadiene based precursor in a
retro-aza-Diels-Alder reaction at 450 °C in the gas-phase under high-vacuum and characterized
using low-temperature infrared spectroscopy.20 However, only the two most prominent vibrations,
namely the CO and CN stretching vibration at 1735 and 1695 cm–1, were observed in a solid film.
Even in the condensed phase and in the absence of a solvent, 4 showed propensity to polymerize at
–196 °C. Due to the high reactivity, a low temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum
could not be reported in contrast to other reactive N-acylmethanimines.20 In a mass spectrometric
and microwave spectroscopic study only trans-nitrosoethylene (H2CHCNO) could be identified as
the elusive C2H3NO isomer.21 To the best of our knowledge a microwave spectrum of 4 is not yet
reported, despite its high dipole moment of 3.0 D (gauche, B3LYP/6-311+G**).18

N-methyleneformamide is a 1,3-butadiene heteroanalog, preferring a gauche over a planar s-trans
conformation according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.18,19 The presence of both,
an imino and a carbonyl functional group gives 4 a rotational profile around the C=N–C=O dihedral
angle, which is at odds with other (hetero)butadiene analogs.22 The energetic preference for the
gauche conformer was rationalized with electronic repulsion effects.11 The repulsive interactions
are greater than the conjugation effect in the two planar conformations of 4.18,19 Only recently, the
non-planar gauche preference for parent 1,3-butadiene was demonstrated experimentally in a
Fourier-transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy study.23 The lower energy s-trans conformer
does not possess a dipole moment and is invisible to radio astronomy. However, the cyano tagged
butadiene analog, namely s-trans-E-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, was observed in TMC-1 in 2023
suggesting that also more heteroatom substituted butadienes might be present in space.24

Panda et al. explored various C2H3NO isomers in the context of interstellar chemistry.
Methylisocyanate (H3CNCO), glycolonitrile (HOCH2CN), 4 and 2-iminoacetaldehyde
(HC(O)CHNH) were identified as the lowest energy C2H3NO isomers.11 We reported recently the
spectroscopic characterization of interstellar relevant imines by UV photolysis of the corresponding
azide precursors.25–27 In the UV photolysis of 2-azidoacetaldehyde we identified
2-iminoacetaldehyde and two unassigned bands at 993.7 and 1469.9 cm−1 that did not show any

characterized by two bands, we revisited the preparation of 4 and investigated its photochemistry.

(HVFP) of N-formyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene (5) and 5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-oxazine (6) and
subsequent trapping of all pyrolysis products in solid argon at 3.4 K. UV irradiation (λ ≤ 308 nm)
of the matrix leads to the decomposition of 4 into formaldimine (1) and CO as well as formaldehyde
(7) and HCN.

For the generation of 4 we synthesized N-formyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene (5) as described by
Lasne et al. including the 3,3-deuterium isotopically labelled compound (Scheme S1).20 We
performed high-vacuum flash pyrolysis (HVFP) experiments with 5 at 450 °C and directly trapped
all pyrolysis products with an excess of argon on a cold matrix window at 3.4 K (Scheme 2). Besides
the well-known signals of matrix isolated cyclopentadiene (8) in argon,28 we identified another set
of signals at 2956.8, 2908.0, 2873.7, 1719.4, 1664.0, 1473.1, 1372.6, 1196.1, 1057.0, 1030.5, 992.6,
786.6 cm–1 (Table S1), which we assigned to the fundamentals of gauche-4 based on our calculation
of gauche-4 at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level of theory (Figure S1, Table S1). There is no
spectroscopic evidence for s-trans-4 in our pyrolysis spectrum. Cyclopentadiene and gauche-4 are
the retro-aza-Diels-Alder reaction products of 5. We irradiated the matrix with UV light (λ = 254
nm, 40 min) and observed a 40% decomposition of gauche-4 along with the reported disrotatory
photoinduced intramolecular cycloaddition of 8 forming bicyclo[2.1.0]pent-2-ene (BCP) as
observed by its two most intense bands at 774 and 720 cm–1 (Figure S2) .28 We identified complexed
formaldimine29 and carbon monoxide as well as the reported HCN-formaldehyde complex30 as the
primary photolysis products of gauche-4 (Figure S2).

As we observed critical overlaps in the IR spectrum of gauche-4 with 8 and its photochemistry, we
investigated another precursor for the generation of gauche-4. In the [4+2] retro-aza-Diels-Alder
reaction of 5, cyclopentadiene takes the role of the diene and 4 of the dienophile. We synthesized
5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-oxazine (6) as an alternative precursor (Scheme S2). In the corresponding
[4+2] retro-aza-Diels-Alder reaction ethylene and 4 should be the reaction products as dieneophile
and diene, respectively. The oxazine heterocycle is highly sensitive and polymerizes as a neat liquid
even at –26 °C in the dark within three days. We conducted HVFP experiments with 6 in the
450-750 °C temperature range (Scheme 2). The compound is more stable than 5 and starts
decomposing at around 650 °C. At 750 °C we identified the same set of signals for gauche-4 as
described in the pyrolysis of 5 as the major pyrolysis product along with the characteristic sets of
signals for ethylene,31 HCN, formaldehyde, formaldimine, CO and not decomposed starting
material (Figure S3). In contrast to 8, ethylene and the other pyrolysis side products do not show

any photochemistry after UV irradiation (λ > 254 nm), and we observed a difference spectrum after
photolysis of gauche-4 only (Figure 1). The tiny signals in Figure 1, which are pointing downwards
and are marked with an asterisk (*) at 3419.0, 2111.6, and 1978.3 cm–1 are assigned to the
corresponding overtone signals of the fundamentals of gauche-4 at 1719.4, 1057.0, and
992.6 cm–1. The characteristic signal in the carbonyl region at 1779.2 cm–1 is a combinational band
of the fundamentals at 992.6 and 786.6 cm–1. After prolonged photolysis we also identified the
HCN:CO and HNC:CO complexes as further photolysis products.32 We assume that IR inactive
dihydrogen forms together with these complexes.

To provide further spectroscopic evidence for the generation of gauche-4, we synthesized
3,3-deuterium labelled N-formyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene (5-d2). The compound can easily
be prepared by reducing Vince lactam33 (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, 9) with lithium
aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4) and subsequent formylation (Scheme S1).20 We carried out the
pyrolysis experiments with the deuterium labeled compound in a similar fashion and assigned a

calculations (Table S2, Figure S4). Irradiation of the matrix with 254 nm results in disappearance
of the described signals and the formation of complexed formaldimine-d229 (D2CNH) and CO as
well as a DCN:formaldehyde-d1 complex (Figure S5).

We also repeated the pyrolysis experiments with 6 and conducted UV/Vis spectroscopy
experiments with the trapped pyrolysis products. As the UV/Vis absorptions of 8 show critical
overlaps in the UV region with the calculated transitions of gauche-4, precursor 6 is more suitable
for UV/Vis experiments than 5. The major pyrolysis side product, ethylene, shows absorption below
200 nm,34 as well as the other minor by-products formaldehyde,35 HCN,36 and CO.37 Only
methylene imine has a transition at around 250 nm,38 however in the pyrolysis IR spectrum it is
observed only in traces (Figure S3). Precursor 6 has a calculated weak transition at λ = 218 nm
(oscillator strength f = 0.006) at the TD-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory that is in a very
good agreement with our experimental UV/Vis spectrum in argon (λmax = 211 nm, Figure S11). For
gauche-4 we calculated transitions at the same level of theory at λ = 299 nm (f = 0.003), λ = 244 nm
(f = 0.001), and λ = 218 nm (f = 0.023) (Table S3). After 15 min pyrolysis of 6, we recorded the
black spectrum depicted in Figure 2 with three absorption maxima at λmax = 288 nm, λmax = 251 nm,

and λmax = 203 nm. The two experimental absorptions at λmax = 288 and λmax = 251 nm are in good
agreement with the calculated transition while the absorption maximum at λmax = 203 nm overlaps
with the absorption of undecomposed precursor 6 (Figure S11). After irradiation of the matrix with
λ = 308 nm for 150 min all bands decreased while no new signals appeared (vide supra) as depicted
in the red curve in Figure 2.

We calculated the most essential part of the potential energy surface (PES) around 4 at the DLPNOCCSD(T)/CBS//B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory including zero-point vibrational energy
(ZPVE) corrections (Figure 3). The barrier for the decomposition of 6 in the retro-aza-Diels-Alder
reaction is 50.4 kcal mol–1 (TS1) and is associated with the formation of 4 and ethylene. We located
another transition state TS2 that is much higher in energy (81.1 kcal mol–1) and connects precursor
6 directly to 7, CO and ethylene. The imaginary frequency of TS2 resembles a ring breathing
vibration in 6. For 5 the barrier for the retro-aza-Diels-Alder reaction is 43.3 kcal mol–1 (TS6, Figure
S31). This is in good agreement with our experimental results, as 5 already decomposed at much
lower temperature (vide supra). There are two conformers for 4, namely gauche and s-trans. The
planar s-trans conformer is 1.4 kcal mol–1 higher in energy, while the planar s-cis conformation
represents a transition state (1.6 kcal mol–1), which connects two gauche minima of 4 in a double
valley (c.f. Figure S32 for a relaxed scan of the electronic energy of the τ(CNCO) dihedral angle).

The dihedral angle τ(CNCO) in gauche 4 is (–)54.2° calculated at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level of
theory (Figure 3). The gauche and s-trans conformers of 4 are connected via TS4 and a small 1.6
kcal mol–1 barrier. The small barrier and the high energy nature of s-trans 4 (1.4 kcal mol–1) are a
reasonable explanation why we only observed the gauche conformer in our low temperature matrix
isolation experiments. We located two high energy transition states TS4 (71.3 kcal mol–1) and TS5
(69.0 kcal mol–1) that are associated with the dissociation of 4 into 1 and CO as well as 7 and HCN.
All dissociation products were identified in our pyrolysis spectrum.

In summary, we report the full matrix isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic characterization of
gauche N-methyleneformamide and its photochemical UV light induced fragmentation into
formaldehyde:HCN and formaldimine:CO complexes. As further decomposition products we
observed the HCN:CO and HNC:CO complexes. In contrast to parent 1,3-butadiene
N-methyleneformamide prefers a gauche over a s-trans conformation. N-methyleneformamide is a
promising candidate for interstellar detection. To facilitate an interstellar search, the molecule
should be characterized by rotational spectroscopy to provide the necessary laboratory rotational
transitions. If this compound is formed in laboratory astrochemistry experiments or is directly
observed in space, it would suggest a possible connection between simple acylimines and larger
biologically relevant molecules, such as cytosine as a nucleobase in which the sequence R2C=N–
RC=O appears. This discovery could potentially increase the complexity of prebiotic molecules of
interest to astrobiology and the search for the molecular origins of life.
