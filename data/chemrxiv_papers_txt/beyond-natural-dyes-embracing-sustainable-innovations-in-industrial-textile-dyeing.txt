1. Introduction
The textile industry is one of the most influential sectors in the global economy, producing an
incredible variety of fabrics and garments that are used daily. A key part of this industry is the dyeing
process, which give fabrics their vibrant colors and eye-catching patterns that consumers love. In 2023,
the global market for textile dyes was valued at around USD 9.6 billion, and it is expected to keep
growing as demand for textiles continue to rise [1].
However, the heavy use of dyes come with significant environmental issues. Dyeing processes
consume a lot of resources and produce substantial wastewater, which could be highly polluting if
not managed properly [2]. Effective management of dye waste is crucial to reduce these
environmental impacts and promote sustainable practices within the textile industry.
Currently, various methods are employed to clean dye-contaminated water before it is released into
the environment. These methods include adsorption, biological degradation, photocatalysis, and
advanced oxidation processes. Adsorption, using materials like activated carbon and bio adsorbents,
is known for being effective in removing different dyes from wastewater [3,4]. Biological methods,
such as using microbes to break down complex dye molecules into less harmful substances, provide
an eco-friendly alternative [5]. Photocatalysis, which involve light-activated catalysts, and advanced
oxidation processes that create highly reactive species to degrade dyes, has also shown promise in
both lab and pilot-scale studies [6-8].
Despite these advances, dye waste removal is not the ultimate fix. Each method has its own set of
limitations when it come to the range of dyes they could effectively remove and their overall
efficiency [9]. For instance, the materials used in adsorption could become saturated and require
costly and time-consuming regeneration [10]. Scaling these technologies up for industrial use is
another obstacle, as adsorbents which work well in the lab often lose efficiency on a larger scale [11].
Additionally, the economic costs of implementing and maintaining these technologies are significant,
making it difficult for many textile manufacturers to afford [12]. As a result, while dye waste removal
methods are important, they do not tackle the root cause of pollution and often add complexity and
cost to textile production [13, 14]. This situation underscores the need for more sustainable dyeing
processes that minimize waste right from the start.

Recently, there has been growing interest in natural dyes, which are derived from plants, insects,
and minerals. Researchers had explored various methods to improve the extraction procedures and
enhance the yield of these natural dyes. Techniques such as enzymatic extraction, ultrasound-assisted
extraction, and the use of eco-friendly solvents has shown promise in increasing the efficiency and
yield of natural dye extraction [15, 16]. For instance, enzymatic extraction uses specific enzymes to
break down plant cell walls, thereby releasing more dye compounds [17]. Ultrasound-assisted
extraction employ ultrasonic waves to disrupt plant tissues, enhancing the release of dye molecules
[18]. Additionally, researchers experimented with different eco-friendly solvents to replace traditional
toxic solvents, making the extraction process greener [19, 20]. Moreover, advancements in
biotechnology had enabled the genetic modification of dye-producing plants to increase their dye
content, further improving the yield [21]. Some studies also focused on optimizing extraction
parameters such as temperature, pH, and extraction time to maximize dye yield and quality [22-23].
Despite these advancements, natural dye extraction still faces several significant drawbacks that
hinder its widespread industrial use. The variability in dye yield and quality due to differences in raw
material sources, the complexity of extraction procedures, and the higher costs associated with
natural dye production are major challenges [24]. Moreover, natural dyes often had lower color
fastness compared to synthetic dyes, making them less durable and limiting their application in the
textile industry [25]. Consequently, while natural dye extraction had made progress, it remains
insufficient for meeting the demands of large-scale textile production.
In this paper, a deeper analysis of the natural dye extraction process and its limitations will be
provided. However, greater emphasis will be placed on the development and optimization of ecofriendly industrial dyeing techniques using synthetic dyes, as this approach offers a more realistic
solution to the sustainability challenges faced by the textile industry.
2. Natural dye extraction
2.1 Discovery of Novel Extraction Methods of Natural Dyes
In recent years, the extraction of natural dyes has seen significant advancements, with researchers
developing innovative methods to improve yield, efficiency, and environmental impact. These novel
techniques have been explored and refined to address the limitations of traditional extraction
processes, such as low yield, high energy consumption, and the use of toxic solvents.
One promising method is enzymatic extraction, which utilizes specific enzymes to break down
plant cell walls, releasing more dye compounds. A study by El-Dein et al. (2018) demonstrated the
efficacy of enzymatic extraction from red prickly pear, achieving higher dye yields compared to
conventional methods. The use of enzymes such as pectinase and cellulase not only improved yield
but also reduced the extraction time significantly [17]. The main advantage of enzymatic extraction is
its eco-friendliness and efficiency, but the cost and availability of specific enzymes can be a drawback.
Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has also gained attention for its ability to enhance the release
of dye molecules from plant materials. Haji (2010) reported that UAE improved the extraction
efficiency of natural dyes from various plant sources. The ultrasonic waves disrupt plant cell walls,
facilitating the release of dye compounds and increasing the overall yield [18]. UAE is noted for its
reduced extraction time and lower solvent usage, making it a more sustainable option. However, the
initial investment in ultrasound equipment can be high, and the method's scalability remains a
concern.
Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is another innovative technique that has been investigated
for its effectiveness in natural dye extraction. A study by Ko et al. (2021) showed that MAE could
extract anthocyanins from black rice with higher efficiency and shorter extraction times compared to
traditional methods. The microwave energy rapidly heats the plant material, causing cell rupture and
enhancing dye release [26]. MAE offers the benefits of reduced extraction time and energy
consumption, but the high cost of microwave equipment and potential for uneven heating are
challenges that need to be addressed.
Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) has emerged as a cutting-edge method for extracting natural
dyes using supercritical CO2 as a solvent. Research by Chatterjee et al. (2019) demonstrated that SFE

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ztldb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5176-7422 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

could efficiently extract carotenoids from marigold flowers, achieving high purity and yield [27]. SFE
is praised for its non-toxic and non-flammable nature, making it an environmentally friendly option.
However, the high operational pressures and costs associated with supercritical CO2 equipment can
be limiting factors.
Another noteworthy method is the use of eco-friendly solvents such as deep eutectic solvents (DES).
Dai et al. (2020) investigated the use of DES for extracting flavonoids from lotus leaves, finding that
this method enhanced extraction efficiency and yield [28]. DES are biodegradable and less toxic
compared to conventional solvents, offering a greener alternative for natural dye extraction.
Nevertheless, the relatively new nature of DES means that more research is needed to fully
understand their long-term environmental impact and optimize their use.

Figure 1. Using biomass drying and extraction methods for extracting various natural dyes.

Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) has also shown promise in the field of natural dye extraction. A
study by Mustafa et al. (2021) highlighted the effectiveness of PLE in extracting phenolic compounds
from olive leaves. The method involves using high-pressure liquids at elevated temperatures to
enhance extraction efficiency [29]. PLE offers the advantage of reduced solvent usage and faster
extraction times, but the requirement for specialized equipment and the potential for thermal
degradation of sensitive compounds are drawbacks.
Furthermore, the integration of biotechnological approaches, such as the genetic modification of
dye-producing plants, has been explored to increase dye content and facilitate extraction. Zhang and
Laursen (2005) reported on the development of stable natural colorants through genetic modification,
which can potentially improve yield and consistency in dye quality [21]. While this approach holds
great promise, ethical concerns and regulatory hurdles associated with genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) must be considered.
In addition, recent studies have investigated the use of pulsed electric field (PEF) extraction, which
applies short bursts of high voltage to plant cells, causing them to rupture and release dye
compounds. A study by Barba et al. (2019) demonstrated that PEF could enhance the extraction of
betalains from beetroot, achieving higher yields and preserving the stability of the dye compounds
[30]. PEF is advantageous due to its low energy consumption and minimal solvent use, though the
initial setup cost for PEF equipment is a potential limitation.
Another innovative method is subcritical water extraction (SWE), which uses water at elevated
temperatures and pressures below its critical point to extract dyes. Shu et al. (2020) explored SWE for
extracting polyphenolic compounds from pomegranate peels, showing that this method could

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ztldb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5176-7422 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

achieve high extraction efficiency and purity [31]. SWE is environmentally friendly and avoids the use
of organic solvents, but the high temperatures required can sometimes lead to the degradation of
heat-sensitive compounds.
Lastly, ionic liquid-based extraction (ILE) has been gaining traction as an efficient method for
natural dye extraction. A study by Sun et al. (2021) reported on the use of ionic liquids to extract
anthocyanins from purple sweet potatoes, achieving high yields and excellent stability of the
extracted dyes [32]. Ionic liquids are tunable solvents that can be designed for specific extraction tasks,
but their high cost and potential environmental impact require careful consideration.
Comparing these methods, it is evident that each has its unique advantages and challenges.
Enzymatic extraction and UAE offer eco-friendly and efficient alternatives but may be limited by cost
and scalability. MAE and SFE provide rapid and high-purity extraction but require significant initial
investment in equipment. The use of eco-friendly solvents like DES and PLE represents a move
towards greener extraction technologies, although further research and optimization are needed.
Biotechnological approaches, while promising, bring their own set of ethical and regulatory
challenges. PEF, SWE, and ILE each offer innovative solutions with their own specific benefits and
drawbacks, adding to the diverse toolkit available for natural dye extraction.
In summary, the recent advancements in natural dye extraction methods have significantly
improved yield and sustainability. However, each method presents its own set of trade-offs, and
further research is necessary to address these limitations. A deeper analysis of these methods and
their applications will be provided in the following sections of this paper.

2.2 Criticism of Natural Dye Extraction Methods in Industrial Applicability
The pursuit of natural dye extraction methods has garnered significant attention in recent years,
driven by the desire for more sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic dyes. While
numerous innovative techniques have been developed to enhance the yield and efficiency of natural
dye extraction, their practical applicability in the textile industry remains fraught with challenges.
This section provides a comprehensive critique of natural dye extraction methods from the
perspective of industrial applicability.
One of the foremost challenges associated with natural dye extraction is the economic viability of
these methods. The cost of raw materials, the complexity of extraction procedures, and the need for
specialized equipment often result in higher production costs compared to synthetic dyes. Techniques
such as enzymatic extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and microwave-assisted
extraction (MAE) require significant investment in specific enzymes, ultrasonic equipment, and
microwave devices, respectively [17-18, 26]. These costs can be prohibitive for large-scale industrial
applications, where cost-effectiveness is a critical factor.
Natural dye extraction methods frequently suffer from variability in yield and dye quality. Factors
such as the source and quality of raw materials, seasonal variations, and differences in plant species
can lead to inconsistencies in the final product [17-18, 21]. For instance, enzymatic extraction and UAE
may produce high yields under controlled laboratory conditions, but replicating these results on an
industrial scale can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of natural sources. This variability can
affect the reproducibility and standardization of dyeing processes, making it difficult to achieve
consistent color quality in textile products.

The implementation of advanced extraction techniques such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE),
pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), and pulsed electric field (PEF) extraction in industrial settings
presents numerous technical and operational challenges. These methods often require high-pressure
and high-temperature conditions, which can be difficult to maintain and control on a large scale [2729]. Additionally, the need for specialized equipment and infrastructure can pose significant logistical
and operational hurdles, limiting the scalability of these technologies.
While natural dyes are often perceived as more environmentally friendly than synthetic dyes, the
extraction processes themselves can pose environmental and safety concerns. Some methods, such as
the use of deep eutectic solvents (DES) and ionic liquids, involve chemicals that may have unknown
long-term environmental impacts [28, 32]. Moreover, the disposal of waste products and by-products
generated during the extraction process can create additional environmental burdens. Ensuring the
safety and sustainability of these extraction methods requires comprehensive environmental
assessments and the development of effective waste management strategies.
Natural dyes typically exhibit lower color fastness and durability compared to synthetic dyes. This
limitation is a significant drawback for industrial applications, where textile products must meet high
standards of performance and longevity. The inferior fastness properties of natural dyes can result in
fading and degradation over time, reducing the aesthetic and functional value of dyed fabrics [25].
This issue necessitates additional treatments or the use of fixatives, which can further complicate the
dyeing process and increase production costs.
Despite the advancements in natural dye extraction techniques, scaling these methods for industrial
production remains a formidable challenge. The transition from laboratory-scale experiments to fullscale industrial operations requires extensive optimization and validation. Many natural dye
extraction methods have yet to demonstrate their feasibility on an industrial scale, with issues such as
process efficiency, throughput, and integration into existing manufacturing systems still unresolved
[19, 30]. The scalability of these methods is crucial for their widespread adoption in the textile
industry.
In conclusion, while natural dye extraction methods offer promising alternatives to synthetic dyes,
their applicability in the textile industry is limited by several critical factors (Table 1). High
production costs, variability in yield and quality, technical and operational challenges, environmental
and safety concerns, limitations in color fastness, and scalability issues all pose significant barriers to
their industrial adoption. To effectively address the sustainability challenges in the textile industry, it
is imperative to focus on developing and optimizing eco-friendly synthetic dyeing processes that can
deliver consistent, high-quality results at an industrial scale. This paper will further explore these
alternatives and propose strategies for enhancing the sustainability of textile dyeing.

3.1 Advancements in machinery, digital methods, and physical processes
Technological advancements have significantly contributed to the development of more sustainable
textile dyeing methods. Among these, digital printing, supercritical CO2 dyeing, foam dyeing, highefficiency dyeing machines, and air-dye technology stand out for their potential to reduce
environmental impact and improve efficiency.
Digital printing has revolutionized the textile industry by applying dyes or pigments directly onto
fabrics using inkjet technology. This method drastically reduces the need for water and chemicals, as
the dyes are precisely deposited onto the fabric, minimizing waste. Research indicates that digital
printing can significantly reduce water and chemical consumption compared to traditional dyeing
methods [33-34]. Additionally, digital printing offers high design flexibility and rapid production
times, achieving high print resolutions and color accuracies [34]. However, the technology must
improve in terms of speed and scalability to compete with conventional dyeing methods for largescale production. The high cost of digital inks remains a barrier, necessitating advancements to make
them more affordable without compromising quality.
Supercritical CO2 dyeing represents another significant innovation, using carbon dioxide in its
supercritical state as a solvent for dyeing textiles. In this state, CO2 effectively dissolves dyes and
penetrates textile fibers, eliminating the need for water and significantly reducing chemical usage.
Studies have shown that supercritical CO2 dyeing can eliminate water consumption entirely and
reduce energy and auxiliary chemical use, with dye exhaustion rates comparable to conventional
methods [35-36]. Despite these advantages, the high initial investment costs for equipment and the
need for precise control of temperature and pressure present challenges. Research into more costeffective equipment and improved scalability is necessary for broader industrial adoption [36-37].

transducer and read-out; (d) extraction vessel; (e) quartz sample vial; (f) entraining rotor; (g) aqueous
sample; (h) magnetic drive; (i) restrictor; (j) collection solvent; (k) oven [35].
Foam dyeing employs foam as a medium to apply dyes to textiles, significantly reducing water
consumption. The foam is generated by mixing air with a liquid dye solution, which is then spread
over the fabric. This method reduces the amount of dye and water required and minimizes energy
use, as less heat is needed to dry the fabric. Foam dyeing has been successfully used for various types
of textiles, including denim, demonstrating substantial reductions in water and dye usage [38].
However, the initial setup cost for foam dyeing equipment can be high, and further research is
needed to improve the uniformity and consistency of dye application.

High efficiency dyeing machines have also made a significant impact on sustainable textile dyeing.
These machines are designed to optimize water and energy use, reduce dye and chemical
consumption, and minimize waste. Innovations include low liquor ratio machines and continuous
dyeing processes, which significantly enhance the sustainability of textile production. New dyeing
machines have demonstrated reductions in water consumption and energy usage compared to
traditional methods. Despite these benefits, the high initial cost of these machines and the need for
specialized training to operate them efficiently are challenges that need to be addressed [39].
Air-dye technology is another promising development, using air to apply dyes to textiles and
thereby eliminating the need for water in the dyeing process. This technology significantly reduces
water consumption and minimizes the use of chemicals [40]. Additionally, air-dye technology allows
for precise control of dye application, resulting in less waste and higher efficiency. However, the
scalability of air-dye technology for mass production remains a challenge, and the high cost of
implementation can be a barrier for widespread adoption.
In conclusion, technological innovations in textile dyeing, such as digital printing, supercritical CO2
dyeing, foam dyeing, high-efficiency dyeing machines, and air-dye technology, offer significant
environmental and efficiency benefits. These technologies reduce water and chemical usage, lower
energy consumption, and minimize waste, making them crucial for the sustainable future of the
textile industry. However, challenges such as high initial costs, scalability, and the need for further
research and development persist. Common endeavors in this field should focus on making these
technologies more cost-effective, scalable, and accessible to ensure their broader adoption and
implementation in industrial settings.

3.2 Chemical and Biological Innovations in Dyeing Processes
Chemical and biological innovations have made significant strides in promoting sustainable
practices in textile dyeing. These advancements focus on developing new chemicals, alternative
solvents, and biological processes that reduce environmental impact and enhance efficiency. This
section reviews four key innovations: reactive dyes with high fixation rates, enzymatic processes,
nanotechnology in dyeing, and ionic liquid-based extraction.
Reactive dyes with high fixation rates (Figure 2) represent an important chemical innovation. These
dyes form strong covalent bonds with textile fibers, resulting in higher dye uptake and reduced
effluent pollution. Studies have demonstrated that using reactive dyes with high fixation rates can
decrease water and energy consumption during the dyeing process [41-42]. Despite their benefits, the
development of reactive dyes that maintain high fixation rates across a wide range of fiber types and
dyeing conditions remains a priority for ongoing research [43].

Figure 3. Chemical structure of the reactive disperse dye [41].

Enzymatic processes utilize natural enzymes to assist in textile dyeing, offering an eco-friendly
alternative to traditional chemical treatments. Enzymes such as laccase and peroxidase can break
down complex dye molecules, facilitating more efficient dyeing and reducing the need for harsh
chemicals [44]. Research has shown that enzymatic processes can improve dye uptake, color fastness,
and fabric quality while minimizing environmental impact [45]. However, the high cost of enzyme
production and the need for optimized conditions for each enzyme type are challenges that must be
overcome [46].
Nanotechnology in dyeing involves the use of nano-sized dye particles that can penetrate fibers
more effectively, enhancing dye uptake and fixation. This technology not only improves the efficiency
of the dyeing process but also reduces the amount of dye required, thereby minimizing waste [47].
Studies have highlighted the potential of nanotechnology to enhance the durability and color fastness
of dyed textiles, making it a promising area for future development [47]. Nonetheless, concerns about
the environmental and health impacts of nanoparticles need to be addressed through rigorous safety
evaluations and regulatory frameworks [48].
Ionic liquid-based extraction (ILE) has emerged as an innovative method for extracting natural dyes
using ionic liquids as solvents. Ionic liquids are known for their unique properties, such as low
volatility and high thermal stability, making them suitable for sustainable dye extraction processes
[49]. Research has demonstrated that ILE can enhance dye extraction efficiency and yield while
reducing the use of toxic solvents [49]. However, the high cost of ionic liquids and the need for
further studies on their long-term environmental impact are barriers to widespread adoption [50].
Chemical and biological innovations in textile dyeing offer significant potential for reducing
environmental impact and enhancing process efficiency. These advancements provide promising
alternatives to conventional dyeing methods, but challenges such as high costs, scalability, and safety
concerns must be addressed. Collaborative efforts in research and development are essential to
overcome these barriers and promote the broader adoption of these sustainable dyeing technologies.

3.3 Process Efficiency and Water Conservation in Dyeing Methods
Process efficiency and water conservation are critical components of sustainable textile dyeing.
Innovations in these areas aim to optimize resource usage, minimize waste, and reduce the overall
environmental footprint of the dyeing process. This section reviews four key advancements: low
liquor ratio dyeing, waterless dyeing technologies, closed-loop systems, and advanced oxidation
processes.
Low liquor ratio dyeing is an approach designed to minimize the amount of water used in the
dyeing process. By using a lower volume of water relative to the weight of the fabric, this method
significantly reduces water consumption and the amount of dye and chemicals required. Studies have
shown that low liquor ratio dyeing can reduce water usage by up to 50% compared to traditional
methods [51-52]. Furthermore, this method provides better dye deagglomeration compared to the
traditional methods (Figure 3). However, achieving consistent color quality can be challenging with
reduced water volumes [51].

Waterless dyeing technologies, such as supercritical CO2 dyeing and air-dye technology, have been
developed to eliminate the need for water in the dyeing process entirely. These technologies use
alternative mediums, such as carbon dioxide or air, to apply dyes to textiles. Supercritical CO2 dyeing,
for instance, uses CO2 in its supercritical state to dissolve dyes and penetrate textile fibers, offering a
water-free and energy-efficient dyeing method [53]. Air-dye technology employs air to transfer dyes
onto fabrics, significantly reducing water and chemical use [54]. While these methods offer substantial
environmental benefits, high initial investment costs and the need for specialized equipment can limit
their widespread adoption [53-54].
Closed-loop systems represent another significant innovation in process efficiency and water
conservation. These systems are designed to recycle and reuse water and chemicals within the dyeing
process, thereby reducing the overall consumption of these resources. Research indicates that closedloop systems can recover up to 90% of the water used in dyeing, significantly reducing the
environmental impact [55]. Additionally, these systems can improve process efficiency by
maintaining consistent dye concentrations and minimizing waste. The main challenge associated with
closed-loop systems is the need for advanced filtration and treatment technologies to ensure the
quality and purity of recycled water and chemicals [56].

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are chemical treatments that use highly reactive species, such
as hydroxyl radicals, to degrade organic pollutants in wastewater. These processes are effective in
breaking down complex dye molecules, making them suitable for treating dye effluents and
enhancing water conservation. AOPs, such as photocatalysis and Fenton reactions, have been shown
to achieve high degradation rates of dye pollutants, improving the overall efficiency of wastewater
treatment [57-58]. However, the implementation of AOPs requires careful control of reaction
conditions and the management of by-products, which can add complexity to the process [58].
In conclusion, advancements in process efficiency and water conservation, such as low liquor ratio
dyeing, waterless dyeing technologies, closed-loop systems, and advanced oxidation processes, play a
crucial role in promoting sustainable textile dyeing. These innovations reduce water and chemical
usage, minimize waste, and enhance the overall sustainability of the dyeing process. However,
challenges such as high initial costs, technical complexity, and the need for advanced infrastructure
must be addressed to facilitate the broader adoption of these technologies. Continued research and
development efforts are essential to overcome these barriers and achieve more sustainable textile
dyeing practices.

4. Emerging Innovative Technologies in Eco-Friendly Dyeing
As the textile industry progresses towards greater sustainability, several innovative technologies
have emerged that promise to revolutionize eco-friendly dyeing processes. These advancements,
thoroughly studied and showing significant potential, aim to reduce environmental impact while
maintaining or enhancing dyeing efficiency. This section highlights three such promising
technologies: plasma technology, digital textile printing with biodegradable inks, and microbial
dyeing.
Plasma technology is gaining recognition as a sustainable method for textile surface modification.
This technology uses ionized gas to alter the surface properties of textile fibers, enhancing dye uptake
and fixation without the need for water or chemicals (Figure 5). By significantly reducing water and
chemical consumption, plasma technology also improves dye adherence and color fastness. Plasma
treatment has demonstrated substantial improvements in the hydrophilicity of polyester fabrics,
leading to enhanced dye uptake and uniformity [59]. Additionally, plasma-treated cotton fibers have
shown improved color fastness and reduced dye bleeding, making the process highly effective for
various textile materials [60]. However, the high initial setup costs and the need for specialized
equipment present significant challenges. Further research is necessary to optimize plasma
parameters for different textile materials and dye types to fully realize its potential

treatment (d) 20 min plasma treatment (e) 60 min plasma treatment. Showing rougher surface as plasma
treatment indicate better dying uptake and fixation efficiency [59].

Digital textile printing, already recognized for its environmental benefits, has been further enhanced
by the development of biodegradable inks. These inks, derived from natural sources, are designed to
degrade harmlessly after use, thereby minimizing environmental impact. This method offers precise
dye application with minimal waste, maintaining high print resolution and color accuracy. Recent
developments have produced biodegradable inks using natural pigments and binders, achieving
vibrant colors and excellent print quality on various fabrics [61]. Studies have also confirmed the
biodegradability of these inks, showing that they decompose without leaving harmful residues [62].
The stability and performance of biodegradable inks over time need to be ensured, and efforts are
required to scale up production and reduce costs to make these inks more accessible.
Microbial dyeing leverages the capabilities of microorganisms to produce natural dyes through
fermentation processes. This method provides a sustainable alternative to synthetic dyes by using
renewable resources. Microbial dyeing not only offers a renewable and biodegradable dyeing
solution but also reduces reliance on petrochemicals. Research has demonstrated that bacteria such as
Streptomyces and Pseudomonas can produce vibrant pigments suitable for textile dyeing, with good
color fastness and fabric compatibility [63]. Further studies have focused on optimizing fermentation
conditions to increase dye yield and reduce production time, enhancing the efficiency and costeffectiveness of microbial dyeing [64].

Figure 7. Various melanin synthesis pathways using microbial synthesis techniques[63].

Microbial dyeing offers several advantages over traditional natural dye extraction methods. One
major problem with natural dye extraction is the variability in dye yield and quality due to
differences in raw material sources, which can lead to inconsistencies in color and performance.
Microbial dyeing, on the other hand, can produce consistent dye yields and quality by controlling
fermentation conditions and using genetically stable microorganisms. Additionally, natural dye
extraction often involves complex and labor-intensive processes that require large amounts of water
and chemicals, leading to high production costs and environmental impact. In contrast, microbial
dyeing uses fermentation, a relatively simple and scalable process that can be carried out with
minimal water and chemical use. This method also allows for the production of dyes from renewable
resources, such as agricultural waste and biomass, further reducing its environmental footprint.
In conclusion, innovative technologies such as plasma technology, digital textile printing with
biodegradable inks, and microbial dyeing are at the forefront of eco-friendly dyeing research. These
advancements hold promise for significantly reducing the environmental impact of textile dyeing
processes while maintaining or enhancing dyeing efficiency. Microbial dyeing, in particular, offers
solutions to the main problems of natural dye extraction by providing consistent quality, simpler
processes, and the use of renewable resources. Despite their potential, challenges such as high initial
costs, technical complexities, and scalability issues need to be addressed. Continued research and
development are essential to overcome these barriers and facilitate the broader adoption of these
sustainable dyeing technologies.

5. Conclusions
The textile dyeing industry is undergoing a significant transformation towards sustainability, driven
by the need to reduce its environmental impact. This review has examined various approaches and
innovations in eco-friendly dyeing processes, highlighting both established methods and emerging
technologies.
We explored advancements in natural dye extraction techniques such as enzymatic extraction,
ultrasound-assisted extraction, and the use of eco-friendly solvents. Despite these improvements,
natural dyes face significant industrial challenges, including variability in raw material sources,
complex extraction processes, and higher production costs.
Eco-friendly industrial dyeing techniques using synthetic dyes were also discussed, including low
liquor ratio dyeing, waterless dyeing technologies, closed-loop systems, and advanced oxidation
processes. These methods improve process efficiency and water conservation, reducing the overall
environmental footprint. However, challenges such as high initial costs and technical complexities
remain.
Emerging technologies such as plasma technology, digital textile printing with biodegradable inks,
and microbial dyeing offer promising solutions. Plasma technology enhances dye uptake and fixation
without water or chemicals, digital textile printing with biodegradable inks minimizes environmental
impact, and microbial dyeing provides consistent quality and simpler processes compared to natural
dye extraction.
Despite these advancements, several blind spots and challenges persist in current research. High
initial costs and technical barriers hinder the widespread adoption of these technologies. The
scalability of these methods to meet industrial demands remains a critical challenge. Additionally,
