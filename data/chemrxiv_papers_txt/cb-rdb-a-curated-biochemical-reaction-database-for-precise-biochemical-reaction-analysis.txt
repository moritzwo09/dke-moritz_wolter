Abstract
We present CBR-db, a curated biochemical reaction database that integrates and refines data from
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the ATLAS of Biochemistry
databases to enable chemically consistent analyses of biochemical reaction data. This curation
effort addresses key limitations of both KEGG and ATLAS, such as malformed chemical
representations, inaccurate stoichiometry, and ambiguous or incomplete reaction entries. These
limitations are addressed in CBR-db, enabling more chemically realistic analyses of biochemical
reactions and hypothesized reactions and reaction networks constructed from these, which are
essential for applications in research areas ranging from prebiotic chemistry to metabolism and its
evolution, and synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Altogether, CBR-db features 148,673
high-quality reactions and 18,716 compounds, with details of the refinement and curation
procedures highlighted in this report. CBR-db is designed to be continuously updated,
incorporating the latest releases from the KEGG and ATLAS databases. Furthermore, it provides
a rigorous framework so that the reaction list can be extended, and further issues can be improved.

CBR-db is provided as an open-access resource, enabling researchers to leverage its curated
biochemical reaction data1.
Introduction
Biochemical databases like the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the
ATLAS of Biochemistry offer extensive data that underpins a variety of computational and
experimental workflows within synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, drug design, and
evolutionary biology. Established in 1995, the KEGG database has become essential for research
into biochemical reactions, pathways, and networks2. However, its limitations include the absence
of intermediate reactions, metabolites not linked to reaction pathways, and incomplete enzyme
characterization. To attempt to address this deficit, the ATLAS of Biochemistry database was
developed by applying a large set of reaction rules and prediction algorithms to theoretically
predict the entire possible reactome of enzyme-catalyzed reactions from what is cataloged of
known metabolism in KEGG3. Consequently, ATLAS systematically addresses the gaps left by
KEGG by hypothesizing enzymatically catalyzed reactions that have never been reported to occur
in living organisms yet align with known enzyme activities, thus providing a valuable resource for
investigating new reaction pathways and predicting possible biochemical functionality missing
from current data4.
ATLAS inherited many data quality issues present in KEGG and introduced several new ones,
such as incomplete stoichiometry, missing elements, and inconsistent chemical representations.
This limits effectiveness for downstream applications where precise and high-quality reaction
datasets are necessary. Building upon these foundational efforts, we introduce CBR-db, a Curated
Biochemical Reaction database that integrates KEGG and ATLAS1. Our work addresses these
challenges and enhances compound and reaction data quality through systematic curation, which

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c23c9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6986-5526 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

includes correcting malformed compounds, re-balancing stoichiometric equations, and removing
ambiguous or incomplete entries. With 148,673 high-quality reactions and 18,716 compounds,
CBR-db enables applications that demand high-quality biochemical reaction datasets. These
include metabolic network reconstruction for synthetic biology, flux balance analysis for
bioprocess

optimization,

retrosynthesis,

atom-tracking,

and

prediction

in

cheminformatics, and even prebiotic chemistry modeling to explore the origins of metabolism5–11.
CBR-db thus represents a significant value to the research community as a complement to KEGG
and ATLAS, tailored for applications requiring accurate chemical reaction modeling.
Methods
The latest KEGG (v.113, dated January 1, 2025) release was integrated with ATLAS 2018 data4.
KEGG reaction entries superseded their corresponding ATLAS reaction, provided all quality
control checks (as noted below) were passed. Duplicated entries were removed during the
integration to ensure the inclusion of the most up-to-date and accurate biochemical information.
The curation efforts were structured around two primary components: compounds and reactions
(Figure 1).
Compound Curation
The first stage of the curation process focused on addressing inconsistencies and inaccuracies in
the KEGG compound data (Figure 1).
Standardization of Chemical Representations
All compounds were converted to consistent and reproducible SMILES and InChI formats to
ensure compatibility with cheminformatics tools and computational workflows12,13. Compounds

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c23c9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6986-5526 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

were standardized and sanitized using the RDKit standardization and sanitize functions to resolve
improper stereochemical notations that impacted 3D embedding and chirality calculations14.
Correction of Elemental Entries and Ambiguous Notations
Compounds with malformed elemental entries (e.g., treating OH as an element instead of a
compound) were reprocessed to conform to chemical conventions. Inconsistent representations of
functional groups, including R-group and nitrogen notations, were also standardized to remove
ambiguities.
Removal of Undefined or Incomplete Entries
Compounds lacking essential information, such as structural information or empirical formulas,
were excluded from the curated dataset. This step ensured that only chemically well-defined
compounds were kept for subsequent analyses.
Reaction Curation
The curation of reactions was based on the refined compound dataset and aimed at eliminating
incomplete, ambiguous, and chemically invalid entries from both KEGG and ATLAS (Figure 1).
Treatment of Incomplete and Redundant Reactions
Reactions labeled as “incomplete” or “unclear” in KEGG were systematically targeted for
correction, as a lack of critical reactants or products would otherwise make them unsuitable for
accurate computational analyses. Furthermore, “multi-step” and “overall” reactions defined by
KEGG, which summarize complex processes without offering unique information, were removed.
Filtering of Reactions with Large Macromolecules and Missing Co-Factors

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c23c9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6986-5526 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Entities outside the scope of metabolite-level studies, such as large glycans and proteins, were
excluded. This includes reaction entries that implicitly involve large macromolecules, but
information on their transformations is insufficiently captured in compound entries. We also
removed entries where an implied or missing coenzyme or cofactor has not been fully represented
in the reaction to ensure that only high-confidence reactions are included in the dataset.
Stoichiometric Balancing and Reaction Completion
All reactions were reassessed for stoichiometric consistency. When feasible, missing elements and
common small molecules were incorporated to balance the equations. Left and right-side
imbalances were systematically rectified, ensuring chemically valid transformations (Figure 2).
Handling Halogens
Reactions involving generic halogens were refined by instantiating specific entities. To address
these issues, 27 new reactions were added, enhancing the dataset’s comprehensiveness.
Results and Discussion
The curation and refinement of KEGG and ATLAS reaction data in CBR-db led to significant
improvements across multiple dimensions. It addresses limitations such as malformed compound
representation, incomplete reactions, and imbalanced reaction stoichiometry. The results are
grouped into two broad categories: dataset size and scope and data quality improvements. These
enhancements provide a well-curated dataset that improves upon existing resources while offering
a more curated and reliable dataset tailored for precise biochemical modeling required for those
downstream applications that require accurate reaction chemistry.
Dataset Size and Scope

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c23c9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6986-5526 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

CBR-db integrates data from KEGG and ATLAS, resulting in a meticulously curated biochemical
reaction dataset that prioritizes accuracy and reliability by eliminating spurious and low-quality
reaction entries. After removing duplicate or superseded entries, the integration yielded 18,716
unique compound entries and 148,673 unique reactions. In total, 2517 (~20.62%) KEGG and
13,185 (~8.8%) ATLAS reaction entries either needed significant updates and corrections due to
issues such as malformed mol representations, improper protonation states, and incorrect elemental
notations, or were filtered out from the initial pool for failing to meet our quality control standards.
To address gaps and ambiguities in reactions, new inferred reactions were created by resolving
generic halogen species, thus expanding the inferred reaction space compared to the ATLAS and
KEGG databases. This effort ensures that the data set provides high-quality reactions, facilitating
its application to research questions where precise chemical reaction models are crucial.
Data Quality Improvements
Stoichiometric Balancing, Elemental balancing
A critical focus of this work was ensuring the chemical validity of reactions. Approximately 806
(~6.6%) KEGG and 11,936 (~8%) ATLAS reactions were corrected for stoichiometric imbalances
by injecting missing elements or molecules, such as Fe or H2O, and rebalancing the reactant and
product sides (Figure 2). All compounds were sanitized and standardized using RDKit compounds
to enhance compatibility with cheminformatics tools and thermodynamic modeling. Issues with
malformed compounds, including improper stereochemical notations and inconsistent R-group
definitions, were resolved. The resulting dataset fully standardizes compound annotations,
enhancing its utility for tasks requiring accurate 3D embeddings or chirality calculations.
Removal of Ambiguous and Redundant Reactions

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c23c9 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6986-5526 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Of unbalanced reactions, those tagged as “general,” “unclear,” or “incomplete” in KEGG were
systematically flagged, attempted to be fixed, and excluded if the reaction could not be salvaged.
This step eliminated entries unsuitable for quantitative modeling and ensured the clarity of the
curated data. Similarly, KEGG reactions labeled as “overall” or multi-step and annotated with their
constituent parts are removed. Our choice to omit these reduces redundancy and ensures a more
consistent representation of chemical data, with all data at the same level of granularity, suitable
for computational workflows.
Conclusion
The improvements in CBR-db greatly enhance its utility for specific downstream applications.
Nonetheless, the deliberate large-scale pruning of low-quality data inherently introduces certain
limitations. For example, large glycans and macromolecules (e.g., proteins, peptides, and
nucleotide oligos) are commonly unaccompanied by structural information in KEGG, meaning
that reactions involving them would not be found in CBR-db’s curated database. This currently
limits the applicability of CBR-db for research questions associated to these molecular species.
However, CBR-db is extensible, and we invite the community to contribute structural information
for compounds currently lacking such data. Furthermore, while stoichiometric corrections resolved
many issues, additional experimental validation of specific reactions (where algorithmic balancing
of reactions was implemented or where generic functional groups such as halogens were resolved)
is necessary to confirm their biochemical relevance. This is also true for hypothesized reactions
from the ATLAS database, a majority of which have not yet been experimentally confirmed in
living organisms. Despite these limitations, the improvements implemented in CBR-db
significantly enhance the utility of biochemical compound and reaction data for those downstream
applications where chemically accurate models of reactions are required, such as for large-scale
