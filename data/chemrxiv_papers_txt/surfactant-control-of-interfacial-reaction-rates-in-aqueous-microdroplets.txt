Abstract
Microdroplets are purported to enhance reaction rates and produce spontaneous chemical
transformations that are unfavorable in macroscale systems. The gas-liquid interface is widely implicated
for the emergence of these chemical anomalies. Experiments conducted on individual microdroplets
provide a unique platform for studying interfacial effects while bypassing transport limitations often
encountered in macroscopic systems. We investigate such interfacial effects by analyzing the suppression
of the I- + O3 surface reaction by the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 in an array of levitated
microdroplets. Using a novel kinetic framework
describing surface and bulk reactivity, we find that
increasing surfactant concentration shifts the locus
of reaction from the top-most nanometer of the
interface to a subsurface region located < 2 nm
below the surface. This detailed picture of spatial
reactivity is afforded only by considering the
timescales for O3 adsorption and solvation combined
with reaction monitoring in single microdroplets.
Chemical uniqueness is further illustrated by the I- +
O3 rate dependence on [Triton X-100], which is
quantitatively understood by considering finite size
effects in microdroplets. Both size and surface
effects are considered to derive an analytical
expression for reactive uptake of O3 which demonstrates the role of competitive adsorption of Triton-X
and I- at the gas-liquid interface. This work establishes a novel approach to understanding interfacial
reaction kinetics that successfully links nanometer-scale dynamics from molecular simulations with
macroscale measurements of surface tension and microscale measurements of chemical reactivity.

I. Introduction
Microdroplets present unique chemical environments and are reported to exhibit unexpectedly
rapid reaction kinetics.1–3 These kinetics are generally difficult to interpret in many experiments as reactive
contributions from the gas, bulk liquid, and interface are not easily distinguished, which has been shown
to lead to erroneous conclusions about microdroplet reactivity.4–6 Key kinetic parameters such as reagent
concentrations, droplet radii, and the rates of gas-liquid partitioning and evaporation are also difficult to
constrain in spray-type microdroplet experiments—leading similarly to exaggerated claims of interfacial
reactivity.7,8 Furthermore, there is an ongoing debate around the evidence for and mechanism of
“spontaneous” chemistry that is attributed to strong electric fields.9–14
Reaction rates at the gas-liquid interface do, however, likely deviate from their bulk analogs.
Reagent concentrations at the interface are known to differ from those in the bulk solution for many
molecules due to their unique thermodynamic stability at the interface15–19 or from the kinetics of
competing diffusion and adsorption timescales.20–22 Surfactant molecules exhibit an extreme preference
for the gas-liquid interface due to their chemical structure, the consequences of which are important for
understanding the dynamic surface tension of microdroplets and the activation of cloud condensation
nuclei.23–29 Surface tension measurements on surfactant-containing microdroplets have revealed unique
static properties originating from finite-volume effects in pico-liter volumes.30–32 Additionally, recent
work by Bain et al.33 interrogating the dynamics of surfactant adsorption has shown that timescales for
interfacial equilibration span up to milliseconds for freshy generated microdroplets with radius r ~ 25 μm.
Interfacial reaction rates may also be strongly influenced by dynamics at the interface. For
multiphase reactions, molecular motions on the top-nanometer of solution can significantly alter a reaction
trajectory compared to a purely bulk-dominated process.34,35 Furthermore, the energetics of the reaction
coordinate itself may be influenced by the partially solvated environment of the interface,36,37 although
empirical validation of this effect is limited. Our previous investigations of iodide oxidation kinetics in
microdroplets38,39 indeed suggest that partial-solvation of the I- + O3 reaction at the interface yields a
reaction efficiency resembling the gas-phase,40 rather than the aqueous-phase. Nevertheless, direct probes
of interfacial chemistry are necessary to verify such observations and provide a basis for identifying
general trends needed to link reaction efficiency to the degree of solvation. Given the number of
uncertainties surrounding surface reactivity, there remains a need for novel kinetic methods and detailed
models of chemistry at microdroplet interfaces.41

Here we report on the coupling of a prototypical surface reaction (I- + O3) with interfacial
adsorption of the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 (TX) in microdroplets. Kinetic measurements
demonstrate that the reaction is effectively inhibited by addition of [Triton X-100], with reactivity
switching from the surface to the subsurface. This system is chosen since the ozonation of iodide in
aqueous solution is a relatively well characterized system42–44 that exhibits chemical reactivity at the
interface under acidic conditions.39 Similarly, Triton X-100 is a common surfactant whose interfacial
properties in both bulk aqueous systems and in microdroplets is well characterized.30,45–47 The inhibition
of the surface reaction with increasing [TX] results from the competition of TX with I- at the gas-liquid
interface, which is accompanied by “bulk depletion” of surfactant throughout the microdroplet
volume.30,31
To quantitatively explain the experimental observations, a multiphase reaction model is used to
replicate the microdroplet kinetics using explicit simulations. This multiphase model is also used to derive
analytical expressions for predicting reactive uptake. The coupled chemical and mass-transport framework
used in this model is adapted from previous work on the I- + O3 reaction in droplets for varying reagent
concentrations and pH.38,39 This framework also includes the spatial partitioning of the gas-phase, aqueous
surface, subsurface region, and bulk interior in order to isolate the reactive contributions of each. Fig. 1A
conceptually outlines the workings of the model, where O3 adsorption and desorption at the interface
couple to the surface reaction, solvation, and the subsurface reaction. This conceptual framework is used
to predict the chemical kinetics using stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations (as has been explored
extensively with this particular reaction system)38,39 and to derive an analytical expression for reactive
uptake that includes interfacial effects of Triton X-100. Molecular properties at the interface are
parameterized in the model using average density profiles from molecular dynamics simulations (MD), as
illustrated in Fig. 1B, and by macroscale surface tension measurements of Triton X-100. Consequently,
the reaction location can be identified with high fidelity, as summarized in Fig. 1, where the overall uptake
of O3 is controlled by the surface reaction for low [TX] and by liquid diffusion of O3 into the sub-surface
region at high [TX] (extending < 2 nm beneath the surface).

Fig. 1: (A) Model droplet undergoing oxidation with increasing surfactant concentration. Higher concentrations
of surfactant inhibit the surface reaction and reactivity in the subsurface region dominates. (B) Conceptual
scheme of the droplet interface showing I- density extending into the bulk solution, and O3 density in the gas
phase from Prophet et al.39 Density profiles for these reagents are normalized with respect to their bulk phase
densities, and both show some degree of density enhancement at the interface. Notably, the density profiles
overlap across the ~ 1 nm range where the overall density attenuates, which we identify herein as the surface.
The subsurface region we denote as the “reaction-diffusion” region as this extends the length of the reactiondiffusion length as defined for O3 under the experimental salt concentration, of LRD = 1.36 nm.

II. Experimental
Microdroplet oxidation kinetics are measured in a quadrupole electrodynamic trap (QET)48
equipped with an open-port sampling interface (OPSI) for single droplet mass spectrometry (MS).38 This
particular assembly is recently described in multiple works, along with comparable configurations.38,49,50
The QET charges and traps individual microdroplets generated from a piezo-electric droplet dispenser
(Microfab). Arrays of ~100 microdroplets are trapped while a gas phase oxidant is introduced to the
enclosed assembly, initiating the reaction. Single microdroplets are then sized via Mie scattering51,52
before being ejected from the QET into the OPSI-MS. Droplet signals obtained from OPSI-MS allow for
the quantitative determination of the solute consumed during the reaction. Additional information and a
schematic of the experimental apparatus is provided in supplemental information section SI-1.
The ion signal from iodide (m/z = 126.89) is shown in Fig. 2A, with example mass spectra before
and after the reaction in SI-1. Peak areas, integrated from the time-series, are used to quantify the [I-] in
individual droplets during exposure to O3, as shown in Fig. 2B. Microdroplets are prepared from solutions
that contain NaI and citric acid to buffer the pH at 3. NaCl is added to the solution to maintain constant
water activity and therefore droplet size over the course of reaction. For these experiments, the humidity
of the trap was maintained at 88%, and hence, the final water activity in the microdroplets is aw = 0.88.
Using this final water activity and the radius of the droplet, the initial droplet concentrations are: [NaI]0 =
795 mM, 1 M NaCl, and 1M citric acid/sodium citrate. Triton X-100 is added to the initial droplet solution
in a concentration range of 6 µM to 1.6 mM. Stock solutions containing surfactant were first prepared via
serial dilution, before adding salt solution to obtain the final concentration.

initial, unreacted droplets are first detected, followed by iodide decay resulting from O3 exposure. Panel B shows
peak areas from overall intensity trace in A.

III. Results
Iodide consumption kinetics as a function of [TX] are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3A shows that the
reaction slows when increasing [TX] from 32 μM to1.6 mM. The entire experimental dataset across a
broad range of [TX] (6 μM to 3.2 mM) is shown in Fig. 3B. The O3 concentration for all experiments is
500 ± 10 ppb and initial droplet radii are r = 17 ± 1 μm. As shown in Fig. 3, the overall rate of I- decay
decreases with increasing [TX]. For comparison, explicit kinetic simulations are included for each reaction
condition in Fig. 3. These simulations use a previously validated kinetic model for iodide oxidation in
microdroplets,39 augmented with an additional step to include Triton X-100 adsorption to the air-water
interface. Details of the kinetic model and an overview of the Triton X-100 adsorption description are
included in the following analysis section.

results for a high and low [TX] condition. Panel (B) provides individual kinetics for each condition.

where r is the droplet radius and c̅ the mean speed of O3 in the gas-phase. Uptake coefficients are shown
in Fig. 4 and exhibit a non-linear dependence on [TX]. For [TX] < 100 μM, the reaction kinetics are
largely insensitive to the addition of TX with the observed uptake of 𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝 ~ 5.5×10-3, a value that is
equivalent for the same sized microdroplets in the absence of [TX].39 For 100 μM < [TX] < 500 μM, there
is a sharp transition with the observed uptake decreasing to ~1.5×10-3. Increasing the [TX] beyond 500
μM has no noticeable effect on the uptake coefficient. This behavior is consistent with the simple picture
that increasing TX displaces iodide from the surface, which effectively shuts off the surface reaction for
[TX] ≥ 500 μM. The plateau observed for higher [TX] indicates that once the surface is saturated with
TX, only reactivity within the sub-surface of the microdroplet contributes to the net loss of I-, thus yielding

a smaller uptake coefficient. Although one might predict that this saturation point should coincide with
the CMC of Triton X-100 in bulk solution (~200 μM), this shift in the observed saturation behavior to
larger [TX] (~500 μM) is a consequence of surfactant adsorption in finite-sized droplets, which is
discussed in the following section.

X-100] studied. Analytical expressions Eq. 2-4 are compared to experimental values. Error bars indicated around
model results represent the predicted values for ± 1 μm in radius.

IV. Analysis
The experimental results shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Fig. 4 qualitatively suggest that the
addition of TX inhibits the I- + O3 reaction at the air-water interface. To understand this more
quantitatively, a competitive adsorption model of I- and TX is developed. This model utilizes the same
multiphase kinetic framework used to execute the explicit kinetic simulations in Fig. 3. The kinetic
simulations are performed using Kinetiscope (https://hinsberg.net/kinetiscope/), as discussed extensively
in previous publications.38,39,49 The specific reaction mechanism used here and the spatial representation
of a droplet within Kinetiscope can be found in Prophet et al.39 The mechanism consists of the primary
oxidation of the iodide anion by O3 followed by a series of secondary chemical steps that ultimately

produce I2 at pH 3. Chemically relevant kinetic regions of the microdroplet are identified, including the
surface, sub-surface, and inner bulk, with mass-transport kinetics defined at the interface and between
each adjacent region. The dimensions of the interfacial region is approximated using the density
attenuation across the interface as observed in MD.39 The sub-surface length is defined using the reactiondiffusion length of O3 in solution. The reaction-diffusion length, as previously discussed,54–56 is the
average distance an O3 molecule diffuses in solution prior to undergoing a reaction. Kinetic steps
describing mass transport of the reactants and solutes at the interface are also described, constrained by
MD and previously reported values. Here, kinetic steps are added to model Triton X-100 adsorption to the
interface. Since the kinetic model and simulation methods have been thoroughly described in recent work,
we instead emphasize the introduction of analytical expressions for uptake coefficients at the surface and
within the reaction-diffusion region below. These uptake expressions rely on previous work and are
augmented here with the addition of steps to describe TX adsorption.57
Formulation of Uptake Coefficients
Reactive uptake coefficients 𝛾𝑠 and 𝛾𝑟𝑑 resulting from O3 loss at the droplet surface (s) and within

form in which a reaction term is defined using local concentrations (indicated with subscripts s or rd to
denote the relevant region), normalized by the O3 collisional flux on the droplet surface. Each equation
has a volumetric weighting term to account for the relative fraction of the entire droplet volume that is
kinetically active (i.e., surface or reaction-diffusion region). We note that there is an additional
contribution, 𝛾𝑏 , to the overall uptake arising from the inner bulk (b) or “core” of the droplet, beyond the
depth of the reaction diffusion length Lrd (the core, in fact, comprises the vast majority of the droplet
9

volume). Since Lrd has nanometer dimensions for the current experiments, virtually all of the reactivity
occurs either at the surface or within the reactive diffusive (RD) volume. Therefore, we can neglect the
uptake contribution of 𝛾𝑏 in the following analysis. Fig. 5 provides a geometric overview of the droplet
regions, with length scales and the corresponding 𝛾 for each region.

Fig. 5: Conceptual overview of microdroplet spatial regions (not to scale), with respective defining
lengths and uptake coefficients labeled. As noted above, the uptake contribution from the inner core is
neglected in the present work due to the much larger values of 𝛾𝑠 and 𝛾𝑟𝑑 .
Application of Eqs. 2 and 3 requires calculating [I-(ads)] and [O3(ads)] in the surface region, and [I(rd)] and [O3(rd)] in the RD region. This is done by applying a steady-state assumption to the kinetic

framework used in the stochastic simulations, as described in detail in section SI-3. We assume that shortly
after the reaction has begun, local concentrations of reactants in each geometric region rapidly achieve
steady-state. These steady-state concentrations are governed by the balance of mass transport (source) and
chemical reactivity (sink). The governing transport kinetics rely heavily on both gas- and liquid-phase
diffusion of O3, as well as the desorption and solvation kinetics across the energetic barrier at the interface.
For the solutes I- and TX, diffusional transport is simpler, and the droplet can be assumed to be well-mixed
since the transport rate of I- from the bulk to the surface is larger than the surface-loss rate under our
experimental conditions. This is generally a reasonable approximation when the aqueous reactant
concentration (i.e., iodide) is many orders of magnitude larger than that of the solubilized trace gas. In this

case, the steady-state subsurface concentration in the RD region, [I-(rd)], is simply the initial bulk
concentration [I-b]0.
Assuming the interfacial concentration of I- is not perturbed by the reaction (also generally true
when a trace gas reacts with a concentrated solute), the steady-state surface-adsorbed concentration of
iodide [I-(ads)] can be described by a Langmuir competitive-adsorption isotherm,58

measurements,33,60 although we note there exists substantial deviation in these timescales for different
surfactants, and a unique measurement for Triton X-100 has not been made to the best of our knowledge.
Fortunately, the model results are insensitive to the absolute values of ksolv and kdesolv since the experimental
time-scale is much longer than the equilibration time of the surfactant at the interface, which is expected
to be on the order of milliseconds.33

Surface Adsorption Coupling to Bulk Depletion in Microdroplets
Benchmarked to macroscopic measurements, the partitioning of TX to the interface can be
modeled in microdroplets using the same general mechanism. An important consequence of applying this
description to microscale volumes is that the surface coverage diverges from that expected for macroscale solutions.56 This is because microdroplets lack the total number of TX molecules required to satisfy
the equilibrium surface coverage observed in a macroscale solutions. This is shown in Fig. 7A, where
divergence from the macroscopic behavior becomes quite pronounced in small droplets. This finitevolume effect arises from the depletion of surfactant concentration in the bulk interior as the surfactant
partitions to the droplet interface.61 Considering surface-to-volume constraints for a single droplet radius
and the partitioning kinetics parametrized above for TX, a simple expression for adsorbed concentration56
and the corresponding depleted bulk concentration is (see section SI-3 for derivation),

In Eqs. 8-10c, [TX]0 is the nominal concentration of Triton X-100, equivalent to the bulk concentration in
the absence of finite-volume effects. This nominal concentration [TX]0 is taken as the independent
quantity and is plotted as the domain in Figs. 7A and B. Eq. 8 provides the equilibrium surfactant
concentration at the interface, whereas Eq. 9 provides an expression for the corresponding equilibrium
bulk concentration in the droplet. This demonstrates how the true bulk concentration [TX(bulk)] in the
microdroplet deviates from the nominal bulk concentration [TX]0 as the droplet radius decreases, shown
for an array of sizes and concentrations in Fig. 7B. This equilibrated concentration [TX(bulk)] computed by

Eq. 9 is the relevant bulk concentration to describe competitive adsorption between I- and TX. As such,
the expression for [TX(bulk)] is used in Eq. 5 to accurately model the adsorbed concentration of I- as a
function of both [I-(bulk)] and [TX(bulk)] in the droplet.

Fig. 7: Panel (A) shows the surface-adsorbed concentration (or fractional surface coverage) for [Triton
X-100] ranging from 10-5-10 mM in droplets with various radii. The suppression of coverage fraction
for smaller microdroplets is a finite-volume effect, where adsorption to the interface is coupled to
depletion of the bulk concentration. This is also demonstrated in panel (B), where the equilibrium [TX]
is shown vs the nominal bulk concentration. For both of these panels, the nominal bulk [Triton X-100]0
axis indicates the bulk concentration of the droplet in the absence of any surface adsorption.
Importantly, the true bulk concentration at equilibrium can be greatly depleted relative to the nominal
concentration, as demonstrated in (B).

Expressions for the uptake coefficients given in Eqs. 2 and 3 are now fully constrained by Eqs. 11

and 12. We highlight that the competitive adsorption isotherm defining [I(𝑎𝑑𝑠)
] in Eq. 5 is necessary to

calculate [O3(𝑎𝑑𝑠) ] in Eq. 11 and [O3(𝑟𝑑) ] in Eq. 12. Note that the competitive adsorption description in
Eq. 5 itself relies on the depletion equation for [TX(bulk)] in Eq. 9.
V. Discussion
By implementing the approach outlined above, a quantitative assessment of the observed kinetics
is possible. As shown in Fig. 4, the total uptake calculated by Eq. 4 agrees with the measured uptake
coefficients as [TX] increases from 6 μM to 3.2 mM. Individual uptake contributions from the reaction in
surface region (Eq. 2) and RD region (Eq. 3) demonstrate that the overall reactivity is dominated by the
surface when [TX] < 150 μM, which then becomes increasingly attenuated when [TX] > 150 μM. This
attenuation is accompanied by a slight increase in the reactivity of the RD region. This predicted rise in
the RD contribution results from the fact that when the surface-reaction dominates, O3(ads) becomes
partially depleted at the interface such that the reactivity in the RD region is partially “screened.”
Importantly, the degree of surface-reaction suppression plateaus when [TX] > 500 μM, indicating the
microdroplet surface is saturated by Triton X-100. For this case, the reactivity is dominated by the subsurface RD region, since I- is completely displaced from the surface by TX. The [TX]0 where the surfaceto-subsurface transition occurs as well as the overall shape of the uptake dependence observed in
experiment is reproduced by the analytical expression shown in Eq. 4.
The unique chemical kinetics observed in the experiments arise from two distinct effects related
to the nature of the interface and the microscale volume. The first, and most clear, is the increasing
displacement of I- at the air-water interface with increasing [TX]. The potential for I- displacement by TX
has been modeled using a competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherm parametrized from surface-tension
measurements of aqueous TX and from molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous I-.39 Although a
competitive-adsorption framework is utilized, we note that due to the much greater preference for TX to
the interface than I-, TX greatly out-competes I- for surface area and the surface-reaction uptake
dependence on [TX] scales with the TX coverage function. The second microdroplet-related effect is the
concentration range over which TX inhibits the surface reaction and the shape of the affected uptake. This
range and shape are unique to the depletion of TX within the bulk interior of the microdroplet, which is a

function of the droplet radius and mirrors the surface fractional coverage for microdroplets shown in Fig.
7A.
In comparison to previous works, a similar degree of I- + O3 reaction suppression was reported by
Rouvière et al. in the study of O3 uptake onto deliquesced submicron KI aerosol with varying amounts of
a fatty acid.65 Fatty acids with larger molecular footprints resulted in larger degrees of reaction
suppression, up to over an order of magnitude decrease in overall uptake with increasing surfactant
concentration. However, these submicron experiments are not directly comparable to the current work as
the fatty acids are included at much higher mass fractions than the current work and exceed their solubility
limits. As such, Rouvière et al.65 observe reaction suppression largely due to surface-film formation rather
than monolayer coverage as investigated in the present work. Chemical effects of films and monolayers
also become relevant for understanding the reactivity of iodide in the sea-surface microlayer (SSM), which
contains a complex mixture of inorganic and surface-active organic molecules. Tinel et al.66 analyzed the
volatile product distributions from O3 oxidation of simulated seawater and real SSM samples,
demonstrating that microlayer composition has a marked effect on I2 production rates. Similarly,
Schneider et al.67 measured the production of I2 from the ozone uptake onto aqueous iodide solutions
under varying conditions with proxies to seawater and microlayer conditions. While the impact of
surfactant adsorption to iodide-chemistry in the SSM is likely significant, we note that the behavior
analyzed here applies more directly to concentrated solutions where surface reactions dominate—unlike
the dilute [I-] found in seawater where reactivity is dominated by liquid-diffusion limitations of ozone in
the reaction-diffusion region.68
We emphasize that the inclusion of Triton X-100 into the previously developed chemical kinetic
framework38 involves no adjustable parameters, and the mechanistic addition of TX relies only on surfacetension measurements30 analyzed within a Langmuir framework. Although the Langmuir-adsorption
description is likely an oversimplification (especially for describing gas-liquid dynamics), the additive
behavior of a Langmuir-adsorption description in the current work shows remarkable agreement with
experiment. We believe this is the case because TX adsorption to the interface is much more favorable
than I-, while we expect this simplistic model to potentially break down for two (or more) strongly
adsorbing reagents, especially in a highly concentrated regime.

Chemical reactivity at interfaces is increasingly invoked to explain broad changes in observed
chemical kinetics in environments where surfaces are prominent. Aerosol and microdroplet chemistry,
unsurprisingly, is at the forefront of such exploration since these systems often show distinct signatures
that indicate the presence of surface reactions and provide a convenient reaction platform for investigating
interfacial effects. Here, we present a prototypical example of coupled interfacial phenomena directly
inhibiting the I- + O3 surface reaction in levitated microdroplets. The surfactant Triton X-100 is observed
to suppress the surface reaction when the surface coverage fraction is high enough to displace I- from the
air water interface. The TX concentration dependence of O3 reactive uptake reflects the coverage function
of TX—demonstrating a microdroplet-specific signature due to the bulk-depletion effect of TX adsorption
to the air-water interface. An analytical expression for reactive uptake on the aqueous surface and within
the sub-surface region is derived and based on a previously developed framework. This work demonstrates
how insights into molecular timescales of mass transfer across interfaces, combined with macroscopic
surface tension measurements, inform on chemical reactivity in micron-scale compartments containing a
mixture of organic and inorganic components.
