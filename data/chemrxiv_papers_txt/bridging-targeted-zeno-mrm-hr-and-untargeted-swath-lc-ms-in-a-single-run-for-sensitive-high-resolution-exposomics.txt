ABSTRACT: Traditionally, chemical exposure has been assessed by low-resolution mass spectrometry via targeted approaches due to the typically extremely low concentration of such compounds in biological samples. Nevertheless, untargeted approaches are now becoming a promising tool for a broader investigation of the exposome,
covering additional compounds, their biotransformation products and possible metabolic alterations (metabolomics). However, despite broad compound coverage, untargeted metabolomics still underperforms in ultra-trace
biomonitoring analysis. To overcome these analytical limitations, we present the development of the first combined targeted/untargeted LC-MS method, merging MRM-HR and SWATH experiments in one analytical run, making use of the Zeno technology for improved sensitivity. MRM transitions were optimized for 135 highly diverse
toxicants including mycotoxins, plasticizers, PFAS, personal care products ingredients and industrial side products
as well as potentially beneficial xenobiotics such as phytohormones. As a proof of concept, standard reference
materials of human plasma (SRM 1950) and serum (SRM 1958) were analyzed with both, Zeno MRM-HR + SWATH
and SWATH-only methodologies. Results demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity represented by the detection of lower concentration levels in spiked SRM materials (mean value: 2.2 times and 3 times lower concentrations for SRMs 1950 and 1958, respectively). Overall, detection frequency was increased by 68% (19 to 32
positive detections) in MRM-HR+SWATH mode compared to the SWATH-only. This work presents a promising
avenue for addressing the outstanding challenge in the small-molecule omics field: finding balance between high
sensitivity and broad chemical coverage. It was demonstrated for exposomic applications but might be transferred
to lipidomics and metabolomics workflows.

ities of identification specially for features with lower intensity that would not be selected by DDA experiments.
As a downside, deconvolution algorithms are not 100%
accurate and MS2 spectra become either more polluted
(with miss assigned fragments) or less informative (with
missing fragments assigned to a different precursor),
which ultimately leads to worsened spectra matching.
SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical
fragments) is one type of DIA acquisition mode in which
sequential ranges of precursor isolation windows are selected and fragmented, allowing for the acquisition of
MS2 data for virtually all ions detected at MS1 level.7,8
Fiehn and Cajka (2016)9 reviewed targeted and untargeted metabolomics data in order to evaluate the possibility of having one method with good performance for
both using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
As future directions, the authors highlight the efforts
needed towards the combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches via untargeted MS1
data acquisition and high-resolution MRM transitions for
targeting multiple metabolites. More recently, Bird et al
(2023)10 have introduced a new workflow based on orbitrap and/or TOF systems (SQUAD, Simultaneous Quantitation and Discovery Analysis) aiming at combining
both targeted and untargeted with the main objective of
finding the equilibrium between untargeted and targeted approaches in a single experiment.
This paper describes, to the best of our knowledge, the
first targeted/untargeted, single-injection LC-MS
method for integrated exposomics and metabolomics,
combining the advantages of both approaches, i.e., high
sensitivity (targeted) and broad coverage and retrospective data analysis (untargeted). The use of the recently
introduced Zeno technology, a linear ion trap stage prior
to the TOF analyzer that allows for increased duty cycles
of up to 90%11, resulting in significant increases in sensitivity. In addition to presenting the results obtained for
different xenobiotics in targeted mode (135 compounds)
as well as the results for the analysis of standard references materials (SRM 1950 and SRM 1958), we also describe the method development process that is expected
to support other researchers working in the field of small
molecule omics.

Introduction
Humans are exposed to a myriad of chemicals throughout their lifespan, including industrial pollutants, food
nutrients and contaminants, synthetic products in cosmetics among many others. With that, an increasing interest in the measurement of known and novel chemicals
as well as their possible effect in human health is now
taking place specially under the recently coined idea of
exposomics. First conceptualized by Wild1, the exposome has been defined by Miller and Jones2 as “the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated
biological responses throughout the lifespan, including exposures from the environment, diet, behavior, and endogenous processes”.
When designing any small molecules “omics” such as
exposomics or metabolomics, one of the first decisions is
typically the choice between targeted and untargeted approaches. The first normally relies on the use of low-resolution instruments (such as quadrupoles or ion traps)
and aims at providing quantitative data with increased
sensitivity when compared to high-resolution instruments, usually relying on time-of-flight or orbitrap analyzers. These methods normally include tens to hundreds of compounds and are commonly used for confirming previous hypotheses. In exposomics, for example, these methods are used for large biomonitoring
studies due to their capability to provide quantitative information for trace-level chemicals3, ultimately providing policy markers with information for the science-topolicy interface regarding chemical exposure4. Untargeted approaches, on the other hand, have the advantage
of detecting, in principle, any compound at a given concentration that is able to be ionized and detected. For
that reason, untargeted methodologies have gained momentum in the last years specially under the strategies
termed suspect screening analysis (SSA) and non-targeted analysis (NTA), which enables for the screening of
hundreds to thousands of (potentially novel and relevant) chemicals4. In addition, untargeted data acquisition approaches can be used for the assessment of the
“effects” part of the exposure, i.e., the possible impact on
the levels of endogenous metabolites due to a particular
exposure pattern via metabolomics strategies.5
When acquiring such type of data using an LC-MS or LCHRMS set ups, different acquisition modes can be selected. For targeted analysis, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is the common choice, and it is based on the
detection of usually two transitions (precursor/product
ion pairs) for each analyte, allowing for high sensitivity
and specificity. For untargeted data, on the other hand,
data dependent acquisition (DDA) and data independent
acquisition (DIA) are the most commonly used approaches. The first relies on the selection of the n most
intense m/z detected at MS1 level to further selection
and fragmentation (MS2 acquisition), normally leading to
good quality MS2 spectra of a few of the detected features.6 DIA, on the other hand, has the capability to fragment virtually all detected signals, later performing
spectra deconvolution in order to assign each fragment
to the most likely precursor. As a result, the number of
MS2 spectra acquired is higher, leading to better possibil-

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Sample preparation
Multi-component standard solutions containing 135
compounds (Table S2) were prepared at six different concentrations levels. The selection of compounds was intended to represent a highly diverse and commonly observed chemical exposure panel, considering factors such
as chemical classes, origin of exposure, exposure route,
among others. In addition, the selection of compounds
was based on a previous work published by our group for
a multi-class targeted methodology12. Concentrations
were compound-dependent and are described in details in
Table S2.
Standard reference materials (SRM 1950 and 1958
from NIST) were purchased from NIST and stored at 80°C. In total, 9 replicates of each SRMs were prepared following the protocol previously described by Jamnik et al

(2022)12. For extraction, 30 µL of both SRM were mixed
with 120 µL of extraction solution (ACN/MeOH 50:50,
v/v) in Eppendorf tubes and sonicated for 10min on ice.
The extraction solution contained labeled IS (Table S3)
for accounting for the total variation (sample preparation
+ analytical). A 2 h protein precipitation step was performed at -20°C afterwards, followed by centrifugation for
10 min at 18,000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant (120 µL) was
transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and dried under vacuum at 4°C overnight. From the nine replicates, three were
reconstituted using 120 µL of ACN/H2O 10:90, v/v). The
additional 6 replicates were used to build a matrixmatched calibration curve with the same solvent composition and spiked at the same levels as the standard solutions in solvent. Samples were vortexed for 10min after
reconstitution and centrifuged at 18,000g and 4°C. Finally,
100 µL of the supernatant was transferred to an amber
glass vial for data acquisition. Sample preparation protocol was chosen to maximize chemical coverage13.

1958 and SRM 1950). For positive mode, on the other
hand, MS1 accumulation time was kept the same as for
MRM-HR + SWATH method (0.05 s) and, instead, accumulation times for SWATH-only windows were increased such as total cycle time would compare to maximum cycle time for MRM-HR + SWATH, as previously explained. For instance, maximum scan time for Zeno
MRM-HR +SWATH method was 0.435 s while SWATHonly total cycle time was 0.25 s (0.05 s for MS1 and 0.02
s for each of the 10 SWATH window). Therefore, at the
maximum number of overlapping MRM windows, the total cycle time would be 0.685 s. Based on that, the
SWATH-only method for positive mode was set as total
scan time of 0.643 by keeping MS1 acquisition at 0.05 s
and increasing SWATH windows accumulation time
from 0.02 to 0.05 s. For direct comparison, key method
parameters are also summarized in Table 1.
Table 1. Parameters employed across the different MS methods.
For SWATH-only, cycle time represents the total scan time (constant across the whole chromatographic run). For MRMHR+SWATH, cycle time represents the maximum scan time, since
cycle time changes along the chromatographic run due to its dependency on the number of overlapping MRM transitions.

LC-HRMS instrumentation and parameters
A LC Infinity II 1290 (Agilent) coupled to a Zeno TOF
7600 with a Turbo V source (SCIEX) was used. Chromatographic separation was based on the same method described by Jamnik12 et al (2022). In summary, a 20 min
reversed-phase gradient was employed on an HSS T3
column (Waters), with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and an
injection volume of five microliters.
LC-MS data acquisition was performed for both a
SWATH-only method and the newly developed Zeno
MRM-HR + SWATH methods. Ion source parameters
were standardized across both methodologies, as follow:
GS1 – 50 psi; GS2 – 50 psi; curtain gas – 35 psi; CAD gas
– 9; temperature – 550 °C. In both cases, MS1 data was
acquired from m/z 100 to 1000, with declustering potential at 80V (-80 V for negative mode) and collision energy
at 10V (-10 V for negative mode). Spray voltage was set
at 5500 V for positive ionization mode (ESI+) and -4500
V for negative ionization mode (ESI-).
For the developed Zeno MRM-HR + SWATH data, accumulation time was set at 0.05 s for individuals MRM transitions and at 0.02 s for each SWATH window (n= 10).
SWATH windows were optimized individually for each
SRM using the SWATH windows optimizer provided by
SCIEX. Both SWATH-only and MRM-HR+SWATH methods had the exact same parameter for SWATH acquisition, including windows range, declustering potential
(80 or -80V) and CE, as described in details in Table S4.
For MRM experiment, Start/Stop option was selected,
with TOF Start Mass at m/z 50 and TOF Stop Mass set as
compound-dependent by adding 2 m/z units to precursor m/z. Retention time windows, declustering potentials and collision energies were adjusted for each compound (see Results section) and Zeno Pulsing was activated at a threshold of 8000 cps.
To allow for a point of comparison, the cycle time for the
SWATH-only method was adjusted to a similar value as
the maximum scan time for the MRM-HR + SWATH
method. To evaluate possible differences in increased accumulation time for MS1 or SWATH windows, two different approaches were taken. For the Zeno MRMHR+SWATH in negative mode, accumulation time for
MS1 was increased from 0.05 s to 0.15 s (for both SRM

Finally, the data acquisition sequence was set such as
data for MRM-HR + SWATH and SWATH-only methods
would be acquired sequentially for the same sample.
That approach was taken in order to minimize batch effects when comparing the results for the same sample
between the two different methodologies.

Compound optimization
Two key parameters namely collision energy (CE) and declustering potential (DP, a voltage applied to the orifice to
minimize solvent clusters and help on desolvation of ions)
were optimized by either direct infusion (DP) or using a
LC-MS method (CE). For DP, sub-mixes of all compounds
at either 10 or 100 ng/mL (depending on ionization efficiency) of all standards were constantly injected in the
source using a syringe pump set at 5µL/min. Automatic
DP optimization was performed in SCIEX OS in the range

from 10 to 300 V. For CE optimization, MS2 spectra was
first acquired using DDA with inclusion list for each of the
sub-mixes at in the range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. MS2 spectra were acquired using the collision energy spread (CES)
at 35±15 V. This allows for a combined (and representative) spectra of 3 collision energies: 20, 35 and 50 V. Next,
the 5 most intense fragments (or fragments known to
work best in our targeted approach using low-resolution
instruments12) were selected for further optimization. Finally, an MRM-HR method was created with all selected
transitions, and sub-mixes were injected multiple times
using the above described LC-MS method with one specific
CE for each injection, in the range from 15 to 60 V, with
steps of 5 V (total of 9 injections per submix). Peak areas
were used to select the best fragment and CE (Table S1)

Negative Mode (MoNA - 47,058 spectra) and ESI(-)-MS/MS
from authentic standards (MS-DIAL - 44,669 spectra) were
employed. A spectral match score of 70% was used as a
threshold, with no limitation for minimum dot and reverse
dot-products scores (since data was manually curated afterwards). All method parameters from MS-Dial (from
peak detection to identification) are described in Table
S6.

Results and Discussion
Balancing accumulation time, RT window and total cycle time
Considering the significant number of compounds included in each method, i.e., 83 in ESI- mode and 52 in
ESI+, it is essential to optimize the total cycle time
needed to acquire 1xMS1 + 10xSWATH windows + 1xMS1
+ 83xMRM transitions. This is related to the fact that, as
a rule of thumb, a chromatographic peak should have at
least between six and ten data points15 in order to
achieve satisfactory gaussian shape and reproducibility.
Consequently, the above-mentioned acquisition cycle
has to be repeated at least six times along the width of
every chromatographic peak for proper quantification.
Therefore, accumulation time for each of the mentioned
experiments must be fine-tuned. The parameters found
to be the most important are the accumulation time and
the retention time window of each MRM transition, both
due to the high number of overlapping MRM transitions.
To optimize RT windows, MS1 level data was acquired for
the mixture of analytical standards at the highest concentration level. From this data, we retrieved the peak
width for each compound, and opted for a RT window
that would be defined by ± 0.75 * peak width. For example, methylparaben (RT = 5.55 min) was detected with a
baseline peak width of ~6.6 s, and, therefore, RT window
was set at ±5 s. Manual fine-adjustment was also performed after, especially for compounds which are prone
to suffer from relatively larger RT shifts (such as
phthalates and glucuronide conjugates). Final RT windows are described for each compound in Table S2. Figure 1 presents the final and optimized methods with extracted ion chromatograms, RT and RT windows for each
compound of the target panel.

Data analysis and quality check
Targeted data analysis (MRM-HR) was performed using
SCIEX OS version 3.0.0.3339. Regardless of the MS mode
of acquisition, extracted ion chromatograms for SWATHonly (MS1 level) and MRM+SWATH (MS2 level) were extracted using the default window of 0.02 Da as recommended by SCIEX. Chromatograms were integrated by the
AutoPeak method and smoothed using noise filter algorithm with the Low option. Concentrations were calculated for all compounds detected in non-spiked SRMs by
the use of standard addition method.
For quality control, peak areas of the internal standards in
ESI- mode were inspected in MS1 mode for both SWATHonly and MRM-HR+SWATH. From the labeled IS employed, none was found to be ionized in ESI+ so, relative
standard deviation values (RSD) were only estimated to
be similar to ESI-. Peak areas for MRM+SWATH mode have
presented higher RSD (Table S5), which may be explained by the lower values for peak areas. These may additionally be related to the fact that accumulation time at
MS1 for SWATH-only in ESI- mode was set three times
higher than MRM-HR + SWATH, therefore providing better sensitivity. Nevertheless, it is also important to highlight that this variation is likely to be considerably smaller
for the MS2 data in MRM-HR + SWATH due to the increased
peak areas provided by the Zeno Pulsing technique, which
is, in fact, the data presented and evaluated along this
work. In addition, labeled IS were added to the extraction
solution and, therefore, account for the sum of the variances of both extraction process and analytical run. For
PFOS for example, recovery at very low concentration was
reported12 as 56 ± 25%, representing 50% of variance
only related to sample preparation. As the average RSD
was significantly below this value, we may infer that analytical variance was minimal. Total variance for recovery
was also reported12 for genistein and estradiol at 30% and
14%, respectively, while RSD in our analysis were at 24%
and 23% for MRM-HR+SWATH data.
Finally, MS2 matching for both exogenous (xenobiotics)
and endogenous (metabolites) compounds was performed in MS-DIAL14 (version 5.2.240218.2) against Mass
Bank of North America (MoNA) and MS-DIAL spectral libraries. For ESI+, LC-MS/MS Positive Mode (MoNA - 99,260
spectra) and ESI(+)-MS/MS from authentic standards (MSDIAL, 324,191 spectra) were used. For ESI-, LC-MS/MS

Benchmarking with SRM
Evaluation of detection levels (sensitivity)
One of the main parameters that allows for a sensitivity
comparison between two methods is signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Nevertheless, comparing S/N between different levels of MS data, i.e., MS1 for SWATH-only and MS2
for MRM-HR+SWATH would not provide a meaningful

Figure 1. Overview of extracted ion chromatograms, retention times and detection windows in both ESI- and ESI+ mode. A total of 135
compounds from a variety of chemical classes were included in the MRM-HR experiments, with 83 compounds in ESI- mode and 52 in ESI+
mode. In addition to the targeted quantification of the toxicant panel, the acquisition of SWATH data allows for the untargeted screening of
additional xenobiotics, their biotransformation products as well as endogenous metabolites (no peaks depicted).

comparison. One of the main reasons for this is the expected increase in specificity when dealing with MS2
data, resulting, frequently in a flat (non-existent) baseline which, consequently, makes noise estimation impractical. In addition, S/N estimation algorithms included into SCIEX OS (namely Standard Deviation and
Peak to Peak) require a noise region to be defined. Nevertheless, due to the use of very narrow RT windows for
MRM experiments, selecting this noise region becomes
unrealistic and, as a consequence, estimated S/N values
turn out to be not representative. For these reasons, we
have opted to report, for each analyte, the lowest concentration level that could be detected in the spiked matrix
(and not detected in the non-spiked matrix) as a sensitivity comparison basis. Two criteria were considered to
define if a peak was detected or not: a minimum intensity
threshold of 100 counts and the visual inspection of the

baseline (when possible) to estimate S/N. For a few borderline cases, we opted for a more conservative approach to avoid overestimation of the method’s performance. This approach was taken for all compounds that
were not detected in non-spiked matrix (for compounds
detected in non-spiked matrix, see next section). For
SWATH-only data, MS1 level is reported since compounds could be detected at lower levels when compared to MS2 level (which may be explained for the nonspecific CE chosen for each compound). For MRM-HR
+SWATH data, on the other hand, MS2 level data showed
larger values for peak areas when compared to MS1 data,
as also expected due to the optimized CE and the use of
the Zeno. In summary, mean detected concentrations in
MRM-HR+SWATH were 2.1 and 2.3 times lower for SRM
1950 in ESI- and ESI+ mode, respectively. For SRM 1958,
a four times higher mean detected concentration was
found for ESI-, while ESI+ presented a two-fold increase.

Detection and quantification of xenobiotics
Different xenobiotics were detected in both SRM 1958
and SRM 1950 and are summarized in Table 2. Concentrations were calculated based on the calibration curves
built for MRM-HR + SWATH and SWATH-only methods
(Tables S8 and S9). Concentration values were not significantly different in almost all cases when considering
raw p-values from a paired t-test (performed in Metaboanalyst using the individual concentrations for each replicate). Exception compounds were mono-benzyl
phthalate and trans-3-hydroxy-cotinine for SRM 1958
and nonylphenol and PFOS for SRM 1950. Acetaminophen was found to be different between methods for
both SRM 1950 and SRM 1958. The results showcase the
higher capability for compound detection. From the total
of 17 compounds detected in SRM 1958, roughly 41% (7)
were detected in MRM-HR+SWATH mode only, covering
different classes (bisphenols, PFAS, phthalates, and
herbicides/pesticides such as metribuzin). Similarly,
44% of the compounds detected in SRM 1950 (7 out of
16) were found only with the use of the combined
method.

MRM-HR+SWATH and SWATH-only using MS-DIAL (two
sets of triplicate non-spiked samples see Material and
Methods, Data analysis and quality control section for detailed information). As an initial assessment, the number
of features obtained using the same processing method
was evaluated. As observed in Table 3, MRM-HR+SWATH
data retrieved a larger number of features for all experiments. When comparing the total number of MS2 matching
retrieved from the libraries, SWATH-only data initially
seemed to outperform the newly developed MRMHR+SWATH method.

HR+SWATH data in the quality of a few spectral matches,
more prominently for low abundance compounds (peak
height <1000 counts). Figure 3 presents two illustrative
cases of spectral matches. The first (phenylalanine, Figure

both SWATH-only and MRM-HR+SWATH, outlining the
high MS2 spectral similarity between both methods. Figure 3b, on the other hand, intends to exemplify a case for
which, despite the good matching score for both methods,
spectra similarity is lower across both methods, with
missing fragments for the deconvoluted MS2 spectrum
from MRM-HR+SWATH. This may be explained by the
lower accumulation time for both MS1 and MS2 data, possibly hindering the deconvolution process (i.e., matching
fragments with precursor ions). The same trend can be observed, for instance, for citric acid (Figure S1) and tyrosine (Figure S5) as highly similar spectral matches between both methods (with peak heights all above 1500) as

After manual curation of the data and removal of false positives, it was observed that annotation of compounds was,
in fact, of high similarity between both methods. More specifically, all compounds that could be reasonably annotated (minimum of 2 matching ions and mass error below
5 ppm for parent compound) in SWATH-only mode had
the same suggested compound in MRM-HR+SWATH, with
highly comparable matching scores (dot product, reverse
dot product and total score14). Mirror plots of annotated
compounds for SRM 1950 in both ESI+ and ESI- including
matching scores is described in details in Tables S10 and
S11, along with all mirror plots for both methodologies
(Figures S1-S45). Since a large overlap was observed for
the compounds annotated between SRM 1958 and SRM
1950 in both ionization modes, we opted to not include
mirror plots for the first as a way to avoid repetitive description of the data. Despite the clear similarity in MS2
matching performance, it is important to highlight that
SWATH-only method indeed outperformed MRM-

Supporting Information
Supplementary information provided in Excel (Supplementary tables S1 to S9) and in PDF Document (Supplementary
tables S10 and S11, Figures S1 to S45) are included and provide with additional information regarding the method and
the results

Limitations
Despite the clear method capability towards a more sensitive and comprehensive analysis combining metabolomics and exposomics as well as targeted and untargeted in
a single run, the method is not out of its limitations. Depending on the number of compounds, optimizing chromatographic separation, collision energy and declustering
potential and total cycle time is time-intensive, especially
for a relatively large number of compounds as described
herein. We also acknowledge the lack of labeled internal
standards for absolute quantification. Despite adding such
compounds would lead to a more accurate calculation of
the concentrations, it should be considered that additional
MRM transitions would be required, further elongating total cycle time. Regarding the untargeted data, there is still
the need to evaluate the influence (if any) of different
SWATH accumulation times in terms of signal intensity,
quality of deconvoluted spectra and, ultimately, in the total number of annotated compounds. Moreover, total accumulation times (and consequently, cycle times) may
still be fine-tuned. One example is the MRM accumulation
time, which can be set as compound-dependent rather
than as a unique value for all, depending on overlapping
transitions and total cycle time.

Conclusion and Future Perspectives
A combination of targeted and untargeted approaches for
a single-injection LC-HRMS exposomics/metabolomics is
described. The method is the first of its kind to make use
of the Zeno trap in MRM-HR mode, recently developed
with the aim to correct for duty cycle issues related to TOF
instruments, allowing for increased sensitivity. The results highlight the method's capabilities and its potential
to detect xenobiotics present at low concentrations that
otherwise would not be detected (or would be poorly detected) using a SWATH-only methodology. The method
also allows for future customized developments, not only
in terms of which compounds to include in the targeted
list, but also regarding the choice of a semi or absolute
quantitation. In the field of metabolomics, for instance,
this approach could be employed to detect poorly ionized
and/or low concentration compounds, e.g., endogenous
hormones. Additionally, in applications in which a limited
amount of sample is available (such as for serum samples
for premature infants) or sample amount is limited by the
sample collection technique (such as dried blood spots or
volumetric microsampling devices) may also benefit, producing targeted and untargeted data acquisition in a single
injection. In conclusion, we demonstrated that this type of
data acquisition shows great potential for future application in any field of small molecules “omics” and can be an
interesting alternative for the long-time discussed compromise between sensitivity and coverage.
