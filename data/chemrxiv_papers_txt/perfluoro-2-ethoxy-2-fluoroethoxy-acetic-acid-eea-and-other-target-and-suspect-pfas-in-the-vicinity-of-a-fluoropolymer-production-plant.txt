Abstract
Multiple target and suspect per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including the
replacement fluoropolymer processing aid perfluoro(2-ethoxy-2-fluoroethoxy)-acetic acid
(“EEA”), were measured in both air and surface water in the vicinity of a fluoropolymer
production plant (FPP) in Thornton-Cleveleys (United Kingdom) during sampling campaigns in
2021 and 2023, respectively. Targeted and suspect screening methods were conducted using
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with Q-Exactive HF Orbitrap
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Summed PFAS levels in water nearby the plant
ranged from 30 ng/L to 22.5 μg/L and were dominated by perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids
(PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), most notably perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA; up to 20.6 μg/L), EEA (up to 1.7 μg/L) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA; up to
650 ng/L). Additionally, various homologous series of PFAS suspects, such as hydrogensubstituted PFCAs (H-PFCAs), chlorine-substituted PFCAs (Cl-PFCAs) and monoether
perfluoroether alkyl carboxylic acids (ME-PFECAs) were identified, some for the first time in
Europe. In air, PFOA was detected in all but one sample collected 20 km from the plant at
concentrations ranging from 0.51 to 2.50 pg/m3. The three air samples that showed detectable
EEA concentrations also displayed evidence of long-chained targets and suspects and were
associated with high wind speeds from a southwesterly direction. Overall, this study shows
that this site continues to be a source of a complex mixture of legacy and scarcely monitored

Fluoropolymers are a subset of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) consisting of a
carbon-fluorine backbone that are produced through the polymerization of low molecular
weight
fluorinated
organic
monomers.
Well-known
fluoropolymers
include
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and fluoroelastomers (FKMs).
1,2
Owing to the presence of multiple carbon-fluorine bonds, these specialty materials have
various useful and unique properties, such as high thermal and chemical resistance and low
surface energy. 3 As a result, fluoropolymers are widely used in many different industrial and
consumer applications where these properties are desired. 4 Fluoropolymers are the secondlargest subgroup of PFAS globally with several hundreds of thousands of tons produced
annually and second only to fluorinated gases. 5

A wide variety of PFAS and other fluorinated organic substances are used and/or formed
during the production of fluoropolymers. 6 Fluorosurfactants, which consist of a hydrophobic
per- or polyfluoroalkyl chain and a hydrophilic head group (e.g. carboxylate or sulfonate) are
among the most well-known substances associated with FP production. 7 Fluorosurfactant
salts (e.g. with ammonium, sodium or potassium counter ions), are used as processing aids
that serve to stabilize and disperse aqueous emulsions of monomers in the emulsion
polymerization process. Additionally, fluorosurfactants can be formed as by-products during
fluoropolymer production. 8, 9

While PFAS fluorosurfactants play an important role in the emulsion polymerization process,
other processes that are employed in fluoropolymer production such as suspension
polymerization, the synthesis of fluoromonomers through pyrolysis and further processing
steps such as polymer crosslinking and molecular weight adjustment also involve the use or
formation of PFAS or fluorinated organic substances. Examples of these substances include
fluorinated monomers, pyrolysis by-products, fluorinated solvents, oligomers, chain transfer
agents and crosslinking agents. 6

When considering PFAS emissions, unchecked releases of the long-chain perfluoroalkyl
carboxylic acid (PFCA) fluorosurfactant processing aids perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) by the fluoropolymer production industry from the 1950s until
the early 2010s has contributed significantly to global levels of these substances. 7 Following
concerns about their persistence, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity, these long-chain
fluorosurfactants were voluntarily phased out in Europe, Japan and the USA between 2002
and 2012. Various replacement substances have since emerged. Many of these replacement
fluorosurfactants are proprietary ammonium salts of perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids
(PFECAs) and used in company-specific processes. 10 Examples include Chemours’
hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, “Gen-X”), 3M Dyneon’s ammonium 4,8dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate (“ADONA”), the cyclic perfluorinated C6 quad-ether “C6O4”used by Solvay/Syensqo and perfluoro(2-ethoxy-2-fluoroethoxy)-acetic acid (“EEA”) used by
Asahi Glass Co. (AGC). 10, 11 In addition to the introduction of alternative substances, industry

has also been pressured by authorities to introduce various emission abatement measures to
limit emissions of fluorosurfactants and other PFAS. 12 Although most replacement
fluorosurfactants have a higher solubility and thus a lower bioaccumulation potential compared
to PFOA and PFNA, their continued release, persistence, toxicity and classification as PFAS
warrants further research. 13 Additionally, relatively little is known about the emissions by the
fluoropolymer production industry of PFAS that are not used as fluorosurfactant processing
aids.

83

The aim of the current study was to investigate the emissions and occurrence of the
replacement fluorosurfactant processing aid EEA and other PFAS in air and water collected in
the vicinity of a fluoropolymer production plant (FPP) in Thornton-Cleveleys, UK (Figure 1). To
the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify EEA in any matrix.

2.1 Study site
The AGC Chemicals fluoropolymer production plant (FPP) produces both PTFE and
(poly)ethylene- tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), with production volumes of 4000 and 2000 tonnes
per year respectively. 14 For the production of PTFE, the plant uses emulsion polymerization,
while ETFE is produced in granular form using suspension polymerization. From 1955 until
2012 ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) was used as a processing aid for PTFE
production. 15 The UK Environmental Agency (UK EA) estimated that around 145 tonnes of this
substance were released to the local environment (75 tonnes to the River Wyre and 70 tonnes
to the atmosphere) during this time. Additionally, <5 tonnes of PFOA were landfilled. 15 From
2012 onwards, APFO was replaced by EEA-NH4 (CAS 908020-52-0), the ammonium salt of a
linear six-carbon PFECA with two ether linkages, one between the second and third carbon
and one between the fourth and fifth carbon (Figure 2.). Synonyms for this substance include
SAA-1000, PFO2OA and ‘Asahi’s product’. 10, 13, 14, 16 According to the UK EA, around 800
kilograms of the ammonium salt of EEA (EEA-NH4) is discharged into the River Wyre on a
yearly basis. 13 Additionally, <100 kg of the substance is emitted to the atmosphere. 13 In
addition to the fluoropolymers produced through polymerization, the monomer
tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) is also produced on-site through the pyrolysis of
chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). 14

106

Emissions of HCFC-22, fluoroform (HFC-23), trifluoroethylene (TrFE), TFE,
hexafluoropropylene (HFP), perfluoroisobutylene (PFIB) and difluoromethane (HFC-32) are
permitted to the air. 6 14 Additionally, emissions of 1H-perfluorohexane (1H-PFHx),
perfluorobutyl ethylene (PFBE) and perfluoropropyl vinyl ether (PPVE) are reported for which
no permitting requirements are posed. 6, 17, 18, 19

The plant has three discharge points to surface water that all ultimately lead to the River Wyre
estuary (Figure 1). The main discharge point ‘W1’ is a direct discharge to the River Wyre that,
according to the emission permit, receives all process water effluent that has been treated by
an on-site effluent treatment plant. The second discharge point ‘W2’ releases water to the
Hillylaid Pool, a small tributary to the River Wyre. According to the emission permit, only
uncontaminated surface water and roof water from the installation is discharged here. The third
discharge point, ‘W3’, is a storm runoff discharge that only discharges overflow from the west
effluent pit under very high rainfall conditions to a local stream called Royles Brook. 14

Atmospheric emissions of various PFAS and fluorinated organic substances were reduced
through the installation of a thermal oxidizer facility in 2017, which treats both flue gases and
liquid waste. In 2007, prior to the installation of this thermal oxidizer, PFOA levels of up to of

this study (section 2.2.1). 20

2.2 Standards and reagents
Standards for a total of 50 native PFAS (including EEA) as well as multiple isotope-labeled
internal standards (ISs) were obtained Wellington Labs (Guelph, ON, CA) and Apollo Scientific
(Bredbury, UK). A full list is provided in Table S1 of the Supporting Information (SI)).

2.3 Sampling & extraction
2.3.1 Air samples
Air samples were collected between 11 June and 24 September 2021 using a Tisch TE-1000
(Tisch Environmental, Cleves, OH, US) high volume air sampler located at the Hazelrigg
Meteorological Station at Lancaster University on 110 mm quartz fiber filters (QFFs). This
sampling site is located about 20 kilometers northeast (downwind) of the AGC Chemicals site
in Thornton-Cleveleys (Figure 1) and was chosen because a) PFAS measurements could be
compared to a previous study 20 from the same site; b) meteorological data (e.g. wind speed
and direction) are collected that could be analyzed as meteorological drivers of PFAS air
concentrations; c) it is located near-shore (6.5 km) and downwind of the FPP, giving the
possibility of assessing the influence of sea-spray aerosol (SSA) on the atmospheric levels of
PFAS; and d) practical reasons, including a power supply for active sampling.

140
141
142

QFFs were baked in an oven at 450 ℃ for 24 hours and subsequently packed in aluminum foil
prior to use. A flow rate of 0.19-0.25 m3/min was used and about 1500 m3 of air was collected
per sample, corresponding to sampling times between 96 and 165 hours.

2.3.2 Surface water samples
Duplicate water samples were taken at the main discharge of the site on the River Wyre (‘W1’)
and a discharge point by the lagoon north of the main discharge. Single water samples were
taken at the surface water discharge near the Hillylaid Pool (the tributary receiving discharge
‘W2’), at a land drain to the north of the lagoon and a leaking pipe leading to the River Wyre
close to this land drain (Figure 1 and Figure S3-S7 in the SI). Unfortunately, the discharge
point 'W3' could not be sampled due to access limitations.

Water samples (50 mL each) were extracted in duplicate using Weak Anion Exchange (WAX)
solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Briefly, prior to extraction
the samples were spiked with 2000 pg 13C-labelled internal standards (IS, Table S1 in the SI).
The 3cc (60 mg) WAX cartridges were conditioned using 4 mL of methanol (MeOH, Supelco
Lichrosolv, Merck, Darmstadt, DE) with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28-30% v/v,
ACS-Reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, DE), subsequently the cartridges were equilibrated
using 4 mL of ultrapure water (Milli-Q, Merck, Darmstadt, DE). The samples were then loaded
and washed with 2 mL of pH 4 acetate buffer containing 2 mM acetic acid (>99.8% ACSReagent, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, DE) and 2mM ammonium acetate (NH4CH3CO2, ACSReagent, Merck, Darmstadt, DE) in Milli-Q and, subsequently, with 2 mL of MeOH. Elution was
performed using 2 x 750 μL of MeOH with 0.1% NH4OH. After elution the samples were
evaporated to almost dryness and reconstituted with MeOH and Milli-Q with 4 mM of
NH4CH3CO2, transferred to a LC-MS vial and spiked with 2000 pg Recovery Standard (RS).

Additionally, due to the possibility of high PFAS concentrations expected in some samples,
300 μL aliquots were taken from all water samples for direct injection. Prior to analysis, the
aliquots were spiked with 2000 pg IS and passed through a nylon centrifuge filter in an
Eppendorf tube. These were subsequently diluted 50:50 with MeOH and transferred to a 600
μL LC-MS vial, after which 2000 pg RS was added and the samples were ready for injection
and analysis.

2.4 UHPLC-HRMS analysis
Extracts were injected in a Dionex Ultimate 3000 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph
(UHPLC) linked to a Q-Exactive HF Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS). The mobile phase consisted of A: MilliQ:Acetonitrile (ACN, HPLC-grade, VWR, Rosny-sous-Bois-Cedex, FR) (95:5) and B:
ACN:Milli-Q (99:1), both with 2 mM ammonium acetate (NH4CH3CO2) and was led through a
Waters PFC Isolator column (Waters, Wilmslow, UK) after mixing. For separation, a 1.7 µm,
50 x 2.1 mm Waters Acquity BEH C18 column was used coupled with Waters Acquity BEH
C18 guard column (Waters, Wilmslow, UK), both maintained at 50ºC. The analytes were
ionized using an electrospray ionization source (ESI) operated in negative mode. The Orbitrap
was used in full scan mode (scan range: 150 – 1800 Da, resolution: 120,000 FWHM) and datadependent MS2 mode (resolution: 15,000 FWHM), with an inclusion list created from around
5000 potential PFAS masses derived from homologous series of PF(E)CAs and PF(E)SAs
with different moieties.

2.6 Data handling
The data analysis was conducted using Thermo Fisher TraceFinder™ version 4.1 software.
Quantification of individual PFAS was based on relative response of exact masses (5 ppm
mass error tolerance) to matched ISs using an 8-point calibration curve ranging from 0.03 to
135 pg/µL. Because isotopically labeled standards were not available for all PFAS in this study,
surrogate internal standards (i.e. non-exact matches) were used to quantify certain substances
as detailed in Table S1. Internal standard recoveries were calculated by comparing their
response areas to those of the recovery standards (RS; 13C8 PFOA or 13C8 PFOS; Table S1).

192
193
194
195
196
197

For the water samples, the instrumental limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs)
were calculated by taking the standard error of the residuals from the lowest three points on
the calibration curve. This value was then divided by the slope of the calibration curve and
multiplied by 10 to determine the LOQ and by 3.3 to calculate the LOD. For the air samples,
due to matrix effects leading to overall lower and more variable IS responses, method LODs
(MDLs) and LOQs (MQLs) were determined by taking the response area of the internal
standard in the sample into account.

2.7 Quality control
2.7.1 Air samples
Multiple field blanks were taken by inserting a QFF into the sampler and following the same
storage and transport procedure as the sample filters. Lab blanks were included in every
extraction by adding triplicate unused burned QFFs to the extraction procedure. Additionally,
a spike-and-recovery test was performed by fortifying a QFF with native analytes (2000 pg
each) and following the same extraction procedure.

208

2.7.2 Water samples
Included in the water SPE and direct injection samples were triplicate lab blanks consisting of
Milli-Q water and for the SPE-method a spike-and-recovery test was performed consisting of
Milli-Q water which was additionally spiked with 1000 pg mix of native (12C) PFAS.

2.8 Data processing
The suspect screening method used Thermo Fisher TraceFinder™ version 4.1 software in
conjunction with Thermo Fisher Xcalibur™ Qual Browser. The initial list of suspects was based
on matches (within 5 ppm mass error) to an in-house database used for the inclusion list during
instrumental analysis. This inclusion list was based on homologous series of perfluoroalkyl
acids with various moieties and functional groups and contained about 5000 exact masses.
Thereafter, suspect peaks were inspected manually for MS2 and in-source fragmentation
patterns, isotopic ratios, and retention times, which were compared to available literature.

Using the Schymanski scale 21, suspects were either assigned level 2a) when an MS2 scan
and a library spectrum match were acquired; 2b) without library match but with acquired MS2
and diagnostic evidence supporting the identification, such as retention time relative to PFCAs,
presence of homologous series and fragmentation patterns in MS1; or 3) similar diagnostic
evidence as 2b, but without acquired MS2. 21

2.9 Tracer ion analysis and meteorological parameters
Using previously described methodology 22, analyses of the presence and concentrations of
SSA tracer ions were carried out on punches of all QFFs. Average wind speed and direction
during sampling was calculated using equations S1-S5 in the SI.

3. Results & discussion
3.1 QA/QC
Similar to HFPO-DA and various other PFECAs, EEA shows very pronounced in-source
fragmentation. 24 As such, the most intense fragment is not the molecular ion ([M-H]-) but rather
the [M-CF2-COOH]- fragment, which could have an intensity up to an order of magnitude higher
than the molecular ion (Figure 2.). Therefore, this in-source fragment is used in the
quantification method along with the molecular ion by summing the response. The retention
time of EEA on the C18 column is similar to that of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), indicating
that the insertion of ether linkages slightly increases the hydrophobicity of the perfluoroalkyl
chain as EEA has the same number of perfluorinated carbons and the same head group as
PFHxA. Spike- and recovery tests with EEA for both the QFF and water extraction methods
yielded a recovery of 96% ± 6% and 109% ± 5% respectively and was similar to other PFAS
with comparable perfluoroalkyl chain lengths (Table S3 in the SI).

3.2 Water samples
3.2.1 Targeted analysis
ΣPFAS concentrations in water samples varied by nearly three orders of magnitude during the
sampling campaign (30 ng/L to 22.5 μg/L; Table S4). Remarkably, the main discharge (W1) of
the process water effluent had the lowest PFAS concentrations compared to all the other
sampling points. At the main discharge, the total measured PFAS concentrations (ΣPFAS)
were 30 ng/L (Main Discharge in Wyre 1) and 33 ng/L (Main Discharge in Wyre 2), while the
other sampling points all had PFAS levels within the μg/L range (Figure 3). Overall three
different PFAS profiles were encountered near the plant. The highest PFAS concentrations
were found to the north of the plant at a discharge near a lagoon (DBL) and at a land drain
north of the lagoon (WLD) and a leaking part of a long discharge pipe (WLPD) leading to the
River Wyre. PFOA was very prominent in these samples, with concentrations ranging from 891
± 37 ng/L to 20.62 ± 0.56 μg/L. Furthermore, in these samples other PFCAs, such as
perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), PFHxA, PFHpA and PFNA
are present in relatively high levels. There was also evidence of additional C8 PFAS, such as
hydrogen-substituted PFOA, chlorine-substituted PFOA, and ether-PFOA (Section 3.2.2 on
suspect screening). Concentrations of EEA in these samples ranged from 120.8 ± 0.3 ng/L to
205.5 ± 1.0 ng/L and were in a similar range as the levels of the C4-C7 PFCAs.

264
265
266
267
268
269

The Hillylaid Pool water had the highest levels of the replacement polymerization processing
aid EEA out of all of the discharge locations (1744.1 ± 106.8 ng/L). However, in samples taken
from the Hillylaid Pool and the main discharge, EEA had only slightly higher levels than PFOA
(Figure 3). For duplicates collected at the main discharge EEA concentrations were 21.17 ±
0.04 ng/L and 17.12 ± 0.40 ng/L respectively, considerably lower than the concentrations at
the Hillylaid Pool.

270
271
272
273
274
275
276
277

The levels of PFOA in the samples taken at the discharge by the lagoon (DBL) and the leaking
pipe (WLPD) were quantified using direct injection. which also yielded similar concentrations
and accuracy for PFOA as the SPE samples for the Hillylaid Pool and the Wyre land drain
(Figure S1 in the SI). The PFOA concentrations of the SPE samples DLB and WLPD were not
reported because the integrated areas of PFOA fell well above the calibration range and
significant detector saturation effects occurred associated with these high PFOA
concentrations, which led to suppression of the internal standard response and unreliable

The high PFOA concentrations are likely attributable to the extensive use of APFO for PTFE
production at the plant between 1955 and 2012, and unabated emissions of PFOA to the
environment during this time. Therefore, it could be that a large reservoir of PFOA and related
substances still exists within the perimeter of the industrial site. For instance, the samples with
the highest PFAS levels were taken around a discharge by a lagoon to the north of the site.
This lagoon was unfortunately not accessible during sampling, but should be the subject of
further investigation. Furthermore, documentation of the UK Environment Agency (UK EA),
points to the existence and former use of various other discharges, including a ‘North’
discharge. 25 Additionally, a landfill to the north of the site has been used until 2014 for disposal
of material from the plant, which included <5 tonnes of PFOA. 15 This landfill could potentially
be leaching large amounts of PFAS to the environment.

AGC Chemicals Europe has admitted that small amounts of PFOA and other PFCAs are
formed non-intentionally due to a process in which the molecular weight of PTFE micropowders
is altered using irradiation and thermal degradation. 26 These impurities are removed from the
polymer on-site and whether subsequent emissions occur remains unclear. However, it does

294

not seem likely that emissions could account for the levels found in the discharges, as a
maximum PFOA concentration in the ppb range is expected in the PTFE polymer itself. 26

Another interesting aspect of the detected PFCAs is the prominence of branched isomers.
These were identified by their shorter retention times and more pronounced in-source
fragmentation (e.g. decarboxylation and lower relative [M-H]- associated with shorter
perfluoroalkyl chains) relative to the linear isomer and IS (Figure S8 in the SI). Both the
presence of PFCAs of multiple chain lengths and the formation of branched isomers are
associated with PFCA production through electrochemical fluorination (ECF). 27 This process
is known to yield various structural isomers of PFOA as impurities. 28 However, as these
samples are taken post-polymerization, it could not be excluded that the formation of
polymerization by-products also plays a role in the presence of these substances.

Additional future research and sampling is necessary around the AGC Chemicals plant in order
to verify the very high PFAS levels (μg/L range) and possible emissions from these ‘alternative’
discharges. Elevated PFAS concentrations at these locations could potentially be explained
by re-emission from existing on-site PFAS reservoirs. However, it is crucial to rule out the
possibility that current production processes still involve either the use or formation of
significant quantities of PFOA and other PFAS, which could lead to subsequent emissions.
Further investigation is also needed to determine whether process water discharge points
other than W1 exist.

The high concentration of EEA (1744 ± 107 ng/L) found in the Hillylaid Pool is especially
interesting in this regard. Due to this elevated level and the occurrence of the suspects of class
7. (Section 3.2.2), the PFAS profile in this water might more accurately reflect current use and
emissions. Additionally, the relatively high level of the monoether-PFBA quantified here could
possibly be a byproduct of the liquid-phase fluorination process used to produce EEA 29 or a
product of the hydrolysis of PPVE, a co-monomer used on-site.

318
319
320

Lastly, it should be emphasized that PFAS concentrations found in these water samples are
potentially problematic regardless of their origins and should be abated in order to prevent
further contamination of the River Wyre and the estuarine area.

3.2.2 Suspect screening
In addition to the PFAS that were quantified using standards, a total of 55 different PFAS
suspects were identified in the water samples through the analysis of homologous series
consisting of multiple per- or polyfluoroalkyl chain lengths (–CF2–)x (Table S8 in the SI). These
suspects were classified into seven groups: 1. hydrogen-substituted PFCAs (H-PFCAs), 2.
chlorine-substituted PFCAs (Cl-PFCAs), 3. monoether PFECAs. (ME-PFECAs) 4. cyclical
monoether PFECAs (Cyc. ME-PFECAs) 5. dihydrogen-substituted PFOA (6:2 FTA and
structural isomers), 6. hydrogen-substituted homologs of class 2. and 3. and 7.
polyhydrogenated PFCAs (H=3-5).

343

The highest responses for suspect classes 1-6 were found in the samples with the highest
targeted PFAS levels taken at the discharge close by the lagoon (Table S9 in the SI).
Furthermore, most of the detected homologous series had the highest response at the C8
homolog (Table S9 and Figure S9-S12 in the SI). Response areas in the quantification
injections of these samples for C8 homologs were comparable to those of EEA: H-PFOA
(8.8e7), Cl-PFOA (2.8e7), cyclic-ether PFOA (2.8e7), EEA (4.9e7). Thus, when assuming
similar response factors for these suspects as PFOA, the concentrations of these suspects in
this sample could be similar to those of EEA and C4-C7 PFCAs and in the hundreds of ng/L.
Although the response areas were lower, these suspects were identified in other samples too
(Table S8 in the SI) and have been identified in other studies close to fluoropolymer production
plants in Asia. 30,31

For all suspect classes it is probable that multiple branched isomers are present in the
samples, due to multiple peaks for the same exact masses at earlier retention times in the
chromatograms, similar to the PFCAs. Due to the very high concentrations of PFOA with a
probable ECF signature in these samples (μg/L range), it is likely that most of these suspects
are by-products of ECF such as H-PFCAs, along with the cyclical monoether PFECAs which
have also been reported as impurities or by-products of ECF. 28, 32 Cl-PFCAs have also been

reported in Asia, where ECF PFOA is still used 30 and some fluorination processes used by
AGC reportedly use chlorinated molecules as starting materials. 29 Unfortunately, and similar
to earlier reported data from Asia 30, 33, it remains difficult to acquire accurate MS2 spectra for
Cl-PFCAs using Orbitrap HRMS. Although MS2 scans are triggered by the molecular ions,
these scans contain only noise and no clear fragment peaks. We suspect that only a chlorine
fragment (m/z = 35 or 37) is ionized, which is below the lower mass threshold (m/z = 50) of the
Orbitrap scan range and that the rest of the molecule could form a neutral loss. Still, and similar
to PFCAs, decarboxylated fragments were detected for Cl-PFCAs in MS1 (Figure S9 in the SI).
These fragments also triggered MS2 scans with similar issues as those of the molecular ion.

359
360

AGC currently uses liquid-phase fluorination instead of telomerization for producing EEA and
other fluorochemical building blocks. 29 It should be investigated whether this method still leads
to significant formation of impurities and by-products and if these products could be present in
the fluoropolymer processing aid that is subsequently used on-site.

363
364
365
366
367
368
369

Other possible formation processes may also contribute to the presence of the reported
suspects. H-PFCAs, for instance, are known polymerization by-products in the production of
PTFE. 8 Additionally, H-PFCAs have been reported to form as a result of reductive
dechlorination of Cl-PFCAs. 34 Lastly, the substance chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) is
registered by AGC Chemicals Europe and so it cannot be excluded that the chlorinated PFAS
encountered in this study are a result of by-product formation after the use of CTFE as comonomer.

In addition to the highest EEA concentrations, samples from the Hillylaid Pool also had the
highest responses of class 7 suspects. Due to the multiple hydrogen substitutions, it could be
that these suspects are more susceptible to biotransformation than PFAS with perfluoroalkyl
chains and therefore over time have gradually disappeared from the other PFAS reservoirs.
This observation, along with the relatively high levels of EEA and the overall different PFAS
profile in the Hillylaid Pool compared to the samples taken north of the main discharge could
support the hypothesis that the PFAS measured in the Hillylaid Pool reflects recent emissions.
The PFAS profile of the samples taken north of the discharge could reflect leaching of PFAS
that have accumulated over multiple years.

3.3 Air samples
PFAS were detected in all air samples taken at the Hazelrigg Meteorological Station with
concentrations ranging from 0.29 to 5.43 pg/m3 (Figure 4 and Table S5). PFOA was prominent
in these samples, with detection in 20 out of 21 of these samples and concentrations ranging
from 0.51 to 2.50 pg/m3 (Figure 4). Branched PFOA isomers were also detected in all of these
samples. For the one sample where PFOA was not detected, the response of the IS was very
poor, resulting in high MDLs/MQLs for all analytes (Table S6-S7 in the SI). High air
concentrations of PFOA and ΣPFAS were associated with high wind speeds from the
southwest direction (Figure 5 & Table S5). PFOS and PFHxS were detected in all air samples,
albeit with lower peak concentrations (PFOS; 0.49 pg/m3) or at levels between MDL and MQL
(PFHxS).

390
391
392
393
394
395

Notably, EEA was only detected in three out of the four samples with the highest PFOA
concentrations. The concentrations of EEA in these samples were 0.28 (between MDL and
MQL), 0.66 and 2.02 pg/m3 and PFHxA and PFBA were also above MDL in these samples,
but below MQL, while PFHpA and the long-chain PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA were above MQL
and PFDoDA was above MQL in the two of these samples (Figure 4 and 5 and Table S5 in the
SI).

The presence of PFOA, EEA and the PFCAs in the samples not only coincided with high wind
speeds from the direction of the AGC Chemicals plant, but also with high sodium (Na +) tracer
ion concentrations that are a proxy for the levels of sea-spray aerosols (SSA). The two air
samples (HAZ-14 and HAZ-15) with the highest PFOA concentrations, EEA responses and
only samples with C9-C12 PFCA levels all above MQL and with responses of the suspects
previously described were also samples with highest Na+ levels (Table S5 in the SI). For PFOA
and PFHxS the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (ρ) with Na+ were 0.41 and 0.50
respectively. However, for PFOA, this correlation was not statistically significant by a slight
margin (p=0.07), while for PFHxS it was (p=0.02). As such, the concentrations of atmospheric
PFOA could also be influenced to a minor extent by other sources, such as direct emissions
by AGC Chemicals, the re-suspension of previously deposited PFOA from other areas and
transformation of volatile precursors or urban emissions. PFOS did not show a statistically
significant correlation with Na+ (ρ = 0.17, p=0.45) and for the other analytes the concentrations
and detection frequencies were too low to draw conclusions on correlations with the Na+ tracer
ion.

In the samples with the highest PFOA and EEA concentrations, trace responses of some of
the suspects described in section 3.2.2 were also detected (Figure S12 and S13 in the SI).
Compared to the water samples, these responses and those of the other PFCAs were more
pronounced for the longer-chained homologs (>C8). SSA enrichment factors of perfluoroalkyl
acids with a perfluoroalkyl chain length of seven or more are significantly higher than those
with shorter perfluoroalkyl chain lengths. 35, 36 As such, with similar water concentrations, air
concentrations of these homologs would be relatively higher compared to their shorter-chained
counterparts. On the other hand, the long-range atmospheric transport potential of shorterchained PFAS is similar or higher compared to long-chained PFAS, due to PFAS preferably
binding to particle size ranges in the accumulation mode. 37, 38 If direct emissions were the
dominant source for the measured air PFAS concentrations, the relative concentrations of
short-chained homologs and PFCAs would be expected to be similar at Hazelrigg. However,
these are measured at lower concentrations or not measured at all compared to concentrations
in the water in the direct vicinity of the plant. More sampling data needs to be collected to
statistically strengthen the correlations between air concentrations of PFOA, EEA, long-chain
PFAS and the Na+ tracer ion at Hazelrigg. Although the current evidence remains largely
circumstantial and based on a limited sample size (n=21), it is suspected that enrichment of
PFAS in SSA is currently the dominant driver of the atmospheric concentrations of PFAS
related to AGC emissions measured in Hazelrigg. Additionally, the measured concentrations
of PFOA (peak 2.50 pg/m3) and EEA (peak 2.02 pg/m3) are much lower than the PFOA peak
level of 828 pg/m3 found in 2007 20, before the installation of the emission abatement system
that could have significantly reduced the impact of air emissions directly from the stacks of the
plant. However, documents from the UK EA indicate that this system was not operational
during the first quarter of 2023 and part of the first quarter of 2024. 39,40 Further investigation is
necessary in order to understand how periods of non-operational emission abatement system
affect environmental PFAS levels.

3.4 Implications
This study shows that the AGC Chemicals site continues to be a source of legacy and scarcely
monitored PFAS to the local environment through direct emissions and/or leaching of PFAS
reservoirs such as old discharges, the local landfill or lagoon. A large fraction of these
emissions flow into the River Wyre estuary, which drains into the strongly tidal Morecambe
Bay. This area is important as a wildlife habitat and for shellfish harvesting. Recently, elevated
levels of PFOA were reported in otters with their habitats close to the AGC Chemicals plant. 42
Further monitoring data are required to establish the extent of PFAS contamination in the River
Wyre and Morecambe Bay food web in order to assess the effects of the continued emissions
of legacy and alternative PFAS from the AGC Chemicals site. Very little is known about the
properties of the scarcely monitored PFAS identified in this study, but one might assume given
their similar structures to PFCAs that they might have similar persistence, bioaccumulation
potential and toxicities. Further research on the properties, including toxicities, of the identified

PFAS is required before human and environmental risk assessments can be performed.
Secondary emissions of PFAS from the ocean due to their enrichment on sea spray aerosol
could lead to additional deposition of long-chain homologs in coastal areas in the Morecambe
Bay and our study shows that sea spray aerosol transport of PFAS could also be an additional
secondary source to air for several legacy PFAS (notably PFHxS, PFOA and some long-chain
PFCAs) as well as the replacement substance EEA and the scarcely monitored suspects (HPFCAs, Cl-PFCAs and ME-PFECAs). These identified suspects are most likely to be byproducts of electrochemical or liquid-phase fluorination or polymerization.
