Abstract
Nitrate anion (NO3–) is a ubiquitous species in aqueous phases in the environment,
including atmospheric particles, aerosol droplets, surface waters, and snow. The photolysis of NO3– is a ’renoxification’ process, which converts NO3– solvated in water or
deposited on surfaces back into NOx to the atmosphere. NO3– photolysis under environmental conditions can follow two channels: (1) NO2 and O–; (2) NO2– and O (3P).
Despite the well-studied macroscopic kinetics of the two channels, the microscopic picture of the photolysis still needs to be explored. Furthermore, previous experiments
have shown that NO3– photolysis in aqueous solutions has a low quantum yield of
⇠1%, leading to a solvation cage e↵ect hypothesis. A previous theoretical study has
indicated that the low quantum yield may be due to the direct spin-forbidden absorption of NO3– to its triplet state. Here, we employ first-principles molecular dynamics

simulations at the level of hybrid DFT with enhanced sampling to explore the two
channels in an aqueous solution to unravel the atomistic and electronic structure details of the photolysis, as well as investigate the causes of its low quantum yield under
a solvation environment. The direct spin-forbidden absorption to T1 state is viable
through spin-orbit coupling and is ⇠15 times weaker than the spin-allowed absorption to S1 state. A solvation cage complex is identified as a metastable state that
requires additional thermal energy to complete the dissociation of the N-O bond at
the triplet state. This metastable state allows the photo fragments to recombine or
deactivate through non-radiative processes. Our simulations also qualitatively explain
the temperature dependence of the two channels observed in experiments based on the
rearrangement of H-bonds. This work provides a novel molecular picture illustrating
the significantly low quantum yield and temperature dependence of NO3– photolysis
under environmental conditions and a starting point for future studies of environmental
nitrate photochemistry.

Introduction
The nitrate anion (NO3– ) is a primary species in the global nitrogen cycle. 1 It is ubiquitous in
the environment, including aerosol particles, surface waters, and Polar snow. Atmospheric
NO3– is formed from the oxidation of NOx (NO + NO2), which is emitted by fossil fuel
combustion and other sources. 2,3 Under environmental conditions, NO3– in solution absorbs
light over a broad band centered at ⇠300 nm, i.e., 4.1 eV, and photolysis can occur via two
channels: 4,5

atmosphere indicate that NO3– photolysis in sea salt aerosols is a significant source of NOx, 7–9
accounting for the missing source of NOx in a macroscopic chemical model of the atmosphere
over the oceans. 10 Furthermore, NO3– photolysis can play a crucial role in sulfate formation
during the co-uptake of SO2 and NO2 by sea salt aerosols. 11 Therefore, the photolysis of NO3–
under environmental conditions is of great interest to the environmental science community.
Secondary products of NO3– photolysis have an environmental impact too. In the presence
of water molecules, the O– produced in Channel (1) is rapidly protonated to form a hydroxyl
radical, which is one of the most important oxidants in the atmosphere. 1,2 Under acidic
conditions, NO2– generated in Channel (2) is converted to its protonated form nitrous acid
(HONO), which is also a crucial photochemical source of hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide. 12
NO3– photolysis in solution has been studied for decades. 4,12–17 Experiments show that in
an aqueous solution at room temperature, the quantum yields of the two channels are comparable, with 1.2 ± 0.2% for Channel (1) and 1.1 ± 0.2% for Channel (2). 12,15 Such very low
quantum yields led to the hypothesis of a solvation cage e↵ect, in which the dissociated fragments recombine before they di↵use out of a cage of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. 18–21
This hypothesis is supported by experiments showing the enhancement of NO3– photolysis
rates at the air-water and air-ice interfaces, where the solvation cage e↵ect may be weakened. 22–27 Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations probing the structure of the
solvation shell of ground-state NO3– in water and at the air-ice interface are not conclusive in
this regard, and calculations of the UV-visible absorption spectrum exclude that photolysis
rate enhancement could be even partially attributed to a solvatochromic shift, in contrast
to the case of organic pollutants. 28–30
The relative significance of the two channels at di↵erent conditions is also still unclear.
Experiments suggest that Channel (1) is more favorable at higher temperatures, whereas
Channel (2) is more prominent at lower temperatures, especially in the liquid-like pockets in
ice. 31 Scharko et al. observed that Channel (2) has a higher yield in acidic aqueous solutions
as it produces HONO. 17 This secondary reaction was also predicted by AIMD simulations

in the ground state. 32 Besides the acidity, Scharko et al. suggested that the hydrolysis of
NO2 generated in Channel (1) can also be responsible for additional HONO formation, in
aqueous solutions. 17 Hullar et al. observed that the quantum yield of NO2– in a quasi-liquid
layer at the air-ice interface is enhanced by a factor of 6.4 over a bulk aqueous solution at the
same temperature. 27 Considering these experimental findings, factors other than secondary
reactions should be responsible for the enhancement of the quantum yield at the air-ice
interface.
Quantum chemical calculations of the excited state NO3– revealed that only Channel
(2) is energetically viable in the gas phase and in implicit solvent models. 33–37 The lowest
energy spin-allowed excitation for NO3– corresponds to a S0 ! S1 symmetry forbidden n !
⇡* transition that can be enabled only by coupling with vibrational modes. 33,34,36 The S1
state may be unbound as its gas-phase energy is close to the electron detachment energy, and
we are not aware of any experimental gas-phase observations of bound excited states of NO3–
. 34–36,38,39 In solution, the electron affinity increases, and the symmetry of NO3– is lowered
from D3h to C2v favoring light absorption and photolysis under environmental conditions. 25,36
However, the S1 potential energy surface is not conducive to Channel (2), as the products
are in the triplet state. As intersystem crossing from the S1 state is unlikely, Svoboda and
Slavı́ček suggested that NO3– photolysis may be enabled by direct spin-forbidden absorption
from S0 to the first triplet state T1 . 35 Furthermore, a minimum energy conical intersection
between the S0 and S1 states near the FC point suggests that the majority of S1 excited NO3–
undergoes a non-radiative deactivation to the ground state. These results call for further
investigation of NO3– photolysis in an explicit solvation environment to assess the hypothesis
of direct spin-forbidden absorption and probe the molecular mechanisms that enable Channel
(1).
Here, we explore NO3– photolysis in water by AIMD in the first excited triplet state,
explicitly modeling the solvation environment and exploring the reaction free energy surface
with enhanced sampling. We first calculate the potential energy surfaces of the low-lying

singlet and triplet states of NO3– along the dissociation coordinate in the gas phase with
multi-reference quantum chemical methods to assess the dissociation limit of each electronic
state and to assess the accuracy of a hybrid density functional for this problem. We then
sample the ground state configurations (S0 ) of NO3– in water at room temperature by AIMD
and compute the UV-visible absorption spectrum by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), including both the spin-allowed and the direct spin-forbidden excitations, 40
exploiting a multimodel approach established in previous works. 28,41 We find that the direct
spin-forbidden absorption to the T1 state is viable through spin-orbit coupling, although
about 15 times weaker than the spin-allowed absorption to the S1 state. We follow by using
ab initio metadynamics 42–44 to simulate the dissociation of NO3– in the explicit water in the
T1 state, from which we obtain free energy barriers and reaction rates to compute the quantum yield of the two reaction channels with a master equation model. These simulations
show that surrounding water molecules trap NO3– (T1 ) in a weakly metastable solvation cage
complex. From the solvation cage complex, the system may evolve through either Channel
(1) or (2) with a relative likelihood dictated by the di↵erent rearrangement of the hydrogen
bonding in the solvation shell of the products, thus explaining the temperature dependence
observed in experiments. The current study provides a novel microscopic picture illustrating
the low experimental quantum yields of NO3– photolysis in aqueous solvation environments.

Computational Methods
Quantum Chemical Calculations
Before performing AIMD simulations of solvated nitrate, we computed the potential energy surface of gas phase NO3– along the N-O dissociation coordinate in the ground state
and the low-lying triplet and singlet excited states at the level of multi-reference N-electron
valence state perturbation theory at the second order with the quasi-degenerate extension
(QD-NEVPT2) to account for correlation. 45,46 The ground state geometries along the N-O

bond dissociation coordinate were first optimized at the level of broken-symmetry DFT with
CAM-B3LYP range-separated hybrid density functional and ma-def2-TZVP basis set. 47–49
It has been found that the equilibrium structure computed by the CAM-B3LYP functional
and a triple-zeta basis set agrees well with CCSD values. 36 The QD-NEVPT2 calculations
were then performed over the optimized ground state geometries to build up the potential
energy surfaces of the low-lying singlet and triplet excited states. The orbitals and references
used in the QD-NEVPT2 calculations were obtained by previous state-averaged complete
active space self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF) calculations. 50 For each geometry along the
dissociation coordinate, the SA-CASSCF calculations considered an active space of ten electrons in nine orbitals. Three singlet states (including the ground state) and four triplet
states were included in the calculations. The strongly contracted formalism of NEVPT2
was used with the quasi-degenerate extension based on Van Vleck perturbation theory using
the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. 51–53 The vertical excitation energies from the equilibrium geometry were compared with the multi-reference configuration interaction method with Davidson
correction for linked quadruples (MRCI+Q) using the same active space and basis set. 54 To
assess the reliability of the DFT framework that we use to simulate the reaction in with
explicit water, we also performed the same calculations on the ground state and the T1 state
using the hybrid functional revPBE0 55,56 with D3 dispersion correction 57 and the def2-SVP
basis set 58,59 (see section S1). The solvation model of density (SMD) 60 was used to account
for the implicit solvation in water. This hybrid functional with dispersion correction was
later used for simulating the dissociation dynamics at the T1 state with explicit waters. All
the potential energy surface calculations in the gas phase and under implicit solvation were
carried out with ORCA 5.0.2. 61

Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To capture the local e↵ect of hydrogen bonding on the light absorption and photodissociation
of NO3– , we performed AIMD simulations of a bulk ammonium nitrate aqueous solution with

explicit water. DFT-based AIMD simulations were performed using Quickstep 62 in the CP2K
8.2 package. 63 The nuclear dynamics were propagated by the Born-Oppenheimer forces. A
convergence criterion of 1 ⇥ 10 5 Hartree was used to optimize the wave function. The
hybrid exchange-correlation density functional revPBE0 with Grimme dispersion correction
(D3) was employed to evolve the dynamics of a 12.98 x 12.98 x 12.98 Å box with 1 unit of
NH4 NO3 and 63 water molecules with periodic boundary condition for an aqueous solution
model. 55–57 Previous studies have shown that revPBE0-D3 provides a good description of
water and aqueous systems. 64,65 The ammonium ion was used as a counterion because it
is abundant in atmospheric droplets and particulates containing NO3– . 2 Valence KohnSham orbitals were expanded in the DZVP Gaussian basis set together with the plane-waves
auxiliary basis set, while core states were treated implicitly using Goedecker–Teter–Hutter
pseudopotentials. 66–68 A 400 Ry energy cuto↵ was set for the plane-wave basis set. AIMD
simulations in an aqueous solution were run under the canonical (NVT) ensemble with
a temperature of 300 K using the stochastic velocity-rescaling thermostat with a 100 ps
coupling time. 69 In these simulations, hydrogen atoms were replaced with deuterium, thus
allowing a relatively large timestep of 0.5 fs to integrate the equations of motion. The system
was run for 25 ps in total, with the first 5 ps serving as the equilibration and 20 ps serving
as the production run.
Former studies have shown that NO3– in aqueous solutions, adsorption, and solvation
at the air-water and air-ice interfaces are accurately reproduced using a semi-local density
functional with dispersion corrections. 28,70–72 However, to model the S0 ! T1 transition,
semi-local density functionals should not be used, as they lead to a substantial underestimate
of the energy gap of solvent in which NO3– is embedded. In particular, for the case of water,
the energy di↵erence between the valence and the conduction band with the Perdew, Burke,
Ernzehof (PBE) functional 73 is only 4 eV, as opposed to ⇠9 eV as expected from experiments
and higher-level electronic structure calculations. 74–77 Recalling that the vertical excitation
energy of NO3– is ⇠4 eV, triplet state NO3– at the PBE level is quasi-degenerate with

the water conduction band. This causes an unphysical electron delocalization and drives
dissociation along Channel (1), which turns out to be the only possible pathway (see section
S2 and Figure S2 for details). In this respect, a hybrid density functional with dispersion
corrections, revPBE0-D3, was used as it provides a more realistic representation of the
electronic structure of materials despite an increased computational cost. 55–57,78,79

UV-Visible Absorption Spectra Calculations
To compute the finite temperature UV-visible absorption spectrum of solvated NO3– , we
adopted a multimodel approach that proved accurate and predictive for organic solvents and
ammonium nitrate. 28,29,41 The oscillator strengths and UV-visible absorption energies were
calculated as the ensemble average of 800 vertical excitations from the individual frames
extracted from the 20 ps production run. These extracted frames were embedded in a
hybrid solvation model, where the first two solvation shells of NO3– , which corresponded to
12 water molecules, were treated explicitly, and the long-range screening was accounted by
the CPCM polarizable implicit solvent, with a static dielectric constant of 80.3 and refractive
index 1.33. 80 The oscillator strengths of S0 ! S1 and S0 ! T1 transitions, as well as the
UV-visible absorption spectra at a finite temperature were calculated at the level of TDDFT,
with CAM-B3LYP functional. 48 It has been shown that CAM-B3LYP accurately models the
excited states of NO3– under implicit solvation and solvated by a small water cluster. 34–36 The
spin-forbidden absorption was calculated by including spin-orbit coupling between singlet
and triplet states using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. 81 All the TDDFT calculations
were performed using a ma-def2-TZVP basis set 49 along with the resolution of identity
approximation for the Coulomb and exchange integrals using the ORCA 5.0.2 package. 61 The
UV-visible spectra were obtained from the Gaussian envelopes with an empirical broadening
width of 0.027 eV.

Ab Initio Metadynamics in the T1 State
Under the assumption of a direct spin-forbidden transition to the T1 State, the system was
simulated in the T1 state at the level of spin-polarized hybrid DFT (revPBE0-D3), to probe
the dissociation dynamics of NO3– . The computational details of all AIMD simulations at
the T1 were the same as the AIMD simulations in the ground state.
Preliminary simulations show that NO3– (T1 ) is metastable and does not dissociate spontaneously within 2 ps, as opposed to the spontaneous dissociation in gas-phase photochemistry (see Figure S3). Well-tempered metadynamics 43,44 was used as an enhanced sampling
method to overcome and estimate the dissociation barrier and explore the reaction free energy landscape. In metadynamics simulations, a bias potential is continuously applied to
the system, which depends on the set of predefined collective variables (CVs), where CVs
are functions of atomic positions. 44 In this study, well-tempered metadynamics was used
in which the height of the deposited Gaussians would decrease exponentially as the bias is
applied:

Two CVs (d, n) were chosen to be applied to the well-tempered metadynamics simulation
(Figure 1). The first CV, d, is the distance between atom N and O1, corresponding to
the dissociation coordinate. However, it is not enough to di↵erentiate the two dissociation
channels. Since the two channels only di↵er in the net negative charge localization and are
comparable in an aqueous solution, one can hypothesize that the solvation structure of NO3–
is crucial to determine which channel it will eventually proceed. Based on this hypothesis, a
second CV, n, was used to describe the number of H atoms surrounding atoms O2 and O3
(see Figure 1). While the net negative charge of NO2– makes it form hydrogen bonds with
water, it has been shown that NO2 does not form extensive hydrogen bonds with water. 82

Therefore, the number of H atoms surrounding atoms O2 and O3 can be a suitable CV
candidate to drive the dissociation and di↵erentiate the two channels. This number, n, is
defined as follow:

simulation, where On refers to the O atoms of NO3– .

The well-tempered metadynamics simulation was carried out at the T1 state after a 2
ps unbiased equilibration run initiated by exciting a ground-state configuration in the T1
state. The initial height of the Gaussian W was 5.0 kJ/mol, and the widths were 0.1 Å
and 0.15. The bias factor was set at 25. A new Gaussian was deposited at every 25 fs. A
harmonic restraining potential wall with a force constant of 100 kJ/mol Å2 was applied on
d when it was greater than 4 Å to limit the exploration of the dissociated state. To better
exploit parallel hardware architecture and enhance the sampling efficiency, we employed

the multiple walkers approach. 83 In a multiple walkers metadynamics simulation, multiple
simulations (walkers) explore the same free energy surface (FES), contributing to the same
history-dependent bias potential. Two walkers were used in the current study, and the
update frequency of the sharing between the two deposited biases was set to 0.5 ps. The
multiple-walkers well-tempered metadynamics simulations were run for 52 ps (26 ps for each
walker). The FES was calculated by reweighing the frames from the two walkers using the
time dependence of the metadynamics bias potential. The convergence was evaluated by the
di↵usion of CVs (recrossings of the free energy barriers) and the average error of the relative
free energy against time through block analysis. 84,85
We calculated the rate constants from the free energy barriers using transition state
theory. For the non-radiative deactivation to the ground state through intersystem crossing,
we applied Fermi’s golden rule combined with the path integral approach. 86–88 This method
includes the coupling of electronic spin-orbit coupling with vibrational degrees of freedom,
which can describe the intersystem crossing rates of small organic molecules with negligible
electronic spin-orbit coupling. 89 A recent study showed that this method can estimate the
intersystem crossing rates of small aromatic organic molecules qualitatively. 90 More details
on these calculations are provided in section S6.

Results and Discussion
Potential Energy Surfaces in the Gas Phase
In solution, NO3– absorbs light over a broad band with a maximum at 305 nm corresponding to 4.05 eV. Gas-phase calculations indicate that this energy corresponds to the S0 !
S1 transition. S1 and T1 states are the only relevant excited states under environmental
conditions as the energy absorption band is at the high energy edge of the solar spectrum.
We computed the main features of the gas-phase photodissociation potential energy surface
by ab intio quantum chemical methods and DFT using the same functional as in the AIMD

simulations. The vertical excitation energies, the energies of the photolysis products, and
the vertical electron detachment energy, calculated by QD-NEVPT2, MRCI+Q, and DFT,
are reported in Table 1. The excitation energies to the T1 and S1 states are very close to
the vertical electron detachment energy which was formerly measured as ⇠3.9 eV. 38,39 In
fact, bound excited states of negatively charged complex anions were never observed experimentally. Both MRCI and DFT calculations reproduce the experimental vertical electron
detachment energy whereas QD-NEVPT2 overestimates it (4.38 eV). All three methods suggest that the T1 state should be bound in the gas phase (Table 1 and S1). We speculate
here that the T1 state might be bound in the gas phase, although these calculations cannot
firmly establish its existence. In contrast, both QD-NEVPT2 and MRCI+Q predict the S1
excitation energy to be within 0.1 eV of the electron detachment energy, with QD-NEVPT2
slightly higher and MRCI+Q lower. These results are in agreement with previous EOMCCSD calculations 35 and suggest that the S1 state of NO3– is not bound in gas phase.
However, experiments show that the electron detachment energy increases from ⇠3.9 eV to
⇠6.1 eV under aqueous solvation. 39 In contrast, the excitation energy to the S1 state does
not shift upon solvation and remains ⇠4.1 eV. 39,91,92 Therefore, the S1 state of NO3– becomes
a bound state in solution.

species after dissociation are shown in dashed lines.
tematically overestimated compared with MRCI+Q and experiments, the former more computationally efficient method provides the same energy di↵erence of ⇠0.2 eV between the S1
and T1 states, in agreement with Ref. 35 Hence we use QD-NEVPT2 to calculate the potential energy surfaces of the low-lying electronic states of gas-phase NO3– along the dissociation
coordinate (Figure 2). The dissociation limit of the S0 state corresponds to Channel (1).
While the dissociation limit of the S1 state is the same as the S0 state, the S2 state produces
a NO2– and an O atom at its lowest singlet excited state (1 D). The three lowest triplet states
(T1 , T2 , and T3 ) dissociate into Channel (2). Conversely, T4 dissociates into Channel (1),
and it is degenerate with the dissociation limits of the S0 and S1 states. This calculation
verifies the suggestion that singlet and triplet states are degenerate at the dissociation limit
of Channel (1). It is worth noting that the S1 and T1 states are quasi-degenerate for intact
NO3– . This also matches the previously calculated potential energy surfaces of the two states
at MRCI level. 35
To further assess the reliability of the hybrid functional with dispersion correction, which
was used to simulate the dissociation dynamics at the T1 state in an aqueous solution, we

scanned the ground state and the T1 potential energy surfaces at the level of revPBE0D3/def-SVP with an implicit solvation model (see Figure S1). The potential energy curves
of the two states agree qualitatively with the NEVPT2 calculations in Figure 2. These results
and the energies reported in Table 1 show that revPBE0-D3 with a double zeta basis set is
reliable in providing the correct dissociation limits in aqueous solution.
Gas phase calculations support the former observation that only Channel (2) is energetically viable, as the products of Channel (1) are about 1 eV higher in energy (see Table 1). 35
To make Channel (1) viable, its relative energy should be lowered when NO3– is solvated in
water. In fact, Svoboda and Slavı́ček calculated the reaction Gibbs free energies for both
channels from the reaction Gibbs free energies in the gas phase and the hydration Gibbs
free energies for all species. They have found that the energy di↵erence of Channel (1) is
indeed lowered and becomes energetically plausible under implicit aqueous solvation at a
finite temperature. 35 This suggests that NO3– photolysis under aqueous solvation can proceed to both channels on the triplet potential energy surface. We notice that the S1 and T1
potential energy curves Figure 2 exhibit a significant dissociation barrier. This may be due
to the system not being adiabatically optimized on the excited state surfaces, as the excited
state energies were calculated from optimized ground state structures.

Even though the direct S0 ! T1 transition is spin-forbidden, it may be enabled by spinorbit coupling, and can be computed using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. 81 Here, we
assess the significance of the direct spin-forbidden transition of NO3– in an aqueous solution
at room temperature by calculating the oscillator strengths and the UV-visible absorption
spectra at the level of TDDFT. We use a mixed implicit/explicit solvent approach, treating
explicitly the water molecules in the first and second solvation shells of NO3– (see also 28 ).
Table 2 summarizes the calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths compared
with experimental values. 91,92 The calculated excitation energy of the S1 state agrees with

the light absorption measurements remarkably well. Due to the limited available statistics,
the calculated oscillator strength of the S1 excitation has a large uncertainty. However, it
has an order of magnitude ranging from 10 5 to 10 4 , which agrees with the experimental
values in the literature. 91,92 This range of values is low, as the S0 ! S1 transition is symmetry
forbidden and it is enabled only by the finite temperature dynamics of NO3– and symmetry
breaking e↵ect of the solvation environment.
Spin-orbit coupling calculations allow us to determine the excitation energy of the S0 !
T1 transition as 3.74 eV (⇠ 330 nm) with an oscillator strength of 4 ⇥ 10 6 . Comparing
the oscillator strengths between the two absorptions indicates that the direct spin-forbidden
transition is about 15 times weaker than the spin-allowed transition.

Figure 3 shows that the direct excitation to T1 can contribute to the low-energy tail
of the UV-visible absorption band observed in experiments. The experimental UV-visible
absorption spectrum shows a broad peak from 280 to 340 nm and is centered at 302 nm,
which is usually assigned as the absorption corresponding to the S1 state (see Figure 3). The
calculated spectrum of the S1 excitation agrees well with the experimental spectrum in terms
of

max but is substantially narrower. Experimentally, the absorption peak corresponding to

the T1 state may be buried in this broad absorption peak due to its low oscillator strength.
Our calculations confirm this hypothesis as they predict a weak and broad absorption band
centered at 328 nm for the S0 ! T1 . These results suggest that the S0 ! T1 transition is
possible and significant for NO3– photolysis.

Free Energy Surface of NO3– (T1 ) in Water
Since NO3– (T1 ) does not dissociate in 2 ps after the vertical excitation to the T1 state,
metadynamics simulations are performed to estimate the dissociation barriers. To assess
the reliability of the metadynamics simulation and the choice of CVs - N-O distance, and
coordination number of the NO2 fragment - in the spirit of commitment probability analysis,
we run eight unbiased AIMD simulations starting from configurations near the first transition
state with randomized velocities. Four of the trajectories return to the initial intact NO3–
(T1 ) state, and the two dissociation channels are observed in the other four trajectories, two
for Channel (1) and two for Channel (2). The two channels are clearly distinguished by
the second CV, n, with the confirmation of the atomic charges and spin densities by Bader
charge analysis (see Figure S4 and Table S2 for details). 93,94 The multiple-walkers welltempered metadynamics simulation was run for 52 ps and dissociation along both channels
was observed. The metadynamics simulation can be considered reasonably well-converged
based on the di↵usion of the CVs, recrossings of barriers, and the average error of the relative
free energy against time through block analysis. 84,85 Figure S6 shows that several recrossings
among the metastable states have occurred. While Walker 1 has only explored Channel (2),
Walker 2 has explored both channels. The block analysis is performed using the last 39 ps
(75% of the whole data) of the simulation. The average error of the free energy surface has
reached ⇠ 2 kJ/mol with a block size of 9.5 ps (Figure S7a), and the maximum error is ⇠ 3
kJ/mol (Figure S7b).
The calculated FES shows 4 basins corresponding to 4 metastable states (Figure 4). To
characterize the 4 states, we perform a Bader charge analysis on four frames extracted from
the corresponding basins. 93,94 The result of the Bader charge analysis, including the spin
densities, are reported in Table 3. The free energy barriers between pairs of contiguous
basins are calculated by minimum energy pathway analysis using the MEPSA software, 95
and are summarized in Table S3. The results are compatible with the experimental estimates
of the activation energies. 15,31 The initial state A corresponds to the intact NO3– (T1 ) (d ⇠1.3

Å, n ⇠3.2). In this state, the two unpaired electrons are localized on NO3– with Bader charge
-0.83 e and spin density 2.0. The system then overcomes a 23±2 kJ/mol free energy barrier,
reaching state B (d ⇠2.3, n ⇠2.3). The negative charge of state B is neither localized in
the NO2 fragment nor the dissociated O atom. Moreover, atom O1 has a spin density of
1.54, indicating that it is neither O– nor O (3P). This metastable state is a ”solvation cage
complex” (SCC), [NO2 · · · O]–, stabilized by hydrogen bonding with water molecules in the
first solvation shell, and characterized by the delocalization of the electron in the excited
state. Simulations with implicit solvent models cannot capture this e↵ect. The solvation
cage e↵ect was formerly hypothesized to be the cause for the low quantum yield of NO3–
photodissociation in an aqueous solution. 22 Our ab initio metadynamics simulations uncover
the molecular and electronic structure details of the SCC and support this hypothesis. The
presence of additional free energy barriers to complete NO3– dissociation suggests that the
system may remain in the SCC state for a long enough time to enhance the probability

that the photo fragments recombine or deactivate through non-radiative processes. It is
worth noting that the N-O distance in the SCC corresponds to the crossover between the
T1 and the S0 potential energy surfaces in the gas phase (Figure 2). To undergo complete
dissociation, the system overcomes either a 16±3 kJ/mol barrier to state C (d ⇠3.6, n ⇠1.2),
which corresponds to Channel (1) (NO2 + O–), or a 7±2 kJ/mol barrier to state D (d ⇠4.0,
n ⇠3.5), which corresponds to Channel (2) (NO2– + O (3P)). Bader charge analysis of the
products allows us to discriminate the two channels unequivocally, as both in states C and
D the excess negative charge is localized on either the NO2 or the O fragment (Table 3).

We note that the free energy barrier from the SCC to NO2 + O– is about twice as high
as the barrier from the SCC to NO2– + O (3P) (Table S3). This di↵erence is related to
the rearrangement of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in the first solvation shell of the SCC. To
ascertain the molecular origin of the features of the FES of dissociation, we have run a set
of unbiased trajectories starting from the transition state between states A (T1 NO3– ) and
B (SCC) (Figure S4). In two of these trajectories (labeled 5 and 6), the system remains in
the SCC basin and eventually evolves to form NO2 +O– [Channel (1)]. In two other trajectories (7 and 8) the system remains in the SCC basin for a shorter time eventually forming
NO2– +O (3P) [Channel (2)]. Examining the features of the first solvation shell in these two
di↵erent cases, we observe that dissociation along Channel (1) involves a substantial reconfiguration of the H-bonds around the two fragments - NO2 and O–. The average number of

unbiased trajectories 5 and 8 are shown in Figure S4. The blue, orange, and green curves
correspond to d, n of the NO2 fragment, and n of the dissociated O atom, respectively. The
shaded region indicates the SCC metastable state.
H-bonds around NO2 drops from 3.5 to 1.5, whereas the dissociating oxygen increases its
coordination with the surrounding water molecules from 1.5 to 2.5 (Figure 5). Conversely,
in the trajectory that probes Channel (2) the average number of H-bonds between water
and the two fragments - NO2– +O (3P) - does not vary significantly (Figure 5). The different H-bonds rearrangements involved in the two channels account for the longer resident
times in the SCC for the unbiased trajectories that evolve along Channel (1) and correlate
qualitatively with the higher free energy barrier. It can also qualitatively explain the different temperature dependence of the two channels observed in experiments, indicating that
Channel (1) becomes more favorable at high temperatures. 27
Quantum Yield Calculations
We employ a master equation five-state model to estimate the quantum yields of both channels after NO3– is excited to the T1 state. The five states comprise the four basins identified
20
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-lrx59 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2150-4182 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

in the T1 FES and the S0 ground state of NO3– . Quantum yield is experimentally defined as
the fraction of dissociation products over the absorbed photons. 12,15 In this case, we define it
as the fraction of NO3– in the T1 state that dissociates into NO2 or NO2– normalized by the
ratio of the calculated molar absorptivity to the T1 state to the total molar absorptivity at
313 nm from Figure 3, which is ⇠ 0.043. Using transition state theory, 96 we estimate the rate
constants from the free energy barriers in Table S3. Additionally, we compute non-radiative
rates for intersystem crossings from states A (T1 NO3– ) and B (SCC) to the S0 ground state
using Fermi’s golden rule combined with the path integral approach (see section S6). 86–88 We
also assume that once NO3– fully dissociates into NO2 and NO2– the transition is irreversible,
as the fragments will undergo further secondary reactions. The transition rate constants are
summarized in Table S5. It is worth noting that starting from NO3– in the excited T1 state
the transition to the SCC is about 1000 times faster than the de-excitation to the ground
state. However, the T1 -S0 intersystem crossing in the SCC is much more favorable and the
deactivation rate is faster than the transition rates to complete dissociation along either
Channel (1) or (2). Indeed, the SCC geometry conforms to a minimum energy crossing
point between the S0 and T1 potential energy surfaces of NO3– both in the gas phase and in
an implicit solvent model (see details of these calculations in SI, Section S6). Under these
circumstances, the electronic spin-orbit coupling between the T1 and S0 states at the SCC
geometry becomes much more significant resulting in a high intersystem crossing rate.
Given the large uncertainties in the calculation of the free energy barriers, we can only
predict a range for the photolysis quantum yields, namely 0.01-0.04% for Channel (1) and
0.23-1.25% for Channel (2). The estimated averages are 0.02% and 0.57%, respectively.
According to experiments, the two channels in an aqueous solution have similar quantum
yields (⇠ 1%) at room temperature, as the free energy barriers of the two channels are both
⇠ 11 ± 1 kJ/mol at 300 K. 15,31 Whereas our estimate for the range of the quantum yield for
Channel (2) is compatible with experiments, for Channel (1) it is largely underestimated.
Besides the uncertainties on the free energy barriers, due to the limited sampling time, a

possible reason lies in inaccuracies related to the chosen DFT hybrid functional and the lack
of nuclear quantum e↵ects. Previous studies suggest that these two e↵ects combined may
lead to an overestimate of the melting point of water between 15 and 20 K. 65 Hence, our
model may be considered representative of a solution at about 10 K above the melting point,
where the quantum yield for Channel (2) is much larger than for Channel (1). 31 Another
possible reason is that NO3– excitations in the S1 state may also feed Channel (1) through a
molecular mechanism similar to that explored in our metadynamics simulations. However,
we currently do not have the modeling tools to verify this hypothesis.

Conclusions
Our simulations provide atomistic insights into NO3– photolysis in aqueous solution. We
have shown that this environmentally significant reaction can occur on the triplet potential energy surface producing either nitrite or NO2 . This process can be initiated by the
direct spin-forbidden transition from the ground state (S0 ) to the first triplet state (T1 ).
Although the transition is ⇠15 times weaker than the spin-allowed transition, this pathway
is practically significant when the majority of NO3– (S1 ) is deactivated non radiatively. 35 We
also calculated the UV-visible absorption spectra for the two transitions and compared them
with the experimental spectrum. The calculated spectra show that the peak for the S0 !
T1 transition is hidden within the experimental broad peak. This opens the door for further
experimental studies for this direct spin-forbidden excitation.
For the dissociation dynamics after the photoexcitation, we have shown that the necessity
of using hybrid density functional to simulate NO3– photolysis in an aqueous solution and the
capability of multiple walkers well-tempered metadynamics to model its reaction dynamics
with explicit solvent molecules at the T1 state. Both photodissociation channels are observed,
and a SCC is identified. This metastable SCC extends the present picture of the solvation
cage e↵ect in the community from a microscopic perspective, allowing for an illustration of

how the photo fragments can recombine before escaping from the solvation cage. We also
estimate the triplet state quantum yields of the two channels with a master equation model.
The results agree qualitatively with experiments in which Channel (2) dominates at a lower
temperature. Further investigations on S1 state dynamics, non-adiabatic interactions, and
transitions among electronic states with explicit solvents will help complete the complex
picture of NO3– photolysis.
The current research provides an example of modeling photochemistry in a bulk aqueous
solution, which can provide insight into how photolysis occurs in di↵erent pathways. We
show that it is necessary to explicitly model the solvation environment with a reliable electronic structure method to explore di↵erent chemical reaction pathways. We find that the
rearrangement of H-bonds is necessary to illustrate the temperature dependence of the two
channels of NO3– photolysis under solvation environments, which cannot be observed using
an implicit solvent model. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of NO3– photolysis under
environmental conditions, the current modeling method will be transferred and adapted to
investigate NO3– photolysis at di↵erent environmental surfaces, such as the air-ice interface,
and metal oxides. 30,97

S1: Quantum Chemical Calculations in the Gas Phase and Under
Implicit Solvation
The vertical excitation energies of gas phase NO3– at its equilibrium geometry are calculated at the level
of QD-NEVPT2(10,9)/aug-cc-pVTZ and MRCI+Q(10,9)/aug-cc-pVTZ. The energies of neutral NO3 are
calculated at the level of QD-NEVPT2(9,9)/aug-cc-pVTZ and MRCI+Q(9,9)/aug-cc-pVTZ. The electron
detachment energies are calculated by the di↵erence between the ground state of neutral NO3 and the ground
state of NO3–.
We also performed potential energy surface scans on the ground state and the T1 states at the level
of DFT with implicit solvent models. For the ground state, broken-symmetry DFT was used to optimize
the structures. For the T1 state, the energies were calculated on the ground state structures with an
unrestricted Kohn-Sham reference. The solvation model based on density (SMD) of water was used as
the implicit solvation model. All these calculations were calculated using the revPBE0 functional with D3
dispersion correction with zero-damping and def2-SVP basis set.

S2: Electronic Properties of NH4 NO3 Solution
To illustrate the necessity of using hybrid density functional instead of semi-local density functional when
performing AIMD simulations at the T1 state, the projected density of states (PDOS) of NO3– and water in
the NH4 NO3 solution were calculated and shown in Figure S2. All PDOS were calculated by extracting 200
frames from a preliminary AIMD simulation at the level of a semi-local density functional with dispersion
correction (PBE-D3), followed by single point calculations for the energy levels at the S0 and T1 state with
PBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3, respectively. A previous study has shown that the electronic properties of NaCl
and Cl aqueous solution do not change significantly, regardless of the method of the AIMD simulations.
[1] For the case of PBE-D3, as shown in Figure S2a, when the system is vertically excited from S0 to T1 ,
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the system, i.e. the unpaired electron of NO3– is excited
near to the edge of the water conduction band. This causes the electron to be delocalized to the water
molecules and spontaneous dissociation of NO3– along the channel (1). Conversely, as shown in Figure S2b,
the direct spin-forbidden excitation at the level of revPBE0-D3 excites the unpaired electron to the middle
of the water band gap. The unpaired electron remains localized in NO3–, so channel (2) becomes viable in
the AIMD simulations. The results above suggest that the substrate and its solvation environment must be
accurately modeled to simulate the physics and chemistry of the system of interest. In the current study,
hybrid density functional is a more appropriate approach to model the reaction dynamics at its excited state
despite its high computational cost.

S6: Computational Details on the Master Equation Model
We emploed a master equation model to estimate the quantum yields of both channels after NO3– being
excited to the T1 state. The transition probability matrix (W) of our master equation model consisted of
the rate constants of the dissociation processes on the T1 state free energy surface and the non-radiative
deactivation processes:

Where the subscripts correspond to the transitions between two states. State 0 corresponds to NO3–
(S0 ). States A, B, C, and D correspond to the 4 meta-stable states on the free energy surface in Figure 4.
For example, kA0 corresponds to the intersystem crossing rate constant from NO3– (T1 ) to NO3– (S0 ). The
initial population is fully occupied with state A (NO3– (T1 )) with a value of 0.043 under the assumption of
NO3– absorbing photons at a wavelength of 313 nm. The population is propagated by W, and the master
equations are integrated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Here, we assume no recombinations will
occur once state C or D is reached from state B.
Two kinds of rate constants are present in W: the rate constants of transitions between the free energy
minima and the intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants. We apply the simple transition state theory[2]
to estimate the rate constants on the free energy surface:
kT ST = ⌫ exp (

F
)
kB T

Where F is the free energy barrier of the transition, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature. ⌫ is the N-O1 vibrational frequency in states A and B, which is obtained by examining the
vibrational density of states through the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function. The
obtained N-O1 stretching frequencies in states A and B are 36 and 3.9 THz, respectively. These rate
constants are multiplied with a factor of 3 to consider all three N-O bonds in NO3–.
To assess the non-radiative deactivation rates, we calculated the ISC rate constant from NO3– (T1 ) to
NO3– (S0 ) and the ISC rate constant from the solvation cage complex (SCC) at the T1 state to the S0 state
by the recently developed method using Fermi’s golden rule combined with the path integral approach. [3, 4]
This method includes the coupling of electronic spin-orbit coupling with vibrational degrees of freedom,
which can describe the ISC rates of small organic molecules with negligible electronic spin-orbit coupling.

The first term on the right-hand side is the electronic spin-orbit coupling matrix element, which is the socalled Franck-Condon (FC) approximation. The second term on the right-hand side is the vibronic spin-orbit
interaction, which is similar to the so-called Herzberg-Teller (HT) e↵ect on the electronic transition dipoles
coupled with normal coordinates. A recent benchmark study showed that this method can qualitatively
estimate the ISC rates of small organic aromatic molecules. [6]

All ISC rate calculations were performed at the level of TD-DFT with CAM-B3LYP functional and madef2-TZVP basis set using the ESD module in ORCA 5.0.4. The spin-orbit coupling operator was calculated
by specifying the ”SOCFlags = 1,4,3,0” option. The previous benchmark study showed that this is the
lowest level of approximation to provide reliable results on ISC rates. [6] Other settings were set as default,
and HT e↵ect and Duschinsky rotations were included in the calculations. [7] Estimating the ISC rate
using the method mentioned above requires one to calculate the Hessian matrices of the minima of the T1
and the S0 states. However, the Hessian matrices of the minima are not strictly available for structures
under explicit solvation at a finite temperature, as the matrices contain imaginary frequencies. Performing
geometry optimization on configurations with explicit solvation will cause the dynamic information of the
solvated system to be lost. Under this circumstance, the Hessian matrices were obtained in three ways:
1 The Hessian matrices were obtained by the geometry optimizations followed by frequency calculations
of the two structures in the gas phase.
2 The Hessian matrices were obtained by the geometry optimizations followed by frequency calculations
of the two structures under the CPCM implicit solvation model.
3 The Hessian matrices were obtained from the frequency calculations of the free energy minima from
the AIMD simulations. A hybrid solvation scheme was used with the first two solvation shells (12
water molecules) and the implicit CPCM solvation model. The imaginary frequencies were removed.
For the ISC rate from NO3–(T1 ) to NO3–(S0 ), the structure of NO3–(T1 ) was optimized at the level of TD-DFT
with CAM-B3LYP functional and ma-def2-TZVP basis set, and the structure of NO3–(S0 ) was optimized at
the level of DFT with the same functional and basis set for methods 1 and 2. Method 3 was not used to
obtain the Hessian matrices in this case since the equilibrium configurations between NO3–(T1 ) and NO3–(S0 )
under explicit solvation are more displaced from each other, the harmonic approximation in this case may
fail.
For the ISC rate from the SCC(T1 ) to the SCC(S0 ), the configuration of [NO2 · · · O]–without explicit
solvation in state B on the free energy surface was optimized in the gas phase and under the CPCM implicit
solvation model for methods 1 and 2, which leads to the minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between
the T1 and S0 states. For method 3, the configuration in state B with the first two solvation shells on the free
energy surface was directly used for both states. The frequency calculations in all these three methods were
performed at the level of broken-symmetry DFT with CAM-B3LYP functional and ma-def2-TZVP basis set.
For both transitions, the ISC rate was calculated as the weighted average of the ISC rates from the three
triplet spin sublevels, where the weight of each triplet sublevel was determined by its relative Boltzmann
population at 300 K:

Where kISC
is the ISC rate constant from the first sublevel of T1 state to S0 state and E1,2 is the
energy di↵erence between the first and second sublevels of T1 state. The ISC rates for both transitions and
their respective FC and HT contributions are summarized in Table S4. For the ISC rate from NO3–(T1 ) to
NO3–(S0 ), it is about 50 times lower under the implicit solvation model than the gas-phase (Table S4). We
note that the HT contribution for this ISC rate is 100%, which indicates that the ISC rate from NO3–(T1 )
to NO3–(S0 ) is entirely allowed by the vibronic spin-orbit coupling interaction. This also suggests that the
quality of the Hessian matrices between the two states is crucial to obtaining a reliable estimate of the ISC
rate. Therefore, this rationalizes not to apply method 3 to calculate the Hessians of the two states. Under
these circumstances, the ISC rate calculated from method 2 was used for the master equation model to
describe the ISC from NO3–(T1 ) to NO3–(S0 ).
For the ISC rate from the SCC(T1 ) to the SCC(S0 ), the three methods show the same order of magnitude
(Table S4). We note that the HT contribution for this ISC rate has a maximum of ⇠10%, which indicates
that the ISC rate from the SCC(T1 ) to the SCC(S0 ) is mainly contributed by the electronic spin-orbit
coupling. Since the HT contribution is low in this case, the error contributed by the Hessian matrices in
method 3 is acceptable. The reason for the ISC rate from the SCC(T1 ) to the SCC(S0 ) being much faster
than the case of intact NO3– may be due to the nature of the SCC, which is an ensemble of MECPs between

the one calculated with MECP optimization under the implicit solvation model (method 2). Therefore, the
ISC rate calculated from method 3 was used for the master equation model to describe the ISC from the
SCC(T1 ) to the SCC(S0 ).
