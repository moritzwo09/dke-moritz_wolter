Abstract Lithium (Li) is the lowest density metal, and therefore an optimal element in most battery
designs1,2. With the increasing demand for Li, metallurgical techniques using excess acid leaching
of mineral ores are common. However, these techniques are limited by complex, multi-step
processes with adverse environmental impacts caused by secondary waste streams1,3. Here, we
show that flash Joule heating (FJH) can convert the earth-abundant Li ore, a-spodumene, into bspodumene in seconds, making LiCl extractable with 1 M HCl (Method A). Even more simply, we

show that a one-step FJH of a-spodumene under an atmosphere of Cl2 (FJH-Cl2) can afford highpurity and high-yield LiCl in seconds without any acid treatment (Method B). This capitalizes
upon the lower DGform of the LiCl over the competing aluminum and silicon chlorides. Spodumene
undergoes the FJH-Cl2 reaction at 1550 °C in seconds, whereupon LiCl immediately distills from
the remaining non-volatile aluminum oxide and silicon oxide. LiCl with a 96% purity and 94%
yield can be achieved in this rapid one-step process, enormously reducing costs and waste
emissions. Local processing with FJH-Cl2 can dramatically lessen the complexity and cost in
obtaining Li, obviating remote mining, and facilitating the world’s progression toward cleaner
renewable energies2,3.

Introduction
Li is an essential component in lithium-ion and lithium-metal batteries, which account for
most portable renewable energy storage systems, and the drivers of the ubiquitous internet of
things and electric vehicles1,2. This has led to a global surge in Li demand4. The supply of Li,
however, is confronted with obstacles, including a lack of raw materials, the need for remote
mining, environmental concerns, and the complexity of Li extraction and separation1,3. Efficient
separation of Li is crucial to prevent supply chain disruptions and to minimize secondary waste
streams, while economically incentivizing the mining industry5,6. Primary natural sources of Li are
in brine deposits and mineral ores7-9. Two thirds of Li that is processed worldwide is extracted
from brines even though the separation process is slow, and brines have low Li concentrations of

only 1 to 2 wt%. This also requires extensive leaching and months- or years-long evaporation times
in ponds that require massive land areas9,10. Conversely, Li ores such as spodumene, lithium
aluminum inosilicate, LiAl(SiO₃)₂, have double the Li content of brines, reaching ~4 wt% of the
complex, and ~8 wt% of the total metal content in the ore. However, only one third of Li that is
obtained worldwide is extracted from spodumene because of the increased complexity in isolation
using this ore instead of brines8,11-13. Many wet strategies, including froth flotation14-16, sulfation1721

, chlorination22, 23, carbonation11,24,25, and fluorination roasting26,27, have been used to separate Li

from spodumene. Among them, the sulfation process has been the standard method for Li
separation from mineral ores including spodumene, but sulfation requires extended heating cycles
up to 1,100 °C, excess sulfuric acid, and several chemical additives, while generating cumbersome
secondary waste streams17-21.
Flash Joule heating (FJH) is an ultrafast, controllable, and energy-efficient method that has
been used for materials synthesis28-30, waste upcycling31-33, and recovery of metals34,35. We show
here that FJH allows spodumene to be converted from its α-phase to its β-phase in high yield in
seconds, and LiCl separation can ensue using only 1 M HCl (Method A). However, this method
still requires the use of dilute acid. Conversely, we can combine FJH with a gas chlorination
process (FJH-Cl2) as an alternative method of Li separation (Method B). FJH-Cl2 requires no
secondary acid for LiCl separation, and it reduces the processing time to seconds from the days
needed in sulfation, and months or more needed when processing Li brines.

Arc welder FJH apparatus
Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram of the FJH-Cl2 reaction apparatus. A quartz tube serves
as the reaction chamber, while two graphite rods are attached to graphite blocks on either end of a
sheet of carbon paper. When chlorine gas (Cl2) enters the chamber, Li from the spodumene reacts
with the Cl2 to form volatile LiCl that condenses on the inner wall of the quartz tube. The unreacted
silicon oxide (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) in the spodumene remain in the residue on the
carbon paper, thereby achieving the Li separation. LiCl in the volatile phase can be recovered by
rinsing the quartz tube with water. The commercial arc welder used to power this system costs
only $125 (Supplementary Fig. S1) and has a maximum power output of 5.8 kW, providing a rapid
and stable electrical heat source for the reaction.
The first advantage of this setup is temperature controllability, achieved by adjusting the
current setting on the arc welder dial (Fig. 1b). The temperature profile of the carbon paper was
measured using an infrared thermometer, where the temperature was ~1150 °C at a current output
setting of 10, and ~1630 ºC at a current setting of 20. The second advantage of this system is
temperature uniformity. The surface of the heated carbon paper displays a uniform orange-red
color, confirming a uniform temperature induced by FJH across the carbon paper as verified with
an infrared thermometer (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. S2). The third advantage is temperature
stability. When the current setting is 15, the output current remains steady during the spodumene
treatment with Cl2. The surface temperature of the carbon paper remains at 1420 ºC for the duration
of the reaction, emphasizing the temperature stability of this apparatus (Fig. 1d).

Conversion of a-spodumene to b-spodumene
Spodumene exists in different crystalline phases, typically in its natural α-phase or rock form
(Fig. 2a). Before the FJH process, the spodumene rock was ground into micron-sized powder using
a mortar and pestle and then sieved through successive meshes with pore sizes of 1000 µm, 200
µm, and 53 µm to obtain particles of corresponding sizes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

images show these particles as uniformly sized but irregularly shaped (Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Fig. S3). When spodumene particles are subjected to FJH, the α-phase converts to the β-phase.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the two phases are clearly different (Fig. 2b and
Supplementary Fig. S4)36. However, the phase transformation varies with different particle sizes.
When using 30 s of FJH at 1150 ºC, signals of the α-phase are still detected in the FJH-treated 200
µm spodumene. There is a strong signal peak at 21.1º, 30.5º, and 32.0º in the XRD pattern,
indicating an incomplete phase conversion (Supplementary Fig. S4). Under the same treatment
parameters for the 53 µm sample, only the β-phase signal can be found after treatment by FJH (Fig.
2b), revealing that smaller particles are necessary to achieve a complete phase transformation.
Raman spectroscopy further illustrates that the untreated α-phase exhibits typical Raman peaks
~370 cm-1 and 700 cm-1. The samples treated by FJH only show the characteristic Raman peak of
the β-phase at ~500 cm-1 (Fig. 2c)37, 38. However, using FJH in conjunction with decreasing particle
size has a greater effect on improving the LiCl yield than the purity. When the spodumene size is
1000 µm, the yield was improved from 16.3% to 36.8% after FJH, while using 53 µm particles
increased the yield from 57% before FJH to 92% after FJH (Fig. 2d). The results of the HCl
washing of the LiCl from this phase-converted sample (Method A, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Fig.
S7) are described in the Supplementary Text S1.

FJH-Cl2 of spodumene
Rapid FJH can achieve the formation of β-spodumene, which is necessary to increase the
efficiency of Li extraction. However, this cannot eliminate the use of acid, nor does it overcome
the limitations in purity of Li. Therefore, exploring the chemical reactivity of different elements in

spodumene is necessary to achieve efficient Li separation. Inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) results show that the main elements in the purchased spodumene rock are
Li, Al, and Si (Fig. 3a). This is consistent with scanning electron microscopy with energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) (Supplementary Fig. S8) and XPS (Supplementary
Fig. S9) results, where the Li content is 4.8%. We conducted a thermodynamic analysis for
chlorinating silicon oxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and lithium oxide (Li2O) in αspodumene. According to the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) vs. temperature, only Li2O is
chlorinated below 2000 ºC, and chlorination is unfeasible for SiO2 and Al2O3 within that
temperature range (Fig. 3b). ΔG is negative for Li2O when the temperature is higher than 514 ºC,
suggesting that Li in spodumene can be chlorinated at ~514 ºC. However, when the chlorination
reaction occurs between 514 °C and the boiling point of LiCl (1382 °C), leaching the formed LiCl
with water results in low purity and yield of Li due to the interference of Si impurities in the sample
(Supplementary Fig. S10). However, when the control temperature is above the boiling point of
LiCl, and below 2000 ºC, LiCl can be cleanly volatilized and separated from spodumene (Method
B, Supplementary Fig. S5).
When the arc welder settings are 15 and 18, the corresponding temperatures are 1420 ºC and
1550 ºC, respectively. After 30 s of chlorinating spodumene, volatile LiCl deposits on the inner
surface of the quartz tube (Fig. 3c). SEM-EDX characterization results indicate that the primary
element in the volatile fraction is Cl, with trace amounts of Si and Al (Supplementary Fig. 11a);
Li is too light to be detected. XPS results also show that the main elements in the volatile fraction

are Cl, O, and Li (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c). After the chlorination reaction, a significant amount
of residue remains on the carbon paper. SEM-EDX results reveal that the main elements in the
residue are Si, Al, O, and Cl (Supplementary Fig. 12a), which is consistent with the XPS results
(Supplementary Fig. 12b). By comparing the XPS fine spectra of Li in the original spodumene
sample with the residue, there is no detectable Li signal in the residue after FJH-Cl2 (Fig. 3d). This
result suggests that the FJH-Cl2 reaction can selectively and efficiently separate Li as LiCl directly
from raw spodumene.
High-temperature vapor-phase reactions can inevitably introduce SiO2 and Al2O3 into the
volatile phase via physical mass transport processes during the rapid LiCl volatilization; in an
industrialized process, further fractionation plates would be desired. Interestingly, ICP-MS results
show that purity can be enhanced when the volatile obtained from the chlorination reaction is
rinsed with water (Fig. 3e). LiCl is water-soluble while SiO2 and Al2O3 are not, so the water-wash
acts as an additional purification step while extracting only the condensed LiCl from the quartz
tube. Additionally, as the particle size of spodumene decreases, the purity of Li increases. When
the particle size of spodumene is 53 µm, the purity of Li obtained from FJH-Cl2 can reach 95%
(Fig. 3e). Furthermore, the yield of LiCl is related to the particle size of the sample and the
chlorination temperature. When the particle size is 200 µm and the arc welder setting is 15 (1420
ºC), the purity of Li obtained from the FJH-Cl2 is 88%, but the yield is only 41% (Fig. 3f). Even
when the particle size is 53 µm, the yield is still only 64%. However, when the current dial is set
to 18 (1550 ºC), and 53 µm spodumene particles are used, extracted LiCl with 96% purity and 94%

yield can be obtained (Fig. 3f). Hence, when the temperature is set to 1550 °C, the LiCl rapidly
forms (~512 °C) and distills from the mixture since the LiCl boiling point is 1382 °C. Other sources
of spodumene ore were used to ensure that the process worked equally well regardless of the region
from which the sample was mined (Supplementary Text S2, Fig. S13 and Fig. S14).
Although the Li process here was only on a laboratory scale, FJH has recently been
demonstrated on the 1-tonne day-1 production scale for the conversion of inexpensive coal or coke
into graphene at ~3000 °C,40 a temperature nearly twice that needed for LiCl separation. Hence,
these approaches can be scaled, thereby serving as a harbinger for the commercializing of this Li
separation process.

Density Functional Theory Calculations
To understand why the chlorination method can so efficiently and quickly separate Li from
spodumene, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to further explore the
mechanism of this process. The energy required to separate 50% and 100% of the Li from both αspodumene and β-spodumene between 1600 K and 2000 K and at 1, 6, and 11 atm was calculated
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 15 and 16). Generally, natural spodumene is in the α-phase, which is
monoclinic (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 15a), after extracting all the Li, the structure is
different from the α-phase spodumene but still stable (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 15b). When
increasing the temperature from 1600 K to 2000 K and decreasing the pressure from 11 atm to 1
atm, the chlorination for extracting Li from α-phase spodumene requires less energy (Fig. 4c).
During the FJH process, the spodumene readily converts from the monoclinic α-phase to the
tetragonal β-phase (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 15c). After extracting the Li from β-phase

11

spodumene, the structure frame (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 15d) is totally different from that
of α-phase spodumene. More importantly, delithiation from the β-phase spodumene requires less
energy under the same temperature and pressure than the α-phase. Full delithiation energy from βphase spodumene is by 0.15 eV/Li lower than that of α-phase spodumene (Fig. 4f), and by 0.26
eV/Li lower than α-phase spodumene for half delithiation (Supplementary Fig. S16). These results
show that delithiation of β-phase spodumene is significantly more exothermic and therefore more
favorable than α-phase spodumene. This indicates that during the FJH-Cl2 process, spodumene
first converts from the α-phase to the β-phase before reacting with Cl2 allowing for a lower- energy
Li separation process.

LCA, TEA, and environmental impacts
A Monte Carlo life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) were
employed, and the details are explained in the Supplementary Text S3. The primary factors
considered were energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions of CO2 listed as global warming
potential (GWP), water and acid consumption, and processing cost (Fig. 5). These factors were
chosen since they contribute the most to materials costs, consumption, and produced waste.
Processing 1 tonne of high-grade spodumene ore produces 44 to 48 kg of Li for both methods
because similar yields are achieved in both FJH-Cl2 and sulfation processes. The LCA shows that
FJH-Cl2 can reduce the process energy consumption by 86% from 15,700 MJ to 2,200 MJ (Fig.
5a), water consumption by 67% from 373,000 kg to 125,000 kg and acid consumption by 100%
(Fig. 5d). When accounting for intercontinental transportation in the sulfation process, FJH-Cl2
can also reduce the GWP by up to 56% from 30,400 kg CO2 to 13,400 kg CO2 (Fig. 5b), and the
TEA shows a reduction in operating costs of up to 73% from $352,500 to $95,600 (Fig. 5c-d).

Conclusion
Spodumene can be converted from the α-phase to the β-phase with only 30 s of FJH. An
inexpensive arc welder can be used on a laboratory scale to facilitate this process. In Method A,
14

91% yield of the Li is extracted from spodumene using FJH and 1 M HCl. In Method B shows a
FJH-Cl2 method to separate Li with 96% purity and a 94% yield. DFT calculations indicate that
extracting Li from β-phase spodumene requires less energy, suggesting that spodumene converts
first from the α-phase to the β-phase during the chlorination. LCA and TEA confirmed that the
acid-free FJH-Cl2 method can greatly reduce the total energy consumption, capital and operating
costs, water consumption and emissions compared to the industrial standard, sulfuric acid leaching.
Capitalizing upon the differences in DGform of the LiCl vs. silicon and aluminum chlorides, these
results showcase the FJH-Cl2 method as an efficient and environmentally friendly process for Li
separation from ores. The process will likely extend into the separation of Li from spent batteries,
and other metals in electronic wastes41. This rapid Li separation method permits local Li assets to
be developed, lessening costs for renewable energy transitions.

Materials and methods
Materials. The carbon paper was purchased from FuelCellStore (Toray Carbon Paper 060). Bulk
spodumene crystals were purchased from EmpathMoonGems (Bulk Kunzite Spodumene Crystals)
which are normally sourced from one of four locations: Afghanistan, Brazil, United States or
Madagascar42. The spodumene sand was received from Australia. Both spodumene samples were
ground into micron-sized powder using a mortar and pestle and then sieved through meshes with
pore sizes of 1000 µm, 200 µm, and 53 µm to obtain particles of corresponding sizes. Nitric acid
(HNO3, 67-70 wt%, TraceMetalTM Grade, Fisher Chemical), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%,

99.99%, trace metal basis, Millipore Sigma), hydrofluoric acid (HF, 48 wt%, 99.99%, trace metal
grade for ICP analysis, Millipore Sigma), and ultrapure water (Millipore Sigma, ACS reagent for
ultra-trace analysis) were used for sample digestion. A Cl2 cylinder (Millipore Sigma, 99.5%, 85
psi, 454 g) was used to supply the Cl2. Argon gas (Airgas, 99.99%) was used to purge the system
to remove moisture and air in the reaction chamber prior to the introduction of Cl2. The arc welder
power supply used as a DEKOPRO DKUS-MMA-160A arc welder (Amazon, $120)43. The arc
welder displays a “current” setting on the screen ranging from 8-160. While the arc welder dial
settings correspond to increasing current as they are turned higher, they are not an absolute current
setting in amperes that matches with the dial setting number. The details of the FJH and FJH-Cl2
system have been described previously41.
Joule heating chlorination system. The Joule heating system comprises a power source, graphite
rod, graphite block, and carbon paper. The power source here is the commercial arc welder,
connected to the carbon paper via graphite rods and graphite blocks. The temperature of the carbon
paper was measured using a Micro-Epsilon thermometer, CTM-3SF75H2-C and CTRM1H1SF100-C3. The former tests the temperature range between 200-1500 ºC, and the latter tests
the temperature range between 1500-3000 ºC. The spodumene sample (50 mg) is spread evenly on
the surface of carbon paper in a quartz tube and sealed at the ends of the tube with electrodes, an
inlet chlorine gas line, and an outlet volatile gas line for unreacted chlorine. The quartz tube is
conventionally 2.54 cm in interior diameter and 20 cm long. The size of carbon paper is usually 2
x 6 cm, and the resistance is 0.8-1.0 Ω. Argon gas (Airgas, 99.99%) is initially introduced into the

chamber to purge the system atmosphere combined with a pumping system, and then chlorine gas
(Millipore Sigma, 99.5%) is introduced into the reaction system. Connected to the outlet of the
reaction system is a sodium hydroxide bath, which absorbs the unreacted chlorine gas.
Characterization. XRD was performed by the Rigaku SmartLab system with filtered Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were acquired using a Renishaw Raman microscope (laser
wavelength of 532 nm, laser power of 5 mW, 50 × lens). SEM images were obtained using a FEI
Quanta 400 ESEM FEG system at 20 kV. EDS spectra and maps were acquired using the same
system equipped with an EDS detector. XPS was conducted using a PHI Quantera XPS system at
a base pressure of 5 × 10-9 Torr. Elemental spectra were obtained with a step size of 0.1 eV with a
pass energy of 26 eV. All the XPS spectra were calibrated using the standard C 1s peak at 284.8
eV.
ICP-MS measurement. Total digestion is used to analyze the element content in raw spodumene.
50 mg of samples with a size of ~1000 µm diameter were dissolved in 5 mL solution of
hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%, 99.99%, trace metal basis, Millipore Sigma), nitric acid (HNO3,
67-70 wt%, TraceMetalTM Grade, Fisher Chemical), and hydrofluoric acid (HF, 48 wt%, 99.99%,
trace metal grade for ICP analysis, Millipore Sigma) with a volume ratio of 3:1:1 and placed in an
ultrasonic bath for 12 h. The leaching experiment uses 30 mg of unreacted spodumene powder and
30 mg of FJH-treated powder in 5 mL of 1 M HCl for 6 h. Here, the leaching rates of Li were
compared not only for samples with the same particle size but also for leaching temperatures at
both room temperature (22 ºC) and 90 ºC. For testing the volatile phase, the samples washed with

DI water are collected first, and then the supernatant is dissolved in 2 wt % dilute HNO3, which is
then diluted to target concentrations for ICP-MS testing. The Periodic Table mix 1 (Millipore
Sigma, 33 elements of Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, B, Ca, Cd, Cs, Cr, Co, Cu, Ga, In, Fe, Pb, Li, Mg, Mn,
Ni, P, K, Rb, Se, Si, Ag, Na, Sr, S, Te, Tl, V, and Zn, 10 mg L−1 each, in 10 wt % HNO3 containing
HF traces) and Periodic Table mix 2 (Millipore Sigma, 17 elements of Au, Ge, Hf, Ir, Mo, Nb, Pd,
Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, Sb, Sn, Ta, Ti, W, and Zr, 10 mg L−1 each, in 5% HF and 1% HCl containing HNO3
traces) were used as the standard solution.
DFT computational methods.
We perform density-functional-theory (DFT)44 modeling of FJH-Cl2 delithiation of
spodumene (LiAlSi2O6) as expressed in the following reaction:
LiAlSi2O6 + (x/2) Cl2 = x LiCl + Li(1-x)AlSi2O6,

(1)

Where x = 0.5 and 1.0, respectively, for 50% and 100% of Li atoms being extracted out of
spodumene. The Gibbs free energy (formation energy) of the reaction can be calculated following
the equation:
0

𝐺 = [𝐸!"#$%&'( − 𝐸")*&'*+'( + 𝑥𝜇,-./ − )1* 𝜇./! ]/𝑥,

(2)

where 𝐸!"#$%&'( and 𝐸")*&'*+'( are the DFT total energy of all products and reactants according
to their chemical formula and stoichiometric ratio, and 𝜇./! and 𝜇,-./ are the chemical potentials
of Cl2 and LiCl in gas phase. The chemical potential of Cl2 gas as a function of pressure p and
temperature T can be calculated following the equation45:
𝜇./! (𝑇, 𝑝) = 𝐻(𝑇, 𝑝2 ) − 𝐻(0𝐾, 𝑝2 ) − 𝑇[𝑆(𝑇, 𝑝2 ) − 𝑆(0𝐾, 𝑝2 )] + 𝑘𝑇𝑙𝑛(𝑝⁄𝑝2 ),

where the 𝑝2 = 1𝑎𝑡𝑚 , and the entropy 𝑆(𝑇, 𝑝2 ) , enthalpy 𝐻(𝑇, 𝑝2 ) are taken from the
thermochemical tables46. For LiCl, the same method is used.
DFT methods are used as they are implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation
Package (VASP)47. A plane wave expansion up to 520 eV is employed in combination with an allelectron-like projector augmented wave (PAW) potential48. Exchange-correlation is treated within
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the functional parameterized by PerdewBurke-Ernserhof49. Periodic condition is applied to the supercell or unit cell of crystal structures,
with Brillouin zone integration converges over Monkhorst-Pack type mesh50. In structure
optimization using the conjugate-gradient algorithm as implemented in VASP, both the positions
of atoms and the size of unit cells are fully relaxed so that the maximum force on each atom is
smaller than 0.01 eV/Å.
The α- and β-spodumene were modeled in supercells each having 4 Li atoms, 4 Al atoms,
8 Si atom, and 24 O atoms. We found that the overall frameworks of α- and β-spodumene remain
to be stable except for slight deformation (see Figs. 2 and 3, and the details of structural coordinates
can be found in the data uploaded related to this paper). For the partially delithiated spodumene
Li(1-x)AlSi2O6 (x = 0.5), we search the most energetically favorable structure in all possible
configurations in which two of the four Li atoms in the original spodumene were removed. The
LiCl has an FCC crystal structure with lattice constant of a = 2.574 Å and the Cl2 molecule is
optimized inside a vacuum box of 20 Å × 20 Å × 20 Å.

LCA and TEA. The TEA and LCA were performed using the OpenLCA software51. Monte-Carlo
simulations were performed for both processes with 10,000 iterations at a 95% confidence interval
for all variables to assess the necessary inputs to produce 1 tonne of Li from the FJH-Cl2 and
industrial sulfation processes. The data used to simulate the industrial spodumene treatment
process was collected from the literature to compare with experimental variables for the FJH-Cl2
process. Data analysis from the Monte-Carlo simulations was performed with Microsoft Excel and
Python to plot the histograms and radar plots.
