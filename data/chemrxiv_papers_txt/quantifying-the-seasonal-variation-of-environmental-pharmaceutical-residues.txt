Abstract
Pharmaceutical substances, among other contaminants drained from wastewater treatment process and entered into aqueous environments, exhibit significant
seasonal dependencies in their environmental concentrations. Although measurement data on removal of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater treatment plants
and their degradation in the environment thereafter are readily available, the complexity and uniqueness of the sampling scenarios makes general numerical estimation of these phenomena difficult. To gain quantitative insight on the mass balances
of environmental pharmaceutical residues and their seasonal variations, measurement data of four pharmaceuticals were collected from the literature and an effort
was undertaken to uniform them and parametrise them with as few variables as
feasible. Temperature was found to be a commonly available parameter with a
marked trendsetting effect, and the prospect of using it to characterise the variation
was examined. Ways to reliably assess the effects of dilution and other advective
phenomena on the measured concentrations were explored, and a simple method
for using cross-comparisons of different pharmaceuticals to this end is presented.
A corresponding fugacity model scenario was also constructed to provide a computational baseline for the mass balance.

Introduction

Modern industry produces and uses a growing variety of anthropogenic chemicals
which are constantly encountered in the environment all over the globe. Traces of
pharmaceutical substances are among the emerging micropollutants with a recognised
ecological impact, the possible effects ranging from chronic toxicity levels on organisms (Hughes et al., 2013) to the alteration of bacterial community compositions of
ecosystems (Hagberg et al., 2021). Various approaches to better understand the action of pharmaceuticals have been called for (Shaheen et al., 2022). These include
an improved account of the seasonal dynamics and further development of modelling
methods. For many contaminants, municipal sewage waters are a major entry route

to aquatic environments due to imperfections in trace-chemical removal at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Major differences in pharmaceutical emission levels are
observed between seasons (Vieno et al., 2005; Lindholm-Lehto et al., 2016) which accordingly indicates that the removal efficacy depends on the time of year. Knowledge
on the seasonal variations of micropollutant concentrations is important for estimating
the proportion of affected organisms (Mehdi et al., 2021) and further consequences
such as conditions at drinking water treatment plants (Azzouz and Ballesteros, 2013).
Various seasonal patterns have been recognised to stem from the source of the
contaminants. Rainfall, for instance, affects the dilution of contaminants that originate from wastewater and the amounts that are flushed from fields (Comber et al.,
2020). In case of pharmaceuticals, known examples of temporal changes in usage patterns and thus environmental concentrations range from single popular events causing
marked spikes (Lindholm-Lehto et al., 2015) to seasonal changes in complete population profiles (Vatovec et al., 2016; Mandaric et al., 2017). Temperature and sunlight
variations can affect the environmental behaviour of contaminants by photodegradation
(Wang et al., 2020a), a phenomenon that is relatively straightforward to assess based on
weather data. On the other hand, deconjugation of pharmaceutical metabolites can act
as a major contributor to observed concentrations (Azuma et al., 2017), but it is rarely
quantifiable due to analytical challenges and the lack of measurement standards. Due
to the vast amount of different environmental parameters, it is often hard to estimate
the extent to which different sources, degradation rates, and hydrological phenomena
affect the seasonal changes in contaminant levels. Rivers can be argued to be the easiest
type of aquatic environment to characterise since the main flow direction remains constant and homogeneous mixing occurs horizontally. However, even then the chemical
fate can be complicated, as demonstrated by the review by Glaser et al. (2019).
A relatively widespread approach for predicting environmental concentrations of
pharmaceuticals is presented in an European Medicines Agency’s guideline (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), 2006). The guideline provides
a simple tool for estimating surface-water concentrations of pharmaceuticals based on
local pharmaceutical usage data, wastewater flow, and dilution parameters. A more
fine-grained version of this was used by Villa et al. (2020), who included excretion
and WWTP removal efficiency parameters in the calculation. However, these methods do not include environmental degradation. To this end, we previously showed the
feasibility of an enhanced, pseudo-steady state fugacity model (FATEMOD-Q) to inspect the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals in a stratified, humic lake environment
(Nurmi et al., 2019). The FATEMOD-Q results were similar to ones produced by more
in-depth photochemical modelling (Bodrato and Vione, 2014).
The seasonal variation of environmental pharmaceutical levels has gained few accounts in the literature. For example, Comber et al. (2020) analysed a large data set
from different seasons and Sun et al. (2019) inspected the fate of antibiotics in an icecovered river. To our knowledge, no significant emphasis has been put on a quantitative
assessment that aims to generalise the extent of the seasonal variation. To provide insight and numerical tools into this topic, we analyse the literature data for general trends
of seasonal dependency in a collection of WWTP removal efficiencies and pharmaceutical concentrations in the environment. This is augmented by degradation assessment
via environmental fate modelling, and the correspondence of its results with the litera2

ture data is discussed. We communicate the analysis in a chronological order from the
source WWTP process to emission levels in aquatic environments, and finally present
the FATEMOD-Q modelling results for comparison. The applied methods and model
are shown to help understand the temporal behaviour of contaminants on seasonal and
also shorter timescales.

Materials and methods

2.1

Target molecules

Three pharmaceuticals from the previous research (Nurmi et al., 2019) were selected
for the present work: anti-inflammatories ibuprofen (IBU) and diclofenac (DCF), and
the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ). In addition, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole
(SMX), which is frequently detected in the environment (Krzeminski et al., 2019), was
investigated. Measurements of 164 different contaminants by Golovko et al. (2021)
have demonstrated the vast amount of different pollutants emerging in aquatic environment. Molnar et al. (2020) have calculated toxicities of mixtures taking into account
the known transformation products, which are manifold as demonstrated by Lin et al.
(2019). To include a transformation product also in this work, 4-isobutylacetophenone
(IBAP) was added to our modelling environment since it has exhibited notable levels
in measurements (Zorita et al., 2007) and modelling (Ruggeri et al., 2013). The five
compounds’ physicobiochemical properties listed in Table 1 exhibit differences which
help inspecting the effects of environmental parameters from various viewpoints.

2.2

Residue removal in WWTP

In order to limit the technological variety, we only inspected the conventional activated sludge (CAS) WWTP, which is the most ubiquitous and traditional plant type
(Krzeminski et al., 2019). The criterion for data collection from literature was that
concentrations of at least one of the target molecules had been quantified for both influents and effluents, see Online Resource Table S1 for the detailed list of the WWTPs
(Lindholm-Lehto et al., 2016; Vieno et al., 2005; Papageorgiou et al., 2016; Joss et al.,
2005; Clara et al., 2005; Česen et al., 2018; Fernández et al., 2014; Paíga et al., 2016;
Kot-Wasik et al., 2016; Conceicao et al., 2023). By this criterion we avoid possible inaccuracies caused by the limits of analytical methods. However, from the total of 130
removal results collected, nine samples had effluent concentrations between the limit of
detection and the limit of quantification. For these cases we assumed the concentration
to be half of the limit of quantification.
Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of sewage is identified as one of the factors that
determines the WWTP efficacy (Verlicchi et al., 2012). To quantify the process, we
define the removal degree as
c0 − c(τ)
,
(1)
η=
c0
where c0 is the concentration of a pharmaceutical in influent and c(τ) is the residual
concentration in effluent at time τ (h), i.e., after the HRT had passed. We note that

the methodology for sampling the influent and effluent concentrations varies from one
WWTP to another, which affects the accuracy and comparability of WWTP data. In
addition, the sampling seldom follows the same parcel of water from influent to effluent. While most of the collected values are based on single pairs of influent–effluent
samplings (Česen et al., 2018), some values are averages from sampling campaigns
spanning days (Papageorgiou et al., 2016) or from weekly samplings during a season
(Kot-Wasik et al., 2016). We use the mean values in cases where a range of concentrations in influents and effluents was given.
Metcalfe et al. (2003) have presented an exponential dependence of the removal
degree of ibuprofen and naproxen on the HRT. This suggests that the removal can
conveniently be characterised by first-order reaction rate constants

where c(τ) was taken as the reported effluent concentration at an undetermined τ. In
this form, the collected efficiencies were used to assess a specific WWTP process on
an equal footing with the rate constants of Eq. (2). We remind that the removal degree
η (as well as k and r) can be negative in cases where backward reaction has taken
place. That is, pharmaceuticals entering in a conjugated form can escape the detection
in influent samples but emerge later in effluent samples after microbial deconjugation.
In general, also the solid retention time has an effect on the WWTP efficacy (Verlicchi et al., 2012). However, for the present selection of pharmaceuticals, no significance
was found by Joss et al. (2005). Due to this controversy, solid retention times of the
WWTPs were not considered further in the present work.
Temperature, on the other hand, is another factor that clearly affects the WWTP’s
removal efficiency (Verlicchi et al., 2012). To probe the correlation between global
efficiency and temperature, we compared the rate constants of Eq. (2) with respect to
temperature for all the data with HRT available. In addition, the intra-WWTP efficiency
correlation was examined by the Eq. (3) values for each WWTP that had measurements
available at two or more temperatures. For each pharmaceutical, least-squares fitted
linear trend curves
k(T ) = k0 + k1 T ,
(4)
and equivalent for r(T ), were compiled to assess the temperature (T , ◦ C) patterns in
the data and to obtain averages for the fit parameters k0 , k1 , r0 , and r1 . Afterwards, the
intra-WWTP data were resampled to make fits to combinations of either three or four
temperatures. The combinatory test was performed in order to evaluate whether the
approach of assessing intra-WWTP temperature correlation is justified. We interpret
such test as positive if a higher correlation is found within intra-WWTP fits than within
all combinations on average.
The temperature data provided by the original researchers was used when available; otherwise, applicable weather data was searched from public resources. There
are differences in the temperature measurement protocols as some values were from
the effluent water and some were more general aerial or aqueous values at the WWTP.
However, this variation of effluent conditions is assumed of minor importance, since
intraday variation can cause larger than four-fold changes in WWTP influent’s micropollutant levels (Li et al., 2018). Moreover, the temperature differences are expected
to be relatively small. In the case of intra-WWTP r(T ) values, the comparisons are
feasible since they always share the temperature information source.

2.3

Residue degradation in aquatic environments

To assess the environmental behaviour of contaminants, hydrological features of different aquatic environments need to be taken into account (Nurmi et al., 2019). We limit
the present work to rivers and comparable environments with clearly defined hydrological character, see Online Resource Table S2 for the detailed list (Schimmelpfennig

et al., 2016; Vieno et al., 2005; Daneshvar et al., 2010a,b; Meierjohann et al., 2016;
Mandaric et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020; Barbosa et al., 2018). The criterion for data
inclusion was that concentrations were evaluated from different points of a river without WWTPs or other obvious point sources in-between. As with WWTP removals,
ideally both start and endpoint concentrations were quantifiable. This was the case for
56 results out of 59 inspected. In one case, half the limit of quantification was used, and
in two cases where sufficient concentration data were not available, removal degrees
of η = 0.999 were used. For some of the samples, retention time data for the river
water was readily available; where not, it was estimated from different sources. This
allowed to determine first-order environmental degradation rate constants similarly to
the WWTPs and Eq. (2).
Temperature is often directly correlated with sunlight that determines the photodegradation (Wang et al., 2020a), and can be argued to also affect the biodegradation that depends on both sediment properties and water stream dynamics (Radke and
Maier, 2014). Therefore, we assume that temperature is the single parameter with
widest characterisation potential, which is also justified by the analysis of Silva et al.
(2021), who identified the daily maximum temperature as a key factor in pharmaceutical transformations. The degradation rate constants are thus evaluated with respect to
temperature to examine whether trends could be revealed.
Further, we examined the usage of CBZ concentrations as a quasi-internal standard.
CBZ was one of the measured pharmaceuticals in most of the studies, its environmental
degradation is known to be very limited (Hughes et al., 2013), and the environmental
half-life is degrees of magnitude longer (Bodrato and Vione, 2014) than the timescales
inspected in this work. Therefore, the mass of CBZ is assumed to remain constant
between the inspected sampling points 0 and 1. As the CBZ mass change ∆m = 0, the
observed change in CBZ concentration, ∆c = c0 − c1 , could then be assumed to cover
hydrodynamic phenomena such that
∆c = c0 (1 − d) ,

(5)

where the environmental dilution coefficient is d = c1 /c0 . This ratio from CBZ measurement was then applied to rescale the other pharmaceuticals i measured from the

Environmental fate modelling with seasonal effects

The fugacity-based environmental fate model FATEMOD-Q was used with a unit environment illustrated as a cross section in Fig. 1. The model compartments L1, L2, and
L3 represent the water column at different layer depths, each containing a subcompartment of suspended sediments occupying 0.0036 % of the volume, and S denotes the
bottom sediments. All the water layers and the sediment were assumed homogeneous
6

internally. The surface layer L1, above the main body of water L2, mainly supported
the photolytic degradation while the biodegradation only happened in S. The variablethickness layer L3 was included for modelling of degradation in stratified lakes or other
environments where vertical mixing is not effective. The unit environment was a simplified version of our previous one (Nurmi et al., 2019), and apart from the extra layer
L3, resembled the one used by Wang et al. (2020b). In addition, model compartment
T was included to simulate sampling by a sedimentation tube. This allowed inspecting
development of pharmaceutical concentrations during a sampling period corresponding
to work by Lindholm-Lehto et al. (2015).

bottom sediment S, and sedimentation tube T
The incorporated ability of the FATEMOD-Q method to choose starting conditions between zero or Mackay-Level III equilibrium concentrations allowed to inspect
contamination changes in an environment. To assess the pure degradation of pharmaceuticals, the model environment was set closed with no advection across system
boundaries, i.e., no water flowing in or out and no sediment burial. The pharmaceuticals were set with a fixed starting mass to focus on the mass balance. This allowed to
provide a first-order degradation rate constant for a whole compartment cross-section.
We extended the method to include a Mackay-Level IV type temporal modelling
(Mackay, 2001). For temporal modelling, the water mass was set to flow through the
model area at a speed of 1 m/s typical to rivers. To adapt the lake model environment
to characterise river conditions, intercompartmental vertical mixing velocities were set
to 5 cm2 /s between L1 and L2, and 1 cm2 /s between L2 and L3. These correspond to
complete mixing durations of 1.4 h and 320 h for L1–L2 and L2–L3, respectively. The
vertical dimension of the L3 compartment was varied from 0 to 8 m to gain general
information on the effect of less mixed deep layers.
Environmental degradation rates for the four pharmaceuticals were modelled by
adding a 1.0 g mass of each in the model compartment L2, which we intend to represent a WWTP effluent location, and observing the half-life. To assess if the length of
the half-life outweighs the effect of intra-environment mixing, setting the mass in L1
and L3 was also tested for DCF. The preliminary results showed that the effect is relatively small: the resulting final concentrations were < 20 % lower when pharmaceutical
mass was set in L3 and ca. 1 % lower when in L1. Additionally, when inspecting the
sedimentation tube concentration profile, water was set to flow through the area at the

speed of 0.1 m/s and to contain 50 ng/l of both DCF and CBZ.
Photo- and biodegradation half-lives for the target molecules are listed in Table 1.
For IBU and DCF, the values were set identical to the previous work (Nurmi et al.,
2019). IBAP, the photoproduct of IBU (Zorita et al., 2007), was included to exemplify
assessment of transformation products without measurement data available. A wide
variety of photodegradation half-lives in simulated or authentic natural waters has been
reported for CBZ, ranging from 6 h (Lam and Mabury, 2005) to ca. 900 h (Andreozzi
et al., 2002). However, since the latter has been suggested to be affected by glass vessel
UV filtering (Matamoros et al., 2009), we selected a shorter half-life of 100 h for this
work. Biodegradation is not likely to have a notable role for CBZ at the timescales
inspected (Li et al., 2013), and was thus not included in the model. SMX was set
to have photodegradation reactions with a 6 h half-life (Lam and Mabury, 2005) and
biodegradation reactions were set up based on a half-life of 300 h (Xu et al., 2011).
Each model compartment was set to have the same temperature, which was then
varied in the typical environmental temperature range. The environmental temperature
in experiments by Wang et al. (2020b) ranged from 12 ◦ C to 28 ◦ C, and the obtained
photodegradation rate constants were on average ca. 1.5–2 times higher during the
higher end of temperature. Thus, to roughly characterise the temperature dependence,
we multiplied the L1 photodegradation rate constants by (1.5T + 5)/100, where T is
the compartment temperature in ◦ C. In case of ice cover, the photodegradation would
evidently be nonexistent. For a comprehensive list of the model parameters, see Online
Resource Table S3.

Results and discussion

3.1

Evaluation of seasonal WWTP efficiencies

The WWTP data (summarised in Online Resources) was analysed in two ways. First,
removal rate constants from the data with HRT available are plotted against the measurement temperature in Fig. 2 panels for the four pharmaceuticals IBU, DCF, CBZ,
and SMX, and resulting linear fit parameters k0 and k1 are collected in Table 2. The
panels show a consistent trend of WWTP removal rates increasing with temperature
for each of the pharmaceuticals, that is, the k1 values are all positive. The increase
is strongest for SMX which has relatively low amount of data (n = 12). The second
steepest dependence is found for IBU, a trend that agrees well with previous results
in literature, where better WWTP removals at higher temperatures have been reported
for IBU (Vieno et al., 2005; Lindholm-Lehto et al., 2016). The positive temperature
dependence is barely visible for DCF and CBZ. These substances have often been reported with negative WWTP removals (Verlicchi et al., 2012; Lindholm-Lehto et al.,
2016) which obviously affected the fit results. The importance of deconjugation is also
manifested in the negative k0 values. The regression exhibits R2 -values well below 0.1,
which reflects the large variation unaccounted for by temperature in the k-values.
Second, with IBU as the sample molecule, the WWTP-specific variation of r(T )
is discussed. (Online Resource Figs. S1–S4 present r(T ) variation graphically for
each pharmaceutical). The IBU concentrations were collected from twelve individual

WWTP sources, including such data assessed in Fig. 2 where multiple measurements
exist from same WWTP, and adding a set of datapoints where HRT was not known. A
rising trend for r(T ) was observed in eight cases; using Eq. (4) again for the fit parameters, the largest slope r1 for IBU is as high as (0.44 ± 0.82) ◦ C−1 , whereas the average
r1 from all the N = 12 curves settles at (0.05 ± 0.13) ◦ C−1 . Interestingly, three of the
four negative slopes are from IBU data by Conceicao et al. (2023). We will not evaluate
that further, but a better understanding of the cause might provide valuable insight in
some other contexts.
The trend-line parameters for separate WWTPs were averaged to construct an overall view of temperature dependence. The resulting r0 and r1 per-process averages are
collected in Table 3 for each pharmaceutical. Comparison with Table 2 shows that,
aside from SMX, the trend of increasing removal efficiency with increasing temperature is expectedly also visible with the WWTP-specific approach. The RSD given
for the extrapolation parameter r1 was, however, found to exceed 100 % for all the

compounds. Thus the variations in the concentration values and calculated efficiencies
were far from optimal to make good estimates, and readily affected by few “outlier”
data sets. However, the present compilation of data provided a reasonably quantitative
picture of the temperature dependence of WWTP removal capability for these pharmaceuticals.
Removal rate parameters obtained at close temperatures reveal significant intraWWTP variations in some cases (Verlicchi et al., 2012; Burns et al., 2018). Typically,
a slope from just two r(T ) values may exhibit an uncharacteristically high (or low)
value. For example, the largest slope for DCF, based on two data points reported by
Česen et al. (2018) (see Fig. S2), was at 0.3 ◦ C−1 , which is an order of magnitude
higher than the mean value for DCF in Table 3. The DCF results were collected from
N = 13 WWTPs and converted from 35 r(T ) values of which 10 were negative. Despite numerous negative removal values, positive r1 trend prevailed even in the CBZ
case, where 30 r(T ) from the total of 49 were negative. This suggests that either the
deconjugation was less probable at higher temperature or the deconjugation product
(DCF, CBZ) was more efficiently removed then.
To conclude the second approach, we compare the statistics of the above WWTPspecific trends (Table 3, Online Resource Figs. S1–S4) to that of all intra-WWTP trend
data combined in Table 4, where the regression coefficients R2 are averaged over the
number of fits. IBU, for example, was measured in one WWTP at three temperatures
(1 fit) and in four WWTPs at four temperatures (4 fits). Among the 46 IBU measurements overall, possible three-point combinations can be formed in 15180 ways of
which two instances were removed due to temperature overlap. In general, the r(T )
shows markedly higher temperature correlation in the case of intra-WWTP than in the
combined inter-WWTP groups. Adding fourth temperature to the fit weakens the average correlation in combined groups, while intra-WWTP data shows slight increase for
IBU and CBZ. The combination test indicates that the averaging over intra-WWTP results is meaningful as pharmaceutical removal efficiencies seem to exhibit some intraWWTP temperature correlation, and that fitting of the full data collection gives insight
into the extents and variations of this.
Including more variables, such as various stages of the removal, absorption, or
formation of pollutant-specific bacteria strains, would turn the assessment very complicated. Instead, the presented simple compilation and parametrisation is in line with
the way the temperature dependencies of physicochemical parameters of various persistent organic pollutants are tradionally determined in fugacity modelling (Paasivirta

Evaluation of seasonal variations of degradation in aquatic environments

Fig. 3 shows the compiled environmental degradation rates k(T ) for the data collected
from riveresque aquatic environments. The linear fits suggest that the environmental
degradation of IBU and DCF increases with temperature, while that of SMX decreases
and CBZ remains unaffected. As is to be expected (Glaser et al., 2019), when assessing
degradation data from various sources and shaping them into comparable parametrisations, the results tend to be somewhat scattered. The research by Schimmelpfennig
et al. (2016) already demonstrated that lake environments complicate analyzing, even
with the most well-documented and contained scenarios. In addition to the aforementioned, Meierjohann et al. (2016) was another assessed research where the inspected
interval included a lake. Even while the general flow rates of the lake are known, retention and dilution factors of the upstream waters are not straightforward to determine.

Figure 3: Temperature dependency of environmental degradation rate of the four pharmaceuticals
The above direct results for k(T ) can be considered as inconclusive. Therefore, in

Fig. 4, we supplement the compilation by representing the IBU, DCF, and SMX reduction rate constants divided by that of the CBZ at each temperature. The ratios were
obtained from measurements where the IBU/CBZ, DCF/CBZ, and SMX/CBZ pairs
were available. IBU appears the most distinct compound in terms of temperature dependence. Numerically, the environmental degradation of IBU calculated in this way
is approximately equal to that of CBZ at 6 ◦ C but rises to a 30-fold level at 20 ◦ C. In
contrast, the DCF/CBZ ratio only triples from ca. 2 ◦ C to 20 ◦ C. The general trend that
IBU, DCF, and SMX degradation rates are increased by temperature more than that
of the refractory pollutant CBZ, persists. This is consistent with other observations in
this work and in the literature. The negative environmental degradation perceivable
for SMX in Fig. 3 could suggest the presence of conjugates. However, since Fig. 4
indicates that increased temperature correlates with an increase of the SMX degradation rate, the SMX trend in Fig. 3 is likely a result of variations in emissions and the
relatively small data set.

Figure 4: Temperature dependency of degradation rate constants normalised by that of
CBZ for IBU, DCF, and SMX
Finally, the results of CBZ-standardised calculations described by Eqs. (5) and (6)
are shown in Fig. 5 for IBU and DCF, while SMX was left out due to very limited
amount of data. Again, the results suggest a temperature-induced increase of environmental degradation for IBU and DCF. The k(T ) curve for IBU is slightly steeper
than the slope for DCF. However, accounting for the dilution effect by using the dcoefficients significantly reduces the k-values, which can be seen, e.g., by comparing
IBU degradation rates in Figs. 3 and 5. In the former, we have uncorrected values
at k(10 ◦ C) ≈ 0.1 h−1 and k(20 ◦ C) ≈ 0.2 h−1 , whereas in the latter we have approximately 0.01 h−1 and 0.05 h−1 , respectively. These order-of-magnitude differences
suggest that even when inspecting pharmaceutical levels in simple well-known waterways over limited distances, most of the apparent removal might actually be caused by
dilution or other advective processes. This may easily lead to underestimated half-lives
of pharmaceuticals in environment.
The difference between IBU and DCF can be regarded somewhat unexpected, as
their photodegradation and biodegradation half-lives reported in the literature are in

12

Figure 5: Temperature dependency of chemical degradation rate constants for IBU and
DCF with dilution standardised by CBZ
the same range, see Table 1. Similar phenomenon was, however, also visible in our
earlier work, which assessed a completely different set of measurements (Nurmi et al.,
2019). Also the dilution-corrected results by Vieno et al. (2005) independently show an
increase of total IBU mass in some of the measurements, while DCF mass was reduced
by degradation as expected. This data does not include CBZ measurements so it was
not used in our CBZ-standardised evaluation of k.
Unfortunately, the benefits of dilution correction are reduced due to the small
amount of applicable data. This stems from the requirements of information on the
characteristics of the inspected environment and of simultaneous samplings of multiple pharmaceuticals. Also the quality of the calculated k-values is subject to inaccuracies originating from multiple sources. The combined uncertainty becomes notably increased when compared to individual measurements. For example when assessing Zhang et al. (2020), the RSD values for the time-separated pair of CBZ samplings (c0 and c1 ) were 1.2 % and 1.3 %, and the RSDs for coincident IBU samplings were 4.6 % and 1.3 %, respectively. Combining this information quadratically
to obtain the dilution-corrected IBU degradation rate constants yields an uncertainty of
approximately 5.1 %pt for the assessment of concentration. As the calculated dilutioncorrected removal for IBU between c0 and c1 is 13.6 %pt, the scale of uncertainty is
notable.

3.3

Model results

The model results with five different environmental parameter sets are shown in Fig. 6,
and the corresponding degradation half-lives for each of the pharmaceuticals are listed
in Table 5. Due to the equal photodegradation rate used for IBU and DCF, their modelled half-lives are very similar when photolysis happens sufficiently fast, and only
start to differ when the speed difference of intra-environmental migration processes
start to be in the same temporal range. CBZ, with no biodegradation set, was estimated
to degrade the slowest. The slowness of CBZ degradation is also observable, e.g., in

13

the results by Daneshvar et al. (2010a), where CBZ levels remain relatively constant
for a long time while other pharmaceuticals are quickly reduced below the limit of detection. The degradation rate is very slow especially in the low temperature cases, in
agreement with the literature results (Lindholm-Lehto et al., 2016). CBZ ultimately
became strongly concentrated in the sediments, and its elimination was limited by the
speed of resuspension process. It should be noted that only the mass balance was
modelled here, and in differently constructed scenarios, advective processes including
sediment burial would dominate the fate of CBZ especially during cold seasons.

The model results show SMX degrading rather quickly, as is to be expected by
the reaction rates reported by Lam and Mabury (2005) and Xu et al. (2011). This is
somewhat contrary to the environmental sampling results by Schimmelpfennig et al.
(2016), where the half-lives for SMX were found to be in the same range as for CBZ.
Again, deconjugation could be one of the explaining factors (Verlicchi et al., 2012).
Regarding IBAP, its maximum mass in the L3 4 m, 20 ◦ C environment is encountered
at 1200 h from the beginning, where its peak concentration reaches ca. 9 % of the re14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rn4m5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8796-304X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

spective IBU concentration. Being completely formed by degradation reactions, IBAP
concentration timescales exhibit strong dependency on temperature. In the L3 4 m, 1 ◦ C
environment, the peak concentration reached 7 % of the respective IBU concentration
only after 20 000 hours.
Finally, a simple inspection of temporal aspects of sedimentation tubes was committed using the same ideal environment. Pharmaceutical levels in the sedimentation
tube (T) and sediment bed (S) were compared after 7 and 14-day temporal model runs
with the Level III fugacity equilibrium, and the results are shown in Table 6. The mass
transfer to sedimentation tubes is mostly driven by suspended sediments in the water
layers. The DCF and CBZ are both seen to accumulate to concentrations that reach
a fraction of equilibrium within the period of two weeks. Sedimentation of the more
hydrophobic CBZ occurs faster and the equilibrium level is accordingly higher than
for DCF. Comparing the sedimentation tube to the sediment bed value, the first-week
DCF concentration is three orders of magnitude higher. In the sediment bed, DCF already reached the low equilibrium concentration of 2.3 pg/kg. Sedimentation of CBZ
is a markedly faster process but the higher equilibrium concentration was not attained
within two weeks.

We used the same sedimentation speed for the tube and bottom sediments, see Table S3 for parameters. The rate implies that only a 0.02 mm sediment layer is deposited
to the tube during a 14-day campaign. Using higher speeds would further magnify the
concentration differences between sedimentation tubes and sediment beds. This difference is connected to a phenomenon we observed earlier (Nurmi et al., 2019): The
sedimentation tube collects suspended sediments for a relatively short time and the accumulation is likely to follow the concentration of the surrounding water. The fugacity
model, on the other hand, describes an average concentration of a compartment, which
in the case of a sediment bed spreads over hundreds of square meters and into depths
corresponding to several decades of sedimentation. Various environmental changes can
affect the results in that timescale. Such variation could readily translate into the surprisingly frequent lack of detection of pharmaceuticals in sediment samples even when
notable concentrations are measured from water (Lindholm-Lehto et al., 2015).

Application potential of the results

The equations and parameters constructed in this work to estimate WWTP removal
and environmental degradation rates of pharmaceuticals are compiled in Table 7. The
first row is a straightforward listing to obtain T -dependent k-values using Table 2 parameters. The second row predicts c(τ)/c0 -values at a chosen temperature separated
by ∆T from a known condition using Table 3 correlations. The third and fourth rows
quantify the slopes presented in Figs. 3 and 5, respectively, for average environmental
degradation rate constants. In addition to the equations derived from the literature data,
we include formulae based on the half-lives and their temperature dependencies in the
modelled 10×9 m2 cross-section of an aquatic environment, as presented in Fig. 6. The
fits were done with the extra assumption of zero reaction rate at 0 ◦ C.

The WWTP removal correlations provide concrete general values for assessing the
quantitative aspects of seasonal variations. However, the level of uncertainty is relatively high. Therefore, the tabulated formulae are not advised to be directly used
as substitutes for the Fstp water term presented in the European Medicines Agency’s
guideline (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), 2006). Instead, the compilation can be used as a tool to estimate the extents of variation of the
four pharmaceuticals’ environmental concentrations in different seasons. It should be
noted that even though an estimate for environmental degradation can be calculated
based on the modelled characteristics, it is rarely comparable with measurement data,
especially in the colder seasons, due to degradation being overshadowed by dilution,
advection, and various other parameters involved. However, such results are useful
when finding out mass balance and total mass of different pharmaceuticals present in
the inspected environment, which are often specifically interesting questions in light of
results such as the “ecological trap” phenomenon described by Mehdi et al. (2021).
Assessing Table 7, it stands out that the modelled slopes for degradation rate constants are clearly lower than the ones based on the measurement data analysis presented
in this work. In addition to inherent inaccuracies in the data analysis, some possible
16

factors causing the discrepancy might be underestimated biodegradation in the model
as it is only set to happen in bottom sediments, and the fact that the modelled rate is
based on total mass balance of single compounds, while perceived removal rates in
water measurements might be affected by, e.g., conjugates or binding to sediments.
However, the predicted IBU and CBZ half-lives are very much in the same range as the
modelled and field measured data listed by Bodrato and Vione (2014).

Conclusions

In what is to our knowledge the first effort to provide such general quantitative insight,
the effect of seasons on pharmaceutical removal efficancies at WWTP and pharmaceutical degradation in environment was summarised by parametrizing them with temperature. Although variation is present in all the data analysed, for IBU, DCF, and CBZ,
a consistent trend of WWTP removal and environmental degradation rates increasing
with temperature was present in all the results, and the numerical tools provided allow
forming reasonable predictions of their average concentrations in different conditions.
For SMX, the results were inconclusive, partially due to less data available.
While temperature variation can cause dozens-fold changes in pharmaceutical environmental degradation rates, its effect on the observed concentrations is still limited,
due to the levels being mostly dominated by, e.g., pharmaceutical usage patterns and
hydrological phenomena. However, understanding the mass balance as well as the
transformation product concentrations requires insight on the variation of degradation.
Additionally, the presented data analysis method of using CBZ as a quasi-internal standard to provide a baseline for assessing other pharmaceuticals’ environmental concentrations is likely to be of value also in other scenarios.
The presented model results are in line with previous sampling and modelling results, and can thus be used as a tool to get insight on the extent of environmental degradation at various temperatures. The results describe the selected pharmaceuticals in one
type of simplified environment, and similar process could be done to cover other pharmaceuticals and environments of different composition. In addition, the comparisons
of the degradation dynamics and the modelled results on sediments and sedimentation
tubes highlight the various timescales that can be encountered with different sampling
targets and environmental media.
