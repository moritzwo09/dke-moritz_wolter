Abstract
Atmospheric molecular clusters are important for the formation of new aerosol particles in the air. However, current experimental techniques are not able to yield direct
insight into the cluster geometries. This implies that to date there is limited information about how accurately the applied computational methods depict the cluster
structures.
Here we massively benchmark the molecular geometries of atmospheric molecular
clusters. We initially assess how well different DF-MP2 approaches reproduce the geometries of 45 dimer clusters obtained at a high DF-CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 level
of theory. Based on the results we find that the DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory
best resembles the DF-CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 reference level. We subsequently
optimize 1283 acid–base cluster structures (up to tetramers) at the DF-MP2/aug-ccpVQZ level of theory and assess how more approximate methods reproduce the geometries. Out of the tested semi-empirical methods, we find that the newly parameterized
atmospheric molecular cluster extended tight binding method (AMC-xTB) is most reliable for locating the correct lowest energy configuration and yield the lowest RMSD
compared to the reference level. In addition, we find that the DFT-3c methods show
similar performance as the usually employed ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory
at a potentially reduced computational cost. This suggests that these methods could
prove valuable for large-scale screenings of cluster structures in the future.

Introduction

The formation of atmospheric molecular clusters is believed to be the initial step in atmospheric aerosol New Particle Formation (NPF). 1 Aerosol particles directly affect our global
climate via aerosol-radiation interactions. This can either be scattering of sunlight by inorganic particles or absorption of radiation by black carbon. 2 Aerosol particles also indirectly
affect the global climate via aerosol-cloud interactions. 3 For instance, aerosol particles around
50 nm or larger can act as nuclei for cloud droplet formation. Combined, these aerosol effects
present the largest uncertainty in the understanding of our current climate and the prediction of climate change in the future. 4 NPF is a large source of this uncertainty, as it remains
uncertain which atmospheric vapours that are important for the initial cluster formation and
the subsequent growth. 5
Atmospheric low-volatile acids such as Sulfuric Acid (SA), 6 Methanesulfonic Acid (MSA) 7,8
and Nitric Acid (NTA) 9 are believed to play a decisive role in the initial cluster formation
and/or growth process. However, to facilitate the cluster formation process, the low-volatile
acids must react with atmospheric bases such as Ammonia (AM), 10 alkylamines (Methylamine (MA), Dimethylamine (DMA), Trimethylamine (TMA)) 11,12 and diamines (Ethylenediamine (EDA), Putrescine (PUT)). 13,14 At coastal regions iodine species emitted by algae
are conceived to play a pivotal role in cluster formation. 15–17 Depending on the saturation
vapour pressure of the compounds, 18,19 Highly Oxygenated organic Molecules (HOMs) 20,21
can also influence cluster formation 22,23 and growth. 24 Overall, this leads to strongly bound
clusters held together by a combination of hydrogen-bonded interactions and electrostatic
interactions.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure the initial cluster formation using experimental techniques. State-of-the-art instruments such as the Chemical Ionization Atmospheric Pressure interface Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF) 25 can measure
the chemical composition of the clusters. However, the ionization efficiency by different
CI reagent ions (nitrate 26 /bisulfate 27 /acetate 28 /iodide 29 ) varies between individual atmo3
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bvww6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-4329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

spheric species and fragmentation inside the instrument also affect the detection efficiency of
the clusters. 30–33 Overall, CI-APi-TOF measurements only yield the chemical composition
and at the moment there exist no experimental techniques to obtain direct insight into the
exact cluster geometries.
Quantum Chemical (QC) calculations can yield explicit insight into the cluster geometries
and based on statistical mechanics the thermochemistry can be calculated. The calculated
binding free energies can be used to calculate the evaporation rates of the clusters, 34 which
gives information about their corresponding stability under atmospheric conditions. Collision coefficients between monomers/clusters can be calculated using kinetic gas theory.
Combined, the collision and evaporation rates can be used to calculate the cluster formation rate using, for instance, the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC). 35 This gives
knowledge about the potential NPF rate of the species. However, the accuracy of the calculated NPF rates is very dependent on the applied QC methods. This implies that one can
essentially get the NPF rate one is after, and thereby, accurate benchmarks are important
to make an informed and unbiased decision on what QC level of theory to apply.
We have extensively benchmarked the required methodologies for obtaining accurate cluster electronic binding energies. 36–38 In the recent years we have curated the Clusteromics I–V
datasets 39–43 composed of the acids SA, MSA, NTA and Formic Acid (FA) combined with the
bases AM, MA, DMA, TMA and EDA. All combinations of the species have been considered,
leading to a database of a total of 56,436 small acid–base clusters (up to 5 molecules). Based
on previous benchmarks, the cluster geometries and vibrational frequencies were obtained
at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory 44,45 and all data is freely available in the Atmospheric Cluster DataBase (ACDB). 46,47 Recently, we applied the full Clusteromics I–III
datasets to massively assess the electronic binding energies of 11,749 atmospheric molecular
clusters. 48 Such a benchmark set can be used for detailed statistics to be carried out, allowing an informed decision on the best level of theory to apply. However, to date there exist
no benchmark studies that have addressed the geometries of atmospheric molecular clusters.

In this paper we employ the Clusteromics I–V datasets to massively assess the geometries of atmospheric molecular clusters. We initially optimized the geometry of 45 dimer
clusters at the DF-CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 level of theory to probe how well cheaper
wave function theory (MP2) can reproduce the cluster geometries. Based on the results
we utilize DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ to optimize the geometry of a subset of the Clusteromics
I–V datasets. We optimized the geometry of the five lowest configurations of each cluster
composition, yielding a total of 1283 cluster structures. Finally, we compare several faster
and more approximate methods to this DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ geometry dataset and apply
detailed statistics to compare the geometries.

Methodology

2.1

Quantum Chemical Computational Details

For determining the reference method for our geometry benchmark we employed Molpro, 49–51
as analytical gradients are available for DF-MP2 52 /aug-cc-pVnZ (n = D, T, Q), DF-MP2F12 53,54 /cc-pVnZ-F12 55 (n = D, T), and DF-CCSD(T)-F12b 56,57 /cc-pVDZ-F12. In all cases
the default parameters, or as specified by their documentation, was useda . We used DFCCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 as the highest level of theory to determine which variant of
MP2 to use on the larger test set, as discussed in Section 2.1.1 and Section 3.1.
ORCA version 5.0.4 58 was used to optimize the geometries using r2 SCAN-3c, 59 B97-3c, 60
ωB97X-D3BJ, 61 PW91 62 and ωB97X-3c. 63 As ωB97X-3c is not a part of ORCA 5.0.4 the
ORCA4wB97X-3c 64 script was used to set up the calculation. xTB version 6.4.0 65,66 was used
for semi-empirical tight binding optimizations using GFN1-xTB, 67 GFN2-xTB 68 and the
newly parameterized Atmospheric Molecular Cluster (AMC) extended tight binding method
denoted AMC-xTB. 69 Gaussian16 70 was used for PM6 71 and PM7 72 geometry optimizations.

Note that specific parameters are needed for employment of analytical gradients, see Molpro manual in
the section “Explicitly correlated methods”.

2.1.1

Reference Methods

To determine the reference method used for the full test set, we compare 5 levels of MP2 to
DF-CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 calculations. We have chosen the given coupled-cluster
method, as CCSD(T) consistently has been shown to be an excellent reference method and
is extensively used in various prominent benchmarks. 73–77 The explicit correlation approach
(-F12) has been shown to approach the basis set limit faster than the conventional approach. 56,57,78
In cases where CCSD(T) (O(n7 )) is not feasible, MP2 (O(n5 )) is often used as a cheaper
alternative wave function-based approach. MP2 has been shown to give very reliable results 54,79,80 and should be a highly suitable reference for geometries.
We employ the correlation-consistent basis sets, with variants specifically optimized for
the explicitly correlated methods. 81 For the coupled-cluster method “only” the double-zeta
basis set was used as going to larger basis sets was not computationally feasible. However,
because of the explicitly correlated corrections this is still a very decent reference method
for geometry optimizations.

2.2

Molecular Clusters Test Set

We employed the Clusteromics I–V 39–43 datasets for the benchmark. These datasets consist
of clusters of the type (acid)1−2 (base)1−2 and includes mixtures of different acids (SA, MSA,
FA, and NTA) and bases (AM, MA, DMA, TMA, and EDA). Overall, the Clusteromics I–V
datasets contain up to 56,436 cluster structures optimized at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p)
level of theory. This is an insurmountable number of clusters to further optimize at the
MP2 level. Hence, we have chosen to only use the 5 lowest energy structures for each cluster
composition, which in total yields a dataset of 1283 cluster structures.
The goal of this paper is to compare the results of geometry optimizations done at different levels of theory. However, different methods might end up in different optimized
geometries/configurations and this would lead to a skewed comparison. Hence, in the fol6
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bvww6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-4329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

lowing sections (Section 2.3 and Section 2.4) we will give a description of the methods used to
distinguish between different configurations, such that we in Section 3 can directly compare
clusters which have actually been optimized to the same minimum geometry.

2.3

Statistical Tests

2.3.1

The Empirical Distribution Function

In Section 2.4.2 we are interested in determining whether a given dataset follows a specific statistical distribution. Here, a short introduction into statistical tests based on the
Empirical Distribution Function (EDF) is given. 82 Lets consider a random variable X. The
propability that X will give a value less than or equal to the value x is computed by evaluating
the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) at x. Assuming that X follows a distribution
given by the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) fX (t) the probability of X can be
computed giving a value less than or equal to x, that is evaluate the CDF, by integration of
the PDF as follows:
x

fX (t)dt.

FX (x) = ∫

(1)

−∞

Given a random ordered sample of data, denoted as X1 , ..., Xn , drawn from a given CDF
the EDF is defined as:
Fn (x) =

number of observations ≤ x
,
n

(2)

that is, the EDF goes up in value by 1/n for every value, Xi , in the data set as x goes from
−∞ to ∞. This EDF is an approximation of the theoretical CDF, converging as n → ∞.
As Fn (x) approaches the true FX (x) with increasing n, a natural measure to test if the
sample data follows a proposed distribution would involve the difference of these. One such
measure is the Anderson-Darling test which will be employed in the following sections. The
Anderson-Darling statistic is a member of the quadratic statistics defined commonly as:
∞

Q = n∫

{Fn (x) − FX (x)}2 Ω(x)dF (x).

−∞

(3)

When Ω(x) = [FX (x){1 − FX (x)}]−1 the Anderson-Darling statistic is obtained, which will
be denoted A2 . This integral can be transformed into a much more manageable expression:

A2 = −n −

1 n
∑(2i − 1) [log(Zi ) + log(Zn+1−i )] ,
n i=1

(4)

where Zi = FX (Xi ).
2.3.2

Unknown parameters of FX (x)

To evaluate FX (x) the parameters, Γ, are needed for the given distribution, or at least an
estimate of these Γ̂. This leads to a set of scenarios (commonly also called cases) where all
the parameters or only a (potentially empty) subset of them are known. The present work
will operate from the scenario where all parameters are unknown. This entails an estimate
of the parameters, which means that Zi = FX (Xi ; Γ̂). Estimation of the parameters is often
carried out with methods like maximization of the log-likelihood 83 or in the case of the
Cauchy distribution by means of sums of weighted order statistics. 84
For the case of completely unknown parameters the critcal values used to reject the
hypothesis of a given distribution depends on the distribution being tested and the size of
the data set. Tables of critical values exists, we have used the ones provided by Ref. 82
(Table 4.26).

2.4

Algorithm for Comparing Configurations

To compare how similar two molecular structures are, an easy method is to simply compute
the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the two geometries. This can be done
by finding the optimal rotation matrix between the two structures using fx. the Kabsch
algorithm 85 before computing the actual RMSD. This works well for small systems, but
for large systems, such as molecular clusters, this can quickly “hide” small differences. An
example of this could be an ammonia molecule inside a multi-component cluster: If all

8

other monomers are largely the same, but the ammonia sits in a different orientation it is
technically a different configuration, but as there are only 4 atoms in ammonia this deviation
contributes very little to the overall RMSD.
We derived an algorithm (Algorithm 1) which overcomes this problem, which we have
used as a tool in the benchmarking presented in this paper. The algorithm is implemented
and freely available at: https://gitlab.com/AndreasBuchgraitz/clusteranalysis.

The division of molecular clusters into its consisting monomers (Line 3) is done as a
“connectivity map”. This means that for all atoms, Ai , the distance to all other atoms, Aj ,
is computed and these are connected, if they are reasonably close to each other. We have
found that the maximum allowed distance between atoms computed as min(s + s ⋅ 0.3, 2.0Å)
with s being the smallest distance found between Ai and any of the other atoms Aj , to be

a good measure for “reasonably close”. This is done ignoring all hydrogen atoms, which are
added at the end to the monomer for which they are in closest proximity to.
The computation of the rotation matrix (Line 9) is performed using the Kabsch algorithm.
In the main part of the algorithm (Line 4 to Line 12) a loop over all the optimized cluster
geometries for all the computational methods which should be compared to the reference
method is performed (Line 6). Now, this cluster geometry should compared to the reference
geometry. This is done in such a way that, if the two structures are identical, a lot of zeroes
are computed, such that there are as many numbers as possible to analyse in the later part
of the algorithm. The idea is that if two clusters are identical then the rotation matrix from
any pair of equivalent monomers should be equal and equal to the rotation matrix for the
entire cluster. So if this is assumed and the rotation matrix for all monomer pairs (Line 9)
is computed and applied to all monomers (Line 11) the discrepancy can be computed for all
the M 2 rotated monomer pairs (M being the number of monomers) (Line 12).
The “discrepancy” computed for the rotated monomers (Line 12) is based on two different
measurements: 1) the difference between all position coordinates (3N numbers for N atoms),
2) cos(θ) with θ being the angle between estimations of the dipole-moments of the two
monomers. The estimation of the dipole-moments is based on the electronegativity and
number of electrons in the outer shell of the atoms. This gives a decent estimate of the
orientation of the dipole-moment though the magnitude is likely off by many magnitudes.
However, we are only interested in analysing the orientation of the monomers.
Analysis of the discrepancy (Line 13) is performed in two ways for the two different
measurements of deviation, as seen in the following two sections.

2.4.1

Analysis 1: Angles of the Dipole Moments

The analysis of the angle deviation can return three conclusions: “DefinitelyTheSameAsReference”, “SameAsReference”, and “DifferentFromReference”. The conclusion is based
on the value of cos(θ) compared to two chosen values: 0.96 and 0.76, which corresponds

10
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bvww6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-4329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

to approximately 16.26° and 40.54° respectively. If all computed values of cos(θ) are larger
than 0.96 “DefinitelyTheSameAsReference” is returned, else if all values are larger then
0.76 then “SameAsReference” is returned, else “DifferentFromReference” is returned. The
check values are chosen as a rather tight value and a rather loose value, respectively. If the
cluster pass the tight check it is very likely that it is the same configuration as the cluster
computed at the reference level of theory. If the cluster only pass the loose check it also
needs to pass the coordinate difference analysis (see below) for the cluster to be labeled as
“SameAsReference” otherwise it is labeled as “DifferentFromReference”.

2.4.2

Analysis 2: Coordinate Differences

The analysis of the coordinate differences is performed using the methods described in Section 2.3. The targeted distribution is a Cauchy distribution, with PDF

f (x) =

γ
1
,
2
π γ + (x − x0 )2

(5)

as it approaches the Dirac delta function when the scale parameter, γ, approaches zero. 86
This is an appropriate limit, because if the two clusters are exactly the same geometry then
the coordinate difference distribution would exactly be the Dirac-delta function. In reality
the two geometries are not exactly the same when optimized at two different levels of theory,
but assuming the differences between the two compared geometries is small, the differences
should be able to be described well using the Cauchy distribution. Whereas, if the differences
between the two geometries are large, fx. if one or more monomers have been significantly
rotated, the data should not follow the cauchy distribution.
As an example, Figure 1 shows the distribution of the coordinate differences together
with the proposed PDF, and the EDF with the proposed CDF. This have been plotted for
two clusters where the first, (NTA)1 (SA)1 (EDA)2 , has optimized to the same minimum as
the reference, and the second, (FA)1 (MSA)1 (TMA)1 , has optimized to a minimum different

from the reference method. It is here quite clear to see that the first cluster decently follows
the proposed distribution, while the second cluster deviates significantly.

the atomic positions for two molecular clusters. The geometries compared are optimized at
the reference level (DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ) and r2 SCAN-3c. The proposed fit is obtained
through sums of weighted order statistics 84 for the cauchy PDF. In the two lower panels the
EDF for the same data is plotted alongside the CDF for a cauchy distribution (using the
same parameters as the PDF).
To test whether the coordinate differences comes from a Cauchy distribution the AndersonDarling statistic is utilised as described in Section 2.3. If the Anderson-Darling statistics
does not reject the Cauchy distribution as a distribution for the coordinate differences this
part of the analysis label the given cluster as ”SameAsReference” otherwise ”DifferentFrom-

2.4.3

Final Configuration Assignment

The final part of the analysis is to compare the results from the two sub-analyses in the
previous sections. As shortly described above, there are three scenarios leading to two
results: 1) the angle deviation analysis labels the cluster as ”DefinitelyTheSameAsReference”
which leads to the cluster overall being labeled as ”SameAsReference”, 2) if both the angle
deviation and coordinate difference analyses label the cluster as ”SameAsReference” the
cluster is saved as ”SameAsReference”, 3) if only one or neither of the sub-analyses labels
the cluster as ”SameAsReference” it is saved as ”DifferentFromReference”.

Results and Discussion

3.1

Geometry Benchmark - Dimer Clusters

Before comparing the geometry optimization of different computational methods a reference
method needs to be established. We employed the previously used set of 45 small dimer
clusters found in Ref. 38. When choosing the reference method two concepts should be kept
in mind, accuracy and computational wall time. When initially investigating the possible
reference method on this small set of dimers a level of theory can be used which would be
impossible to apply for the entire 1283 cluster data set described in Section 2.2.
To jugde the accuracy of the potential reference methods two measures are used, the
electronic dissociation energy and the RMSD. The RMSD value is an obvious choice when
comparing the geometry of small molecules or clusters. The electronic dissociation energy
gives a decent estimate of the electronic potential without requiring specific information
about “shape” of the potential.
Figure 2 compares the dissociation energy of five different levels of DF-MP2 to DFCCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12. The dissociation energy in question is from the bottom of

Figure 2: Dissociation energy deviations. Computed as the difference between the minimum
electronic energy of the dimer and the minimum electronic energy of the isolated monomers.
The deviations from the high level of theory have been plotted as violinplots with a
boxplot on top. These together give a good sense of the distribution of the data as the
boxplots contain 25 % of the data in each of the four sections, and the violinplots highlighting
the distribution making it a bit easier to see where most of the data points are located (where
the violinplots are the widest).
In all cases there seem to be an offset of approximately 0.5 kcal/mol in the De -values
compared to the reference DF-CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 calculations. Overall, decent

agreement between most of the MP2 methods is seen, with DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ deviating
and being slightly worse. Accuracy-wise the DF-MP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 calculations of the
De best resembles the DF-CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVDZ-F12 reference.
Figure 3 shows the RMSD between the high level reference and the 5 tested levels of MP2
methods. Four of the violinplots seem to have an outlier, this is because they find a slightly
different geometry compared to the coupled cluster geometry. In all cases there is a slight
shift in the geometries with median RMSD differences between roughly 0.01 Å and 0.03 Å.
Overall, good agreement between the two F12 methods and the DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ is
seen, and again DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ seems to be quite off. Here it actually seems that
DF-MP2-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 would be the optimal choice for accuracy, but the difference
between this and DF-MP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 and DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ is so small that
we attribute this to a lucky cancellation of errors.

Based on accuracy DF-MP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 performs the best compared to the reference method, but as mentioned, computational wall time is also a significant factor.
DF-MP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 took about 200 hours to optimize one of the larger systems
((MSA)1 (TMA)1 ) in the dimer cluster test set while DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ only took about
4 hours. Even though DF-MP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 would be the best choice, it is simply not
feasible when going to larger cluster sizes containing up to four monomers. Hence, based on
both the calculated De -values and the RMSD, we will employ the DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ
level of theory as the reference method for optimizing the geometries of the large 1283 cluster
test set.

Geometry Benchmark - Full Test Set

3.2.1

Configurational Ordering

Using the DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory as reference method, the full set of 1283
cluster geometries were optimized and compared to several approximate methods using the
algorithm described in Section 2.4. These methods have been chosen based on previous
benchmarks on atmospheric molecular clusters and their wide application in cluster formation
studies. Table 1 presents the number of clusters labeled as “SameAsReference” and what
fraction of the clusters this corresponds to for all the tested methods.

It is seen that r2 SCAN-3c, ωB97X-3c, ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p), and ωB97X-D3BJ/augcc-pVTZ finds the same minimum as the reference for more than 92% of the clusters indicating that these works very well for these types of systems. B97-3c also performs very
well with 87% of the clusters as the same minimum geometry. This implies that the significantly cheaper r2 SCAN-3c and ωB97X-3c methods might be a good alternative to the usually
employed ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory for obtaining the cluster strutcures.
Interestingly, there is seen little difference between increasing the basis set size from 631++G(d,p) to aug-cc-pVTZ for ωB97X-D3BJ. Based on the large aug-cc-pVTZ basis set it
is seen that PW91 is performing significantly worse than the ωB97X-D3BJ functionals with
only 66% of the clusters being assigned to the correct minimum. This is consistent with numerous previous benchmarks of the binding energies of atmospheric molecular clusters. 38,48
The semi-empirical methods PM6 and PM7 find less than 40% of the clusters to be the
same minimum. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB are performing slightly better, but only finds
the presumed correct minimum 56% and 57% of the time, respectively. This illustrates that
these methods cannot reliable identify the correct configurations and should only be used
as pre-screening tools in configurational sampling and not for the final geometries. This is
consistent with the previous work by Kurfman et al. 87 for (SA)3 cluster configurations and

17

the work by Wu et al. 88 on large (SA)n (AM/DMA)n clusters, with n = 1 − 20. The newly
parameterized AMC-xTB method is performing significantly better than the other semiempirical methods. Hence, AMC-xTB should be the best method to use for pre-optimization
of atmospheric molecular clusters during cluster configurational sampling. It should be noted
that AMC-xTB was parameterized on the full clusteromics I–V data sets and thereby the
improved performance is not surprising.

3.2.2

Geometry RMSD

Besides looking at the number of configurations which have been optimized to the same
minimum as the reference method, the quality of these minima can also be investigated.
Figure 4 shows the RMSD compared to the reference structures. Here, the RMSD for all
the clusters which have been labeled as “SameAsReference” have been plotted using the
same violinplot and boxplot style as previously. Very similar to the results listed in Table 1
it is seen that the 4 best performing methods are r2 SCAN-3c, ωB97X-3c, ωB97X-D3BJ/631++G(d,p), and ωB97X-D3BJ/aug-cc-pVTZ. This again indicates that the r2 SCAN-3c and
ωB97X-3c functionals should yield reliable geometries of atmospheric molecular clusters. The
B97-3c method is again also seen as a strong alternative. Similar to the previous section the
semi-empirical methods PM6, PM7, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB and AMC-xTB gives the worst
results. PM6 and PM7 again performs worse than GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB. The newly
parameterized AMC-xTB method has a slightly lower RMSD and more narrow distribution
compared to other semi-empirical methods. This further illustrates the robustness of the
AMC-xTB method.
Besides looking at the RMSD the two measurements used in Algorithm 1 could also
be analysed. Figures similar to Figure 4 have been included in the supporting information
where the plotted values are, the maximum deviation between the orientations of the dipole
moments for the monomers in a given cluster, and the maximum value of a coordinate deviation. The trend is overall the same as seen for the RMSD in Figure 4. Figures showing the

distributions for all three measurements for the clusters labeled as “DifferentFromReference”
are also included in the supporting information.
Overall, the fact that ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) performs well compared to higher
level methods, both in regards to locating the correct lowest energy minimum and with
respect to RMSD, further strengthens its wide utilization in cluster formation studies.

3.3

Timings

The actual computational wall time is a decisive factor in how many cluster configurations
can be optimized at the final DFT level. We tested the computational timings for two of the
largest clusters from our test set: (FA)1 (MA)2 (MSA)1 which has 28 atoms and (DMA)2 (FA)2
which has 30 atoms.
Figure 5 presents the (unparallelized) CPU times of the most promising methods relative
to PW91/aug-cc-pVTZ. We have left out the semi-empirical methods in this figure as these
are all extremely fast (very few optimizations taking more than a couple of seconds).
Non-surprisingly, it is seen that B97-3c and r2 SCAN-3c are very cheap while DF-MP2/augcc-pVQZ is the most expensive. We do not see a huge time-advantage of the ωB97X-3c
method over the ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. If this is compared to Ref.
63, where they show some timings for ωB97C-3c, they have much larger system size (381
atoms) and they compare to the DFT functional ωB97X-V with a quadruple zeta basis set,
where the largest basis set compared here is the triple zeta basis set.
Overall, it is seen that all the DFT-3c methods are performing well compared to the
reference DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory and can potentially be used as alternatives
to the usually employed ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) level for obtaining accurate cluster
geometries, with a potential gain in computational efficiency. This gain in efficiency will
be significantly improved for larger cluster systems, where the ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p)
level of theory becomes prohibitively expensive. It should be noted that besides the geometries, the accuracy of the vibrational frequencies is also important as they are used to

reliable free energies, a large scale investigation of the accuracy of the vibrational frequencies
should be performed in the future.

Conclusions

We have massively assessed the accuracy of various approximate methodologies in yielding
accurate geometries of atmospheric molecular clusters compared to a reference DF-MP2/augcc-pVQZ level of theory. Out of the tested semi-empirical methods (PM6, PM7, GFN1-xTB,
GFN2-xTB and AMC-xTB) we find that the newly parameterized Atmospheric Molecular
Cluster (AMC) extended tight-binding method is vastly superior. Hence, we can recommend
that AMC-xTB is used for pre-optimization during configurational sampling of atmospheric
molecular clusters.
We find that the DFT-3c methods and ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) all perform well,
both in regard to finding the correct lowest minimum cluster configuration and based on
overall RMSD. The fact that ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) performs well compared to higher
level methods based on a large test set further strengthens its wide utilization in cluster formation studies. Based on computational timings the B97-3c and r2 SCAN-3c methods look
very promising for obtaining accurate geometries at a reduced computational cost. For the
cluster sizes investigated here ωB97X-3c and ωB97X-D3BJ/6-31++G(d,p) are comparable
in accuracy and speed, but for larger systems ωB97X-3c might have an advantages in computational cost.
In addition to the geometries, the accuracy of the vibrational frequencies is also important
for atmospheric cluster formation, as they are used to determine the thermal contribution
to the free energy of the clusters. Therefore, we suggest that a study of the accuracy of the
vibrational frequencies of a large representative test set should be performed in the future.
