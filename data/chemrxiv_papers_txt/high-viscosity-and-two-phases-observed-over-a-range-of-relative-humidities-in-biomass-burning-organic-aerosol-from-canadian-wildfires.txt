Abstract

Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) is a major contributor to organic aerosol in the
atmosphere. The impacts of BBOA on climate and health depend strongly on their
physicochemical properties, including viscosity and phase behaviour (number and types of
phases); these properties are not yet fully characterized. We collected BBOA field samples during
the 2021 British Columbia wildfire season to constrain the viscosity and phase behaviour at a range
of relative humidities, and compared them to previous studies on BBOA. Particles from all samples
exhibited two-phased behaviour with a polar hydrophilic phase and a non-polar hydrophobic
phase. We used the poke-flow viscosity technique to estimate the viscosity of the particles. Both
phases of the BBOA had viscosities >108 Pa s at relative humidities up to 50%. Such high
viscosities correspond to mixing times within 200 nm BBOA particles of >5 h. Two phases and
high viscosity have implications for how BBOA should be treated in atmospheric models.

Biomass burning, organic aerosol, viscosity, phase behaviour, phase separation

This study examines the viscosity and phase behaviour of biomass burning organic aerosol
(BBOA) collected from wildfires in Western Canada. The field-collected BBOA contains two
organic phases and is highly viscous, with implications for modelling studies of BBOA.

Introduction
Aerosols, small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air, are found throughout the troposphere
and originate from both anthropogenic (e.g. vehicle exhaust) and natural sources (e.g. wildfires).
Biomass burning is a significant contributor to aerosol concentrations in most regions of the

world.1–8 Smoke from biomass burning consists of mostly organic aerosol, referred to as biomassburning organic aerosol (BBOA).9 For example, smoke sampled from wildfires in the western
U.S.A. consisted of > 90% BBOA.10,11 BBOA can cause negative health effects.1,12–15 In addition,
BBOA contains light absorbing molecules known as brown carbon (BrC) that warm the climate
by absorbing sunlight.16–20 BBOA also acts as nuclei for liquid cloud droplets and possibly ice
clouds, thereby indirectly modifying the climate.21–23 As climate change continues, the frequency
and intensity of wildfires is increasing in many regions due to rising temperatures and changing
precipitation patterns.24–27 This should cause the portion of aerosols attributed to biomass burning
to grow.

Viscosity and phase behavior (number and types of phases) influence the role of BBOA in air
quality and climate. For example, if BBOA contains two phases, then the equilibrium partitioning
of gas phase species into the BBOA is changed compared to the non-phase separated case, which
impacts how the particles grow and gain mass – in turn influencing their health and climate
impacts.28–30 The presence of two non-crystalline phases has also been shown to change cloud
condensation nuclei activity.31–33 Compared to a well-mixed droplet, a phase-separated droplet
with a low polarity organic outer phase has lower surface tension, which lowers the barrier to cloud
condensation.33 If the BBOA particles are sufficiently viscous, the viscosity could limit reactions
within the particles by limiting intra-particle diffusion rates.34–41 Furthermore, if BBOA particles
have a viscosity > 1012 Pa s (i.e. the particles are in a glassy state), they may be good nuclei for
crystalline ice and influence the properties and frequency of ice clouds.22

Several studies have directly or indirectly determined the viscosity of laboratory-generated BBOA
using the poke-flow technique, volatility measurements, and fluorescence techniques.34,35,42,43
Several studies have also investigated the phase behavior of laboratory-generated BBOA using
optical, fluorescence, and electron microscopy techniques.34,44–49 While the previous laboratory
studies have been useful, the composition of BBOA in the real atmosphere may be different than
the composition of BBOA generated in the laboratory for several reasons including atmospheric
aging of BBOA, higher degrees of dilution, and burning conditions (e.g. fuel type, temperature,
humidity, availability of oxygen). These factors could lead to atmospheric BBOA having a very
different viscosity than what is assumed based on laboratory results, and phase behaviour may
differ as well.50,51 Particularly, phase separation has been explained as being driven by differences
in polarity, approximated by the oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O:C).52–57 Atmospheric aging increases
O:C,58,59 so atmospheric aging of particles could change their phase behaviour.

Field studies of the viscosity and phase behavior of BBOA have relied mostly on electron
microscopy measurements. In these studies, a type of BBOA known as tar balls has been identified
alongside other organic particles.60–63 Tar balls are operationally defined as particles that are
spherical and stable when viewed with an electron microscope. The fact that they are still spherical
after collection on an electron microscope substrate indicates that the viscosity of tar balls is very
high (≳ 109 Pa s) at the conditions used for collection.64 Most often electron microscopy
measurements are carried out under a vacuum. Hence, a limitation of electron microscopy analysis
of BBOA is that high volatility organic aerosol is likely lost in these studies.65,66

In the following, we carried out complementary studies to those described above, aiming to
improve our understanding of the phase behavior and viscosity of BBOA. We investigated the
viscosity and phase-behavior of BBOA samples collected from forest fire smoke in British
Columbia, Canada. Viscosity was probed with the poke-flow technique and phase-behavior was
measured with optical microscopy as a function of relative humidity (RH). All experiments were
carried out at atmospheric pressure.

Methods and Materials
BBOA Collection. Forest fire BBOA was collected on 47 mm PTFE membrane filters (MTL,
USA) at the University of British Columbia – Okanagan (Kelowna, Canada) and Thompson Rivers
University (Kamloops, Canada) (see sample locations in Figure S1) in early August 2021 during
heavy forest fire activity. Here we focus on two samples: one collected in Kelowna from August
3rd to August 6th and one collected in Kamloops from August 2nd to August 5th. PM2.5
concentrations during the two sampling periods reached over 200 µg m-3, according to British
Columbia air quality monitoring stations located in the same cities as the collection sites (Figure
S2). The air quality monitoring stations were approximately 10 km away in Kamloops and 2 km
away in Kelowna. Data was acquired from the BC Air Data Archive Website.67 PM2.5
concentrations during sampling were on average higher in Kamloops than in Kelowna (Figure S2,
Table S1). From January 1st 2021 to June 20th 2021, before the start of the wildfire season, the
mean daily PM2.5 concentrations in Kelowna and Kamloops were 4.8 and 5.5 µg m-3, respectively
(Figure S3, Table S1).

Satellite measurements show many forest fires surrounding Kamloops and Kelowna during
sampling (Figure S1). Fire locations were gathered from the Fire Information for Resource
Management System (FIRMS) U.S./Canada, using data from VIIRS NOAA-20, VIIRS S-NPP,
MODIS Aqua and MODIS Terra.68

Forests in the burnt regions primarily consist of trees in the Pinaceae family, such as Douglas-fir
and lodgepole pine.69,70 Back trajectories suggest that the field samples contained smoke from fires
of varying distance from the collection sites and had an atmospheric age of approximately 12 hours
or less (Figure S1). The back trajectories were run with the HYSPLIT transport and dispersion
model on the READY website from NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (ARL).71,72 Back
trajectories were run once every 12 hours during the sampling period with a starting height of 0 m
and using GFS meteorology (0.25 degrees, global).

For sampling, scroll pumps (Agilent, USA) were used to draw approximately 30 L min-1 through
the filters until roughly 5 mg of PM2.5 was collected on each filter. The mass on each filter was
estimated based on PM2.5 concentrations from the air quality monitoring stations located in the
same cities as the collection sites (Figure S2) and daily in-line flow meter measurements (Mass
Flow Meter 4043, TSI, USA). Based on calculations using archived hourly air quality data, we
estimate that the Kelowna sample had 4.5 mg of PM2.5, 88% of which was from wildfires, while
the Kamloops sample had 8.1 mg of PM2.5, 96% from wildfires (Table S1).

Sample Preparation. BBOA filters were extracted with a 1/1 (v/v) solution of methanol (HPLC
grade, Sigma-Aldrich)/water (HPLC grade, Thermo Scientific). Filters were cut into quarters and

placed in glass vials into which 1.5 mL of solvent was added, and then shaken on a platform shaker
at 200 rpm for 2 hours. Afterwards, the solutions were passed through 13 mm diameter, 0.45 µm
pore Fluoropore membrane syringe filters (Millipore, USA) to remove soot and other insoluble
components. Filtered extracts were stored in glass vials at 4°C and wrapped in aluminum foil to
limit their exposure to light and avoid any photochemistry. Hems et al. and Trofimova et al.
showed that water extracts 70-75% of unaged BBOA, while organic solvents, including methanol,
are able to extract nearly 100% of unaged BBOA mass.73,74 As BBOA is aged, the amount that can
be extracted with water is expected to increase and the amount extracted with methanol may
decrease as oxidation will increase BBOA’s polarity. We therefore expect our extract to have
recovered between 70 to 100% of the organic aerosol material from the filters.

Phase behaviour. Samples for phase behaviour experiments were prepared by nebulizing extracts
of the BBOA filters onto 13 mm diameter glass slides coated with FluoroPel 800 (Cytonix, USA),
a hydrophobic coating, to promote spherical droplet formation. Extracts were nebulized using a
syringe pump and a pneumatic nebulizer (Part #G1946-67098, Agilent, USA) with a sheath gas
flow of 15 L min-1 to dry the particles (Figure S4). The particles were then collected on the glass
slides using a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI-II 120, TSI, USA) (Figure S4).
After impaction, the slides were conditioned at 95% relative humidity (RH) overnight above a
saturated KNO3 solution in a sealed jar.75 The high RH values allowed for the impacted particles
to take up water and grow and take on more spherical shapes, which are better for imaging. To
observe the phase behaviour, the slides were imaged at relative humidity values ranging from 0100% within an RH-controlled flow cell with glass windows coupled to a microscope (Axiotech
100 HD reflected-light microscope, Zeiss, Germany).76 The RH was ramped from 0 to 100% over
the course of 2 hours, then decreased back to 0% RH over 2 hours. Results are only shown for
decreasing RH experiments since the same behavior was observed when the RH was increased
and decreased.

Poke-flow measurements. The poke-flow technique was used to constrain the viscosities of the
inner and outer phases of the BBOA particles.77–79 Poke flow measurements were done on the
same prepared samples used for the phase behaviour measurements. The setup was similar to that
used previously.78–81 The samples were put in a humidified flow cell which has a window on the
bottom to allow viewing by an inverted microscope (ME1400TC-INF, AmScope, USA). The cell
also has a hole in the top, sealed by a flexible latex membrane, through which an ultrafine needle
(13561-10, Ted Pella Inc., USA) is inserted. The needle is moved using a micromanipulator to
poke BBOA particles. Experiments were conducted at 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% RH, and the
particles were conditioned in the flow cell for 3 hours before being poked. Poking caused the
particles to crack if they were highly viscous, or else resulted in the formation of a hole in the
particle which would recover over time to reduce the surface free energy of the system. Images of
the particles were recorded for 2 hours after poking. Each measurement was taken at least twice.

At 30%, 40%, and 50% RH, the particles cracked and did not flow during the 2 hour observation
time (see below). For these cases, the viscosity is assigned ≳ 2.5×108 Pa s based on fluid dynamics
simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 (COMSOL, Sweden) with a quarter sphere model of a
cracked particle.78,80,81 In short, the viscosity in the simulation was adjusted until the edge of the
cracked particles in the simulation moved by 0.5 µm in 2 hours. In the simulations we assumed

that the surface tension was 30 mN m-1 and the slip length was 5 nm, as conservative lower limits.
The viscosity that gave 0.5 µm of movement in 2 hours was 2.5×108 Pa s. Since the movement in
our experiments was less than 0.5 µm (based on the resolution of our microscope), and the surface
tension and slip length used in the simulations were conservative lower limits, a viscosity of
2.5×108 should be consider a lower limit to the viscosities in the experiments when cracking and
no flow was observed over 2 hours.

At 60% RH, the particles did not crack and rather a hole formed and slowly recovered over time
(see below). Fluid dynamics simulations based on a half-torus model have been developed to
determine the viscosity of single-phase particles that formed a hole after poking and slowly
recovered.78,79 However, in the current experiments, the BBOA particles contain two phases (see
below). Since the previously developed half-torus model is based on single-phase particles, we did
not attempt to apply this model to the current results. Developing and testing a half-torus model
for two-phase particles is beyond the scope of the current study. Along with designing a new
model, we would need information about the interactions between the two phases, e.g. the
interfacial tension, which is not information we have knowledge of. As a result, we were not able
to assign a viscosity to the poke flow experiments at 60% RH. Our approach of only assigning a
viscosity to multiphase particles that cracked and did not flow is similar to the approach used by
others when constraining the viscosity of field-collected multiphase samples.82,83

Samples for the poke-flow experiments were prepared by nebulizing 1/1 (v/v) solutions of
methanol and water containing BBOA extracts. Even though the BBOA particles were exposed to
a methanol-free carrier gas for an extended time after formation, we cannot rule out trace amounts
of residual methanol remaining in the BBOA particles from the extraction process. For RH values
of 0-50 %, we report a lower limit to the viscosity of the field-collected BBOA samples based on
the observations that the particles shatter and did not flow (see below). The further removal of any
residual methanol from the BBOA particles would not change the reported lower limits to
viscosity, since methanol has a low viscosity and removal of any residual methanol would only
increase the viscosity of our particles.

Aerosol Mass Spectrometry. A high-resolution time-of-flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HRToF-AMS) (Aerodyne, USA) was used to measure the mass spectra of the BBOA extracts. The
working principle and operation of the HR-ToF-AMS are described in detail elsewhere;84–86
briefly, the AMS measures electron-ionization mass spectra of aerosol particles sampled from
ambient air and can report the bulk aerosol quantities of organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, and
chloride mass concentrations. The vaporizer current was set to 1 A. To prepare the sample in a
form that could be sampled by the AMS, extracts were nebulized using the same syringe pump
pneumatic nebulizer used for the phase behaviour measurements (Figure S4). After nebulization,
samples were diluted and dried with a sheath gas flow of 10 to 15 L min-1. The aerosol then passed
through a home-built diffusion dryer packed with 30 cm of molecular sieves (Type 4A beads 8-12
mesh, Supelco, Germany) and 30 cm of activated charcoal (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to remove any
residual water and methanol, respectively, and then sampled by the AMS (Figure S4). Highresolution AMS data were processed using Squirrel v1.66 and PIKA 1.26 in the Igor Pro software
environment (WaveMetrics, USA). Elemental ratios were estimated using the Improved Ambient

Results and Discussion

Chemical composition of the BBOA particles. The AMS results (Figure S5 and Table 1)
indicate that both the BBOA samples were mainly organic (> 90 wt %), which is consistent with
previous measurements of BBOA from laboratory burns of pine wood.11 The O:C was 0.73-0.74,
which is higher than for freshly emitted laboratory BBOA and unaged field BBOA but consistent
with some BBOA aged for intermediate timescales.2,89

Phase behavior. Both samples showed two phases across the full range of RH values (Figure 1).
Phase behaviour results were the same when increasing and decreasing the RH. Others have shown
that phase separation can occur in mixtures of primary organic aerosol (POA) and secondary
organic aerosol (SOA), and in mixtures of different types of SOA, if the organic molecules making
up the mixtures have a difference of > 0.2 in O:C values.52,53,56,57 In addition, previous studies have
shown that unaged BBOA can contain organic molecules with a wide range of O:C values.2,90
Therefore, phase separation in our BBOA can be explained by a large difference in O:C values of
the organic molecules making up the BBOA. Our samples also likely contain secondary BBOA in
addition to primary BBOA. Secondary BBOA should have organic molecules with higher O:C
values than primary BBOA,58,59 further enhancing phase separation when mixed with primary
BBOA. Phase separation in aerosol particles can also be driven by the coexistence of organic and
inorganic salts which are soluble in water,44,91,92 but the AMS results (Table 1) indicate that BBOA
samples from both sites were mainly organic. Hence, the presence of inorganic salts was most
likely not the main driver for the two phases.

It is likely that very low polarity compounds in the BBOA samples, such as long-chain
hydrocarbons, were not extracted by methanol and water. If these compounds are present in the
whole BBOA prior to sampling, they should have an even lower O:C than any compounds we
extracted, thereby increasing the tendency for there to be phase separation.

In most cases, the particles assumed an approximately core-shell morphology. The outer phase can
be identified as a less polar, hydrophobic organic phase while the inner phase is the more polar
and hydrophilic of the two. As humidity increased in the flow cell, the inner phase usually swelled,
showing that it was more hydrophilic and more polar. Higher polarity is generally expected to lead
to higher surface tension, thus the higher polarity compounds are expected to comprise the inner
phase to minimize the total surface energy of the system, assuming enough time for diffusion and
equilibration within the particles.93 Others have shown that methanol-soluble BrC from biomass
burning has a higher absorption of light than water-soluble BrC, suggesting that most of the colour
comes from the less polar molecules.94 We should therefore expect the low-polarity hydrophobic
outer phase to be darker in colour, which is indeed observed in the particles in Figure 1.

Viscosity. The viscosities of the BBOA were probed using the poke-flow technique. If the particles
cracked upon being poked and then did not show any signs of recovery after 2 hours, they were
classified as being amorphous solids (also known as glassy) or highly viscous semi-solids with
viscosities of at least 2.5×108 Pa s.78,80,81 Amorphous solids have a viscosity of >1012 Pa s and

As shown in Figure 2, both the Kamloops and the Kelowna samples shattered at 30% RH and the
shards did not show any signs of flowing. Experiments were not conducted at drier conditions,
because lowering the RH can only lead to the same or even higher viscosities, and therefore the
same shattering result.64 At 40% RH, the particles also shattered with no signs of flow. For the
Kamloops sample, the poke in the center of the droplet did not cause cracks to extend all the way
to the outer phase, so another poke was made in the outer phase as quickly as possible (near the
top of the particle in Figure 2, second row), and this poke caused clear cracks in the outer phase.

At 50% RH, poking the center of the Kamloops sample caused cracks in the outer phase but only
a hole in the inner phase, without cracks. For the Kelowna sample at the same relative humidity, a
poke in the center caused cracks from the center to the outer edge. Again, there were no signs of
recovery in any of the cracked particles at 40 or 50% RH. We conclude that our samples had at
least one phase that was semi-solid or amorphous solid with a viscosity ≥ 2.5×108 Pa s for RH
values of 50% or less. The bottom panel in Figure 3 shows the distributions of hourly RH
measurements in Kamloops and Kelowna. The RH at both Kamloops and Kelowna during sample
collection was often below 50%. Hence, RH values of 50% or less are often relevant for our
samples.

At 60% RH, both samples were poked once in the inner phase and once on the outer phase (Figure
2, fourth row), forming holes in the particles with no signs of cracking. After 2 hours, the hole in
the middle almost fully recovered while the outer phase did not move. The unmoving outer phase
may have been due to a difference in the total restorative forces acting on the outer edge of the
droplet compared to the middle and the thinness of the outer phase, or, alternatively, the outer
phase may have been more viscous than the inner phase. Without fluid dynamics simulations that
include the geometry and interfacial tensions of the two phases, it is not possible to conclusively
distinguish between these cases. Experiments were not conducted at > 60% RH, because a higher
RH can only lead to lower viscosities as the particles take up water.64

The Kelowna and Kamloops samples comprised 88% and 96% wildfire BBOA, respectively
(Table S1). We estimated the influence of background non-BBOA on our measured viscosities
using calculations based on the Arrhenius-type mixing rule (Supplementary Information Section
S1).96 The calculations show that the background non-BBOA does not have a large influence on
the lower limits to viscosities reported here for the BBOA. E.g. the presence of background nonBBOA could, at most, decrease our reported lower limit by a factor of 3 for the Kelowna sample.

Comparison with previous BBOA phase behavior measurements. The observation of two
phases is consistent with the results by Gregson et al. who observed two phases in BBOA particles
generated from smoldering pine wood in the laboratory and sampling BBOA directly on
microscope slides using an impactor and without extraction with a solvent.34 Visual differences
between our samples in Figure 1 herein and Figure 1 in Gregson et al. are likely, in large part, due
to the different types of microscopes being used (fluorescence in Gregson et al. vs. optical herein).
The fact that the impacted BBOA in Gregson et al. shows the same phase behaviour as our extracts
possibly suggests that a mixture of methanol and water extracted a wide enough range of the
compounds in BBOA to accurately describe its phase behaviour.

Jahn et al. also observed that some particles from the combustion of sawgrass in the laboratory
displayed two organic phases under dry conditions (0% RH) using electron microscopy. Two
distinct organic phases have also been observed in field-collected BBOA samples under dry
conditions. China et al. observed two distinct types of tar balls in field samples, one less oxidized
than the other.47 Hand et al. and Tivanski et al. also found that some types of tar balls in fieldcollected samples had more oxygen in the outer layers.48,49 The later observations are consistent
with two phases, although the observations of a more hydrophilic phase on the outside of the
particles are opposite to our observations. Nevertheless, we do not know if tar balls were present
in our field samples and if tar balls are extracted well by our solvent system (methanol-water).
Related, Hand et al. observed that some types of tar balls take up water above 75 % RH.48 In

contrast, Semeniuk et al., Adachi and Buseck, and Dusek et al. showed that some types of tar balls
are hydrophobic or only weakly hygroscopic.63,97,98 Overall, our results provide additional
evidence that field-collected BBOA can contain two phases. Moreover, our results illustrate that
the two phases can persist over a wide range of relative humidity values (∼95 to 0 % RH).

Comparison with previous BBOA viscosity measurements. As shown in Figure 3, our BBOA
field samples have higher viscosities under more humid conditions than several other BBOA
samples generated in the laboratory.34,35,42,43 Kiland et al. used poke-flow to measure the viscosity
of SOA made from the oxidation of BBOA-like phenolic compounds, as a proxy for biomass
burning SOA. Those samples were highly viscous and cracked at low RH, but their viscosities
decreased by an order of magnitude at 20% RH.42 Schnitzler et al. used poke-flow to measure the
viscosity of water-soluble extracts of primary BBOA generated in the lab from smoldering pine
wood. The water-soluble BBOA consistently had a viscosity lower than Kiland et al.’s SOA, and
far lower than the field samples herein.35

Gregson et al. used the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method to measure the
diffusion coefficients of fluorescent dyes in BBOA and then converted the results into the viscosity
of the hydrophobic phase and the hydrophilic phase of the BBOA. Gregson et al. reported
viscosities of about 102 Pa s at 30% RH and 293 K for both phases, estimated from the diffusion
coefficients measurements.34 This is far lower than our field BBOA.

Xu et al. reported the glass transition temperature and viscosity of unaged and aged BBOA
generated from the combustion of pine wood, poplar wood, cedar wood and cornstalk using
flaming conditions.43 Glass transition temperatures and viscosities were calculated from volatility
measurements, which assumes that the BBOA particles contained a single phase. At 35% RH and
298.15 K, the viscosities of those unaged samples ranged from 9.95×104 to 4.22×105 Pa s. After
aging using an OH exposure equivalent to 1.5 days in the atmosphere, the viscosities of the BBOA
from wood fuels increase by factors of 2.5 to 13. The viscosity of BBOA from burnt cornstalk was
halved after the same aging time. Nevertheless, even after aging, the viscosity of the laboratorygenerated BBOA was orders of magnitude less viscous than our field BBOA samples at 30-40%
RH.

The higher viscosities of our field samples are most likely due to a combination of factors. It could
be partially explained by oxidation, which is expected to lead to more polar compounds, higher
intermolecular forces, and therefore higher viscosities in the BBOA.90,99,100 However, Xu et al.’s
experiments show that on timescales relevant to our study, oxidation alone could not bring the
viscosity of BBOA to 2.5×108 Pa s. Such high viscosities could also be due to dilution in the
atmosphere prior to sampling. When smoke plumes are diluted, low molecular weight and low
polarity compounds can evaporate first, leaving behind larger, more polar, and hence more viscous
compounds.90,101 Recent experiments by Siemens et al. suggest that this dilution can cause an
increase in the viscosity of BBOA by up to 3 orders of magnitude.102 The differences in viscosities
could also be due to differences in burn conditions (i.e. flaming vs smoldering) or fuel type. Most
of the studies above burn a single wood or fuel type at a single temperature, while our field samples
contained BBOA from fires that would have been burning at different temperatures and a wide

effect of atmospheric oxidation, dilution, and burning conditions on BBOA viscosity.

In addition to the studies above, tar balls have been observed in a few laboratory studies using
electron microscopy.98,103,104 Tar balls have also been observed often in field-collected samples of
biomass burning smoke using electron microscopy. Studies show their number fractions increase
during the first 5 hours of aging but decrease at longer times.62,66,105 As discussed above, we do
not know if tar balls were present in our field samples and if tar balls are extracted well by our
solvent system (methanol-water). If tar balls were not extracted well by our solvent system, then
our results indicate the existence of a type of highly viscous non-tar ball BBOA.

a minimum or maximum value, respectively, for the viscosity of the aerosol under those conditions. The
grey shaded region represents the possible range of field sample BBOA viscosities. The poke-flow
experiments show the viscosity is ≥ 2.5×108 Pa s from 30-50%. Viscosities are also ≥ 2.5×108 Pa s at 0 to
30 % RH, since viscosity only increases as the RH decreases. Box plots in the bottom panel show the

The results herein show that BBOA, at least in regions where forests primarily consist of pine
trees, should be treated as having two separate phases. Depending on the degree of internal/external
mixing of BBOA in forest fire plumes, these two phases may coexist and be separated within
individual particles. This is without considering the mixing state of soot/black carbon (BC) with
BBOA in wildfire plumes, which can also have different degrees of internal and external mixing
and depends on the age of the plume.17,111,112 BC may be coated with a layer of BBOA, so if the
BBOA is phase-separated, it is possible to have BC cores engulfed in 2 distinct layers of BBOA.
In addition, BC in two-phased particles can preferentially partition into the lowest polarity phase
depending on coating thickness, which may modify the absorption of sunlight by BC.113,114

Phase separation in aerosols impacts the partitioning of species between the gas and particle phase.
If BBOA contain a single phase, then semivolatile organic compounds can partition into the entire
aerosol mass. On the other hand, if phase separation occurs, semivolatile organic compounds may
only partition into a portion of the aerosol mass, reducing the gas-to-particle partitioning of
semivolatile organic compounds. Therefore, models that assume single-phase BBOA may be
overestimating particle growth.55,115–119 Phase separation within individual particles can increase
the cloud condensation nucleation activity of organic aerosols by moving the lower surface tension
organics to the outside of the particle.32,92

To account for two phases in BBOA, atmospheric models could assume two phases and model
SVOCs partitioning only into the more polar phase. In addition, atmospheric models could assume
that the low polarity phase does not take up water, while the high polarity phase takes up water
with a given hygroscopicity. If phase separation occurs within individual particles, the outer low
polarity phase could form a complete or partial surface active organic monolayer, which enhances
cloud condensation nucleation activation, similar to the approaches in Ovadnevaite et al. and Ruehl
et al.33,120 Experiments are needed to test these speculations.

We found that both phases of Kamloops and Kelowna BBOA samples had viscosities ≥2.5×108
Pa s at relative humidities up to 50%. Based on a fractional Stokes-Einstein equation, a 200 nm
diameter BBOA particle would have a mixing time of ≥5.7 hours if the viscosity is ≥2.5×108 Pa s
(Supplementary Information S3).121

In Schnitzler et al. and Gregson et al., the viscosity of lab-generated BBOA was used to estimate
the lifetime of BrC due to ozonolysis.34,35 As BrC reacts with ozone, it can be “bleached” and lose
its absorptive properties, changing its impact on the climate.35,122 This process is slowed down
when BBOA/BrC is highly viscous, as it takes longer for ozone to diffuse into the aerosol. The
experiments here predict that BBOA in the field will be more viscous than reported by Schnitzler
et al. and Gregson et al. at RH values of 50% and below (Figure 3).34,35 Under conditions where
fresh lab-generated BBOA would be a liquid, the field sample BBOA would be a solid, and the

Most atmospheric models that treat biomass burning organic aerosols, and organic aerosols in
general, consider them as single-phased particles for gas-particle partitioning calculations.35,106–108
In addition, some models have treated primary organic aerosols and secondary organic aerosols as
two separate phases.109,110

lifetimes of processes like ozonolysis would be even longer than predicted in Schnitzler et al. and
in Gregson et al. This framework can be extended and applied to other reactions in BBOA that
have diffusion-limited kinetics.

Biomass burning events emit large amounts of primary BBOA and precursors of secondary
BBOA. After emission, the primary BBOA can partially evaporate and secondary BBOA can form
on and in the primary BBOA.58,107 A highly viscous BBOA, as observed here, could limit the rate
of evaporation of primary BBOA and the formation rate of secondary BBOA.123–128 A recent
modelling study that investigated the evolution of BBOA by evaporation of primary BBOA and
the formation of secondary BBOA assumed the BBOA was liquid-like with a diffusion coefficient
of 10-10 m2 s-1.107 Additional modelling studies are needed to determine the effect of highly viscous
BBOA on the evolution of BBOA in the atmosphere and the resulting impact on predicted BBOA
mass and composition.

The high viscosity may also have an impact on ice-cloud nucleation. Some studies have suggested
that glassy organic aerosol can act as heterogeneous nuclei for ice clouds.22,129–133 The forest fire
BBOA in this study was only highly viscous up to 50% RH at room temperature, but viscosity also
increases as temperatures get colder. Hence, the RH threshold at which cracking occurs will be
extended to higher RH values at higher, colder altitudes. In the upper troposphere, where
temperatures and RH values are often low,134 BBOA might often be in an amorphous solid (i.e.
glassy) state. Consistent with this speculation, previous studies have observed ice nucleation in
smoke plumes in the free troposphere.135 However, the nucleation of ice by glassy organic aerosol
is still an active area of debate with a recent study suggesting that ice nucleation by glassy organic
aerosol may be less important than previously suggested.136 Studies that focus on ice nucleation
by glassy BBOA are needed to resolve the importance of glassy BBOA for ice cloud formation in
the upper troposphere.

A caveat to the implications above is that the particles used in our work were 60 to 120 µm in
diameter, which is at least several times larger than atmospheric particles (approximately 10 nm
to 10 µm in diameter). Finite size effects can suppress liquid-liquid phase separation when the
diameter is ≲ 40 nm.137 In addition, finite size effects may sharply decrease viscosities of organic
aerosols when the diameter is ≲ 100 nm.138 Thus, we anticipate that our results apply to particles
larger than approximately 100 nm, which covers most of the mass of BBOA in the atmosphere,139–
141
but experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis.

The viscosity of our field samples was much higher than that of some previously measured labgenerated BBOA and BBOA proxies.34,35,42 Therefore, any BBOA studies using lab-generated
aerosols as proxies for wildfire BBOA should be mindful of these differences. It is, however, useful
to be able to make samples in the lab rather than collecting them in the field as it enables more
extensive studies of BBOA behaviour. Experiments as a function of aging, dilution, combustion
conditions, and fuel types should be done to bridge the gap between lab and field BBOA and to
develop methods for creating more realistic BBOA in the laboratory environment.
