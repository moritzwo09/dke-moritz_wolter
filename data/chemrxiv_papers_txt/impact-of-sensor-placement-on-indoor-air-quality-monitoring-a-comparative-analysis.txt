ABSTRACT: This study investigates the impact of sensor placement on the accuracy and responsiveness of indoor air
quality (IAQ) monitoring focusing on particulate matter concentrations. Measurements were conducted in a controlled
environment using three intercalibrated sensors positioned at different locations: a wall-mounted sensor installed at 1.2
meters above the ground, a sensor placed at the inlet of an air purifier, and a sensor located at breathing height in the
center of the room. A particle source was introduced at four different points within the room to simulate varying pollution
scenarios. The results revealed that the wall-mounted sensor exhibited delays of up to 200 seconds in detecting peak
pollutant concentrations compared to the sensor near the air purifier. Additionally, the wall-mounted sensor consistently
recorded lower pollutant levels compared to the other two sensors. The findings underscore the critical importance of
strategic sensor placement for accurate and real-time IAQ monitoring. Placing sensors closer to breathing zones and
pollution sources provides data that more accurately reflects human exposure risks. The study concludes that
wall-mounted sensors may not provide real-time air quality data in dynamic indoor environments. Further research,
including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, is recommended to optimize sensor placement strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Indoor air quality (IAQ) is a critical component of public
health, affecting productivity, comfort, and well-being.
Poor IAQ can result in significant health impacts such as
respiratory diseases, headaches, fatigue, allergies, and
cognitive impairment. These issues are exacerbated by
the fact that modern humans spend the majority of their
time indoors. Indoor air pollution levels are often two to
five times higher than outdoor air due to confined spaces
and sources like furniture, electronics, and human
emissions (1).
The increasing awareness of the adverse health
effects of air pollutants has driven the need to monitor
indoor air quality status. Indoor sensors are
indispensable for IAQ monitoring because they provide
continuous and real-time data, ensuring that indoor
spaces remain safe and comfortable, especially in
commercial and public buildings where large numbers of
people are present (2). Advances in sensor technology
have enabled the development of low-cost, highly
sensitive devices capable of detecting various air
pollutants (3). Accurate sensor readings are essential for
maintaining healthy indoor environments and provide
practical guidelines to adjust HVAC systems and their
energy use (4,5). However, the accuracy of IAQ sensors
is highly dependent on their placement within a space,
as environmental factors, airflow patterns, and other

variables can significantly affect sensor performance.
Hence, the strategic positioning of sensors plays a
critical role in ensuring accurate and real-time IAQ data
collection (4).
Studies have shown that improper sensor placement
can lead to data inaccuracies, which may compromise
the overall IAQ monitoring strategy (3,5). For example,
placing a sensor too close to a pollution source or an air
vent can result in over- or under-estimation of pollutant
concentrations.
Related studies:
Yun & Licina (4) explored the importance of
strategically placing stationary air quality sensors in
office environments to monitor better personal exposure
to pollutants like CO2, PM2.5, and PM10. Controlled
experiments found that proximity to occupants and
ventilation strategies significantly influence exposure
detection accuracy. They showed placements near the
occupant's breathing zone, can improve the prediction of
inhalation exposure, especially during different activity
levels. Rackes et al. (3) simulated the impacts of the
placement of CO2 and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) sensors, their accuracy, and the numbers
required for effective IAQ monitoring in four typical
offices. The spatial variation of concentrations for both
sensors was not large, (standard deviation CO2= 3–10%
and VOCs= 21% when its emissions sources were highly
variable across the space). Errors due to sensor

accuracy were found to be more significant than the
spatial distribution of sensors, suggesting that improving
sensor quality is more critical than increasing the number
of sensors. Azizi et al. (5) examined the effects of 18
bundled multi-sensor devices (CO2 and passive infrared
(PIR) radiation) positioned in three single-occupant
offices (six sensors in each office) on the sensor data.
They found the PIR sensors on the ceiling resulted in
unreliable data, with 60% accuracy. Installing sensors
under office desks can boost accuracy to 84%. Filios et
al. (6) focused on using virtual sensing and machine
learning techniques to continuously adjust gas sensor
locations in two indoor settings (with HVAC and naturally
ventilated room). The method reduced the need for
excess hardware and improved real-time air quality
assessment by predicting less valuable sensor data.
Their results demonstrated that improvements in data
coverage and machine learning inputs could enhance
prediction accuracy. Xiang et al. (7) proposed a hybrid
network combining stationary sensors for accuracy and
mobile sensors for coverage. Using pollutant prediction
models, their approach reduces network error by 40.4%
and improves exposure measurement accuracy by
35.8% compared to stationary networks. Borodinecs et
al. (2) evaluated the importance of proper ventilation in
ensuring accurate CO2 sensor measurements in indoor
spaces and found the sensors perform reliably in
mechanically ventilated buildings, but inaccuracies in
naturally ventilated spaces, particularly where room
occupancy fluctuates. Cheng et al. (8) optimized
temperature and CO2 sensor placement for multi-zone
thermal comfort and IAQ monitoring using building
information modeling (BIM), computational fluid
dynamics (CFD), and genetic algorithms (GA). The study
emphasizes that traditional sensor placement guidelines
are insufficient for capturing critical spatial variations,
and more sensors, especially in areas like corridors
without HVAC systems, are needed to enhance thermal
comfort and indoor air quality.
Despite the growing attention to IAQ monitoring, there
is still a lack of studies that explore the placement of
sensors indoors in conjunction with simulation surveys.
To our knowledge, only three studies (2,4,5) have
experimentally investigated this topic. By combining
experimental data, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations, and advanced optimization algorithms, this
study provided new insights to this extent. We evaluated
the effect of positioning of particle and gas sensors (total
VOCs) on their accuracy and reliability in different office
settings. The CFD method has become one of the most
used tools in optimizing the placement of IAQ sensors.
By simulating different airflow conditions, CFD models
can identify zones where pollutant concentrations are
likely to be higher or lower, guiding the placement of
sensors for more accurate measurements. This is
particularly important for particle sensors, as particulate
matter follows complex airflow paths, often settling in
areas that are not immediately obvious (8). Furthermore,
CFD models can simulate the impact of various factors
such as ventilation rates, temperature gradients, and

occupant movement on indoor pollutant distribution. This
allows for more precise sensor placement, ensuring that
the sensors capture a representative sample of the
indoor air environment (9). Bulot et al. have investigated
the performance of the sensor elements themselves,
including their accuracy for different particle types.
Significantly they find that certain sensors have a
significant time delay, up to 90 s, built into the device
(10).
One could characterize error in terms of a time delay
between the change of concentration in the breathing
zone and the measurement point. Another error would
be if there was a constant offset in concentration, for
example, if the sensor was placed next to a source of
pollution or clean air. Both types of error will be
discussed in this article. To better understand the
question of sensor placement we carried out a study in
which sensors were placed at different locations.
Several guidelines have been set in place for IAQ
monitoring. They mostly include placing the monitors in
the height of a typical breathing zone and away from
openable doors and windows. The US EPA guide states
that the ideal placement would be at a height of 0.9 – 1.8
m and away from pollution sources and sinks. Rapid
changes in temperature and relative humidity should be
avoided near the sensors and one should make sure the
sensors are not tucked away behind furniture(11).

Materials and Methods
Study Environment and Data Collection
The study was conducted in a controlled environment—a
sealed room with a volume of approximately 82.2 m³,
located at the H. C. Ørsted Institute at the University of
Copenhagen. FIGURE 1 shows the setup room. The room
was undisturbed during the study, and baseline conditions
were recorded before air purifier activation. PM1 and PM2.5
concentrations were measured using time-stamped
readings at regular intervals. Sensors were first placed 1 cm
apart to correlate proximity and were intercalibrated
according to the results.

Results and Discussion
Three intercalibrated particulate matter sensors were used
to count particle concentrations simultaneously. The
locations of the sensors are highlighted by the red circles in
FIGURE 2.
- Wall-mounted sensor: Installed at a standard height of 1.2
meters above the ground for monitoring air quality.
- Device sensor: Placed at the inlet of an air purifier, where
real-time air quality data is expected to reflect conditions as
air enters the device for filtration.

PM1 and PM2.5 Concentration
The background numbers were very similar for all three
sensors. After a few minutes to record the background, the
particles were released at point 1. FIGURE 4 shows the
particle concentrations at the three locations when the
pollution source was placed at Point 1. The device and
center sensors showed more similar readings than the
wall-mounted sensor. The horizontal axis shows time in
minutes.

- Center sensor: Placed at breathing level in the room
center.

FIGURE 2. Locations of the sensors

The particle sources (incense) were placed at four different
points 1, 2, 3, and 4 as shown in FIGURE 3.

All three sensors showed similar numbers where the
particle source was placed at Point 2, as shown in FIGURE
5. However, the device sensor is still more aligned with the
center sensor. The horizontal axis shows time in minutes.

Data were analyzed by comparing the PM1 and PM2.5
concentration trends between the wall-mounted, center, and
device sensors. Delays between sensors were noted,
particularly between the wall-mounted and center sensors.

staying away from the polluted area. Device sensors,
placed at the inlet of air purifiers, offer a better solution for
immediate tracking of air quality and pollutant levels.
Two main phenomena cause on dispersion of pollutants in
the air. One is diffusion and the other is turbulence. The
turbulence effect is minimal near the walls, due to the
boundary layers. This effect can be seen here as well for
the wall sensor. The pollutants that can reach the sensor at
the wall are less than the pollutants at the center and the
device. After several minutes all sensors show similar
numbers since the mixing happens during this time. The air
purifier fan adds turbulence to the room which helps to have
mixing. More CFD simulation studies can be done to
scrutinize this condition.
FIGURE 6. Measured particle concentrations (µg/m³) by the
three sensors at Point 3
The concentrations when the particle source is at Point 4
are shown in FIGURE 7. The device and the center sensor
showed a pick of around 15 µg/m³, while the wall sensor
shows a pick of about 5 µg/m³, i.e. one-third of the exposed
concentration.

A room is not a well-mixed reactor and concentrations will
vary depending on the location of pollution sources and
ventilation. But the concentration in the breathing zone is
the most important concentration to be determined
accurately, since this is directly linked to pollution exposure.
These results indicate that future IAQ monitoring systems
must carefully consider the location of sensors to ensure
timely and accurate pollutant detection. Placing sensors, far
from the walls, closer to breathing zones and pollutant
sources yields data that more accurately reflects human
exposure risks.

Conclusion

Discussion
The study’s findings underscore the critical importance of
sensor placement in IAQ monitoring. Although useful for
long-term installations, wall-mounted sensors may not
provide real-time sensitivity in environments with rapidly
changing air quality. The wall-mounted sensor shows both
concentration differences and time delay regarding the
particle concentrations. All measurements show more than
a 30% discrepancy between the peaks of the wall sensor
maximum numbers and the maximum numbers of the two
other sensors, except for Point 2 measurement, where the
point source is near the center of the room.
The peak concentration of the wall sensor, when the particle
source was at Point 4, had a delay of more than three
minutes. Detecting pollution fast results in reacting fast to
remove the pollution by removing the pollution source, using
a local air purifier, using the central ventilation system, or

This study highlights significant differences in air quality
data obtained from wall-mounted and device sensors. The
findings suggest that the sensor placed at the inlet of the air
purifier provides more accurate and immediate readings,
particularly in environments with fluctuating air quality. In
contrast, the wall-mounted sensor may introduce delays,
reducing their effectiveness for real-time monitoring. These
results have important implications for designing indoor air
quality monitoring systems, where sensor placement should
be prioritized to ensure accurate assessments of human
exposure to pollutants. More studies are needed to visualize
the relationship between the concentrations of wall-mounted
particle sensors, ventilation exhaust sensors, and the
sensor placed at a local air purifier inlet. This could be done
by using CFD simulations.
