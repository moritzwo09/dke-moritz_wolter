Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are an important group of elements both geologically and economically. The ability of hydrothermal fluids to mobilize REEs in natural, ore-forming environments
depends on the chemical composition and the presence of suitable ligands such as chloride and fluoride. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the molecular structure and
thermodynamic stability of La3+ species in Cl-bearing hydrothermal fluids. We develop a new
polarizable force field for this system optimized by reference to density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The structural and thermodynamic data obtained with the new potential using the
well-tempered metadynamics (WMetaD) technique reproduce experimental and ab initio MD simulation data well. Polarization effects are shown to be essential for predicting realistic association
and stability constants, which was not achieved with simpler non-polarizable interaction potentials.
Simulations with different box sizes indicate that the effects of simulation box sizes on calculated
thermodynamic quantities are almost negligible at high temperatures.

1. Introduction

Rare earth elements (REEs) are a group of 17 (including scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y)) silvery-

white heavy metals. Compounds containing REEs have immense applications in electronic and

electrical equipments, lasers, glass, semiconductors and magnetic materials. Due to their increasing

importance in economic developments and potential of their supplies being at risk [1, 2], they have

6

been classified as critical elements by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

7

Hydrothermal processes control the mineralogy and grade distribution of several important REE

8

deposits, such as Gallinas Mountain in New Mexico [3] or Thor Lake in Canada [4]. The mobility of

9

elements in hydrothermal fluids is primarily controlled by the chemical composition and speciation,

10

which have been shown to be controlled by temperature and pressure [5]. Commonly formed REE

11

complexes include carbonates, sulfates, fluorides and chlorides [6, 7]. Therefore, accurate knowledge

12

of the speciation of REEs in dilute to concentrated hydrothermal brines is necessary to improve

13

existing geochemical models and to complement existing mineral recovery and extraction processes.

14

Lanthanum (La), which is classified as a light rare earth element (LREE), is generally enriched by

15

hydrothermal processes that form primary ore deposits. Several minerals like bastnasite, monazite,

16

zircon and apatite are important sources of REEs in such deposits [8]. Although LREEs form

17

stronger complexes with F− with increasing temperature, Cl− is considered to be the main transport

18

ligand of LREEs mainly because of its much higher availability in hydrothermal fluids [9]. Several

19

experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to determine the properties of La3+ aqua

20

and chloride complexes at room temperature (Table 1 in Guan et al. [9]). Experimental and

21

molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] have shown that the

22

hydration structure of La3+ at room temperature is a tricapped trigonal prism with nine water

23

molecules. Weak chloride complexation was found by Raman spectroscopy in LaCl3 solutions with a

24

solute concentration above 0.1 mol/kg [18], which was confirmed by AIMD simulations [19]. Petit et

25

al. [20] used a combination of pair potential-based MD and AIMD simulations and found an average

26

3+
configuration of La(H2 O)8 Cl−
2 in concentrated 14 mol/kg solutions. However, fully hydrated La

27

complexes were seen in 1 mol/kg solutions [17].

28

Although aqueous lanthanum chloride solutions have been well studied at room temperature

29

[17, 20, 19, 18], studies targeting hydrothermal temperatures and pressures are quite scarce in

30

available literature. In the absence of experiments at high temperatures, earlier studies relied on

31

extrapolations of room temperature data using a species-based equation of state (EOS), such as the

32

Helgeson- Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) model [21]. Haas et al. [22] fitted a set of parameters for the

33

HKF model at 25 ◦ C, 1 bar. Mayanovic et al. [23] performed in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy

34

(XAS) of La3+ in Cl-bearing solutions up to 500 ◦ C. They predicted a gradual increase in chloride

35

complexation from zero at 25 ◦ C to 3.1 at 500 ◦ C. Migdisov et al. [24] performed high-temperature

36

solubility experiments and published a set of HKF parameters that can be used up to 300 ◦ C. As

37

far as computational studies are concerned, Guan et al. [9] is the only study available in literature.

38

They performed AIMD simulations up to 500 ◦ C and reported speciation and association constants

39

in a wide range of temperatures, pressures and concentrations.

40

As the forces between atoms in AIMD simulations are calculated by electronic structure methods,

41

usually within DFT, such simulations require extremely large computational resources. Parameter-

42

ized force fields are much more efficient and can overcome some of the shortcomings of AIMD while

43

still providing sufficient geochemical insights into fluid properties at hydrothermal conditions [25].

44

However, an accurate description of ionic and molecular interactions requires an analytical model

45

with sufficient chemical complexity. The explicit account of polarizability becomes particularly

46

important when dealing with highly charged ions having high polarization power in concentrated

47

solutions [26]. Many different polarizable force fields exist, each having a different representation of

48

polarizability [27, 28, 29], but none of them for the system and the thermodynamic conditions of

49

interest here.

50

In this paper, we fit an ab initio-based polarizable ion model (PIM) for the LaCl3 -H2 O system.

51

We use the new potential to study the speciation of La3+ and derive association constants of different

52

La-Cl complexes in dilute to concentrated brines at two different hydrothermal conditions. To

53

understand the importance of ionic polarizability, a comparative study is performed with a non-

54

polarizable pair potential [12]. The results are also compared to available AIMD and experimental

55

data, where available.

56

2. Methods

57

2.1. Polarizable ion model

58

The PIM describes the interactions between the charged particles of the system and has been

59

used in previous studies [26, 30, 31], so we only summarize its functional form here. The total

60

potential energy Vtotal of the system comprises four terms:
Vtotal = Vcharge + Vdisp + Vrep + Vpol

61

(1)

The Vcharge term is calculated between ion pairs I and J from Coulomb’s law
Vcharge =

X qI qJ
I,J

rIJ

(2)

62

where qI , qJ are the charges of ions I and J and rIJ is the distance between the ions. Ions are

63

treated as rigid particles with fixed formal charges of +3 for La and -1 for Cl. The Vdisp term

with two parameters AIJ and B IJ as

70

Finally, the polarization energy Vpol many-body electrostatic effects are described by the induced

71

dipole (µ⃗I ) terms. These are treated as additional degrees of freedom and obtained at each MD step

72

by minimizing the polarization energy,

75

has m = 4.

76

The solvent water molecules are described by the polarizable model described by Dang and

77

Chang (DC) [29], which is compatible with PIM. DC water is a rigid 4-site rigid model, with an

78

additional virtual site M along the symmetry axis of the molecule, which carries a negative partial

79

charge and the induced dipole. The short range repulsion and dispersion interactions are described

80

by Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction on the oxygen atom only. The parameters of the DC model are

81

summarized in Table 1. The functional form of the water potential is included in the SI. This model

82

has been shown to correctly reproduce the trends in several thermophysical properties of bulk water

83

from ambient to high temperature conditions [34].

2.2. Potential parameter optimization

85

The PIM potential parameters are determined sequentially. First, we derive the ionic polarizabil-

86

ity (αI in Equation 6) of La3+ and Cl− ions. For La3+ , DFT calculations are done with an isolated

87

gas phase cation. The dipole induced on the cation by an electric field perturbation is analyzed

88

by constructing maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) using the method by Molina et

89

al.[30]. Since the effect of the coordination environment on the polarizability of anions is significant

90

[31, 30], αI of Cl− ion is determined from analogous simulations of the solvated anion with box #3

91

in Table 2.

92

To determine the other adjustable potential parameters, the LaCl3 -H2 O system is split into 3 dif-

93

ferent subsystems: crystalline LaCl3 to determine the La-La, La-Cl and Cl-Cl potential parameters,

94

hydrated La3+ in liquid water to determine the La-O potential parameters and hydrated Cl− in liq-

95

uid water to determine the Cl-O potential parameters, both at 773 K, 5 kbar. The simulation boxes

96

used for simulations of the individual subsystems are listed in Table 2 (boxes #1 to #3). AIMD

97

simulations are performed for each of the subsystems with the PBE exchange and correlation (XC)

98

functional [35] to generate structural configurations that are used as training set for the subsequent

99

dipole and force fitting. For each configuration, MLWFs and atomic forces are computed. MLWFs

100

are used to calculate the dispersion interaction terms (C6IJ and C8IJ in Equation 3) and ionic or

101

molecular dipole moments. More technical details about the DFT-related and AIMD simulations

102

and derived properties are given in the SI.

103

In a next step, the DFT-derived dipole moments are used to determine the short-range damping

104

IJ
parameters of Vpol , bIJ
pol and cpol , using a dipole fitting approach [26, 36]. They are optimized to

105

minimize the difference between dipole moments calculated from PIM and those obtained from DFT

Finally, the parameters of the short-range repulsion term (Vrep ) and bIJ

111

following a similar procedure [26, 36] by fitting the forces calculated from PIM to those obtained

116

al.[26].

117

2.3. MD simulations

118

The fitted PIM potential is used to investigate the speciation and association constants of La-Cl

119

complexes at 773 K and 5 kbar. The simulation boxes used to study speciation and thermodynamics

120

are compiled in Table 2 (boxes #4 to #7). The edge lengths of the boxes are adjusted to match the

121

densities obtained from EOS in Driesner et al. [37]. To prepare those boxes, first a box containing

122

only water molecules is equilibrated at a density of ∼0.8 g/cm3 with the SPC/E water model [38].

123

Boxes #4 and #7 are prepared by replacing some of the water molecules with a geometry-optimized

124

LaCl3 molecule.

125

MD simulations are performed in the N V T ensemble, that is, with a constant number of particles,

126

N , volume, V and temperature, T , and with a time step of 0.5 fs. After initial equilibration, the

127

simulations are run for approximately 5 ns. To compare the fitted PIM potential against available

128

non-polarizable force fields, MD simulations are carried out with the same boxes using the pair

129

potential reported in Migliorati et al. [12] and Smith and Dang [39], referred to as N-POL in

130

the following. Details of the N-POL potential are described in Table S2. These potentials have

131

been shown to accurately predict the structural and thermodynamic properties of aqueous La3+

132

at ambient conditions [12, 40]. To check the transferability of the PIM potential to subcritical

133

conditions, additional MD simulations are performed at 473 K and 400 bar. This temperature and

134

pressure are chosen to ensure solvent densities similar to the training set and to facilitate direct

135

comparison with AIMD data from Guan et al. [9].

136

137

Structural analysis of the MD trajectories is done by computing partial radial distribution functions, gIJ (r), for different pairs of species I and J using the TRAVIS code [41]

gIJ (r) =
138

139

D

E
dnIJ
r
4πr2 ρJ dr

(9)

where dnIJ
r is a function calculating the number of particles of type J within a shell of thickness

dr at a distance r from a particle of type I. ρJ is the number density NJ /V of species J. The

140

angular brackets denote ensemble average over the entire trajectory. Coordination numbers (CN)

141

are calculated by counting the number of particles up to the first minimum of the respective gIJ (r).

142

In order to calculate the association constants of different La-Cl complexes, well-tempered meta-

143

dynamics (WMetaD) [42, 43] simulations are performed in the N V T ensemble for ∼6 ns. Hills of

144

height 1 kJ/mol and width 0.02 are deposited every 102 timesteps to get a good sampling of the

145

associated and dissociated states within a reasonable simulation time. To allow a direct comparison

146

with the AIMD data from Guan et al. [9] at their studied conditions, boxes #5 and #6 in Table

147

2 are used for these simulations. WMetaD simulations are also performed with boxes #4 and #7

148

to study the effects of box size on the association constant. These simulations are conducted using

149

the PLUMED package together with the CP2K code [44]. Association constants are obtained from

150

the free energy surface (FES) using the method described by Chialvo et al. [45]. More details of

151

this method are provided in the SI. The integration cutoff of the radial distribution function, rc in

152

Equation S11 is taken as half of the edge length of the respective simulation boxes, i.e. ∼6.10-6.30 Å

153

for boxes #5 and #6 and ∼10.00-10.80 Å for boxes #4 and #7 (see Table 2). ri in the same equation

154

is set to ∼2.8 Å in all biased simulations corresponding to the distance of the first minimum in FES.

3. Results

156

3.1. PIM parameters

157

The ionic polarizability values of the La3+ and Cl− ions obtained from the DFT simulations are

158

listed in Table 3. These values agree well with previously calculated polarizability values for these

159

ions [30, 46, 47]. The other PIM parameters obtained with the methods described above are given in

160

Table 4. The MSEs obtained for forces and dipole moments of the different subsystems are listed in

161

Table S3. Plots comparing fitted and computed dipole moments and forces for different subsystems

162

are shown in Figures S3-S8.

163

3.2. Speciation and structure

164

To test the performance of the new PIM potential, we first compare structural data from PIM

165

and AIMD simulations using the boxes used as training sets. The calculated bond lengths and

166

coordination numbers from the PIM agree well with the AIMD data as shown in Table 5. For

167

La-Cl, the AIMD data from Guan et al. [9] are used as a reference. Note that the latter study was

168

performed with a different DFT exchange-correlation functional.

Next, La-Cl radial distribution functions, gLaCl (r), from PIM, N-POL and AIMD are compared

170

in Figure 1. While the PIM data reproduce the AIMD results reasonably well, N-POL MD predicts

171

strong La-Cl attraction that allows only negligible ion exchange throughout the simulation. This

172

point is illustrated and discussed in greater detail later. La-O and Cl-O pair correlation functions

173

from AIMD and PIM are shown in Figure S9. Both models predict similar sizes and overall structures

174

of the hydration shells.

175

The predictions of ion pair distances and coordination numbers from PIM and N-POL MD at

176

both conditions are listed in Table 6 and compared to AIMD data. gLaCl (r) and gLaO (r) obtained at

177

773 K and 473 K from box #4 with both the models are shown in Figures S10 and S11 respectively.

178

For both conditions, N-POL predicts longer La-Cl and La-O distances as compared to PIM.

179

The number of nearest neighbors of the La3+ ion is ∼7 for PIM, while it is ∼8 for N-POL MD at

180

supercritical conditions. At subcritical conditions, the total CN is ∼8 for PIM, while it is ∼9 for

181

N-POL MD. In contrast to PIM, N-POL MD shows almost no La-Cl dissociation, resulting in high

182

CN at both conditions. This is reflected by sharp high peaks in gLaCl (r) at ∼2.8 Å in Figures S10

183

and S11 (left). At 473 K, PIM predicts an almost completely hydrated La3+ ion with ∼8 water

185

characterized by a narrow low peak at ∼2.8 Å and a broad peak at ∼5.0 Å. These two peaks indicate

186

the formation of two different types of ion pairs, contact ion pairs (CIPs) and solvent-shared ion

187

pairs (SShIPs).

al. [9] is used to recalculate log Keq
for the AIMD reference in Table 7 using the method described

in the SI. Making these corrections leads to a maximum difference of about one log unit in log Keq

193

of the studied reactions. To make a credible comparison, PIM association constants obtained from

194

the small simulation boxes are compared with the AIMD data. The effects of box size are discussed

195

subsequently. La-Cl complexes show step-wise association reactions as
LaCln−14−n + Cl− −−→ LaCln3−n

The reactions for successive values of n starting from n = 1 in Equation 10 are referred to as reactions

197

1, 2 and 3 respectively in the remaining paper.

198

Energy barriers for dissociation are approximated by ∆G between the first energy maximum and

199

the first energy minimum in the FES, whereas relative stabilities of different metastable states are

200

determined as free energy differences between them as shown in Figure 2 (right). It is to be noted

201

that since the MD simulations are performed in the N V T ensemble, the free energies obtained with

202

the biased simulations are the Helmholtz free energies. However, as shown in Schulze et al. [48], the

203

change in volume due to the addition of an associated ion pair or a dissociated ion pair is negligibly

205

free energies can be considered to be approximately equal to the Gibbs free energies.

206

WMetaD is performed with the La-Cl interionic distance of the dissociating Cl− as the collective

207

variable (CV). The other Cl− ligands are prevented from dissociating or associating by restraining

208

them to a fixed distance either close to or far away from the La3+ ion. For example, in case of

209

reaction 2, one Cl− ligand is restrained at ∼3 Å, the other is allowed to associate while the third

210

one (to be associated in the next step) is restrained at ∼8-10 Å. This is illustrated in Figure 2 (left,

211

inset). In dilute solutions ions generally exist in equilibrium as contact ion pairs (CIPs - ion pairs

212

where anion and cation are in close contact), solvent-shared ion pairs (SShIPs - ion pairs where

213

anion and cation share hydration water molecules) and solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs - ion pairs

214

where anion and cation form their individual hydration shells) as shown in Figure 3. These can be

216

of all the metastable states.

of CIPs and SSIPs, red balls represent hydration water molecules of La3+ , and magenta balls represent hydration

217

Figure 2 shows the FES of reaction 2 obtained from PIM and N-POL MD at supercritical and

218

subcritical conditions. FES for the other reactions are shown in Figures S12 and S13. All FES

219

primarily show two metastable states indicated by energy minima at ∼3 Å and at ∼5 Å (marked by

220

1 and 2 in Figure 2 right). State 1 is attributed to the CIPs whereas state 2 is populated by SShIPs

221

and these metastable states are separated by a high-energy transition state (TS). Relative stabilities

222

of CIPs and SShIPs show a change from subcritical to supercritical conditions with PIM. However,

223

no such change in relative stability is observed with N-POL MD. ∆G2−1 obtained from the different

224

models at 773 K and 473 K is shown in Figure S14.

225

In Table 7, high values of the energy barrier for dissociation can be seen compared to the thermal

226

energy, kB T. This creates a kinetic bottleneck in unbiased simulations, which underlines the moti-

227

vation to use WMetaD for this system. Further, it can be inferred that PIM predicts lower energy

228

barriers for dissociation compared to those from N-POL MD for all reactions at subcritical as well

229

as supercritical conditions. PIM predicts increasing energy barriers for successive dissociation reac-

230

tions at both conditions. N-POL MD predicts almost constant energy barriers at 773 K. At 473 K,

231

an increase in energy barrier from reaction 1 to 2 followed by a decrease in reaction 3 is observed.

232

∞
Both models predict positive values of log Keq
for all the stepwise association reactions due to

233

the tendency of ions to associate in water at high temperatures. In general, the calculated values of

234

∞
log Keq
for PIM are lower than those for N-POL MD for all association reactions at subcritical and

235

supercritical conditions. This is because of the deep energy basins predicted by N-POL MD for CIPs,

which make them more exothermic than those from PIM. Both models show an increase in log Keq

4. Discussion

241

4.1. Speciation and structure: Comparison with available AIMD and experimental data

242

The new PIM potential predicts La-Cl bond distances closer to AIMD data compared to N-POL

243

MD (Table 6) at both conditions studied here. However, distances from both PIM and N-POL MD

14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-h5v4s ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0008-3812-3731 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

244

are shorter than the 2.90-3.02 Å range predicted by experiments at similar conditions [9]. Shorter

245

bond lengths from PIM are a consequence of shorter bond lengths predicted by DFT which is used

246

to generate the training configurations. Both models predict a decrease in La-Cl bond length with

247

increasing temperature, which is consistent with experiments [9] and AIMD [9] at similar conditions.

248

N-POL MD simulations with box #4 at both conditions show almost no La-Cl dissociation resulting

249

in CN > 2. The presence of high-energy barriers for dissociation (∼7 kB T, Table 7) at both conditions

250

is the reason why La-Cl dissociation is kinetically unfavorable in N-POL MD. Similar conclusions

251

were drawn by Zhang and Yan [49] with a different set of pair potentials at similar temperature

252

conditions. As the existing N-POL potentials were optimized to reproduce structures at ambient

253

conditions, we attempted to refit the LJ potential from Migliorati et al. [12] with atomic force

254

data at supercritical conditions. However, this refitted potential also predicted unfavourable La-Cl

255

dissociation. The observed inability of LJ-type potentials to predict the hydration free energies and

256

ion-oxygen distances of divalent cations was already addressed by Li et al.[50], who attributed this

257

behavior to the lack of ion-dipole interactions. These problems are overcome with PIM, which softens

258

the La-Cl interactions resulting in significant dissociation at both conditions, consistent with AIMD

259

simulations and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data [9] at similar conditions.

260

At 473 K, ∆G2−1 is negative for PIM reactions (Figure S14), which means that SShIP is the more

261

stable state compared to CIP. This is also seen in the unbiased simulations (PIM with box #4, Table

262

6) where almost all Cl− ligands preferentially populate the second coordination shell at a distance

263

of ∼5 Å. La-O distances from PIM are shorter compared to those from EXAFS data [9] at similar

264

conditions.

265

Figure 4 shows a comparison of the total number of ligands and the number of Cl− ligands in

266

the first coordination shell. With increasing temperature, the static dielectric constant of water

267

decreases, which promotes ion association. This effect is seen in PIM where an increase of about

268

one Cl− ion is observed from subcritical to supercritical conditions, consistent with AIMD data

269

[9], EXAFS studies [9], XAS studies [23] and HKF model data [6]. N-POL MD predicts higher

270

Cl− coordination and negligible change with temperature. In terms of the absolute number of Cl−

271

ligands, the PIM data agrees well with the HKF model [6] generated using solubility data from

272

Migdisov et al. [24] and EXAFS data [9], whereas an overestimation of about one ligand is observed

273

for N-POL MD. With decreasing temperature, PIM shows an increase in the total number of ligands

274

of about one, in agreement with EXAFS data [9]. XAS data [23] predict an increase of about

275

three ligands. However, XAS generally overestimates coordination numbers indicated by the 10-fold

coordinated La3+ predicted at subcritical conditions [23]. N-POL MD predicts negligible change in

277

the total number of ligands with temperature. In terms of the absolute number of ligands in the

278

first coordination shell, PIM data agree well with EXAFS [9] and AIMD [9] data, while N-POL MD

279

overestimates the number of ligands by about one. PIM also shows better agreement with XAS

280

studies [23] in terms of the total number of ligands compared to N-POL MD at 773 K. In general,

281

La-O distances predicted by PIM are shorter than those in AIMD and experiments [9] at similar

282

conditions.

In general, association constants predicted by AIMD, N-POL MD and PIM follow the order,

−P OL > log Keq,P IM > log Keq,AIM D . This is seen in Table 7 and also illustrated in Figure

286

S15. Although PIM gives better log Keq
values as compared to N-POL, the disagreement with AIMD

287

is still relatively large, i.e. about one log unit in some cases. Table 8 shows the cumulative association

288

constants, log β obtained from N-POL MD, PIM, AIMD [9] and the HKF model parameterized with

289

solubility data from Migdisov et al. [24] up to ∼350 ◦ C. They are obtained by cumulative addition

290

of log Keq
values shown in Table 7 and, hence, follow the same descending order as association

291

constants. log β predicted by PIM for reactions 2 and 3 at 473 K are in better agreement with the

292

thermodynamic model and AIMD than N-POL MD. Both models predict an increase in log β values

293

of LaCl2+ and LaCl+

up to ∼400 ◦ C [24] and with AIMD data [9]. Due to the increased stability of La-Cl complexes at

more exothermic at higher temperatures.

SShIPs as the more stable state at 473 K in contrast to N-POL MD that always predicts CIPs as the

302

conditions. Absolute values of ∆G2−1 from PIM are generally lower than those from AIMD.

303

From Table 8, it may seem that PIM and N-POL MD are more accurate than AIMD in predicting

304

formation constants. However, we do not draw such conclusions here because formation constants

305

are derived from the corresponding reaction FES. As discussed above, FES from N-POL MD are

306

unable to predict the relative stabilities of the different metastable states correctly. We do not have

307

any data to prove that FES from PIM are more accurate than their AIMD counterparts.

308

4.2.1. Effect of box size on association constant

309

MD simulations use periodic boundary conditions to replicate bulk liquid systems. The success

310

of this assumption depends on the size of the simulation box which determines the distance between

311

the particles and their nearest images. A small simulation box would mean smaller distances between

312

particles and their periodic images leading to higher interactions between them, which is not desirable

313

as this imposes correlations not expected in fluids. To understand the effect of box size on the

314

∞
calculated values of log Keq
and energy barriers, WMetaD simulations were performed with boxes

315

#4 and #7 in Table 2 with the new PIM potential. The results are presented in Figure 5.

316

Figure 5 shows minor disagreements (maximum difference of ∼0.9 kB T in energy barriers and

317

∼0.25 log units in association constants) between results from the two simulation boxes. The tech-

318

nique used to calculate the association constants in this work boils down to calculating g ∞ (r), which
18

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-h5v4s ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0008-3812-3731 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

319

is the radial distribution function in the limit of infinite dilution. For highly dilute solutions, ob-

320

taining g ∞ (r) from MD simulations is difficult as sampling deficiency occurs due to rather short

321

simulation times, leading to poor statistics. Therefore, the more practical way is to calculate g ∞ (r)

322

from ∆G obtained from biased simulations using Equation S12. If it were possible to simulate a

323

’theoretically’ infinitely dilute solution (the simulation box is big enough with adequate number of

324

water molecules and La, Cl particles to reach bulk behavior), g ∞ (r) would converge to 1 and hence

325

ϕ(r) would converge to 0 at r → ∞, which is the dissociated state in the ideal case. However, due

326

to extreme long-range nature of Coulomb interactions and limited number of La, Cl particles, this is

327

difficult to achieve even in simulation boxes with edge lengths of ∼30 Å [51]. Hence, the dissociated

328

state is taken to be the limiting continuum behavior where charged particles interact via screened

329

Coulomb interaction given by ϕanalytical (r) = −q 2 /4πϵ0 ϵr r. FES obtained from simulation boxes

330

of different sizes are rigidly shifted so that their tails coincide with the analytical solution at long

331

∞
distances, as shown in Figure 6. The difference in the log Keq
values arise due to the difference in

332

length of the tail coinciding with the analytical solution. However, once the FES is properly aligned

333

to the analytical solution (indicating efficient sampling of all the metastable states), dependence of

334

∞
on cutoff distance is weak beyond ∼5 Å (corresponding to SShIP) at high temperatures, as
log Keq

335

shown in Figure S16. Therefore, results obtained from small simulation boxes used in AIMD sim-

336

ulations are acceptable at these conditions. The effect of box size may become important at lower

337

temperatures where SSIPs are stabilized in addition to CIPs and SShIPs. Since SSIPs are formed

338

at ∼7.5 Å-8 Å efficient sampling of these ion pairs is no longer possible in small simulation boxes.

339

Bigger simulation boxes with minimum edge lengths of ∼16-17 Å are required to calculate reliable

340

association constants at lower temperatures.

341

5. Conclusion

342

We fit a new polarizable potential for La3+ in Cl− -bearing hydrothermal systems from first-

343

principles AIMD simulations. Production simulations were performed at 773 K and 473 K to derive

344

structural and thermodynamic properties of La3+ in dilute to concentrated solutions.

345

The new PIM interaction potential gives good estimates of La-Cl and La-O distances at the stud-

346

ied conditions. PIM provides better estimates of total coordination and Cl− coordination numbers

347

compared to N-POL MD in dilute solutions. It also reproduces the increase in La-Cl coordination

348

with increasing temperature as observed in experiments. However, the La-O distances predicted by

349

PIM are shorter than the experimental data at similar conditions.

350

Calculation of association constants reveal increasing stability of LaCl2+ and LaCl+
2 complexes

351

with increasing temperature. In general, the formation constants calculated from PIM simulations

352

are closer to the data from the AIMD and HKF models than those from N-POL MD. This is

353

despite the fact that no energy values are used in fitting the PIM. Relative stabilities of CIPs

354

and SShIPs predicted by PIM are in agreement with AIMD at both conditions. Altogether, the

355

newly fitted PIM gives more precise structural and thermodynamic insight into dilute La-Cl-bearing

356

hydrothermal fluids at both the studied temperature and pressure conditions than those from simple

357

pair potentials, with reasonable computational cost. We also show that the effects of simulation box

358

size on calculated thermodynamics properties are negligibly small at high temperatures. Our results

359

underpin the importance of an explicit description of ionic polarizability to retrieve reliable structural

360

and thermodynamic information in hydrothermal systems containing highly polarizable anions such

361

as Cl− and cations with high polarization power such as La3+ .
