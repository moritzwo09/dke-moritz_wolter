THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Abstract
The Si and Al thermodynamic data and Pitzer interaction parameters (IPs) from THEREDA were
re–evaluated in order to extend the applicability of THEREDA database for modelling
cementitious systems from low to highly saline systems. This work consisted of reassessing the
standard reference thermodynamic data for Si and Al aqueous species and some relevant anchor
solids (quartz, gibbsite, boehmite) and of producing a new consistent set of polythermal Pitzer
interaction parameters for the Si and Al aqueous species within the oceanic salt system Al–Si–
Ca–Mg–Na–K–Cl–SO4–CO3–H2O. In some cases the polythermal parameters were derived from
measured data, in others from estimates, and in some cases no data were available and no IPs
were selected (Table 4-1). To reduce the number of all possible interactions, aqueous species
interactions were selected based on the predominance of these species against the speciation of
ions in the oceanic salt system. Experimental data were collected from available published
research, if available, with measurements at different temperatures, and were used in an
optimization procedure to fit the interaction parameters and their temperature coefficients. When
no data were available, estimation methods in analogy with other species or correlations with the
SIT (Specific ion Interaction Theory) aqueous activity model parameters were used to fill the gaps
in order to avoid gross errors.
For Si in the acidic to neutral regions, polythermal interaction parameters for Si(OH)4(aq) were
determined based on a rich dataset of binary and ternary experimental data (section 2.2).
Measured data in binary and ternary electrolyte systems at different temperatures and
concentrations can be well reproduced by the derived dataset of binary interaction parameters.
The formation constant for the first silicic acid hydrolysis and its temperature dependence were
assessed together with interaction parameters in NaCl (section 2.4). For the second hydrolysis
species only limited temperature data were available requiring the use of estimation methods
(isoelectric reaction). Interaction parameters with K+ were estimated by analogy to the IPs
between K+ and HCO3– and the ones with Na+. In the presence of Ca and Mg at high pH, the
precipitation of silicate hydrates is expected. The effect of these ions was accounted for in the
present dataset by using complexes between Si and alkaline earth metals. To be consistent, no IPs
between Ca2+ and Mg 2+ cations and the Si hydrolysed species were selected in the dataset.
Additional experimental data is necessary to better constrain interactions of silica species with K+
and to evaluate the temperature dependence of the alkaline earth metals silicate complexes.
At high Si concentrations (> 0.01 m), polymeric species play a role in the aqueous speciation of
Si. Due to limited experimental data and the many different possible polymeric species it is
difficult to derive a unique dataset. Selecting only the silica tetramer (Si4O8(OH)44–) and its binary
IPs was sufficient to reproduce the measured amorphous Si solubility data at high pH in NaCl
solutions and should be sufficient for most calculations, due to the precipitation of silicate phases
and the reduction of dissolved silica.
Low and high pH data for Al in solution have been evaluated. Standard thermodynamic properties
of aluminium ions, hydrolysed species and hydroxide phases were derived using gibbsite as the
anchor phase and a large number of solubility measurements at various electrolyte concentrations
and temperatures (section 3.1). Based on existing experimental data, no temperature coefficients
were required for interactions in the Al–Cl–H2O system. This led to similar results in the
subsequent ternary and quaternary systems, where IPs at 25 °C were sufficient to describe the
measurements in the 0–100 °C temperature interval. Complexes between aluminium and sulphate
are known to form in the acidic range, but their effect was accounted for by the β(2) interaction
parameter and its temperature dependence. Data on Al–Si in the acidic region are limited. The
selected AlSiO(OH)32+ species may play a role and is valid for low concentrations (section 3.2).

At intermediate pH conditions, there are few measurements to derive IPs for the hydrolysed
aluminium species. IPs have only been derived with Cl–. No data were available to obtain IPs
between the positively charged Al hydrolysed species, SO42– and HCO3–. The IPs of Al(OH)3(aq)
were assumed to be the same as those of Si(OH)4(aq) (section 3.4.1).
At high pH conditions, the extensive gibbsite solubility data sets for a wide range of electrolyte
concentrations and temperatures (0–150 °C) allowed a consistent set of IPs to be derived for the
Na–K–Cl–OH–Al(OH)4 system (section 3.4.2). Potential IPs with Ca2+ and Mg2+ were not
selected because at these high pH values in cementitious systems Ca and Mg bearing phases will
precipitate, keeping their concentrations at low values where IPs don't play a significant role. This
can be different when interacting with CaCl2/MgCl2 solutions and needs to be tested in future
investigations. Ternary IPs with SO42– and CO32– were estimated using OH– as an analogue species
for Al(OH)4–. This approximation was based on observations from the Na–K–Cl–OH–Al(OH)4
system and gave satisfactory predictions from independent measurements of gibbsite solubilities
in Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 solutions. No significant interactions between Si and Al were expected at
high pH conditions, and their negatively charged species could well describe the measured data
in cementitious systems. In addition, the precipitation of cement phases such as C–S–H or M–S–
H will keep the Si concentration low.
Finally, the updated Pitzer model data set for aqueous speciation of Si and Al was compared with
independent data on solutions in equilibrium with cement hydrate phases (e.g. C–S–H) and
invariant points in electrolyte solutions of moderate concentrations up to 85 °C (section 3.5). The
model performed well, although additional testing against salt–rich systems is required and
further investigations that can close the gaps are recommended (chapter 4).
Fitted parameter values are marked in bold, estimates that were sensitive to measured data but
kept fixed during the fit are given in normal typeface, estimated values not backed up by data
(were estimated) are reported in italic typeface.
The updated dataset of parameters was implemented in THEREDA (https://www.thereda.de/). It
is now available for the use in calculations. The present report provides detailed documentation
on the work rationale for selecting data, model development, and optimization procedure.

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Zusammenfassung
Die thermodynamischen Daten für Silizium (Si) und Aluminium (Al) und die PitzerWechselwirkungsparameter (IPs für „interaction parameters") in THEREDA wurden neu
bewertet, um die Anwendbarkeit der THEREDA-Datenbasis für die Modellierung zementhaltiger
Systeme sowohl bei niedrigen als auch hohen Salzgehalten zu erweitern. Diese Arbeit bestand
aus einer Neubewertung der thermodynamischen Standardreferenzdaten für wässrige Si- und AlSpezies und für einige relevante Ankerfeststoffe (Quarz, Gibbsit, Böhmit) sowie der Erstellung
eines neuen konsistenten Satzes von polythermalen Pitzer-Wechselwirkungsparametern für die
wässrigen Si- und Al-Spezies innerhalb des ozeanischen Salzsystems Al-Si-Ca-Mg-Na-K-ClSO4-CO3-H2O. In einigen Fällen wurden die polythermalen Parameter aus gemessenen Daten
abgeleitet, in anderen aus Schätzungen, und in einigen Fällen waren keine Daten verfügbar und
es wurden keine IPs ausgewählt (Table 4-1). Um die Anzahl aller möglichen Wechselwirkungen
zu reduzieren, wurden nur solche Wechselwirkungen berücksichtigt bei denen die beteiligten
Spezies unter den relevanten Bedingungen im ozeanischen Salzsystem gemeinsam in
bedeutenden Konzentrationen auftreten. Experimentelle Daten wurden aus verfügbaren
veröffentlichten Forschungsarbeiten und, soweit vorhanden, aus Messungen bei verschiedenen
Temperaturen gesammelt und in einem Optimierungsverfahren zur Anpassung der
Wechselwirkungsparameter und ihrer Temperaturkoeffizienten verwendet. Wenn keine Daten
verfügbar waren, wurden Schätzmethoden in Analogie zu anderen Spezies oder Korrelationen mit
den Parametern des SIT (Specific ion Interaction Theory) wässriges Aktivitätsmodells verwendet,
um die Datenlücken zu füllen und so grobe Fehler zu vermeiden.
Für Si im sauren bis neutralen pH-Bereich wurden polythermale Wechselwirkungsparameter für
Si(OH)4(aq) auf Grundlage eines umfangreichen Datensatzes von binären und ternären
experimentellen Daten bestimmt (Abschnitt 2.2). Gemessene Daten in binären und ternären
Elektrolytsystemen bei unterschiedlichen Temperaturen und Konzentrationen konnten durch den
abgeleiteten Datensatz binärer Wechselwirkungsparameter gut reproduziert werden.
Die Bildungskonstante für die erste Kieselsäurehydrolyse und ihre Temperaturabhängigkeit
wurden zusammen mit den Wechselwirkungsparametern in NaCl bewertet (Abschnitt 2.4). Für
die zweite Hydrolyse-Spezies sind nur begrenzte Temperaturdaten verfügbar, so dass
Schätzmethoden (isoelektrische Reaktion) verwendet werden mussten. Die IPs mit K+ wurden in
Analogie zu den IPs zwischen K+ und HCO3– und denjenigen mit Na+ geschätzt. In Anwesenheit
von Ca und Mg bei hohem pH-Wert wird die Ausfällung von Silikathydraten erwartet. Die
Wirkung dieser Ionen wird im vorliegenden Datensatz durch die Verwendung von Komplexen
zwischen Si und Erdalkalimetallen berücksichtigt. Aus Gründen der Konsistenz wurden im
Datensatz keine IPs zwischen Ca2+- und Mg 2+-Kationen und den hydrolysierten Si-Spezies
ausgewählt. Zusätzliche experimentelle Daten sind erforderlich, um die Wechselwirkungen von
Siliziumdioxid-Spezies mit K+ besser einzugrenzen und auch die Temperaturabhängigkeit der
Erdalkalimetallsilikatkomplexe zu bewerten.
Bei hohen Si-Konzentrationen (> 0,01 m) spielen polymere Spezies bei der wässrigen Speziation
von Si eine bedeutende Rolle. Aufgrund der begrenzten experimentellen Daten und der vielen
verschiedenen möglichen polymeren Spezies ist es schwierig, einen eindeutigen Datensatz
abzuleiten. Die Einbeziehung von Siliziumdioxid-Tetramer (Si4O8(OH)4<4->) und seine binären
IPs ist geeignet, die gemessenen Daten zur Löslichkeit von amorphem Si bei hohem pH-Wert in
NaCl-Lösungen zu reproduzieren, und stellt aufgrund der Ausfällung von Silikatphasen und der
Reduzierung von gelöstem Siliziumdioxid auch für die meisten Berechnungen eine gute Basis
dar.
Die Daten für Al in Lösung bei niedrigem und hohem pH-Wert wurden ausgewertet.
Thermodynamische Standarddaten von Aluminiumionen, hydrolysierten Spezies und

Hydroxidphasen wurden unter Verwendung von Gibbsit als Ankerphase und einer großen Anzahl
von Löslichkeitsmessungen bei verschiedenen Elektrolytkonzentrationen und Temperaturen
abgeleitet (Abschnitt 3.1). Auf der Grundlage vorhandener experimenteller Daten wurden für die
Wechselwirkungen im System Al-Cl-H2O keine Temperaturkoeffizienten ermittelt. Auch bei der
nachfolgenden Betrachtung von ternären und quaternären Systemen reichen IPs bei 25 °C zur
Beschreibung der Messungen bei 0-100 °C aus. Es ist bekannt, dass sich im sauren pH-Bereich
Komplexe zwischen Aluminium und Sulfat bilden, ihre Wirkung wurde durch den
Wechselwirkungsparameter β(2) und seine Temperaturabhängigkeit berücksichtigt. Die Daten
über Al-Si-Wechselwirkungen im sauren pH-Bereich sind begrenzt. Die ausgewählte
AlSiO(OH)32+-Spezies könnte eine Rolle spielen und ist bei niedrigen Al-Konzentrationen präsent
(Abschnitt 3.2).
Bei neutralen pH-Werten gibt es nur wenige Messungen zur Ableitung von IPs für die
hydrolysierten Aluminiumarten. IPs wurden nur mit Cl– abgeleitet. Es liegen keine Daten vor, um
IPs zwischen den positiv geladenen Al-hydrolysierten Spezies SO42– und HCO3– anzupassen.
Aufgrund von Analogiebetrachtungen wurde angenommen, dass die IPs von Al(OH)3(aq)
dieselben sind wie die von Si(OH)4(aq) (Abschnitt 3.4.1).
Bei hohen pH-Werten ermöglichten die umfangreichen Gibbsit-Löslichkeitsdatensätze für einen
breiten Bereich von Elektrolytkonzentrationen und Temperaturen (0-150 °C) die Ableitung eines
konsistenten Satzes von IPs für das Na-K-Cl-OH-Al(OH)4-System (Abschnitt 3.4.2). Potenzielle
IPs mit Ca2+ und Mg2+ wurden nicht angepasst, da bei den relevanten hohen pH-Werten in
zementhaltigen Systemen Ca- und Mg-haltige Phasen ausfallen und deren Konzentrationen auf
Werte begrenzt, bei denen Wechselwirkungen keine bedeutende Rolle spielen. Dies kann bei der
Interaktion mit CaCl2/MgCl2-Lösungen anders sein und muss in zukünftigen Untersuchungen
getestet werden. Ternäre IPs mit SO42– und CO32– wurden unter Verwendung von OH– als analoge
Spezies für Al(OH)4– geschätzt. Diese Näherung basiert auf Beobachtungen aus dem Na-K-ClOH-Al(OH)4-System und liefert zufriedenstellende Vorhersagen aus unabhängigen Messungen
der Gibbsit-Löslichkeiten in Na2CO3- und Na2SO4-Lösungen. Bei hohen pH-Werten werden
keine signifikanten Wechselwirkungen zwischen Si und Al erwartet, und ihre negativ geladenen
Spezies können die gemessenen Daten in zementartigen Systemen gut beschreiben. Darüber
hinaus wird die Ausfällung von Zementphasen wie C-S-H oder M-S-H die Si-Konzentration
begrenzen.
Schließlich wurde der aktualisierte Datensatz des Pitzer-Modells für die wässrige Speziation von
Si und Al mit unabhängigen Daten zu Lösungen im Gleichgewicht mit Zementhydratphasen (z.
B. C-S-H) und invarianten Punkten in Elektrolytlösungen mäßiger Konzentrationen bis zu einer
Temperatur von 85 °C verglichen (Abschnitt 3.5). Diese Systeme konnten mit den ermittelten
Pitzer-Parametern gut reproduziert werden. Zusätzliche Tests in salinaren Systemen sind
erforderlich und weitere experimentelle Untersuchungen werden empfohlen, um die bestehenden
Datenlücken schließen zu können (Kapitel 4).
Angepasste Parameterwerte sind fett gedruckt, Schätzungen, die auf Messdaten beruhen und
während der Anpassung fixiert wurden, sind in normaler Schrift angegeben, geschätzte Werte,
die nicht durch Daten gestützt werden, sind kursiv gedruckt.
Der aktualisierte Datensatz von Parametern wurde in THEREDA eingegeben und steht nun für
die Verwendung in Berechnungen zur Verfügung. Der vorliegende Bericht enthält eine
detaillierte Dokumentation der Arbeitsgrundlagen für die Datenauswahl, die Modellentwicklung
und das Optimierungsverfahren.

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Introduction

To derive a thermodynamic dataset that is internally consistent and that can be applied across a
broad range of temperatures and compositions in multicomponent systems, it is essential to obtain
the standard state thermodynamic properties (e.g., log10K, fHm) and activity model parameters
(e.g., interaction parameters) of all relevant solids and aqueous species. In the case of aqueous
solutes, the standard state is defined as an ideal one molal solution at infinite dilution (I = 0 m).
For solids, the standard state is defined as the unit activity of pure solids. The data should be
obtained from well–defined experiments that are processed with consistent chemical system and
thermodynamic models. When no measured data were available, estimation methods can be used
to provide approximate values for missing data in order to avoid gross errors in calculations.
Expert evaluation, often arbitrary, is necessary to decide which estimation method to use, when
estimations are needed. These parameters need to be determined while considering their
compositional and temperature dependence.
The aqueous phase compositional dependence of the solubility of solids and aqueous species is
calculated through the functional dependence expressed by the aqueous activity model. The Pitzer
activity model is the main model supported by THEREDA database to account for the properties
of aqueous species as a function of composition. The Pitzer model (Pitzer, 1991) allows for
calculating thermodynamic properties of aqueous electrolytes in concentrated solutions with high
level of accuracy (Rowland et al., 2015). The model expresses the excess Gibbs energy as a three–
term virial expansion. The first virial term is a form of the Debye–Hückel equation, the second
term accounts for binary interactions and the third term accounts for ternary interactions. The
mathematical expressions of the Pitzer equations have been detailed elsewhere (Meyer, 2006;
Meyer and Willms, 2008; Pitzer, 1991). They contain several adjustable parameters expressed as
interaction parameters. For a binary solution up to four parameters can be used for each
cation/anion pair, and one parameter for each cation/cation, anion/anion, cation/neutral, and
anion/neutral. For a ternary system, additional parameters can be used to account for each two
cations/one anion, two anions/one cation and one cation/one anion/one neutral species ternary
interactions. Not all interactions are necessary to describe data and most dominant parameters are
the ones accounting for interactions between species of different charge while same charge
interactions being relevant only at high concentrations. The Pitzer parameters considered in this
study can be found in the list of symbols.
Additionally, the temperature effect on the activity model is accounted for through the
polythermal Pitzer interaction parameters. The temperature dependence of the Pitzer interaction
parameters is described with the following function (Pitzer–PHREEQC temperature function in
THEREDA):

1
𝑇

1
𝑇r

𝑇
𝑇r

𝑃(𝑇) = 𝐴 + 𝐵 ∙ ( − ) + 𝐶 ∙ ln ( ) + 𝐷 ∙ (𝑇 − 𝑇r ) + 𝐸 ∙ (𝑇 2 − 𝑇r2 ) + 𝐹 ∙ ( 2 − 2 )

1–1

Where P is the value of a given Pitzer interaction parameter at temperature, T (K) and A to F are
the adjustable coefficients. Notice that for this equation A is the value of the Pitzer IP at 25 °C.
Similarly, the temperature dependence of the stability of solids and aqueous complexes is
determined by analysing the functional relationship between solubility or formation reaction
constants (at standard state) and temperature. In the THEREDA, this relationship is expressed
using the NEA–transformed temperature function.

The two sets of parameters, namely the standard thermodynamic properties and the polythermal
Pitzer interaction parameters, are not independent of each other. This is because the equilibrium
constants obtained from laboratory experiments are determined in an ionic medium and need to
be extrapolated to zero ionic strength (I = 0 m) standard state using the activity model and its
parameters. In principle different activity models should lead to the same standard state properties
but due to differences in their functional dependence the results may differ. Ideally, for
consistency, the same methods used for modelling the systems of interest should be employed for
generating the database.
For low soluble solids, standard thermodynamic properties are retrieved from experiments
typically conducted in water or in binary systems with low medium concentrations, where activity
models like SIT, EDH, or Pitzer exhibit consistency within experimental uncertainty. Therefore,
the reported log10K(T) values or other properties that have been already extrapolated to I = 0 m,
using different activity models, can be directly used to assess the temperature dependence for a
given solid or aqueous species. For highly soluble salts the interdependence between the standard
thermodynamic properties and the activity model is more difficult to unwind. In such cases
measurements of solution properties (e.g., osmotic coefficient, complexation) in addition to
solubility measurements are beneficial.
In the present study, both standard state properties and Pitzer interaction parameters for Si and Al
species were reassessed. The standard thermodynamic property values were retained from
THEREDA if they already agreed with experimental data. If necessary, the properties were
updated based on a re–evaluation of existing experimental data. The new set of polythermal Pitzer
interaction parameters for Al and Si species was retrieved to ensure consistency with the oceanic
salts system in the THEREDA database. This means that all interactions between ions and
complexes from the oceanic salts system were taken as they were set in THEREDA and were
used when deriving the interaction parameters for Si and Al aqueous species. The Pitzer
interaction parameters for the oceanic salts system have been revised and extended by Voigt et
al. (2011), while maintaining consistency with the Harvie et al. parameter datasets for 25 °C
(Harvie et al., 1984). The chemical system considered is Al–Si–Ca–Mg–Na–K–Cl–SO4–CO3–
H2O.
A comprehensive Pitzer parameter dataset encompasses all potential combinations of binary and
ternary interactions among species in the chemical system. However, not all binary and ternary
combinations need to be considered since the activity coefficients depend on the interaction
parameters and the concentration of interacting species. For instance, there is no need for
interaction parameters between Al(OH)4– and H+ because the aluminate species predominates
only at high pH levels where H+ concentrations are negligible. Therefore, including an interaction
parameter involving these species would have no impact on the calculations.
In the current study, the selection of potential interaction parameters was based on the dominant
speciation of cations and anions as a function of pH (Fig.1–1) and their relevance to the Si and Al
speciation as a function of pH. Fig.1–1 illustrates that carbon speciation changes between
CO2(aq), HCO3– and CO32– from low to high pH, while sulphur is dominated by SO42– with HSO4–
playing a role only at pH < 3. The selection of possible interaction parameters is guided by species
predominance and is further discussed in the subsequent chapters.

The choice between employing binary or ternary interaction parameters depends on the specific
system under investigation and the concentrations of aqueous species that are controlled by the
solubility of solids. In cases where the system can be adequately described, binary interaction
parameters alone may suffice. Ternary mixing parameters become more significant when dealing
with multi–salt mixtures that involve high concentrations of two or more ions but have no effect
in systems dominated by one major electrolyte having other solutes in small concentrations.
To retrieve ternary interaction parameters, experiments with ternary mixtures at high
concentrations are required. However, at elevated pH conditions in multicomponent systems,
several solid phases containing Si, Al, Ca, and Mg become stable. As a result, the concentration
of these elements decreases, making it impossible to obtain sufficiently high concentrations of Al
and Si species, before the saturation of solids, necessary for retrieving the interaction parameter
values. Additionally, the high concentrations needed for these parameters to have an effect are
also not reached in calculations due to the predicted precipitation of solids (unless disequilibrium,
oversaturated metastable conditions are present).

At elevated pH, the system of interest may have a high concentration of a background electrolyte,
such as NaCl, NaOH, KCl, or KOH, while the species of interest, such as aqueous species of Al,
Si, Ca, and Mg, are bound in stable solid phases with low solubility. Consequently, their
interaction primarily occurs with the ions of the background electrolyte, making binary interaction
parameters between species of interest and ions of the background electrolyte relevant and
additional ternary interactions not necessary. Ternary interactions would therefore be necessary
for conditions of a multicomponent background electrolyte.
For situations where the species of interest are present at low to trace concentrations, in the
presence of an ionic medium, the β(0) and β(1) cation–anion interaction parameters appear to be
sufficient in describing their activity coefficients, osmotic coefficients, and reaction constant data.
Studies by Plyasunov et al. (1998) and Simoes et al. (2016) have shown that the Pitzer model can
adequately describe osmotic coefficient experimental data for single electrolytes using only β(0)
and β(1) parameters, while setting C(ϕ), β(2), and α(2) to zero. The parameter C(ϕ), becomes significant
only at high concentrations (5 mol · kg–1) (Simoes et al., 2016) and is correlated with β(1) according
to Plyasunov et al. (1998), while β(2), and α(2) are necessary to account for the highly non–ideal
behaviour of 2–2, 2–3 electrolytes at low concentrations and the effect of complexation.

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

present study, the Pitzer IPs were fitted against selected experimental data collected from
literature using the GEMSFITS parameter optimization tool (Miron et al., 2015). Each
experimental point was calculated in terms of the chemical equilibrium problem (Kulik et al.,
2013) based on the input composition and temperature conditions for the defined system
speciation, using the Pitzer model when calculating the activity coefficient. This was necessary
for modelling each experiment, since it guaranteed consistency with the available data in
THEREDA. The chemical system setup was done in GEM–Selektor v.3.9.6 (Kulik et al., 2013)
modelling package using the standard state properties and base IPs of major ions and complexes
from the THEREDA database. The code has been benchmarked against PHREEQC (interactive
3.7.3) (Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013) using the THEREDA database (v. 2020) so that the
implementation of the Pitzer model using the same database produces the same results (Fig. 1–
2).
The IPs were adjusted by the optimization algorithm to minimize the sum of squared difference
between the measured and calculated data (least squares) of several kinds that were considered
simultaneously. To avoid overfitting of the data, only the parameters that are sensitive to the
measured values were adjusted. This was done by evaluating the parameter sensitivities and
parameter correlation coefficients resulted from the fit (Miron et al., 2015).
In many cases there are not sufficient measurements that cover a wide enough range of
temperatures and compositions to retrieve all the possible standard properties of solids and IPs
with their temperature dependence within one system. To provide a dataset useful for calculations
when experimental data is lacking several estimation methods are employed.
For estimating rSm and rCp,m, necessary for calculating the temperature dependence of
solubility and complexation, the chemical reactions are rewritten in isocoulombic / isoelectric
form (Gu et al., 1994; Miron et al., 2020). For these reactions, rSm and rCp,m are small and
can be assumed to be equal to zero allowing to estimate the unknow property if the properties of
all the other reactants and products are known. This assumption leads to smaller errors when
doing calculations at elevated temperatures than in the case of just using non isocoulombic /
isoelectric reactions (Gu et al., 1994; Miron et al., 2020).
For estimating Pitzer IPs, the charge analogy (Reardon, 1990) or the relation with the SIT
parameters (Plyasunov et al., 1998) can be used. The relation with SIT is especially relevant for
NaCl electrolytes for which SIT parameters were available. When no SIT parameters were
available, these can be derived from the relation to the species charge proposed by Hummel and
Thoenen (2023).

1.1

Parameterization strategy

Depending on the available data and species predominance (Fig.1–1) the following strategy was
adopted for deriving a set of polythermal interaction parameters for Si and Al species in the
system Al–Si–Ca–Mg–Na–K–Cl–SO4–CO3–H2O from low to high pH.
From all possible binary and ternary IPs combinations between Al and Si species and ions of the
oceanic salt system only the ones for which all species are present in significant concentrations at
relevant conditions were retained for the dataset. For example, no interaction parameters with
species H+, HSO4– , CO2(aq), dominant at low pH, were retained for species dominant at high pH.
For the relevant binary and ternary interactions, initial parameter values were set based on analogy
with carbonate and sulphate species of the same charge (Reardon, 1990). Where SIT interaction
parameters with Na+ and Cl– were available in the Nagra/PSI TDB 2020 (Hummel and Thoenen
2023), these SIT parameters were used to estimate values for the β(0) and β(1) cation–anion
interaction parameters using the relation of Plyasunov et al. (1998) (Table 1-1).

The initial parameter values were refined/refitted against selected experimental data. Only the

ones were kept as estimates. Details on the estimations, selection of experimental data and fits
results are described in the following sections.
For a special case, parameters describing the interaction with K+ values could be estimated
assuming an equal difference for:

This relates to the activity of the solutes and their interactions. It was used by Wesolowski (1992)
for deriving IPs with K from Na in the system Na–K–Al–OH–Cl (see section 3.4.2).
Peer-reviewed papers and published reports were examined for collecting necessary experimental
data, mainly solid–liquid equilibria/solubilities and isopiestic measurements of osmotic
coefficients. The extensive work of Meyer and Willms (Meyer, 2006; Meyer and Willms, 2008)
was evaluated was used as a basis for building the experimental dataset. Their work contains
extensive data for binary and ternary Si and Al–containing systems at ambient and elevated
temperatures.
The fitting workflow (Fig. 1–3) involved multiple iterations, wherein different parameter
configurations were optimized to identify the ideal set of sensitive parameters capable of
reproducing the data. This process might entail the inclusion of new experimental data or
adjustments to the model, selecting relevant/sensitive parameters, parameter estimation, setting
the fitted parameters and fixed parameters, and changes to the aqueous speciation. These iterations
were repeated until an optimal solution was achieved (Fig. 1–3). The result was a set of Pitzer
interaction parameters that is consistent with the system speciation and the species of the oceanic
salt system in THEREDA.

Given the complexity of chemical systems, which involve a multitude of parameters, e.g., IPs,
species and their standard thermodynamic properties, it is possible that different equally good
datasets can be derived. This explains the existence of various Pitzer parameters datasets derived
for similar systems in the literature. Crucially, maintaining internal consistency within a dataset
is paramount. Differences could also be found for the available oceanic salt system datasets;
therefore, the newly derived dataset of Si and Al is consistent with the base data in THEREDA.
The dataset had to demonstrate also its ability to replicate accurately the data across a broad
spectrum of conditions, at the very least for those conditions used during the fitting procedure.
In the following, fitted parameter values were marked in bold typeface while estimated values
were reported in italic typeface. Values that were based on convention or that were taken from

Si

Silicon is a ubiquitous element in the environment occurring in various amorphous, crystalline,
and dissolved forms. The aqueous speciation is influenced by the dissolved silica concentration,
pH, temperature, and I. At concentrations of dissolved silica <0.01m its aqueous speciation is well
described by monomeric species such as the ortho silicic acid H4SiO4(aq), and the deprotonated
species H3SiO4–, and H2SiO32– that become more important with increasing pH.
To ensure a consistent set of standard thermodynamic data and Pitzer model IPs, the standard
thermodynamic properties for Si solids, including α-quartz (THEREDA notation:
SiO2_alpha_Qtz(cr)) and amorphous silica (SiO2(am)), were assessed. Additionally, the
thermodynamic properties of relevant aqueous species within the pH range from 2 to 14 (Fig. 2–
1) were reassessed. These species include Si(OH)4(aq), SiO(OH)3–, and SiO2(OH)22–, as well as
aqueous complexes formed between Si and alkaline metals and alkaline (earth) metals, such as
NaSiO2(OH)2–, KSiO2(OH)2–, CaSiO(OH)3+, CaSiO2(OH)2(aq), MgSiO(OH)3+, and
MgSiO2(OH)2(aq). The standard thermodynamic data mentioned above were re–evaluated and,
where necessary, revised based on available experimental data. Possible species between Al and
Si are discussed in section 3.4.3.

Standard thermodynamic data for the system Si–O–H

The standard state thermodynamic data for the Si–O–H system in THEREDA was previously
reviewed by Wilhelm (Wilhelm, 2013). Wilhelm selected the thermodynamic properties of αquartz, SiO2(am), and silica aqueous species (Si(OH)4(aq)) at the reference temperature and
pressure, along with their temperature dependence. α-Quartz from CODATA (Cox et al., 1989)
was utilized as an anchor phase to calculate the standard thermodynamic properties of other
silica solids and aqueous species. The temperature dependence of α-quartz and SiO2(am)

reference thermodynamic properties of Si(cr), α-quartz(cr) from CODATA (Table 2-1), a
consistent set of reference thermodynamic properties for SiO2(am) and Si(OH)4(aq) was derived

In the previous data evaluation by Hummel et al. (Hummel et al., 2002), the value for fCp,m of
Si(OH)4(aq) (195.204 J · K–1 · mol–1) was based on an assumption of rCp,m = 0 (2–1). However,
in the present update, the fCp,m (237.368 ± 2 J · K–1 · mol–1) was calculated to be consistent
with the Eq. 2–1 coefficients (Gunnarsson and Arnórsson, 2000), and rCp,m = 42.066 ± 2 K–1 ·
mol–1 (2–1). This revision was also done in the Nagra/PSI TDB 2020 update (Hummel and
Thoenen, 2023). Although a significant difference appears in calculations above 200 °C
(Wilhelm, 2013) when using either of the two values, the rCp,m value ensures consistency
between the thermodynamic properties and the evaluation of Gunnarsson and Arnórsson (2000).
The standard thermodynamic data for the Si acid species, SiO(OH)3–, and SiO2(OH)22– were based
on the data of (Busey and Mesmer, 1978) (see section 2.3).

2.2

Polythermal IPs for Si(OH)4(aq)

At acidic and near-neutral pH conditions (< 9), the dominant species of SiO2 in solution is the
monomer Si(OH)4(aq). This species plays a significant role in acidic brines and ordinary
groundwaters. To model the influence of electrolyte solutions on the concentration of the neutral
silicate species Si(OH)4(aq) accurately and perform calculations at different temperatures, a set
of IPs and their temperature dependence coefficients are required. Within the framework of the
Pitzer model, the relevant parameters for the interaction between neutral aqueous species and
charged species include λa(neutral, anion), λc(neutral, cation), ζ(neutral, cation, anion), ηa(neutral,
anion, anion’), and ηc(neutral, cation, cation’). Ternary IPs ζ and η can be relevant in
multicomponent systems at very high concentrations.
Various experimental datasets were available for parameterizing the model. These datasets
consisted primarily of binary systems, with some including ternary solutions, and covered a wide
range of temperatures and compositions (see Table 2-2). For deriving the model parameters, only
data up to 300 °C were considered. Beyond this temperature, the density of the water solvent

decreases as it approaches the critical point, resulting in decreased accuracy of thermodynamic
functions. Although a limited amount of data exists at higher temperatures, these temperatures
are outside the range of interest for THEREDA. During the parameterization process, no
inconsistencies within this temperature range were identified between the derived model and the
basis oceanic salts system in THEREDA, even though part of the oceanic salt system is
parameterized with data of a narrower temperature interval.

The λ(Si(OH)4(aq),cation or anion) IPs, representing the interaction of Si(OH)4(aq) with cations
and anions of the oceanic salt systems, were previously estimated by Reardon (Reardon, 1990)
based on the analogy with CO2(aq). Experimental data from Marshall and collaborators (Chen
and Marshall, 1982; Marshall, 1980; Marshall and Warakomski, 1980) on the solubility of
SiO2(am) in various electrolyte solutions at different temperatures (Table 2-2) were used by
Felmy et al. (1994), Azaroual et al. (1997), and Meyer (Meyer, 2006; Meyer and Willms, 2008)
to derive different polythermal λ IP sets that accurately describe the solubility data. Meyer
conducted additional measurements with SiO2(am) in electrolyte solutions at different
temperatures, including ternary mixed electrolyte common ion solutions (Table 2-2), and utilized
all available data to derive a comprehensive polythermal λ IP set. Gallup (1989) contributed
additional experimental data points that overlapped with the measurements by Marshall et al.
(Table 2-2). For acidic conditions, the solubility of SiO2(am) was determined by Felmy et al.
(1994) in HCl and by Elmer & Nordberg (1958) in HNO3 solutions, respectively.
Measurements conducted in common ion salt solutions, such as MgSO4–CaSO4, can provide
valuable data for deriving binary IPs between ions of the same charge, such as θc (e.g., Mg2+–
Ca2+), or ternary IPs. When considering the neutral species Si(OH)4(aq), ζ (e.g.,
Si(OH)4(aq),Mg2+, SO42–) or ηc (e.g., Si(OH)4(aq),Na+,K+) IPs can be evaluated from such
experiments. Azaroual et al. (1997) suggest that SiO2(am) solubility experiments in electrolyte
solutions with I < 7 m can be described well without introducing ternary IPs. However, Meyer
(2006; 2008) and Felmy et al. (1994) utilized ternary (ζ) IPs when deriving their parameter sets.
The need for employing ternary IPs was evaluated in this work.
It is important to note that measurements of SiO2(am) solubility can be subject to systematic errors
arising from differences in the batches of SiO2(am) used in the experiments. Factors such as grain
size, surface effects, and sample preparation methods can contribute to these variations (Marshall,
1980; Marshall and Warakomski, 1980). The measured data was scaled to the same solubility in
water using the reported measured value and the calculated reference log10K(T) values of the
SiO2(am) solubility in water (Eq. 2–2). The values from one set of measurements conducted at a

given temperature and various electrolyte concentrations were multiplied by the ratio of the
measured SiO2(am) solubility in water for that specific experimental set to the calculated
solubility in pure water (based on the standard thermodynamic properties of SiO2(am) and
Si(OH)4(aq) as selected in THEREDA). This was needed for deriving a consistent polythermal
set of λ IPs that were not affected by discrepancies in SiO2(am) batches and refer to refer to the
same standard state properties of Si(OH)4(aq) and SiO2(am). The resulted IPs were determined
only by the interactions of Si(OH)4(aq) with the electrolyte.
Previously published parameter sets were fitted to match selected experimental data, but
inconsistencies arise from the use of different conventions and parameter values, as well as
temperature coefficients, for the interactions within the hexary system of oceanic salts. In the
derived IP set by Meyer & Willms (2008), the HMW (Harvie et al., 1984) parameter values for
the basis major electrolyte interactions were employed. It is important to note that
λ(Si(OH)4(aq),cation or anion) can only be derived in pair combinations, dissolved cation and
anion, and thus, conventionally, one ion's IP in the dataset needs to be set to zero. This choice
affects only the formal ion activity coefficient, while the mean activity coefficient and equilibrium
calculations remain unaffected (Clegg et al., 2022). Different studies have made different choices
regarding which ion to set to zero. For instance, Wilhelm (2013) set the IPs with H+ to zero, while
Azaroual et al. (1997) set the IPs with Cl– to zero. THEREDA does not provide specific guidelines
for this choice, leaving it to expert judgment. In THEREDA, for example, λ(O2(aq),Cl–) and
λa(CO2(aq),H+) were set to 0, respectively. The limited measured data in HCl solutions would not
allow to derive accurate polythermal coefficients for λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–). The influence of
interactions with H+ is significant only at very low pH (< 2), while Cl– is a common ion in natural
and experimental systems across a wide range of temperature and concentrations and affects the
IPs values for all other cations of chloride salts. Therefore, λ was set to zero for the interaction of
Si(OH)4(aq) with Cl–, and the remaining parameters were derived by fitting them to the
experimental data.
After several trial fits, it was observed that all experimental data in binary solutions could be fitted
using just two temperature coefficients, A and B, ( Eq. 1–1). Coefficient A represents the value
of the IP at 25 ℃, while coefficient B describes a linear temperature dependence against the
inverse of temperature. Further attempts to incorporate additional temperature coefficients did not
result in improved fits. The coefficients from Eq. 1–1 are correlated. Precise experimental data
describing subtle changes of the IP with temperature were necessary for accurate fitting. Within
the variability of the selected data the use of A and B was sufficient.
Azaroual and Meyer (Azaroual et al., 1997; Meyer and Willms, 2008) noted that the solubility of
SiO2(am) in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions exhibits minimal differences and falls within the range
of experimental scatter. During the fitting process, it was observed that the temperature
dependence of the interactions between Si(OH)4(aq) and Na+ as well as K+ was very similar.
Additionally, the experimental data in sulphate solutions could be satisfactorily described by
setting the B temperature coefficients (Eq. 1–1) for the interaction between Si(OH)4(aq) and SO42–
to zero. With these insights, the fitting procedure incorporated the following constraints:
since λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Ca2+) = λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Mg2+), temperature coefficients
B of λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) = B of λ(Si(OH)4(aq),K+) and
B of λ(Si(OH)4(aq),SO42–) = 0
Several trial fits were conducted to determine the optimal values for these parameters
individually. However, it was found that the quality of the fit could not be significantly improved
by adjusting them independently.
The absolute values of the IPs are influenced by the choice of which IP was arbitrarily set to zero
(in this case, λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl– = 0). It is worth noting that the effect of individual ions on the

activity coefficient (γ) of Si(OH)4(aq) is additive, similar to the findings of Clegg and
Brimblecombe (1990) for O2(aq). As a result, additive relations can be employed to convert the
IPs to different conventions, such as setting λ(Si(OH)4(aq),H+) to zero, be using the following
constraints:
A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) + A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) = 0.1
B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+/K+/H+) + B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) = 40
A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),H+) + A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) = 0.146
A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),K+) + A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) = 0.04
A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Ca2+/Mg2+) + 2*A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) = 0.35
B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Ca2+/Mg2+) + 2*B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) = 144
2*A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) + A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),SO42–) = 0.1
2*B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) + B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),SO42–) = 80
A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) + A λ(Si(OH)4(aq),HCO3–) = 0.095
B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) + B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),HCO3–) = 40 (assumed the same as with Cl–)
There is no available experimental data at elevated temperatures to determine the temperature
dependence of λ(Si(OH)4(aq),HCO3–). However, based on the assumption that the B coefficient
for this interaction is similar to that of λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Cl–) (which is 0), we could estimate that B
λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Na+) + B λ(Si(OH)4(aq),HCO3–) equals 40. Additionally, there is no measured data
for evaluating λ(Si(OH)4(aq),CO32–). Nevertheless, the CO32– species becomes significant at
higher pH levels where Si(OH)4(aq) is less dominant. Consequently, the impact of this interaction
on solubility calculations should be minimal. We can assume an IP equal to that with SO42– and
with the same temperature dependence. The final A and B coefficients of Eq. 1–1 for
λ(Si(OH)4(aq),cation or anion) can be found in Table 2-3.

The experimental data in binary electrolyte solution could be fitted well using λ binary IPs (Fig.
2–2). Furthermore, the addition of ternary ζ(Si(OH)4(aq),cation,anion) IPs was tested, but it did
not result in any improvement to the fit (there was no change in the mean squared error).
Therefore, it is concluded that additional ζ ternary parameters are not necessary to accurately
describe the experimental data in binary electrolyte solutions.
The λ(Si(OH)4(aq),H+) was fitted based on measured data in HCl solutions. Marshall and
Warakomski (1980) showed that NaCl and NaNO3 solutions have indistinguishable effect on the
SiO2(am) solubilities at investigated temperatures and concentrations. This makes it possible to
complement the available data in HCl solutions with analogous measurements in nitric acid
solutions at 36, 65, and 95 ℃ (Elmer and Nordberg, 1958) and better constrain the temperature
dependence of the IP. The experimental data in HNO3 and NaNO3 can be modelled using the
equivalent concentrations of HCl and NaCl (Fig. 2–2 a, b).
The calculated solubilities in ternary systems were compared to the measured values using the
binary IPs obtained from the solubilities in binary electrolyte solutions. This comparison aimed
to determine if the model, based on the binary systems, could reproduce the ternary data within
the experimental uncertainty without the need of additional parameters such as the such as the
ηc(Si(OH)4(aq),cation,cation’) and ζ(Si(OH)4(aq),cation,anion).
The ternary systems investigated by Meyer & Willms (2006; 2008) involved the presence of a
shared anion and different cations. Comparisons between model calculated and measured values
show fairly good agreement ( Fig. 2–3). Trial fits were made with the addition of
ηc(Si(OH)4(aq),cation,cation’) and ζ(Si(OH)4(aq),cation,anion) IPs.

In the comparison between the model predictions and experimental measurements in the ternary
systems, a good agreement was achieved at 25 °C (Fig. 2–3). However, discrepancies were
observed in the Na2SO4–K2SO4 solutions, where the model consistently underpredicts the
measured solubilities by 0.1–0.18 log units (Fig. 2–4b). This discrepancy can be partially
addressed by introducing a ζ(Si(OH)4(aq),K+,SO42–) parameter of 0.25 (Fig. 2–4c). Similarly, an
ηc(Si(OH)4(aq),K+,Na+) parameter could also have a similar effect. The discrepancy between the
model and measurements in the Na2SO4–K2SO4 solutions could be attributed to systematic errors
in the measurements if we compare solubility in water to solubility in solution (Fig. 2–4a). This
increase in measured solubility occurs between 0 and 0.2 M Na2SO4, while at higher
concentrations, the values remain relatively constant within the scatter of the data. Another
possible explanation is a difference in the batch of SiO2(am) used, which could result in
systematically higher solubility. The measured SiO2(am) solubility in water was not from the
same batch as the one done in Na2SO4 solution and there is no way to know what would be the
extent of this effect. Considering the good agreement in other ternary systems and the relatively
large ternary parameter needed for only a minimal improvement, no additional ternary parameter
was selected for this system.
However, when comparing the calculations with the data reported in the tables of Meyer &
Willms (2008) at elevated temperatures (45, 65, and 85 °C), large discrepancies were observed
for the ternary systems that show god agreement for 25 °C. These discrepancies were particularly

suspicious when comparing the data at 25 °C with 45 °C (Fig. 2–5). Upon reassessing the data in
the tables, it was found that the reported concentrations of electrolytes contain an error. By
accessing the lab–archived Excel files containing the original data, it was discovered that the
concentrations reported in the "Target Concentration" column of original files significantly differ
from the values present in the tables of Meyer & Willms’s (2008) report. The electrolyte
concentrations were calculated for a mixture of stock solutions based on their mass, which were
then supposedly used in the solubility experiments. Taking the reported Target Concentration
values as the actual solution concentrations used in the experiments significantly improves the
agreement between the measured and calculated values (Fig. 2–6). Therefore, it appears that the
Target Concentration values were the correct salt concentrations, rather than the values reported
in the tables of Meyer & Willms (2008). The ternary data is well represented by the calculated
values as a function of temperature and concentration using just binary IPs (Fig. 2–6).

Hydrolysis of silicic acid

For the first and second hydrolysis of the silicic acid, the log10K(T) temperature dependence
previously available in THEREDA was based on the parameterization of Hummel et al. (Hummel
et al., 2002) which is valid up to 100 °C.
The experimental data of Busey & Mesmer (1977) in NaCl solution covers a wider range of
temperatures and can be used to derive a consistent set of log10K(T), standard thermodynamic
properties and polythermal Pitzer IPs in NaCl solutions. The coefficients for log10K(T) function
(2–3) were therefore selected from Busey & Mesmer (1977) and are valid up to 300 °C, these are
consistent with the experiments in NaCl solutions and allowed in the next step to derive a
consistent set of polythermal IPs. The reaction was reformulated in terms of THEREDA base
species (2–4)

Due to lack of data to independently derive the standard state properties and Pitzer IPs for the
second hydrolysis formation reaction (SiO2(OH)22–) in NaCl solution at 25 °C, along with their
temperature dependence, some approximations were necessary. First, the change in heat capacity,
rCp,m, for the reaction (2–5) was be estimated to be close to zero since it is isoelectric. Second,
the entropy of reaction (2–5) was adjusted to reproduce the second hydrolysis constant data in 1
M NaCl solutions measured at different temperatures (Busey & Mesmer, 1977). This adjustment
was performed while considering the selected Pitzer IPs, details in Chapter 2.4. The reaction (2–
5) was then converted into terms of the THEREDA master species (2–6) to be used in the database
and further calculations.
It is important to note that these approximations and adjustments were necessary due to the lack
of measured data, and further experimental investigations would be beneficial to accurately
determine the standard state properties and Pitzer IPs for the second hydrolysis species at different
temperatures and electrolyte concentrations (e.g. NaCl, KCl).

IPs for SiO(OH)3– and SiO2(OH)22–

The stability of silicate ions and the hydrolysis of silicic acid (Si(OH)4(aq)) have been
experimentally studied using the potentiometric method in NaCl and NaClO4 mediums (Busey
and Mesmer, 1978; Ingri, 1959; Lagerström, 1959; Santschi and Schindler, 1974; Sjöberg et al.,
1983). The experimental data is described in terms of the average number of hydroxide ions
([OH– ]) bound per Si(OH)4(aq), referred to as "Z." To avoid interference from Si polymeric
species, the concentration in the experiments was kept below 0.008 M. The data obtained at 0 ≤
Z ≤ 0.95 could be used to derive the ionization constant of SiO(OH)3– and the binary IPs (β(0), β(1),
C(ϕ)) with Na+, while data at Z ≥ 0.95 can be used to retrieve the parameters for the second
hydrolysis species, SiO2(OH)22–.
The reported hydrolysis constants for SiO(OH)3– at 25 °C (Ingri, 1959; Lagerström, 1959;
Santschi and Schindler, 1974; Sjöberg et al., 1983) and at elevated temperatures (Busey and
Mesmer, 1977) at different NaCl concentrations were used to derive a set of polythermal binary
IPs (SiO(OH)3–, Na+). During trial fits, it was observed that the data up to 3 M NaCl was well
described by using IPs values that were equal to those of (HCO3–, Na+) (Fig. 2–7a) (RMS 0.099).
The temperature dependence for these parameters was assumed to be zero. An improved fit could
be obtained by adjusting four parameters, the C(ϕ)(SiO(OH)3–,Na+) at 25 °C, A coefficient, its
temperature dependence B coefficient (Eq. 1–1), and the temperature dependence B coefficient
value of β(0)(SiO(OH)3–,Na+) and β(1)(SiO(OH)3–,Na+) (RMS 0.074, Fig. 2–7B). The remaining
IPs were assumed to be the same as those for HCO3– (Table 2-4).

Comparison between measured (full red circles) and calculated (empty blue circles)
and ionization constant data, at different temperatures, with initial IPs values from
HCO3– (a), and adjusted IPs from Table 2-4 (b).

There were no experimental data available to evaluate the IPs of SiO(OH)3– with K+, Ca2+, and
Mg2+. At alkaline conditions in the presence of Ca and Mg it is expected that silicate hydrate solid
phases will precipitate keeping Si concentration low. In addition, the effect of these ions is
accounted through the complexes between Si and Ca2+, and Mg2+ (section 2.5). In order to avoid
wrongly combining the effect of IPs and aqueous complexation at low concentrations no IPs with
Ca and Mg were selected in the dataset.
To estimate some of the missing IP values, the differences between IPs of ion pairs with the same
charge can be used due to the additivity of the electrolyte medium effect on activity coefficients.
For example, for the interaction with K+, we can assume that the difference between the IPs
coefficients in Eq. (1–1) follows the constraint:
IP (SiO(OH)3–, Na+) – IP (HCO3–, Na+) = IP (SiO(OH)3–, K+) – IP (HCO3–, K+).

2–7

The same assumption can be applied to both binary and ternary IPs. If there were experimental
data available to adjust the IPs for Na then the adjustment would be propagated to IPs with K
based on a constraint defined by 2–7. If no experimental data was available (i.e., for adjusting
interactions with Na+), the value of the chosen analogue was taken as the estimated for the missing
IP (e.g. (SiO(OH)3–, K+) = (HCO3–, K+)). The resulted parameters that were mostly based on the
analogy with HCO3–, are given in Table 2-4, and reproduce well the ionization constant data (Fig.
2–7) at different NaCl concentrations and temperatures (Busey and Mesmer, 1978).

Comparison between measured (full red circles) and calculated (empty blue circles)
osmotic coefficient (a, b, m represents the Na2SiO3 mol kg –1 H2O) and ionization
constant data (C, D), at 25 °C, with initial IPs values from CO32– (A, C), and adjusted
IPs from Table 2-5 (B, D).

Room temperature (25 °C) experimental measurements conducted at Z ≥ 0.95 in NaCl solutions
(Ingri, 1959; Lagerström, 1959; Sjöberg et al., 1983), and osmotic coefficient (OSCW)
measurements in NaSiO3 and NaSiO3+NaOH solutions (Park and Englezos, 1998) were used to
evaluate the IPs for the interactions of SiO2(OH)22– in the SiO2–NaCl–NaOH system. The initial
guesses for the IPs were based on the IPs of CO32– with the respective cations. However, when
using just the initial guesses estimates, systematic differences were observed between the
measured OSCW and the ionization constants at all concentrations and > 1 m NaCl (Fig. 2–8a,c).
To improve the agreement with the experimental data, four IPs were further adjusted: the
β(0)(SiO2(OH)22–,Na+), β(1)(SiO2(OH)22–,Na+), θa(SiO2(OH)22–,OH–) and θa(SiO2(OH)22–
,SiO(OH)3– ) Table 2-5, and standard log10K(298.15) for 2–5. The remaining IPs were fixed to
the values taken from CO32–. The discrepancy from the measured OSCW was reduced to less than
2% at concentrations > 0.25 m Na3SiO3 (Fig. 2–8b). It should be noted that the accuracy of
measured OSCW data tends to decrease at low concentrations. Different combinations of
parameters were tested, and the final set provided the best results in terms of reducing the root
mean square error (RMSE) while also having the lowest number of adjusted parameters and
maintaining analogy to CO32– for the remaining ones. The agreement between measured and
calculated data using the selected parameters is shown in Fig. 2–8b,d.

Fig. 2–9.

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Comparison between measured (circles) (Busey and Mesmer, 1977) and calculated
(lines) second hydrolysis constants at 1 m NaCl as a function of temperature.

Values for the second ionization constant at elevated temperatures are only reported in the work
of Busey & Mesmer (Busey and Mesmer, 1977) at 1 m NaCl concentration. These data are not
sufficient to evaluate the temperature dependence of the IPs due to the lack of information on the
standard entropy and heat capacity for the second hydrolysis constant. However, these data (Fig.
2–9) can be used to estimate the value of rSm for the formation reaction (written in an isoelectric
form 2–5) by assuming rCp,m = 0 and that the IPs (SiO2(OH)22–,Na+) were constant with
temperature. The rSm = –88.5 J · K–1 · mol–1 for reaction 2–5 was obtained.
It is important to note that these values should be considered as qualitative estimates since it is
not possible to separate the effect of the standard state properties from the IPs without systematic
measurements at different temperatures and electrolyte concentrations. For example, a similar
agreement could be obtained by leaving rSm and rCp,m at their initial values but setting a strong
temperature dependence on β(0)(SiO2(OH)22–,Na+) (Eq. 1–1 B ~1500). However, such a strong
temperature dependence is rather unusual, although the contribution from the change of IPs with
temperature cannot be excluded. Based on the available range of experimental data, the
independent evaluation of this contribution between different parameters was not possible.
There were no experimental data available that would allow for estimating possible IPs between
SiO2(OH)22– and Ca2+ and Mg2+. At high pH in the Ca–Mg–Si–OH system it is expected that the
aqueous solution will contain relatively low concentrations of either Ca–Mg or Si due to the rapid
precipitation of C–S–H, M–S–H, or other Ca, Mg silicate or hydroxide phases. And the effect at
low concentrations is accounted for by the formation of Si and alkali earth metals complexes,
therefore no IPs with these cations were selected.

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Metal silicate complexes

Previous studies evaluating the solubility of SiO2(am) in different electrolytes indicate that there
is no complexation with silica under neutral conditions. Therefore, all solute effects were
accounted for through IPs (chapter 2.2). Seward (Seward, 1974) proposed the formation of a Na–
silica complex at alkaline pH to explain his measured data. However, this interpretation was
challenged by Busey and Mesmer (Busey and Mesmer, 1978), who demonstrated that such a Na–
Si complex was not required to explain the solubility measurements under highly alkaline
conditions. They argued that the electrolyte effect can be adequately accounted for by considering
the interaction between Na and Si species alone.
The potentiometric data presented by Busey and Mesmer (Busey and Mesmer, 1978) for alkaline
conditions up to 5 m NaCl can be well–described without invoking complexation. In a recent
study, Miron et al. (2022) compared the measured solubility of calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H)
in NaCl solutions with calculated results. The findings revealed that when considering the
NaHSiO3(aq) species proposed by Seward (1974), an increase in Si concentration is predicted.
However, this contradicted the measured data. On the other hand, calculations performed without
considering this species showed a relatively constant to slightly decreasing Si concentration,
which aligned more closely with the experimental observations. Therefore, it is not expected that
complexes between Si and alkali metals form in cementitious systems and are not necessary to
explain the measured data.
Alkaline earth metal silicate complexes have been proposed by Santschi and Schindler (Santschi
and Schindler, 1974), who conducted potentiometric titration experiments involving H4SiO4 in
the presence of Ca and Mg ions in 1 M NaClO4 solutions at pH values up to 9 and a temperature
of 25 °C. The results of their experiments were interpreted as the formation of two weak
complexes, MSiO(OH)3+ and MSiO(OH)2(aq) (where M represents Ca2+ or Mg2+, described by
reactions 2–8 and 2–9).

Hummel and Thoenen (2023) selected reaction constants based on the data provided by Santschi
and Schindler (Santschi and Schindler, 1974). Additional experimental data on the formation of
these complexes were presented by Nicoleau and Schreiner (Nicoleau and Schreiner, 2017). Their
results indicated complexes that were approximately one order of magnitude weaker than those
chosen by Hummel and Thoenen (2021).
The neutral complex involving Ca2+ was found to have a significant influence on the calculated
concentration of Si in equilibrium with C–S–H (calcium silicate hydrate), as reported by Kulik et
al. (2022) and Walker et al. (2016), and it is necessary to accurately describe the solubility
measurements. The updated value for the formation constant (2–9) (Kulik et al., 2022; Walker et
al., 2016) is 0.5 log10 units less stable than the value selected by Hummel and Thoenen (2023),
and 1.1 log10 units more stable than the value derived by Nicoleau and Schreiner (2017). There
exists some disagreement regarding the stability of these complexes due to the challenging nature

of the experiments in this system, as noted by Nicoleau and Schreiner (2017). However, including
these complexes in the THEREDA database with the updated value for CaSiO(OH)2(aq) from
Kulik et al. (2022) is essential for accurately describing the solubility of C–S–H.
There were no available experiments that provide information on the temperature and electrolyte
concentration dependence of these species, making it impossible to extract values for rSm,
rCp,m, and Pitzer IPs for these species from measured data. As an approximation, it was assumed
that the values for rSm, rCp,m in reactions 2–10 and 2–11 were both 0, considering that these
reactions are isoelectric and the temperature effect on the reactions may be close to zero (Gu et
al., 1994; Miron et al., 2020). Binary Pitzer IPs for MSiO(OH)3+ interacting with Cl– were
estimated using the method outlined by Plyasunov et al. (Plyasunov et al., 1998) with SIT ε =
0.05 (Hummel and Thoenen, 2023) which leads to a value of 0.06 for β(0) and 0.34 for β(1). IPs for
MSiO2(OH)2(aq) with Na+, K+, Cl–, HCO3–, and SO42– were assumed to be the same as those for
Si(OH)4(aq) (Table 2-3).
The Pitzer model can potentially account for the effects of weak complexes by utilizing IPs
between Ca2+, Mg2+, and Si hydrolysed species. The β(2) parameter (with α(2) = 50) can be fitted
to capture the anomalous behaviour of 2–2 electrolytes at low concentrations used to describe the
weak complexation between SiO2(OH)22– and Ca2+. Trial calculations of C–S–H solubility in H2O
revealed that β(2) values on the order of –5000 were necessary to get similar results for the
concentration of Si in equilibrium with C–S–H at high Ca/Si ratios, comparable to using the
CaSiO2(OH)2(aq) complex instead of the IP. It is worth noting that the β(2) value (–5000) required
for the interaction between SiO2(OH)22– and Ca2+ has a similar order of magnitude as the value
(– 2700) reported for the Al2(SO4)3 electrolyte by Pitzer and Silvester (Pitzer & Silvester, 1978)
or the value (–2330) derived in section 3.3.3. In the case of Al2(SO4)3, this value is related to the
formation of Al–sulphate complexes as discussed by Reardon (Reardon, 1988). Because the
concentrations of these silicate species are low and are mainly influenced by the solubility of
solids, the choice of complexes and not IPs was preferred for the updated THEREDA dataset, as
it is also consistent with the solubility data for C–S–H and the development of thermodynamic
data for cement phases (Lothenbach et al., 2019).

2.6

Si polymeric species

At low concentrations of dissolved silica (< 0.01 m), the aqueous speciation is primarily
dominated by monomeric species. As the Si concentration increases, various Si polymeric species
such as dimeric, trimer, tetrameric, and hexameric and their deprotonated counterparts may start
to form. However, distinguishing between different types of species based on solubility and
potentiometric data is challenging. As a result, several datasets proposing overlapping or different
polymeric species have been put forward (Felmy et al., 2001; Guillaumont et al., 2003; Provis et
al., 2005; Sjöberg and Öhman, 1985). The actual speciation at high pH and high dissolved silica
concentration is still debated and cannot be unequivocally solved by solubility experiments alone
but additional experimental methods are needed. A combination of solubility, osmotic coefficient
determination (electromotive force emf, isopiestic measurements), potentiometry, and [ 29Si]
NMR can be used to analyse the species present in the system, their protonation state and extract
the thermodynamic parameters (Felmy et al., 2001; Park and Englezos, 1999a, 1998; Sjöberg et
al., 1985, 1981).
In natural environments, the concentration of dissolved silicon is typically below 0.01 m and
seldom exceeds 0.1 m. This is primarily due to the precipitation of various silicate minerals
(Sjöberg, 1996). However, the solubility of SiO2(am) sharply increases above pH 9 due to the
formation of ionized species of silicic acid and potential polymeric species. This phenomenon is
particularly relevant in highly alkaline solutions where silicate minerals are present (alkali
activated materials), resulting in high concentrations of dissolved silica and the possibility of

polysilicate species being present in the solution. The general conditions at which the polysilicate
species form are characterized by highly alkaline solutions, high silica concentrations (> 0.001
m), and high SiO2/Na2O ratios (concentrated alkali metal silicate solutions). These are relevant
for glass dissolution, zeolite synthesis, silicate and aluminosilicate binders (geopolymers) (Phair
et al., 2001; Provis et al., 2005; Sefcik and McCormick, 1997) and for looking at conditions
related to polymerisation and silicate precipitation. In the context of cementitious pore water, the
presence of C–S–H, along with other cement hydrate phases, help maintain the Si concentration
below 0.01 m, making the polymers not relevant for the bulk pore solution composition.
In the review by Hummel and Thoenen (2023), the available data on Si polymeric species were
examined. They concluded that the solubility of SiO2(am) can be adequately reproduced by
considering a single Si tetramer species, Si4O8(OH)44–. This simplified representation provides a
satisfactory description of SiO2(am) solubility.

When comparing the measured and calculated solubility of SiO2(am) using only the monomeric
species (Fig. 2–10a), it becomes evident that the data at 1 and 3 m NaCl were underestimated
above 0.01 m Si. To address this discrepancy, a similar approach as suggested by Hummel and
Thoenen (2023) was adopted in this study. The approach considers the contribution of a single Si
tetramer species, Si4O8(OH)44–, and adjusting two parameters, its stability constant and the β(0)
binary IP, to fit the data from Zarubin and Nemkina (1990). The resulted log10K(298.15) value is
=–36.695, similar the one selected by (Grenthe et al., 1992) of –36.3 ±0.5, and by (Hummel and
Thoenen, 2023) of –36.28 ±0.16. The resulted β(0) is 1.35, a value close to 1.1 selected by (Felmy
et al., 2001).
This choice of using a Si tetramer species satisfactorily reproduces the data (Fig. 2–10b) because
the slope of the measured data was approximately 4.3 and 3.7 at 1 and 3 m NaCl, respectively.
These values suggest that a polymeric species with a charge around –4, could account for the
observed data. However, it should be noted that NMR studies (Felmy et al., 2001; Provis et al.,
2005) have demonstrated the formation of several different polymeric species under varying Si
concentrations, pH levels, and electrolyte concentrations. While the present simplification of

considering a single tetramer species was sufficient for describing measured Si solubility data,
further investigations are needed to establish a consistent set of polymeric species and determine
their temperature and electrolyte concentration dependence.

There were no available investigations that describe the stability of Si4O8(OH)44– at different
temperatures. The study from Busey and Mesmer (1978) provides log10K(T) values for a
different tetramer, Si4O6(OH)62–, in 1 M NaCl solutions at various temperatures. To minimize
errors at elevated temperatures, it was reasonable to assume a rSm and rCp,m of 0 for the
isoelectric reaction (2–12). The formation reaction with temperature dependence was then
rewritten in terms of THEREDA master species (2–13).
No measurements were available in order to derive IPs with K+. To avoid gross errors the values
of the binary IPs with K+ were taken as analogue to Na+ ones.

Standard thermodynamic data for the system Al–O–H

Thermodynamic properties of gibbsite (Al(OH)3(cr)) were used as anchor to derive a consistent
set of standard thermodynamic properties (at I = 0) in the system Al–O–H (Table 3-1). Properties
of Al(cr) were taken from CODATA (Cox et al., 1989). Values for fH298, fS298, and fCp,298
of gibbsite were taken from (Robie and Hemingway, 1995) and were based on thermochemical
measurements of (Hemingway et al., 1977; Hemingway and Robie, 1977). In addition the
measured fCp,298 of boehmite was taken as anchor value for the heat capacity.

Brown and Ekberg, 2016 (Brown and Ekberg, 2016) reviewed the available data on the solubility
of aluminium hydroxides and the formation of aluminium hydrolysed species. These data were
used to derive a consistent reference thermodynamic dataset for Al–O–H.
When plotted against the inverse of the absolute temperature, the values of the gibbsite and
boehmite solubility reaction constants show a linear trend (Fig. 3–1a). The temperature
dependence of such reactions can be estimated using 2–term extrapolation method where heat
capacities of the reaction can be assumed to be zero. The temperature dependence coefficients
(1–1) of the reactions (3–1, 3–2) were derived by fitting the reaction constant data by (Brown and
Ekberg, 2016):

calculated (3–1, 3–3) and measured data for boehmite selected in this study from
(Bénézeth et al., 2001; Palmer et al., 2001) and from (Verdes et al., 1992).

Accepting these data for the two Al solids results that gibbsite is predicted to be stable only at
temperatures bellow 19 °C. This is in contradiction with statements that boehmite becomes the
stable phase only at around > 80–100 °C (Brown and Ekberg, 2016; Ruff et al., 2008;
Wesolowski, 1992; Zhang et al., 2021, 2019). Experiments on boehmite solubility bellow 100 °C
may be problematic and could be affected by dissolution and reprecipitation of aluminium
hydroxide. Data for the solubility of boehmite bellow 100 °C selected by (Brown and Ekberg,
2016) from (Bénézeth et al., 2001; Palmer et al., 2001) were based on model extrapolation and
were not individual measurements. By selecting only the data reported by (Bénézeth et al., 2001;
Palmer et al., 2001) at experimental conditions and adding the two measurements at 90 and 70 °C
from (Verdes et al., 1992) that were not selected by (Brown and Ekberg, 2016) new coefficients
for boehmite solubility were determined (Fig. 3–1b).

A small heat capacity of reaction (–37.88 J · K–1 · mol–1) was needed to maintain the consistency
with the measured fCp,298 of boehmite (Table 3-1). There is a large discrepancy with the low
temperature data for boehmite but the trend of boehmite being less stable than gibbsite is apparent
(Fig. 3–1b). The new dataset maintains a good agreement with the high temperature data for
boehmite and results in a transition temperature between gibbsite and boehmite of 82 °C. More
additional investigations are need to better determine the transition temperature between gibbsite
and boehmite. Using the revised reaction properties, standard thermodynamic data for H2O(l),
Al(cr), H2(g) and O2(g), a consistent set of standard properties fH298, fS298, and fCp,298 of

across the range 0 – 300 °C, with the exception of Al(OH)4– that has a curvilinear trend in the
same temperature range (Brown and Ekberg, 2016). A linear trend exists if we limit the data to
the 0 – 200 °C range, which is within the applicability range of THEREDA. The coefficients
derived by (Brown and Ekberg, 2016) were accepted in the present study while for Al(OH)4– new

Al polymeric species and interactions with Si at low pH

Several Al polymeric species have been described in the literature, e.g., Al2(OH)24+, Al3(OH)45+
and Al13(OH)327+ (Brown and Ekberg, 2016). These species form at very high aluminium
concentrations and in acidic conditions. Including them in the database would require to introduce
respective binary and possibly ternary IPs with all major anions. Based on the experimental
measurements evaluated bellow such species were not found necessary to describe the data and
therefore were not selected for THEREDA.
The AlSiO(OH)32+ complex has been described in studies of the acidic region pH range 3.5 < pH
< 5.5 at milli molar Al and Si concentrations. (Hummel and Thoenen, 2023) retrieved standard
thermodynamic properties for the formation of these species from studies at 25 °C and at different
temperatures up to 150 °C (Pokrovski et al., 1996). These standard thermodynamic data
(Pokrovski et al., 1996) were selected in THEREDA. Pitzer IPs for this species with Cl–, β(0) 0.225
and β(0) 1.56, were estimated based on correlation with SIT (Table 1-1), ε 0.15 (Hummel and
Thoenen, 2023). No data were available to retrieve or estimated IPs with HCO3– and SO42– anions.
Care should be taken if this complex is predicted above milli molar concentrations in calculations
of concentrated electrolyte solutions. Solubility data on aluminosilicates minerals in different
electrolyte solutions at various temperatures are needed to better constrain this complex and
derive a consistent set of polythermal Pitzer IPs.

A different procedure for Al–Si at low pH, would have been to disregard the Al–Si complex
formation and derive IP between Si(OH)4(aq) and Al3+. The concentration of these species in the
available experiments is too low to be able to derive Pitzer IPs. (Accornero and Marini, 2009)
proposed a correlation between λ IPs of Si(OH)4(aq) and different ions and derived an
λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Al2+) of 0.4. A similar correlation using the data derived in the present study leads
to λ(Si(OH)4(aq),Al2+) of 0.8. No measured data were available at high enough concentrations to
test these values and only using AlSiO(OH)32+ allows the reproduction of measured data at low
concentrations of Si–Al in the acidic region of (Pokrovski et al., 1996).

IPs in the Al–Ca–Mg–Cl–OH–SO4–CO2 system at low pH

At low pH conditions where Al3+ is the dominant species the binary and ternary IPs between Al3+
anions and cations, of the system Al–Ca–Mg–Cl–OH–SO4, were evaluated based on available
experimental data. Limited experimental data in the presence of carbonate were used to evaluate
possible interactions with CO2(aq) species that is dominant at low pH.

3.3.1

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Al–Cl–H2O

The Pitzer IPs in this system were retrieved based on the available solubility of AlCl3·6H2O and
osmotic coefficient data at different temperatures and concentrations. Several parameter sets were
previously reported in the literature and were derived using different datasets. The parameter set
of Pitzer & Mayorga (1973), for 25 °C, was derived from fitting the osmotic coefficient data
reported in (Robinson and Stokes, 1965). Christov et al. (2007) in their study evaluated the data
on aluminum in the acidic system and produced an updated set of parameters that contains also
polythermal coefficients. Both parameter sets reproduce the osmotic coefficient data but diverged
when were used to calculate the solubility of AlCl3·6H2O(cr) (Chloraluminite) (Fig. 3–3). The
parameterization of Christov et al. (2007) agrees with the dataset of (Wang et al., 2016) that shows
a steeper slope. It was not clear as to why there is this difference between the experiments, but it
may be related to the starting material (AlCl3·6H2O(cr)) and experimental setup. In addition, the
standard thermodynamic properties of the AlCl3·6H2O(cr) were not derived independently from
the IPs and the temperature effect may be fitted either in the standard properties of the solid phase
or in the IP temperature coefficients. Therefore, different sets of IPs, with their temperature
coefficients, as well as standard thermodynamic properties of AlCl3·6H2O(cr) and their
temperature dependence can be derived to describe the experimental data.
In the present evaluation a good agreement with the experimental data was obtained up to 100 °C
without the need for introducing temperature dependence coefficients for the IPs (Table 3-2). This
was done by taking the parameters of Pitzer & Mayorga (1973) as such and accepting the
agreement with the lower slope in the solubility of the AlCl3·6H2O(cr) as a function of
temperature (Fig. 3–3b). The only necessary adjustment that improved the agreement with the
osmotic coefficient data above 2 m AlCl3 was to set the C ϕ)(Al3+,Cl–) to zero (compared to
0.00273 reported in Pitzer & Mayorga (1973)).
The values of the selected IPs for the Al–Cl–H2O were important because they propagate to the
derived values for interactions in ternary systems containing other electrolytes. In the subsequent
evaluations of ternary systems, it was found that not using temperature coefficients for the
interactions in Al–Cl–H2O has the positive consequence of fewer or no temperature coefficients
to be needed to describe the ternary electrolyte systems at different temperatures. This greatly
reduces the number of parameters while keeping good agreement with the measured data.

100 temperature range. A good agreement could be obtained with the measured data in the Al–
NaCl system (Fig. 3–4). Test calculations were done to set the θc(Al3+,Na+) to a value close to 0,
similar to the IP values for the other ions of metals, but this leads to a worse agreement with the
gibbsite solubility at increased NaCl concentrations.

The calculated data for the solubility of KCl(cr) shows worse agreement with measured values
for some datasets at lower temperatures (Fig. 3–4c). The agreement could not be improved when
considering all datasets and adjusting the IPs. No temperature dependence coefficients (1–1) were
necessary for the IPs with K+.
In the Al–Ca–Cl–H2O system the value for the derived binary IP with Ca2+ is 0 with a ternary IP
ψc(Al3+,Cl–,Ca2+) having a value similar to the one for Na+ and K+. Calculated values using the
derived parameters for the solubility of NaCl(cr) in CaCl2+AlCl3 solution (not shown) and of
AlCl3·6H2O at different temperatures were in agreement with the measured data (Fig. 3–4f).
When evaluating the data in chloride and sulphate aluminium containing systems, different
authors (André et al., 2018; Christov, 2001; Reardon, 1988) derived values for the binary
aluminium metal (M) interaction θc(Al3+,M) that were zero or close to 0, and values for the ternary
IPs ψc(Al3+,Cl–/SO42–,M) that were between –0.1 to 0.1. This is in accordance with the values
derived in the present study for the ternary parameters (ψc). The binary parameters derived here

Al–SO4–H2O and Al–Na–K–Mg–SO4–H2O systems

Osmotic coefficient in Al2(SO4)3 solutions at 25 °C was used in various research works to derive
different Pitzer parameter sets for the aluminium metal sulphate system (Christov, 2001; Pitzer
and Silvester, 1978; Reardon, 1988). The challenges in this system primarily arise from the strong
tendency for complexation between aluminium and sulphate ions (e.g., AlSO4+ and Al(SO4)2–).
The Pitzer model is most suitable for systems with fully dissociated electrolytes. Describing the
chemical systems using complexes between Al and sulphate requires the inclusion of additional
interactions for these species with other solutes, significantly increasing the number of
parameters, which can lead to difficulties when parameterizing such systems. In this study, we
address this issue by adjusting the IPs values without explicitly including any aluminum sulphate
complexes in the dataset. However, in other activity models, like Davies or Debye–Huckel, these
species were needed when modelling such systems because such models cannot account for such
effects through IPs.

Different available Pitzer datasets (Christov, 2001; Pitzer and Silvester, 1978; Reardon, 1988),
were derived without using Al sulphate speciation. These datasets significantly differ in their
approach to setting the alpha parameters and determining the value of the β(2) IP. The alpha
parameters (α(1) and α(2)) were used to account for the I dependence of binary interactions of β(1)
and β(2) IPs. Based on empirical fits to experimental data, the values for α(1) and α(2) were in most
cases set to 1.4 and 12 for 2:2 electrolytes and 2.0 and 50 for 3:2 and 2:3 electrolytes, respectively.
However, relying solely on these values may hinder the ability to achieve improved fits to
experimental data of different types, as perfect fits to osmotic coefficient data might not
correspond to accurate predictions of mineral solubility.
Reardon (1988) encountered difficulties obtaining good agreement with the osmotic coefficient
data in Al2(SO4)3 solutions of intermediate concentrations, although achieving good agreement
with solubilities in mixed metal sulphate systems, while at the same time keeping the α(1) and α(2)
values for 2:3 electrolytes. In contrast, Christov (2001) proposed to adjust the values of α(1) and
α(2) parameters to resolve the discrepancy between osmotic coefficient and solubility data,
ultimately settling on a value of 1 for the α(2) and 2 for α(1) parameter. Another challenge in this
system is determining the β(2) parameter. (Pitzer and Silvester, 1978) suggest to constrain the
value based on reported stability constants of the AlSO4+ species, while others rely on fitting this
parameters against experimental data (Christov, 2001; Reardon, 1988).

In the present study, the aim was to achieve the best agreement with measured data for both
osmotic coefficient and gypsum solubility in Al2(SO4)3 and AlCl3 solutions. To do so, the IPs in
the binary Al–SO4 and ternary Al–M–SO4 systems were simultaneously fitted, including the β(2)
parameter and its temperature coefficients, while exploring different combinations of α(1) and α(2)
parameters. The β(2) and its temperature dependence implicitly accounts for the effect of Al
sulphate speciation. After careful analysis, we found that the best agreement with experimental
data was obtained by setting the α(1) parameter to 1.4 and leaving the α(2) parameter at 50 (Table
3-6). This approach allows us to better better model the osmotic coefficient data (Fig. 3–6) and
the solubility of gypsum in Al2(SO4)3 and AlCl3 solutions (Fig. 3–7). The temperature dependence
of the dataset was evaluated based on limited data on gypsum solubility in AlCl3 solutions (Li
and Demopoulos, 2006) and with the exception of β(2) the temperature coefficients of the other
IPs were estimated to be 0 for the 25–80 °C interval. Additional experimental data would be

The binary IPs of Al3+ with the metal cations were consistent in both chlorine and sulphate
systems. For assessing the ternary IPs ψc(Al3+,SO42–,metal), solubility data for mirabilite
(Na2(SO4) 10H2O), epsomite (Mg(SO4) 7H2O) and arcanite (K2(SO4)) measured at 25 °C were
used (Table 3-5). With the exception of the ternary IP with Na+, having 0 values for all the other
parameters (Table 3-6) lead to good agreement with the measured data (Fig. 3–8). The discrepant
value for Na+ is related to the value for the binary θc(Al3+,Na+), constrained by the gibbsite
solubility, that is also different when compared with the other metals. This shows the relation
between different Pitzer parameters in binary and ternary systems and the reason why non unique
parameter sets can be derived to achieve similar agreement with the experimental data.

IPs in the Al–Ca–Mg–Cl–OH–SO4–CO2 system at intermediate to high
pH

From low to high pH Al3+ hydrolyses to form a series of species of the form Al(OH)n3–n where n
ranges from 0 to 4. Available data to derive standard thermodynamic properties (section 3.1) and
IPs were solubility and osmotic coefficient measurements (Table 3-7). Most data were available
at high pH, where the Al(OH)4– species dominates. Potentiometric data were available for the first
aluminium hydrolysis (AlOH2+) at various temperatures in NaCl solutions (Palmer and
Wesolowski, 1993). Only for these two species could IPs be obtained from experimental data in
NaCl systems. For the intermediate hydrolysed species Al(OH)2+ IPs with Cl– were estimated
from SIT correlations (Table 1-1) from ε 0.05 (Hummel and Thoenen, 2023). For Al(OH)3(aq)
IPs were assumed to be the same by analogy with Si(OH)4(aq). No data or estimation methods
were available to be able to derive IPs for AlOH2+, Al(OH)2+ with HCO3– and SO42–.

At intermediate pH Al hydrolysed species play a role in the dissolved concentration of aluminium.
Data for the first hydrolysed species have been collected in NaCl solutions from 25 to 100 °C
(Palmer and Wesolowski, 1993). The initial values for the IPs were estimated based on the
correlation with SIT (Table 1-1) ε 0.15 (Hummel and Thoenen, 2023) and further adjusted to the
measured data (Fig. 3–10). IPs for the second hydrolysis constant were estimated using ε 0.05

Si(OH)4(aq).

This should be a reasonable approximation for the salting out effect of the background electrolyte
(e.g., NaCl) has on the neutral species. Other IPs that may be required for the positively charged
hydrolysis species with SO42– and HCO3– cannot be determined due to the lack of experimental
data where these species were present at significant concentrations. Additional experimental data
are required for the solubility of aluminium hydroxides in sulphate and carbonate solutions at

System Na–K–Cl–OH–Al(OH)4

Extensive data sets on the solubility of aluminium hydroxides (gibbsite and boehmite) have been
published. Measurements have been made up to high concentrations of Na/K–OH–Cl solutions
and over wide range of temperatures (Table 3-7) allowing a polythermal set of Pitzer IPs to be
derived. (Wesolowski, 1992) derives a Pitzer model in the system Na–K–Cl–OH–Al(OH)4 using
his own data and published data (Russell et al., 1955), and finds that the system can be described
by a number of approximations:
β(0)(Na+,OH–) – β(0) (Na+,Al(OH)4–) = β(0)(K+,OH–) – β(0)(K+,Al(OH)4–) = 0.0356

Such approximations have been used in the present work to derive missing IPs with K+ from those

were obtained. The differences between the polythermal Pitzer IP coefficients were 0.0. An

optimizing θa (Al(OH)4–,Cl–) –0.045, θa(Al(OH)4–,OH–) 0.0, compared to 0.014 in (Wesolowski,
1992), and ψa(Al(OH)4–,Na+/K+,OH–) –0.003, compared to –0.0048 in (Wesolowski, 1992). The
agreement between measured and modelled data is within the experimental uncertainty for
gibbsite solubility in NaOH, KOH, NaOH–NaCl, and NaCl–KCl–KOH solutions of different
concentrations up to 100 °C (Fig. 3–11). Discrepancies can be observed in KOH solutions above
5 M KOH with data from (Luo et al., 2020). In this case the agreement can be further improved
by setting a value of –0.007 for C(ϕ)(Al(OH)4–,K+). In addition, there is excellent agreement with
the osmotic coefficient measurements in NaOH–NaAl(OH)4 solutions made at 40 and 125 °C.
Systematic over–predictions of the osmotic coefficient measurements in NaOH–AlCl3 solutions
of (Park and Englezos, 1999b) were observed but can’t be explained. The same discrepancy was
mentioned by (Königsberger et al., 2006) that this data set can't be reproduced by the Pitzer model
and seems to be inconsistent with other measurements.

System Ca–Mg–CO3–SO4–Al(OH)4

No measured data were available to derive potential IPs between Al(OH)4–, Ca2+, and Mg2+. At
elevated pH conditions it is expected that calcium and magnesium hydroxides will precipitate
(e.g. portlandite, brucite) and other calcium and magnesium cementitious phases are expected to
precipitate, keeping these elements at millimolar concentrations, making the effect of IPs
insignificant compared to other possible background electrolytes such as the alkali metals.
Interactions between Al(OH)4– and other negatively charged species such as CO32– and SO42– may
become relevant in concentrated solutions. Using the observations from the NaOH–Al(OH)4
system these IPs and their temperature coefficients were estimated to be equal to those with OH–
as analogous for Al(OH)4– (Table 3-10). An independent test of the derived model predictions
against measurements of gibbsite solubility in solutions containing varying amounts of Na2CO3
and in synthetic Bayer liquors (containing Cl–CO3–SO4) shows good agreement with the derived
Pitzer IPs set (Fig. 3–12). The solution concentration reported in (Bouzat and Philipponneau,
1991) was approximated to molality using the density of NaOH solutions at 60 and 50 °C.
Therefore the measured data may not represent the true values although a large difference having
the correct solutions densities is not expected. (Königsberger et al., 2006) got good agreement
with these measurements and predictions using a very similar Pitzer model.

Al – Si and polymeric species

At elevated pH conditions aluminium hydroxides are expected to precipitate and in cementitious
systems aluminate phases are expected to form. (Pokrovskii and Helgeson, 1995) suggest that
oligomeric anions such as Al2O(OH)62–, Al(OH)63–, only occur at aluminate concentrations above
1.5 mol/kg and at very high sodium hydroxide concentrations (> 5 mol/L) (Hummel and Thoenen,
2023). The evaluated experimental data even at very high concentrations of Al and hydroxide
solutions show that the aluminium monomeric species Al(OH)4– with the corresponding Pitzer
IPs were sufficient to model the observations. This was confirmed in the comprehensive model
for Bayer Liquors by (Königsberger et al., 2006), these solutions are important in the refinement
of alumina from bauxite ore. When modelling the solubility of calcium silicate hydrates, which
control the pore solution composition in most cementitious systems, measured data could be
described by monomeric species alone (Miron et al., 2021) (Al concentration is bellow millimolar
values).

Other species reported in the literature are complexes with the alkali ions Na+ and K+,
NaAl(OH)4(aq) and KAl(OH)4(aq), respectively, which were used to describe the solubility of
gibbsite and boehmite in alkaline hydroxide solutions (Miron et al., 2016; Pokrovskii and
Helgeson, 1997, 1995). These species were used in conjunction with Debye–Hückel–type activity
models, and were not required in interaction–based activity models such as SIT or Pitzer.
Including them would create an inconsistency with the IPs of Al(OH)4– and the alkali ions.
Several studies have suggested possible Al–Si complexation at elevated pH conditions (Gout et
al., 1999, 2000; Salvi et al., 1998; Xiong, 2013, 2016). Neither Al(OH)3SiO(OH)3– nor
AlSiO3(OH)43– complexes were found to be important for explaining the measured potentiometric
and NMR measurements (Gout et al., 2000, 1999) at pH ~12.5 and the Al(OH)3SiO(OH)3–
complex was later retracted (Hummel and Thoenen, 2023). (Gout et al., 2000) suggest the
existence of different polynuclear Al – Si complexes at m(Al,Si) > 0.006 m, but there were no
data to distinguish them or to determine the properties of these complexes. (Salvi et al., 1998)
suggest that Si–Al complexation may be relevant in strongly acidic solutions (pH < 2,
AlSiO(OH)32+ as selected in section 3.2), and above pH 4.5 forming Al(OH)3SiO(OH)3–. At pH
14 (Gout et al., 2000) the importance of AlSiO3(OH)43– was suggested. If such complexes were
formed in significant amounts under alkaline conditions, they would be relevant to the modelling
of cementitious systems and other alkali–rich systems, e.g. zeolites. (Xiong, 2013) developed a
Pitzer model for Si and Al in alkaline conditions and found that the use of Al–Si complexes was
not necessary to model the solubility experiments in concentrated NaOH solutions up to 90 °C.
The important species at experimental conditions were predicted to be the monomeric Si and
Al(OH)4–. When the CASH+ model (Miron et al., 2021) was developed using the cemdata18
database, which includes the AlSiO3(OH)43– species, Al(OH)4– was the only contributor to the
dissolved Al and was sufficient to describe the measured solubility data. Due to the limited
information on the importance of Al–Si complexation at 0–100 °C in cementitious systems and
the lack of measured data over wide range of conditions to be able to derive Pitzer IPs for these
species, they were not selected for inclusion in the THEREDA database.

Benchmark against experimental data on the solubility of cement
hydrates

The newly derived model was compared with independent published solubility data of relevant
hydrated cement phases, C–S–H, M–S–H, and various cement phase assemblages at invariant
points. The thermodynamic data for the solid phases were taken as such from THEREDA (v2022)
and originated from cemdata18 (Lothenbach et al., 2019). For comparisons with solubility
measurements for aluminium containing C–S–H, the new CASH+ model and parameterization
was used (Kulik et al., 2022; Miron et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2021). It is important to note that the
standard thermodynamic properties of these solids were derived from solution data using a
different activity model (Lothenbach et al., 2019). In general, the concentrations of these solutions
were below 0.5 molal, where the predictions of different activity models converge. Therefore,
good agreement with the updated Pitzer dataset is important, but some differences were
acceptable and can only be reconciled if the standard thermodynamic data for these cement
hydrate phases were retrieved from their solubility measurements modelled using the updated
Pitzer dataset and the THEREDA database. Such an endeavour was beyond the scope of the
present work.

Predictions of solution compositions using the updated Pitzer model were compared with
measured C–S–H solubility in different electrolyte solutions and different temperatures (Fig. 3–

dominated by SiO(OH)3– and Si(OH)4(aq) species at low, SiO(OH)3– at intermediate and
CaSiO2(OH)2(aq) at high Ca/Si ratios, respectively. The proportions of species change in alkaline
solutions where SiO2(OH)22– becomes dominant and Ca is controlled by CaSiO2(OH)2(aq) instead
of Ca2+ at low Ca/Si ratios. In general, Ca concentrations in solution were predicted to be around
a few millimoles and decreases in alkali hydroxide solutions. Si concentrations were bellow
millimolar at high Ca/Si but they increase in alkali hydroxide solutions at low Ca/Si ratios. Al
concentrations decrease with increasing Ca/Si in alkali hydroxide solutions and were exclusively
determined by the Al(OH)4– species. Some discrepancies with measured Ca concentrations at low

The updated model predictions agree well with measured CAH (calcium aluminate hydrate,

well reproduced by the model (Fig. 3–16).
For a better overview of the model predictions for different relevant cement phases calculations
were done for several invariant points and compared with measured values based on data collected
by (Prentice, 2018) (Table 3-12, Table 3-12). Good agreement was obtained between the
measured and calculated data with few disagreements (Table 3-12) unlikely to be due to the
present aqueous model.

Status of data, implications and data gaps

The thermodynamic data in the Al–Si–Ca–Mg–Na–K–Cl–SO2–CO2–H2O system have been
reviewed, in particular the interactions between aqueous Si and Al species and the oceanic salt
ions. The standard thermodynamic properties of Si and Al aqueous species, oxide and hydroxide
solids have also been re-evaluated. A summary of the status of the available data and parameters
is given in Table 4-1. Based on the available experimental measurements, a polythermal set of
IPs was retrieved. In cases where experimental data were not available, to avoid gross errors in
calculations, interactions have been estimated based on analogy or correlation with the SIT
parameters. Such approximations should provide a qualitative representation of systems with a
major binary background electrolyte up to moderate concentrations. The data set updated in
THEREDA is consistent with the cemdat18 extension and is valid up to moderate temperatures
of 100-150 °C. The available experimental data do not cover the investigated system
homogeneously for different compositions and temperatures. There were several shortcomings in
the data and additional investigations and experimental measurements are required to evaluate the
thermodynamic data of the species and the IPs.
For the Si system, there were limited measured data at high pH conditions relevant to cement
systems, especially for the SiO2(OH)22–. Further investigations are recommended:
•

Solubility data for quartz and SiO2(am) at high pH and elevated T to constrain the
temperature dependence and in KOH-KCl solutions to retrieve the corresponding IPs,
currently estimated. Potentiometric measurements of silicic acid hydrolysis in KCl-KOH
solutions 0-100 °C. Complementary data to test potential ternary interactions with
sulphate and carbonate solutions at high pH. Measurements in ACl3 solutions for the Si
and Al interactions/complexation at low pH.

•

Measurements in solutions of CaCl2, MgCl2 relevant to high salinity systems to evaluate
data Si complexation with alkaline earth metals and investigate if interactions with Si
species are needed. These may include solubility measurements of CaSiO3/MgSiO3 and
thaumasite in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions.

•

Solubility, potentiometric and NMR studies of polymeric Si species that may play a role
in Si rich solutions of late stages of degradation of cementitious materials - zeolites and
zeolite precursors or highly altered cement interacting with MgCl2 solutions.. To evaluate
their stability constants, IPs and temperature dependencies.

For the Al, there were no data on possible interactions and complex formation with Ca and Mg
ions due to their low concentrations in classical cementitious systems. Concentrations may be
high for alkali activated systems and for interactions with CaCl2/MgCl2 salt solutions. Further
investigations are recommended:
•

Gibbsite solubility measurements in MgCl2 and CaCl2 rich solutions, 0-100 °C, in
association with portlandite and brucite.

•

Effect of Si on the gibbsite solubility at high pH to understand if Al-Si interactions may
be relevant, especially in high concentration solutions at late stages of degradation.

Although outside the scope of this study, solid phases and their properties determine the
composition of the pore solution with which they are in equilibrium. Therefore, a good knowledge
of these phases is necessary, especially of the various secondary phases and alteration products
that may form during cement interactions with salt solutions. The stable phases are influenced by
the relative proportions of Si, Al, sulphate and carbonate to the saline electrolyte.
•

Measurements of the stability of Kuzel's and Friedel's salts to constrain their stability as
a function of temperature.

THEREDA Si–Al Pitzer dataset

Solubility of cement phases in NaCl, NaOH, KCl, KOH (AFm monosulphate,
hemicarbonate, Kuzel's and Friedel's salts) and the effect of temperature.

Particularly in the late stages of cement degradation and in alkali activated systems, zeolites and
zeolite precursor phases are expected to play a role. Recent studies on these phases (Ma and
Lothenbach, 2021, 2020a, 2020b) can be used to provide necessary thermodynamic data for these
phases in THEREDA.
The newly derived set of thermodynamic properties and Pitzer IPs can be compared and further
improved with new experimental solubility measurements up to the saturation of salts e.g., NaCl,
KCl, Na2SO4, K2SO4, CaCl2, MgCl2 in systems containing C-S-H, M-S-H as well as other cement
relevant phase assemblages.
