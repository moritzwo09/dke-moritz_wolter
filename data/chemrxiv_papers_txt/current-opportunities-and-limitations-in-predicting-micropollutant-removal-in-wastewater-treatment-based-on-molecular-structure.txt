Introduction

10

Continuous release of harmful substances from WWTPs remains a global issue, emphasizing the urgent

11

need for strategies to mitigate their impact on human health and the environment. Besides advanced

12

treatment, these strategies involve alternatives assessment and safe-by-design initiatives.1‚Äì3 Both

13

strategies would highly benefit from models to predict removals of individual chemicals in WWTPs,

14

but sufficiently accurate models to do so are missing.

15

Examples of state-of-the-art tools for predicting removals in WWTPs are the STP model in EPI Suite

16

(i.e., STPWIN4) and SimpleTreat5, both widely used in risk assessment and regulatory settings.6 These

17

models have a strong mechanistic foundation and effectively describe the various processes that

18

influence the fate of chemicals within treatment plants.7‚Äì10 However, their performance relies heavily

19

on the accuracy with which the properties that govern these processes can be described. In particular,

20

accurate predictions for polar substances depend on a sound knowledge of biodegradation rate constants

21

but high-quality experimental biodegradation data are lacking for most chemicals in commerce, and

22

would, in any case, not be available in a safe-by-design context.11,12

23

Accurately determining biodegradation rate constants is of great interest not only in the context of

24

wastewater treatment but also because biodegradation is the the main transformation process reducing

25

exposure to chemicals in different environmental compartments, including aerobic soils and water-

26

sediment interfaces.13,14 As a result, experimental procedures to assess microbial degradation in these

27

environments have been extensively developed and are frequently used in risk assessment.13,15‚Äì17

28

However, these experiments are costly and the number of substances to be evaluated is very large, which

29

is why in silico approaches are increasingly promoted as an alternative.18 The preferred approach is to

30

build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based solely on features that can be

31

calculated from chemical structures, rather than including properties that require physical measurement,

32

thus enabling the evaluation of millions of existing and potentially new chemicals.12,19,20 The currently

33

most used QSAR models for biodegradation is the suite of BIOWIN models, which is provided through

34

EPI Suite and also used to internally estimate biodegradation in STPWIN.

35

BIOWIN is a collection of models trained on small datasets and biodegradation ratings derived from

36

expert judgment.21 Many recent studies continue using the expert-judgment datasets to develop

37

predictive models. 22,23 which limits their generalizability. Therefore, we believe that new, and more

38

accurate models should be based on experimental data rather than expert judgment, a need that other

39

researchers have also recognized. Notably, Wang et al.24 developed linear regression-based QSAR

40

models based on rate constants derived from batch experiments with activated sludge from a WWTP.

41

Their models provided new insights into biodegradation mechanisms under both aerobic and anaerobic

42

conditions, but they were validated with only 10 chemicals. Differently, Nolte et al.25 built QSAR

43

models but instead of data from batch experiments they used monitoring data from full-scale WWTPs

44

to derive biodegradation rate constants, and built models for predicting removals of 69 compounds (51

45

train & 18 test). While these efforts using experimental data are valuable contributions, they are limited

46

by the small number of substances covered. Later, Chirico et al.26 , profiting from advances in high-

47

resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), were able to collect data for over 300 compounds, enabling the

48

development of models for nearly 100 compounds (70 for training and 28 for testing). The authors

49

acknowledged the challenge of creating a global model due to the heterogeneity of the data and the

50

possibility that these relationships are non-linear.

51

Given the complex relationship between chemical structure, microbial degradation, and other processes

52

occurring in wastewater treatment, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative for

53

predictive modeling.20,27 ML methods help identify patterns between a large number of features and the

54

target variable, making them well-suited for use within quantitative structure-activity relationship

55

(QSAR) modeling frameworks.20 Furthermore, many ML algorithms are designed to prevent overfitting,

56

even when dealing with high-dimensional data, which is a common obstacle in traditional QSAR models

57

that rely on multiple linear regression.28 While there are numerous examples of ML-assisted QSAR

58

models for various endpoints, mostly related to toxicity, biodegradation models are less common. A

59

prominent example by Zhang et al.29 demonstrated high performance (i.e., 85.1% accuracy) using

60

machine learning to classify compounds as readily- or not readily-biodegradable. However, this model

61

is not suited for more refined persistence and exposire assesment because it does not provide a

62

continuous metric such as percent removal.

63

Building on the unprecedented opportunities provided by advances in HRMS and the potential of ML,

64

we recognize a unique opportunity to address the limitations of previous studies by using ML and

65

monitoring data from WWTPs to develop general predictive models for removal of chemicals in

66

WWTPs. Our goal is to use to establish a robust benchmark for future modeling advancements. To this

67

end, we explore a wide variety of algorithms and molecular representations to illustrate the applicability

68

and current limits of ML for this task. We do this in a fully transparent way by developing an open-

69

source library and providing a carefully curated database for others to use and explore alternative

70

modeling approaches.

Methods

72

2.1

Description of available data

73

The data used in this study consist of information on 1153 unique chemical substances monitored in 44

74

WWTPs across Australia, Sweden, and Switzerland; all these plants employ conventional treatment with

75

activated sludge. These data were compiled from four independent datasets (i.e., AMAR, AUS, SNF

76

and SWE2), which do not cover the exact same chemical substances; that is, out of the 1153, 751

77

substances are unique to one of the datasets and 402 are found in two or more datasets. Further details

78

about the sources and experimental procedures of each dataset are explained in the Supplemental

79

Information (SI) Section S1. The datasets also vary in their chemical identification methods and hence

80

certainty in structural annotation: specifically, SNF uses reference standards (level 1 confidence as

81

described Schymanski et al.30), whereas for the other datasets structural annotation is done by library

82

spectrum match (level 2 confidence30). These differences did not impact the model performance as

83

further discussed in the SI Section 1. Moreover, a table summarizing key information on these datasets

84

is provided in the SI document WWTP_descriptions.xlsx, and the complete database is available in the

85

ERIC open repository (EAWAG Research Data Institutional Collection: https://opendata.eawag.ch/)

86

and as part of the Renku project associated with this publication (renkulab.io/projects/fenner-

87

labs/projects/pepper).

88

Our target variable for modeling is breakthrough, which is defined as the ratio of the concentration (C)

89

detected in the effluent to the concentration detected in the influent for each substance in each of the

90

WWTPs (eq. 1); thus, breakthrough may be interpreted as the fraction of each substance that is not

91

removed during treatment.

Model development

95

A computational workflow, PEPPER (pepper-lab ¬∑ PyPI), was developed as an open-source library to

96

build all models in this study. One of the benefits of PEPPER is that all data processing methods and

97

models developed are documented in detail so users can reproduce our work entirely. Further details of

98

PEPPER are provided in the SI section S2.

2.3

100

We employed different levels of data curation and investigated their impact on model performance. The

101

lowest level of curation consisted in careful treatment of duplicates, preprocessing of chemical structures

Curation of the database

102

and excluding substances with concentrations in influent below the limits of detection (even if they were

103

found in effluent samples); further details in the SI Section S3.

104

The role of WWTP technology: WWTPs used in this study all employ conventional activated sludge

105

processes. Of the 44 plants, 40 include a nitrifying-denitrifying step, which we refer to as nitrogen (N)-

106

eliminating plants. The nitrifying-denitrifying step is known to significantly impact the removal of

107

certain substances7, raising concerns about how combining data from these two types of plants could

108

affect model performance. We observed clear differences and concluded that restricting our model to

109

only data from N-eliminating plants results in a more homogeneous training set. A deeper discussion is

110

presented in the SI section S4.

111

Additional curation: We added five additional curation criteria that could influence prediction quality

112

and tested them systematically. These criteria are: (I) exclude substances for which breakthrough values

113

could be calculated for less than three WWTPs, because there is less confidence in whether these values

114

are representative of a wider range of treatment plants. (II) Exclude substances with breakthrough values

115

exceeding 120%, because these values could be the result of analytical errors or formation during

116

treatment (i.e., transformation products). (III) Exclude substances with high variability in breakthrough

117

values across plants, because we assume it is more challenging to establish a structure-activity

118

relationship as breakthrough seems to be widely affected by subtle changes in treatment conditions. (IV)

119

Exclude entries with effluent values below the limit of quantification (LOQ). (V) Exclude highly sorbing

120

or highly volatile substances because we expect that the majority of substances in this study are removed

121

via biodegradation so substances mainly removed by other mechanisms could introduce conflicting

122

information in the models. For the latter purpose, we calculated organic carbon-water partition

123

coefficients (KOC) and Henry‚Äôs law constants (H) of all substances using OPERA 2.9

124

(github.com/kmansouri/OPERA) and selected thresholds of 4000 L/kg and 10-5 atm-m3/mol,

125

respectively.

127

2.4

Descriptors

128

We calculated several molecular representations: as molecular descriptors: PaDEL31 and Mordred32,

129

as fingerprints: MACCS, Extended Connectivity fingerprints (ECFP; using RDKit33) and RDKit

130

Fingerprints. Additionally, we created a fingerprint (ePFP) by one-hot encoding to represent functional

131

groups that trigger a biotransformation rule according to enviPath (i.e., a prediction system for microbial

132

transformations.34 Further details about the descriptors are provided in the SI Section S5.

133

As regressors we tested five linear models (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Ridge Regressor,

134

Kernel Ridge Regressor (KR), Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor (SGD), and Linear Support

135

Vector Regressor (LSVR)), two ensemble regressors (Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost (AB)), a

136

Decision Tree Regressor (DT), a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP; a type of neural network), a Support

137

Vector Regressor with a radial basis function kernel (SVR), and a K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

138

(KNN). These algorithms cover a wide range of robust linear and non-linear methods, frequently used

139

in QSAR modeling.

140

All regressors were evaluated using 5-fold nested cross validation (CV) as explained in the SI Section

141

S6. This workflow ensures three key aspects: i) the model never sees the test set during optimization, ii)

142

optimization is validated over a wide range of molecules to prevent overfitting, iii) the performance of

143

the model is not determined using a single test set but instead 5 different sets that cover the whole

144

database. Model performance was assessed using the average coefficient of determination (R¬≤) and the

145

average root mean squared error (RMSE). Statistical analysis to investigate differences in performance

146

among models was performed using Pingouin,35 a python library for statistical analyses.

Results and discussion

148

3.1

Systematic evaluation of each dataset

149

To understand the quality and contribution of the different data sets, we analyzed them in terms of measured

150

breakthrough values and the chemical space covered. In Figure Figure 1.b, the box for each dataset contains

151

all measurements from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for chemical substances unique

152

to that dataset and Multiple refers to substances in at least two datasets. Notably, the SNF dataset

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

153

contributed several substances that frequently escaped treatment across different WWTPs. Since

154

substances in the SNF dataset were identified and quantified using reference standards, we also

155

investigated potential systematic differences in breakthrough values due to variations in analytical

156

methods. Figure S1 shows breakthrough values for substances shared between SNF and other datasets,

157

using median values for comparison. The results demonstrate that despite different analytical methods,

158

similar breakthrough values were obtained for the same substances. Even when differences occurred,

159

there was no consistent trend of under- or overestimation when using semi-quantitative area-based

160

methods to determine breakthrough. This finding has two key implications: (i) Consistent with recent

161

studies,26 area-based removal calculations are sufficient for monitoring chemical substance

162

breakthroughs from WWTPs, and (ii) The target substances in the SNF dataset are more poorly removed,

163

providing valuable examples for the model and enabling it to better identify which molecules tend to

164

escape treatment. The sampling campaign that resulted in the SNF dataset was designed to focus on

165

structurally complex micropollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, while the other datasets

166

are not restrictive in this sense and include many molecules which are easier to degrade (e.g., organic

167

acids, small peptides etc.).

168

We also analyzed the substances in each dataset in terms of their chemical structures. Figure 1.a shows

169

a two-dimensional representation of the chemical space of all the substances included in our dataset. We

170

used a t-stochastic-neighbors algorithm to group similar molecules, where similarity is based on the

171

Morgan circular fingerprints. This is a common procedure to visualize the chemical space but often

172

representations are not comparable. We therefore chose to reproduce the embedding of a recent

173

publication11 as shown in Figure 1.b, and mapped our substances within the same space of over 134‚Äô000

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

174

marketed chemicals. The figure shows that our dataset covers a wide chemical space with examples in

175

all major classes of organic chemicals. Nonetheless it also evident that most classes are only sparsely

176

covered. We also analyzed the individual datasets and found they covered similar sections of the space;

177

as shown in Figure 1 there is no clear clustering of any of the sets.

3.2

Evaluation of model performance ‚Äì Setting the benchmark by testing different
regressor-feature pairs

181

We developed models to predict breakthrough values based on chemical features by exploring various

182

combinations of regressors and feature sets. To ensure fair comparisons, each regressor-feature pair was

183

evaluated using the same training and testing splits, following the nested CV method explained in the

184

SI Section S6. The data used in this section was selected applying all the curation criteria described in

185

Section 2.3 as these are the data with the highest confidence; this set contains 462 compounds.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

186

Preliminary analysis showed very poor performance from DT, L-SVR, Ridge, KR, and MLR (see SI

187

Section S7, Figure S3), so we only discuss the results obtained for RF, SVR, GBR, KNN, GPR and AB.

188

The performances on unseen data for the best regressor-descriptor pairs are summarized Figure 2. All

Figure 2. Performance of models in unseen data. a) models are grouped by regressor type showing that RF
performs slightly better regardless of the descriptor of choice. b) models using RF as regressor are grouped by
descriptor type showing improved performance using MACCS and worst performance using ePFP

189

regressors have on average comparable performance, with RF performing slightly better than the other

190

regressors, regardless of the descriptors selected or the feature reduction methods. Further details about

191

the statistical significance of these differences are explained in the SI Section S8. For any given regressor

192

the differences in performance using different descriptors were also small but there is a tendency of

193

MACCS to perform better, exceptions are KNN and GPR where models using Mordred were superior.

194

Moreover, we found that overall ePFP was least effective for predicting breakthroughs, especially when

195

compared to MACCS which are also expert-defined substructure-based fingerprints. This poor

196

performance was unexpected as substructures included in the ePFP are known to trigger biological

197

transformations.36 However, since these rules are specific to enzymatic transformations, many

198

substances trigger only a small subset of rules, while many other rules remain untriggered. Among the

199

1,037 substances with valid breakthrough values, only 577 had unique fingerprints. In comparison, the

200

number of unique fingerprints using MACCS is significantly higher, with 909 unique fingerprints. We

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

201

therefore attribute the difference in performance between ePFP and MACCS fingerprints to the higher

202

incidence of collisions in ePFP and hence consider ePFP by themselves as insufficient for modeling.

203

Our analyses revealed that similar performance may be obtained with different combinations of

204

regressors and descriptors, however we conclude that there is a tendency of the RF-MACCS

205

combination to do better. Moreover, RF offers additional benefits: it performs well without feature

206

selection, is inherently robust, has an out-of-bag (OOB) option to reduce overfitting, and, as an ensemble

207

method, provides a measure of confidence in predictions. MACCS also have several advantages: i) they

208

are easy to interpret because they refer to substructures with clear definitions ii) they are calculated even

209

faster than traditional descriptors because calculations are limited to matching substructures iii) training

210

the models is also very fast because MACCS result in very short fingerprints (i.e., > 10 times smaller

211

than ECFPs). Interpretability is important for added confidence in the developed models and fast

212

calculations are particularly important when screening very large numbers of chemicals. Given these

213

advantages, we further optimized the MACCS-RF model.

214
215

3.3

Can we improve the models by adding more data during training?

216

Since we had explored the performance of a wide range of algorithms and features and all models

217

showed low predictive ability with unseen data, we explored whether performance could be improved

218

by additional training data. Specifically, we decided to focus on the quality of the data and aimed to

219

identify the criteria that defined the best training set. This is important for two main reasons: (i) to

220

optimize and select features using the most informative data, and (ii) to provide guidelines on which

221

types of data should or should not be included in future expansions of the database.

222

The results of retraining the RF-MACCS model with different training sets covering all possible

223

combinations of our additional curation criteria are shown in the SI Figure S4 in Section S9. The models

224

are tested on unseen subsets (size = 92) of the data with the highest confidence (size = 462). The concept

225

is to discern whether additional data with a higher uncertainty improves model performance or rather

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

226

introduces noise. Moreover, different criteria also mean a different training size which is also expected

227

to have an important effect on performance. The best performances were achieved using all curation

228

criteria and combination I+III, that is, the combination of only compounds for which data from at least

229

three WWTPs were available and only those for which the variability across plants was low (i.e.,

230

standard deviation in log units < 0.7). Most other sets have similar or worse performance. We opted for

231

combination (I+III) for further model development considering that a larger number of chemicals (856

232

compared to 369) in the training set leads to a more general model, and we consider that restricting the

233

domain of applicability does not compensate the small gain in performance.

234
235
236

3.4

Performance of the final model ‚Äì optimization and comparison to widely used
regulatory models

237

Optimization. Models were finally optimized by 5-fold CV using the subset that follows the curation

238

criteria explained in Section 3.3. We performed a randomized search over a large range of

239

hyperparameter combinations and later a grid search over a smaller range close to the best

240

combination found in the random search. When performance was the same, we gave priority to

241

simpler models (i.e., smaller number of trees, smaller depth and larger number of minimum samples

242

for a split). Further details are provided in the SI Section S10 and Figure S5. Finally, As previously

243

described by Sheridan et al.37 RF models often overestimate low values and underestimate high values.

244

To address this systematic bias, we applied a linear regression model to adjust the RF‚Äôs raw

245

predictions, following Sheridan‚Äôs method. In this approach, the linear model is fitted on training data

246

only and uses the relationship between RF predictions and actual breakthrough values from the

247

training set to produce adjusted predictions. When reporting the performance of our optimized model,

248

we refer to this adjusted prediction rather than the raw RF output.

249
250

Definition of applicability domain (AD). As the final step to characterize our model, we aimed to define

251

its domain of applicability. There is no established consensus on how AD must be defined but most

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

252

approaches use either similarity metrics or ensemble agreement metrics.37‚Äì41 Among similarity metrics,

253

the Tanimoto Similarity Index is widely used and has proven effective.42,43 This similarity measure is

254

calculated pairwise; it can be defined as the similarity to the most similar molecule (i.e.,

255

SimiliratyNearest) in the training set or as the average similarity to the five nearest molecules in the

256

training set (i.e., SimiliratyNearest5). A threshold is typically applied to determine whether a molecule

257

falls within the model‚Äôs domain of applicability. In our case, we tested both SimilarityNearest and

258

SimilarityNearest5. Rather than introducing a threshold, we investigated whether similarity to the

259

training set correlated with improved predictions by ranking our predictions based on similarity and

260

recalculating the RMSE as we progressively excluded a fraction of the set with the lowest similarity.

261

We evaluated the RMSE of 18 subsets, ranging from all data to the top 10% most similar data in 5%

262

increments. Figure S6 in the SI Section S11, shows that when SimilarityNearest is used, improvement

263

in RMSE is achieved only after removing nearly 80% of most dissimilar molecules. This suggests that,

264

in our case, SimilarityNearest alone is not such a useful metric for identifying good predictions.

265

We observed better performance when using SimilarityNearest5, but it also required removing a very

266

large portion of predictions before a clear improvement could be observed. These results indicate that,

267

if we were to apply a similarity metric, an arbitrary threshold would lead to unreliable results and an

268

optimized threshold (e.g., only top 20% most similar) would limit considerably the applicability of the

269

model.

270

We repeated this analysis, but instead of ranking based on similarity, we ranked predictions by the

271

standard deviation of the individual tree predictions in the ensemble (i.e., TreeSD). Here, we observed

272

a steady decrease in RMSE and increase in R2 as we removed predictions with the largest standard

273

deviations, indicating that predictions were more accurate when the trees agreed more closely. Overall,

274

standard deviation in the predictions of individual trees serves as a strong indicator of confidence in

275

predictions.

276

Interpretation of final model. Model performance on unseen data was lower than expected so

277

understanding the model‚Äôs decisions is important for confidence in predictions. We calculated feature

278

importances across the different folds in 5-fold CV. Figure S10 in the SI Section shows the importance

279

for the 10 most important features. Then we calculated the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

281

Figure 3. Feature importance. a) Shows the feature importance during 5-fold cross validation. b) shows the shapley additive

289

values; red represents the substructure was present and blue that it was not. For example, the presence of struct-134 (i.e.,
halogens) always contributed to larger breakthroughs. The opposite is observed for struct-139 (i.e., -OH) where its presence

290

always contributed to smaller breakthroughs.

291

Struct-134 (i.e., presence of -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) is both the most important feature during cross validation

292

and the substructure with the largest impact on predictions when present. Figure 3 shows how every

293

time a halogen is present the model assigns larger breakthrough values, which is in line with current

294

understanding of biodegradability.44,45 The absence of halogens (blue circles in struct-134 row) only

295

moderately contributes to lower breakthroughs. A similar tendency is observed for struct-165, which

296

refers to the presence of rings (both aromatic or aliphatic). If a ring structure is present, the model assigns

297

larger breakthroughs, although to a lesser extent than if halogens are present. And differently from the

298

halogens, the absence of rings highly contributes to lower breakthroughs, which can be observed from

299

the large negative values of the blue circles for struct-165. Two more substructures have a similar

300

tendency (i.e., higher breakthrough when present), i.e., struct-77, which refers to the pattern N~*~N

301

where N is nitrogen, (*) is any atom and (~) is any bond, and struct-138, which refers to the pattern

302

Q~CH2~* where Q represents any atom which is not C or H. Struct-77 in many cases encodes the

303

presence of imidazole, which is common in many pharmaceuticals (e.g., antifungals such as

304

butoconazole) and is a moiety that is difficult to degrade. Guanidine-like substructures would also match

305

struct-77 and these are often found in pharmaceuticals (e.g., metformin a treatment against diabetes).

306

Struct-138 is more general, note that both Q and (*) could be nitrogen atoms too but the central atom

307

must be a CH2 which excludes imidazole, guanidine, carboxylic acids and amides. Common examples

308

of compounds that contain struct-138 are tertiary amines.

309

Struct-131 normally matched terminal N and O atoms, like alcohols, carboxylic acids and primary

310

amines which are expected to have low breakthroughs. Presence of struct-101 (8-membered rings or

311

larger where adjacent rings are counted as single ring) contributing to smaller breakthroughs is observed

312

and rather counterintuitive. Examples of compounds that match struct-101 and have low observed

313

breakthroughs include compounds with guanine-like substructures. Intuitively these aromatic rings are

314

not expected to be biodegradable but there are plenty of naturally occurring substances with these

315

substructures such as nucleotides and nucleosides. Differently, smaller aromatic rings (e.g., 6-membered

316

rings) which would encode struct-165 but not 101 are xenobiotic and presented larger breakthroughs,

317

and this explains the tendency of struct-101 as a driver of lower breakthroughs. Finally, struct-139

318

which refers to the presence -OH is also selected as an important predictor and its presence always leads

319

to smaller breakthroughs as expected.

320

Benchmarking model performance. Next, we compared the predictions of the optimized model with

321

those of the STPWIN tool from the EPI Suite, a tool developed by the US EPA and widely used in

322

regulation, alternatives assessment and even academic research.46 The agreement between the

323

monitoring data and predictions of both our models and STPWIN are shown in Figure 4.a.The RMSE

324

for our predictions was 0.62, compared to 0.92 for STPWIN predictions. The coefficient of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3n9gg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-0164 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

325

determination was 0.22 for our model and -0.70 for STPWIN. Recent assessment of the quality of

326

predictions of STPWIN is missing, however, previous studies have reported prediction errors within 1-

327

2 log units of magnitude for similar tools, such as SimpleTreat.6,47

328

We believe that the chosen test set of chemicals is particularly challenging for process-based models

329

such as STPWIN and SimpleTreat, as most molecules in this subset are removed primarily via

330

biodegradation, a complex mechanism that remains difficult to predict accurately.23 Both STPWIN and

331

SimpleTreat rely on physicochemical properties to estimate removal by various mechanisms, ultimately

332

combining these individual predictions for a total removal value.5 STPWIN in particular outputs values

333

for each individual mechanism, enabling us to calculate the fraction attributed to biodegradation. As

334

expected, nearly all predictions rely heavily on biodegradation, indicating that prediction accuracy

335

depends largely on the accuracy of the primary biodegradation rate constant. Similarly, Lautz et al.47

336

observed that errors were 10 times higher when using biodegradation rate constants predicted by

337

BIOWIN in comparison to using measured rate constants. Their study also confirmed that using plant-

338

specific reactor parameters did not improve predictions significantly compared to simply using default

339

values, which also highlight the enormous weight of biodegradation rate constants in the prediction

340

errors. Our modeling approach, which is purely data-driven but trained on a large set of actual WWTP

341

monitoring data, better predicts removals across a large range of compounds, despite the fact that it does

342

not explicitly account for different removal processes. We conclude that our model is an important

343

alternative for predicting removal in WWTPs, particularly for substances that are mainly removed by

344

biodegradation, where STPWIN and SimpleTreat are likely to fail as they need to rely on predictions by

345

BIOWIN.

346

Model application to relevant chemical space. To illustrate the utility of our model, we predicted

347

breakthrough for over 14‚Äô000 chemicals registered under REACH. This list of single organic chemicals

348

registered under REACH was compiled and curated by Arp & Hale12 In Figure 4.a, we present

349

prediction outcomes as percentage breakthrough to better illustrate the environmental significance. In

350

some cases, breakthrough values are largely overestimated leading to breakthrough up to 150%. For

351

nearly half of chemicals, the predicted breakthrough is below 20% and for 15% of chemicals the

352

breakthrough is predicted to be above 80%.

353

We also analyzed the relationship between the breakthrough and the confidence in predictions. Most

354

examples with a large confidence in predictions also have a large predicted breakthrough. These are

355

mostly substances with chlorine and fluorine as substituents. Substances with low breakthrough and

356

high confidence are mostly carboxylic acids, alcohols, ethers and guanine-like metabolites.

Conclusions

359

In this work, we present an approach to estimate the removal of micropollutants during wastewater

360

treatment. With our approach, models learn from increasingly available, semi-quantitative monitoring

361

data from WWTPs and are able to predict an expected breakthrough for a highly diverse set of organic

362

molecules. These predictions proved more reliable than existing process-based models that are widely

363

used in EU and US regulatory contexts, especially for molecules where no experimental

364

biotransformation kinetic data are available. This suggests that our model could be an important and

365

novel contribution to the toolbox of in silico models used for alternatives assessment, when evaluating

366

new molecules in industrial research and development, or even for exposure modeling in a risk

assessment context. We have here established a benchmark model, which is publicly available along

368

with the training data and the scripts necessary to reproduce the data curation process

369

(renkulab.io/projects/fenner-labs/projects/pepper). We anticipate that this benchmark and the highly

370

transparently curated data set that we provide will facilitate further developments in the field.
