Abstract

21

The molecular structure and wettability of a surface plays a major role in dissolved organic

22

matter (DOM) adsorption-desorption dynamics at water/solid interfaces. We studied the

23

retention dynamics of a model DOM (i.e., a polysaccharide) at the water/diamond and

24

water/goethite interface. In-situ adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to probe the

25

interfacial dynamicity of sorbed polysaccharide (PS) and its impact on surface wettability.

26

Experiments revealed distinct bonding and kinetic behavior that depended on the polarity of the

27

surface: goethite presented a higher adsorption capacity and binding strength but slower

28

adsorption kinetics, compared to the diamond. Further, 2D correlation IR spectroscopy

29

demonstrated surface polarity, surface loading and time alter the polysaccharide’s conformation

30

and self-assembly during adsorption and desorption. On goethite, electrostatic interactions with

31

the surface were followed by the formation of inter- and intra- molecular H-bonds between side

32

groups of polysaccharide chains, while at greater PS loading hydrophobic interactions between

33

PS groups became predominant. In contrast, the non-polar diamond surface promoted

34

hydrophobic interactions that governed polysaccharide retention initially; subsequently,

35

increased PS loading promoted H-bond formation between its charged hydrophilic groups. Both

36

PS-goethite and PS-diamond organo-mineral associations developed a hydrophobic character

37

(i.e., low wettability) upon PS adsorption. Thus, we posit the stronger retention of nonpolar

38

organic pollutants observed in soils might be caused, at least in part, by pollutant-organic

39

interactions within hydrophobic pockets in organo-mineral associations. This work helps us

40

understand and predict interactions of importance to environmental and engineering systems

41

such as the retention and transport of polar and nonpolar solutes in porous media.

1. Introduction

44

Terrestrial and aquatic environments contain a diversity of surfaces with varying degree of

45

polarity (i.e., hydrophobic and hydrophilic character) that impact the adsorption, transport and

46

transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Plants and soil microorganisms serve as

47

primary sources of DOM, which encompasses a diverse array of components, including DNA1-3,

48

RNA, antibody fragments1, 4-6, proteins7-10, peptides11, 12, lipids13-16, polysaccharides17-21, amino

49

acids22-25 and xenobitics26-30. The most important interaction between DOM and minerals in

50

natural systems is adsorption.31-33 Adsorption of DOM onto mineral surfaces may be driven by

51

several forces including hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, cation and/or water bridging, and

52

electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions.3, 7, 12, 31, 32, 34-39 In addition, DOM’s

53

molecular size, charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic character, conformation, functionality,

54

concentration, and solution composition (pH, ionic strength, and ionic composition) affect the

55

adsorption of DOM onto mineral surfaces.12, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38

56

DOM has been shown to assemble or aggregate on mineral surfaces in a sequential,

57

layer-by-layer manner. The initial layer, formed directly adjacent to the surface, attaches

58

primarily through hydrophilic (e.g., carboxylates) or amphiphilic (e.g., amines and amides)

59

groups. Once this foundational layer is established, it serves as a platform for more hydrophobic,

60

less polar organic molecules to adsorb, building up additional layers of organic matter.40, 41

61

Additionally, DOM attachment to mineral surfaces may occur in a non-uniform manner due to

62

changes in interfacial energies and surface topology. This process often mirrors characteristics of

63

partial wetting phenomena.31 In both sorption scenarios, the interfacial interactions are governed

64

by the hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic nature of the organic molecules, leading to

65

complex sorption behavior and multilayer formation under varying environmental conditions.

66

Therefore, the extent of hydrophobicity of a natural water/mineral interface could determine the

67

arrangement/conformation, surface coverage and bonding of DOM.

68

It is widely recognized that organic matter contributes to the hydrophobic characteristics

69

of soils.42-44. The alteration of mineral surfaces by natural organic matter directly impacts water-

70

driven geochemical processes in terrestrial environments, such as the transport and fate of

71

contaminants.11, 26, 45-47 Badía et al.48 observed differences in soil hydrophobicity among organic

72

matter-rich soils under various vegetation types. Soils beneath pine showed the highest water

73

repellency (i.e., more hydrophobic), whereas soils under meadow exhibited the lowest

74

repellency. Franco et al.49, 50 demonstrated that the primary contributor to hydrophobicity in

75

South Australia’s sandy soils is a polar wax, structurally similar to those found in regional plant

76

materials, such as eucalyptus trees. Similarly, Jiménez-Morillo et. al.51 suggested that the

77

intensity of soil water repellency is correlated with both the quantity and quality of soil organic

78

matter, particularly the content of fatty acids. In contrast, non-saponifiable lipids showed no

79

association with soil hydrophobicity.

80

The degree of hydrophobicity or water-repellency at water/mineral interfaces can be

81

quantified by water contact angle (WCA).52-54 Clabel et al.52, in their study on Amazonian

82

Spodosols, found a positive correlation between measured soil WCA values and the ratio of C-H

83

(aliphatic) to C=O (carbonyl) IR absorption band intensity. WCA values decreased down the soil

84

profile where the presence of organo-mineral associations is highly reduced, further suggesting

85

higher hydrophobicity in the presence of organic matter. Increases in hydrophobicity of organo-

86

mineral associations have been reported to occur after increases in surface loading of hydrophilic

87

DOM (i.e., Leonardite humic acid, LHA) sorbed on goethite (α-FeOOH), with adsorption of

88

LHA occurring via ligand exchange and/or hydrogen bonding33 . Additionally, the authors

89

observed that with higher LHA loadings the sorption isotherms transitioned from representing

90

monolayer coverage to multilayer adsorption, suggesting organic-organic interactions and

91

conformational changes occur in sorbed LHA. These organic-organic interactions may be driven

92

by van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions among LHA molecules. Increases in WCA have

93

also been observed after exchange of n-alkylammonium (6 ≤ n ≤ 15) cations on montmorillonite

94

and laponite clays that corresponded to decreased surface tension of the formed organo-clays.

95

Increased surface coverage and length of the organic molecule resulted in greater WCA values.55

96

Furthermore, organic coatings block the surface electrical charges and distorts the interlinked

97

and overlapping arrangement of the clay platelets.56 Using molecular dynamic simulations,

98

Underwood et al.39 explored the interactions between various organic molecules (nonpolar,

99

polar, ionic) and kaolinite's hydrated siloxane and hydroxyl surfaces. Their findings predict the

100

relative affinity of these molecules to kaolinite surfaces can shift between the hydroxylated and

101

silicate domains depending on the pH and the functional group of the organic molecule. Decane,

102

with minimal electrostatic charge, adsorbs primarily via van der Waals interactions on the

103

silicate surface. In contrast, decanoate anions adhere to the hydroxyl surface through an anion

104

exchange mechanism. Decanamine, capable of adsorbing to both the silicate and hydroxyl

105

surfaces, forms hydrogen bonds (N-H···O) with the hydroxyl groups, facilitated by water-

106

bridging interactions. In laboratory experiments, Yang et al.34, 35 demonstrated a peptide derived

107

from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a higher affinity for hydrophobic than for hydrophilic

108

surfaces, where peptide adsorption on the hydrophobic surface is enthalpically favored while

109

entropic contributions are more significant on the hydrophilic surface. Investigations of protein

110

(BSA) adsorption and desorption dynamics reported saturation at 50% surface coverage on a

111

hydrophobic (polystyrene) surface, while adsorption reached 95% saturation on the hydrophilic

112

(GeOH) surface. Additionally, the BSA molecules exhibited different conformations and

113

interaction strengths, with stronger binding on the hydrophilic surface via multiple H-bonds with

114

GeOH.57

115

Polysaccharides in soil and in fresh and marine waters, contribute significantly to the

116

composition of DOM, with major inputs from plants, microbes, algae, and phytoplankton.20, 58, 59

117

Branching and a variety of functional groups due to anionic, cationic and non-polar substitutions

118

on natural polysaccharide chains can result in derivatives exhibiting diverse hydrophobic,

119

hydrophilic and amphiphilic characteristics.58, 60-64 Several studies have shown that iron

120

oxyhydroxides, commonly found in soils and sediments (e.g., goethite, α-FeOOH), can

121

selectively adsorb and preserve polysaccharides with binding mechanisms that include hydrogen

122

bonding, and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, thereby promoting organic-organic

123

interactions at the mineral surface.18, 19, 64-66 Only a few studies have however investigated

124

potential conformational changes to polysaccharide molecules upon adsorption at mineral

125

interfaces, and these have mostly used EPS (extracellular polymeric substances), which is a

126

blend of protein, DNA/RNA, lipid and polysaccharide components.17-21 To the best of our

127

knowledge, this is the first study that shows how polysaccharide adsorption-desorption dynamics

128

and interfacial assembly alter the wettability of hydrophilic (i.e., goethite) and hydrophobic (i.e.,

129

diamond) surfaces. We study these phenomena over various polysaccharide surface loadings

130

using in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, concentration-dependent 2D-COS analyses, and water

131

contact angle measurements. The combination of molecular- and macro-scale measurements

132

yielded novel results, as reported herein, that reveal new insights about polysaccharide

133

conformational changes upon adsorption and desorption, and about the contribution of the

2.1. Materials

139

Goethite (α-FeOOH, pHpzc = 8.4)26, a representative hydrophilic surface with a water contact

140

angle (WCA) = 26.8°, was synthesized by the method of Schwertmann and Cornell67. The

141

synthesized product was characterized by XRD and FTIR to verify its purity (Figure S1a, b). The

142

goethite needles observed by transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin TEM)

143

had an average crystal length of 0.85 μm (Figure S1c) and a BET determined surface area of 59.1

144

m2 g-1. A monolithic diamond crystal (Figure S2A; GladiATR accessory, PIKE Technologies

145

Inc., MA) was used as a representative hydrophobic surface (surface area ≈ 7.1 × 10-6 m2 and

146

WCA = 105.0°). An amidated-high-methoxy pectin (Sigma-Aldrich, WI), a polysaccharide (PS),

147

was used to represent a multifunctional model biomolecule in our study (Figure 1A). This PS has

148

a MW of ≈ 71100 g mol-1. The galacturonic acid, methoxy and amide contents are 37.1, 58.7 and

149

156

([PS] = 3.5 – 196.9 μM; I ≈10 mM KCl and pH = 5.0 were used to simulate a low ionic strength

157

environment under mildly acidic conditions) over a hydrated goethite film formed at the surface

158

of a diamond ATR crystal (GladiATR accessory, PIKE Technologies, MA; Figure S2-A).

159

Adsorption of PS on the diamond crystal (i.e., the hydrophobic surface) was used to form the PS-

160

hydrophobic surface. Due to the lower surface area of the diamond crystal, a greater

161

concentration of PS was needed to acquire high quality IR spectra ([PS] = 14.1 – 196.9 μM). PS

162

adsorption was followed by a desorption experiment where a solution with the same background

163

electrolyte (no PS) was introduced until equilibrium. Experiments were replicated 3-4 times on

164

freshly prepared goethite films or clean diamond crystal surfaces under identical conditions. All

165

in-situ experiments were conducted under ambient atmosphere and using a close flow-through

166

system at a rate of 0.85 mL min-1 (flow velocity = 4.5 × 10-3 m s-1) using a peristaltic pump

167

(Cole-Parmer, IL). All spectra were collected by subtracting the spectrum of the background

168

electrolyte from the spectrum of each sample. Interfacial IR spectra were collected every 2 min

169

(200 scan time) with a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 from 4500 to 850 cm-1. After collection,

170

spectra received an atmospheric compensation, a nine-point Savitsky-Golay smoothing and

171

baseline correction to remove instrumental drift. All post-hoc manipulations were performed

172

using OPUS v.7.2 software (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA).

2.2.2. Modelling of Adsorption-Desorption Kinetics and Equilibrium Isotherms.

174

The total area under the curve of PS’ IR spectra, from 1800 to 900 cm-1, were used to probe the

175

extent of PS adsorption and desorption as a function of time. The Elovich and pseudo-first order

176

(PFO) models were used for adsorption and desorption of PS on goethite, respectively, due to

177

better fitting compared to other commonly used kinetic models. A simplified Elovich equation is

written as68

hydrophilic surfaces. The detailed theory and mathematical treatments for 2D-COS have been

previously explained70-73 In this study, the cross correlation analysis was performed on the

198

concentration-dependent FTIR spectral sets (i.e., dynamic spectra; Figures S3 and S4) of retained

199

PS at each surface at specific time points in the adsorption-desorption process. These time points

200

are referred to as: early adsorption stage: t1,ads = 2 min, equilibrium adsorption stage: te,ads = 56

201

and 163 min, and equilibrium desorption stage: te,des = 98 and 236 min, for diamond and goethite,

202

respectively. To generate concentration-dependent 2D correlation spectra, the original spectra

203

were subjected to subtraction of the spectra of background electrolyte solution and of the surface,

204

atmospheric compensation, smoothing, baseline correction and vector-normalization over the

205

2.2.4. Water Contact Angle Measurements.

211

Water contact angle (WCA) values were obtained with a Theta Lite 101 optical tensiometer

212

(Biolin Scientific, UK) using the sessile-drop method with an 8 μL droplet of the background

213

electrolyte solution. The immediate WCA was recorded at 10 ms from droplet contact and

214

reported values are the average of 4 – 12 measurements for every PS loading at each surface (see

215

details about PS-goethite and PS-diamond surface preparation below). The drop shape was

216

analyzed using the Young-Laplace equation.74-76 The relative humidity of the laboratory air

217

during air-drying and measurements was about 30% at room temperature.

218

Goethite thin-films were prepared by drop-casting 40 μL of a goethite suspension (1.68 g

219

L-1) onto microscope glass slides, as detailed in previous work.11, 26 This drop-casting method

220

results in thin and evenly-distributed goethite films (Figure S2 B-1). Drop-cast goethite films

221

were conditioned by gently passing over a background electrolyte solution (i.e., 10 mM KCl at

222

pH = 5.0). PS-goethite associations were then formed by introducing PS solutions ([PS] = 0.0 –

223

196.9 μM) at the surface of goethite films for 2 hrs using a microfluidic flow-through chamber

224

(Figure S2 B-2, 3). Similarly, PS-diamond associations were prepared on a spare diamond ATR

225

crystal using a flow-through cell used for in-situ ATR-FTIR experiments (Figure S2 A-2). WCA

226

measurements of the PS-goethite and PS-diamond associations were also conducted after a

227

desorption step using the same background electrolyte solution. All PS-diamond associations

228

were prepared individually, using the same diamond ATR crystal. For all in-situ ATR-FTIR

229

experiments, surface preparation and WCA measurements were conducted at room temperature

230

(22 °C ± 1) under N2 flow.

3.1. Dynamics of Polysaccharide Adsorption-Desorption.

234

Representative interfacial ATR-FTIR spectra of polysaccharide (PS) acquired during adsorption-

235

desorption experiments at the goethite and diamond surfaces can be seen in Figure 1B. The

236

carbonyl of methyl ester (ν(C=O)e), amide (νs(C=O)a) and carboxylate (νas(C=O)c) groups are

237

present at ~1747, 1655, and 1593 cm-1, respectively, while the N-H in amide (δ(NH)a) occurs at

238

~1550 cm-1. At lower wavenumbers, PS backbone peaks corresponding to glycosidic bond

239

(νas(COC)g) and pyranose ring (ν(CC)(CO)r) are located at 1146 and 1020 cm-1, respectively.

240

Detailed peak assignments are shown in Table S1.

246

The evolution of IR bands indicates more PS was retained at the goethite than at the

247

diamond surface upon adsorption and desorption (Figures 1B and 2). Differences in the extent of

248

retention result from the variety of ionic, polar and non-polar groups of PS and from the

249

chemistry of the surfaces. For instance, carboxylate groups (1593 cm-1) predominate at the early

250

stage of PS adsorption on goethite (Figure 1B, top panel) due to preferential interaction of this

251

anionic group with the positively charged surface of goethite (pHzpc = 8.2).26 Conversely, methyl

252

ester (1747 cm-1) and amide (1655 cm-1) groups seem to initiate adsorption of PS at the diamond

surface (Figure 1B, bottom panel). Furthermore, in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopic results (Figure

254

1B) reveal the presence of two distinct surface complexes, namely, a solvent-separated ion pair

255

PS) through the carboxylate group (νas(C=O)c at 1592 cm-1). Both complexes are classified as

258

outer-sphere complexes (SIP = water-bridge H-bonds and CIP = electrostatic interactions). In-

259

situ time-resolved spectra also show that CIP complexes are slowly desorbed (less reversible)

260

and become the predominant species with more surface dehydration (Figure 1B). In contrast to

261

previous work33, 40, 77, our data shows no evidence for direct inner-sphere coordination (i.e.,

262

ligand-exchange mechanism) between the O-containing functional groups of the PS chains and

263

the Fe(III) atom present at the surface of goethite (i.e., no shift in IR peak positions). Our results

264

indicate PS adsorption is more likely driven by electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with

265

≡FeOH and ≡FeOH2+ sites at the goethite surface.

) and amide (νs(C=O)a at 1651 cm-1) groups, and a contact ion pair (CIP, ≡FeO(H)+⸱⸱⸱-O(O=C)-

266

PS adsorption at the goethite and diamond surfaces followed the Elovich and pseudo-

267

first-order (PFO) kinetic models, respectively (Figure 2, Table 1). Since the steepness of the

268

kinetic curves illustrate the initial rate of adsorption, we can qualitatively state that PS adsorbs

more slowly but to a greater extent on goethite compared to diamond. This is most likely due to

270

the greater surface area and heterogeneity of bonding energies at goethite’s surface sites.7, 78 We

271

suggest that greater surface heterogeneity (e.g., energy barriers, active sites, surface roughness,

272

electrostatic forces) on goethite may lead to multiple surface-associated reactions that result in

273

logarithmic adsorption kinetics throughout the adsorption process. This is in contrast to PS

274

adsorption on diamond where PFO driven adsorption kinetics is expected due to the homogenous

275

and monolithic diamond surface. It has also been suggested that organic-organic interactions

surface contributes to surface energy heterogeneity.7, 79

281

The adsorption rate constant values derived from the Elovich (α, for goethite) and PFO

282

(k1,ads, for diamond) models increased as the initial PS concentration and surface loading

283

increased (Table 1). The activation energy distribution coefficient (i.e., β in the Elovich kinetic

284

model), however decreased with PS surface loading on goethite. As Zhang and Stanforth78 have

285

suggested, adsorption of PS may be limited by a narrow range of energetic barriers resulting

286

from increased PS loading, which in turn may promote faster surface reactions as indicated by

287

increased α values. The desorption rate constants (k1,des) increase linearly with rising PS surface

288

loading at the goethite surface; however, k1,des values remain approximately constant at the

289

diamond surface, except at [PS] = 14.1 μM, where a slower k1,des is observed. The later is likely

290

due to a concentration independent trend of k1,des values when [PS] is greater than 14.1 μM. In

291

general, PS presented faster adsorption than desorption kinetics at the diamond surface whereas

faster desorption kinetics compared to adsorption were observed on goethite (Figure 2c). Note

the later is a qualitative assessment only since the actual numbers presented in Table 1 cannot be

The Langmuir equilibrium isotherms of retained PS at the end of adsorption and

299

desorption experiments indicate that, at the highest PS loading, ~73% of adsorbed PS remained

300

on the goethite surface after desorption whereas ~25% remained adsorbed on the diamond

301

surface after desorption (Figure 2 b and d). Langmuir parameters also show goethite has a

302

stronger affinity (KL) for PS molecules and a greater adsorption capacity (A∞) after desorption

303

compared to the diamond (Table 2). The greater affinity and capacity of goethite arises from its

304

hydrophilic surface that is energetically favorable for adsorption of PS via its ionic and polar

305

groups. PS interacts with the hydrophobic diamond surface via its nonpolar methyl groups which

306

limit sorption strength and capacity. After desorption, when the loosely bonded and bulk PS are

lost, the KL values are elevated. The PS adsorption-desorption envelopes (Figure 2), however,

308

depend strongly on the polarity of the surface and on PS loading, with more relative desorption

309

from the diamond surface. Similar results were observed by Jeyachandran et al. 57, where protein

310

(BSA) molecules adsorbed on GeOH via multiple hydrogen bonding, resulted in stronger

311

interactions than with a polyester hydrophobic surface. Consequently, very little BSA was

312

desorbed from the hydrophilic surface, whereas significant desorption (60%) occurred from the

313

polyester surface.

adsorption stage: te,ads = 56 and 163 min, and equilibrium desorption stage: te,des = 98 and 236

340

cross-peaks are shown over each panel. Correlation values are shown in the legend.

341
342
343

The concentration-dependent sequence of interfacial events on the diamond surface
during the early stage of adsorption, t1,ads= 2 min, can be illustrated as follows:
Amide

Methyl ester

Carboxylate

 s  C=O a /   NH a    C=O e   as  C=O c
(1655 cm 1 )

(1551 cm1 )

(1749 cm1 )

(Seq. 1)

(1597 cm1 )

344

These results indicate amide groups have a greater relative contribution to the spectra at low PS

345

loading whereas carboxylate groups’ relative contribution to the spectra is highest at high PS

346

loading. The initial appearance of the amide groups (the amphiphilic component of PS), followed

347

by the methyl ester groups, indicates the formation of multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds

348

between the NH2+ and C=O moieties of alkylamide and methylester groups on the diamond.

349

With increased PS loading, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions occur between the

350

methyl-containing (e.g., alkylamide, methylester) residues of PS and the diamond. We therefore

351

suggest hydrophobic pockets form directly adjacent to the diamond surface as more PS is

352

adsorbed (Figure 5). The high relative contribution of carboxylate-containing groups at the

353

highest PS loading leads to the formation of electrostatic interactions between NH2+ and COO-

354

groups. As will be discussed in the next section, this sequence of events increases the

355

hydrophilicity of the PS-diamond surface during the early stage of PS adsorption on the diamond

356

surface.

357
358

At the equilibrium stage of adsorption, te,ads= 56 min, the sequence of interfacial events
caused by a concentration-dependent perturbation on the diamond becomes:

(1547 cm1 )

(1602 cm1 )

(Seq. 2)

(1749 cm 1 )

359

Increasing PS surface coverage results in increased relative contribution from alkylamide,

360

carboxylate and methyl ester groups. These results suggest inter- and intra- molecular

361

electrostatic interactions (NH2+ and COO- groups) and then H-bonding (NH2+ and C=O groups)

362

of adsorbed PS intensify as PS surface coverage increases. The formation of H-bonds between

363

PS chains also stabilizes the charge distribution of charged groups in the hydrophilic core of the

364

initial PS-diamond association (Figure 5). Compared to results for the early stage of adsorption,

365

the fact that methyl ester groups appear last at the equilibrium stage of adsorption suggests a

366

reversal in surface polarity of the PS-diamond association (i.e., becomes more hydrophobic).

367
368

Desorption of PS from the diamond surface led to a new sequence of spectral events for
retained IR bands at the equilibrium stage of desorption, as follows:
Carboxylate

Amide

Methyl ester

 as  C=O c   s  C=O a /   NH a    C=O e
(1592 cm 1 )

(1655 cm 1 )

(1545 cm 1 )

(Seq. 3)

(1751 cm 1 )

369

As reflected by this sequence, upon rehydration, the carboxylate and amide PS residues have a

370

greater relative contribution at low PS concentration at the diamond surface. Rehydration of an

371

organo-mineral association enhances hydrophilic interactions by increasing water bridges within

372

the organic layer33, ultimately leading to the desorption of hydrophilic components. However,

373

the relatively more hydrophobic methyl ester residues remain at the diamond surface due to

374

stronger hydrophobic interactions through their aliphatic carbons, minimizing exposure to polar

375

water molecules. We can infer that the hydrophilic components within the PS assembly are more

376

prone to water retention when a thinner PS layer is adsorbed on the diamond. The thinner PS

377

layer also has fewer hydrophobic zones to counterbalance the increased molecular disorder from

378

hydration. Conversely, a thicker PS layer stabilizes the organic-organic association with a more

379

extensive network of hydrophobic zones, thus minimizing conformational disruptions due to the

380

variety of inter- and intramolecular van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. In general,

381

desorption seems to increase the fluidity of organic-organic interactions that promotes

382

conformational changes and self-assembly of PS molecular fragments within the organic layer.

383

The concentration-dependent sequence of spectral events at the early stage of PS

384

adsorption, t1,ads= 2 min, on goethite can be interpreted as follows:
Carboxylate

Amide

Methyl ester

 as  C=O c   s  C=O a /   NH a    C=O e
(1607 cm 1 )

(1655 cm1 )

(1548 cm1 )

(Seq. 4)

(1745 cm1 )

385

On the basis of this sequence and the phase transitions of observed functional groups, at low

386

concentrations, PS chains first interact with the goethite surface mainly via electrostatic

387

attractive forces with carboxylate groups (i.e., ≡FeOH2+‧‧‧-O(O=C)-PS and/or ≡FeOH‧‧‧(OH2)‧‧‧-

388

O(O=C)-PS). At this early stage of adsorption, the goethite surface is still partly hydrated (Figure

389

1) so that solvent-separated ion pairs (SIP) might be favored (i.e., ≡FeOH‧‧‧(OH2)‧‧‧-O(OC=)-PS).

390

With increased PS concentration, the amide and methylester groups’ relative contribution to

391

interfacial interactions develops by the formation of H-bonds between these PS’ groups

392

(PS−C=O⋯HN-PS); these interactions ultimately decrease surface hydrophilicity. Repulsive

393

electrostatic forces between the N-amide of PS and the protonated surface hydroxyl groups of

394

goethite keeps this positively charged group away from the goethite interface. However, it has

395

been suggested that amide groups in amidated-PS strengthen the self-assembly structure by H-

396

bond formation (i.e., organic-organic interactions) at low pH where electrostatic repulsion

397

between the chains is minimized.84 In our study, the negative repulsive force within PS chains,

398

originating from carboxylate residues (37.1% substitution), is minimized by the interaction with

399

goethite.

400
401

At the equilibrium stage of PS adsorption on goethite (te,ads= 163 min), the concentrationdependent sequence of interfacial events is:

402

With low PS concentrations, relatively more carboxylate residues adsorb at the goethite surface,

403

forming contact ion pairs (CIP, ≡FeO(H)+⸱⸱⸱-O(O=C)-PS) coupled with surface dehydration

404

(Figure 1). This arrangement results in increased dehydration or water exclusion, leading to the

405

formation of a less hydrophilic surface. With increased PS surface coverage (i.e., concentration)

406

and water exclusion, hydrophobic and inter- and intra- chain organic-organic interactions are

407

favored through methyl ester and amide residues. Our findings align well with the observations

408

of Petridis et al.,41 who demonstrated that organic compounds with varying hydrophobicity form

409

discrete zonal arrangements on a sapphire crystal (Al2O3, a hydrophilic surface), with glucose at

410

the mineral interface and stearic acid (a saturated fatty acid) bilayers staked over it. At the

411

highest PS concentrations, amide residues, which are amphiphilic, act as intermediates,

412

stabilizing the interactions among PS fragments via hydrogen bonding (e.g., NH‧‧‧O interactions)

413

and contributing to the overall adsorption network by forming water-bridges.

414
415

At the equilibrium stage of desorption on goethite (te,des = 236 min), the sequence of
intensity changes of the PS that remains adsorbed is as follows:
Carboxylate

Methyl ester

Amide

 as  C=O c    C=O e   s  C=O a /   NH a

416

Similar to the equilibrium stage of adsorption, the relative contribution of carboxylate groups to

417

the spectra is proportionally higher at low PS concentrations even after surface rehydration. This

418

suggests that electrostatic interactions between carboxylate and surface hydroxyl groups remain

419

intact. Some solvent-separated ion pairs (SIP complexes) may form due to partial rehydration,

420

though not fully (Figure 1). As discussed previously, methyl ester and amide residues contribute

421

to PS self-association via H-bonding. We suggest methyl esters on PS chains do not directly

422

interact with the goethite surface since the surface would prefer to interact with polar or charged

423

groups, pushing hydrophobic components away from the surface.41, 85 This potentially leads to

424

desorption of hydrophobic PS fragments. We posit lower relative PS desorption from the

425

goethite surface (compared to the diamond surface) results from a less fluid organo-mineral

426

interface inherent to the stronger (electrostatic) interaction between the carboxylate groups of PS

427

and the hydroxylated surface.

428

3.3. Polysaccharide Alters the Wettability of Goethite and Diamond.

429

Immediate water contact angle (WCA) measurements indicate wetting transitions occur on the

430

hydrophobic (i.e., diamond) and hydrophilic (i.e., goethite) surfaces as a function of PS surface

431

loading (Figure 4). Goethite’s surface becomes increasingly hydrophobic with increasing PS

432

loading (WCA = 27° at PS = 0 μM, 70° at PS = 40 μM, 99° at PS = 196 μM). In contrast, low

433

concentrations of PS make the PS-diamond surface less hydrophobic, but higher PS loadings

434

revert this trend (WCA = 105° at PS = 0 μM, 78° at PS = 3 μM, 103° at PS = 196 μM). Results

435

thus indicate a polar hydrophilic surface (i.e., goethite) becomes hydrophobic upon organic

436

matter adsorption whereas low levels of organic matter adsorption renders a hydrophobic surface

437

(i.e., diamond) relatively more hydrophilic, although the hydrophobic surface remains

438

hydrophobic at higher levels of organic matter adsorption. Regardless of the initial polarity of the

439

mineral surface, relatively high concentrations of surface-associated PS results in increased

440

surface hydrophobicity of the organo-mineral association (i.e., results in a hydrophobic particle).

441

The observed polarity transitions that occur upon PS adsorption on both goethite and the

442

diamond surface can be explained by the results of 2D-COS analyses. Polysaccharide adsorption

443

at both surfaces results in increases in WCA since, as shown by concentration-dependent 2D-

444

COS analysis, hydroneutral86 and hydrophobic residues interact causing the PS to self-associate

445

at the surface. Therefore, with increasing PS surface loading, hydrophobic pockets form at the

446

goethite and diamond surfaces that eventually lead to greater hydrophobicity (Figure 5). Hence,

447

results from WCA measurements suggest the polysaccharide chains undergo structural

448

rearrangement once adsorbed at the mineral surfaces, and that this structural rearrangement or

449

self-association is dependent on the polarity of the bare surface which dictates the initial

450

mechanism of interaction between the PS and the surface.

456

However, throughout the entire PS loading range, desorption decreased corresponding

457

WCA values for both surfaces. For example, at 196 μM PS the diamond’s WCA = 82.7° and

458

goethite’s WCA = 63.4° for desorption, compared to WCA = 103° and WCA = 99°, respectively,

459

for adsorption (Figure 4). We posit the introduction of background electrolyte to organo-mineral

460

associations during desorption causes conformational disruptions, which increase the hydrophilic

461

character of the surface by disturbing hydrophobic pockets and increasing water adsorption

462

within organic associations (i.e., surface rehydration, Figure 1). Overall, desorption of PS

463

molecular fragments from the organic coating results in decreased WCA and surface

464

hydrophobicity of the PS-mineral surfaces regardless of the hydrophobic nature of the initial

465

mineral surface (Figure 5). Water contact angle measurements support our 2D-COS analyses and

466

interpretation.

467

The sequential arrangement of PS chains on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces can be

468

described by adsorption reactions and their associated thermodynamic factors. On goethite,

469

initial PS adsorption results from strong electrostatic interactions (CIP, contact ion pair) between

470

the carboxylate groups of PS and goethite’s protonated (≡FeOH2+) surface, with concomitant

471

surface dehydration. This type of interactions are energetically favorable, with an increase in

472

system entropy and decrease in enthalpy. Importantly, this initial approach of PS towards the

473

goethite surface results in the more hydrophobic groups of the PS (e.g., methyl ester) to be

474

exposed to the aqueous phase producing a more hydrophobic surface (Figures 4 and 5). It is not

475

surprising then that subsequent PS molecules would approach and react with the initially

476

adsorbed PS via their more hydrophobic groups (methylester and alkylamide). On the

477

hydrophobic diamond surface, the adsorption behavior of the polysaccharide chains shifts. Here,

478

initial PS adsorption results from weak van der Waals interactions between primarily methylester

24

479

groups of the PS and the diamond’s surface; surface dehydration also occurs but to a lessen

480

extent. A consequence of this initial PS adsorption is that carboxylate groups are exposed to the

481

aqueous phase producing a more hydrophilic surface (Figures 4 and 5). In contrast to PS-

482

goethite, initial PS-diamond interactions decrease the entropy of the system because of the order

483

imposed to water molecules by the ionic carboxylate group.

interfacial adsorption sequence of PS groups was obtained from concentration-dependent 2D

488

correlation analyses of FTIR spectra at an early stage adsorption, and at the equilibrium stage of

489

adsorption and desorption. The blue ribbon represents the associated water contact angle (surface

490

hydrophobicity) whereas the green ribbon represents the PS surface loading.

4. Conclusions

493

This study revealed the kinetics and mechanisms of polysaccharide adsorption-desorption and

494

self-assembly at hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces; these interactions ultimately resulted in

495

the formation of hydrophobic organo-mineral associations. Results show goethite’s adsorption

496

capacity and binding strength are higher than for the diamond. Contact angle measurements

497

indicate the hydrophilic surface (goethite) becomes hydrophobic upon organic polymer

498

adsorption whereas the hydrophobic surface (diamond) remains hydrophobic at high levels of

499

organic polymer adsorption. The structure of self-assembled polysaccharide residues vary as a

500

function of surface loading and time due to the formation of inter- and intra- molecular H-bonds.

501

These findings underscore the role of surface chemistry in driving the sequential and zonal

502

adsorption of PS chains onto mineral surfaces, where the nature of the PS functional groups

503

determines both adsorption dynamics and assembly at mineral interfaces. These results are also

504

relevant for understanding the retention and mobility of organic pollutants, and predict more

505

retention of non-polar organics and less retention of polar/ionic organics as hydrophobic organo-

506

mineral particles form.
