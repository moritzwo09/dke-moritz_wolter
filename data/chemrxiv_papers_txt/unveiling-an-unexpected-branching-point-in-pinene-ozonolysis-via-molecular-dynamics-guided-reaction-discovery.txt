Abstract
Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) significantly impact Earth’s climate and human health.
Although the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been recognized as the major
contributor to the atmospheric SOA budget, the mechanisms by which this process produces SOAforming highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) remain unclear. A major challenge is
navigating the complex chemical landscape of these transformations, which traditional hypothesisdriven methods fail to thoroughly investigate. Here, we explored the oxidation of α-pinene, a
critical atmospheric biogenic VOC, using a novel reaction discovery approach based on ab initio
molecular dynamics and state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques. Our approach successfully
identified all established reaction pathways of α-pinene ozonolysis, as well as discovered multiple
novel species and pathways without relying on a priori chemical knowledge. In particular, we
unveiled an unexpected branching point that leads to the rapid formation of alkoxy radicals, whose
high and diverse reactivity help to explain hitherto unexplained oxidation pathways suggested by
mass spectral peaks observed in α-pinene ozonolysis experiments. This branching point is likely
prevalent across a variety of atmospheric VOCs and could be crucial in establishing the missing
link to SOA-forming HOMs.

Organic aerosols are ubiquitous in the Earth’s atmosphere and have significant impacts on
human welfare1-3. On a regional level, they contribute to the formation of urban haze4,5, which
reduces visibility and endangers human health by increasing the risk of respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases6,7. At the global scale, they affect the Earth’s radiative balance through
both direct and indirect mechanisms3,8, with the former involving the scattering and absorption of
solar radiation while the latter altering cloud properties. Model studies indicate that organic aerosol
in general, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in particular9-11, constitute a substantial fraction
of the total number of aerosol particles in the atmosphere3,12. Unlike primary organic aerosol
(POA) that are directly emitted in particulate form, SOAs form through the clustering of lowvolatility compounds generated by the oxidation of gas-phase parent volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), which in turn originate from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources such as vegetation
or traffic. Some of these oxidation reactions can lead to highly oxygenated organic molecules
(HOMs) with extremely low volatility, that can either partition into preexisting aerosols, thus
increasing their size and mass, or even foster the formation of entirely new aerosol particles13-18.
Traditionally, the oxidation of atmospheric parental VOCs was believed to proceed in a
stepwise manner, with one oxidant (such as ozone and OH radical) attack adding at most 2 to 3
new oxygen-containing functional groups to the carbon backbone before forming closed-shell
products. These products typically require further oxidation cycles to generate HOMs. This
conventional perspective, however, strongly limits the potential yields of low-volatility HOMs, as
the intermediate products are prone to being scavenged by partitioning into condensed-phase
before undergoing another oxidation cycle. Recent research15 has demonstrated that under suitable
conditions, certain VOCs can undergo autoxidation, wherein a single oxidant attack leads (via
sequential unimolecular isomerization and O2 addition reactions) to products containing as many
as 10 new oxygen atoms. These findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive
understanding of parent VOC reactivities and their fates, especially the competition between
autoxidation and sequential oxidation. Such insights are crucial for accurately assessing regional
and global aerosol budgets and quantifying their consequential impacts on climate and health.
Except for polluted urban regions19-21, biogenic VOCs have been identified as the main
precursors for the global SOA budget, and total emissions of known biogenic SOA precursors are
estimated to be up to 10 times larger than their anthropogenic counterpart3. Monoterpenes, a family
of C10H16 compounds, comprise around 11% of global biogenic VOC emissions by mass12. They

are considered as a crucial class of precursors for the global SOA budget12,22,23, primarily owing
to their high reactivity (in particular, their tendency to undergo autoxidation) and the low volatility
of the numerous oxidation products. α-Pinene is the most emitted monoterpene, accounting for
approximately one third of the total emissions24. Its ozonolysis reaction (α-pinene + O3) is one of
the most efficient systems for SOA generation in the atmosphere25,26. Though significant efforts
have been made in understanding this important reaction over the past decades13,16,26-31, a
conclusive characterization linking α-pinene ozonolysis to the SOA-forming lowest-volatility
HOMs has not been reported32.
The initial steps of α-pinene ozonolysis reaction, and the formation of closed-shell
oxidation products with up to 4 to 5 oxygen atoms, are well documented and included, for example,
in the widely used Master Chemical Mechanism33 (MCM) for tropospheric degradation of VOCs.
Further sequential oxidation of α-pinene is also reasonably well described by automated reaction
mechanism generators such as the Generator of Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the
Atmosphere34,35 (GECKO-A). In contrast, the autoxidation pathways observed to lead to
substantial yields of aerosol-forming HOMs13,36 on a sub-second timescale are still poorly
understood despite some promising recent advances26. An issue complicating the experimental
analysis is that especially these autoxidation channels are only competitive in relatively clean
conditions (low reactant concentrations) – at the high concentrations required for the application
of spectroscopic techniques, for example, they are overwhelmed by termination reactions.
Currently, mass spectrometry is the principal analytical technique in identifying and characterizing
autoxidation pathways driving HOMs formation. However, without an added dimension of
separation37, mass spectrometric techniques cannot distinguish different molecules with the same
mass. Computational methods complement mass spectrometry by identifying the actual molecularlevel reaction steps behind the observed autoxidation process. However, thus far, only
experimental observation-based hypothesis-driven computational approaches that rely heavily on
chemical intuition have been used to identify autoxidation pathways. This limits the exploration
of complex reaction networks characterized by multiple competitive reaction pathways.
In contrast to the hypothesis-driven strategy, several discovery-based approaches have
recently been proposed to characterize the reaction space based on ab initio molecular dynamics
(MD)38-44. Some of these methods employ high temperatures and pressures to induce chemical
reactions38,43,44, whereas others accelerate the sampling of reactive events by applying an external

bias potential to a set of collective variables (CVs) that encode the generally slow degrees of
freedom of a system39,40. In this context, Raucci et al.40 proposed a workflow for reaction discovery
based on a CV derived from spectral graph theory 45 and the explore version of the on-the-fly
probability enhanced sampling method46 (OPESE). In this approach, a molecule is represented as
a graph whose vertices and edges are its atoms and chemical bonds, respectively. The maximum
eigenvalue of the symmetric adjacency matrix associated with the graph is then used as CV in
discovery simulations (Figure 1). This approach is suitable for blind sampling of reactive events
because it is based on a generic CV that does not require any a priori knowledge about the
reactivity of the system, allowing molecular dynamics simulations to freely explore new chemical
pathways40,47,48. Furthermore, the dynamics of the system is perturbed in a controlled way by a
barrier cutoff in OPESE, which sets a limit on the maximum value of the bias, and grants control
over the exploratory phase.

Figure 1. Schematic of the Reaction Discovery Approach. The intricate potential energy landscape arising
from the degradation of atmospheric VOCs is systematically explored through the enhanced sampling aided
approach, facilitating the enumeration of potential reaction pathways for subsequent high-level quantum
chemical calculations.

In this study, we unravel the complexity of α-pinene ozonolysis using this enhanced
sampling aided reaction discovery approach. In a three-step strategy, we first performed extensive

MD guided reaction discovery simulations, and then characterized the energetics of the newly
discovered pathways with high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations (up to CCSD(T)
level). Finally, a kinetic master equation approach was set up to understand the significance of the
newly observed reaction routes.
Without relying on human heuristic, we were able to uncover all the known reaction
pathways of the α-pinene ozonolysis reaction, including the ring-opening channel and the OH
roaming channels reported very recently by Iyer et al.26 and Klippenstein and Elliott49,
respectively, as well as discover several new species and reaction pathways that are of high
atmospheric relevance. In particular, our approach revealed the importance of a new reaction class
in α-pinene ozonolysis: the unimolecular rearrangement of alkyl radicals containing endoperoxide
functionalities, resulting in the formation of alkoxy radicals. This reaction type was investigated
in aromatic oxidation but found to be negligible for benzene50. In contrast, within the α-pinene
ozonolysis system, this reaction type becomes activated due to the excess energy retained from
preceding reaction steps. In addition, by exploiting the analogy between this reaction and a
previously reported epoxidation reaction51, we have identified both anthropogenic and biogenic
model systems in which the endoperoxy-alkyl rearrangement is competitive with O2 addition even
as a thermal reaction, i.e., without the chemical activation driven by the excess energy. A key
feature of this reaction is that it unimolecularly converts alkyl radicals into alkoxy radicals, and
thus – due to the versatility of alkoxy radical atmospheric chemistry – in effect opens new and
unanticipated branching points in atmospheric oxidation sequences. Considering the ubiquity of
endoperoxide functionalities in aromatic compounds and terpene-derived intermediates, such
branching points will offer crucial evidence in explaining the extensive array of as-yet unexplained
molecular compositions observed in mass spectrometric autoxidation experiments, and in
delineating their role in atmospheric aerosol formation.

Results
Thorough exploration of known -Pinene ozonolysis pathways via MD guided reaction
discovery
The initial steps of the α-pinene ozonolysis reaction follows the general mechanism of
cyclic alkene ozonolysis. The ozone molecule adds to the double bond, forming a primary ozonide,

which rapidly decomposes into a carbonyl-substituted Criegee Intermediate (CI; carbonyl oxide)
(Figure 2). Due to the asymmetry of the addition site, as well as the high barrier for rotation around
the O-O bond in the CI, there are four distinct CI isomers. According to MCM 33, the branching
ratios for their formation are reasonably similar33 (between 0.33 and 0.2). Rapid 1,4 hydrogen shift
channels are available to three of the four CI isomers, leading to vinyl hydroperoxide (VHP). These
in turn lose an OH radical to form “vinoxy” radicals (resonance-stabilized species with both alkyl
and alkoxy radical character), which add O 2 to form the first-generation peroxy radicals (RO2)
(Figure 2). The remaining CI isomer cannot undergo H-shifts, and thus either reacts bimolecularly
(for example with water vapor) or isomerizes into a dioxirane (Figure S1a) which then rearranges
or decomposes further to a variety of closed-shell products including carboxylic acids. This
“textbook” reaction sequence is unable to explain the experimentally observed autoxidation in the
α-pinene ozonolysis system, as all of the isomerization reactions of the first-generation RO2 are
far too slow to compete with bimolecular termination even in the cleanest conditions.30 Based on
theoretical calculations by Kurtén et al.30, these isomerization reactions can at most add one more
O2 to the carbon chain under atmospheric conditions. In 2021, Iyer et al.26 partially resolved this
problem by introducing an alternative reaction, where one of the vinoxy radicals undergoes a
chemically activated ring-opening, followed by O2 addition to make a new RO2 radical capable of
undergoing rapid unimolecular isomerization reactions. Experiments on selectively deuterated αpinene isomers32 have later confirmed that this reaction channel is indeed competitive – but also
demonstrate the existence of yet more still undiscovered reaction channels. Specifically, while the
reaction route forming closed-shell products with 7 or more O atoms in Iyer et al26, such route
inevitably involve H-shifts of the aldehydic H atom attached to the carbon that was originally the
secondary C atom in the double bond (carbon 3 in Meder et al.32). But the deuteration experiments
indicate that almost half of these products have not undergone such a reaction. This highlights the
existence of unaccounted processes essential for explaining the α-pinene ozonolysis experiments.

Figure 2) and its main subsequent steps proposed by Iyer et al26. In addition to these already-known
reaction channels, the sampling procedure produced a vast number of additional reaction
mechanisms following the ring-breaking of Vinoxy-c, summarized in Figure S1b. While these
reaction channels are also likely to be real (in the sense of being actual pathways on the potential
energy surface of the α-pinene + O3 + nO2 system), the vast majority of them are not competitive
with bimolecular sinks in the atmosphere, which typically constrain the lifetimes of alkyl radicals
to less than 10-6 s (due to the reaction with O2) and peroxy radicals to less than 0.01 s to 100 s (due
to reactions with either NOx or HO2, depending on the conditions). The lifetimes and fates of
alkoxy radicals are more structure-dependent52, but inevitably less than 10-3 s.
Notably, the reaction discovery engine also independently identified the OH roaming
pathway, which was recently proposed by Klippenstein and Elliott based on systematic theoretical
calculations49. The OH roaming was thought to be responsible for the production of
hydroxycarbonyl products during the dissociation of Criegee intermediates, as observed in the
pioneering experimental work53 and several recent works54,55 by Lester and co-workers. In the
context of α-pinene ozonolysis, Klippenstein and Elliott’s theoretical calculations49 indicate that
the OH roaming channels are kinetically significant, with a branching ratio of around 20% at room
temperature for stabilized VHPs, and this ratio can further increase at the lower temperatures
typical of the troposphere. However, the overall impact of the OH roaming channels is constrained
by the branching of stabilized VHPs. The initial step of OH roaming produces addition or
abstraction products with intact cyclobutane rings, which could possess energy exceeding the
dissociation threshold of the cyclobutane ring and then lead to ring-breaking products49. We found
a new ring-breaking product with two carbon-carbon double bonds, highlighted in green in Figure
2. This product forms when the dissociated OH abstracts a hydrogen atom from one of the two
spectator methyl groups, leading to cyclobutane ring cleavage. Such unsaturated products have a
high potential for subsequent oxidation reactions and could thereby contribute to the formation of
HOMs. Their oxidation paths and related products merit further in-depth studies in the future.
New branching point in α-pinene ozonolysis: endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement
One recurring structural motif in the novel channels discovered by the reaction discovery
engine was the high reactivity of alkyl radicals with endoperoxide (cyclic peroxide) substituents.
These were observed to undergo a variety of different isomerization reactions, typically resulting

in the conversion of an alkyl radical with an endoperoxide group into an alkoxy radical with an
epoxide or ether group. Due to lifetime constraint discussed above, most of these reaction channels
are unlikely to be competitive in the atmosphere. Similar rearrangement mechanisms have been
reported for other organic compounds. For instance, Zador et al.56 reported this mechanism in a
selected intermediate from the limonene + OH system. Additionally, calculations by Xu et al. 50
suggested that this rearrangement mechanism is excessively slow in the oxidation of benzene.
Nevertheless, for the radical depicted in blue in Figure 2, this reaction channel may have significant
yields due to large amount of excess energy retained from preceding reaction steps. Indeed, this
novel reaction channel occurs downstream of the ring-breaking mechanism proposed by Iyer et
al.26, and involves two new isomerization steps for the RB-RO2 species. The first step, with a
barrier of 16.3 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T) level, yields an alkyl radical with an endoperoxide group
(abbreviated EPO in Figure 2). The second step, with a CCSD(T) barrier of 17.9 kcal/mol, then
rearranges the EPO into an alkoxy radical with an epoxide group (abbreviated AOE).
To quantify the impact of excess energy in overcoming the above rearrangement channel
barriers, we conducted comprehensive kinetic master equation simulations covering the entire
potential energy surface of α-pinene ozonolysis along the targeted Criegee pathway (CI-a),
depicted in the upper panel of Figure 3. Within these simulations, the dissipation of excess energy
was addressed using a carefully evaluated molecular heat transfer model (Supplementary Materials
section 2). Our simulations unveiled that over 75% of RB species was formed within 2 ns after the
initial ozone attack on α-pinene (Figure S4), suggesting that RB species should retain a significant
portion of the 80 kcal/mol excess energy acquired in preceding reactions. Traditionally, it has been
assumed that such excess energy dissipates during the next O2 addition step (given its relatively
lengthy timescale of approximately 100 ns), thereby exerting minimal influence on subsequent
reaction steps. However, this assumption is challenged by our current simulation results: even
though excess energy may dissipate after the completion of O2 addition, the early-formed addition
product can retain sufficient energy to surmount the transition state (TS5 and TS6) barriers, leading
to the substantial formation of AOE within nanoseconds. The yield of this endoperoxy-alkyl
radical rearrangement channel exhibits a high sensitivity to the O2 addition rate. Here, we used a
model transition state with variable energies (while the O2 concentration was fixed at 51018 cm⁻3)
in simulations to control the effective pseudo-unimolecular O2 addition rate. We found that, at an
effective pseudo-unimolecular O2 addition rate of 1.9107 s⁻¹, the yield is approximately 9.0%,

while a rate of 9107 s⁻¹ elevates the yield to 31.5%, as is depicted in Figure 3. Assuming roughly
equal yields for the four Criegee-forming channels of α-pinene ozonolysis, the 31.5% yield from
the studied single channel translates into an overall yield of approximately 7.9% for the complete
α-pinene ozonolysis reaction (this percentage roughly equals to the full HOMs yield from α-pinene
ozonolysis). It is noteworthy that, in contrast to previous results30, the excess energy may also
accelerate the H-shift reaction of certain first-generation RO2 species derived from α-pinene,
enabling the nanosecond-scale formation of some H-shift products (Supplementary Materials
section 4).
Moreover, the reactant alkyl radical EPO is resonance-stabilized, indicating potential
reversibility of the competing O2 addition reaction, and a further enhancement of the endoperoxyalkyl radical rearrangement channel. However, additional kinetic master equation simulations
suggest that the impact of this back-reaction becomes significant only when the lifetime of the O2
addition product (denoted EPO-RO2 in Figure 2) is unrealistically long, exceeding 105 s
(Supplementary Materials section 5). Lowering the rearrangement reaction barrier to
approximately 14 kcal/mol is necessary for the back reaction to exert influence under realistic RO2
lifetimes of 1 s to 100 s. The dependence of the endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement channel
on the O2 addition product lifetime provides a typical example of the competition between kinetic
and thermodynamic control in O2 addition to resonance-stabilized alkyl radicals, as discussed for
example by the work of Wennberg and co-authors57 in the context of isoprene oxidation. While
not applicable to the α-pinene case, the O2 addition back-reaction may play a role in other
atmospherically relevant systems discussed in the subsequent section, for which the rearrangement
reaction barriers are in the range of 11 kcal/mol to 14 kcal/mol.

The substantial yield observed within the plausible pseudo-unimolecular O2 addition rate
range51,58,59 of 107 s-1 to 108 s-1 suggests that the newly identified endoperoxy-alkyl radical
rearrangement mechanism could be a major channel in α-pinene ozonolysis. The existence of this
rearrangement channel is supported by recent flow reactor experiments 60 which show that the yield

of 8-oxygen containing acyl peroxy radical is likely lower than estimated by Iyer et al. 26. This
indicates an alternative fate of one or more of the preceding intermediates, such as the
rearrangement of the endoperoxy-alkyl radical reported here. We note that in contrast to the
peroxide product from the O2 addition, the alkoxy radical product formed from the rearrangement
reaction is likely to have a large number of rapid reaction channels available that could help explain
the hitherto unexplained oxidation pathways suggested by the mass spectral peaks.
Potential routes to Highly Oxygenated Molecules
Potential follow-up reaction channels for the endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement
product AOE were explored (Supplementary Materials section 9). While the scission reaction
leading to acetone and a C7 product (AE-C7 in Figure 4a) is the fastest (this reaction was also
observed more frequently than others in the MD reaction discovery simulations), several H-shift
channels are likely to have non-negligible yields. In particular, kinetic master equation simulations
using the DFT barriers in Table S4 suggest that at 300 K the 1,7 H-shift of AOE (producing AEC10) has a rate roughly one tenth that of its scission reaction (producing AE-C7), converting to a
branching ratio of about 0.1 v.s. 0.9 for the two paths. O2 addition products (RO2) following AEC7 and AE-C10 contain multiple active sites for H-shifts (e.g., H atoms on the carbonyl carbon of
the aldehyde and on the carbons of the epoxide ring) and hence have a strong potential for further
autoxidation. According to the recently published structure activity relationship by Vereecken and
Noziere61, H-shifts on the aldehyde exhibit rates exceeding 1 s-1. We are unaware of any specific
structure activity relationship for H-shifts of RO2 containing an epoxide group. As a rough
estimate, we can assume that H atoms on cyclic ether (epoxide) carbons have similar reactivity as
H atoms on carbons with an acyclic ether substituent. For these, the structure activity relationship62
predicts H-shift rates up to 0.1 s-1. Our DFT calculations suggest that for AE-C7-RO2, the H-shifts
from the aldehyde and epoxide carbons have barriers of around 22 - 25 kcal/mol, corresponding
to rates exceeding 0.01 s-1 at the low barrier end. These rates align with the assumption that Hshifts from cyclic (epoxide) and acyclic ether carbons have similar rates. However, our calculations
predict somewhat lower rates than the structure activity relationship61 for H-shifts from the
aldehyde carbon. This is likely due to the steric hindrance caused by the epoxide ring on the carbon
chain in the current case. Nevertheless, these rates suggest that H-shift reactions following AE-C7
and AE-C10 could be competitive with their bimolecular sinks. Figure 4a shows potential routes

for autoxidation leading to HOMs with up to 10 or 11 oxygen atoms. Note that these routes are
only illustrative, as the order of H-shifts may vary due to their similar rates. Additionally, some of
the H-shift products from the epoxide (e.g., the 1,4 H-shift of AE-C10-RO2) will likely not retain
the epoxide ring intact, but instead form a carbonyl with O2 adding to the adjacent carbon. Many
of these routes likely contribute to the mass spectrometry peaks for C7 and C10 HOMs observed in
our flow reactor experiments (Figure 4b and 4c).

Endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement for other atmospheric compounds
The endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement mechanism discovered here can be thought
of as an extension of the epoxide-forming channel investigated early by Møller et al.51 Direct
experimental observation of that reaction was also achieved in the notable work of Klippenstein,
Lester, and their co-workers63. In that reaction, an alkyl radical adjacent to a hydroperoxy group
reacts to form a closed-shell epoxide and a OH radical. Møller et al.51 found that the thermal
reaction rate is competitive with O2 addition when the alkyl radical carbon has an OH substituent,
which can form a H-bond to an acceptor substituent on or adjacent to the other C atom in the
nascent epoxide ring. We carried out test calculations on a variety of systems (replacing the OOH
group with a cyclic peroxide) and found that the presence of the OH substituent on the alkyl radical
carbon can indeed significantly reduce the barrier of the newly discovered endoperoxy-alkyl
radical rearrangement channel. The corresponding reaction barriers for most of these tailored
molecules are approximately 11 kcal/mol to 14 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T) level (Supplementary
Materials section 7), in contrast to the 17.9 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T) level observed in the case of
α-pinene. While even these reduced barrier heights still do not correspond to competitive reaction
rates against O2 addition under thermalized conditions, simulations on model systems
(Supplementary Materials section 6) indicate that the reactions could have non-negligible yields
when considering a modest and plausible amount of excess energy (e.g., 20 kcal/mol) from
preceding steps. Despite not identifying such an OH substituent on the alkyl radical carbon in the
known or sampled α-pinene ozonolysis system, this structural motif is likely present in the
atmospheric oxidation of a diverse array of anthropogenic and biogenic compounds.
We identified three representative examples with endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement
reaction rates potentially competitive against O2 addition: the naturally emitted monoterpene αocimene (Figure 5), the industrial chemical 1,4 hexadiene (Figure S11a), and the terpenoid alcohol
geraniol, which is both naturally emitted and used in fragrances (Figure S11b). For the 1,4
hexadiene + OH and geraniol + OH systems, the corresponding endoperoxy-alkyl radical
rearrangement reaction barriers are 13.4 kcal/mol and 11 kcal/mol, respectively. Simulations on
model systems suggest that such barrier heights could result in about 10% and 40% yields,
respectively, when factoring in 20 kcal/mol of excess energy from preceding reaction steps.
Considering the potential reversibility of O2 addition, this yield could likely be increased further.

For the α-ocimene + OH system, the endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement reaction barrier is
only 3.1 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T) level, indicating a 100% yield even under thermalized
conditions without any excess energy. This typical example in the α-ocimene + OH system
highlights the importance of the new mechanism. Conventionally, hydroxyalkyl radicals are
expected to terminate the oxidation propagation by releasing the H atom to an O2, resulting in the
formation of closed-shell carbonyl co-products. However, the new mechanism suggests that these
intermediates do not necessarily conclude the oxidation propagation or the formation of HOMs.

Figure 5. The endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement reaction channel within the α-ocimene ozonolysis
system. The barrier for this endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement reaction is 3.1 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)
level, indicating a much faster reaction rate and 100% yield against its competing O2 addition reaction.

Discussion
These selected examples demonstrate that the endoperoxy-alkyl radical rearrangement
mechanism presented here is likely to be relatively common in atmospheric autoxidation
processes. OH groups, alkyl radical sites, endoperoxides and H-bond acceptor groups are
ubiquitous functionalities – the specific structural combination required to make the proposed
reaction pathway competitive is not implausibly restrictive. The main atmospheric implication of
the reaction is that it opens new and unexpected branching points in oxidation mechanisms: while
alkyl radicals, with a few exceptions, have traditionally been assumed to exclusively react with
O2, alkoxy radicals are arguably the most versatile species in atmospheric chemistry, and often
have multiple competing reaction channels available. A recurring theme of both smog chamber
and field studies of atmospheric oxidation has been the surprisingly large numbers of different

spectra). The unexpected branching points revealed by our new mechanism helps explain this
diversity.

Methods
Enhanced sampling aided reaction discovery
Our approach for conducting reaction discovery simulations combines a collective variable (CV)
derived from spectral graph theory40 and the explore variant of the On-the-fly Probability
Enhanced Sampling (OPESE) method.46 The workflow is thoroughly explained in a previous
publication40 and only briefly outlined here. The molecule is represented as a graph where vertices
and edges represent atoms and chemical bonds, respectively. The adjacency matrix A is associated
to the graph, and its elements aij indicates whether atoms i and j are connected by a chemical bond:

rij

aij =

n

1−(σ )
ij

rij
1−( )
σij

m

(1)

where ij represent the typical bond lengths between atoms of types i and j. We use the largest
eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A (denoted as max ) as collective variable in the enhanced
sampling simulations. max is real, positive, and non-degenerate, and its choice as a CV guarantees
translational, rotational and permutational invariance while preserving the chemical information
encoded in the molecular graph (max grows with the number of bonds and its value lies between
the average and maximum coordination number45).
The fluctuations of max are enhanced using the OPESE method, which builds the bias by
estimating the probability distribution of the CV on-the-fly. In particular, the bias is built as46:
𝑉𝑛 (𝑠) =

γ−1

𝑝𝑊𝑇(𝑠)

log ( 𝑛Z
β

n

+ ε)

(2)

where Zn is a normalization factor,  > 1 is the bias factor, and 𝑝𝑊𝑇 (𝑠) represents the welltempered distribution. An important feature of OPESE is the presence of a regularization term 
(𝜀 = 𝑒 −𝛽Δ𝐸/(1−1/𝛾) ) which is related to the maximum value of the bias that can be deposited. This
allows limiting the extent of exploration by preventing high energy transition states from being
visited, and thus, represents a key parameter to control the discovery phase.
The discovery engine is complemented by a reaction analysis module that enables detection
of new chemical species. We use the Open Babel64 program to identify chemical species in every
trajectory snapshot, converting the Cartesian coordinates of each frame into their corresponding

SMILES representations. The adjacency matrix A includes all the atoms present in the system. A
elements (aij) are computed using PLUMED65, with the ij parameters of Eq. 1 being equal to 1.6
Å for O-H, 1.9 Å for O-O, C-C, and C-O, and 1.2 Å for C-H and H-H. The exponents of the
switching functions are chosen as n = 6 and m = 10 to enforce a smooth behavior over a wide range
of distances. In the case of the VHP species, defining the graph with all the atoms in the system
predominantly resulted in sampling various conformers. Therefore, we conducted simulations
using a CV more tailored on a specific functional group that undergoes the OH decomposition
(i.e., the -COOH group in the VHP), observing several reactive pathways involving the formation
of OH radicals.
We started the discovery phase from -pinene and ozone. We performed multiple
molecular dynamics (0.5 ns each) setting the barrier value in OPES explore at 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500 kJ/mol. Whenever a new species was detected, we initiated new simulations from that
structure, again with multiple values of the  parameter in OPESE. Each new simulation was
carried out both in the presence and absence of O2. Each discovered species was first optimized at
DFT level (B3LYP/6-31+G(d)) to assess its stability. Then, the most relevant pathways were
characterized by computing transition states (TS) at a high level of theory (CCSD(T)), as explained
in the following section. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the CP2K 8.1166
software, combined with a development version of PLUMED 2.8.2.65 All simulations of the
discovery phase were conducted at the PM667 level of theory, with an integration time step of 0.5
fs. We sampled the NVT ensemble using the velocity rescaling thermostat,68 maintaining a
temperature of 300 K and a time constant of 100 fs.
Electronic structure calculations
A thorough exploration of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products was
conducted by systematically sampling their conformers using the Spartan’18 (Wavefunction, Inc)
program. The conformer sampling procedure was carried out using the MMFF method 69. All
conformers were first optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory70-73, and those within 2
kcal/mol in relative electronic energies of the lowest energy conformer were chosen to be
optimized at the ωB97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory74-76. Finally, only the lowest energy
conformer was chosen for the final single-point electronic energy calculation at the ROHFROCCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 level77-81 to correct the final energies. These calculations were

performed using the Molpro 2022.2.2 program.82 To obtain transition state (TS) structures, initial
guesses were generated in Spartan'18 and subsequently optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level
of theory using Gaussian 09, with relevant TS bond distances constrained. The selection of the
B3LYP functional for the initial TS calculations was based on its established capability to
determine TS structures. Unconstrained TS optimization at the same level of theory was then
performed immediately after the constrained optimization of the initial guess TS structures to
precisely locate the TS structures. Once the TS structures were identified, they underwent
conformer sampling in Spartan with relevant bonds being constrained. The resulting TS
conformers were optimized once again under constraint and subsequently subjected to
unconstrained TS optimization at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level in Gaussian 16. Finally, conformers
with relative electronic energies within 2 kcal/mol were optimized at the higher ωB97X-D/augcc-pVTZ level of theory. The lowest energy conformer was selected for the final single-point
electronic energy calculation at the ROHF-ROCCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 level using the Molpro
program82.
Kinetic master equation calculations
The RRKM simulations were carried out using the Master equation solver for multi-energy well
reactions (MESMER) program.83 The potential energy surface and the methods used until the
formation of the ring broken RO2 are identical to those used in our previous work26. Briefly, the
SimpleRRKM method in MESMER with Eckart tunneling was used to treat the initial association
reaction. Similar treatment was applied to the other intermediate complexes separated by transition
states. Approximations of the nascent energy allocation to both vinoxy and OH products resulting
from VHP decomposition were tackled employing the pseudo-isomerization methodology84. The
parameter m value, which controls the fraction of the density of states of the vinoxy radical to
spread the excess energy over, was set to 0.5. The O2 addition step of the ring-broken product RB
was treated using the SimpleRRKM method, employing a model transition state with variable
energies (while O2 concentration was fixed at 5×1018 cm⁻³) to modulate the effective pseudounimolecular addition rate within the range of about 107 s-1 to 108 s-1, a plausible rate range for O2
addition to vinoxy/alkyl radicals under atmospheric conditions51,58,59 (T = 298.15 K and P = 1 atm).
The O2 addition step for all other vinoxy/alkyl radicals was managed using the "Simple
Bimolecular Sink" method, wherein the rate is governed by an adjustable bimolecular loss rate

coefficient and an O2 "excess reactant" concentration of 5×1018 cm⁻³. The dissipation of the excess
energy through interaction with bath gases was regulated by the Edown parameter in MESMER
and was set to be 175 cm-1. This selection was guided by a molecular heat dissipation model
discussed in Section 2 of the Supplementary Materials. All intermediates were designated as
"modeled" throughout the simulations, with corresponding Lennard–Jones potentials assigned as
sigma = 6.5 Å and epsilon = 600 K. The simulation employed a grain size of 120 cm-1, with the
energy spanned by the grains of 60 kBT. The initial ozone concentration was set identical to our
prior work, at 1018 molecules cm⁻³, to minimize the overall simulation time. Previous test
calculations26 run with the more ambiently relevant ozone concentration (1012 molecules cm⁻³)
have shown that the initial ozone concentration did not influence results. This rationale aligns with
the observation that, beyond the initial association reaction, subsequent ozonolysis steps exhibit
independence from the initial ozone concentration.
Mass spectrometry experiments
A time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer with nitrate charger ions (NO 3-CIMS) was
used to detect the oxidation products of α-pinene ozonolysis at 600 ms reaction time. The
experiments were carried out in a quartz tube flow reactor. Liquid α-pinene (Sigma-Aldrich, purity
91%) was bubbled from a reservoir using a pure N2 flow. This was allowed to interact with ozone
produced by flowing synthetic air through an ozone generator equipped with a 184.9 nm (Hg
PenRay) lamp. The reaction time between α-pinene and ozone was controlled in two ways, 1) by
introducing the ozone into the flow reactor through an injector tube and consequently limiting
the α-pinene and ozone interaction time, and 2) by increasing the inlet flow through the reactor to
the mass spectrometer. High inlet flow rates of 20 – 30 liters per minute to achieve sub-second
reaction times were made possible by the use of the Multi-scheme chemical ionization inlet85
(MION). The experiments were conducted under atmospheric conditions.
