Abstract.
The oxidation of renewable resources is a promising process that has great potential in addressing the
climate change and building the circular economic, sustainable society and green chemical supply chain.
This study explores the application of ultrasound in oxidation processes using the wastewater treatment
as a case study. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are highly effective for degrading the pollutants
in wastewater through the generation of oxidative radicals, with ultrasound emerging as a promising
AOP method due to its mild conditions and synergistic potential with other methods. However,
ultrasound alone faces challenges in efficiently degrading complex compounds like azo dyes, partly due
to issues with cavitation bubble stability and non-uniform ultrasonic fields. Microfluidic reactor
combined with microbubble technology offers a solution to enhance ultrasound efficiency by improving
bubble stability and energy distribution. In this study, we investigate microbubble formation in a
microfluidic reactor with T-junction and flow-focusing inlets, aiming to enhance ultrasound-driven
AOPs. The flow-focusing design successfully generates relatively small and monodisperse bubbles
allowing for effective ultrasound application at 108.5 kHz using a piezoelectric transducer. Our results
demonstrate a relatively high H2O2 generation rate of 0.54 μM/s, among the highest reported in the
literature, and a methyl orange (MO) degradation efficiency of 35% in just 2.9 seconds - significantly
surpassing conventional systems and prior microfluidic studies. This work demonstrates the novelty of
integrating microbubble technology with microfluidic reactors to enhance the energy efficiency of
ultrasound - assisted oxidation processes, providing an efficient approach to the chemo-selective
conversion of renewable resources to high-value specialty chemicals that are inaccessible via
conventional routes.

1. Introduction
The United Nations estimates that the world population will grow to 9.8 billion by 2050. This
population inflation will drastically increase the demand for clean water, energy, food, and chemicals.
Sustainably meeting these demands while protecting our environment has become a priority, in line with
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, chemistry plays an important role in
addressing the challenge: “how to produce more chemicals while minimising detrimental impacts on
environment and society”. The progressive incorporation of renewable biomass resources, including
carbohydrates, lignin, polysaccharides, in the chemical industry is a game changing transition towards
building a circular and sustainable chemical supply chain. This contribution is driven by their carbonneutral nature and the massive capacity in producing a wide range of fuels and chemicals. However,
controlling the selective conversion of these polyfunctional substrates is a grand challenge, which is
currently limiting the great potential of biomass transformation to high-value specialty chemicals such as
bio-based products. Simply tuning temperature does not enable exquisite control of reaction selectivity,
thus, new technologies are needed. To address this selectivity challenge, a new concept of assisted
catalysis has emerged wherein chemical reactions are driven at room temperature by external triggers like
electrical potentials, photons, plasmons, and ultrasound.
Among these driving forces, ultrasound is witnessing a renaissance. When ultrasonic waves
propagate in a liquid, they change the density of the fluid and with sufficient acoustic intensity, these
waves disrupt the tensile forces of the liquid, creating micro-sized cavitation bubbles. Cavitation events
are accompanied by sudden increases in local pressure (up to several MPa) and local temperature (up to
thousands of °C). The effect of cavitation bubbles collapsing (or imploding) in a liquid depends on the
applied frequency. For instance, Low Frequency Ultrasound (LFUS) (20-80 kHz) generates small
quantities of large cavitation bubbles (~170 µm at 20 kHz). The bubble collapse mainly induces physical
effects such as shock waves, high speed jets, etc. Therefore, LFUS is used for the erosion/deagglomeration

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

of particles, breaking long chain polymers, etc. In contrast, High Frequency Ultrasound (HFUS, > 100
kHz) generates large number of small sized cavitation bubbles. The implosion of these bubbles, which is
substantially accelerated by the inertia of the surrounding fluid (inertial cavitation), propels radicals into
the bulk solution. These ultrasound-generated radicals can participate in chemical reactions and are highly
effective in the oxidation of aqueous pollutants in wastewater.
Wastewater treatment is a crucial environmental challenge, as industrial effluents from textile,
pharmaceutical, and agricultural sources often contain organic chemicals, leading to serious
environmental and health issues. Current wastewater remediation strategies include biotreatment,
membrane separation, microbial electrochemical systems, adsorption and advanced oxidation processes
(AOPs) (Sivanesan et al. 2024). Among these strategies, AOPs are particularly effective for degrading
persistent organic pollutants due to their ability of in situ generation of highly oxidative radical species
(Wang and Wang 2020). Advanced oxidation processes encompass a variety of methods, such as Fenton
reactions, photocatalysis, ozonation, electrocatalysis, and ultrasound (Fedorov et al. 2022). Ultrasound,
in particular, has emerged as a promising AOP due to its mild operating conditions, absence of chemical
additives, and synergistic enhancement when used alongside other treatment methods (Rayaroth et al.
2016). The fundamental mechanism of ultrasound in AOPs is based on the phenomenon of acoustic
cavitation, where rapid bubble expansion and collapse generate localized extreme temperatures and
pressures, leading to the formation of hydroxyl (•OH) and hydrogen (•H) radicals that effectively degrade
organic pollutants (Cintas and Luche 1999).
However, despite its potential, ultrasound treatment faces challenges, especially when applied to
recalcitrant nitrogen-containing compounds (Rayaroth et al. 2022, Shanker et al. 2017). These compounds
are commonly found in industrial wastewater, and current studies show limited degradation efficiency for
complex azo molecules like methyl orange (MO) when using ultrasound alone, with typical removal rates
falling below 10% (Cheng et al. 2012, Yuan et al. 2016). One reason for this low efficiency is the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

coalescence and rapid degassing of cavitation bubbles, which reduces their number and persistence (Yusuf
et al. 2024). Besides, conventional bulk ultrasound systems, often employing simple sonicators, typically
suffer from non-uniform ultrasonic fields and require high power over long duration to achieve moderate
removal rates. Hybrid methods, which combine ultrasound with other processes like photocatalysis or
ozonation, can improve degradation rates but come with drawbacks, such as the need for additional
catalysts, oxidants, and precisely controlled equipment (Amaniampong et al. 2024, Lee et al. 2023, Li et
al. 2023b).
To overcome these limitations, microfluidic reactors offer a promising alternative by allowing precise
control over mass and heat transfer, as well as improving the mixing process of liquid and gas phases
(Cordier et al. 2023, Li et al. 2023a, Volk et al. 2020). Recent study has shown the advantages of
ultrasound in a microfluidic chip, achieving a 9% removal rate in just 36 seconds due to uniform
ultrasound distribution and efficient energy transfer (Thangavadivel et al. 2014). Moreover, microbubble
technology, known for its high surface-area-to-volume ratio and enhanced mass transfer, has shown the
potential to increase hydroxyl radical production during acoustic cavitation (He et al. 2023, Janiak et al.
2023, Ma et al. 2020, Xiu et al. 2023). Stable microbubble formation within microfluidic reactors could
further improve ultrasound-driven AOP efficiency by promoting sustained cavitation and enhancing
radical generation (Rickel et al. 2018, Wan et al. 2008).
In this study, we investigate the synergy of microfluidics and sonochemistry, using the methyl orange
degradation in wastewater treatment as a case study to assess the efficiency of this approach in oxidation
processes. We firstly optimise the operation parameters of the new micro-sono-reactor with flow focusing
design on the MO degradation. Next, we evaluate the formation of microbubbles in the newly designed
flow-focusing microfluidic reactor and compare with the conventional reported T-junction microfluidic
reactor in literature. We assess the sonochemical efficiency of those microfluidic sonoreactors via the
generation rate of H2O2 driven by the microbubbles cavitation. Density Functional Theory (DFT)

calculations are performed to explain the mechanism of MO degradation under ultrasound conditions.
The role of surfactant to the MO degradation efficiency is also conducted.
2. Methods.
2.1. Materials
All chemicals (Sigma-Aldrich) were used without further purification, including 30% H2O2 solution,
methyl orange, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, KI, NaH2PO4·H2O, Na2HPO4·7H2O, KMnO4, (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), Acetone, Isopropanol, Methanol, Tween 20, PDMS, curing agent, NaOH.
2.2. Design and fabrication of microfluidic chips
In this study, we tested two designs of microfluidic sono-reactor to generate microbubbles. The first
one had the flow focusing setup (Figure 1a) and was used as the main sonoreactor for MO degradation.
The second one was the T-junction design with an intensive cavitation effect which had already reported
by Tadiono et al. and was used as a reference in our study (Figure 1a). The main dimension of T-junction
channel with 500 µm width, the width of side outlet is 200um. The height of the channel is 100 µm. The
dimensions of the flow focusing channel are 30 μm in constriction width, 100 μm in width, 400 μm in
spiral width, and 120 μm in height.
The microfluidics channel was fabricated using standard photolithography and soft-lithography
technologies. Briefly, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture was made using SYLGARDTM 184 (Dow
Corning) silicone elastomer base was mixed 10: 1 with SYLGARDTM 184 silicone elastomer curing
agent. Next, the mixture was placed in a vacuum chamber for 20 mins for degassing before being poured
over the microchannel silicon mold, and then placed in an oven at 70 °C for over 2 hours. After being
peeled from the mold, the inlet and outlet holes were punched with an 1-mm hole puncher. Finally, the
PDMS layer was bonded to a glass substrate using Plasma Cleaner (Harrick Plasma). Tubing was attached
to the inlet and outlet of the channel. The inlet tubing was further attached to a syringe pump. To maintain

the hydrophilicity of the microfluidic chip, the chip was treated in a freshly prepared 2% APTES solution
in acetone for 15 minutes at room temperature after bonding, followed by rinsing with acetone and MilliQ water (Siddique et al. 2017).

Figure 1. Two designs of microfluidic sonoreactor. (a) Flow focusing design. (b) T-function design.
2.3. Experimental setup
After obtaining the chips, the microfluidic sonoreactor was fabricated by securing a PZT-5H
piezoelectric ceramic disc (20 × 2.1 mm, model SMD20T21F1000R; Steiner & Martins, Inc.) 5 mm from
the spiral channel using epoxy resin. This piezoelectric ceramic disc was driven by a power amplifier (AG
1017L; T&C Power, Inc.) to generate ultrasound at a frequency of 108.5 kHz in radial vibration mode.
The supplied power was adjusted to find the optimized operating conditions.
The microfluidic sonoreactor was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX73
microscope). Two syringe pumps (SHENCHEN ISPLab02) were used to infuse the solution into the
microfluidic device at distinct flow rates. All syringes employed in this setup were HAMILTON glass
syringes. One syringe filled with the solution and the other left empty to serve as an air injection line. The
experimental setup scheme is presented in Figure 2. By adjusting the flow rate ratio of air to solution, we

generated uniform bubbles within the microchannel. The formation, size and stability of the bubble were
observed under the microscope. We evaluated the H2O2 concentration of effluent from T-junction and a
flow-focusing microfluidic reactor to demonstrate the enhancement of microbubble in the acoustic
cavitation. For the MO degradation experiment, all conditions remained the same, except that water was
replaced with a MO solution of known concentration (typically 5 mg/L).

microfluidic sonoreactor.
2.4. Analytical methods
The generation of H2O2 was measured using I3- spectrophotometric method reported in the literature
(Xiao et al. 2019). 0.5 M phosphate buffer stock solutions with pH 4.5 was prepared by dissolving 1.3790
g NaH2PO4·H2O and 0.0026 g Na2HPO4·7H2O in 100 mL Milli-Q water. 35 mM Mo(VI) solution was
obtained by dissolving 0.0618 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in 10 mL Milli-Q water. 1.2 M KI solution was

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

prepared by dissolving 19.92 g KI in 100 mL Milli-Q water. The three solutions were mixed in a 27:1:2
ratio to create a working solution, which was stored in dark conditions. For each test, 200 µL of the water
sample was mixed with 300 µL of the working solution in a 1-cm Micro Quartz Cuvette, shaken in the
dark for 30 seconds, and the absorbance at 350 nm was recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The
concentration of H2O2 in the 30% H2O2 solution was titrated as 9.72 M using a standard KMnO4 solution.
The calibration curve was established by diluting the 30% H2O2 solution to different concentrations (1, 5,
10, 50, 100µM). MO degradation was measured based on the absorbance at 465 nm using UV-Vis
spectrophotometry. The calibration curve was established by MO solutions of known concentrations (1,
2, 3.2, 5, 7,10 mg/L).
2.5. DFT description
All spin polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the VASP
package using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method (Kresse and Furthmüller 1996, Kresse and
Hafner 1993). Total energies were calculated using a plane wave energy cut-off of 500 eV, with the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional (Perdew et al. 1996). Total energies
were computed using convergence thresholds of 10-5 eV for self-consistent field cycles, and a force
threshold of 0.02 eV/Å. The force was minimized using the conjugate-gradient method. Dispersion
correction was applied using the Grimme’s D3 approach (Grimme et al. 2010). Gas phase species are
optimized in a cubic unit cell size of 20×20×20 Å in vacuum and the Brillouin zone was sampled using a
1×1×1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid density (Monkhorst and Pack 1976).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Methyl Orange degradation in a microfluidic sonoreactor
First, we investigated the influence of operation parameters to the performance of the microfluidic
sonoreactor in MO degradation. We varied the total flow rate (of liquid and gas), gas-to-liquid flow ratio

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

and the applied power. In each case, only the parameter under investigation was allowed to change while
other parameters were fixed. Figure 3 presents the experimental results.
In Figure 3a, we observed the optimized total flow rate of 120 μL/min. The higher the flow rate, the
shorter the MO solution was exposed to ultrasound, resulting in the reduction of MO degradation
efficiency. On the other hand, the lower the flow rate resulted in bubble coalescence when microbubbles
travelled through the microchannel, reducing the cavitation magnitude and consequently decreased the
MO degradation efficiency. Therefore, an optimum value exists for the total flow rate to achieve the
highest MO degradation yield.

Figure 3. Influence of (a) total flow rate; (b) gas-to-liquid flow ratio and (c) applied power to the
ultrasound-assisted MO degradation efficiency.
In Figure 3b, the optimized gas-to-liquid flow ratio of 1:3 resulted in the best performance of
ultrasound-assisted MO degradation. The lower this gas-to-liquid flow ratio, the less microbubbles were
generated, and the lower was the MO degradation efficiency. The higher the gas-to-liquid flow ratio, the
larger bubbles were formed. Since the cavitation were detected to be occurred at the interface of
gas/liquid, the interfacial area between liquid and gas varied inversely with the size of the bubbles.
Therefore, large bubbles also resulted in a lower MO degradation efficiency. Finally, the influence of
applied power to MO degradation efficiency is shown in Figure 3c. Low power (less than 13W) was not
enough to induce strong cavitation that is essential for MO degradation. When the applied power was

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

stronger than 13W, the supplied power was lost to thermal energy, as was presented in a review by Trinh
et al. Therefore, it explained the best-chosen power of 13W.
3.2. Sonochemical efficiency.
One grand challenge with ultrasound assisted degradation of organic pollutant in wastewater is the
low energy efficiency of conventional sonochemical processes. Usually, the sonoreactor need extremely
strong ultrasound power to generate a density of reactive oxygen species (ROS) high enough for the
degradation. We showed that the microfluidic sonoreactors developed in this study have much better
energy efficiency than almost other research in literature.

Figure 4. The rate of H2O2 formation (μM/min) achieved in the flow-focusing and T-junction
microfluidic sonoreactors and are benchmarked with data in literature. Inserted images are the gas-liquid
mixing and generation of microbubbles in the flow-focusing and T-junction microfluidic sonoreactors.
The energy efficiency is usually expressed in the capability to generate the OH radical, which could
be detected via the formation rate of H2O2 by KI dosimetry method. The results presented in Figure 4

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

showed that the H2O2 formation rate in the flow-focusing sonoreactor was much higher than those
reported in current literature. Interestingly, the T-junction sonoreactor, reported by Tadiono et al. only
produced H2O2 with one-third rate slower than the flow-focusing sonoreactor. These data clearly
demonstrated the great potential of carry out the degradation of organic pollutant in wastewater in the
appropriately designed microfluidic sonoreactor.
3.3. Role of surfactant to the ultrasound-assisted MO degradation

Figure 5. The influence of surfactant dosage to the MO degrdation efficiency. Inserted images are the
formation of microbubbles in the flow-focusing microfluidic sonoreactor with and without the
introduction of surfactant (Tween 20). Dash line represents the MO degradation efficiency without the
presence of surfactant.
The role of surfactant to the sonochemical reactions is complicated. Two opposite roles of surfactant
to the cavitation could be observed. The presence of surfactant induced the formation of smaller

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

microbubbles, forming high density of microbubbles (Figure 5). On the other hand, the surfactant also
stabilized the microbubbles and made the cavitation more difficult. Therefore, there exits an optimum
dosage of surfactant that gave the best MO degradation efficiency. According to Fig. 5, we obtained the
best dosage of Tween 20 of 0.02%. At this dosage, the MO degradation efficiency is 38.1%, better than
the value of 35.6% obtained without the presence of surfactant. It should be mentioned that the critical
micelle concentration of Tween 20 is 0.06–0.07% in water at room temperature. The higher dosage than
this range therefore does not have any positive effect to the formation of microbubbles, as is reflected by
the low efficiency of 0.1% Tween 20 in Fig. 5.
3.4. DFT mechanism

Figure 6. The activation of MO without and under ultrasound conditions

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0dxz6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-4691 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to explain the role of ROS in
activating MO. The key step for the degradation of MO is widely proposed to be the scission or the N=N
bond, followed by the subsequent ring opening to smaller fragments (Lee et al. 2016, Lughmani et al.
2022, Sun et al. 2020, Xie et al. 2016). Without the ultrasound conditions, the DFT results show that the
energy of the N=N bond in the MO molecule is ~420 kJ/mol, and therefore its cleavage is challenging.
Under ultrasound conditions, the generation of OH species from the cavitation could facilitate an
alternative pathway for the N=N bond dissociation. Indeed, we computed that the generated OH species
could oxidize the N atoms on MO to the diazenediol derivative (also called as azanone dimer derivative
or hyponitrous derivative), Figure 6. Once the diazenediol derivative was formed, the bond energy of ROHN-NOH-R is significantly reduced to ~136 kJ/mol. It therefore explains the ability of MO to be
degraded under ultrasound irradiation and again emphasize the need to design the microfluidic
sonoreactor to optimise the sonochemical yield of producing highly active OH species.
4. Conclusion
This study demonstrates that combining microbubble technology with microfluidic reactors
significantly enhances ultrasound-driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for wastewater treatment.
Using a flow-focusing sonoreactor, we achieved a high H2O2 generation rate of 0.54 μM/s and an
exceptional 35% degradation efficiency for methyl orange in just 2.9 seconds. These outstanding results
obtained in this study significantly surpass previous reports in a microfluidic system and those using
additional catalysts (Table S1), highlighting the effectiveness of microbubbles and microfluidics in
ultrasound AOP method. This study also illustrates a “proof-of-concept” for a novel and efficient approach
to facilitate the selective oxidation of renewable resources to high-value specialty chemicals using the
integration of microfluidics and sonochemistry.
