Abstract
Organic acids play an important role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the
formation of aerosol particles. They are often detected with hydronium, ammonium,
or nitrate chemical ionization sources, which are generally soft ionization sources but
may cause fragmentation. Here we explore the reactivity of adipic acid, an analogue
to the α-pinene oxidation product pinic acid, upon complexation with ammonium.
Mass spectra and mass-selective vibrational spectra show that even mild activation,
consistent with normal operation of an electrospray ionization source, yields (adipic
acid)H+ and neutral ammonia. This is traced to a specific structural motif in which
both protonated carboxylic acid carbonyl groups combine to form a site that is locally
more basic than ammonia. Further mild collisional activation yields sequential loss of
two water molecules, the known behavior of carboxylic acids in superacids, necessitating
abstraction of at least one hydrogen from a CH group. Deuterium labeling experiments

confirm that the second step indeed involves CH hydrogen atoms. Comparison of
vibrational spectra and quantum chemical calculations allows us to assign structures
for each step, identifying several ring structures but notably not forming the minimum
energy structure upon the first loss of water. ESI of a range of linear dicarboxylic
acids shows this to be a common feature of this class of organic acids. We propose a
mechanism that explains this reactivity and discuss possible atmospheric implications
of these observations.

Introduction
Atmospheric aerosols have have a pronounced effect on both human health and Earth’s
climate. 1,2 Aerosol effects currently represent the largest source of error in climate change
models. 3
Organic compounds may accelerate growth in particle processes, but the mechanism
by which they are involved is not well understood. 4–9 Secondary organic aerosols (SOA),
aerosols formed by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) undergoing gas-to-particle transfer,
constitute a significant portion of all tropospheric aerosols. 10–12 The primary complication
stems from the role of VOCs which are thought to photooxidize or chemically oxidize in
the atmosphere to yield lower volatility products that then form SOA. Estimates suggest
that between 10,000 and 100,000 different organic compounds are found in the atmosphere,
and each VOC can undergo a number of different degradation pathways yielding different
oxidation products, which greatly complicates their inclusion in any modeling attempts. 9,12
Recently, it has been established that extremely-low volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs),
believed to be formed through consecutive internal hydrogen shift reactions that facilitate
autoxidation reactions, play a critical role in organic enhanced nucleation. 13–15
The majority of studies on the impact of VOCs in the atmosphere are focused on terpenes, in particular α-pinene, which is emitted from pine forests. 9,12 A particular ozonolysis
product of α-pinene, pinic acid, has become a prototypical NPF-relevant organic acid. 16,17

Computational results have suggested that clusters of pinic acid and sulfuric acid are highly
stabilized by hydrogen bonds, and estimates of the Gibbs free energies of formation suggest
that pinic acid’s primary role is in the growth of clusters rather than the nucleation of new
clusters. 9 However, there are few experimental benchmarks with which to compare these
results.
A photoelectron spectroscopy study probed the microsolvation of cis-pinate, another photooxidation product of α-pinene, with various solvents and demonstrated a careful balance
between solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions unique to the gas-phase. 18 This suggests that the environment plays a key role in the structures and pathways of the clusters in
the atmosphere and is unlike those found in the bulk. Other work has begun to explore the
itermolecular interactions of organic acids in small clusters. 19–21
Chemical ionization (CI) sources are common mechanisms to ionize free vapors and small
particles, and are considered to be “soft” ionization sources that impart little energy into the
analyte. Typically employing protonated ammonia or water clusters for analytes with basic
sites and nitrate for analytes with acidic sites, ion-molecule proton transfer reactions drive the
ionization process. While soft, this process may still be energetic enough to drive dissociative
chemistry, and the atmospheric pressure interface of common commercial instruments have
been shown to be mildly activating, 22 suggesting that CI mass spectra may not fully represent
the gas phase species being sampled. 23
Diprotonated carboxylic acids have been observed in the presence of superacids 24,25 and
in the gas phase. 26,27 These diprotonated species show interesting properties, for instance
enhancing the reactivity of adjacent carbocationic sites and exhibit superelectrophilic reactivity. 28,29 Rearrangement of the protonated carboxylic acid to produce H2 O and an acylium
ion is observed in both the condensed and gas phases. 24,30
In this work, we employ collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry to probe
the behavior of adipic acid, an inexpensive analogue to pinic acid. 31 We isolate protonated
adipic acid and an adipic acid-ammonia compound in a ion trap and perform up to MS4

experiments to determine the decomposition products of the cluster. We then use cryogenic
ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to determine the structure of each product, leading to a proposed mechanism
describing the decomposition pathway.

Experimental Section
Ammonium-adipic acid clusters were prepared using solutions of the following reagents:
>99.0% adipic acid from Merck Millipore, HPLC grade water from Fisher Scientific, 99.9%
deuterium oxide (D2 O) from Sigma Aldrich, HPLC grade 99.8% acetonitrile, LC/MS formic
acid in H2 O from Fisher Scientific, and 95 wt. % formic acid from Sigma Aldrich.
All collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments were conducted using a Thermo
Scientific LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer. Adipic acid clusters were generated by
electrospray ionization (ESI) of a solution of 5 mM solution of adipic acid in water with
0.1 wt.% formic acid. Ammonia was presumably sourced from the atmosphere or trace
contaminants in the solute or solvent. For CID experiments, the ammonium-adipic acid
cluster was isolated and activated with enough Normalized Collision Energy (NCE, a nonstandard unit that provides a relative energy scale) to dissociate approximately 90% of the
parent ion. For MSn experiments, this process was repeated for the specified number of
CID cycles. Clusters containing deuterium were generated by ESI of a 5 mM adipic acid in
deuterium oxide with 0.1% formic acid solution.
Cryogenic ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectra were collected using a home
built photofragmentation mass spectrometer described previously. 32,33 Ammonium-adipic
acid clusters were generated by ESI of a 2.5 mM solution of adipic acid in 20:80 water:acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. These ions were then introduced into the vacuum
system and accumulated in a room temperature octopole trap. The RF amplitude and bias
of this trap can be tuned to either promote or suppress CID. Ions are then routed from this

trap to a variable-temperature octopole ion trap capable of achieving temperatures between
3 - 310 K. Messenger tagging with N2 was achieved by storing the clusters of interest in the
ion trap held between 20 - 50 K under a pulsed helium buffer gas. Here N2 is likely sourced
from background gas in the vacuum chamber (base pressure 10−8 torr). The tagged ions
are extracted from the ion trap and orthogonally accelerated into a tandem time-of-flight
mass spectrometer consisting of both a linear and reflectron stage. As the ions of interest
cross the time focus of the linear stage, they are intersected by an infrared laser pulse from
an Nd:YAG pumped infrared OPO/OPA (LaserVision) laser system. The reflectron stage
separates fragments from undetached parent ions, which are then guided into a microchannel
plate detector. Spectra are obtained by dividing the integrated intensity of the fragment by
the sum of the integrated intensities of both the parent and the fragment. A laser power
correction is then applied.
All quantum chemistry calculations were carried out at the CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ
level of theory using the Gaussian 16 suite of programs. 34 This level of theory has been shown
previously to produce computed vibrational spectra with good agreement to experimental
data while maintaining computational efficiency that allows for higher throughput to probe
structures of up to 7 components in reasonable time. 35 Computed spectra as presented were
convolved with 5 cm−1 Gaussian functions to reproduce experimental bandwidths and are
not scaled.

Results and Discussion
Protonated clusters of ammonia and adipic acid were initially generated using the LTQ
system. It was quickly noted that protonated adipic acid and its water-loss product are
readily generated as well, as shown in Figure 1. Isolation of the protonated ammonia-adipic
acid cluster yielded a substantial fraction of protonated adipic acid, and CID of the cluster
produced a 1:1 yield of protonated adipic acid.

Under ordinary solution-phase conditions, the pKa to add an additional proton
to fully protonated adipic acid is expected
to be significantly lower than the pKa of
ammonia. The generated protonated adipic
acid suggests that, in the cluster configuration, adipic acid serves as a better base
than ammonia. We hypothesized that this is
due to a confinement effect affecting the relative acidity of the protonated site. Similar
deprotonated dicarboxylic acid anions have
been shown to form ring structures featuring
a shared proton linking the two carboxylate
moities, and we proposed a similar structure
in which an ammonium or proton is shared
between the carbonyls of the two protonated
carboxylic acid groups.
To probe the structural motifs leading to this unintuitive behavior, CIVP

a single sharp feature near 3600 cm−1 that is typical for a free OH stretch. At about 3400

cm−1 we see a doublet feature that is typical of free NH2 symmetric and antisymmetric
stretches. Between 2500 - 3200 cm−1 we see relatively broad features that previous work has
assigned to NH2 stretches for NH2 groups that are participating in a hydrogen bond. 36 These
observations are consistent with the hypothesis of a bridging ammonium. The spectra between 600 - 2500 cm−1 are more complex, and here we turn to quantum chemical predictions
to assign the rest of the features and confirm the hypothesized structure. Between 600 - 1400
cm−1 we see features consisting primarily of OH bending character. Between 1400 - 1700
cm−1 the spectral features are typically mixtures of NH4 and CH2 bending modes. Around
1800 cm−1 we see an intense feature that is likely reflective of CO stretches in the structure.
The computed spectrum reproduces well all of the observed features except the hydrogenbonded NH stretches, which are typically not well represented by harmonic potentials and
thus require more sophisticated treatments to accurately reproduce. 37–39
Turning to the protonated complex, we find that the spectrum is notably harder to
parse by inspection. The free OH feature is preserved, but a new feature near 3400 cm−1
appears, and the fingerprint region is dominated by a complex feature spanning 700 - 1600
cm−1 . This type of feature is common to systems in which a shared proton contributes
intensity to a variety of mixed modes, while the energy of the center of this broad feature
is indicative of the degree to which the proton is shared between the two oxygen atoms. 40
We attribute the 3400 cm−1 feature to tag-induced red shifting of the OH stretch, as the
degree of the shift is comparable to previously observed N2 -bound OH stretches. 35,41–43 The
broad, lower energy feature is qualitatively consistent with the computed spectrum at the
bottom of Figure 1C, though the harmonic spectrum predictably does not reproduce the
complexity of the experimental spectrum (Figure S1). We ascribe this feature to a series of
anharmonic bands sharing intensity with a strongly-shared proton stretch centered around
1200 cm−1 . Such spectral congestion is commonly observed when a strongly absorbing
transition is red shifted into resonance with nominally spectroscopically-dark transitions to
which it is strongly coupled. 44,45 The spectrum and degree of shift is consistent with observed

shared protons between two deprotonated carboxylic acids in dodecanedioic acid. 46
Taken together, these spectra confirm
the possibility that the fully protonated acid
can still behave as a base, particularly when
confined in a geometry that exposes a binding site bridging the two carboxylic acid carbonyls. This observation adds to the growing library of unintuitive acid base interactions for confined systems confirmed spectroscopically. 47–49
We found that marginally increasing the
“harshness” of the ion source by increasing
the pressure in the first vacuum region and
creating larger potential differences between
adjacent electrodes led to the production of
additional fragments in conditions that we
would not expect fragmentation for typical
ESI-sourced molecular ions. We investigated

the formation of these fragments using a series of CID experiments. AA(NH4+ ) or AAH+ was isolated in the LTQ ion trap and fragmented. The same results were found regardless of the species initially isolated, but most
experiments discussed here isolated the protonated species initially due to its higher abundance. The primary fragment was then isolated, and fragmented in the same manner until
a fragment was created that required significantly higher NCE to dissociate. The resulting
mass spectra are shown in Figure 2A. We found dissociation to occur at relatively low NCE
more typical of breaking hydrogen bonds (a setting of 10-20 in our instrument). Dissociation
proceeds primarily by sequential loss of two water molecules. This observation is unexpected,

as there are only three hydrogen atoms bound to oxygen. Therefore, at least one of the water
fragments must contain a hydrogen that originated on the CH backbone. Fragmentation of
the second water-loss product leads primarily to loss of CO, terminating the dissociation
mechanism for low-NCE excitation. A minor pathway is observed consisting of loss of CO
after the loss of only one water, and the fragment produced by CO loss subsequently loses
water. Thus, both pathways ultimately converge after the loss of two water molecules and
one CO group.
To determine which fragmentation step
involves hydrogen originating from a CH2
group, the same series of CID experiments
was conducted on triply-deuterated protonated adipic acid molecules in which the
labile oxygen-bound hydrogens were exchanged with deteurium as presented in Figure S2. The first step observed is the loss of
D2 O, while the second water lost is found
to be either HOD or H2 O indicating that
one or two deuterium atoms can remain on
the backbone and multiple CH hydrogendeuterium exchanges may occur.
We generated each of these fragments
in our homebuilt photofragmentation mass
spectrometer by increasing the pressure and
the extraction voltage of the room temperature accumulation octopole. Each fragment Figure 3:

as shown in Figure 2B. While the spectra of AA(NH4+ ) and AAH+ are largely similar,
suggesting similar overall structure, the three fragments show substantial spectral changes,
suggest significant structural rearrangements occur during the dissociation process.
We expect that several regions of the spectrum should be indicative of the structural
motifs in each cluster. For instance, the region of 3550 - 3700 cm−1 is highly diagnostic for
free OH groups. The region between 1500 - 2500 cm−1 typically includes CO stretches that
are expected to be sensitive to the precise molecular structure of each cluster.
The CIVP spectrum of AAH+ −H2 O is
shown in Figure 3 with three potential lowenergy structures and their associated computed harmonic vibrational spectra.

The

spectrum presents as a relatively simple trio
of intense features, one in the OH stretching region and two in the fingerprint region. The spectrum is not consistent with
the predicted lowest energy structure (A),
which features three strong OH stretches
and is lacking the feature near 2100 cm−1 .
This suggests that, on the 100 ms timescale
of the experiment, AAH+ −H2 O is kinetically trapped. We present two other potential structures that, while higher in energy,
both represent unique conformations with

and predicted vibrational spectra. The open
structure (C) is both higher in energy than the closed structure, and predicts intense shared
proton transitions around 2330 and 2660 cm−1 that are not observed experimentally. Overall,

the seven-membered ring (B) is the most consistent match to the experimentally observed
spectrum. We conclude that structure B is the most likely structure and hypothesize that
the minimum-energy structure is not likely to be found due to the presence of a tight transition state for five-membered ring closing, requiring coordinated motions of the hydrocarbon
backbone.
The spectrum of AAH+ −2 H2 O is presented in Figure (4) along with the two
lowest energy computed structures.

The

spectrum presents four major bands, an
OH stretch around 3400 cm−1 , a likely CH
stretch around 3000 cm−1 , a stretch near
2300 cm−1 in a range that would most
likely correspond to CO motion, and a peak
near 1500 cm−1 that is not straightforwardly
identified. The computed harmonic vibrational spectrum of the lowest energy structure (A) found is in relatively good agreement with three of these peaks, capturing
the major OH, CO, and COH stretches.
However, it does not capture the intensity
of the CH stretch around 3000 cm−1 . On Figure 5: A comparison of the infrared CIVP specthe other hand, a second isomer (B) which
is higher in energy, does capture the CH and

CO stretches well. Given the prominent OH stretch and anomalously intense CH stretching
feature, we suggest that we are observing an isomeric mixture of these two structures. Additional isomers similar to A were computed, in which the double bond was permuted around
the ring, but none produced qualitatively different spectra and were significantly higher in

energy (Figure S3).
The spectrum of AAH+ −H2 O−CO is presented in Figure 5 alongside the two lowest
energy computed structures. The experimental spectrum presents two primary features, an
OH stretch consistent with that of the fragment of the first water loss, and an intense peak
in the region previously ascribed to CO stretching. The computed harmonic vibrational
spectrum of the lowest energy structure (A), a six-membered ring, is in good agreement
with the observed CIVP spectrum, capturing both the prominent OH stretch and the CO
stretches. Recalling that this fragment is produced from the putative seven-membered ring
discussed above, rather than the five-membered ring resulting from the second loss of water,
this structure seems mechanistically plausible. In fact, the spectra are nearly identical, lacking only the higher energy CO stretching band that is presumably lost as neutral CO upon
dissociation. The second lowest energy structure (B) is a five-membered ring significantly
higher in energy, and predicts two unique OH stretches that are not observed experimentally.
Thus, we assign this spectrum purely to isomer A.

One hypothesis for the formation of the observed species is depicted in Scheme 1 and features intramolecular nucleophilic attack of a protonated adipic acid rotamer (AAH+ rotamer)
via 7-exo-trig cyclization, followed by intramolecular dehydration of orthoester A to form
protonated cyclic anhydride B. The initial intramolecular cyclization, which involves attack
on an electrophilic carbonyl group, may be kinetically favored over a potential, competing
intramolecular deprotonation and aldol-like reaction that would yield the unobserved, but
thermodynamically more favored β-ketoacid C (Scheme 1, bottom). The observed transformation of protonated cyclic anhydride B to the final cyclopentanone product D could
arise from ring-opening to yield acyl cation E. The positive charge on the carbonyl carbon
in E would increase the acidity of the vicinal proton, enabling intramolecular deprotonation
to form ketene F. 50 Subsequent dehydration and nucleophilic attack on the resultant acyl
cation would afford cyclopentanone E. This mechanism is consistent with the experimental
isotope scrambling observations, as the initial water loss in triply deuterated adipic acid
involves only deuterons on labile oxygens to yield D2 O, but the second water loss involves
deprotonation of the carbon backbone, and therefore yields HOD or H2 O.
Finally, we sought to determine if this
reactivity was unique to adipic acid or common to dicarboxylic acids. Figure 6 presents
the ESI mass spectra of a series of linear
dicarboxylic acids containing 1-5 methylene
groups (C3-C7, respectively, in Figure 6) under typical conditions without additional activation. We find that each does indeed lose Figure 6: ESI MS of a mixture of linear dicarboxylic

This presumably reflects a reduction of steric hindrance for the longer chains. As we show
in the Supplementary Information, these species also undergo similar sequential loss of two

water molecules and loss of CO upon CID, consistent with our observations of protonation
adipic acid.
Taking these results into account, we are able to identify several potentially interesting
lessons from the dissociation of adipic acid. First, the loss of ammonia creating protonated
adipic acid suggests that dramatic changes in basicity can be caused by specific conformational motifs potentially found in atmospherically-relevant clusters as compared to bulk
solution or larger particles. It is possible that this confinement-induced basicity effect could
be common in both small clusters and, potentially, rough surfaces of small particles. Second,
acid-induced reactivity may yield unexpected products in particularly acidic environments.
Aerosols have been found to be protonated at levels consistent with pH values near zero, 51,52
and specific sites may be expected to be even more acidic. Third, the proposed ring-closing
reaction we observe could simply be an artifact of the unimolecular nature of this obseservation. This implies that dimer-forming reactions may occur in clusters of multiple organic
acids or particle surfaces. This would significantly reduce the vapor pressure of acid molecules
in those clusters or particles, leading to enhanced stability and growth rates. Finally, we
note that the readily-achieved water loss from the cluster also facilitates an aging-related
reduction in the O:C ratio of the cluster. Taken together, these observations speak to the
complexity of the behavior of acidic clusters in the atmosphere.

Conclusion
In this work, we investigated the evolution of clusters of ammonium and adipic acid under
mildly activating thermodynamic conditions that might be present in typical CIMS instruments. In the cluster geometry, we have observed adipic acid serving as a stronger base than
ammonia in the gas phase. This is consistent with similar suggestions of pinic acid acting as
a base in pinic acid - sulfuric acid clusters 9 and suggests that the specifics of the gas phase
can complicate traditional views on relative basicity from solution-based perspectives. This

dramatic change is basicity is likely driven by the conformation of the ammonium-adipic
acid complex, and this type of conformational change in basicity could be present in many
small clusters or potential particle surfaces. 47,48
We demonstrate that the breakdown of adipic acid in the presence of an extra proton
occurs via a complex set of internal hydrogen shifts, suggesting a possible new route for the
formation of ELVOCs in the atmosphere and further supporting the notion that hydrogen
shifts are crucial in understanding the role of organic compounds in the atmosphere. This
acid-induced reactivity may be present in other particularly acidic clusters or on particle
surfaces.
Taken together, these results show that clusters make up a laboratory for accessing potentially unique organic chemistry that involves unusual acid-base interactions and confinement
effects that may have significant atmospheric ramifications justifying further investigation.
