Abstract: The development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for heavy metals removal from

12

water faces ongoing challenge related to balancing performance with cost-effective synthesis. In

13

this work, we report the first application of Calgary Framework 20 (CALF-20), a zinc-based

14

MOF synthesized via a low-cost method, for the efficient adsorption of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions

15

from aqueous solutions. Synthesized at room temperature using commercially available,

16

inexpensive reagents and green solvents, CALF-20 represents a highly economical alternative to

17

many conventional MOFs. It exhibited excellent adsorption efficiency, achieving uptake

capacities of 250 mg/g for Cu(II) and 833 mg/g for Pb(II) at the optimum pH of 5.3,

19

outperforming many MOFs reported to date. Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-

20

order model, while equilibrium data aligned well with the Langmuir isotherm. CALF-20 was

21

demonstrated strong performance under competitive ion conditions, removing over 99% of

22

Cu(II) and 80% of Pb(II). The material’s high adsorption capacity, low synthesis cost, chemical

23

robustness, and reusability across multiple cycles underscore its potential for industrial scale

water treatment and environmental remediation.

1. INTRODUCTION

27

The impact of heavy metals like copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) pollution of water sources has far

28

reaching environmental and health consequences because of their non-biodegradability, high

29

toxic, and bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems.1-2 Expose and excessive intake of these metals

30

can lead to several types of metabolic and physiological disorders in humans, animals, and

31

plants.2-3 The source of these metals can be attributed to different industries, mineral processing,

32

metal plating and battery manufacturing among others4, making the efficient removal strategies

33

of these metal ions a critical global challenge.

34

Several treatment methods have been used to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous media,

35

including evaporation, electrodeposition, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, and ion

36

exchange, however, they are often suffering from high operational costs, incomplete ion removal,

37

ineffective, and harmful to the environment.5-6 Adsorption-based technologies are widely

38

recognized and considered as a popular choice alternative to aforementioned methods for their

39

cost-effectiveness, flexibility in design, operational simplicity, reversibility, and high removal

40

efficiency.7 The efficiency of adsorption method is largely constrained by the ability to design

41

adsorbents with the necessary physical and chemical functionalities tailored for the target

42

contaminant. Porous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)8-9 have been shown to

43

be very effective adsorbents10-11 for heavy metal ions because of their high surface area, tunable

44

pore size, and numerous number of active sites. MOFs are advanced inorganic-organic hybrid

45

materials12 that allow for the systematic buildup of metal clusters and organic linkers into

46

topologically well-defined porous architectures. Reticular chemistry13-17 has been developed as a

47

discipline over the last decade and topology diagrams and synthetic methodologies are now

48

available to create a vast number of MOFs with potential applications. Recent developments

49

have led to the synthesis of numerous MOFs with high selectivity and affinity towards the target

50

pollutants, Cu(II) and/or Pb(II), based on variation in surface area, pore size, and chemistry for

51

the environmental remediation.10, 18 MOF-5, a cubic MOF compound synthesized from zinc and

52

1,4-terephthalic acid, showed a maximum uptake of 289.9 mg/g on Cu(II) and 517.6 mg/g on

53

Pb(II) at a pH of 5.2.19 Upon changing the zinc to copper, Rahimi and Mohaghegh found that the

54

copper-terephthalate MOF, Cu(tpa)(dmf), only showed an uptake of Cu(II) and Pb(II) with 71.9

55

mg/g and 35.1 mg/g at a pH of 7, respectively.20 Shooto et al. reported a Cadmium-based MOF,

56

which is non-porous to N2, exhibiting a 183.4 mg/g uptake of Cu(II) and 171.4 mg/g removal of

57

Pb(II) from aqueous solutions without cadmium ion leaching.21 Ghaedi et al. also used a

58

Cadmium-based MOF, MOF-2(Cd), for the removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) in aqueous solutions.

59

They found that the MOF-2(Cd) was not only chemical and thermal stable but also had a

60

maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 434.8 and 769.2 mg/g, respectively, towards Cu(II)

61

and Pb(II) at a pH 6 aqueous solution.22 Other MOF materials, such as ZIF-823, UiO-6624-26, Cd-

62

MOF-7427, etc., were also investigated for their potential use in Cu(II) and/or Pb(II) ions

63

removal. Despite extensive research on MOFs for wastewater treatment, many exhibit significant

64

limitations, including low sensitivity for target ions, insufficient adsorption capacity, and

65

vulnerability to humidity and acidity due to the hydrolysis of metal ligand bonds.28 Additionally,

66

their synthesis methods are often not optimized for cost-effective large-scale heavy metal ion

67

removal, making practical application challenging.29 Therefore, developing selective adsorbent

68

with high adsorption capacity, rapid kinetics, and cost-effective is crucial for advancing

69

wastewater treatment technologies.

70

Zinc-based Calgary Framework 20 (CALF-20) is a MOF that has recently demonstrated for

71

selective separations due to the high chemical robustness and precise structural design30. Notable

72

is that while many other MOFs are unstable in humid conditions, and are thus not suitable for use

73

in steam or wet acid gases environments, CALF-20 is stable and performs well in such

74

conditions, which makes it suitable for real life use.30-31 The structure of this zinc-based MOF

75

reveals a 3D nanoscale lattice with high pore interconnection, a feature that would suggest

76

suitability for adsorption of heavy metal ions. Lin et al.30 documented that a high product yields

77

of up to 90% and an exceptional space-time yield of 550 kg/m3 day can be achieved by using

78

methanol and water as solvents, as well as low cost, commercially available starting materials. In

79

2023, BASF in collaboration with Canadian company Svante had successfully scaled up CALF-

80

20 from lab-scale to industrial scale with an estimation of more than 200 tons per year32 by using

81

a simple low-temperature process in accordance with green chemistry principles. With the

82

hundred-ton scale production, the price of CALF-20 is estimated to be $20-30 per kg32-33.

83

Here, for the first time, we report the heavy metal adsorption performance of CALF-20 in both

84

batch and continuous flow systems, focusing on its applicability for Cu(II) and Pb(II) removal

85

(Scheme 1). Coupled aqueous coordination chemistry and supramolecular assembly, a simple,

86

green, and scalable synthesis approach of CALF-20 at ambient temperature and pressure was

87

achieved. The effective of pH, initial concentration, contact time, and coexisting cations on the

88

adsorption process were evaluated. As-synthesized CALF-20 demonstrated significant Cu(II) and

89

Pb(II) capture capabilities compared to its MOF analogues, due to its microporous structure,

90

stable framework, and high surface area. The adsorption isotherms, kinetics, reusability, and

91

adsorption mechanism were analyzed and investigated. With this comprehensive evaluation of

92

CALF-20's feasibility in Cu(II) and Pb(II) removal, this work aims to demonstrate its potential

93

for wastewater remediation applications.

without further purification.

105

2.2 Synthesis procedures

106

The synthesis of CALF-20 powder was carried out based on the method reported in the literature

107

with modification.34 In a 150 mL water/methanol solution (120/30, v/v), 5.50g, 0.025 mol of

108

109

mol of sodium oxalate was then added to previous solution to form a suspension and stirred for

110

another 10 minutes. 3.45 g, 0.05 mol of 1H-1,2,4-triazole was then added to the suspension, and

111

the mixture was stirred for 60 minutes to generate CALF-20 particles. Once done, the precipitate

112

was isolated via centrifugation, washed several times with RO water, and dried at 130°C under

113

vacuum overnight for further use. An 83% yield based on the mass of Zn source was achieved.

114

2.3 Characterizations

115

The structure of CALF-20 was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance

116

(ECO), Bruker AXS, Germany) equipped with a Copper-source X-ray (1.5406 Å) within a 2θ

117

angle of 5 to 45°. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data were collected in the

118

wavenumbers ranging from 4000 to 400 cm−1 on a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer

119

(Agilent Cary 630, Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). The concentration of heavy metallic ions

120

was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES,

121

iCAP 7200, Thermo Scientific, USA). Gas sorption analyses were conducted via a

122

Micromeriticis ASAP 2460 or a TriStar II Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer (Micromeritics

123

Instrument Corporation, USA). The structural morphology and elemental content distribution

124

were probed on a FEI XL30 scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) instrument (Philips,

125

USA). The zeta potential measurements of CALF-20 were carried out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS

126

(Malvern Panalytical, UK). X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was carried out using an

127

ESCALAB QXi (Thermo Scientific, USA) and the analysis was conducted on a K-Alpha plus X-

128

ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al-Kα as the excitation source.

130

The adsorption experiments were carried out based on single-factor effects. The effect of

131

concentration ([Cu2+]=1-400 mg/L, [Pb2+]=1-600 mg/L), time (0 to 480 min), pH (3 to 9), and

132

removal efficiency on the adsorption of Cu(II) and Pb(II) were studied in a batch method.

133

Briefly, 2.5 mg of the CALF-20 adsorbent was dispersed to 10 mL of aqueous solutions, which

134

were prepared by dissolving copper(II) nitrate and lead(II) nitrate in reverse osmosis (RO) water

135

at room temperature. The pH values were adjusted with diluted HCl and NaOH solutions, the

136

mixture was shaken at 20 °C for 360 min. After extraction, the metal ion concentrations were

137

monitored by ICP-OES. The adsorption capacity (qt, mg/g) and removal efficiency (R%) were

138

calculated using Equation (1) and Equation (2), respectively.

142

respectively, V (L) refers to the volume of the solution, and W (g) refers to the mass of the

143

adsorbent.

144

Desorption studies were conducted to examine the repeated regeneration of CALF-20. In these

145

experiments, the adsorbed CALF-20 was washed with a 0.3 M thiourea solution containing 0.001

146

M HCl after adsorbing Cu(II) and Pb(II). Specifically, 160 mg of CALF-20 was dispersed in 40

147

mL of Cu(II) solution (~400 mg/L, pH 5.3) and shaken at 20°C for 4 hours. Following

148

centrifugation, the used CALF-20 was added to 15 mL of thiourea solution and shaking was

149

done for another 60 minutes. After separating the solid from the liquid, another portion of 15 mL

150

of thiourea solution was added to the solid for an additional 60 minutes. Once this process was

151

complete, the solid was separated using a centrifuge, and the regenerated CALF-20 was washed

152

several times with RO water until it reached a neutral pH. The regenerated CALF-20 was then

153

vacuum-dried and reintroduced into a fresh Cu(II) or Pb(II) solution and shaken for 4 hours to

154

assess its adsorption capacity. The regeneration efficiency was calculated based on the amount of

155

metal ions adsorbed and desorbed using ICP-OES. These adsorption-desorption cycles were

156

repeated five times.

157

2.5 Multi-component batch adsorption experiments.

158

Multi-component batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of

159

CALF-20 in removing Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions simultaneously. A solution containing varying

160

concentrations (0.07-5.30 ppm) of multiple heavy metal ions (Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), Cr(III), and

161

Fe(III)) was prepared to simulate the composition of a coal mine waste water35. Different dosage

162

of CALF-20 sample (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/L) was added to a beaker containing 40 ml of

163

mixed ion solution. The mixture was maintained at room temperature for 4 hours with stirring

164

before filtering through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. The filtrates were subsequently analyzed using

165

ICP-OES to determine the concentration of residual metal content.

166

2.6 Fixed-bed dynamic breakthrough experiment

167

CALF-20 sample (approximately 5.0 g) was packed into a column with an inner diameter of

168

approximately 20 mm and a packed length of about 3 cm. An aqueous solution containing both

169

heavy metal ions (Cu(II) and Pb(II)) at a concentrations of about 5 ppm passed through the

170

column at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min at room temperature. The filtrates were subsequently

171

analyzed using ICP-OES to determine the concentration of the residual metal content.

3.1 Characterization

174

The structure of CALF-20 was reported and discussed in the paper published in 2021 by the

175

George Shimizu group30 and frameworks built from Zn(II), triazolate (trz) and oxalate (ox) ions

176

were published and discussed earlier 36-38. CALF-20 is composed of layers of 1,2,4-triazole-

177

bridged zinc(II) ions pillared by oxalate ions to form a three-dimensional lattice and three-

178

dimentional pore structure, as illustrated in Figure 1a-c. The synthesized CALF-20 was

179

confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the range of 2θ = 5°–45° with the black simulated

180

pattern reported in literature39, as shown in Figure 1d. The main characteristic peaks for the as-

181

synthesized CALF-20 are consistent with the simulated CALF-20 pattern indicating a successful

182

synthesis. The CALF-20 powders acquired prior to, and post adsorption process were examined

183

to study the change in crystalline features of the adsorbent. The existence of sharp and intense

184

XRD peaks in these samples indicates a high degree of crystallinity. The major peaks in the

185

PXRD of CALF-20 are retained after metal sorption and desorption.

193

The acquired N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77K for CALF-20, Cu@CALF-20, and

194

Pb@CALF-20 are presented in Figure S1. It can be observed that at low relative pressures (P/P0),

195

there is a rapid increase in N2 adsorption, followed by a plateau-like behavior. The isotherm

196

bends towards the P/P0 axis and then exhibits a plateau, with the adsorption reaching a saturation

197

point. These characteristics typify a Type I isotherm distribution based on the IUPAC

198

(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) classification.40 The pronounced increase

199

observed at low pressures is predominantly due to enhanced interaction between the adsorbent

200

and adsorbate within the micropores, causing these pores to fill at remarkably low pressures. The

201

curve rises again when approaching saturation pressure (P/P0 > 0.8), mainly due to condensation

202

of the adsorbate. These isotherms also indicate that the primary pores of CALF-20, Cu@CALF-

203

20 and Pb@CALF-20 are mainly micropores. CALF-20 demonstrated a BET surface area of 500

204

m²/g (Table S1), consistent with previously reported literature values30, confirming the successful

205

synthesis of the material. Notably, this surface area is significantly higher compared to

206

Cu@CALF-20 (328 m²/g) and Pb@CALF-20 (200 m²/g).

207

The porosity of CALF-20 was also evaluated by CO2 isotherm at 273 K since CALF-20 is

208

renowned for precise pore design on CO2 capture. Isotherms were collected for CALF-20,

209

Cu@CALF-20, and Pb@CALF-20, and are depicted in Figure 1b. All three samples give Type I

210

isotherm according to IUPAC classification40 indicating the exist of pore size distributions over a

211

broader range including wider micropores and possibly narrow mesopores (less than 2.5 nm),

212

which agrees with the N2 isotherm results. At 120 kPa, the CO2 capacities are 4.82, 3.03, and

213

2.45 mmol/g for CALF-20, Cu@CALF-20, and Pb@CALF-20, respectively. The isotherms of

214

CALF-20 post Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption reach their ‘knee’ earlier than CALF-20 indicating

215

they have less available surface area. All three samples adsorb a considerable amount of CO2 in
12

216

the low-pressure region, however, there is a significant difference between their total CO2

217

uptakes. When metal ions were loaded, a 40%-50% uptake capacity decrease was observed.

218

To better probe the change of the characteristics of CALF-20 post metal ion adsorption, the pore

219

size distribution of all three samples were also calculated using a NLDFT method41 on their

220

273K CO2 isotherm data. As inserted picture shown in Figure 1e, CALF-20 has micropores with

221

a diameter of 3.6, 5.0, 6.0, 6.8, and 8.0 Å. When metal ions were introduced, these narrowest

222

pores were likely occupied by metal ions as indicated by the decreased incremental pore volume

223

for all pore size ranges.

224

The CALF-20 sample was characterized by SEM to investigate the surface morphology (Figure

225

S2). The crystals of the original CALF-20 sample are irregular polyhedrons with a smooth

226

surface and have an average size of 300-400 nm width and 400-500 nm length.

227

The cost for manufacturing of CALF-20 was calculated using the method reported by Ashley

228

Sutton42 based on the raw materials used. Although different starting materials employed, a same

229

USD $29 per kg manufacture cost was achieved and the break down calculation can be found in

230

Table S2.

231

3.2 Batch adsorption studies

232

The pH of the solution has an impact on the surface charge density and adsorption capacity of the

233

adsorbent during the actual adsorption process. To investigate the effect of pH on the adsorption

234

efficiency of Cu(II) and Pb(II) by CALF-20, we analyzed the zeta potential of CALF-20 across

235

different pH values (Figure S3). As shown in Figure S3, CALF-20 carried positive charges at pH

236

2-7. Figure S4 summarized the adsorption capacity of CALF-20 on Cu(II) and Pb(II) at different

13

237

pH environments and the default pH of the Cu(II) and Pb(II) solution was 5.3. The maximum

238

adsorption capacity for Cu(II) and Pb(II) at 100 ppm were 350 mg/g at pH 4.5 and 504 mg/g at

239

pH 5.3, respectively. At low pH values (<4), metal ions were competed with large amount of

240

H3O+ for the active sites on the adsorbent surface.43 When pH was higher than 4.5 for Cu(II) and

241

5.3 for Pb(II), the adsorption capacity of CALF-20 for both ions decreased, due to the lesser

242

amount of reactive groups on the adsorbent surface. On the other hand, for a neutral or basic

243

environment, metal hydroxide precipitates out for both ions44, lowering the adsorption capacity.

244

Given so, pH 5.3 was used for further adsorption studies of CALF-20 on Cu(II) and Pb(II).

245

The effect of contact time on the adsorption properties of CALF-20 for Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions

was investigated in a solution with a pH of 5.3 at 20°C. As shown in Figure 2a, the adsorption of

247

both Cu(II) and Pb(II) by CALF-20 is rapid during the first 20 minutes. This initial fast

248

adsorption is primarily due to the abundance of accessible active sites on the surface of CALF-20

249

and the significant concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the solid-liquid

250

interface, which provides a strong driving force for adsorption. After 20 minutes, a large number

251

of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions occupy the adsorption sites on the surface and within the structural

252

voids of CALF-20, slowing the adsorption rate. At this stage, new metal ions must diffuse

253

through the pore channels of CALF-20 to access the less accessible internal adsorption sites,

254

resulting in a slower adsorption rate until equilibrium is reached. For Cu(II), adsorption

255

equilibrium is achieved at around 15 minutes, with an adsorption capacity of 225 mg/g reached.

256

The uptake of Pb(II), on the other hand, shows a slower uptake rate and equilibrium is reached

257

only at about 240 minutes.

experiment, 10 mg of CALF-20 was exposed to a Cu(II) and Pb(II) solution at pH 5.3.

261

The kinetic properties of CALF-20 adsorption of both Cu(II) and Pb(II) were investigated by

262

pseudo-first-order (PFO) model,45 pseudo-second-order (PSO) model,46 Elovich model,47 and

263

Weber-Morris intra-particle diffusion48 kinetic model, as listed in Table S4. Based on the data

264

presented in Table 1 and the regression analysis in Figure 2b, Figure S5, and Figure S8, the

265

correlation coefficients (R²) and calculated qe values indicate that the pseudo-second-order (PSO)

266

kinetic model provides the most accurate fit of the adsorption kinetics of Cu(II) and Pb(II) onto

267

CALF-20, surpassing other kinetic models.

To further identify the rate-controlling steps during the adsorption mechanism, the Weber-

270

Morries intra-particle diffusion model was applied.49-50 As illustrated in Figure S6 and S9, the

271

Weber-Morris plot of qe vs. t1/2 reveals two distinct stages with different line slopes. Since these

272

slop lines do not pass through the origin point(C1≠0 in Table 1), the intra-particle diffusion is not

273

the only rate-controlling step in a complex mechanism and the adsorption process involves both

274

external and internal diffusion. Specifically, the first stage relates to instantaneous adsorption or

275

external surface adsorption, characterized by its high slope values (Kp1), indicating a rapid uptake

276

rate of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions at the beginning of the adsorption process. This is due to the

277

abundance of active sites on the adsorbent surface. The second stage, which represents

278

progressive adsorption or intra-particle diffusion, has lower slopes (Kp2) reflecting a reduced

279

concentration gradient of the adsorbates. This reflects a lower uptake rates given slower diffusion

280

of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions into the micropores of the adsorbent. Micropores in CALF-20 facilitates

281

effective mass transfer, minimizing the distance for copper and lead ions to migrate into the

282

adsorbent, thereby enhancing diffusion efficiency and promoting adsorption. These findings

283

suggest that intra-particle diffusion is indeed the primary rate-controlling process in the

284

adsorption mechanism.

285

To understand more about the adsorption mechanism and investigate the interaction between

286

adsorbent and adsorbate, the effect of the initial concentration of Cu(II) and Pb(II) on the

287

adsorption capacity at 20°C was studied and the adsorption isotherms were carried out. Solutions

288

with varying concentrations of Cu(II) and Pb(II) were prepared to evaluate the performance of

289

the adsorbent. The adsorption isotherm of both Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions on the CALF-20 is

290

presented in Figure 2b, with the equilibrium concentration (Ce) on the x-axis and the amount

291

adsorbed at equilibrium (qe) on the y-axis. CALF-20 has an equilibrium uptake of 250 and 788

292

mg/g for Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively, which is higher than most reported MOF adsorbents

293

(Table S5), highlighting its superior adsorption capacity.10, 35, 51

294

To better understand the effect of concentration on the nature of Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption by

295

CALF-20, we examined the adsorption isotherms using the Langmuir,52 Freundlich,53 Langmuir-

296

Freundlich,54 Temkin,55 and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) models (Figure S7 and Figure S10,

297

respectively). The corresponding isotherm equations are provided in Table S3. According to the

298

correlation data presented in Table 2, the Langmuir isotherm exhibits the highest correlation

299

coefficient (R2) values, indicating it can fit the experimental data better than other models. The

300

curve of experimental data follows a typical Langmuir isotherm, where qe increases rapidly at

301

low Ce values, indicating high adsorption efficiency. The maximum uptake capacities, qm,

302

derived from the Langmuir model are 250 mg/g for Cu(II) and 833 mg/g for Pb(II), closely

303

matching the experimental values.

304

The removal efficiency of CALF-20 for Cu(II) and Pb(II) was compared across different metal

305

ion concentration solutions. CALF-20 exhibited remarkable removal efficiency for Cu(II),

306

achieving over 90% under all conditions and exceeding 95% for solutions with Cu(II)

307

concentrations higher than 25 mg/L (Figure S11). For Pb(II), CALF-20 can remove about 90% at

308

1ppm Pb(II) solution and upon increase of concentration of Pb(II) ions in the aqueous solution,

309

the removal efficiency increased to 96% - 98%. The high efficiency is likely due to CALF-20’s

310

extensive surface area, microporous structure, and strong binding affinity for metal ions, making

311

it a promising candidate for industrial wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.

312

These findings highlight the potential of CALF-20 in effectively removing heavy metal ions

313

from contaminated water sources, with particularly high efficiency for Cu(II) and Pb(II).

3.3 Adsorption mechanism

325

To gain insight into the interaction of Cu(II) or Pb(II) with CALF-20, XPS spectra of pristine and

326

metal-ion loaded CALF-20 were acquired in the binding energy regions of the Cu 2p, Pb 4f, N

327

1s, and O 1s orbitals (Figure S12). As shown in Figure 4a, pairs of Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 doublets (at

328

953.3/933.5 and 954.8/935.3 eV) and the charge transfer shake-up satellites (at 963.4 and

329

944.2 eV) were observed on Cu@CALF-20, indicating the existence of Cu(I) and Cu(II),

330

respectively, which agrees with literature56. For Pb@CALF-20, two peaks appear at 138.2 and

331

143.1 eV, attributed to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively57, which can be associated with Pb-O

332

bonding (Figure 4b). Additionally, two weaker peaks at 136.4 eV and 141.2 eV, corresponding to

333

Pb(0)57, possibly due to free Pb(II) adsorbing onto CALF20 and being partly reduced to Pb(0).

334

Figure 4c displays the N 1s spectrum of pristine CALF-20, Cu@CALF-20 and Pb@CALF-20,

335

respectively, at 399 and 400.7 eV attributing to C-N and C=N bonds. Once metal ion is adsorbed,

336

the spectrum of N 1s shifts towards lower binding energy, which indicates an electron density

337

redistribution due to interaction between metal ion and the nitrogen atom.58 Given that Cu(II) has

338

a higher charge density compared to Pb(II), a more significant charge density redistribution and a

339

larger shift in binding energy are observed. Similar trend is also observed from Figure 4d, which

340

shows O 1s spectrum of pristine CALF-20, Cu@CALF-20 and Pb@CALF-20, respectively.

341

Typically, the adsorption sites are depleted due to oxidation, resulting in a reduced adsorption

342

capacity during subsequent reuse cycles. This represents a significant drawback for certain

343

adsorbents, however, according to our XPS data, a substantial reduction of Cu(II) or Pb(II) was

344

observed on the bidning energy of N 1s changes, possibly due to the metal-π interaction formed

345

between the metal and the triazolate groups of CALF-20. The electron density transfer from the

346

π-system of the triazolate ring to the copper ion facilitates the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and

347

helps stabilize the Cu(I) state. With no N-O peak shows up on the N 1s spectra (Figure 4c),59 it is

348

likely that the Cu(II) or Pb(II) was reducted without oxidizing the aromatic amine on the CALF-

349

20 framework and only through ligand-to-metal charge transfer36-37, 60.

353

The XPS-detected reduction of metal ions during adsorption is also reported in the literature. In

354

2020, Jeffrey Urban and co-workers56 published their work of a hydrogen-bonded organic-

355

inorganic framework, zinc imidazole salicylaldoxime (ZIOS) for trace copper ion removal from

356

water. The ZIOS was believed a better candidate than ZIF-8 and it was proved very stable in

357

water. As their XPS results indicated, the copper(I) peaks showed in both ZIOS and ZIF-8 post

358

adsorption. They believe this was caused by the change in coordination environment of Cu

359

brought the electron donating/accepting ability changed. They also found the downshift of N 1s

360

binding energy in ZIOS which is like our findings. Coincidentally, Xuwei Chen and co-workers61

361

in their work of using a TbDa-COF for efficient and rapid extract Au(III) from e-waste solution

362

also noticed the reduction of metal ions adsorbed. Their XPS spectra also indicated a reduction

363

happened to Au(III) adsorbed and Au(0) characteristic peak was clearly observed. The shift of N

364

1s binding energy was also revealed and they believe the metal ion reduction was due to the

365

electron donors supplied via TbDa-COF with electron rich N/O-containing groups in the capture

366

process.

367

The CALF-20 samples prior and post metal ion adsorption were investigated by FTIR

368

spectrometer and the FTIR spectra were plotted in Figure S13 in the range of 400-4000 cm−1.

369

The absorption peaks from CALF-20@Cu and CALF-20@Pb can be indexed to the ones on

370

CALF-20, indicating the unchanged bond and structure of the adsorbent. Elemental mapping

371

images of Cu(II) or Pb(II) loaded CALF-20 were obtained and shown in Figure S14. Cu(II) and

372

Pb(II) are found to be evenly distributed in the mapping area, along with zinc and nitrogen maps,

373

indicating that the adsorption predominantly happened on the surface.

374

3.4 Regeneration and reusability

375

To ensure cost-effectiveness and long-term feasibility in practical applications, solid sorbents are

376

evaluated of their regenerative ability. Here, five adsorption-desorption cycles were applied to

377

CALF-20 adsorbent and the desorption of the sorbent was conducted using an acidic thiourea

378

solution. As shown in Figure 5, the adsorption capacity of CALF-20 towards Cu(II) and Pb(II)

379

were retained even after five regeneration cycles. Specifically, CALF-20 exhibited an adsorption

380

capacity of 95 mg/g and 80 mg/g for Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively, at the first adsorption

381

attempt. After five adsorption-desorption cycles, CALF-20 could retain an adsorption capacity of

382

93% for Cu(II) and 90% for Pb(II). This high regeneration efficiency highlights the structural

383

robustness and chemical stability of CALF-20. These characteristics of CALF-20 also make it

384

possible for industrial applications, and the ability to reuse adsorbents without significant loss in

385

performance is crucial for controlling operation costs.

3.5 Multi-ion adsorption

390

To assess the performance of CALF-20 for the removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) in the presence of

391

competing cations, an aqueous solution containing five metal ions, including Cu(II), Pb(II),

392

Ni(II), Cr(III), and Fe(III), at varying concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 5.30 ppm, simulating

393

real coal mine wastewater35, was utilized. The results, summarized in Table S6 and Figure 6,

394

demonstrate that with CALF-20 dosages ranging from 0.25 to 2 g/L, all metal ions can be

395

effectively removed simultaneously. Specifically, a removal rate exceeding 99% for Cu(II), 95%

396

for Cr(III), and 90% for Ni(II) was achieved. Conversely, the removal efficiency for Pb(II)

397

ranged between 75-82%. These outcomes are consistent with the single-component adsorption

398

test results, confirming CALF-20 is a desirable adsorbent for simultaneous removal of multiple

399

metal contaminants. This analysis can be extended further by considering the cost of the MOF

400

adsorbent associated with its performance. CALF-20 can be produced at USD $29 per kg42 at the

3.6 Fixed-bed dynamic breakthrough

407

A fixed bed dynamic breakthrough experiment was carried out to evaluate the competitive Cu(II)

408

and Pb(II) adsorption on CALF-20. CALF-20 powder was packed in the fixed bed column where

409

an eluant with 5.8 ppm Cu(II) and 4.0 ppm Pb(II) ion was applied35. During the experiment, the

410

concentration of metal ions in the effluent was monitored by an ICP-OES instrument. The time

411

that effluent first transverses the column and the first-time heavy metal ions were detected in the

412

effluent were defined as the time zero and the breakthrough point, respectively. The

413

concentration of detected points as a function of time was plotted in Figure 7 and the Thomas

414

model63 was applied for data fitting. As shown in Figure 7, Cu(II) has a breakthrough point of

415

380 minutes while Pb(II) starts to appear in the effluent at 30 minutes. The Thomas model, based

on the Langmuir isotherm model, was employed to characterize the breakthrough curves in

4. CONCLUSION

424

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation into the use of CALF-20, a zinc-based

425

MOF, for the efficient removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solutions. Synthesized at room

426

temperature using water and methanol as green solvents and low-cost, commercially available

427

reagents, CALF-20 offers a highly cost-effective and scalable alternative to conventional MOF

428

adsorbents. It demonstrated outstanding adsorption capacities of 250 mg/g for Cu(II) and 833

429

mg/g for Pb(II) at pH 5.3, respectively, outperforming many MOF adsorbents previously

430

reported. Kinetic studies confirmed the pseudo-second-order behavior, while adsorption isotherm

431

followed the Langmuir model. In a complex multi-ion environment, CALF-20 maintained good

432

ability to remove multiple metal ions simultaneously, removing over 99% of Cu(II) and 82% of

433

Pb(II), even at low dosages. Notably, the material retained over 90% of its capacity after five

434

adsorption-desorption cycles, highlighting its long-term stability and reusability. The combined

435

advantages of economic synthesis, industrial scalability, excellent adsorption performance, and

436

regeneration capability position CALF-20 as a promising candidate for real-world industrial

437

water treatment and environmental remediation.
