Abstract
In seawater most dissolved copper (Cu) is complexed by organic ligands, many of which
are thought to be produced by phytoplankton. Although very little is known about the
composition and structure of these ligands, they play an important role in determining the
reactivity and bioavailability of Cu. In this study, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, a marine diatom
known to produce Cu ligands (CuLs), was grown in laboratory pure culture and the CuLs
recovered from the growth media. Using liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution
tandem mass spectrometry, eleven Cu ligand complexes were identified and assigned molecular
formulae. Molecular formulae were confirmed by comparing the expected and observed relative
abundances of 15N, 13C, 65Cu, and 18O isotopologues. The CuLs had molecular weights from 520
to 719 Da and molecular formulae of C26-35H23-36O5-9N3-4Cu with an average assignment error of
56 ppb. High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry of the Cu-bound and metal-free ligands
revealed these to be a suite of tri- and tetrapyrroles stabilized through complexation of Cu by N.
The ligands share similar parent structures but differ in the number, type, and arrangement of
functional groups that decorate the pyrroles. The similarity of CuL structures with known
catabolites of chlorophyll suggests these ligands may be widely produced by marine
photoautotrophs.
Introduction
Copper (Cu) is a redox active metal, which makes it suitable for various essential cellular
processes such electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration,1,2 the breakdown of reactive
oxygen species,3,4 and uptake of iron.5 However, the same redox properties that make Cu
beneficial can be toxic when concentrations exceed what can be properly handled by the cell,
resulting in decreased cell growth and ultimately leading to cell death.6–9 The most bioavailable
and toxic form of Cu is the cupric ion (Cu2+).5,6,10 The toxicity threshold for especially sensitive
microbes, such as cyanobacteria,6,11 can be as low as 10-13 M, which is within the range of
environmental Cu2+ concentrations in seawater (10-15 to 10-12 M).12,13 One strategy microbes
employ to mitigate the toxicity of Cu2+ is to produce organic ligands that complex Cu to make it
less (or not at all) bioavailable.14,15 For example, phytochelatins (oligomers of glutathione) and
metallothioneins (a family of low molecular weight proteins) form strong complexes with Cu2+
and have been shown to be produced in response to Cu toxicity.16–18
In seawater, dissolved Cu is almost entirely complexed by organic ligands (CuL).19
Remobilization of the ligand-bound Cu is governed by the structure of the ligand which plays a
role in determining the strength of complexation, influencing its photo-reactivity and ultimately
the bioavailability of Cu.20 The detection and identification of CuLs in seawater has been
plagued by analytical challenges common to marine samples – high concentrations of salts, low
concentrations of individual CuLs, and an ultracomplex background organic matrix. A few
studies have characterized CuLs in seawater using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance
mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS).21,22 These studies, which distinguish CuLs from other organic
compounds by the mass difference and relative abundance of 63Cu and 65Cu ions, found more
than 500 putative Cu-containing molecular ions. However, molecular formulae could only be
assigned to 66 of these ions. This study used several conservative knock-out criteria to
determine the molecular formula in the event of unambiguous assignment, leading to the low
percent of putative Cu-containing ions with a formula assignment. A contributing factor is the
allowed assignment error of ± 0.5 ppm – with higher resolution instruments this error range can

be decreased, resulting in a higher percentage of unambiguous formula assignments. The Cucontaining ions ranged in m/z from 237 to 689 and all contained 1-5 N atoms. In addition to N,
12, 17, and 34 of the molecular ions also contained O (without S), S (without O), or both O and
S, respectively. To date, only one study has provided deeper insight to the structural
characteristics of a CuL isolated from seawater. Using a combination of FT-ICR MS and
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) coupled to liquid chromatography
(LC), an abundant CuL with the molecular formula [C20H21N4O8S2Cu]+ was isolated from
seawater collected in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean.23 Based on high resolution
fragmentation data, the authors concluded that the ligand had heavily conjugated, cyclic, azolelike functional groups, that the sulfur was present as thiols, and that the Cu was complexed by N.
The O:C (0.4) and N:C (0.2) ratios of this CuL are consistent with a peptide-like compound,24
with a high degree of unsaturation.
Diatoms, a globally important group of eukaryotic phytoplankton, have many metabolic
uses for Cu, including in iron acquisition5,25,26 and electron transport.27 Diatoms are known to
produce ligands that complex copper,28 and recently it has been shown that the diatoms
Thalassiosira oceanica and Phaeodactylum tricornutum can acquire Cu complexed to
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) through a reductive pathway,29,30 which suggests that at
least some portion of organically bound Cu in seawater could be bioavailable to diatoms.
Although diatoms have a metabolic requirement for Cu, they are still susceptible to cellular
damage and death due to high concentrations of Cu, and some diatoms have been shown to
respond to high Cu through the intracellular production of phytochelatins.31,32 Here we report
the structural characterization of CuLs produced by the widely studied marine diatom P.
tricornutum using the custom-built hybrid linear ion trap 21 tesla FT-ICR MS at the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory.33 This instrument achieves the high mass resolving power,
acquisition speed, dynamic range, and mass accuracy needed for analyzing complex organic
matricies,34,35 and is uniquely suited to provide structural characterization of marine CuLs.
Methods
Materials and Reagents.
Polycarbonate culture bottles, PTFE tubing, and silicone tubing were soaked in 1%
detergent (Citranox) for one week, rinsed with deionized water, soaked in 10% HCl (Trace Metal
Grade, Fisher Scientific) for another week, then rinsed with ultrapure water (qH2O, 18 MW cm-1)
before use. Solid phase extraction columns (1 g, 6 mL Bond Elut ENV, Agilent) were activated
by passing 6 mL of methanol (MeOH) through the resin, rinsed with 6 mL of pH 2 qH2O
followed by 6 mL of qH2O. A 1 µM aqueous cyanocobalamin (Sigma Aldrich) solution was
used as an internal standard. For analyses coupling liquid chromatography (LC) with inductively
coupled plasma MS (ICP MS), LC-MS grade methanol, ammonium formate (Optima, Fisher
Scientific), and qH2O were used. The methanol was redistilled using a polytetrafluoroethlene
(PTFE) still to reduce metal contaminants. For LC-FT-ICR MS analyses, LC-MS grade water,
methanol, and ammonium formate (Honeywell) were used.
Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCMP 632 Culture.
An axenic culture of P. tricornutum CCMP 632 (National Center for Marine Algae and
Microbiota, Bigelow Laboratory, Boothbay, Maine) was grown at 18 °C in polycarbonate bottles
under continuous illumination (90 µmol m-2 s-1). The culture medium was prepared using 0.2 µm

filtered coastal seawater that was autoclaved to sterilize then amended with macro- and micronutrients as detailed in the supplementary information (SI Table 1). All nutrients were sterile
filtered (0.2 µm PES) prior to addition to sterilized seawater. Cultures were maintained by sterile
technique and the absence of bacteria was confirmed via DAPI stained samples. Relative
chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored (Turner TD-700) as a proxy for growth (SI Fig. 1).
Cultures were harvested during the exponential growth phase.
Characterization of culture extracts by LC-ICPMS.
Filtered medium (0.22 µm; Sterivex, Millipore) was pumped through an activated 1 g
Bond Elut ENV SPE column at a flow rate of 10 mL min-1. A medium blank was prepared with
the culture medium without inoculation, incubated alongside the culture, and processed in the
same way. SPE columns were rinsed with 6 mL of qH2O to remove salts, and CuLs eluted with
12 mL of MeOH. The MeOH eluents were concentrated to approximately 1 mL using a
SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific) at 35 °C for 3 hours. MeOH extracts from five, 1 L
cultures were combined and stored in 100% MeOH at -20 °C until analysis.
CuLs were separated on a Zorbax SB-C18 column (0.5 x 150 mm, 5 µm particles), at a
flow rate of 40 µL min-1 and a 30-minute gradient from 95/5% to 5/95% solvent A/B followed by
a 5-minute isocratic hold at 5/95% solvent A/B (solvent A = 5 mM ammonium formate in qH2O,
solvent B = 5 mM ammonium formate in MeOH). The column flow was directed into an iCAP
Q MS (Thermo Scientific) fitted with a perfluoroalkoxy micronebulizer (PFA LC-2040,
Elemental Scientific) and a cyclonic spray chamber cooled to 4 °C. Oxygen was introduced at
25 mL min-1 to minimize formation of reduced carbon deposits on the skimmer and sampler
cones. Data was collected in kinetic energy discrimination mode with helium as the collision
gas. The 63Cu and 65Cu ions were monitored with integration times of 0.1 and 0.05 s
respectively. Analysis of the culture and medium blank extracts showed that all CuLs were
produced by P. tricornutum as there were no detectable CuLs in the medium blank (Fig. 1).
Additionally, there were no coeluting features in the chromatograms of other bioactive metals
such as iron and nickel.

These chromatographic conditions were additionally coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion MS
(Thermo Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source operated in
positive mode at 3500 V. The sheath and aux gas were set to 25 and 5 arbitrary units
respectively. The ion transfer tube was set to 275 °C and the vaporizer temperature was set to 75
°C. MS1 spectra were collected with a resolving power of 500,000 at m/z 200. Cyanocobalamin
was spiked into the sample at a concentration of 50 nM and used to align the LC-ICP and LCOrbitrap mass spectra. Data files were converted to an mzXML format using MSconvert
(Proteowizard) and processed using an algorithm to identify Cu-containing compounds

Da, the mass difference between 63Cu and 65Cu. An error of ± 1.5 mDa was allowed. Manual
validation of isotopologue relative abundance (RA) ratios of 2.24 confirms the presence of Cu.
Characterization of Cu Ligands by LC-FT-ICR MS.
A Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Scientific) LC was coupled to the front end of a
custom-built hybrid linear ion trap FT-ICR MS equipped with a 21 T superconducting magnet.33
CuLs were separated using a 30 min gradient from 95/5% to 5/95% solvent A/B (solvent A = 5
mM ammonium formate in water, solvent B = 5 mM ammonium formate in MeOH) on a Zorbax
SB-C18 column (40 oC; 0.5 x 150 mm, 5 µm particles, Agilent) at 40 µL min-1. The eluent was
coupled to a HESI source operated in positive mode (4.5 kV). The inlet capillary and source
heater temperatures were set to 350 °C and 75 °C, and sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates were
set to 5 and 3 (arbitrary units). MS1 spectra were collected from 150 to 1500 m/z. All spectra
were collected with a resolution of 1,200,000 at 400 m/z, an automatic gain control (AGC) target
of 1x106 charges, and a maximum ion injection time of 1500 ms. The achieved mass spectral
resolving power at m/z 200 was ~1,700,000-3,000,000 across the LC gradient.
CuL candidates identified by LC-Orbitrap analyses were extracted from the LC-FT-ICR
MS data to obtain ultrahigh resolution m/z to allow for the unambiguous assignment of molecular
formulae. Metal-free ligands were found by searching for the presence of a molecular ion at a
m/z occurring at 61.92177 Da or 60.91395 Da lower than the m/z of CuL complex, which
correspond to the Cu(I) or Cu(II) oxidation states. All metal-free ligands identified were present
at m/z 60.91395 lower than the CuL, indicating a +2 oxidation state of the Cu. Elemental
compositions were assigned using the Predator Molecular Formula Calculator (v.1.3.3), with
elemental constraints of C∞H∞O0-15N0-10Cu1 ± 2.5 ppm for CuLs and C∞H∞O0-15N0-10 ± 2.5 ppm
for metal-free ligand assignments. No 34S isotope peak was observed for any Cu or metal-free
ligands, therefore sulfur was excluded from elemental constraints.
Cu and metal-free ligands were targeted for tandem mass spectrometry (MS2)
experiments to elucidate structural characteristics. LC and HESI source settings were the same
as in MS1 analyses, except the voltage was set to 3.75 kV and MS1 spectra were collected from
455 to 1015 m/z with a resolution of 600,000 at m/z 400. MS2 spectra were collected in the ICR
cell using an isolation width of 0.6 Da and a maximum ion injection time of 500 ms at a
resolution of 600,000 at m/z 400. Ions were fragmented via collision induced dissociation (CID)
with a normalized collisional energy of 40, activation Q of 0.25, and an activation time of 10 ms.
Select fragment ions were targeted for MS3 experiments in the linear ion trap using the same
settings as for the MS2 experiments.
Results and Discussion
Characterization of Cu Ligands by LC-ICP-ESI MS
Copper ligands (CuLs) isolated from spent P. tricornutum medium include an unresolved
complex mixture of CuLs that appear as a gradual rise and fall in the baseline of the LC-ICP MS
63
Cu chromatogram topped with a number of defined peaks (Fig. 1a). To identify molecular ions
corresponding to CuL complexes, samples were analyzed by LC- Orbitrap using the same
chromatographic conditions. CuLs were identified based on the mass difference and RA of 63Cu
and 65Cu peaks and alignment with the LC-ICP MS chromatogram. Eleven putative CuLs (A-K)
were identified, with m/z ratios between 521 and 720 that elute between 19 and 38 minutes (Fig.

CuLs, higher resolution m/z were required.
Isotopic Fine Structure Confirms Elemental Composition of Formula Assignments
The high mass accuracy achievable by FT-ICR MS at 21T allows for the unambiguous
assignment of molecular formulae to molecular ions. The presence of Cu was confirmed in all
eleven CuLs, with an experimental mass difference between 63Cu and 65Cu of 1.99821 ± 0.00001
Da (Dmtheoretical, 1.99819 Da) and a 65Cu to 63Cu ratio of 2.3 ± 0.4 (SI Fig. 2). Molecular
formulae were assigned to all CuLs with absolute errors between 6 and 100 ppb (Table 1).

All molecular formula assignments were confirmed by their isotope fine structure – the
presence of heavy isotope peaks (e.g. 15N, 13C, 18O, 65Cu) at a RA predicted from the number of
each element in the formula obtained using LC-FT-ICR MS at 21T. The theoretical isotope fine
structure for each formula assignment was simulated using IsoPro 3.1 at the achieved resolving
power for that m/z and compared to the measured isotope fine structure (Fig. 2).

To assess how well the measured values matched the theoretical values, the difference
between the measured and theoretical isotope split (mass difference between the heavy isotope
and the monoisotopic peak) and RA for each isotope peak was calculated. This analysis showed
that the isotope split was accurate to ± 0.1 mDa for all heavy isotope peaks and the RA was
accurate to ± 5% for heavy isotope peaks with S/N > 30 (SI Fig. 2). Heavy isotope peaks with
S/N < 30 showed larger deviations from the theoretical RA, from -21.8 to 9.6%. The CuLs in
this study all had 26-35 carbon atoms, 5-9 oxygen atoms, and 3-4 nitrogen atoms. The
corresponding metal-free ligands had H:C ratios from 0.96 to 1.09, O:C ratios from 0.18 to 0.30,
and N:C ratios from 0.11 to 0.13 (Table 2). The ligands produced by P. tricornutum fall within
a narrow compositional space, based on their elemental ratios. In fact, many of the ligands are
related by systematic differences, such as a CH2, O, and H2.

P. tricornutum CuLs as tri- and tetrapyrroles
The elemental composition of CuLs ligands (C26-35, H23-36, O5-8, N3-4) suggests similarities
to breakdown products of the well-known and ubiquitous biomolecule, chlorophyll (C35, H34, O5,
N4 for chlorophyllide a). Chlorophyll has a macrocyclic tetrapyrrole ring system of four
substituted pyrroles (labeled A-D) connected by methine (meso-carbon) bridges (Fig. 3). There
is also a ring (E) that is not a pyrrole positioned exocyclic to the macrocycle. Enzymatic
catabolism of chlorophylls a and b begins with demetallation (loss of Mg2+) and ester hydrolysis
(loss of phytol), followed by oxygenolytic opening of the macrocycle between rings A and D to
form a red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC; Fig. 3).37 RCC has an H:C ratio of 1.09, O:C ratio of
0.2, and N:C ratio of 0.11, values that all fall within the ranges observed for the CuLs produced
by P. tricornutum. Subsequent catabolism of RCC produces di-, tri-, and tetrapyrroles decorated
with a suite of different functional groups. These catabolites have characteristic fragmentation
pathways that include: (1) the loss of CH4O from a methoxycarbonyl functional group on ring E,
(2) loss of H2O and CO, (3) fragmentation at the meso-carbon positions with loss of pyrroles and
(4) decarboxylation reactions (loss of CO2, CH2O2) (Fig. 3).38–40

Due to low analyte abundance and ion suppression from a complex organic matrix
(10,369 features across the gradient) that co-elute with CuLs, it was not possible to acquire high
quality MS2 spectra for CuLs A, B, and J. However, the MS2 spectra of the 8 remaining CuLs
contain major fragment ions that correspond to losses of CH4O and/or CO2, and minor fragment
ions arising from the loss of substituted pyrrole(s). For example, the MS2 spectrum of CuL G,
[C32H32O7N4Cu + H]+, with m/z of 648.16389 (Fig. 4) was dominated by two fragment ions at
m/z 633.14055, [C₃₁H₃₀O₇N₄Cu]+, and 576.17925, [C₃₀H₃₃O₄N₄Cu]+, which represent small
neutral losses [M – CH3]•+ and [M – (CO2 + CO)]+ (Table 3). There are also three fragment ions
of lower relative abundance (< 5%) at m/z 495.12138, 483.12138, and 468.09790 with molecular
formulae [C₂₅H₂₆O₄N₃⁶³Cu]+, [C₂₄H₂₆O₄N₃⁶³Cu]+, [C₂₃H₂₃O₄N₃Cu]+, representing the loss of an Ncontaining moiety, C7H7O3N, C8H7O3N, and C9H10O3N, respectively. The low abundance of
ions indicating loss of pyrrole(s) relative to the high abundance of ions arising from the loss of
methyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl suggests the stabilization of the ligand through coordination with
Cu.

Therefore, the corresponding metal-free ligands were targeted for fragmentation. The
loss of C7H7O3N and C8H7O3N is also observed in the MS2 spectrum of the metal free ligand G
(Fig. 4) as fragment ions at m/z 434.20745, [C₂₅H₂₈O₄N₃]+ and 422.20745, [C₂₄H₂₈O₄N₃]+ (Table
4). In contrast to the MS2 spectrum of the CuL G, the MS2 spectrum for the metal-free ligand
was dominated by fragment ions arising from the loss of N-containing moieties, supporting the
hypothesis that coordination with Cu stabilizes the structure. The N:C ratio of the fragment ions
(0.12 to 0.13) is the same or similar to the parent CuL ion (0.13), which indicates that the
nitrogen is dispersed across the molecule rather than localized, which is consistent with a
tetrapyrrole structure.

A major fragmentation pathway for metal-free ligand G is the sequential loss of CO2 to
produce the fragment ion with nominal m/z 543, followed by the loss of a terminal pyrrole
(C7H7ON) to produce nominal m/z 422, followed by the loss of a second pyrrole (C8H11O2N) to
produce m/z 269 (Fig. 4). The loss of CO2 with the loss of pyrroles has been seen when using
higher fragmentation energies (like that used in this study) on bilin tetrapyrroles, 41 heme
catabolites that are structurally similar to chlorophyll catabolites, though they lack ring E. In
order to confirm the sequential loss of pyrroles from nominal m/z 422, this ion was targeted for
further fragmentation. The MS3 spectrum of m/z 422 (SI Fig. 3a) yielded a fragment ion at m/z
269, confirming the sequential loss of pyrroles from metal-free ligand G. Fragmentation of ion
m/z 269 (SI Fig. 3b), yielded fragment ions at m/z 241.0 ([M – CO]+) and 226.0 ([M – CHON]+),
indicating the presence of a carbonyl and a cyclic amide. 42 Based on the fragmentation patterns
and the similarities to chlorophyll catabolites, a draft structure for metal-free and Cu-bound
ligand G is proposed (Fig. 4). The extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for CuLs A-K yielded
unique peaks for each CuL. In contrast, the corresponding EICs of the metal-free ligands
exhibited multiple peaks (SI Fig. 4). This further supports the stabilization of the ligand
structure by complexation to Cu and suggests that there may be different isomers of each metalfree ligand.43,44
MS2 spectra were obtained for all metal-free ligands except for C and I, and all Cu-bound
ligands except A, B, and J. However, structures of these ligands can be inferred based on
systematic differences stemming from their molecular formulae. Ligand C differs from ligand B
by the addition of a CH2 and elutes slightly later in the LC-ESI MS chromatogram (Fig. 1b).
Therefore, we infer that ligand C is a homologue of ligand B. Similarly, ligand I differs from

ligand H by an H2, and from ligand J by an O. Given this, we infer that ligands H, I, and J have
the same parent structure with ligand I having an additional double bond compared to H and an
alcohol functionality compared to J. This is supported by the MS2 spectra of metal-free ligands
H and J which have nine fragment ions in common (SI Fig. 5). While the MS2 spectrum of CuL
J was not acquired, spectra for CuLs H and I show five fragment ions in common and four
fragment ions that differ by an H2 (SI Fig. 6).
The MS2 spectra show that the suite of ligands produced by P. tricornutum are
structurally related (Table 5). Major fragment ions m/z 422 and 269 observed in the MS2
spectrum of metal-free ligand G are also observed in the MS2 spectra of metal-free ligands D, F,
H, and J. While the MS2 spectrum of metal-free ligand E does not contain m/z 422 or 269, it
does contain m/z 420 and 267 indicating an additional unsaturation.

Given these similarities, it is likely that the tetrapyrrole ligands B-J share the same parent
structure but differ in the number, type, and arrangement of functional group substitutions (Fig.
5). The other two ligands detected, A and K, are likely tripyrroles as the same fragmentation
pathways are observed (loss of methoxycarbonyl, H2O, CO, pyrrole ring, decarboxylation).
Interestingly, the tripyrroles were present as both the metal-free and Cu-bound ligands,
indicating that the ligands produced by P. tricornutum are tri-dentate ligands, which is consistent
with metal-bound complexes of chlorophyll catabolites.45,46

Comparison with Existing Cu Ligand Compositional Data
Although nearly all Cu dissolved in seawater is bound to organic ligands, the structures
of these ligands remain uncharacterized. To the best of our knowledge there is only one
published high resolution MS2 spectrum for a CuL detected in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific
(ETSP).23 Compositionally, the ETSP ligand, [C20H21O8S2N4]+, is similar to the ligands we
characterized from P. tricornutum in that it has four N atoms and an H:C ratio of 1.0, which falls
within the range of H:C ratios found in this study (0.96 to 1.09). However, there are two
significant differences: the ETSP ligand contains two S heteroatoms and was found to bind Ni as
well as Cu, while the ligands from P. tricornutum did not contain S and were specific to Cu.
Additionally, the O:C and N:C ratios of the ETSP ligand, 0.4 and 0.19, respectively, were above
the ranges found in this study (0.18 to 0.30 and 0.11 to 0.13, respectively). These compositional
differences indicate that the ETSP ligand is more protein-like than the ligands in this study.24
Chlorophyll catabolites of higher plants readily form complexes with metals such as
2+
Zn , Ni2+, and Cu2+ and it has been suggested that this may point to a biological role of heavy

metal detoxification.45,46 Given the structural similarities between the CuLs in P. tricornutum
media extracts and chlorophyll catabolites, it is possible that CuLs may likewise play a role in
Cu detoxification. In order to determine this, the strength of the CuL complexes needs to be
determined and further experiments with cultures grown under different Cu concentrations up to
the toxicity threshold of P. tricornutum need to be made. The structural information provided by
our study may help with these studies and in further characterizing CuLs in environmental
samples.
Conclusions
Spent culture media from the marine diatom P. tricornutum was analyzed by LC-FT-ICR
MS at 21 T to characterize CuLs. Eleven CuLs were detected and assigned molecular formulae,
which were confirmed through an analysis of their 15N, 13C, and 18O isotopologues. The ligands
are highly oxidized and rich in nitrogen, with O:C and N:C ratios of 0.18-0.30 and 0.11-0.13,
respectively, and the Cu ion was in the +2 oxidation state. Tandem MS2 and MS3 spectra of
CuLs and their metal-free analogues yielded diagnostic ions from fragmentation pathways
characteristic of tri- and tetrapyrroles. These ligands are tri-dentate and bind Cu through
coordination with nitrogen, similar to a CuL previously characterized from seawater. However,
unlike the single CuL previously characterized from seawater, the CuLs isolated from P.
tricornutum media were specific for Cu and did not bind Ni. Draft structures of P. tricornutum
CuLs show strong similarities to known chlorophyll catabolites, suggesting that the CuLs
characterized here maybe widely produced by marine photoautotrophs.
