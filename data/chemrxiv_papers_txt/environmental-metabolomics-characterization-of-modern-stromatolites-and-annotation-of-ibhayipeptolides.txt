Abstract
Lithified layers of complex microbial mats known as microbialites are ubiquitous in the
fossil record, and modern forms are increasingly identified globally. A key challenge to developing
an understanding of microbialite formation and environmental role is how to investigate complex
and diverse communities in situ. We selected living, layered microbialites (stromatolites) in a
peritidal environment near Schoenmakerskop, Eastern Cape, South Africa to conduct a spatial
survey mapping the composition and small molecule production of the microbial communities
from environmental samples. Substrate core samples were collected from nine sampling stations
ranging from the upper point of the freshwater inflow to the lower marine interface where tidal
overtopping takes place. Substrate cores provided material for parallel analyses of microbial
community diversity by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolomics using LC–MS2.
Species and metabolite diversities were correlated, and prominent specialized metabolites were
targeted for preliminary characterization. A new series of cyclic hexadepsipeptides, named
ibhayipeptolides, was most abundant in substrate cores of submerged microbialites. These results
demonstrate the detection and identification of metabolites from mass-limited environmental
samples and contribute knowledge about microbialite chemistry and biology, which facilitates
future targeted studies of specialized metabolite function and biosynthesis.

Introduction
The role of metabolism on microbial community structure at local spatial scales is a central
question in microbial chemical ecology [1] that is most often approached by (meta)genomic
analyses of microbial metabolic capacity [2,3]. The potential for chemical communication
networks to structure microbial communities is well recognized [4], although in situ detection of
metabolites at low, highly variable abundances in complex environmental samples remains
difficult. In addition to limitations in instrument technology, a lack of characterized metabolite
structures in centralized databases makes reliable annotation of the hundreds to thousands of mass
spectrometric (MS) features detected by untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) methods challenging. The coupling of untargeted metabolomics to microbial community
data and metagenomics for analysis of complex microbial communities was demonstrated recently
by Tuttle et al. who deployed adsorption resins for direct sampling of metabolites in marine
sediments [5]. These integrated analyses have been enabled by technological advances in high
resolution mass spectrometry and associated data analysis tools [6]. In particular, computational
mass spectrometry tools enable predictions of metabolite structure or structure class based on
tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) fragmentation patterns, which require only nanograms of
chemical extract from environmental samples. GNPS [7] is an open-access platform for
comparative networking and searching of publicly shared MS2 spectra and available spectral
databases. The SIRIUS5 suite [8] incorporates a collection of software tools to perform molecular
formula, structure, and compound class predictions from MS2 spectra. Its core module SIRIUS
analyzes isotope patterns and computes fragmentation trees to achieve molecular formula
prediction, while the incorporated CSI:FingerID [9] uses these fragmentation trees to generate

molecular fingerprints that facilitate structure predictions. These molecular fingerprints are also
used by the module CANOPUS [10–12] to predict structural classes of metabolites through a deep
neural network. Such integrated approaches enable the structural annotation of microbial
metabolites directly from chemically complex and scarce environmental samples [4] even when
no spectral match to characterized metabolite structures in centralized databases is found.
Microbialites are organo-sedimentary deposits formed by the metabolic activity of
microbial communities that induce the precipitation of minerals and trapped sediments to form
structures that can be amorphous, clotted (thrombolites), or layered (stromatolites) [13]. They are
ubiquitous in the fossil record, dating back to the Archaean and Precambrian eras [14–17]. Extant
microbialites occur in temperate (marine and freshwater) as well as extreme environments that
include hypersaline lagoons [18]. They have been documented primarily from sites in Western
Australia [19], the Bahamas [20], South/Central America [21], North America [22,23], and South
Africa [24,25], with highly diverse microbial community structures and metabolisms. Supratidal
microbialites on rocky coasts have been described since 2003 [26], and these distinct siliciclastic
environments are characterized as representative of ancient microbialite beds along Precambrian
coastlines [27]. The presence of modern microbialites provides an opportunity to investigate
biomineralized microbial communities as a source of specialized metabolites, which are small
organic molecules produced by organisms that increase survivability and fecundity but are not
essential for survival.
In studies of microbialite communities, molecular approaches have provided phylogenetic
profiles, based on 16S/18S SSU rRNA genes that identified taxonomically diverse consortia,
representing different functional guilds, for example, photosynthesis, sulfate reduction, sulfide
oxidation, heterotrophy, carbohydrate metabolism, and carbonate accretion [28–33]. Metagenomic

studies of actively-growing microbialites have corroborated the presence of genes for the
biochemical pathways expected for these functional guilds, and comparative metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic analyses have been used to study the expression of genes associated with
calcium carbonate accretion [34,35]. While metagenomic studies of microbialites may identify
patterns of biosynthetic potential across different habitats, the context and levels of expression of
metabolites and their potential ecological roles remain speculative. There are very few studies on
the detection, characterization or biogenesis of small molecule metabolites produced by
microbialites. Lipid profiles have been compared between microbialites and non-lithified
microbial mats from the hypersaline Hamelin Pool in Shark Bay, Australia [36]. Putative
assignment of cyanobacterial cyanopeptolin S and 21-bromo-oscillatoxin A by mass spectrometric
analysis has been reported [37]. Production of natural microbial sunscreens, scytonemin and
mycosporine-like amino acids, has also been studied in Shark Bay microbialites [38].
The first detailed report of coastal microbialites in South Africa documented the formation
of tufa microbialites in upper intertidal rock pools fed by non-saline groundwater near the Kei
River in the north of the Eastern Cape province [39]. Subsequently, similar occurrences of
microbialites were recorded along 200 km (124 miles) of coastline in the Eastern Cape [24]. These
formations are now known to be ubiquitous along the coastline of southern Africa, from
Brandsebaai, South Africa, in the west to Tofo, Mozambique in the east [25]. The
Schoenmakerskop tufa microbialite formation (Fig S1) has been the subject of a number of
hydrochemical [40], microbial [24,41], and associated metazoan studies [42–44]. These studies
provided evidence of new and known cyanobacterial and other taxa, some of which are related to
known producers of specialized metabolites with varied biological functions. Thus, we selected
the Schoenmakerskop microbialite system to demonstrate the utility of untargeted metabolomics

for analyzing environmental microbialite samples and to conduct an initial spatial survey of the
study site that would inform future metagenomic deep sequence analyses.
At Schoenmakerskop, microbialites form a shallow barrage pool that is fed by diffuse
freshwater input on the landward side and experiences marine tidal over-topping (flooding with
seawater at high tide) at the seaward edge, leading to significant cycling in temperature and salinity
[40]. Our primary goal was to assess the bacterial and small molecule composition of actively
accreting microbialites by simultaneously comparing the diversity of prokaryotic species and
chemistry in samples collected across the pool at established flag stations, spaced 3-5 m apart (Fig
S2). We sought to structurally classify and identify prominent and or new specialized metabolites
that may be the same or different from those reported from cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria,
or other microbes in non-lithified microbial mats. Chemical extraction of substrate cores (Fig S3)
for LC–MS2 profiling and computational analyses to compare and structurally classify MS
features, were paired with DNA extraction of substrate cores for phylogenetic analyses of the
microbial community using 16S rDNA sequencing. Metabolomic analyses of the variation
between samples collected across the pool led to the identification of a new class of depsipeptides,
named ibhayipeptolides for ‘iBhayi’, which is the regional name by which Algoa Bay is known.
Spearman rank correlations of MS features with bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequences based
on abundances indicated an association of the ibhayipeptolides with cyanobacterial and
bacteroidete taxa.

Results and Discussion
Substrate cores obtained from collections made at two low tides on consecutive days were

categorized according to their source location, as either submerged or surface exposed. Samples
assigned to the submerged category were either completely submerged in standing water or at the
water interface, while samples assigned to the surface exposed category were exposed to air or
flowing water. In general, cores collected from the same flag station all fit into the same category
of either surface exposed or submerged (flag stations 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10; Figs 1A, 1B, and S4S12). Two exceptions were flag stations 3 (Fig S6) and 6 (Fig S9), where substrate cores collected
ranged from surface exposed to submerged in standing water. Based on bacterial community
compositions discussed in detail below (Fig 2), and for clarity in presentation of this work, flag
station 3 is considered to be surface exposed and flag station 6 as submerged (Figs 1A and 1B).
A total of 1,567,727 reads, clustered into 12,498 OTUs, were recovered from all core
samples collected across the stromatolite barrage pool (Fig 1A). The OTUs were classified within
613 different families, 361 orders, 150 classes and 51 bacterial phyla. At least 1,111 (8.9%) OTUs
could not be classified beyond the bacterial kingdom. Approximately 30% of all OTUs were
classified within Phylum Proteobacteria, and 16% classified within Phylum Bacteroidetes. The
number of OTUs per phylum did not, however, correlate with the abundance of OTUs per phylum.
The most abundant OTUs were classified within the Cyanobacteria phylum (33% relative
abundance across all sites), with OTUs classified within the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes
phyla accounting for 23% and 18% of total relative OTU abundance across all sites. Unclassified
families in the Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia, as well as the
Omnitrophicaeota and Saprospiraceae families, accounted for 15% of all OTUs, with each
consisting of approximately 3% of all OTUs. All other families accounted for 2% or less of all
OTUs.

LC–MS2 raw data for all substrate cores was processed with MZMine2. Subsequent blank
subtraction and removal of MS features found solely in the washout phase of the LC gradient
resulted in a total of 15,752 MS features and 5,997 pairs of different ion species (e.g., [M+H]+,
[M+Na]+) of the same molecule being identified, based on the correlation of chromatographic peak
shapes for MS features [45]. Feature based molecular networking (FBMN) using GNPS resulted
in 15,752 nodes with 25,894 edges (21,165 MS2 cosine scores greater than 0.7 and 4,729 MS1
annotations). Of the total number of nodes, 6,005 shared an edge with another node, leaving 9,747
singletons. Only 487 nodes (3.1%) were annotated with spectral similarities and precursor m/z
matches to metabolites in GNPS spectral libraries. MS features were assigned to 1,287 different
structural classes using CANOPUS.

MS features associated with Bray–Curtis distances between samples and are described in Table 1.

Bacterial diversity in microbialite cores across flag stations
Initially, we mapped the taxonomic diversity of the microbial communities to assess
variability across the sampling stations, focusing on bacteria, which have been shown in a previous
shotgun metagenomic study to comprise > 98% of the total microbial community [41]. We
analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries, acquired in parallel with LC–MS2 data, for samples
at each flag station (Figs 1C and 1D). An assessment of beta diversity in the bacterial community
by NMDS and ANOSIM (both Bray–Curtis distance) revealed that all flag stations (Fig 1C) were
significantly different from one another (p < 0.05, Table S1). However, the level of dissimilarity,

as indicated by the R statistic, suggested separate grouping of A) flag station 1 samples from the
freshwater inflow as unique and unlike all other sites, B) samples from flag stations 3, 8 and 10,
which were all described as exposed to flowing water and shared low R values, and C) samples
from generally submerged flag stations 4, 5, 6, and 7, with similarly low R values, and flag station
2 samples, which shared some similarity with those from 4 and 5 (see Table S1). A canonicalcorrelation analysis (CCA, Fig S13) of the bacterial OTUs showed that OTUs classified within the
Nostocales class of Cyanobacteria were prominent members of the surface group of taxa,
responsible for the differences observed between surface (blue) and submerged (red) communities
(PERMANOVA, pseudo-F = 15.98, p = 0.001, Bray-Curtis distance). Phylogenetic classification
of the 16S rRNA gene OTUs showed that almost all the samples were dominated by
Cyanobacteria, followed by taxa classified within the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria.
Vericobacteria and Chloroflexi OTUs were also abundant (Fig S14). The bacterial communities
were dominated by 20 OTUs, which accounted for between 50 to 80 % of all reads across the
sampling stations (Fig S15); nine of these OTUs were conserved in all samples (Fig 2). Closer
inspection revealed that the relative abundances of two conserved cyanobacterial OTUs classified
as Nostocales (OTU1 and OTU5) were significantly more abundant in samples from the flag
stations exposed to flowing water (Fig 1B: flags 1, 3, 8 and 10; Fig 2). OTU1 shared the greatest
nucleotide sequence identity with Calothrix species, and OTU5 was most closely related to matforming Microcoleus and Phormidium species (Fig 3). OTU5 is the only OTU that corresponds to
a conserved OTU identified in a previous study of Schoenmakerskop and Cape Recife [41],
suggesting that this species may be important for peritidal microbialite growth. Furthermore,
Microcoleus species are reported to withstand high salinity [46], an attribute that may help these
bacteria survive the periodic increases in salinity due to tidal over-topping of the stromatolite

barrage pool. OTU2 and OTU3 are conserved across all stations and are dominant in samples from
the submerged sites (flags 2, 4 - 7; Figs 1B and 2). OTU2 and OTU3 are closely related, and share
greatest sequence identity with Plectonema, Rivularia and Calothrix species (Fig 3), which are all
genera found in abundance in other microbialite formations that occur primarily in standing water
bodies [47–51]. Additional data, such as metagenomic-assembled genomes, and associated
transcriptomic data would be required to determine the effect that water flow rate has on the
composition and behaviors of the mosaic of stromatolite-forming bacterial communities.

Fig 2. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon data revealed the presence of nine
conserved bacterial species across all microbialite core samples. Cores were grouped as either
surface exposed or submerged, based on their source flag station, and these two groupings
displayed distinct bacterial communities. In particular, cyanobacterial OTU1 characterized flag
stations exposed to flowing water, and was largely absent from submerged flag stations.

where the unit is the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.

Metabolite diversity of microbialite cores across flag stations
Another goal was to broadly characterize and compare the small molecule composition of
substrate cores across the nine flag stations of the barrage pool. A molecular formula and prediction
of compound structural class were obtained, using SIRIUS4 [8] and CANOPUS [11], respectively,
for each MS feature detected in the pre-processed LC–MS2 data for all core samples. The in silico
annotation tool CANOPUS utilizes deep neural network prediction based on fragmentation spectra
to assign each detected MS feature to a superclass, class, and subclass. A preliminary assessment
of differences between flagged stations across the barrage pool based on the CANOPUS output
indicated that flag station 1 (landward freshwater inflow) and flag station 7 (mid-pool) displayed
marked differences at the superclass and class level in metabolites present at each sampling station
(Fig S16).
Using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA, Bray–Curtis distances) to assess the
separation of MS features by individual flag site revealed that all flag stations (Fig 1E) were
significantly different from one another (PERMANOVA, pseudo-F = 5.68, p = 0.001, Bray–Curtis
distance). However, a greater degree of separation was observed between stations that were
submerged in water versus those that were surface exposed, over which water was flowing (Fig
1F). Statistical significance of the separation between submerged and exposed stations was
confirmed by PERMANOVA analysis, which revealed a pseudo-F score of 14.64 (p-value = 0.001,
Bray–Curtis distance), in agreement with the bacterial community data.

To understand the factors distinguishing submerged and surface exposed flag stations, we
inspected the loading vectors in Fig 1F (Table 1). Discrete MS features can be visualized in the
molecular network as nodes colored by submerged versus surface exposed metadata (Figs 4, S17).
Molecular families are observed as subnetworks of nodes connected by edges that represent MS2
spectra with cosine similarity scores greater than 0.7 (solid light gray lines) or MS1 annotations of
different ion species of the same molecule (dashed dark gray lines). Ion species relationships are
based on retention time matches and Pearson correlations of greater than 85% for chromatographic
peak shape. Only subnetworks containing MS features responsible for separation of samples
between surface and submerged stations are shown (Fig 4). Analysis of the MS2 spectra for ten top
metabolite vectors with SIRIUS5 and CANOPUS (Table 1) predicted they belong to seven
different chemical classes. Diradylglycerols, thiazole-containing macrolides, and depsipeptides
were found primarily in the submerged cores, while fatty alcohols were present primarily in the
surface exposed cores (Figs 4 and S17). Notably, the CANOPUS output for MS feature 7608
predicted epothilone (Table 1), although the large m/z (734.4649) and SIRIUS molecular formula
prediction suggest that MS features in this subnetwork are larger thiazole-containing macrolides
(Figs 4B and S17B). Further structure elucidation is precluded by low abundance and thus poor
quality MS2 spectra (Fig S18).
We found that key MS features responsible for this separation, including MS feature IDs
2198, 880, and 2363, belong to the same family of depsipeptides (Fig 4C). Notably, a
DEREPLICATOR [52] search matched MS feature ID 2198 with the depsipeptide serrawetin, for
which the low score of 7 indicated a match in structural class only, further supporting the prediction
by SIRIUS and CANOPUS (Table 1). Manual inspection of MS2 spectra for these MS features
confirmed a peptidic molecular family and suggested they represent a new family of cyclic

depsipeptides. Therefore, we targeted these prominent MS features for further structural
characterization, assigning them the trivial name of ibhayipeptolides.

features are predicted by CANOPUS to be, (A) diradylglycerols, (B) thiazole-containing

shown.

Spatial distribution of depsipeptides across the barrage pool
Preliminary assessment of the chemical class differences between flag stations using
CANOPUS indicated that stations 4, 5, and 7 were predicted to contain the highest abundance of
depsipeptides, although this structural class was still present at flag stations 1 and 10. CANOPUS
plots of flag stations 1 and 7 are provided as representative examples in Fig S16. GNPS featurebased molecular networking was used to confirm this CANOPUS prediction, and to visualize the
number and extent of depsipeptide MS features across the flag stations (Fig 5). The molecular
network revealed that MS features 2198 and 2363 are most abundant at flag stations 4 (pink), 5
(yellow), and 7 (dark orange). This trend in the presence of depsipeptides across the barrage pool
may correspond with variation in the bacterial community.

Ibhayipeptolides A (networked MS features 2198 [M+H]+ and 880 [M+Na]+) and B (MS
features 8186 [M+H]+ and 2363 [M+Na]+) were targeted for additional structure elucidation and
potential chromatographic isolation since they were prominent PCoA vectors representing
metabolic differences between flag stations and could not be assigned as known compounds from
their LC–MS2 data. Elucidation of their planar structures was assisted by comparison with the MS2
data for two additional congeners designated as ibhayipeptolides C (MS features 8190 [M+H]+
and 8184 [M+Na]+) and D (MS features 8185 [M+H]+ and 2473 [M+Na]+). We anticipated that
knowledge of the ibhayipeptolide structures could be used to guide future investigations of the
ecological role of these prominent microbialite metabolites. For ibhayipeptolide A (MS feature
2198), SIRIUS5 analysis of the molecular ion isotope (Fig S19) and MS2 fragmentation patterns
(Figs S20 and S21) of both positive ([M+H]+ and [M+Na]+) and negative ionization ([M-H]-)
spectra provided a molecular formula of C44H64N4O8 with 15 degrees of unsaturation. The identity
and sequence of the six residues in this predicted depsipeptide (Fig 6A) were determined by
manual analysis of the MS2 spectrum for the [M+Na]+ ion (MS feature 880). Two major MS
fragmentation pathways were described for ibhayipeptolide A, one initiated by b-type cleavage of
an ester and the other initiated by a-type ring cleavage of a α-C/C=O bond (Fig 6A). In pathway
1, ring-opening lactone cleavage of the sodiated ion is followed by sequential loss of amino and
hydroxy acid residues beginning with Phe, then Lxx (representing Leu, Ile or MeVal), an αhydroxybutyric acid (Hba) or equivalent moiety (C4H6O2), and a second Phe, yielding a sodiated
b2 ion (m/z 306.2035, C16H29NO3Na+). In the congruent fragmentation pathway 2, an a-type
sodiated ion (m/z 799.4562) results from ring cleavage at the α-C/C=O bond of a putative long
chain α-hydroxy acid (C10H18O2). A neutral loss of m/z 142.1345 is explained by subsequent btype cleavage and loss of hydroxydecanoic acid (Hda) from the linearized ion. Subsequent

sequential loss of amino and hydroxy acid units culminates in a residual sodiated x1 ion (m/z
164.0677, C7H11NO2Na+) assigned as Lxx–CO. Further support for these fragmentation pathways
was provided by the computed fragmentation tree in SIRIUS, for which each ion in a given
pathway is found in a unique branch (Fig S23). Together these analyses support the sequence of
Phe–Lxx–Hba–Phe–Lxx–Hda.

C45H66N4O8 for ibhayipeptolide C (MS feature 8190), and C46H68N4O8 for ibhayipeptolide D (MS
feature 8185), respectively. Sufficient quantities of ibhayipeptolides could not be isolated for NMR
analysis, yet nearly identical fragmentation patterns in the MS2 spectra for sodiated ions provided
consistent planar structure assignments for all four congeners (Figs S22, S31, S38, and S43).
Ibhayipeptolide B (MS feature 8186) with m/z 785.4438 ([M+Na]+) differed from ibhayipeptolide
A only in the loss of 72.0208 Da between the b4 and b3 ions, instead of 86.0365 Da, in pathway 1,
indicating the presence of a lactic acid residue in ibhayipeptolide B in place of the Hba in
ibhayipeptolide A (Fig S31). Ibhayipeptolide C (MS feature 8184, m/z 813.4764 ([M+Na]+), also
showed two major fragmentation pathways (Fig 6B). Fragmentation pathway 1 again indicates the
presence of a lactic acid residue (b4 - b3 = 72.0215 Da), as for ibhayipeptolide B. In fragmentation
pathway 2 for ibhayipeptolide C, a loss of 170.1664 Da follows the initial a-type cleavage, instead
of 142.1345 Da for ibhayipeptolide A, indicating substitution of a hydroxydodecanoic acid (Hdda)
for the Hda moiety in ibhayipeptolides A and B. An Hba residue was evident (pathway 1, b4 - b3 =
86.0365 Da) in the spectra for ibhayipeptolide D (MS feature 8185) with m/z 827.4910 ([M+Na]+),
while an initial loss of 170.1658 Da in fragmentation pathway 2 was consistent with the presence
of Hdda (Fig S43). Together these data indicate that all four peptides share the same sequence
and have α-hydroxy acids with varying sidechains (Fig 7).

Fig 7. Molecular structure summary for ibhayipeptolides A-D. The ibhayipeptolide planar
structures contain either α-hydroxybutyric acid (Hba, A and D) or lactic acid (B and C), and αhydroxydecanoic acid (Hda, A and B) or α-hydroxydodecanoic acid (Hdda, C and D) residues as
determined by analysis of MS2 fragmentations. Limited NMR data indicates the presence of both
Leu and Ile residues in ibhayipeptolide A (Fig S27), whereas these are unassigned in B-D because
they are not distinguishable from MS2 data.

The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig S24) for ibhayipeptolide A (MS feature 2198) displayed two
NH (δH 7.45, 7.48), ten aromatic (δH 7.1-7.3), two oxymethine (δH 5.15, 5.34), four amino acid αH resonances (δH 3.6-4.6), and a congested aliphatic region (δH 0.6-2.4). A high quality,
comprehensive NMR data set could not be obtained for ibhayipeptolide A due to a paucity of
material isolated (~50 μg). Nevertheless, correlations observed in COSY (Fig S25) and HSQC
(Fig S26) NMR experiments supported the identity of the six residues (Fig S27, Table S2). Spin
systems for two Phe residues and an Hba, incorporating a deshielded α-H signal (δH 5.15), were
present in the COSY spectrum. A Leu residue was delineated by COSY correlations between two
CH3 doublets (δH 0.89, 0.93) and a γ-H multiplet (δH 1.58), along with a spin system including an
NH (δH 7.45), an α-H (δH 4.19), and diastereotopic β-CH2 (δH 1.73, 1.82) signals. The presence of
an additional oxymethine moiety (δH 5.34, δC 73.7) was consistent with a second hydroxy acid, as

22

proposed from MS2 data (C10H18O2). This was further supported by two incomplete COSY spin
systems suggesting a terminal methyl and α-hydroxy substituent. Finally, despite an overlapped
upfield region in the 1H NMR spectrum, correlations supporting an Ile residue could be delineated.
COSY spin systems incorporating a δ-CH3 triplet (δH 0.84, δC 10.9) correlated to diastereotopic γCH2 resonances (δH 1.29, 1.01, δC 26.1), and COSY-correlated NH (δH 7.48) and α-H (δH 3.67)
signals were both observed. While both Leu and Ile are present, their relative location within the
ring could not be determined without a high quality HMBC spectrum.
Relaxed substrate specificity of the NRPS adenylation domains [53–55] may be
responsible for structural microheterogeneity (Fig 7) and co-elution of closely related metabolites.
Microheterogeneity is supported by the large number of isobaric MS features in the molecular
network: specifically, there are seven nodes for m/z 777.48 ± 0.03 with retention times between
7.7 and 8.0 min.

Correlation of select metabolites with microbialite bacteria.
Given the variation in microbial community and metabolites between flag stations in the
Schoenmakerskop barrage pool, we calculated (nonparametric) Spearman rank correlations
between abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA OTUs and MS features (Fig 8) to identify groups of
organisms associated with specific metabolites, whether positively or negatively correlated. These
correlations in abundance may indicate producer or utilizer bacteria of specific metabolite families.
It is also noteworthy that a fungal producer or utilizer of the targeted metabolites cannot be
discounted in the absence of fungal ITS sequencing.
The ibhayipeptolide molecular family (e.g., MS features 2198, 880, and 2363) were
significantly positively correlated with Geitlerinema_PCC-9228 (Cyanobacteria, OTU290),

(Bacteroidota, OTU302) and Chitinophagales (Bacteroidota, OTU25), while they were negatively
correlated with Phormidesmis_ANT.L52.6 and Chamaesiphon_PCC-7430 (Cyanobacteria, OTUs
56 & 62 respectively), Anaerolineae A4b (Chloroflexota, OTU538), and Flavobacteriaceae
(Bacteroidota, OTU92). It is noteworthy that none of these bacterial OTUs were dominant
community members that could be expected to influence gross stromatolite morphology and there
was no distinct stromatolite morphology associated with the highest abundance of depsipeptolides
at flag stations 4-7. Interestingly, the fatty alcohol molecular family (e.g., MS features 49 and 50)
also displayed significant but inverse correlations with some of the same organisms (Fig 8).
Cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and fungi are all known to produce nonribosomal
depsipeptides, comprising diverse amino and hydroxy acid residues, that exhibit a variety of
biological properties. Many of these metabolites with alternating peptide and ester bonds comprise
repeating depsipeptide oligomers. Cyclic hexadepsipeptides from cyanobacteria include
antanapeptins [56], which like ibhayipeptolides consist of one short and one longer chain hydroxy
acids, separated by a dipeptide. Unlike ibhayipeptolides, the antanapeptins and a variety of other
cyanobacterial depsipeptides contain branched β-hydroxy acids [56–60]. There are many examples
of branched longer chain hydroxy acids in the extensive set of known cyanobacterial cyclic
depsipeptides and it is notable that the linear long chain α-hydroxy acid in the ibhayipeptolide
structural motif appears unusual for a cyanobacterial metabolite [61,62]. Cyclic hexadepsipeptides
containing long chain hydroxy acids from heterotrophic bacteria include the icosalides produced
by Burkholderia species from diverse habitats [63]. A relevant group of pentadepsipeptides
derived from both cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria constitutes the unnarmicins [64,65]
and solonamides [66], which comprise a general structural motif of one β-hydroxy acid cyclized

with a tetrapeptide sequence of alternately repeating amino acids. Derived from a marine
Photobacterium (Gammaproteobacteria), unnarmicins A and C possess β-hydroxy-octanoyl and hexanoyl units, respectively, preceding a Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe sequence. In contrast, unnarmicin D
was isolated from a marine Trichodesmium cyanobacterium and comprises a β-hydroxydodecanoyl moiety cyclized with a Gly-Tyr-Gly-Phe tetrapeptide. Solonamides A and B were also
isolated from a marine Photobacterium and possess β-hydroxy-hexanoyl and -octanoyl units,
respectively, preceding a Phe-Leu-Ala-Leu sequence. The solonamides have been investigated as
biofilm inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus given their inhibition of the accessory gene regulator
(agr) quorum sensing system [66–69]. Cyclic depsipeptides reported from fungi mostly contain
one or multiple relatively short and branched chain α-hydroxy acids, and hexadepsipeptides are
the largest subgroup of this class [70,71]. A notable octadepsipeptide exception is verticilide,
which is a cyclotetramer of the dipeptidol 2R-hydroxyheptanoic acid–N-methyl-L-Ala [72].

Conclusion
The Schoenmakerskop microbialite system comprises mature microbialite formations with
an abundance of superficial cyanobacteria as indicated by the diverse mosaic of bacterial taxa
reported previously [24,41] and detected here (Figs 2, S14, S15). We found that metabolites and
microorganisms differ between core samples of microbialites submerged in the pool throughout
the tidal cycle compared to surface microbialites exposed to flowing water or air between tides.
The different chemical profiles observed between submerged and surface exposed core samples
could be due to variation in UV exposure [73,74], oxidation, predator grazing, and or age and
microbial composition of the microbialite accretions. The new ibhayipeptolide family of cyclic
depsipeptides was most abundant in substrate cores of submerged microbialites, and correlated
positively with cyanobacterial (OTUs 290, 42) and bacteroidete (OTUs 302, 25) taxa. This spatial
survey of a mature stromatolite bed guided prioritization of substrate cores for future deep
metagenomic sequencing, which is anticipated to reveal the ibhayipeptolide-producing organism,
as well as biosynthetic templates for these and other MS features detected in low abundance and
assigned to putative structural classes. Importantly, deep metagenomic sequencing may provide
knowledge of the metabolic functional guilds of known and new organisms in the complex mosaic

of microbialite communities and facilitate hypotheses for future studies on the role of chemical
signaling in microbialite formation and maintenance. Given the microgram quantities of
ibhayipeptolides and other more minor metabolites isolated by HPLC, investigation of their
biological function awaits the ongoing chemical syntheses of representative structures.

Study site description
The Schoenmakerskop site (34°2’29” S 25°32’21” E; Fig S1) is located adjacent to the
metropole of Gqerberha (previously Port Elizabeth), close to human settlements and is exposed to
moderate anthropogenic influences on ambient water chemistry [75]. Microbialite formations at
this site begin from the freshwater inflow in the supratidal zone (Fig 1A). Freshwater from seeps
feed through a short region of fluvial microbialites (Fig 1A, stations 1 and 4) and then into a
barrage pool (Fig 1A, stations 2, 3, 5 and 6) separated from the subtidal zone by a microbialite
plateau (Fig 1A, stations 7, 8 and 10). The formations are relatively flat, forming a shallow pool
(mean depth 0.35 +/- 0.06 m) and the difference in elevation between the inflow formations and
the plateau formations is ~1 m vertically, stretching over a horizontal distance of ~15 m. The flag
stations range from ~3-5 m apart.

Sample collection
Prior to field sampling, collection permits (RES2018/44; RES2021/81) were acquired from
the South African Department Environmental Affairs (DEA) and the South African Department
of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DFFE). The study site at Schoenmakerskop is public
property and no protected species were sampled for this study. Microbialite substrate cores (Fig
S3) were collected from nine flagged stations (1-8 and 10, Figs 1A, 1B, and S4-S12) in

Schoenmakerskop barrage pool in the Eastern Cape of South Africa (Figs S1 and S2) at low tide
across two days (November 9 and 10, 2018; Permit No RES2018/44). Twelve substrate cores were
collected from each of the flag stations 1-7, while 18 cores were collected from flag station 8, and
14 cores were collected from flag station 10, for a total of 116 core samples. In each case a custommade one-inch diameter, hollow metal corer was hammered into the substrate to a depth of about
5 inches with a mallet to provide cores at three different positions along the water flowpath (upper,
middle, lower), to the left and right of each marker flag (Fig S3). On each day, at least six cores
were obtained per flag station (Figs S4-S12). Additional cores were collected from stations 8 and
10 given their position at the edge of the seaward barrage wall. As cores were obtained, they were
subsampled for separate chemical and DNA extractions. Subsamples for chemical extraction were
placed in 20 mL glass vials on ice immediately in the field and frozen at -20 ℃ within two hours
of collection. Subsamples for DNA extraction were placed in Falcon tubes containing RNALater
and flash-frozen in the field, then stored at –20 °C within two hours of collection. Two sea water
samples were also collected from an adjacent beach access (assigned as station 9), as
environmental controls for this study.
Two larger microbialite substrate samples for isolation and planar structure elucidation of
metabolites were collected from flag station 7 in March 2021 (Permit No: RES2021/81), wrapped
in aluminum foil and stored on ice immediately in the field until freezing at –20 °C for subsequent
chemical extraction.

reaction was prepared with 15-20 ng gDNA template, 10 μM of each primer, 5X PCR buffer
(containing MgCl2), 10 μM DNTP’s, 0.5 units KAPA HIFI Hotstart DNA polymerase (cat no.

cycling parameters employed were as follows; initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by
amplification with 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 1 min and additional
amplification with 18 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a

and PCR kit (cat. no. BIO-52059). Samples were sequenced on an Illumina Miseq platform,
generating ~250 nt amplicon libraries (only forward reads were determined to be of a high enough

Chemical extraction and tandem mass spectrometry of microbialite core

Microbialite core samples were lyophilized at Rhodes University in South Africa in
November/December 2018 and shipped to UC San Diego in January (received 01/2019). Of 116
vials containing core samples for the spatial survey, six vials were broken during shipping and
were discarded. Approximately 1 cm3 (0.2 g) of each sample was placed in a scintillation vial and

5 mL 100% MeOH were added, including an empty vial as a control. The vials were left to stand
for 1-2 h at room temperature before being placed at 4 °C overnight. Aliquots of these methanol
extracts (160 µL) were transferred to vials, and dried in vacuo for weighing. The range of extract
weights was estimated by selecting forty representative samples, from all flag stations, judged by
their color and apparent mass as low, medium and high mass. Aliquots (160 µL) of each MeOH
extract were added to 96-well plates (Thermo 0.5 mL, U-bottom, PP). Controls included
background seawater from a remote non-stromatolite site (#9), and methanol solvent and glass
scintillation vial. The plates were dried in vacuo using a vacuum centrifuge (Centrivap, Labconco)
and resuspended in 200 µL 9:1 MeOH/H2O per well. LC–MS2 analysis of the 2018 core sample
collection was performed as described previously [76]. In short, 10 µL of each sample were
injected into a Vanquish UHPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive quadrupole orbitrap mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For the chromatographic separation,
a reversed phase C18 porous core column (Kinetex C18, 150 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm particle size, 100
Å pore size, Phenomenex, Torrance, USA) was used. For gradient elution a high-pressure binary
gradient system was used. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A H2O + 0.1 % formic acid (FA)
and solvent B acetonitrile (ACN) + 0.1 % FA, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. After injection,
the samples were eluted with a linear gradient from 0-1 min at 5 % B, 1-4 min 5-60 % B, 4-10 min
60-99 % B, followed by a 3 min washout phase at 99% B and a 2 min re-equilibration phase at 5
% B. Data dependent acquisition (DDA) of MS2 spectra was performed in positive mode.
Electrospray ionization (ESI) parameters were set to 52 AU sheath gas flow, 14 AU auxiliary gas
flow, 0 AU sweep gas flow and 400 °C auxiliary gas temperature. The spray voltage was set to 3.5
kV and the inlet capillary to 320 °C. 50 V S-lens level was applied. MS scan range was set to m/z
150-1500 with a resolution at m/z 200 (Rm/z 200) of 17,500 with one micro-scan. The maximum ion

injection time was set to 100 ms with automated gain control (AGC) target of 5E5. Up to 5 MS2
spectra per MS1 survey scan were recorded in DDA mode with Rm/z 200 of 17,500 with one microscan. The maximum ion injection time for MS2 scans was set to 100 ms with a AGC target of 5E5
ions. The MS2 precursor isolation window was set to m/z 1. Normalized collision energy was set
to a stepwise increase from 20 to 30 to 40 % with z = 1 as default charge state. MS2 scans were
triggered at the apex of chromatographic peaks within 2 to 15 s from their first occurrence.
Dynamic precursor exclusion was set to 5 s. Ions with unassigned charge states were excluded
from MS2 acquisition as well as isotope peaks.
For MS2 data analysis, raw spectra were converted to .mzXML files using MSconvert
(ProteoWizard). MS1 and MS2 feature extraction was performed using MZmine2.37, an IIN
enabled version. The parameters used in MZmine2 are listed in Table S3. The MS feature table
.csv and .mgf files were exported and uploaded to GNPS (gnps.ucsd.edu) for feature-based
molecular networking (FBMN). For spectrum library matching and spectral networking the
minimum cosine score to define spectral similarity was set to 0.7. The precursor and fragment ion
mass tolerances were set to 0.01 Da, minimum matched fragment ions to 6 and minimum cluster
size to 1 (MS cluster off). Molecular networks were visualized with Cytoscape 3.7.2 [77] and node
information was enriched with the MS1 peak areas from the MS feature table. The link to the GNPS

Amplicon reads were curated using Mothur [78]. Reads with a quality window average
below 20, length shorter than 250 bases or greater than 500 bases, any ambiguous bases, or
homopolymeric runs greater than 7, were removed from the dataset. Chimeric sequences were
identified using VSEARCH and were removed from the dataset. The remaining reads were
classified against the SILVA database (v138.1) and all reads classified as Chloroplasts,
Mitochondria, Unknown, Archaea or Eukaryota were removed. Sequences were aligned and all
that did not fit into the region into which 95% of all sequences were aligned were removed. Aligned
sequences were checked again for chimeric sequences which were removed upon identification.
Singletons were removed to reduce computational expense. While some believe that this may bias
the analysis in terms of removing spurious sequences [79], there is evidence to suggest that even
when extremely rare species are the focus of research, removal of singletons aids in chimera
removal, and increases accuracy of alpha and beta diversity while decreasing computational
requirements [80]. Sequences were once again filtered to remove any reads classified as
Chloroplasts, Mitochondria, Unknown, Archaea or Eukaryota as anecdotal experience has shown
that some contaminants, primarily “unknowns”, are still present at this stage and a second sweep
is required to thoroughly clean up the dataset. The remaining sequences were clustered into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a distance of 0.03 and counted per sample. Representative
sequences for each OTU were similarly extracted and classified against the SILVA database
(V138.1). OTU counts per sample were converted to relative abundance and used to generate nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots in R using the vegan, plotly, and ggplot packages.
Associated pairwise Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) scores were calculated for the different
groups of samples (e.g., samples that were submerged or exposed to flowing water) using the
vegan package in R. Canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) of bacterial OTUs was performed on

Relative abundance plots of bacterial OTUs in the stromatolite core samples (Figs 2, S14,
S15) were generated using ggplot2 v3.4.4 in R [83]. Phylogeny of the conserved OTUs in
Schoenmakerskop, relative to reference sequences and conserved OTUs from a previous study,
was inferred using maximum likelihood (Fig 3). Briefly, conserved OTU sequences from this
study and a previous study were aligned against the NR database using NCBI BLASTn [84,85] to
find reference sequences. A spirochete sequence was chosen as an outgroup. All sequences were
aligned using muscle (v 5.1) [86]. The alignment was then used to build a phylogenetic tree in
MEGA 11 [87], using the Maximum Likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The
Tamura-Nei model was used, with uniform rates amongst sites where all sites were used. The
initial tree was generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and the Nearest-NeighborInterchange was used for the heuristic method. The bootstrapped tree was visualized in iTol [88]
and re-rooted at the outgroup.

LC–MS2 data preparation for analysis
The LC–MS2 data table was exported from MZmine2 and was further processed in the
statistical software R (version 4.1.2) using modified code from a previously published analysis
[89]. This table was blank-subtracted with a cutoff of 0.3 (i.e., MS features with a ratio of mean
intensity in blanks vs mean intensity of MS features less than 30% were considered background
noise and removed). After blank subtraction, the data were normalized by total ion count. The
blank subtracted, normalized data were used for subsequent analysis in QIIME2.

Subsequent visualization and statistical analysis of LC–MS2 data (Fig 1) was performed in
QIIME2 (Bolyen et al. 2019). Unsupervised principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed
using the Bray-Curtis distance and the qiime beta and diversity pcoa plugin. PERMANOVA
analysis was performed to quantify the significance of separation. All code is provided in the
accompanying Zenodo repository (see Data Availability).

Spearman rank correlation analysis of MS features and 16S rRNA sequence
data
The tables of MS feature abundances and bacterial OTU counts were used to generate a
correlation analysis visualized as a heatmap (Fig 8). Prior to correlation, MS features observed in
less than 10% of samples were removed. Amplicon sequencing data was transformed to
proportions by dividing the counts for each sample by the total sequencing depth of the sample.
Both datasets were mean centered and scaled, and combined in a single input file. Spearman rank
correlations were calculated between each pair (microbe~metabolite) of MS features using R
package “Hmisc”. P values were adjusted according to the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control
the false discovery rate (FDR). FDR < 0.05 was considered significant. This linear statistical
correlation analysis method was chosen over newer neural networking covariance methods due to
the benchmarking performed by Quinn and Erb [90]. All code is provided in the accompanying
Zenodo repository (see Data Availability).

Compound class prediction using SIRIUS and CANOPUS
Molecular formulas were assigned using the SIRIUS GUI. MzMine2 was used to generate
and export an .mgf file specific for SIRIUS4 analysis of the 2018 core sample set. For individual
analysis of the four major ibhayipeptolide depsipeptides, HRMS and MS2 (20, 40 and 60 eV)

spectra of both [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ ([M-H]- was also included for MS feature 2198) were
manually uploaded as csv files to SIRIUS5. SIRIUS, CSI:FingerID, and CANOPUS analyses were
performed with the parameters listed in Table S4 and S5.

Compound isolation and structure elucidation
General experimental procedures
NMR data were acquired on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a
5 mm TCI cryoprobe, with the residual solvent used as an internal standard (CDCl3, δH 7.26, δC
77.16 ppm). High resolution (HR)TOFMS (ESI+) and tandem MS data were recorded on an
Agilent 1260 infinity II LC coupled to a 6545 QToF MS. The mobile phase consisted of ultra-pure
H2O (A) and ACN (B) with 0.1 % formic acid. A gradient method from 15 % B to 90 % B in 9
min at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min was used. The column (Phenomenex Kinetex C18, 2.6 μm, 100
Å, 50 mm x 2.1 mm) was re-equilibrated before each injection and the column compartment was
maintained at 40 ˚C throughout each run. Semi-preparative HPLC (Phenomenex Kinetex C18, 5
μm, 100 Å, 250 mm x 10 mm) utilized isocratic elution conditions or a gradient system with a flow
rate of 4 mL/min on a Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC system operating at room temperature, equipped
with an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector. All samples were filtered through a 0.2 μm nylon
filter or centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min before LC–MS and HPLC analysis. General reagents
were from VWR International.

Two larger samples collected in March 2021 from flag station 7 for characterization of pure
depsipeptides were deep frozen before lyophilization for 48 h and each processed separately
according to the following general protocol for separate LC–MS profiling in case they varied in
chemistry. The dry biomass (1.91 kg total for both samples) was crushed by mortar and pestle into
pieces smaller than 0.5 cm. The resulting powdered biomass was extracted twice in DCM-MeOH
(2:1) by soaking for 48 h at room temperature in the dark and without agitation. Approximately
2.8 L of solvent was used per kg of dry biomass. After each extraction, the supernatant was filtered
through filter paper and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford two organic extracts (4.13
g total).
Each organic extract was initially fractionated into 10 fractions (A-G) by normal phase
chromatography on a Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash Rf 200 system using a RediSep column (silica
40 g Gold). The mobile phase gradient used was 100% hexanes to 100% EtOAc over 23 min,
holding at 100% EtOAc for 3.0 min, then ramping to 75% EtOAc-MeOH over 7 min and holding
for 5 min. Due to the largest amount of ibhayipeptolide A present, fraction B (7-15 min) was split
into 5 subfractions (B1-B5) using RP18 chromatography on the same Combiflash system. A
RediSep column (30 g HP C18) was used with a gradient of MeOH-H2O (50% for 2 min before
ramping to 100% MeOH over 5 min and holding for 9 min). Ibhayipeptolides A and B (MS features
2198 and 8186) were in highest abundance in subfraction B3 (4-8 min). Ibhayipeptolides A (tR 9.1
min) and B (tR 8.0 min) were isolated by semi-preparative HPLC (Kinetex C18 250x10 mm) from
subfraction B3 utilizing a shallow gradient (90% ACN to 100% ACN over 17 min).
Ibhayipeptolides A (80% ACN, Kinetex C18 100x4.6 mm, 8.6-9.5 min) and B (80% ACN, Kinetex
C18 250x10 mm, 17.1-17.7 min) were purified further using isocratic HPLC conditions. Less than
100 μg of each depsipeptide were isolated.
