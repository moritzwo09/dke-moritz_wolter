Origin of Life research is a fast growing field of study with each year bringing new

3

breakthroughs. Recent discoveries include novel syntheses of life’s building blocks,

4

mechanisms of activation and interaction between molecules, and newly identified en-

5

vironments that provide promising conditions for these syntheses and mechanisms.

6

Even with these new findings, firmly grounded in rigorous laboratory experiments, re-

7

searchers often find themselves uncertain about how to apply them. How can a bridge

8

be built between the laboratory and the geochemical environment? A critical question

9

to ask when seeking to apply new results in origins is: how can this chemistry occur

10

without direct intervention from a chemist? We believe the first step towards answer-

11

ing this question lies in the determination of rate constants and the construction of

12

chemical networks to describe prebiotic chemistry in geochemical environments.

13

So far, our group has measured several rate constants relevant to different prebiotic

14

reaction networks, starting with the synthetic pathways of the cyanosulfidic network.

The reactions we explore often involve ultraviolet light-driven photochemistry, facili-

16

tated by our StarLab setup that accurately simulates the spectrum of the young Sun

17

and other stars. Our latest work investigates environments with active photochemistry

18

in the absence of cyanide. In this study, we measure the effective rate constant for

19

the production of formate from the reduction of carbon species using sulfite within the

20

context of early Martian waters. The underlying goal of the work done in our group is

21

to predict the likelihood that certain geological conditions will result in a specific set

22

of chemical products. These predictions can be combined with those we have made for

23

the necessary astrophysical conditions in certain origins of life scenarios on extrasolar

24

planets.

25

In the near future we expect that a sufficient number of rate constants will be

26

measured, by our group and others, to allow for aspects of prebiotic chemistry to be

27

predicted using chemical kinetics models. Once these models have been benchmarked

28

against experimental data, our next step will be applying them to natural environments

29

that better mimic the conditions thought to have been present at the onset of life.

30

Following this, we can test these models by comparing their predictions to additional

31

experiments. After refinement, these models will be able to provide guidance on the

32

optimal conditions for conducting laboratory experiments, whilst helping to minimise

33

and characterise any interference from a chemist.

34

35

36

This approach can provide valuable insights into what is possible within geochemical
environments, where all chemistry is by necessity do-nothing chemistry.

Introduction

58

The origin of life is arguably one of the greatest open problems in science and, as such, has

59

gained a lot of traction as a formidable yet promising area of research. The motivation behind

60

this surge in popularity is driven by recent technological advancements and new laboratory

61

techniques that are allowing scientists to explore the intricate molecular processes and diverse

62

environments proposed to be involved in life’s emergence. 5,6 In addition, progress in space

63

exploration has presented the opportunity to investigate the possibility of life beyond Earth,

64

providing a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions that might influence the

65

emergence of life. 7 Despite recent advances in framing the question of life’s origins 8 and the

66

rapid progress in understanding the nature of prebiotic chemistry, 9 it is difficult to assess

67

whether we are any closer to answering the fundamental question of how life can emerge

68

from non-living matter. 10–12

69

The question of how life began now demands a broader interdisciplinary perspective, 13,14

70

making the lack of cohesion between disciplines a major barrier to advancing research within

71

this field. 13 Given the dearth of data and inherent uncertainties that presently inundate

72

this work, new and old ideas, from a variety of different fields, should be considered with

73

epistemic humility, an awareness of the limits of our knowledge. 15 Adopting this stance will

74

pave the way for exploring new, solvable, questions and avenues of inquiry.

75

To maximise the chance of discovering one or more scenarios that may lead to life’s

76

origins, we propose that the community should focus especially on those scenarios that show

77

the greatest empirical support. These scenarios in particular should be the most intensely

78

tested and challenged, 14 in order to identify and explicate experimentally and observationally

79

grounded candidate solutions to the problem of life’s origins.

80

This approach often begins by identifying what is inevitable in a planetary environment,

81

or, to borrow the phrase of Benner, what “can’t not happen”. 16 It can also start by con-

82

sidering what is impossible in a planetary environment, what “can’t happen.” 17 However,

83

between what is necessary and what is impossible, there exists what is possible yet not

84

guaranteed. 18,19

85

Often discussions of possibility can become conflated with plausibility. Prebiotic plausi-

86

bility is typically applied to the chemical and physical boundary conditions of a proposed

87

environment for prebiotic chemistry. 20–23 Beyond boundary conditions, a complete account

88

of prebiotic plausibility must consider the likelihood of reactions occurring in sequence un-

89

der environmental conditions. 21 We propose that these probabilities can be summarised as

90

the translation of a chemical sequence from the laboratory to a natural environment. 19 We

91

further propose that these probabilities can be quantitatively estimated using kinetics.

92

This is the logic behind the work our lab is focused on. We begin by taking known pre-

93

biotic scenarios that have proven successful in the lab and identifying natural environments

94

in which these scenarios could occur. We then test these reactions under prebiotically plau-

95

sible conditions either with no interference from a chemist or with the interference of the

96

chemist minimised and carefully accounted for. We term this approach do-nothing prebiotic

97

chemistry.

98

Our account starts by defining do-nothing chemistry and explaining what this method-

99

ological approach has to do with the origin of life. We will introduce the analogy between

100

do-nothing farming and do-nothing prebiotic chemistry and discuss how this do-nothing pre-

101

biotic chemistry approach can be implemented. In light of this we outline the work our lab

102

is currently focused on in this regard, and set out goals for future work and collaborations.

103

Do-Nothing Farming and Do-Nothing Prebiotic Chem-

104

istry

105

There is a fruitful analogy between synthetic chemistry and farming. In order to farm

106

successfully, farmers are required to grow crops at high yields which requires fertile soil

107

and careful cultivation. In a similar way, the synthetic chemist can selectively produce a

108

particular chemical at high yield under certain carefully cultivated conditions. For multi-

109

step syntheses, each individual reaction needs to produce the desired product at high yield.

110

This product may then require isolation before proceeding with the next step in the reaction

111

sequence. Synthetic chemists who do not carry out total synthesis in this manner may

112

encounter challenges posed by what is often referred to as the arithmetic demon. 24 This is

113

the idea that, if a reaction takes place over many steps, and the production rate for desired

114

products is smaller than the rate for the competing reactions, the concentration of the desired

115

products will drop exponentially. This idea has previously been used to place constraints on

116

the geochemical environments where a specific prebiotic scenario is feasible. 1

117

A reaction with many products, all with similar production rates, can lead to an increase

118

in the chemical diversity of the system with the potential for millions of molecules to all

119

interact in a single environment. 25 This is a situation some prebiotic chemists describe as

120

chemical “mess” 13,26,27 or “clutter”. 28 This high chemical diversity can make it extremely dif-

121

ficult to detect and quantify compounds. 28 As chemical diversity increases, so does chemical

122

complexity, which we define as the number of reactions occurring in the system. Eventually,

123

the chances of two specific molecules meeting to produce a desired intermediate become very

124

low compared to the likelihood of them reacting with other components in the system. In

125

this regime, productive chemistry becomes statistically impossible without either an order-

126

ing mechanism or the concentrating conditions found in prebiotically promising geochemical

127

environments.

128

An illustration of the arithmetic demon is given in Figure 1. This figure shows the reaction

129

yields over a sequence of 30 reactions, and uses those yields to calculate the concentrations

130

of the desired products at the end of a sequence of chemical reactions. To give some context

131

to these numbers, we divide the range of concentrations into five labeled segments each

132

spanning multiple orders of magnitude. The labels are meant to generally apply to this

133

approximate range, and therefore exceptions to these labels may be found in the literature.

134

The first label is “most prebiotic experiments”, indicating that prebiotic experiments that

135

form the monomeric building blocks of life or their precursors tend to have products at

136

concentrations of ≳ 10−3 mol/L (see Walton et al. 23 and references therein). The limits

137

for the products of a multi-step synthesis to participate in subsequent reactions are around

138

≳ 10−6 mol/L. 23 Most detection techniques will not operate reliably for concentrations below

139

10−9 mol/L 29 meaning that most current or near-future prebiotic investigations will not be

140

able to empirically test scenarios that involve concentrations much lower than this. Instead,

141

non-standard approaches, involving theoretical models or novel analytical techniques, will

142

be required. There will be some concentration, not yet precisely determined, below which

143

prebiotic synthesis is statistically impossible regardless of the yield.

144

Returning to the farming analogy, prebiotic synthetic chemists are those who seek to

145

farm in uncultivated soil. At times, the task may seem daunting, akin to trying to grow

146

crops in soil that has never been tended. However, one of the principles of do-nothing

147

farming is that even uncultivated soil is still regulated by nature and can turn out to be

148

more fertile than the farmer often imagines. Here the prebiotic chemist’s soil is liquid

149

water. Liquid water is a very challenging solvent for organic chemistry due to its tendency

150

to break down many prebiotically relevant compounds, 30 including the precursors to the

151

monomeric building blocks, such as hydrogen cyanide, other nitriles, and aldehydes. Many

152

of these hydrolysis reactions are effectively irreversible. 31 Water also poses a challenge for

153

polymerization reactions involving these building blocks, as they require dehydration, a

154

process that is thermodynamically disfavored in water. 32 These challenges underscore why

155

numerous prebiotic syntheses focus on eliminating water through techniques like freezing 33

156

and drying. 34

157

In almost every other domain of synthetic chemistry the problematic nature of water

158

would not pose an issue as any efficient method to get from reactant to product is allowed.

159

In synthetic chemistry there is a clear goal, and artificial intervention, if effective, is welcome.

160

However, in prebiotic chemistry, this is not the case, as the chemistry that could have

161

occurred on ancient Earth must have been possible without the presence of a chemist. This

162

is a regime where there remains a goal, life from non-life, but where intervention to achieve

163

such a goal for its own sake is implausible. At first glance, this situation is hard to imagine

164

playing out in any way that does not lead to almost certain failure. 35

165

It is here that we find inspiration from the Japanese farmer Masanobu Fukuoka. Fukuoka

166

proposed a different approach to farming, which he called do-nothing farming. 36 Fukuoka

167

suggested first identifying what crops will grow best in what environments; second, finding

168

ways to remove intervention from the farmer wherever possible; and third, identifying only

169

those minimal interventions that cooperate with the natural course of the environment.

170

Regardless of the effectiveness of do-nothing farming in agriculture, 37 the virtues of do-

171

nothing prebiotic chemistry are clear. An approach that identifies natural environments

172

in which a certain chemical sequence is likely to produce good yields, tests these reactions

173

within such environments, 23 and minimises contingency, 19 offers a straightforward method

174

to remove the chemist. In essence, this approach serves as a bridge between laboratory

175

experiments and sequences of events in geochemical environments whilst also estimating the

176

likelihood of these events occurring in a specific order.

177

Aspects of this do-nothing approach have already been applied to prebiotic chemistry 14

178

and have found surprising success. In fact, there are several instances where reduced control

179

over the experimental setup, coupled with broader mimicking of “messier” geochemical con-

180

ditions, has resulted in more successful chemistry, yielding the desired products or exhibiting

181

the desired behaviour. The use of initial chemical conditions informed by the geochemistry

182

of a specific environment has resulted in chemical syntheses with higher yields and better

183

selectivity. Notable examples include chemical pathways involving both sulfite 38–40 and fer-

184

rocyanide. 39,41,42 The integration of common mineral compositions and surface properties

185

has led to new discoveries, such as the catalytic synthesis of amino acids from Krebs cycle

186

intermediates, 43 and the formation of enantiomerically pure RNA precursors from racemic

187

mixtures. 44 Mineral surfaces have also proven to be better templates for RNA polymerisation

188

when compared to artificial surfaces. 45 Moreover, wet-dry cycles that do not completely dry,

189

such as would occur at water-rock interfaces, turn out to be far more productive. 46 Addition-

190

ally, ultraviolet (UV) light can act to “tidy” the chemistry by selecting for nucleotides that

191

are photostable and can be photochemically repaired; these turn out to be the nucleotides life

192

uses. 47–49 In addition, models suggest that phase equilibrium between gas-phase carbon and

193

graphite can also simplify and order magma chemistry such that it looks astonishingly like

194

laboratory reactant mixtures for prebiotic chemistry experiments. 50 Based on these findings,

195

it seems that in the right settings nature is far better at prebiotic chemistry than the trained

196

organic chemist.

197

Implementing the Do-Nothing Approach

198

Implementing the do-nothing approach involves identifying the most productive geochemical

199

settings for prebiotic chemistry and determining what changes must still be imposed in order

200

to mimic the unpredictable yet crucial natural events required for the emergence of life.

201

The first step when exploring any new chemical reaction is to determine the conditions

202

required for the reaction to work. The next step is to figure out what products are formed and

203

in what quantities. Based on this information we can make an estimate of the reaction yield

204

and begin to ascertain if this is a steady-state yield, or whether it would change further if the

205

reaction were given more time to progress. For some applications, this extent of investigation,

206

along with some work-up strategy, would be sufficient. For prebiotic chemistry, however, we

207

want to translate the laboratory results to a natural environment.

208

The simplest and often first approach to applying laboratory results to natural environ-

209

ments is to measure reaction timescales. Here we define a timescale as the time taken for

210

a given reaction sequence to build up steady state concentrations of desired products at a

211

specified yield. Timescales measured in the lab will be determined by the physical condi-

212

tions of the experiment. However, when applied to natural environments, the timescales will

213

need to be adjusted to account for the specific conditions in the geochemical environment of

214

interest. This is the approach taken by Rimmer et al. for UV-driven photochemistry. 1,2 The

215

utility of this approach is that it enables us to predict how a sequence of chemical reactions

216

will play out in a natural environment. However, it is essential to acknowledge that these

217

timescales will not exhibit straightforward relationships if the chemistry in the system is

218

complex.

219

To translate these timescales from lab to environment, it is necessary to measure rate

220

constants. These constants represent the capacity for a chemical species to react at a given

221

rate.

222

For a reaction
aA + bB → cC + dD

223

We can write out the rate equation for the concentration of C, [C], as:
d[C]
= k[A]α [B]β
dt

224

where k refers to the rate constant for the reaction, t is time, and α and β represent the

225

order of reaction with respect to A and B. Given this representation, the experimental

226

measurement of different species’ timescales can be related to the reaction rate. By varying

227

the concentrations of these species we can reveal both the rate constant for this reaction and

228

the order of reaction with respect to each reactant. The rate constant for a reaction is always

229

context-dependent and can depend on factors such as temperature, pH, buffering capacity,

10

230

and the flux of UV light. For example, Rimmer et al. 1 measured the rate constant for the

231

bimolecular formation of the aminomethanedisulfonate adduct as a function of temperature.

232

When the context is broad, as is often the case for prebiotic chemistry, accurate measurement

233

of rate constants can be laborious. However, this work is essential if we are to properly

234

consider the environmental context for prebiotic chemistry.

235

To understand prebiotic chemistry in an environmental context, we will need to construct

236

reaction networks. These networks provide a chemical map or picture of the environment.

237

Systems prebiotic chemistry has already committed several years of very fruitful work to

238

discovering reactions and constructing networks. 51 In addition, the contrasting kinetic be-

239

haviours of living and non-living systems can offer insights into the step-wise transition from

240

non-life to life. 12 The measurement of rate constants has accompanied this endeavor for some

241

time, 31 but only recently has it gained significant momentum. 1,2,6,40–42 Rates and timescales

242

themselves are useful for evaluating prebiotic scenarios, 2 however, rate constants allow for

243

the application of models to assess the sensitivity of prebiotic scenarios to the environment.

244

Looking at reaction networks based on the kinetics of individual reactions allows us to

245

estimate the yield and selectivity of a given pathway (see Figure 2(A,B)). In complex systems

246

with many reactions occurring simultaneously, a subset of reactions that proceed significantly

247

faster than others will dominate the system. Even if some side reactions are faster than

248

those in the subset, the subset can still dominate if the reverse reactions are equally swift.

249

As long as this subset of reactions dominates, the system can be described by a simpler

250

network based on the subset. However, if the dominance changes, the network structure

251

may shift, with other reactions becoming more prominent and some fading away. This

252

underscores the necessity of using rate constants to identify the dominant reactions within

253

a given environment. Determining these reactions is especially important when considering

254

catalysis. A catalyst is a chemical species that increases the rate of a reaction without being

255

consumed. A catalytic reaction is a reaction in which a catalyst is present at a concentration

256

sufficient to measurably affect the rate. An autocatalytic reaction is a reaction where one of

the products can act as a catalyst.

258

Catalysts are often sought by prebiotic chemists as they can promote desirable reactions.

259

There are many examples of this in the literature; for instance, Kaur et al. 43 From the syn-

260

thetic chemistry perspective, catalysis helps enhance the yield and selectivity of a reaction.

261

From a systems chemistry perspective, catalysts selectively enhance specific pathways within

262

a network, thereby providing a degree of kinetic control. Autocatalytic reactions are of par-

263

ticular interest to the prebiotic chemist as they appear especially “life-like” in their behavior:

264

for example, the replication of a strand of DNA is characterised by an autocatalytic set of

265

reactions. 52

266

These autocatalytic reaction networks are prevalent in many important prebiotic syn-

267

theses. For example, the formose reaction, shown in Figure 2(C), involves the formation

268

of sugars, particularly aldose sugars like ribose, from the reaction of formaldehyde, or its

269

derivatives, with glycolaldehyde. 53 The formose reaction is described as autocatalytic due to

270

the regeneration of glycolaldehyde. 54

271

Although not fully understood it is thought that the reaction starts with the combination

272

of glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde, producing glyceraldehyde. After further reactions glyc-

273

eraldehyde then reacts with another molecule of formaldehyde producing compounds which

274

eventually break down into two molecules of glycolaldehyde. These glycolaldehyde molecules

275

can then re-enter the reaction. 55 Despite the promising nature of this reaction scheme, the

276

formose reaction is notoriously unstable, 20 and the autocatalytic potential of this network

277

can be difficult to manifest. The plausibility of this mechanism in a natural environment can

278

be assessed by modeling its kinetics. If the rate of reaction for the combination of formalde-

279

hyde with glycolaldehyde is much faster than the combination of formaldehyde with the

280

glyceraldehyde derivative, then the regeneration of glycolaldehyde would not be possible as

281

all of the formaldehyde in the system would be used up. In addition, if Cannizzaro reactions

282

are favored in an environment, the intermediates will all end up as alcohols and carboxylic

283

acids (see Figure 2(C)). By studying the kinetics involved in each step of this reaction we

284

can assess what reactions will dominate.

285

The formose reaction is just one example of an autocatalytic prebiotic reaction among

286

many. 51 Further research is necessary to ascertain the robustness of these autocatalytic reac-

287

tions in natural environments, and other catalytic chemistry, including systems that exhibit

288

mutual catalytic behavior, 56 where they must contend with degradation chemistry. How-

289

ever, we propose that future studies may reveal these reactions to align with our definition

290

of do-nothing prebiotic chemistry.

291

Applicability of Do-Nothing Prebiotic Chemistry

292

When assessing the applicability of this do-nothing approach it is important to consider

293

how we can effectively monitor our progress. Within origin of life research we focus on

294

looking at the viability of different prebiotic scenarios. This involves scrutinising various

295

combinations of proposed chemical pathways and environmental conditions. These scenarios

296

aim to account for the transition from our initial chemical conditions to some endpoint that

297

is, by some measure or judgement, closer to life as we know it.

298

There are many different ways this closeness to life, or “aliveness”, 12 could be char-

299

acterised, one of which is the level of self-control exhibited by an individualised chemical

300

system. In life as we know it, an important component of this self-control is kinetic control,

301

usually achieved through enzymes. 57 The greater the extent to which a chemical system ex-

302

erts control over itself and its immediate environment, the more we might consider it to have

303

greater aliveness. Thus, kinetic control seems to be a necessary condition for life, though it

304

is far from a sufficient condition.

305

Environments that structure the chemistry in such a way as to provide a measure of

306

kinetic stability or redundancy for that system– by providing stable fluxes of feedstock

307

molecules, naturally regulating rates so that the desired subset of reactions dominates, and

308

storing and then releasing key chemical intermediates– are the environments that seem most

309

apt to enable collections of molecules within them to self-organize. This serendipitous chemi-

15

310

cal ordering provided by the environment to the chemical system would only be coincidentally

311

aimed toward the preservation and propagation of that collection of molecules. However,

312

chemical systems directed toward survival and self-propagation will turn out to be the sys-

313

tems that have the greater chance of persisting.

314

We are not yet at a stage where we can fully identify the ideal combination of immediate

315

environment and chemical system, however, we can identify certain global properties that the

316

environment must possess for a specific prebiotic scenario. These include minimal ultraviolet

317

spectral irradiance at the surface of a given rocky planet.

318

Rimmer et al. 1 applied kinetics and timescales to predict where UV-driven cyanosulfidic

319

chemistry 58 (see Fig. 3) can take place. They investigated the production of simple sugars

320

from hydrogen cyanide and sulfite, and from glycolonitrile and sulfide. At each of these

321

steps, the chemistry can form inert adducts without UV light (dark chemistry) and precur-

322

sors to sugars in the presence of UV light (light chemistry). They were able to determine

323

a threshold UV spectral irradiance such that the light chemistry out-competes the dark

324

chemistry, meeting the requirements of high yield and selectivity (see Figure 1). They then

325

compared this threshold UV spectral irradiance to the UV spectral irradiance for various

326

stars, at distances from those stars where the total flux of the star is equivalent to the flux

327

received at the Earth from the Sun. This delineates an “Abiogenesis Zone” outside of which

328

the cyanosulfidic scenario cannot succeed, if using sulfite as the source for solvated electrons.

329

This zone is drawn out in Figure 4.

330

These conclusions were drawn from applying kinetics to derive timescales appropriate

331

for specific environments. Much more work has since been done to constrain the lifetimes

332

of key prebiotic species, such as sulfite, 40 ferrocyanide 41 and aminoazoles. 6 Alongside this,

333

work has been done to constrain the kinetics of ferrocyanide formation, 42 the pH-dependent

334

rate constants for the photochemical production of formate from carbon species, 4 and the

335

timescales for various chemical steps in the cyanosulfidic network. 2

336

Here we highlight three examples from our group, two of which are focused on exploring

UV-driven prebiotic chemistry. For this we use an irradiation system as can be seen in Figure

338

5. This comprises of three light sources including a Laser Driven Light Source (LDLS)

339

with a wavelength range from 200 − 800 nm that can be scaled to match the young Sun.

340

Alongside this we also have both a D2 and Xe Lamp which can irradiate the same sample

341

in combination, to reproduce broadband spectra of arbitrary shape, allowing us to simulate

342

the broadband spectral irradiance, above 200 nm, of any star.

The first example relied on an earlier iteration of the irradiation setup to examine seven

344

different reactions that comprise the cyanosulfidic network. These included the oxidation of

345

phosphate, photodetachment of a hydroxide ion, reduction of cyanide via photodetachment

346

of electrons from sulfite, photoanomerization of α-thiocytidine, photoreduction of thioanhy20

347

droadenosine and thioanhydrouridine, and nitroprusside synthesis from nitrite or nitrate in

348

the presence of ultraviolet light.

349

The exploration of sulfite and iron photoredox chemistry cast our attention to Venus,

350

where both iron and sulfur are present in abundance. We worked with the Tosca Lab

351

in order to explore the production, lifetime, and ultraviolet absorbance properties of iron-

352

sulfur minerals in the clouds of Venus, and discovered that one particular iron-sulfur mineral,

353

predicted to be kinetically stable through the upper cloud layer, is a candidate for the

354

unknown ultraviolet absorber observed in the clouds of Venus. 3

355

More recently, we used an updated version of StarLab, as shown in Figure 5, to link

356

the carboxysulfitic prebiotic reaction network, first proposed by Liu et al., 59 to specific

357

geochemical environments. In this study, we determined the rate law for carbon reduction

358

using solvated electrons, which are produced through electron photodetachment from sulfite,

359

and measured the corresponding rate constants as a function of pH. Based on the observed

360

rate of formate production, we suggested that this chemistry is most compatible with mildly

361

alkaline aqueous environments exposed to UV radiation and in proximity to sources of both

362

SO2 and CO2 . Following kinetic calculations, we then determined approximate timescales

363

for this chemistry on both the Archean Earth and early Mars. 4

364

The three examples outlined here represent the first of many studies that will all have

365

the goal of bridging the gap between experiments performed in the laboratory and the

366

geochemical environment.

367

The Future of Do-Nothing Prebiotic Chemistry

368

The goal of our lab is to find out the circumstances under which prebiotic chemistry can take

369

place without a chemist. To do this we will need to construct prebiotic reaction networks and

370

determine the kinetics encompassing the behaviour of these chemical maps. A high fidelity

371

picture of multiple prebiotic scenarios, at the level of chemical kinetics, will not be a task for a

21
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qnl9v ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7180-081X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

372

single group. Presently, we are constructing this picture, an aqueous photochemical kinetics

373

model for prebiotic scenarios, in close collaboration with a small handful of others, however,

374

such a monumental task will require the efforts of a community of dedicated scientists.

375

We suggest that integrating various chemical networks, including measured rate con-

376

stants, within and outside our group, into this kinetics model, will facilitate the connection

377

of ideas from numerous studies, thereby allowing a more comprehensive picture to emerge.

378

As these models are slowly being constructed, it will be important to test the predictions

379

of these models against experiments. Sensitivity analyses of these models will help identify

380

those reactions and associated rate constants that most strongly determine the chemistry,

381

emphasising the importance of reliable experimental determination of these rate constants

382

in particular.

383

These models are non-linear: they are described by a set of deterministic ordinary dif-

384

ferential equations that depend on powers of concentrations. Therefore, the time-evolution

385

of the system described by these equations will be highly sensitive to the system’s initial

386

conditions and parameters. The set of equations is determined by the chemical network,

387

however, the network employed is more an expression of our own knowledge of the system

388

than a complete representation of reality. Determining when a network is comprehensive

389

enough to accurately represent the system of interest is a challenging task. How can one

390

determine if a key reaction essential for characterizing a system has been overlooked, or if it

391

has been assigned an incorrect mechanism? Additionally, how can it be verified whether a

392

proposed reaction, deemed critical for the predicted behavior, is in fact occurring? Due to

393

the inherently non-linear nature of these models, the complexity of the networks, and the

394

poorly-understood criteria for the “completeness” of a network, there is a risk that the sys-

395

tem will deviate from experimental observations. This is why it will be essential for multiple

396

models to be independently constructed and tested against experimental and observational

397

data, such as data from laboratory simulations of planetary environments, and observations

398

of those environments, especially observations from Mars sample return missions, where the

399

geological history is well-preserved when compared to Earth.

400

Whilst we suggest that this approach is ideal for exploring and testing the first stages

401

of prebiotic chemistry, we acknowledge that eventually the level of complexity will exceed

402

what can be practically modelled using chemical kinetics modelling. Just as it would be

403

inappropriate to model planetary formation using the tools of quantum field theory, the

404

chemical complexity at the interface of the transition from non-life to life will require a

405

different set of tools appropriate to this new explanatory regime. The discovery of this point

406

of transition by pressing on the boundaries of what chemical kinetics is capable of would

407

itself qualify as a significant breakthrough into a new phase of research into life’s origins.

408

Conclusion

409

In this account we presented our motivation to understand how prebiotic chemistry could

410

happen without a prebiotic chemist, an approach we call do-nothing prebiotic chemistry.

411

There is a chasm, of orders of magnitude, spanning both space and time that separates

412

the chemist from the chemistry, yet in the natural environment, this distinction fades. The

413

ever-evolving landscape granted by nature may be a better host for the chemistry than the

414

laboratory, its design limited by such practical considerations as the time it takes to finish an

415

experiment, analytical limitations, and safety. Nature is ever changing, however, its laws and

416

rules are always and everywhere the same, and so the chemistry of a natural environment

417

will inevitably unfold according to the rules of chemical kinetics, rules that can be measured

418

in the lab. In this way, the “Frankenstein” constructed in the lab, 60 may pave the way for

419

discovering the emergence of life on a young planet, so long as the chemical kinetics unfold

420

as expected. As a result, kinetics can act as a bridge between these two regimes.

421

This bridge between laboratory and geochemical environment is far from built. Here we

422

have provided a brief review of the initial components of scaffolding we and other groups have

423

put up. Our work will need continued support for us to make any real progress. Without this

424

collaboration, we may never uncover how life could have emerged in a natural environment,

425

as the chemistry cannot be applied beyond the confines of the laboratory. Whilst we point

426

out that not all groups need to measure rate constants, we emphasise the importance of

427

considering these measurements when conducting experiments and communicating results.
