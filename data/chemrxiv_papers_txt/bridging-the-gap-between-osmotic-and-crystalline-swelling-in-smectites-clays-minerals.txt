Abstract

16

The swelling behavior of smectite clay minerals has been extensively investigated due to their

17

critical role in construction stability. Two distinct swelling regimes have long been recognized:

18

crystalline swelling, involving the incorporation of a few water sheets between clay layers, and

19

osmotic swelling, characterized by the complete delamination of individual clay layers. Crystalline

20

swelling mechanisms have been well established through hydration techniques applied to dry clay

21

in a humid environment, while osmotic swelling has been observed through the gradual

22

concentration of a diluted clay suspension into a more compact, glassy state. Although a linear

23

transition between these two regimes has been proposed, it has yet to be experimentally

24

demonstrated. In this study, we investigate the complete dehydration process of a levitated smectite

25

suspension droplet using in-situ Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). The results reveal a gradual

26

shift from osmotic swelling to crystalline swelling, marked by a transition from a pure nematic

27

glass to a coexistence zone where the nematic phase contracts and a saturated crystalline phase

28

emerges, ultimately progressing to an unsaturated crystalline state. This transition occurs through

29

a continuous process in which the interlayer space decreases from four water layers to zero water

30

layers, forming stratified interlayers along the way.

Introduction

35

Clay minerals are lamellar aluminosilicates, naturally present in most soils and used since early

36

prehistoric times for their unique physical and chemical properties [1]. Among these properties,

37

some clay minerals have the ability to accommodate water within their sheets, leading to significant

38

swelling properties. These swelling clay minerals, such as the smectite group, are constituted by

39

2:1 (TOT) layer whose structure consists of a parallel stacking of one octahedral sheet (O)

40

sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets (T). The presence of isomorphic substitutions by

41

cations of lower valency induces a permanent negative structural charge, either in the tetrahedral

42

or in the octahedral sheet. This charge is compensated by cations present in the interlayer space

43

with a charge per half unit cell ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 [2]. The swelling capacity of smectites then

44

strongly depends on the solvation of these counterions, which is a direct result of their nature and

45

their valency, as well as the ionic strength of the aqueous medium [3]. Swelling properties have

46

been long recognized, arousing the interest not only of geologists but also of chemists, physicists

47

and biologists from academia and industry due to their numerous industrial and environmental

48

applications. Notably, swelling properties of smectites are used to predict the impact of soil

49

modification due to moisture on constructions, for their use as barriers for the disposal of industrial

50

or nuclear wastes or as additives in drilling mud in the petroleum industry [4,5].

51

The swelling of smectites is divided into two main regimes most often qualified as crystalline and

52

osmotic swellings [6–8]. The layer-to-layer distance for smectites at the dry state (0W layer) is

53

around 10 Å. Since the pioneer works of Bradley et al. (1937), the crystalline swelling corresponds

54

to a 1D expansion of the clay layer-to-layer distance by incorporation of water sheets into the

55

interlayer space [9]. It is now well-established that the interlayer space can incorporate several

56

water sheets, increasing the layer-to-layer distance to 12.3-12.7 Å for one (1W), 15.2-15.8 Å for

57

two (2W) and 18.0-19 Å for three sheets of water (3W) depending on the nature of the interlayer

58

cation (size, valency) [10–14]. The possibility of a 4W hydration state with layer-to-layer distance

59

of 21.4-22 Å has been reported since the forties but remains rarely observed, only in systems of

60

montmorillonite samples (low-charged smectite with octahedral layer charge) [7,15,16]. The

61

second regime is the so-called osmotic swelling, which occurs at higher water content. This state

62

corresponds to a complete delamination of the material into individual platelets, typically by

63

dispersing powder samples into ultrapure water [17,18]. When the water content is increased, there

64

is a difference in ion concentration between the interlayer space and the bulk water, resulting in the

65

formation of an osmotic pressure gradient and a reduction of the platelets cohesion [19]. In addition,

66

the cations present in the interlayer space are hydrated and therefore mobile, meaning that water

67

molecules can penetrate the interlayer space to balance the difference in osmotic pressure. The

68

osmotic swelling is possible only for low bonding energy cations, i.e., in the case of smectites

69

homoionized with monovalent cations such as Li+ or Na+ [7,20]. The layer-to-layer distance

70

increases until the platelets are fully dispersed, forming colloidal sols whose stability is governed

71

by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, with the range of electrostatic

72

interactions defined by the Debye length. The colloidal stability of smectites has also been

73

extensively studied theoretically, with numerous models proposed to explain particle organization

74

in the dilute regime (3D osmotic swelling). In this regime, the system initially exhibits an isotropic

75

phase, which may transition into a nematic liquid crystal phase before evolving into an arrested

76

state with nematic-like ordering (1D osmotic swelling), typically occurring at volume fractions of

77

a few percent.

78

To probe the structure evolution, the most appropriate approach is to perform time resolved small-

79

angle X-ray (SAXS) or neutron scattering experiments [21–23] during hydration or drying.

80

Smectites have been studied through two distinct approaches, either by adding water to the system

81

or by removing it. As early as 1954, Norrish [7] suggested a linear evolution between these two

82

regimes. However, this fundamental question has never been explored experimentally so far owing

83

to the difficulty in investigating the transition between fully dispersed and fully dry nanosheet states

84

through a single experiment. We propose here a novel strategy to study the swelling of clay

85

minerals, revealing the transition from fully dispersed to fully dried smectite platelets by

86

continuous evaporation. Among recent developments, acoustic levitation [24,25] emerges as an

87

effective approach for conducting in-situ studies on self-standing droplets, enabling real-time

88

kinetic analysis. The immobilization of droplets at the nodes of an acoustic standing wave, can be

89

experimentally achieved between an ultrasonic transducer and a reflector [26,27]. The combination

90

of SAXS with acoustic levitation can address a variety of scientific challenges, including the

91

investigation of the self-assembly of colloids or proteins [28–30], out-of-equilibrium phenomena

92

and revisiting phase diagrams [31].

93

In this study, the dehydration process of a levitated droplet of smectite suspensions is investigated

94

using time-resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering coupled with an acoustic levitator (LevSAXS).

95

In this configuration, we have been able to fully capture the evolution of layer-to-layer distances

96

from the dilute regime (isotropic/nematic transition and liquid/glass transition) to the concentrated

97

crystalline regime and ultimately the dry state. Notably, this investigation reveals the gradual

98

transition from osmotic to crystalline swelling, defining the various hydration states of smectites,

99

details the evolution of layer-to-layer distances, the relative proportions of platelets involved in

100

each process, and the transitions between these states.

Results

103

Osmotic swelling regime

104

We selected a standard beidellite from Idaho (SBId-1, i.e., low-charged smectite with tetrahedral

105

layer charge), which is known to display a rich colloidal behaviour in dilute conditions with a

106

transition from isotropic to nematic liquid-crystalline phase before forming an arrested phase for φ

107

~ 1% [32]. Before use, the clay sample is purified of accessory minerals and Na-saturated according

108

to previously established procedure [33,34]. Then, a size fractionation is applied by successive

109

centrifugation at various speed and redispersion in ultrapure water, resulting in a dispersion of

110

discoidal particles with a mean diameter of 210 nm (polydispersity of 38%) and an average

111

thickness of 0.6 nm [32]. The volume fraction (φ) of nanosheets is adjusted by dilution of a

112

concentrated stock solution obtained by osmotic stress [35].

113

Upon evaporation of a diluted smectite suspension, the system first evolves through the 3D osmotic

114

swelling regime, followed by an 1D crystalline compression until the dry state. During the osmotic

115

swelling regime, liquid-crystalline phase may appear. Indeed, suspensions of plate like particles

116

can exhibit liquid-crystalline phase transition depending on the aspect ratio as volume fraction

117

increases due to a competition between orientational entropy and packing entropy governed by

118

excluded volume interactions [36–38]. At thermodynamic equilibrium, beidellite suspension

119

exhibit an isotropic/nematic (I/N) transition in the liquid state [32,39]. Above a critical volume

120

fraction, the platelets show rotational and translational arrested motion into a glass-like state

121

displaying a nematic-like ordering. The observation of such phases is typically observed after long

122

equilibration time in capillaries whereas during evaporation the system may be out of equilibrium,

123

possibly impacting these transitions.

124

We first assessed phase transition during evaporation process using LevSAXS set-up (Figure 1).

127

(SWING, Synchrotron SOLEIL). Zoom in on the levitated droplet between the transducer and the

128

reflector with the corresponding image on the Basler camera.

129

In-situ LevSAXS measurements have been performed every second troughs the levitated droplet

130

under controlled humidity, and the volume fraction over time was determined from image analysis

131

of the droplet recorded with a Basler camera. We have performed the experiment with three

132

different initial concentrations: фinitial = 0.1%, 0.4% and 0.55% at 70% of relative humidity.

133

At фinitial = 0.1%, the SAXS curves on Figure 2A and Figure S1A present a monotonous decay of

134

the scattered intensity I with scattering vector Q, that scales as I(q) ∼ Q-2 and the 2D SAXS images

135

are isotropic (Video S1). This feature is characteristic of the form factor of the 2D platelet,

136

describing well the light scattering of an isotropic state where particles are noninteracting and

137

present a free motion. At a certain stage of evaporation (ф = 1%, 866s), the SAXS patterns display

138

periodic oscillations with Q-value following 1:2:3 progression as well as anisotropic 2D SAXS

139

images, showing two facing circle arcs at higher volume fraction, characteristic of the presence of

140

a nematic phase (Video S1). The average interparticle distance can be estimated from the position

141

of the first maximum as: d ≈ (2π)/(qmax). It appears that the I/N transition occurs at an interparticle

142

distance of 58.5 nm, corresponding to a volume fraction of 1%, i.e. to the glass state at

143

thermodynamic equilibrium. So far, there is no evidence of a I/N transition in the liquid state.

144

The same experiment was then conducted with initial volume fractions (фinitial) of 0.4% and 0.55%,

145

which display a combination of isotropic and biphasic states or only biphasic states respectively.

146

This organization was also seen in levSAXS. For фinitial=0.4%, the levSAXS patterns were

147

isotropic, showing a broad modulation in scattered intensity due to the short-range positional, or

148

“liquid-like”, order of the platelets, indicative of the isotropic state (Figures 2B and S1B, Video

149

S2). At фinitial=0.55%, however, the SAXS patterns were anisotropic, displaying periodic

150

oscillations with Q-values in a 1:2:3 sequence, characteristic of a liquid nematic phase (Figure 2C

151

and S1C, Video S3). In both cases, a transition occurred upon drying around 0.9%, as shown by

152

integrating parts of the SAXS images (Figure 2D, Figure S2). This revealed two distinct structural

153

organizations within the droplets. For instance, at 1.06% (515s) there is a first broad peak at 0.01

154

Å-1 corresponding to a distance of 62.8 nm and a series of 3 peaks following a 1:2:3 progression

155

with the first peak at 0.0136 Å-1 corresponding to a distance of 46.1 nm (Figure 2D). This can be

156

due to a heterogeneous distribution of the platelets inside the droplet at a certain stage of drying.

157

Indeed, the evaporation time is large compared to the diffusion of the particles inside the droplet,

158

leading to a Péclet number Pe >> 1 and thus to a preferential organization of the platelets at the

159

interface of the droplet during drying. This distinguishes the face-to-face platelets stacking at the

160

interface with a smaller inter-particle distance from the “bulk” at the center of the droplet with

161

larger inter-particle distances. From 1.12% (632s, interparticle distance of 55.5 nm), the SAXS

162

patterns display periodic oscillations as well as anisotropic 2D SAXS images showing two facing

163

circle arcs or dots (Video S2), characteristic of the presence of a nematic glass. Overall, regardless

164

of the initial volume fraction, the system appears to undergo a transition around 1%, either evolving

165

into a nematic glass or forming a biphasic system. The variation in phase transitions depending on

166

the initial volume fraction is probably due to constant mixing within the droplet, driven by acoustic

167

pressure forces, which prevents the formation of the liquid nematic phase.

177

through partial radial integration of the corresponding 2D SAXS images circled in the

179

From these levSAXS patterns, we can extract the swelling law relating the evolution of the average

180

interparticle distance as a function of the volume fraction. Figure 3 presents the corresponding

181

swelling laws of beidellite during evaporation for the different initial volume fraction. All data

182

point scale on a master curve, whose slope evolves as ф-1, reflecting a local lamellar order of the

183

beidellite platelets. This trend is characteristic of most smectites [17,40], as demonstrated in Figure

184

3, which presents measurements on capillaries of various smectite suspensions concentrated by

185

osmotic stress [32]. In the region of high-volume fraction, the ф-1 dependence on interparticle

186

distance diverges, likely due to concentration heterogeneities of particles within the droplet during

187

the drying process. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the swelling laws at low volume fractions show

188

a ф-1/3 dependence with the interparticle distance characteristic of the 3D swelling of the

189

noninteracting platelets. This regime is not observed by acoustic levitation probably due to the

190

constant mixing within the droplet driven by acoustic pressure forces.

Crystalline swelling

199

As the system dries, the layer-to-layer distance decreases, shifting the nematic peak towards higher

200

Q-values. At a certain stage, clearly defined diffraction peaks appear on the SAXS curves in

201

addition to the characteristic nematic glass pattern (Figure 4A and Figures S3, Videos S4-S5).

202

This corresponds to the crystalline compression, i.e., face-to-face stacks of clay layers with water

203

sheets in between. Before reaching the complete dry state (i.e., 0W layer, with a layer-to-layer

204

distance of ~10 Å), the system undergoes a dehydration process marked by complex transitions,

205

with the presence of different discrete hydration states.

206

For all initial volume fractions investigated (Figure 4B-E and Figure S4), 001 reflections of

207

typical 4W (~ 20.8 Å) and 3W (~ 18.2 Å) hydration states appears in addition to the broad nematic

208

peak, quickly followed by the appearance of a peak corresponding to 2W layers (~ 15.1 Å). We

209

observe the coexistence of these three different hydration states for a few seconds followed by the

210

disappearance of the 4W peaks and the coexistence of the 3W and 2W hydration states. At the end

211

of the drying process, we only have the presence of the 2W layers reflection. It has already been

212

shown that the crystalline dehydration is a continuous process due to layer charge heterogeneities,

213

leading to the coexistence of layers with clay layers having different hydration states in the same

214

crystal, leading to the so-called mixed-layer structures [41–45]. Note however that in the present

215

case, the presence of typical 4W, 3W, and 2W hydrations states on the same experimental SAXS

216

patterns is rather unusual, for high water contents an homogenous 3W hydration state being

217

commonly reported [11]. We have performed the same experiment at 30% of relative humidity

218

(Figures S5-S8 and Videos S6-S7), showing the same continuous process as well as the

219

coexistence of the 2W and 1W hydration states. Accordingly, the different experiments show a

220

similar trajectory with no influence of surrounding relative humidity but rather a change in overall

221

water content. The coexistence of discrete 4W, 3W, and 2W hydrations states, in addition to

222

nematic contribution, likely reflects a heterogeneous distribution of water content within the

223

droplet.

Modeling of SAXS profiles during crystalline swelling

and crystalline regime, the sample at Φinitial = 0.55% was modeled for selected evaporation times

with a fitting procedure considering mixed-layer structures (see methods section). The comparison

249

The evolution over time during evaporation in relative proportion for the nematic phase and the

250

different hydrates (i.e., 0W, 1W, 2W, 3W, and 4W) is shown in Figure 6A. As in the previous

251

section, the average distance between platelets in the nematic phase (dn) can be plotted as a function

252

of its relative proportion (Figure 6B). The distance decreases until a noticeable change in slope

253

occurs when the system reaches 60% nematic phase and 40% crystalline phase. Beyond this point,

254

the average distance remains relatively constant at ~30 Å, until the nematic phase fully disappears.

255

This indicates that during the drying process, the nematic phase undergoes a contraction to a

256

metastable state at ~30 Å. Interestingly, this mean distance between platelets at ~30 Å is consistent

257

with the pioneer study of Norrish [7] for Na-smectite. This contraction of the nematic phase is

258

followed by a shift towards a saturated crystalline swelling regime, and ultimately progresses to an

259

unsaturated crystalline state. The existence of the 4W, which has been seldom reported in literature

260

in the case of montmorillonite-type of smectite is evidenced here for the first time in the case of

261

beidellite. This 4W hydration state can be fully assigned to the crystalline swelling regime owing

262

to the similar coherent scattering domain size (N=6±0.5) as for other crystalline hydrates, whereas

263

for the nematic phase the number of layers in the stack is significantly decreased (N=2.5). As seen

264

from Figure 6A, the crystalline regime follows a continuous process, with the coexistence of the

265

nematic phase alongside 4W, 3W, 2W, 1W, and 0W layers. The final analysis at the end of

266

evaporation indicates the coexistence of 1W and 0W layers that is fully consistent with the final

267

relative humidity reached (i.e., 70% RH).

3. Conclusion

276

In summary, the dehydration mechanism of smectite has been investigated by levSAXS, allowing

277

to probe experimentally and theoretically the linear evolution between the osmotic and the

278

crystalline swelling regime. Upon drying the levitated droplet, we first observe an isotropic to

279

nematic phase transition. This transition is heterogeneous inside the droplet as we observe a

280

splitting of the characteristic nematic peak. The assumption is the occurrence of a faster drying at

281

the edges of the droplet rather than in the “bulk” center. At a certain stage of the drying process, a

282

crystalline state emerges, with a continuous evolution leading to the coexistence of interstratified

283

layers. The process reflects a gradual progression from osmotic swelling to crystalline swelling,

284

characterized by a transition from a pure nematic glass to a coexistence zone where the nematic

285

phase contracts and a saturated crystalline phase emerges, ultimately leading to an unsaturated

286

crystalline state. This transition occurs through a continuous process, where the layer-to-layer space

287

evolves from containing four layers of water (4W) down to 0W, with stratified interlayers.

Methods

290

Sample preparation. Beidellite (SBId-1) was purchased from the Source Clays Minerals

291

Repository of the Clay Mineral Society at Purdue University, Indiana. The structural formula is

292

(Si7.27Al0.73)(Al3.77Fe3+0.11Mg0.21)O20(OH)4Na0.67. Details of the sample purification and

293

preparation can be found in Paineau et al. [35]. In this work, we used aqueous dispersions in

294

ultrapure water at three different initial volume fractions (Φinitial = 0.1, 0.4 and 0.55 %).

295

Levitation under Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (LevSAXS). Small-Angle X-ray scattering

296

(SAXS) experiments are performed at the SWING beamline, SOLEIL synchrotron (Saint-Aubin,

297

France) using a fixed energy of 12 keV. The scattering patterns are measured with two sample-to-

298

detector distances of 6 m and 0.5 m to access a q-range of 0.0011 Å-1 to 0.15 Å-1 and 0.12 Å-1 to

299

1.26 Å-1, respectively. A commercial acoustic levitator (tec5, 100 kHz free jet nozzle) is

300

implemented on the translation table of the SWING beamline. The setup is equipped with an in15

301

house humidity regulator based on a proportional integral-derivative (PID) controller adjusting the

302

relative humidity by injecting either dry or water-saturated (compressed air bubbling in pure water)

303

air inside the levitator chamber. Gas flow is insured by two mass-flow meters/controllers

304

(Bronkhorst). For LevSAXS experiments, a droplet of 1 µL of beidellite suspension is placed using

305

a syringe into the acoustic levitator, at a distance of 1.8 mm between the transducer and the reflector

306

while the ultrasonic power level is set at 4 W. The relative humidity is maintained at 70% to ensure

307

the drying of the droplet over one hour. An OAV and its source of white light is used to monitor

308

the dimensions of the droplet throughout the experiment. A MATLAB code is used for determining

309

the volume and the volume fraction of the sample at each step of the evaporation process. Briefly,

310

this code consists of fitting the shape of an ellipse to the droplet contour and to retrieve the lengths

311

of the major a and minor semi axes b of this ellipse. From these data, the volume of the droplet 𝑉𝑉
4

313

is determined as 𝑉𝑉 = 3 𝜋𝜋 ∗ 𝑎𝑎 ∗ 𝑎𝑎 ∗ 𝑏𝑏, assuming an axial symmetry around the minor semi axis, and

314

the volume fraction as 𝜙𝜙 =

SAXS curves modeling. To characterize the different hydration states, the SAXS curves obtained

315

by in-situ measurements at a q-range of 0.12 Å-1 to 1.26 Å-1 are modeled with a fitting procedure

316

already described in the literature using a trial and error approach [12]. For the crystalline swelling,

317

this procedure considers an interstratified mixed-layer structure that could be composed of up to

318

five discrete states of hydration: dehydrated (0 water sheets, 0W, with layer-to-layer distance at 9.6

319

Å), 1 (1W at ~12.2 Å), 2 (2W at ~15.1 Å), 3 (3W at ~18.1 Å) and 4 water sheets (4W at ~21.0 Å).

320

The number of mixed-layer structures, the relative proportions of the different types of layers, and

321

the mean number of layers N in the coherent scattering domain size along the c* axis are adjusted

322

to fit the experimental SAXS datas. For all fitted patterns, the N values are 6±0.5 for the different

323

crystalline hydrates. To account for the low-angle region associated to the nematic phase, the

324

strategy of Wilson et al. [43] is also considered. Accordingly, several discrete structures with layer-

325

to-layer distances ranging from 24 to 75 Å, with a step size of 3 Å are first generated, considering

326

a mean number of layers in the coherent scattering domain size N=2.5. This set of obtained XRD

327

patterns were then averaged considering a normal distribution around a mean dn value,

328

representative of mean layer-to-layer distance in the osmotic regime. This value and the relative

329

proportion of the nematic structure relative to the crystalline structures are thus adjusted to

330

reproduce the experimental patterns.
