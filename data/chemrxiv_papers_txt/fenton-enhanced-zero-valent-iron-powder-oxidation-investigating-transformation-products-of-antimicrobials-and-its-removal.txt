The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water is of concern due to their
hazardous effect on the environment. Such micropollutants deteriorate environmental
quality and can induce antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Thus, removal of
these emerging contaminants is a necessity and thus requires a clear understanding of the
effective treatment and mechanistic approach utilized in degradation and removal.
Frequently, treatment systems are optimized for the removal of contaminants while the
formation of transformation products and their removal are not targeted. We utilized our
established iron powder catalyzed Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation treatment to study the
degradation of emerging contaminants — sulfamethoxazole, gabapentin, diuron, and
triazine class pesticides. We used state-of-the-art mass spectrometry to establish the
common oxidative mechanistic approach after identifying the transformation products
formed during the Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation processes. Fenton transformed product was
produced after 60 min reaction time when treatment was initiated after adding the optimized
H2O2 and iron powder Fe (0)) in a micropollutant solution adjusted to pH 5. About 5-to-7
transformed products of each micropollutant were identified and predicted to have low
toxicity risk to aquatic organisms. The oxidative degradation pathway of micropollutants
illustrates the shared oxidative mechanism where the aliphatic chain of the heteroatom:
Sulphur (R—S—R as thiosulphate), functional groups (R—C=O, R—COOR, R—NH2, R—
NH=O—N) and alkyl chain present in the target compound was suggested as the prime
region of hydroxyl radicle (•OH) attack. The tandem mass spectrometry estimated the
evolution of sulfamethoxazole-transformed product formation and removal during the
treatment. The informed optimization of Fe (0) Fenton treatment, confirmed through MS 2
was established at 40 min reaction time at which both the sulfamethoxazole and its
transformed product were reduced to trace levels (ngL-1).

Antimicrobials are organic compounds that effectively kill or stop the growth of microbes.
These can include antibiotics, pharmaceutical residues, or pesticides/herbicides1. The
widespread detection of antimicrobial compounds in surface and groundwater has become
a profound global concern with multifaceted consequences2. The presence of
antimicrobials in water contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)

which is an increasing problem for the environment and human health3. In 2019, the World
Health Organization (WHO) identified AMR as one of the top ten threats to world health and
advocated for reducing AMR transmission from all probable sources4. In recent years,
efforts to remove antimicrobials and other contaminants of emerging concerns involve
several physical, biological, and chemical methods. The rationale behind using physical
methods such as filtration and sedimentation is removing pollutants from water by
transferring them to another phase but does not degrade the compound. Biological methods
such as activated sludge treatment and biological membrane degradation are widely used
to degrade organic contaminants. Despite the efficacy of biological treatment in removing
certain micropollutants, challenges persist in achieving complete degradation of a diverse
array of these contaminants. Moreover, conventional biological processes often generate
substantial sludge volumes, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and necessitate high
energy inputs 5. These limitations underscore the need for complementary or alternative
treatment technologies.

Disinfection and solid-liquid separation methods are proven to efficiently remove dissolved
and colloidal solids rather than optimized to transform antimicrobials into non-toxic
compounds. Moreover, most water treatments estimate the degradation of the parent
compound, but identifying transformed by-products during the treatment is profoundly
overlooked. The by-products formed as residuals from incomplete mineralization of
micropollutants removal in water treatment, which may exhibit similar or relatively greater
toxicity to the parent compound is a prime concern in water reclamation facilities. In our
previous study, we identified that substituting iron salt in a conventional Fenton process
with micron-sized iron powder overcame the sludge production challenge and resulted in
non-toxic oxidized pharmaceuticals and pesticide (antimicrobials) residues. The synergistic
action of iron powder [Fe (0)] – oxidative and adsorptive in a heterogenous Fenton process
exhibits about 70% mineralization rate of micropollutants6. The interconversion of iron
species to Fe2+ and Fe3+ functioned as a catalyst and facilitated the Fenton reaction,
nevertheless, the degradation by-products were also absorbed onto the microporous Fe (0)
surface. This conjunction of dual action mechanisms reduced effluent toxicity, signifying a
promising emerging technology in Fenton treatment 6, 7.

We developed a heterogeneous Fenton Fe (0) that was more favorable to micropollutant
removal compared to homogeneous Fenton (Fe2+) due to the oxidative effect of •OH in
solution and the spatial adsorption of by-products on the Fe catalyst 7. A study by Trellu et
al., 2018 8, demonstrated that •OH oxidizes phenol adsorbed onto activated carbon cathode
in an electro-Fenton treatment, thus enhancing the micropollutant mineralization. Similarly,
we suggested putative pathways for micropollutant mineralization through Fe(0), which
specifies the production of degenerative by-products via four possible pathways namely, i)
adsorption of the compound on Fe(0), ii) oxidation of micropollutant, iii) adsorption of the
oxidized compound on Fe(0) and iv) oxidation of oxidized by-products 6. Overall, Fenton
Chemistry plays a significant role in environmental applications, particularly in the
treatment of contaminants. Principally, the Fenton reaction occurs naturally in several
environmental settings. Surface water when exposed to sunlight can generate hydrogen

peroxide through photochemical reactions. Hydrogen peroxide can degenerate to hydroxyl
radicals in the presence of iron and can initiate the Fenton reaction9. The occurrence of these
reactions in a natural environment is evident from the presence of superoxide dismutase
enzyme in microbes which protects against oxidative stress10. Therefore, identifying the
oxidation by-products of compounds with potency to impact environmental and human
health is critical.

The current study is the extended assessment of Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation, and we have
proposed the degradation pathways of common antimicrobials namely, sulfamethoxazole,
gabapentin, and pesticides- diuron and triazine (terbutryn, terbuthylazine) to non-toxic
oxidized transformation products in Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation Process. The acute toxicity of
diuron and antimicrobial properties of studied compounds was previously studied11. The
formation of an oxidized transformed product (TPs) of each analyte after Fenton treatment
was evaluated to predict the degradation pathway. The sulfamethoxazole was further
investigated to detect and quantify the formation of oxidized TPs as a function of time during
the Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation Process. The results of this study provide insightful information
on the degradation of selected pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Identifying the temporal
evolution of sulfamethoxazole broadens the avenue of scientific inquiry to understand the
formation and fate of sulfa-drug and develop a water treatment focusing on identifying and
removal of toxic parent and transformed products.

Sulfamethoxazole [4-amino-N-(5-methyl-1,2-oxazol-3yl) benzene sulfonamide], is used as
an antibiotic against bacterial infections. These drugs are commercially available as 500 mg
and 1 g capsules and 500 mg (5ml)-1 oral solution. The primary therapeutic use of this drug
has been in the curing of acute urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections
(Pneumocystis carinii), meningitis, gonorrhea, and several systemic infections12. The
chemical structure and its physicochemical details are presented in Table 1.
Sulfamethoxazole is sparingly soluble in water, however low KOC value is conducive to
leaching potential. The International Agency for Research on Cancer monographs volume
79 (IARC) evaluates sulfamethoxazole as a carcinogenic potency after prolonged
prescription to animals and humans. Sulfamethoxazole residuals in water pose a threat to
human health, and the ecosystem, therefore, requires scientific outreach for the
identification of transformed products and removal techniques.

115

2. Gabapentin

Gabapentin [1-(Aminomethyl) cyclohexyl) acetic acid] is used with other medications to
prevent and control seizures13. These are available in 100 to 400 mg capsules and oral
250mg-5mL-1 solution14. Gabapentin's chemical structure and its physicochemical
properties are given in Table 1, respectively. Gabapentin is commonly found as unchanged

drug residues in the environment due to minimal metabolism in the human body15. The
presence of gabapentin in the environment raises concerns about its environmental
impacts and may contribute to changes in microbial ecology, particularly selecting for
antimicrobial resistance16.

124

3. Diuron

131
132

Diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], largely used as pre- and post-emergent
herbicide treatment on varieties of crops, an algaecide in commercial fish production 17.
Diuron is also applied as pre-emergence control of annual broadly leafed grass and
perennial weeds18. A report from the Environmental Fate and Effects Division, Washington,
D.C. concluded that diuron contamination in groundwater in California was detected in the
2-to-3 ppb range, whereas the elevated levels pose a hazard to aquatic life and can have
human health implications19. The chemical structure of diuron and its physicochemical
properties are given in Table 1, respectively.

133

4. Triazines (Terbutryn and Terbuthylazine)

134
135
136
137
138

Terbutryn and terbuthylazine are selective herbicides that belong to the Triazines class.
Triazines are absorbed by the roots and foliage and act as an inhibitor of photosynthesis.
These compounds are toxic and tend to accumulate in the environment causing prolonged
pollution20 20, 21. The molecular structure and physicochemical properties of triazines are
described in Table 1.

The calibrated DENVER INSTRUMENT weighing balance was used throughout the research
to weigh solid chemicals. The working solution of 0.1 and 5 mg L-1 was prepared from freshly
prepared 1 and 10 mg L-1 stock solutions in distilled Milli Q water, respectively. The pH of the
micropollutants spiked solution was adjusted to pH 5 after adding iron powder using 1 N
NaOH and 1N H2SO4 and measured using an EUTECH CyberScan pH 11 pH/mV/°C meter
coupled with EUTECH Instruments electrodes. Each experiment was conducted in a batch
process system and the effluents were collected after the treatment. Fenton experiments
were conducted at ambient room temperature, 20±5ºC, and atmospheric pressure in oneliter glass beakers. The 1L volume solution was mixed with horizontal stirring vanes at 400
rpm for one minute and 80 rpm for adequate reaction time. The optimized experimental
conditions of selected micropollutants used to estimate the micropollutant degradation at

experimental condition where 5 mg L-1 of the initial solution adjusted to pH 5 was run for 60
60-minute reaction time for every micropollutant. The system remained undisturbed for 30
min after the treatment to deploy the sedimentation process.

The effluent was collected after sedimentation and vacuum filtration. The iron particles from
the iron powder adhered to the walls of the container and were removed after filtration. The
100 ml sample was filtered through 0.45 μm filter paper (MFTM membrane filters,
nitrocellulose membranes, Merck Millipore Ltd.) The filtered samples were stored in 100 ml
storage glass bottles at ~2-4°C (purchased from Fischer Scientific UK) for up to three days
and used in the analysis.

The 5 mg L-1 of each analyte solution was prepared in fresh Milli Q water from a serial dilution
of freshly prepared 10 mg L-1 standard solution. The experiment was conducted with the
same moles of Fe (0) and H2O2 optimized earlier for 1mg L-1 but using a higher concentration
of the analyte to detect observable peaks 6, 7. The pH of the analyte was adjusted to five using
0.1M NaOH and Fe (0) Fenton treatment was run for 60 min before effluent collection. In
addition, sulfamethoxazole was also subject to complete oxidation for product-ion
fragmentation and by-product evolution as a function of time during the treatment. As a
control experiment, Milli Q water was processed through the same Fenton oxidation
experimental condition, and the full MS scan of the control was subtracted from the
obtained peak. Before analysis, the treatment effluent was filtered through Fisherbrand™
Non-sterile Nylon Syringe Filter, 25 mm diameter, 0.2 µm filters. The filtrate (one mL) was
collected in Thermo Scientific™ 9mm Clear Glass Screw-Thread Vials, stored at 4°C, and
analyzed within three to four days.

The LC-MS master method consists of an acquisition and processing method. An acquisition
method is the multiple-step instruction fed into the LC-MS to identify unknown organic
compounds formed during the Fe (0) Fenton treatment. It includes the Liquid
chromatography (LC) and High-resolution Mass spectrometry (HRMS) methods. The LC

method includes the column used, mobile phase, injection volume, flow rate, and run time
as given in Table 3. The analyte was first fully scanned from the 50 to 750 mass range to
obtain its retention time. The gradient method was incorporated to separate the individual
analytes at specific retention times effectively. The gradient information of the mobile phase
on percentage contribution depending on retention time was developed. The solvents A
(eluent A) and B (eluent B) were the organic and aqueous mobile phase.

The liquid elution gradient begins with 99% of the total volume of eluent A (0.1% Formic Acid
in Milli Q water) in the aqueous phase while 1% eluent B (0.1% Formic Acid in methanol) in
organic solvent was held for an initial one minute. At the second minute, eluent A dropped
down to 60%, and eluent B rose to 40% and was held up to four minutes. Then, eluent A was
again raised to 99%, and eluent B dropped to 1%. The eluent was held until seven minutes
and then, reversed (eluent A: 1%, eluent B: 99%) and maintained along the run time. The data
processing including peak adjustment, generating calibration curve, and quantification was
performed in Thermo Fischer Scientific TraceFinderTM software. Detailed information on the
LCMS instrumentation and method is provided in the Supplemental file S1. The calibration
curve was constructed using linear regression with a 1/x2 weighting factor to achieve the
curve stability and quantification data quality. A deviation higher than +/- 20% from the bestfit curve was not considered while plotting the calibration lines. From the deviation (%
difference), the quantification limit of micropollutants was examined. The calibration curves
of each compound were prepared from 10000 ng mL-1 to 1 ng mL-1 range. The lower limit of
quantification established from calibration standards was – Sulfamethoxazole and Diuron
(25 ng mL-1), Gabapentin, Terbutryn, and Terbuthylazine (1 ng mL-1).

The samples to be analyzed were placed in a chilled (~ 10°C) sampler unit. The adequate
volumes of samples as designed in the method were injected into the column where the
analytes were separated and later entered the ion source. The ion source ionized the
compound and analyzed based on its mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The Dionex Ultimate 3000
RS pump was used to move samples through the LC column, separating components of a
mixture based on their interactions with a stationary phase. The nitrogen gas sprayed at a
voltage of 3500 V, in the Orbitrap Electrospray Ionization (ESI) converts the eluted

The targeted analysis was used to identify the oxidation by-products. The database of
precursor ion mass was curated from previous literature studying the oxidation by-products
of the analyte of interest22 23 24. As of date, and Web of Science search we couldn’t find
literature studying oxidation by-products using Fe (0): iron powder Fenton Oxidation and thus
we were restricted to literature mainly focused on ozonized and photocatalytic oxidation
treatment. The inclusion list of analytes was derived after m/z analysis of each compound
for the obtained retention time in HRMS. The full MS scan (50 –to– 750 m/z) identifies the
compounds on the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) to derive the retention time and precursor ion
information. The mass error was estimated from the accurate experimental mass checked
against the exact calculated mass using the mass accuracy equation. The exact calculated
mass was obtained from the in-house curated database constructed from ChemCal
database search and published literature, discussed later in results. The mass accuracy
(mass error) of ±5 ppm for precursor ions and ±10 ppm for product ions was considered
significant and are discussed in this study.

The retention time and precursor ion data of each analyte were fed into the MS acquisition
method to obtain the product ions information. The fragmentation patterns of product ions
served as a fingerprint and were used to accurately identify the precursor ions and their
oxidized by-product compounds. The m/z of precursor ion and their product ions fed into the
inclusion list are mentioned in Supplemental file S1. The retention time and chromatogram
peaks of each analyte precursor and product ion are provided in Supplemental Figure 1.
Different isomers with the same precursor ion were differentiated after product ion
scanning. The neutral loss- the loss of a neutral molecule from the precursor ion during the
fragmentation in MS/MS was estimated by calculating the difference between m/z of the
product ions from the precursor ion. The characteristics of neutral losses in product ion
spectra were used to identify the functional groups.

Diuron and gabapentin oxidation by-products were identified in both ESI (+) and ESI (-). The
remaining compounds were only detected in ESI (+). The high resolution of MS yields
accurate mass measurements and permits structural elucidation. The accurate
experimental mass obtained was fed into the ChemCal web interface database25 to predict
the molecular formula. The molecular formulae were confirmed after the isotope analysis.

The structures predicted in this study were also referred to previous literature for
confirmation. However, the obtained m/z was only validated after mass accuracy
calculation. The chemical structure was assigned with regard to the parent compound and
based on the chemistry of Fenton Oxidation reactions. The structure and their nomenclature
illustrated in Supplemental S4 were generated from the ChemSketch application software
and RCSB PDB Chemical Sketch Tool available online at https://www.rcsb.org/chemicalsketch 26. The mass spectral data was further studied to identify the structure configuration
and provide confirmation after matching up the isotope pattern of the compounds.

The retention time and precursor ion data of oxidized by-products of sulfamethoxazole were
fed into the MS acquisition method to obtain the product ions information. The fixed
precursor ions scan – single experiment to determine the m/z of product ions produced by
the reaction of a selected precursor ion with sulfamethoxazole and its by-product precursor
ion m/z at tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) at 35 collision energy resolution. The PRM
software was fed with the precursor ion information added as an inclusion list. The inclusion
list was used by software to estimate the product ions of the by-products. The isolation
window of 2 was set for estimation validation. The isolation window in PRM is similar to the
Mass Accuracy in Full MS scans mentioned before. After feeding precursor ion information
in the acquisition method, the ‘Estimate’ standard type was selected and linked to the parent
analyte (sulfamethoxazole). An approximate estimation of by-product concentration was
made from surrogate parent analytes calibration. This step provided strong evidence of the
structural configuration. The change in sulfamethoxazole by-product concentration as a
function of time in the Fe (0) catalytic Fenton oxidation treatment was estimated from the
surrogate calibration curve of sulfamethoxazole

The rate of sulfamethoxazole and its TPs formation and oxidation at consecutive time
intervals was estimated using the established optimized Fe (0)-Fenton Process. A previously
optimized dose of 23.31 mM H2O2 and 27.25 mM iron powder [Fe (0)] was added to the 1 mg
L-1 sulfamethoxazole solution prepared in Milli Q water. The pH of the initial solution was
adjusted to five before initiating the reaction. The rate of change (Δ) in sulfamethoxazole and
the formation or disappearance of its transformed products as a function of time during the
Fe (0)- Fenton Process was estimated as a ratio of the difference in m/z intensity of ions at a
given time (t) from its initial intensity and difference in treatment time (t- 1), given below.

The ECOSAR Program tool v.2.2 developed by the US EPA was used to predict the toxicity of
transformed products using the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) model.
It groups structurally similar chemicals with available experimental effect levels in aquatic
organisms – Fish, Daphnids, and Green algae. The SMILES (molecular text code) consists of
the chemical structure of the parent compound and transformed products generated from
the RCSB PDB 26 were fed into the software to predict the acute toxicity measured by the half
minimal effective concentration (EC50), lethal concentration (LC50) and chronic toxicity of the
tested compound.

We examined the degradation efficiency of a suite of emerging micropollutants hazardous
to aquatic ecosystems with accredited antimicrobial activity. In our previous study, we have
established the synergistic contribution of zerovalent iron powder catalyzed Fenton
Oxidation via oxidation and sorption mechanism, yielding non-toxic effluent water quality 6.
At optimal pH 3 treatment conditions, the Fe (0) Fenton achieved complete degradation and
about 70% mineralization of selected micropollutant 7 6. Herein, we tested the degradation
efficiency of target micropollutants at pH 5 after initiating the Fenton reaction using a similar
H2O2: Fe (0) optimized dose developed in our previous study 6. The heterogeneous Fenton
achieved from Fe (0) iron powder at pH 5 led to significant degradation efficiency for
sulfamethoxazole, gabapentin, diuron, terbutryn, and terbuthylazine. Notably, terbutryn and
sulfamethoxazole (98.42±2.74%) were among the highly degraded micropollutants followed
by diuron (94.69±4.52%), gabapentin (85.91±6.14%) and terbuthylazine (69.21±2.07%),
refer Figure 1. While overall degradation was promising, significant differences (p-value <
0.05) among diuron and terbuthylazine, terbutryn, and terbuthylazine were observed. These
differences in the spontaneity of Fenton treatment might be attributed to structural
variations among the compounds.

Studying the transformation products of varied molecular structures makes it crucial to
understand the degradation pathway of zero-valent iron powder (Fe (0)) Fenton Oxidation.
The low-intensity LC/MS peaks were obtained at treatment optimal conditions, and
therefore, we opted for a higher micropollutant concentration (5mgL-1) to detect the
transformed oxidized products in the Fe (0)-Fenton Process. The compromised oxidation

condition attributed to micropollutant degradation in Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation was
reasonable to observe oxidation products for the given treatment conditions. In addition, the
sulfamethoxazole was also analyzed at optimum H2O2 and Fe (0) dose (implying complete
oxidation), to produce a descriptive analysis of sulfamethoxazole reduction reciprocating to
an increase in by-products formation with the development of treatment as a function of
reaction time. The experimental conditions used to detect transformed products are
described in the method section.

Based on the polarity and functional group of the parent compounds (micropollutants) the
ionization mode to identify the transformed product was chosen. The initial and final
solution after the Fe (0) Fenton experiment was scanned through a full MS scan m/z (50-to750). The Milli Q water subjected to the Fe (0) Fenton experiment without spiking
micropollutants was used as a blank (control) to subtract the control mass spectrum peak
from the test solution obtained peak. The retention time and ion chromatogram of parent
compounds and their TPs are given in Supplemental S2 and S3. Briefly, diuron and
gabapentin TPs studied in both ESI (+) and ESI (-) identified – i) three positive ionization and
four products in negative ionization of diuron TP’s; ii) four and one gabapentin oxidation
products in positive and negative ionization, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole, terbutryn, and
terbuthylazine TPs were studied in ESI (+) and identified six, six, and five TP’s, respectively.

The distribution of TP’s and its isotopes are illustrated in Figure 3 and summarized in
Supplemental S4. The mass accuracy of abundant TP’s precursor ion and the relatively less
prevalent isotopes were used for the structural confirmation. We identified 29 significant
TPs in total, after Fe (0) Fenton Oxidation treatment of each micropollutant. The mass errors
between ±5ppm of the transformed products and its isotopes between ±10ppm were
proposed here after meeting the m/z ratio significant standards. By comparing the accurate
experimental and exact calculated m/z ratio, the molecular formula of TPs was predicted.
The observed isotope pattern further confirmed the elemental composition and structural
configuration was then confirmed from previously published literature and observed the
same TPs after oxidation of respective micropollutants 22 23 24 27 28.

To note, a sulfamethoxazole transformed product TP6-254 has an m/z ratio similar to the
sulfamethoxazole but, was eluted at different retention times. The product was referred to
sulfamethoxazole calibration peaks and analyzed for impurity. The compound was not
found in standards and hence was confirmed as an oxidized transformed product. The
retention time and mass spectrum of sulfamethoxazole, TP6-254, and similar product ions
presented in Supplemental S5 identify TP6 m/z 254 eluted at 5.04 and 5.8 min while
sulfamethoxazole retention time peak was obtained at 4.51 min. Thus, we concluded that
the TP6-254 was either formed after the re-arrangement of sulfamethoxazole molecules or
an N-oxide formation after oxidation of primary amine attached to the aniline ring structure.

A similar product was also observed in a study shown in29, 30 22, and the plausible structure

The elemental composition of sulfamethoxazole TPs was further examined from the
fragment ion pattern in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. The ions of the
TPs of sulfamethoxazole detected in the mass analyzer were subjected to High Energy
Collisional Dissociation (HECD) after collision with nitrogen gas atoms in the collision cell
produced a specific fragment pattern of its product ions. These product ions were exclusive
and were also called the fingerprints of respective precursor ions. The product ion m/z 156
was detected for TP6-254 parent compound sulfamethoxazole (Supplemental S5) and thus
was continued for the elemental composition analysis. Similarly, the product-ion peaks of
TP3-284 were very insignificant thus no detectable fragment pattern was observed.

The fingerprints of TP1-270, TP2-272, TP4-288, and TP5-99 are presented in Figure 4 (a-d).
The precursor ion TP1-270 was fragmented at the sulfonamide bond to produce a product
ion m/z 172, after the loss of a neutral fragmentC4H6N2O (m/z 94). Similarly, TP5-99
undergoes fragmentation resulting in the loss of a neutral fragment CHN (m/z 99) and results
in a product ion with m/z 72. The TP2-272 fragmented into several ions where the key
fragment ions and their potential origins (neutral loss NL) include m/z 156 (NL 116.0593),
m/z 140 (NL 132.0541), m/z 117 (NL 155.0046), m/z 108 (NL 164.0261), m/z 92 (NL 180.0210)
and m/z 73 (NL 199.0307). The TP4-288 key fragment patterns include m/z 156.0123: Loss of
a neutral fragment with a mass of 132.0542. m/z 174 (NL 114.0432), m/z 133 (NL 155.0045),
m/z 115 (NL 173.0153), m/z 108 (NL 180.0211) and m/z 92 (NL 196.0160). The proposed
structure of each transformed product predicted after the literature survey was further
confirmed by the fragmentation pattern. Overall, the presence of hydroxyl (OH) groups and
a nitrogen atom in the proposed structure suggests potential fragmentation sites involving
these functional groups. The loss of neutral fragments containing oxygen and nitrogen atoms
was also evident in most of the fragmentation patterns observed for the sulfamethoxazole
TPs.

The evolution of TPs, illustrated in Figure 4(e) reflects the insights of sulfamethoxazole
degradation and formation or removal of several TPs as a function of time. Incorporating the
information on TP evolution can further optimize the experiment after the selection of the
best reaction time for the complete removal of the parent compound and targeted TPs. The
relative strength of the TPs was estimated using a surrogate sulfamethoxazole standards
calibration curve. However, the estimated level was below the detection limit (1ng mL-1) and
thus plotted against their peak area. The peak area obtained in LC/MS was used to estimate

the relative concentration. The sulfamethoxazole was completely degraded after 40 min of
reaction while in-between oxidation reactions led to the formation of TPs. As indicated by
the low m/z area of TP3-284, we found that relative to the rest of the TPs, TP3-284 was formed
at the beginning of the treatment and was removed after 10 min.

In contrast, TP4-288, a compound with a parent ion peak at m/z 288.0665, was initially
detected at trace levels during the early stages of the Fe (0)-Fenton oxidation process. Its
signal remained below the limit of detection for approximately 35-to-40 minutes.
Subsequently, a rapid increase in TP4-288 abundance was observed, culminating in a
maximal signal intensity at the 60-minute mark of the reaction. Similarly, TP2-272
abundance was increased at the later stages of the treatment, that is between 45 to 60 min.
TP1-270 demonstrated a definite pattern where its abundance was rapidly increased until
the first 30 min of reaction – indicating hydroxylation after the addition of the OH group to
sulfamethoxazole, but m/z intensity was detected at a trace level after 30 min. Refer to
Supplemental S6 to find the exact m/z intensity of each studied at different time intervals of
the treatment. Overall, the rate of degradation of sulfamethoxazole and its TPs at tested H2O2
and Fe (0) dose and initial solution pH 5, suggests 40 min as the optimum reaction time for
the Fe (0)-Fenton Oxidation process of sulfamethoxazole.

The degradation pathway of each studied compound presented in Figure 5 (a-e) was
predicted after concluding the structure of TPs from the product and literature survey. The
aromaticity, electronegativity, presence of functional groups, and polarizability determine
the susceptibility to different types of reactions during the oxidation of analyte in the Fenton
experiment. At pH 5, sulfamethoxazole (4-amino + H+) and terbuthylazine (3-N + H+) remove
H+ from the solution whilst gabapentin loses its H+ ions (-COOH – H+). The
sulfamethoxazole has an olefinic double bond and an aniline group which has a high affinity
for OH radical attack 22. The very prominent reaction pathway of OH radical was observed in
the double bond located on the isoxazole ring. The OH radicals bind to C=C by H-abstraction
or an electron transfer forming TP1-270 and TP2-272 respectively. The addition of OH to the
C=C bond (TP1-270) led to the formation of a tertiary carbon atom-centered radicalmediated another C-OH bond (TP4-288). The oxidation of the tertiary amino group (in aniline
structure) could form a tertiary-NO2 compound (TP3-284). The amino group triggered by the
radical attack would have facilitated the electrophilic substitution nitration process. Next,
TP5-99 was predicted to be formed from the hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfamethoxazole
cleavage. The same mass was also detected in fragment pattern analysis and therefore,
could have also been arising from the further breakdown of the transformed products.

The gabapentin oxidized products were found to be more polar than the parent compound
in this study and previously by Hermann et al.,2015 27. The gabapentin degradation pathway
shown below in Figure 5 (b) demonstrates the strong oxidative effect of the OH radical. TP1188 was formed after the radical attack causing the elimination of the H-atom from the

aromatic ring and substitution of the OH group into the ring. However, the exact position of
OH bond formation was not predicted and hence was shown with Markush bonds. TP2-186
would be formed from TP1-188 after de-hydroxylation causing loss of water, thus, creating a
double bond in the cyclohexane ring. TP2-186 could be present as an isomeric structure and
formed by either an OH radical attack on the N-alkyl group (single electron transfer) or the
OH radical-initiated exclusion of hydrogen atoms from carbon adjacent to the carboxylic
group. Another isomeric structure (TP5-187) was suggested to be formed by two different
pathways-

458
459
460
461

i. The OH radicals attack the amino group, dissociating the amino group (deammonification) and oxidizing the C-terminal.
ii. Another assumption suggested the formation of the carboxylic group at the terminal
position after de-ammonification.

The gabapentin-producing high polar compounds would have caused de-hydroxylation and
H-atom transfer from the amino group and forming a new amino-epoxy aromatic ring (TP3154) or, the TP1-188 would have lost an amino group in combination with de-hydroxylation
and electron transfer to create another new epoxy aromatic structure (TP4-137). A Few of the
by-products formed could have rearranged the compounds after oxidation and electron
transfer producing closed ring structures (TP3-154, TP4-137). Certainly, hydroxylation and
de-ammonification appeared as the instantaneous route for gabapentin degradation
whereas, de-hydroxylation of gabapentin and its products formed stable aromatic
compounds. Overall, new carboxylic and epoxy compounds were suggested to be formed
after gabapentin oxidation in the Fenton process. As shown in Figure 5 (c), diuron
demonstrated two pathways during the Fenton process that is either an OH radical attack on
the alkyl group called alkyl substitution or else through chlorine substitution. Amongst both,
the alkyl side attack appeared to be the most spontaneous route. These routes were also
reported by R.R. Solís et al. during the diuron ozonation process 23. The oxidative mechanism
causing each by-product formation is listed below:

TP1-249 was predicted to form after hydroxylation of the C-H bond on the carbon atom
adjacent to the heteroatom, H-atom transfer. Subsequently, the compound was further
oxidized by single electron transfer from itself forming TP2-219 after N-demethylation. Few
of the TPs formed were suggested to be produced in a stepwise fashion while some of them
might have formed by direct oxidation of diuron. The chlorine substitution compounds were

TP1-249- Oxidative degradation- hydroxylation
TP2-219- N- demethylation (Sequential electron transfer)
TP3-215- Reductive chlorination and oxidative hydroxyl degradation

formed separately (TP3-215). TP3-215 might exist in the isomer or either of the states. The
side chlorine group on the diuron has an equal affinity to withdraw an electron from the ring.
Therefore, the exact hydroxyl attack location was difficult to suggest, and therefore, the
products are presented as isomers. Likewise, the OH radical attack on the aromatic ring
causes an instant substitution of Cl with OH was also stated by Solís et al., 2016 23. TP4-262
was assumed to have formed after a similar mechanism of TP1-249 however; here, the C-H
bond was attacked from two sides on the carbon atom, binding two hydroxyl groups. The new
compound (TP4-262) appeared unstable, which could be possible from steric hindrance or
repulsion from OH groups. The electron transfer from the H-atom would have led to the Hatom leaving the compound, forming an ϖ-bond to stabilize CO after an electron transfer to
the second OH group. The TP6-216 was formed after sequential oxidation of diuron where
dealkylation conjugated with N loss followed hydroxyl attack. The new bond formed was
supposed to rearrange itself, forming an oxidized amino ring structure.

The terbutryn degradation pathway shown in Figure 5(d), suggests the triazine ring did not
encounter OH radical attack and remains unchanged. We confirmed it after analysis of its
fragment pattern which was also previously observed by Luft et al.,24. The Sulphur group in
terbutryn is a prominent nucleophilic center of the compounds which was assumed to form
the sulfonyl of sulfoxides compounds. TP1-240 was proposed to form by sulfur electron-

donating tendency which generated methylidyne-λ4-sulfanyl compound. The TP2-258 was
also an expected product which demonstrated sulfur oxidation and forming terbutryn-sulfuroxide. The N-ethyl terminal transferred a pair of electrons which eliminated ethane and
depicted a formation of lower molecular weight compound TP3-214. The TP3-214 could
further dissociate either to N-dealkylation or N-dealkylation accompanied by ring oxidation
(S-removal) and form TP4- 158, and TP6-168 respectively. TP5-256 could have been directly
formed from terbutryn. The methyl-thiol terminal can potentially undergo oxidation to form
another compound. The TP6-168 formation could involve an electron transfer from the
compound itself and H-atom exclusion forming a carbonyl group. The possible mechanism
of each by-product can be listed as:

The terbuthylazine was oxidized either after an OH radical attack on the alkyl group initiating
alkyl removal or, the OH radical binding to the compound forming hydroxylated products
(Figure 4 e). The specific mechanism that could have produced the TPs was: TP1-174: N-de2’prolpylation after the cleavage of the terminal carbon-nitrogen bond in the propyl group.
The TP2-202 formed either by N-de-ethylation or de-hydroxylation involves the removal of

TP1-240: Methyl thiol oxidation
TP2- 258: Thiol oxidation
TP3-214: N-de-ethylation
TP4-158 : N-de-ethylation, N-2’propylation

the ethyl group from the ethyl group in terbuthylazine or hydroxyl attack to the carbonyl group
to TP4-244 followed by the de-hydroxylation. The N-demethylation of TP1-174 and TP2-202
could result in the formation of TP3-146. An introduction of a hydroxyl group (hydroxylation)
and later oxidation of the compound to form a carbonyl group (C=O) into the molecule could
form the TP4-244 (hydroxylation and carbonyl formation). A combination of two steps of
substitution of chlorine with hydroxyl group (OH) through hydroxylation and removal of an
ethyl group from a nitrogen atom (N-de-ethylation) would have resulted in the formation of
TP5-184.

In our previous study, we used the Microtox assay to demonstrate the effective removal of
toxicity associated with individual micropollutants following treatment with Fe (0) Fenton at
pH 3 6. To further investigate the potential formation of toxic transformation products, this
study aims to predict the toxicity levels of oxidized byproducts generated under Fe (0) Fenton
conditions at an initial pH of 5. The toxicity to aquatic organisms – fish, daphnids, and green
algae was predicted using the Ecological Structure Activity Relationship (ECOSAR)
developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) given in Table 4 and
Supplemental S7. The lower values of TPs compared to its parent compound indicate the
formation of higher toxic TPs in the given micropollutant Fenton oxidation reaction. The
potential TPs which could be more toxic to aquatic species compared to their parent
compounds were Sulfamethoxazole TPs – TP3-284, TP4-288; Gabapentin TPs – TP3-154,
TP4-137 and structural isomers of TP5-187; Diuron TP – TP1-249 and Terbutryn TPs – TP1-240,
TP2-258, TP3-214. In contrast, the toxicity levels of terbuthylazine TPs were lowered to its
parent compound. However, the concentration of sulfamethoxazole TPs detected was in
ngL-1 (three magnitudes lower than the threshold values) and likewise, higher amounts of
initial micropollutants were used to detect measurable TPs peaks in LC-MS, we conclude
that the Fe(0) Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron powder efficiently degrade micropollutants
consists of antimicrobial activity and produce low-risk oxidized products which were
suggested to have reduced hazard to aquatic organisms.

Fenton Oxidation is a promising technology for the removal of emerging micropollutants
from water, involving the generation of non-selective hydroxyl radicle (•OH) from H2O2
disintegration catalyzed by Fe2+ species 31 32. Despite its non-selective oxidation mechanism,
Fenton oxidation is not yet widely used at the industrial scale due to some of the critical
challenges such as excessive sludge production and requirements of high acidic
environment. However, several studies have intervened in these challenges and have used
Fenton in combination with other technologies 33 34 35 36. Studies have also reformed the
catalyst to transform the reaction to a heterogeneous Fenton Oxidation 7 37 38. We have used
iron powder as a Fe (0) catalyst in the Fenton reaction and established the modified Fenton
Oxidation Process which synergistically oxidizes and adsorbs micropollutants thereby
increasing the effectiveness of the treatment. In our previous research, we have
demonstrated that using Fe (0) significantly reduces sludge production and increases the
removal of dissolved organic (DOC) at pH 3 6 7. Herein, in this study, we found that the Fe (0)
Fenton Oxidation treatment could achieve about 70-to-100% degradation of organic
compounds at pH 5 (Figure 1). The difference in the degradation efficiency was suggested to
be influenced by the target compound structure and properties. In addition to estimating the
treatment efficiency, TPs could also be used to study the mechanistic approach of the
Fenton reaction understanding its specificity and susceptible or resistant compounds to
Fenton reactions. Most of the oxidation TPs identified in this study were also found in
Ozonation and other oxidation treatment 22 20, 23, 27, 28 27 suggesting the commonality in the
oxidation mechanism of •OH capable of oxidizing target compound. The type of reaction
between the target compound and the •OH, largely influences the rate and extent of
degradation.

Hydrogen abstraction, addition, and electron transfer were the most common modes of
action observed in our study. In addition to the removal or addition of the OH group, dealkylation, and hydrogenation were the most common mechanisms observed in the
formation of TPs where the target compounds were degraded to low molecular weight
compounds. Overall, the suites of oxidative mechanism and modification in functional
groups observed in this study include i) hydroxylation, ii) de-hydroxylation, iii)
hydrogenation, iv) N-dealkylation, v) methyl oxidation, vi) thiol oxidation or reduction, vii)
amino-group oxidation, vii) C-oxidation (R—CO, R—COOH), ix) Cl group substitution and x)
alkyl group substitution. Steric hindrance due to the presence of an alkyl group in the
compound was also suggested as an influencing factor in Fenton Oxidation. Particularly,
terbutryn and terbuthylazine differ in the sixth position, which might be the primary cause
for the vast difference in their stability. The methyl sulfonyl group (Thiol) in Terbutryn was
found to be more susceptible to oxidation reactions. The thiol oxidation was facilitated with
OH and thus able to destabilize the triazine structure. Consequently, terbutryn was more
easily degraded than terbuthylazine.

The heteroatoms like Cl and S were substituted and oxidized however, the presence of Cl
was also found as a resistance to Fenton reaction in some of the diuron TPs. Cl atom is
electronegative and has an electron-withdrawing nature which could have resulted in
compromising the effective degradation of diuron and its TPs. Except for TP3-215 where
either of the terminal Cl was substituted with OH, the rest of the TP’s has retained its
aromaticity and chloro-substituents. The N-alkyl and amide groups were the primed mode
of oxidation observed in diuron degradation. Similarly, the amine and carboxylic acid
functional groups present in gabapentin were identified as primary target sites for hydroxyl
radical attack during the Fenton oxidation. Overall, we observed that the aromatic ring was
stable, and aliphatic compounds and functional groups were more readily attacked and
transformed during the Fe (0) Fenton oxidation reactions.

Assessing the toxicity of transformation products (TPs) generated during water treatment is
crucial for evaluating potential environmental and human health risks. In this study,
sulfamethoxazole TPs were detected at low ng/L concentrations in the effluent, suggesting
the occurrence of ring-opening and subsequent mineralization. While the low ng/L
concentrations of sulfamethoxazole TPs are encouraging, further investigations would be
required for the potential long-term impacts. The environmental fate of the TPs identified is
critical to understand its persistence and impact on the ecosystem. A few of the oxidized
products detected in this study were also identified by other authors in aquatic ecosystems.
The sulfamethoxazole TPs—TP3-284, TP6-254, and TP5-99 were the biodegradative products
detected by Su et al., 2016 30.

Gabapentin is not metabolized by the human body and is excreted in its intact form. Thereby,
the biodegradation of gabapentin occurring in the environment would determine its
environmental fate. Gabapentin TPs — TP1-188, TP3-154, and TP5-187 were also detected by
Henning et al., 2018 as bio-transformed products of gabapentin in the aquatic environments
39
. Diuron, a phenyl urea herbicide, has been widely used in agricultural and non-agricultural
settings to control weed growth. However, its persistence in the environment and toxicity to
aquatic organisms have raised significant concerns40. In response to growing scientific
evidence, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a ban on diuron use in
all food crop production in April 202241. This regulatory action was primarily driven by
concerns over diuron's potential carcinogenic properties. The metabolic pathway of
bacterial degradation of diuron in aerobic conditions includes TP2-219 as an intermediate
compound to form 3,4-dichloroaniline 40, 42.

A study by Bollmann et al. 2016 43 also detected TP2-258 and TP6-168 terbutryn products
where these products were studied as a leached compound from artificial walls under
natural weather conditions after the photodegradation process. Similar to terbutryn,
terbuthylazine is a triazine-class pesticide widely used as an alternative to atrazine in
agricultural fields. However, the environmental fate is yet to be fully understood. We
identified five oxidized transformed products that were predicted to have low risk to the

aquatic species. Recently, bacteria such as Agrobacterium and others have been found to
degrade terbuthylazine, the TP5-184, detected in this study was also identified as the
catabolism pathway of bacterial degradation of terbuthylazine. Thereby, the simultaneous
shared compounds between the oxidation TPs and microbial degradation of a target
micropollutant could be further investigated to study the complex interplay between these
compounds and their fate in the environment.

The Fenton oxidation process is a developing technology that holds the potential to
effectively remove antimicrobials and other emerging contaminants in water. We have
developed a novel use of commercially available iron powder (Fe (0)) as a catalyst in the
Fenton reaction as a promising alternative to existing homogeneous Fenton. We selected
five important emerging contaminants in our study which were also observed to pertain to
carcinogenic and antimicrobial activities and thus harmful to human health and the
environment. At initial pH 5, the iron powder catalyzed Fenton reaction achieved complete
oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and terbutryn, 90 to 100% removal of Diuron, 80 to 90%
Gabapentin removal, and about 65 to 70% removal of terbuthylazine. The tandem mass
spectrometry detected and confirmed the transformation products formed during the
treatment. The sulfamethoxazole and its transformed products were detected at trace levels
after 40 min and thus suggested as the best optimal reaction time for sulfamethoxazole
removal. These results expand the area of experiment design and optimization and suggest
that studying the formation of transformed products can lead to an informed and high-yield
treatment optimization. The identification of transformation products formed provided a
critical insight into the Fe (0)-Fenton Oxidation mechanisms and hence the degradation
pathway was suggested.
