Abstract
The demand for NdFeB permanent magnets, known as the strongest permanent magnets on the
market, is projected to rise signiﬁcantly. These magnets, made from rare earth elements (REEs) such
as neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), and dysprosium (Dy), are essen al for various high-tech
applica ons, including electric motors for e-mobility, wind turbines, electronics, and air
condi oners. However, their produc on is heavily reliant on REEs—classiﬁed as cri cal raw materials
in the EU due to limited geographic availability and supply risks. Over 60% of global REE produc on
occurs in China, which also controls 91% of REEs reﬁnement and 94% of the permanent magnet
market. Given Europe’s lack of internal REEs produc on and reﬁning capabili es, this dependency
on Chinese imports poses a supply risk.
To address this problem, Europe must establish alterna ve REE sources, either by exploi ng local
mines or implemen ng recycling. Projec ons indicate that by 2050, recycling could poten ally meet
up to 75% of Europe’s REE demand. However, current recycling eﬀorts are limited, with less than 1%
of REEs being recovered. This study aims to inves gate a recycling method capable of recovering
REEs, par cularly from NdFeB magnets embedded within electric motors from e-mobility. The focus
centers on a mechanical pretreatment approach that combines shredding with physical separa on
techniques, such as magne c separa on. The primary objec ve is to isolate a NdFeB-enriched
frac on—a material stream containing a substan ally higher concentra on of NdFeB magnets than
the original motor composi on.
An industrial-scale trial was conducted on electric motors that were ini ally thermally
demagne zed. This demagne za on step is crucial to mi gate issues related to magnet
agglomera on during subsequent mechanical processing. The demagne zed motors were then
shredded and processed via magne c separa on within an industrial facility. The separated frac ons
were subjected to laboratory pretreatment, involving sample homogeniza on, sieving, and magne c

a rac on, to concentrate the NdFeB content. The samples were analyzed through MP-AES to
quan fy the REE content, including Nd, Pr, Ce, Dy, and Gd. This data provided insights into the
enrichment of NdFeB magnets in the treated frac on.
A material ﬂow analysis (MFA) was conducted to assess the distribu on of magnets throughout the
process. The MFA revealed that 71.3% of magnets entering the treatment facility were retained in
the ferrous frac on, while 28.3% were found in the non-ferrous frac on. The ferromagne c
proper es of the NdFeB magnets facilitated their a rac on to the magne c separator, enhancing
the concentra on of magnets in the ferrous frac on. A signiﬁcant increase was observed in the
magnet concentra on in the non-ferrous frac on a er addi onal magne c separa on, with the
concentra on rising from 9.47% in the ini al non-ferrous frac on to 50.8% in the ﬁnal a racted
frac on.
The ﬁndings of the study provided key informa on for the future design of an op mized
mechanical pretreatment process that could achieve both a higher concentra on of NdFeB
magnets and an improved process yield.

1. Introduction
The recycling of REEs, in particular end-of-life products containing NdFeB magnets, o ers a
sustainable and strategic alternative to primary REE production. Recycling could emerge as
one of Europe's main internal REE sources, reducing dependency on imports and diversifying a
market dominated by Asia, particularly China. Diversifying the REE market is crucial to mitigate
risks from external factors, such as supply disruptions from major suppliers, which can
signiﬁcantly a ect REE prices, known for their volatility. By establishing robust recycling
capabilities in Europe, exposure to such risks can be minimized, stabilizing market prices and
o ering greater predictability for industries reliant on these critical materials (European
Commission 2024) (Rizos et al., 2022) (Gregoir & van Acker, 2022).
REE recycling also supports the circular economy by reducing the environmental impact of
REEs mining and processing while promoting the sustainable use of resources (Sprecher et al.,
2014). The European Union is actively exploring alternatives to mining, such as reuse,
substitution, and recycling, which could potentially meet over 75% of the EU's REE demand by
2050 (Gregoir & van Acker, 2022). However, despite this ambition, only 1% of REEs are currently
recycled (Jowitt et al., 2018), and no commercial process exists to recycle NdFeB magnets from
end-of-life products.
Most Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is shredded and subjected to
mechanical separation for valuable materials like iron, copper, aluminum, and precious
metals. However, NdFeB magnets end up in the ferrous fraction due to their magnetic
properties, at concentrations too low for economic REE recovery. Bandara et al. conducted a
study on the REE content within the ferrous fraction separated at WEEE recycling plants,

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x3sh7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0001-4652-2483 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

revealing that ferrous fractions contain between 130 and 290 ppm of neodymium—signiﬁcantly
lower than the 1000-1500 ppm typically found in mining by-products. Without a dedicated
recycling process targeting NdFeB magnets, REE recovery from WEEE is not feasible.
A potential solution for recovering NdFeB magnets from end-of-life products is to separate
them before the waste is shredded. This requires overcoming several challenges: the magnets
are often integrated into the product, ﬁxed with adhesives, and surrounded by screws or other
fasteners. Additionally, demagnetization is necessary, which involves heating the magnets
above their Curie temperature to allow extraction. Two main approaches are available for
recovering NdFeB magnets: automated or semi-automated extraction, and HPMS technology.
Automated or semi-automated extraction involves designing disassembly machinery tailored
to speciﬁc product categories to recover magnets. For instance, Hitachi has developed
machines capable of e iciently extracting NdFeB magnets from products like Hard Disk Drives
(HDDs). These machines use a rotating drum mechanism that applies vibrations and impacts
to loosen screws securing the HDD casing, allowing the separation of Voice Coil Motors
(VCMs), which contain magnets, from the casing. Once dismantled, the VCMs undergo
demagnetization in an electric furnace. Afterward, another machine separates the magnets
from their external support, typically bound by adhesive. Hitachi and Mitsubishi Materials have
also developed similar technology for the automated disassembly of air conditioner
compressors containing NdFeB magnets (Baba et al., 2010).
Simon et al. proposed a semi-automatic system using modiﬁed 3D printer components to
automate the HDD disassembly process for magnet recovery. This system integrates tools such
as drills and microcontrollers to optimize disassembly. A microcontroller, along with barcode
scanners and other electronics, semi-automates the identiﬁcation and removal of screws from
the HDD, reducing the time and labor required for magnet recovery, making the process faster
and more cost-e icient.
Another extraction method is the Hydrogen Processing of Magnet Scraps (HPMS) (Walton et al.,
2015) (Jönsson et al., 2020), developed by the University of Birmingham. This technique
involves exposing end-of-life HDDs to hydrogen ﬂow at atmospheric pressure and room
temperature. Sintered magnets react with the hydrogen, forming NdH₂․₇ at grain boundaries,
causing a 5% volumetric expansion. Due to the fragile nature of magnets, this results in their
breakage into friable, hydrogenated powder. This powder’s coercivity becomes so low that it is
no longer magnetically attracted to the ferrous components in the waste. The NdFeB powder is
then separated from the waste using a speciﬁcally designed centrifuge reactor.
Materials recovered through these technologies, such as intact magnets or powdered magnets,
can be directly used as raw material for producing new magnets through direct recycling
processes. Alternatively, they can undergo indirect recycling, where REEs are extracted in pure
form. In the direct or "short-loop" recycling method, the recovered NdFeB alloy is processed
through hydrogen decrepitation, milling, sintering, and pressing to produce new magnets
(Zakotnik et al., 2009). Compared to indirect or "long-loop" recycling, this approach has a

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x3sh7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0001-4652-2483 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

smaller environmental footprint, as fewer steps are required, and resource and energy
consumption are lower, leading to reduced production costs (Sprecher et al., 2014) (Yang et al,
2016).
However, challenges remain, such as the need to adapt production techniques when using
recycled material due to the impurities it contains. For example, NdFeB magnets from end-oflife products typically have 2000–5000 ppm of oxygen, much higher than the 300–400 ppm in
virgin NdFeB alloy. This oxygen is trapped in the grain boundary phase, which does not melt
during sintering due to the high melting point of oxides (>2000°C), resulting in lower density and
altered magnetic properties compared to virgin magnets (Meakin et al., 2016). Zakotnik et al.
proposed a solution by adding 2% NdH2.7 to hydrogenated NdFeB powder, achieving
comparable density to magnets made from virgin material. Nonetheless, challenges like
standardizing recycled magnets and achieving comparable magnetic properties to virgin
magnets remain.
An alternative to direct recycling methods is indirect recycling, which involves extracting pure
REEs from end-of-life magnets. This process yields a product with the sample properties to
mined raw materials but requires more processing steps, energy, and chemical reagents. The
two main indirect recycling methods are the pyrometallurgical route (Vander et al, 2014) and
the hydrometallurgical route (Lyman et al.,1993).
In the pyrometallurgical route, after mechanical grinding, the magnets undergo hightemperature oxidative roasting (above 800°C). This transforms the NdFeB alloy into oxides,
enabling selective leaching of REEs using strong acids like HCl, leaving iron as a solid residue.
This selectivity is possible because iron oxide is more resistant to acidic leaching than REOs.
After solvent extraction removes transition metals like cobalt and copper from the leachate,
REEs are precipitated using oxalic acid. The ﬁnal product is REO, obtained after calcining the
oxalates.
In contrast, the hydrometallurgical route dissolves the ground magnets in sulfuric acid,
followed by REEs precipitation using basic compounds (e.g., ammonium, sodium, or
potassium hydroxides) to adjust the pH to 1,5. The resulting double sulfate salts of neodymium
are then converted into ﬂuorides through treatment with hydroﬂuoric acid, preparing them for
metallization.
A greener alternative to traditional recycling processes is the replacement of strong inorganic
acids (e.g., HCl, HNO₃, and H₂SO₄) with weaker organic acids. Organic compounds explored
include acetic, formic, citric, and tartaric acids (Belfqueh et al., 2023) (Romano et al., 2023)
(Niskanen et al., 2022).
As discussed earlier, semi-automated, fully automated disassembly or HPMS technology are
key methods for NdFeB magnet recycling. However, these methods face signiﬁcant challenges
due to the complex integration of magnets into products, which are not designed for easy
disassembly. Developing suitable disassembly technologies is di icult, and HPMS is
challenging to implement because the hydrogen access to the magnets is limited.

The focus of this work is to explore an alternative, mechanical treatment-based approach for
separating NdFeB magnets from end-of-life products. Speciﬁcally, the study examines
mechanical separation techniques such as milling, magnetic separation, and eddy currents to
create a NdFeB-rich fraction suitable for indirect recycling to recover REEs. Unlike previous
methods that rely on automated extraction, this mechanical approach seeks to recover the
magnets themselves from the treated material. An initial step of thermal demagnetization is
required because standard industrial treatments fail to e ectively recover REEs, which end up
diluted in the ferrous fraction in concentrations too low for recovery as noted by Bandara et al..
In this study, 160 kg of motors containing NdFeB magnets, sourced from electric scooters,
underwent thermal demagnetization. The motors were then processed in an industrial facility
using a traditional motor recycling process that includes milling and magnetic separation. This
allowed for observation of the physical behavior of the NdFeB magnets during processing and
the mass ﬂow distribution of the magnets within the system. The data collected will be useful
in designing an optimized recycling process speciﬁcally aimed at e iciently separating and
recovering the NdFeB magnet fraction.

2. Materials and method
2.1 Characterization and industrial processing of electric motors
The motors used in this study were sourced from di erent electric scooters of the same model,
ultimately resulting in experimental replicates for the knowledge of experimental variability,
and are brushless direct current (BLDC) motors with NdFeB permanent magnet rotors.
One of the motors was weighed and manually disassembled using standard workshop tools
such as a hammer, crowbar, circular grinder, wrenches, Allen keys, an electric drill, and
various-sized pullers, chisels, and a vise. After disassembly, each component was weighted
and categorized by material type using Niton™ XL5 Plus Handheld XRF Analyzer—magnets,
aluminum, copper, iron, plastic parts, and wiring. This characterization was carried out both for
the entire motor and for each of its individual components.

Figure 1: Electric motor before (left) and after (right) disassembly.

Before being sent to the industrial treatment plant, 46 motors were disassembled (Figure 1).
Portions of the rotors were ﬁled down to ﬁt into a mu le furnace for thermal demagnetization
at 310°C for 25 minutes. The purpose of this operation was to reach the Curie temperature of
the magnets, which would then facilitate their separation from the ferromagnetic fraction
during processing. After demagnetization, the motors were reassembled (excluding the cables,
which were cut during disassembly) and weighed again.
The demagnetized motors were processed at a ferrous waste treatment facility using a hammer
mill for milling, followed by magnetic separation. This process produced two distinct material
fractions: a ferromagnetic fraction attracted by the industrial magnet and a non-ferromagnetic
fraction that was not. Both fractions were weighed in the lab. Figure 2 provides a diagram of this

initial sequence of operations applied to the motors.
After the industrial processing, a detailed characterization of the non-ferrous fraction was
conducted to enable a comprehensive MFA study of the permanent magnets throughout the
recycling process. This analysis aimed to trace and quantify the distribution and behavior of
NdFeB magnets within the material streams, providing critical insights into their separation
e iciency and recovery potential during each processing stage. This step is essential for
optimizing the recycling strategy and understanding the ﬂow of REEs through the system.

2.2 Non-ferrous fraction pretreatment
Larger aluminum pieces were manually removed from the non-ferrous fraction to prevent
complications during subsequent characterization and laboratory treatment processes. The
remaining mass was then screened at 0.1 mm to eliminate the ﬁner, dust-like particles. In the
next step, a representative sample weighing 12.6 kg was extracted from the total 37.3 kg of the
non-ferrous fraction and sieved at 4 mm, separating the material into oversize (>4 mm) and
undersize (<4 mm) fractions.
Magnets were applied manually to both fractions to segregate the ferromagnetic material from
the non-ferromagnetic one, speciﬁcally targeting the fraction containing NdFeB magnets,
which exhibit ferromagnetic properties. This procedure aimed to obtain a fraction enriched of
NdFeB magnet, thereby facilitating the subsequent digestion and analysis needed for the MFA
study of the magnets.
Moreover, following the MP-AES analyses, the e ectiveness of this enrichment process was
assessed to determine its feasibility for integration into a recycling process for NdFeB magnets.
Lastly, the ferromagnetic fraction was further sieved manually at 1 mm, resulting in three
distinct fractions with varying particle sizes. Figure 3 illustrates all the steps undertaken on the
non-ferrous fraction.

The obtained fractions were digested using acid solutions and characterized using the Agilent
MP-AES 4210 model, as detailed in the section "Digestion and Characterization of Samples via
MP-AES," to determine the content of REEs within the di erent fractions to conduct an MFA
study of the magnets in the process Additionally, the fractions were analyzed using a Total
Organic Carbon Analyzer to assess the organic fraction present. The fraction with particle sizes
greater than 4 mm was not analyzed due to its excessive heterogeneity, as samples for the TOC
analysis must not exceed a speciﬁc weight limit

2.3 Digestion and MP-AES characterization
NdFeB magnets from electric motors
Six magnets were randomly extracted from di erent electric motors, and 0,25 g aliquots were
taken from each magnet using steel shears. Each aliquot was placed into a 50 mL ﬂask along
with 2 mL of 65% HNO₃. This procedure was conducted under a fume hood to manage the
formation of nitrogen dioxide. Once the brown nitrogen dioxide fumes had dissipated, 8 mL of
37% HCl was added to each ﬂask. The volume in each ﬂask was then brought to 50 mL with
Milli-Q water. The digested samples were diluted at ratios of 1:10 and 1:100 with a 2% HNO₃
solution for MP-AES analysis. The elements analyzed included Fe, Nd, Pr, Dy, Ce, Gd, Cu, Co,
and Al, which are the primary constituents of NdFeB magnets.
Ferromagnetic fraction with particle size between 0.1 mm and 1 mm
Three samples of approximately 1 g each were taken from the ferromagnetic fraction with
particle size between 0.1 mm and 1 mm and calcined in a mu le furnace for 1.5 hours at 600°C.
Each sample was then reﬂux-digested in a ﬂask for 10 hours with 20 mL of aqua regia (4 mL
65% HNO₃ and 16 mL 37% HCl). The resulting solutions were transferred to 100 mL ﬂasks, along
with the digestion residue, and the ﬁnal volume was adjusted. Before MP-AES analysis, the
samples were ﬁltered and diluted at ratios of 1:10 and 1:100 using a 2% HNO₃ solution.
Ferromagnetic fraction with particle size between 1 mm and 4 mm
Three samples of approximately 25 g each were taken from the ferromagnetic fraction with
particle size between 1 mm and 4 mm and calcined in a mu le furnace for 1.5 hours at 600°C.
Each sample underwent reﬂux digestion in a ﬂask for 10 hours with 100 mL of aqua regia (20
mL 65% HNO₃ and 80 mL 37% HCl). The solutions were then transferred to 250 mL ﬂasks, along
with the digestion residue, and the ﬁnal volume was adjusted. Prior to MP-AES analysis, the
samples were ﬁltered and diluted at ratios of 1:10 and 1:100 with a 2% HNO₃ solution.
Ferromagnetic fraction with particle size greater than 4 mm
A sample weighing 180 g, taken from the ferromagnetic fraction with particle size greater than
4 mm, was calcined at 600°C for 1.5 hours. Subsequently, the sample was screened using a
steel sieve with a 2 mm sieving size. The oversize fraction was manually separated into
homogeneous components, such as iron, copper, and magnets, which were visually
identiﬁable at this size. The undersize fraction was divided into three replicates of
approximately 20 g each, which were then reﬂux-digested in a ﬂask with 80 mL of aqua regia
(composed of 16 mL of 65% HNO₃ and 64 mL of 37% HCl) and brought to volume in 250 mL and

500 mL ﬂasks. This methodology was adopted to reduce the amount of sample requiring
digestion. Before MP-AES analysis, the samples were ﬁltered and diluted at ratios of 1:10 and
1:100 using a 2% HNO₃ solution. The elements analyzed included Fe, Nd, Pr, Dy, Ce, Gd, Cu,
Co, and Al.
Non-ferrous fraction with particle size less than 0.1 mm
For the characterization of the fraction smaller than 0.1 mm, three aliquots of approximately
250 mg were digested in a microwave (Advanced Microwave Digestion System ETHOS EASY)
with 10 mL of aqua regia (composed of 2 mL of 65% HNO₃ and 8 mL of 37% HCl) at a
temperature of 190°C for 25 minutes. After cooling, the solutions were diluted in 50 mL ﬂasks
using 0,2% HNO₃ and analyzed using MP-AES. The elements analyzed included Nd, Pr, Dy, Gd,
and Ce.
Non ferromagnetic fractions with particle size greater than 4 mm and between 1mm and 4mm
The non-ferromagnetic fractions with particle sizes greater than 4 mm and between 1 mm and
4 mm were excluded from analysis. Thorough inspection with magnets conﬁrmed that these
fractions contained no remaining ferromagnetic material (e.g., NdFeB magnets), rendering
further analysis via digestion and MP-AES unnecessary for the purposes of this research.

2.4 Mass Flow Analysis (MFA) Study
The MFA study of NdFeB magnets within the treatment process was conducted using data
obtained from the industrial trial and laboratory characterization. Speciﬁcally, the MFA analysis
utilized the masses of the di erent fractions generated during the industrial trial, the results
from screening and magnetic separation performed in the laboratory, and the percentage of
neodymium (Nd) measured via MP-AES in these fractions.
The total mass of NdFeB magnets in the treated electric motors was calculated by multiplying
the average mass of magnets per motor—determined during the material characterization of
the motors—by the total number of motors processed at the facility. To estimate the quantity of
magnets in each fraction obtained through treatment in the facility and laboratory handling
(e.g., screening and magnetic separation), we divided the percentage of Nd in the fraction
considered by the percentage of Nd in the electric motor magnets, and then multiplied by the
mass of that fraction using the following formula:
m magnets fraction= (%Nd fraction / %Nd magnets)*m fraction

Where:
mmagnets fraction= mass of magnets present in the fraction considered
%Ndfraction = percentage of Nd within the fraction considered
%Ndmagnets= percentage of Nd within the electric motor magnets
mfraction = mass of the fraction considered

The concentration of Nd was chosen as the reference parameter for the presence of magnets,
as it is the most abundant REE within the magnets. The ratio of %Ndfraction to %Ndmagnets multiplied
by 100 provides the mass percentage of magnets within the fraction considered. These
percentages were used to evaluate the e ectiveness of the enrichment process for magnets in
the fractions subjected to magnetic separation at laboratory level.

The reassembled motor after thermal demagnetization has a lower mass compared to its initial
weight, as it does not include portions of the rotor and electrical cables. The total mass of the
motors prior to disassembly was 170,6 kg, while the total mass sent to the industrial facility
amounted to 164,6 kg.
The demagnetized electric motors were sent to an industrial recycling plant for processing,
which included milling with a hammer mill and magnetic separation. After treatment at the
facility, two fractions were obtained: one classiﬁed as ferrous, weighing 99,2 kg and attracted
by the magnet, and the other classiﬁed as non-ferrous, weighing 77,4 kg and not attracted by
the magnet. It was noted that the combined mass of the ferrous and non-ferrous fractions
totaled 176,6 kg, which exceeds the initial mass input into the facility, recorded at 164,6 kg. This
discrepancy can be attributed to foreign materials that accumulated in the plant during
previous processing campaigns.
It is important to clarify that the ferrous fraction does not consist solely of ferromagnetic
materials, and conversely, the non-ferrous fraction is not composed exclusively of nonferromagnetic materials. The e iciency of industrial magnetic separation is inﬂuenced by the
type of material being processed, which varies based on the nature of the waste and the degree
of milling. Visually, a signiﬁcant portion of NdFeB magnets, a ferromagnetic alloy, was found in
the non-ferrous fraction. One of the aims of this study is to determine how NdFeB magnets are
distributed between the two fractions, conducting a MFA study of the magnets within the
industrial treatment process for electric motors.
In the non-ferrous fraction, coarse aluminum pieces were manually removed, totaling 36.1 kg.
Subsequently, the non-ferrous fraction was screened at 0.1 mm, resulting in an undersized
fraction weighing 3.3 kg. Both operations were conducted to facilitate laboratory
characterization of the non-ferrous fraction. Below is block scheme (Figure 5) illustrating the

Subsequently, work focused on the non-ferrous fraction with a particle size greater than 0.1
mm, from which 12.6 kg were taken as a representative sample of the total mass. This sample
was screened at 4 mm, resulting in two distinct fractions, which were then subjected to
magnetic separation using manual screening with a magnet to divide the ferromagnetic
component from the non-ferromagnetic one. This step aimed to obtain enriched fractions of
NdFeB magnets, which are attracted to the magnet due to their ferromagnetic properties,
thereby facilitating the digestion and analysis operations required for the MFA study of the
magnets.
Subsequent MP-AES analyses allowed for the quantiﬁcation of magnet presence in the
di erent fractions of the process and the evaluation of the e ectiveness of the enrichment
achieved through magnetic separation. The goal was to assess the feasibility of integrating this
process into the recycling of NdFeB magnets from electric motors. The ferromagnetic
component with a particle size less than 4 mm was further screened at 1 mm to obtain
homogeneous samples, thus simplifying characterization. Figure 6 presents a block scheme

The results indicate that the carbonaceous fraction, which can be considered as entirely
organic carbon since there are no inorganic carbon components within the motors, is most
prevalent in the fraction with a particle size of less than 0.1 mm, comprising approximately
17%. This higher concentration is likely attributed to the physical characteristics of the carbonrich components present in the non-ferrous fraction, such as plastics, which easily break
down.
To complete the MFA study of the magnets in the process, the various fractions obtained
through sieving and magnetic separation, as well as the magnets contained within the electric
motors, were analyzed using MP-AES. The elements examined included Fe, Nd, Pr, Dy, Ce, Gd,
Cu, Co, and Al.
Table 5 presents the results of the MP-AES analysis conducted on the magnets found in the
electric motors. Notably, a high concentration of Ce is observed; this element is used to
partially replace Nd, resulting in reduced magnet performance at a lower raw material cost. The
compositions of the fractions are then displayed from left to right: the ferromagnetic fraction
with a particle size between 0.1 mm and 1 mm, with a size between 1 mm and 4 mm, and
greater than 4 mm. It is important to note that the fraction above 4 mm does not exhibit a

The results from the MP-AES analyses allowed for the construction of a mass ﬂow diagram of
the magnets, illustrating their distribution across the various fractions. The mass ﬂow of the
magnets is depicted in the diagram in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Mass ﬂow (in kg) of the magnets from the motors throughout the treatment process and the laboratory treatment of
the fractions.

It can be observed that most of the magnets (71.4%) ended up in the ferrous fraction due to
their ferromagnetic nature. The demagnetization step eliminated any issues of magnet
agglomeration during milling, allowing a portion of the magnets (28.3%) to remain in the nonferrous fraction after magnetic separation in the industrial facility.
Table 6 presents the mass percentages of magnets across various particle size fractions,
including the ferromagnetic fraction and the non-ferrous fraction (excluding aluminum). These
values were calculated by dividing the mass of magnets present in each fraction by the mass
of the corresponding reference fraction.

The magnetic separation conducted on the non-ferrous fraction sample resulted in a signiﬁcant
enrichment of magnets in the ﬁnal composition. Speciﬁcally, the initial percentage of magnets
in the non-ferrous fraction increased from 9.47% to 38.9% in the ferromagnetic fraction of size
0.1 < x < 1 mm, reaching a maximum of 59.2% in the ferromagnetic fraction of size 1 < x < 4 mm.
Overall, the total ferromagnetic fraction exhibits a magnet content of 50.8%.

4. Conclusions
This study characterized electric scooter motors in terms of their content of copper, iron,
aluminum, plastic, and NdFeB magnets. Approximately 160 kg of motors were thermally
demagnetized at 310 °C for 25 minutes and subsequently treated in an industrial plant using a
conventional recycling process for electric motors, which involved milling with a hammer mill
and magnetic separation. This process yielded a magnetically attracted fraction deﬁned as the
ferrous fraction and a non-attracted fraction known as the non-ferrous fraction.
The non-ferrous fraction underwent a pre-treatment process at laboratory level involving
sample homogenization and concentration, consisting of sieving and magnetic attraction using
magnets, followed by MP-AES analysis to determine the content of REEs such as Nd, Pr, Ce, Dy,
and Gd to assess magnet concentration. The collected data were utilized for a MFA study of
magnet distribution throughout the process. The MFA revealed that 71.3% of the magnets
entering the plant ended up in the ferrous fraction, while 28.3% were found in the non-ferrous
fraction.
The thermal demagnetization e ectively eliminated issues related to magnet agglomeration
during milling; however, the ferromagnetic nature of the magnets ensured that the majority
were attracted to the magnetic separator. The concentration of magnets in the ferromagnetic
fractions obtained through magnetic attraction of the non-ferrous fraction showed a signiﬁcant
increase, rising from an initial mass concentration of 9.47% in the non-ferrous fraction to 50.8%
in the attracted fraction. This indicates that the process represents a viable method for
separating NdFeB magnets from a matrix of non-ferrous materials.
The introduction of a thermal demagnetization step prior to the treatment of the electric motor
in the industrial facility enabled the recovery of a fraction containing approximately 50% NdFeB
magnets, resulting in a yield of 28.3%.
The research conducted on electric motors demonstrated that a thermal demagnetization
treatment, performed before sending the motors to the industrial treatment facility for milling
and magnetic separation operations, signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the behavior and distribution of
NdFeB magnets within material ﬂows. These insights will be crucial for developing an optimized
mechanical process aimed at enhancing the value of the NdFeB magnet-containing fraction,
thereby improving both the overall yield of the process and the concentration of magnets in the
ﬁnal enriched fraction.
