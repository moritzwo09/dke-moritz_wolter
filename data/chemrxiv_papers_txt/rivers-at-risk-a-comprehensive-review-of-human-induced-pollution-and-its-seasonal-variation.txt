Abstract
The worldwide deficiency of clean water is common for both developed and developing countries.
Current time reports claims, Municipal solid waste from India estimated to contribute 10% waste
leakage to world’s rivers till 2020, according to study. Future scenarios where population growth is high,
but urbanization slow, India and China will face great leakage into rivers due to rural population close to
water courses throughout 2025. A little over half of India’s 603 rivers were found to be polluted by the
Central Pollution Control Board in 2022.This same issue stretches out to districts inside nations, like the
Indian territory of Uttarakhand, known for its perfect climate however presently confronting extreme
water quality issues. The proposed review utilizing multivariate factual procedures viewed that as 90%
of water tests from Doon were contaminated. Rising populations, industrialization, and urbanization
have expanded the interest for clean water, strengthening this emergency.
This review study broke down river water quality in Uttarakhand across various seasons — summer,
winter, and monsoon. The outcomes were contrasted with norms set by the Central Pollution Control
Board (CPCB), Indian Standard Institute (ISI), and the World Health Organization (WHO). Various
parameters like Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Ammonia-N, Chloride, Sulfate, Chemical Oxygen
Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Electrical Conductivity, Alkalinity, Total
Hardness, temperature, E. coli, pH level, Dissolved Oxygen, and Turbidity were measured and analyzed.
Study will demonstrate requirement for vigorous systems to safeguard water assets and safeguard
general wellbeing, highlighting the basic requirement for composed worldwide endeavors to address the
water emergency.

Introduction:
On earth, survival rely upon three main sources including water, air and soil and all these three are given
us by nature, from which water is most crucial from all others, water is chief source required for the
origin of life, that makes 50-95% of all plants and animals, but now water is poorly managed source in
the world (S.O. Fakayode 2005). The total quantity of water that is crucial to utilize available as fresh
water for human is 0.3-0.5% only (Hegde and Kale 1995). Rivers along with their drainage basin are
major fragment of true inheritance. It is used by humans from the time they appear only few of the rivers

are left with unaffected condition (Ngoye and Machiwa 2004). Most of the activities are dependent up
water (Siamak Gholami and S.Srikantaswamy 2009).
The quality of water depends upon the physical, chemical and biological characteristics shows the
environmental change, activities done in it and seasons facing by it, the pollution increase with the
increase of industries, agriculture production and urbanization (S. Postel 1997). In world about 20
percent population is facing the shortage of clean drinking water (László J. Dávid 2007). The water
ecosystem are getting too much contaminated due to raw sewage (includes flushing from toilets, wastes,
that drains from sinks, bathtubs, showers and other faucets in homes that are collected from homes after
its being used known as waste and raw sewage) and the waste from industries falling directly or
indirectly in river water. These wastes involved both organic and inorganic polluting solvents and solid
mixtures that have- solvents and solids such as oils, grease, plastic, pesticides, phenol, heavy metals and
suspended solids. These pollutants enters to the river through transports ways that are normally storm
water runoff, ditches and creeks through discharges, leaching, ground water, agricultural lands,
urbanization and industrialization near rivers and atmospheric deposits and these pathways are
dependent upon the seasons. Hence, the seasonal changes can also be assumed as a pathway of changing
in the quality of water (Ying Ouyang 2005). The Open disposal, disposal and dumping of dead bodies is
also one reason for water pollution (Moingt et al.,2013). Hydrochemistry shows the heavy concentration
of pollutant in water hardly affects the spatial and temporal abnormalities of water (Singh et al., 2005,
Zhang et al., 2017). As the number of water born disease increase, there is result in reducing health
strength and ability of body (Sharma, M.L., 1996).
The primary source of water used by humans is for agricultural irrigation, industrial purposes, and
personal consumption. Human activities, both direct and indirect, are increasingly affecting water
quality, making it more unfit for use day by day. Consequently, water quality has become a global
problem (Mahananda et al., 2005). The deterioration of river water quality is caused by natural processes
and human activities, particularly the discharge of industrial, agricultural, and domestic wastes into
rivers. A significant portion of river water quality is impacted by these wastes (Stephen R. Carpenter et
al., 2011). The health of water ecosystems depends on the variety of organisms and their physiochemical characteristics (Venkatesharaju et al., 2010). Certain healthcare issues and a major loss in
biological diversity have arisen due to the adverse impact of pollution in waterways. Consequently,
aquatic life is expected to be more significantly affected than terrestrial life (Sala et al., 2000)
Any negligent disposal or dumping of waste, including hazardous chemicals, into rivers leads to severe
environmental damage and distress to the biological communities inhabiting those waterways (Vega et
al., 1998; Singh et al., 2004). Water pollution adversely affects human health, disrupts aquatic
ecosystems, and hampers social and economic development (Milovanovic, 2007). The increasing
problem of toxic pollution and eutrophication is generally related to point and non-point sources of
pollution (Sharma, 1996; Jain, 2002). Research indicates that global water quality issues are due to both
anthropogenic and natural activities that affect water quality, such as temperature and precipitation (Y.
Ouyang, 2006, Shrestha and Kazama, 2007). Highly toxic and hazardous chemicals or compounds

present in water readily combine with or are retained by immovable or organic matter within rivers.
These compounds settle near the lower part of the area, where they are stored with impurities and low
concentrations of compounds that are not easily soluble or compatible (Biney et al., 1994)
The care of both the quality and quantity of water is required for its use by humans and the surrounding
environment (Chang, 2008). Without fresh water of good quality and adequate quantity, sustainable
development is impossible (M. Kumar et al., 1997). Good and healthy water is an essential requirement
for public health, current water management, and future preparation to address pollution (Khadam and
Kaluarachchi, 2006; Singh et al., 2005). Seasonal changes describe the quality of surface water, playing
an important role in assessing pollution changes in particular areas over time, whether naturally
occurring or influenced by human activities such as urban, agricultural, industrial, and domestic
wastewater; sewage from metropolitan centers; small electroplating workshops; repair shops; hospitals;
and medical and scientific laboratories. Therefore, regular monitoring and identifying water quality
requires a good management system for maintaining healthy life. This method provides information
about the current condition and situation of local water, including the quality of river water and its
regular changes (Sarkar et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007; Srivastava et al., 2011; Bu et al., 2009; Vega et
al., 1998).
The rising development of industries has led to an increase in toxic pollution in rivers, as these industries
often discharge waste into waterways. Seasonal analysis of water quality samples helps identify natural
and man-made sources of pollution, including metal plating, repair works, hospitals, industries,
laboratories, medical equipment, domestic wastes, and agricultural wastewater. These are essential
contributors to point and non-point sources of water pollution. The results of such analyses can help
minimize pollution problems in rivers resulting from mining and industrial activities. Consuming
polluted water can cause diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, amoebiasis, jaundice,
and infections by Enterobacteriaceae (Mishra, 2010). A significant global effort to address
environmental issues began with the UN Conference held in June 1972 in Stockholm, focusing on the
environment and human health. Since then, concepts related to eco-friendly environments and
sustainable practices have become central to policy-making worldwide to protect the environment from
pollution (Gupta, 2001). The increase in water pollution worldwide has led to numerous deaths and
diseases, with approximately 14,000 people dying each year due to water pollution (Lechinger 2000;
Pink, 2006; Larry, 2006). Both developed and developing countries face problems related to water
pollution (Florescu et al., 2010).
Regular management, assessment, and prevention of river water pollution help control additional losses
and warn people of potential future damages (Srivastava et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2005). Different
health organizations have established various standards for water quality (Lester, 1969). The results
from water examinations are compared to standards set by the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board),
Indian Standards (ISI), U.S. Public Health Service Drinking Water Standards (USPHS, 1962), Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR, 1962), and WHO (World Health Organization). These standards
prescribe the necessary limits to be maintained by communities, as water quality directly affects human
health, making these standards crucial for human well-being (Umar, 2000). Effective monitoring of

water quality involves sampling collection from regional and 9temporal areas, providing details about
the physical state of the river and changes in the environment over time and across seasons and
geographical locations (Berzas et al., 2000, Simeonov et al., 2003).
The main factors affecting water quality include climate, precipitation, soil type, vegetation, geology,
flow conditions, groundwater, and human activities. On a large scale, water quality is impacted by point
sources such as municipalities and industries. Other activities affecting water quality include mining,
urban development, agriculture, and non-point sources of pollution, including sediments, nutrients, and
toxic contamination (National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress, 2009). Lotic habitats have
been heavily impacted by various wellness issues, leading to a significant reduction in biological
diversity. In the future, the depletion of biological diversity and its impacts are expected to be higher for
lotic habitats compared to terrestrial biomes (Sala et al., 2000).
The highest authority on managing the quality of water in India is for the Central Pollution Control
Board (CPCB). The type, degree and the amount of degradation of water quality is known by CPCB, to
plan and manage water quality project intelligently. Hence a strong water quality monitor scientifically
by program is required, understanding this, the CPCB started paying attention and started monitoring the
quality of water from 1976 and built 18 stations across the Yamuna River and further this strategy
extended steadily. In partnership with state pollution control boards/Committees, the CPCB monitors
4484 locations across 28 states, 7 Union Territory including 2108 rivers,713 on unchanged water
bodies( lakes, ponds and tanks), 64 creeks (marine, 1235 on wells and 364 on the other water bodies
(drains, canals, WTPs/STPs) (file:///G:/CPCB).
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 is enacted by the Indian Government to
maintain wholesomeness of aquatic resources to maintain the water resource clean. The act defined the
amount of function of the pollution control board in states as level and CPCB at national level for
eliminating and regulating the contamination, this legislation aims to protect and recover the healthy
condition of the nation water resources. The level of purity which has to be maintained or recovered in
entire country’s different bodies of water is not defined in Acts provisions. Through this effort describe
the health in respect to preserving human utilization. The CPCB utilize the private consumption of the
water and its starting point to determine standard quality of water bodies throughout the country. The
task of preserving and restoring all water related basin back to its original state. Implementing the
pollution mitigation operations to achieve this type of goal is going to hamper economic activities or
prohibitively costly. The objectives is to recover and maintain the natural bodies of water or with their
best utilization knowing that they have to be employed in a range of opposing or contending goals. Main
functions of the Central Pollution Control Board: Is to suggest Central Government on the matters
related to the restoration and maintaining the wholesomeness of water resources and the prevention,
control and abatement of water pollution, To make planning and cause to be executed a nation-wide
program for the protecting, monitoring and abatement of water pollution, to give technical training and
guide to the local Pollution Control Board, is to hold and sponsor inventing and researching related to

protection, control and policy of water pollution, To collect, compile and publish technical and statistical
data related to water pollution and to lay down and annul standards for the quality of water in streams
and wells. To perform the above functions, CPCB needs continuous monitoring of water quality of
aquatic resources in the country. CPCB has established a network of water quality monitoring to fulfill
the following objectives (http://www.cpcb.nic.in).
Material and Methodology:
pH: The full meaning of pH is Power of Hydrogen. The hydrogen molecules in a substance determine
its acidic or basic nature. Meaning, if the pH of a liquid or product is 1 or 2 then it is acidic and if the pH
is 13 or 14 then it is alkaline. If pH is 7 then it is neutral. pH stands for 'potential of hydrogen' or 'power
of hydrogen'. It is a scale used to specify the acidic nature or basicity of an aqueous solution. Acidic
solutions (solutions with high concentration of H ions) are measured to have a lower pH value than basic
or alkaline solutions. If we talk about the human body, pH balance plays an important role in the
chemical makeup of the human body. The term 'pH' refers to whether a substance is an acid, an alkaline
(also called basic) or neutral (Shailesh Kumar Dewangan et al., 2007).
Turbidity: High turbidity means that the water is not very clean. Less turbidity means the water is
cleaner. Turbidity is caused by suspended solids in water. These particles scatter light, making the water
appear cloudy or cloudy. Turbidity can be seen with the naked eye. Turbidity is often used to estimate
water quality. High turbidity means low water quality. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), the turbidity of drinking water should not exceed 5 NTU. Ideally, it should be less than 1
NTU. Optical devices are used to measure turbidity. With this device, particles hidden in water become
visible. The particles can provide a hiding place for harmful microorganisms and thus protect them from
the disinfection process. Suspended material can clog or damage a fish's gills, reduce its resistance to
diseases, reduce its growth rate, affect the maturation of eggs and larvae, and affect fishing methods can
affect the efficiency of the fishing method.
Suspended particles provide adsorption medium for heavy metals such as mercury, chromium, lead,
cadmium and many hazardous organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and many pesticides. The amount of available food is reduced because
high turbidity increases the temperature of the water as suspended particles absorb more of the sun's heat.
As a result, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations may decrease because warmer water carries less
dissolved oxygen than colder water. Turbidity is measured by an instrument called a nephelometric
turbidimeter, which expresses turbidity as NTU or TU. One TU is equivalent to 1 mg/litre silica in
suspension (Vanessa Fernandez Alvarez 2023).
COD: COD in water means chemical oxygen demand. It represents the amount of oxygen required to
decompose oxidizable compounds present in a waste water sample. COD is an important parameter of
water quality. To detect this, a special chemical (potassium dichromate in sulfuric acid solution) is used
in the water sample. The acceptable range of COD is 250 to 500 parts per million (PPM). COD test is
used to detect the amount of organic matter in waste water. COD testing can also test highly toxic waste
water for BOD testing. The higher the COD value of water, the more serious the pollution. COD testing

is also used to assess the impact of waste water on the environment (Nor Syamimi Musa and Wan
Azlina Ahmad 2010).
BOD: Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in water refers to the amount of dissolved oxygen required
by microorganisms to decompose organic matter present in water. This is a measure of the severity of
pollution. BOD measures the amount of organic matter present in water. The lower the BOD in the
water, the cleaner it will be. BOD in safe drinking water should be zero. If BOD is high, the need for
treatment will also be high. BOD is often used in wastewater treatment plants as an index of the degree
of organic pollution in water. The BOD value of moderately polluted rivers can be in the range of 2 to 8
mg/L. When the BOD value exceeds 8 mg/L, rivers can be considered seriously polluted (A B Abdullahi
et al., 2021).
TDS: TDS in water means total dissolved solids present in water. The amount of TDS in water is a
parameter to determine the quality of water. The amount of TDS in water is usually measured in
milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (PPM). According to the Bureau of Indian Standards
(BIS), the amount of TDS in water should not be more than 500 ppm. At the same time, according to the
World Health Organization (WHO), the amount of TDS in water should be less than 300 ppm. Water
with TDS more than 300 ppm is not considered potable. Due to high amount of TDS in water, water
becomes salty. When the amount of TDS in water is 65 to 95 ppm, water becomes sweet. However,
many important minerals are also removed from it. To reduce the amount of TDS in water, purification
systems like carbon filters and reverse osmosis (RO) are used (Mohammad Rafiqul Islam et al., 2016).
Electrical conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water is the ability to conduct electricity in water. It
is also called EC or specific conductivity. To measure the conductivity of water, a laboratory bench or
portable meter is used. The units for measuring the conductivity of water are: siemens per meter in SI,
milliohms per centimeter in CGS, micrograms per square centimeter.
Pure water is an insulator and has very low conductivity. The conductivity of distilled water is between
5.5 to 6 S/m. The conductivity of water increases due to the substances dissolved in water. Chemicals or
salts dissolved in water break down into positively and negatively charged ions. These ions become free
in water and conduct electricity. Water conductivity gives information about the purity and quality of
water. Rainfall, geology, evaporation, road salt, septic/landfill leachate, impervious surface runoff, and
agricultural runoff affect water conductivity (Yang Xianhong et al., (2021).
Hardness: The hardness of water is the total number of divalent ions present in a certain amount of
water is called hardness of water. Divalent ions such as calcium ion, magnesium ion, and Fe2 ion can be
found in water. The hardness of water is measured on a scale. To measure water hardness, the amount of
calcium carbonate is generally measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). On the basis of hardness of
water it is classified as follows: 0 to 60 mg/L is soft ~61 to 120 mg/L is moderately hard 121 More than
180 mg/L is considered hard. More than 180 mg/L is considered very hard due to the salts dissolved in
sea water. Normally the hardness of sea water is around 6,570 ppm (6.57 grams per liter) (Mohammad
Rafiqul Islam et al., 2016).

Iron: Important things about the amount of iron in water. Generally, the iron present in water is not
dangerous for health. The amount of iron in drinking water should be 0.3 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or
0.3 parts per million (ppm). If the amount of iron in water is high, the color of water becomes red or
brown. Due to excess iron content in water, it can cause skin diseases. Drinking iron-rich water can
affect the liver. This can cause jaundice, hair fall, kidney related problems. Most iron comes from food,
because the body cannot easily absorb iron from water. Method to find out the amount of iron in
water: If there is iron in the water, then when water is poured into the sink or tub, the water turns red or
brown. To find out the amount of iron in water, it is necessary to get water tested. Sodium forms water
soluble components such as halide, sulphate, nitrate, carboxylate, and carbonate (Rahman I et al., 2024).
Sodium
Sodium, when added to water, forms hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide. Sodium reacts with water and
gives an explosive reaction. A bright yellow flame is produced in this reaction. This reaction is
exothermic and energy giving in nature. Sodium catches fire due to reaction with water. Sodium salts are
usually isolated as solids by evaporation or precipitation with an organic antisolvent such as ethanol.
Sodium bismuthate (NaBiO 3), is insoluble in cold water and decomposes in hot water (Tassew Arega
2020).
Potassium hydroxide (KOH)
Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is formed by the reaction of potassium with water. This reaction can be
violently exothermic. Potassium permanganate is used to purify drinking water. It dissolves impurities in
water. Potassium permanganate is a purple-black crystalline salt. Its chemical formula is
KMnO4.Potassium permanganate is used as a strong oxidizing agent in the chemical industry and
laboratories. Potassium permanganate is also used as a medicine for dermatitis, for cleaning wounds,
and for general disinfection. Potassium chloride (KCl) is a naturally occurring potassium salt. It is used
as fertilizer. Potassium hydroxide is also called caustic potash. It is used in making liquid soap and
detergent (Tassew Arega 2020).
Nitrate: Nitrate in water is a naturally occurring compound that contains oxygen and nitrogen. It is
found in small quantities in water and soil. Nitrate has no color, taste, or odor in drinking water.High
levels of nitrate can lead to the disease Mithecoglobinaria. Due to this the body of the newborn baby
turns blue. Excess of nitrate in water is also a sign of biological pollution. Therefore, it is important to
check the water being used (Mary H. Ward et al., 2018).
Ammonia: ammonia in water has adverse effects on health. Ammonia is a colourless, pungent smelling
gas. Its chemical formula is NH3. It is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia dissolves in water
to form ammonium hydroxide solution. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the amount of
ammonia in water should not be more than 0.5 ppm. Due to high amount of ammonia in water, water
becomes unfit for drinking. Excessive amount of ammonia in water has adverse effects on
health. Ammonia is dangerous for health, but is not carcinogenic. If suffering from ammonia, problems

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g8wxz ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3067-184X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

like fever, cough, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, severe stomach pain, difficulty in breathing,
swelling of lips, difficulty in walking, restlessness and temporary blindness can occur.
Suffering from ammonia can damage lungs and vascular function (M Alamgir Hossain 2007).
Fluoride: According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the amount of fluoride in water should be 1 mg
per liter. According to the report of the World Health Organization, the amount of fluoride in water
should be half to one milligram per liter. Fluoride in excess quantity can harm health.
Excessive amounts of fluoride can cause white spots on the teeth, which is called dental fluorosis. This
problem affects children up to 8 years of age. Excessive amounts of fluoride can cause damage to bones
and joints, which is called skeletal fluorosis. Reverse Osmosis (RO) filtration can be used to avoid
fluoridated water. RO systems have a semipermeable membrane that separates water molecules from
contaminants. Fluoride is a mineral found naturally in many foods and water. Fluoride helps prevent
tooth decay (Stephen Peckham 2014).
E. coli bacteria: E. Drinking water infected with E. coli bacteria can cause intestinal infection. This
infection can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes bloody stools. E. When infected with E.
coli bacteria, urinary tract infection can also occur. E. If infected with E. coli bacteria, serious diseases
like food poisoning or pneumonia can also occur. E. If infected with E. coli bacteria, serious problems
can also occur in blood and kidneys (Stephen T. Odonkor and Joseph K. Ampofo 2013).
Result and Discussion
The drinking water quality is an important part of environment, which has a great impact on the human
health. The basis for the drinking water safety assurance is a foundation for the prevention and control of
diseases occurring due to poor quality of water. In an internal level WHO has given the guidelines,
which involves various national and international authorities as well as international agencies.
As the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) India classifies the surface water based on its designated
best use (Table-1 and Table-2). This classification helps determine the suitability of water for various
purposes such as drinking, bathing, industrial use, and agriculture. The categories include:
1.

Literature Survey: Summary of few previous studies conducted on various rivers:
Patel et al. (2013) directed an appraisal of the occasional variety in water nature of the Mahi Stream at
Sindhrot, Vadodara in 2013. They estimated different boundaries including conductivity utilizing a
conductivity meter, pH with a pH meter, alkalinity through titration, turbidity with a nephelometric
technique, smelling salts nitrogen by means of spectrophotometry, chloride utilizing argentometric

restricting untreated sewage and industrial effluents, penalizing solid waste disposal in rivers, and
promoting wastewater treatment, reuse, and recycling. Continuous monitoring of river water quality is
essential to manage future changes effectively.
RIVER POLLUTION IN INDIA
In India water pollution reached at hypercritical place. Now days in India most of the rivers are
considered as polluted. It is given by national environmental engineering research institute
(NEERI) Nagpur, approx 70% Indian river water are considered polluted (Martin, 1998).
Many Scientist considered River Ganga as polluted river after studying its parameters Mirzapur by
Shukla (1989) and shukla et al. in 1989 studied and shows the River Ganga polluted in Varanasi.
The both study were done and culminate into a common conclusion which shows that the physicochemical characteristics of Ganga River water is continuously decreasing and till now following the
same track. The Bacteriological study of Ganga river pollution was studied by Shukla et al. (1992) and
the Varuna River studied by Shukla et al. (1988). The reports finds that the presence of a large number
of microorganisms including pathogenic and non-pathogenic are very high and even in their excess
limit. Sewage water quality that is merging into the river Yamuna was studied and reported by Sharma
et al. (1981).
The Yamuna river water quality analyzed by Sangu et al. (1984) and further by Mohan et al. (1965) by
Okhla, whereas The bacterial analysis of Yamuna River at Delhi is done by Kaushik and Prasad (1964).
After the study it is clear that River Yamuna is more poorer than Ganga in many cities. The production
of blue-green algae study of River Gomati is reported by Saxena and Prasad (1980).
INTERNATIONAL STUDIES IN RIVER POLLUTION
Likewise studies conducted on National level, in similar way the study conducted at international level
also. The quality of River Raisin is analyzed in Canada and Reichert (2001) by and Watelet and Johnson
(1999) in river Glatt in Switzerland. The macrophytes study of Nile River chemistry is conducted by
Obeid and Chadwick (1964). The Gibbs (1972) analyzed the River Amazon Chemistry that highly
shows the microbiological aspects by Rai and Hill (1984). Eutrophication and nutrient pollution study of
coastal river in Israel conducted by Herut et al. (2000). Physico-chemical analyses report of lake
Mellwaine in Rhodesia is prepared by Marshall and Falconer (1973).
The stream pollution in general streams is analyzed by Ellis (1937). The study of the river Aliakman in
Greece with Multidisciplinary study aspects is conducted by Lazaridou et al. (1999). Study of the
chemistry of River Odzi at Zimbabwe is reported by Jannalagadda and Mhere (2001). The study of river
Niger is conducted by Imevbore (1978) similarly.
All the literatures above analyzed and reported that shows that the problem of water pollution only to
India in India but another countries even the complete globe is struggling with water problems with its
effects on human beings and another organisms too.
