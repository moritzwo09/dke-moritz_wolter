1. Abstract
Due to the world turning away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, electrical energy
is becoming increasingly important. Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are promising contenders in
the realm of electrochemical energy storage. While lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have long
dominated the market with their high energy density and durability, sustainability concerns stem
from the environmental impact of raw material extraction and manufacturing processes, and
performance-related drawbacks include limited lifespan, safety hazards like thermal runaway,
and challenges in recycling. AIBs stand out for their superior sustainability and theoretical
capacity, powered by the usage of trivalent aluminum ions (Al³⁺), due to a higher abundance in
Earth’s crust and a well-established recycling infrastructure. Despite the advantages of AIBs in
sustainability and theoretical capacity, their widespread commercial use has been hindered by
certain electrochemical limitations, such as challenges in achieving competitive energy density
and addressing issues related to the efficient cycling of trivalent aluminum ions. This paper
delves into the merits of AIBs, exploring their potential to surpass LIBs and serve as the leading
battery technology of the future.
2. How Lithium and Aluminum ion Batteries work
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) dominate the battery market as they provide high energy density
and long cyclability, meaning it can endure numerous charge and discharge cycles while
retaining its capacity and performance, to enable an increasingly electrified world. However,
they have significant disadvantages compared to other electrochemical systems in terms of
overall sustainability and performance. Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) show promising
characteristics that suggest they could potentially outperform lithium-ion batteries in terms of
sustainability and theoretical capacity due to their natural abundance and trivalent nature.
To accurately compare LIBs and AIBs it is necessary to understand how they operate. A typical
AIB consists of an aluminum anode, a cathode (often made of materials such as graphite), a
separator, an electrolyte, and two current collectors. AIB batteries operate on the principle of the
reversible electrochemical reaction of aluminum with oxygen to form aluminum oxide. The
aluminum in the anode serves as the charge carrier, a role similar to the lithium ions in lithiumion batteries. As the aluminum ions are positively charged, they migrate from the anode to the
cathode through the electrolyte and separator. This migration process creates free electrons in the
anode, culminating in a charge at the positive current collector. When discharging, aluminum at
the anode loses electrons (is oxidized) to become aluminum ions. These ions then migrate
through an electrolyte towards the cathode where they are received, while the electrons travel

through the external circuit to do useful work as shown in Figure 1(b). During charging, the
process is reversed: aluminum ions leave the cathode, travel back to the anode, and regain
electrons to become metallic aluminum again1,2.
A lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery functions based on the movement of lithium ions between the
anode and the cathode as shown in Figure 1(a). The most common setup involves a graphite
anode and a metal oxide cathode, with a lithium salt electrolyte in between. During discharge,
lithium ions move from the graphite anode, through the electrolyte, and intercalate into the metal
oxide cathode. At the same time, electrons released from the anode travel through the external
circuit, providing power to devices, before rejoining the lithium ions at the cathode. The
charging process reverses this movement, with lithium ions deintercalating from the cathode and
returning to the anode3.

AIBs utilize trivalent aluminum ions, which possess a +3 charge, in contrast to the monovalent
lithium ions in LIBs with a +1 charge. This disparity in charge magnitude greatly influences
energy storage, conductivity, and ion mobility in the respective electrolytes. Trivalent ions, due
to their capacity to convey more charge per ion than monovalent ions, may exhibit elevated
charge/discharge potentials4. Structurally, LIBs intercalate (insert between crystal layers)
between anode and cathode materials without significant structural alterations, AIBs
predominantly witness the plating of aluminum ions onto, or their stripping from, the metal
anode, bypassing the typical intercalation5. Furthermore, on average aluminum costs $2.55 per
kilogram while lithium costs $18.75 per kilogram6. The cost of Li is >7x higher than aluminum,
making this cost difference compelling at large scale and because of this, news articles praise
aluminum batteries as "dirt cheap" compared to li-ion batteries7. Lastly, while LIBs incorporate

various metal oxide cathodes, AIBs frequently adopt carbon-based materials like graphite,
underscoring the distinct material requirements and possibilities each battery system presents4,5.
While electrochemical operation, involving the efficiency of the conversion of chemical energy
to electrical energy through redox reactions, is a large part of choosing the right battery for a
particular application, factors such as sustainability, safety, and cost should also play a role in
battery selection. Even though both the aluminum and the lithium that are used in the batteries
are naturally occurring metals in Earth’s crust, many components make one metal far more
consumer-friendly and environmentally favorable than the other such as the vast difference in
abundance. Additionally, a large amount of research is being done currently to match the
electrochemical performance of aluminum ion batteries to that of the current industry
standard. Simply put, the emergence of aluminum-ion batteries could redefine the economic
landscape of energy storage. Delivering comparable performance to lithium-ion batteries but at a
significantly reduced cost, this innovation has the potential to broaden access to advanced energy
solutions, impacting not just consumers but entire industries. Exploring the process of how
resources are extracted and the life cycles of both these metals can help with fairly comparing
them.
3. Comparison of Resource Extraction
One of the main reasons for the high price of lithium and low price of aluminum is their
abundance in Earth’s crust. Aluminum is the third most abundant element after oxygen and
silicon. Lithium metal only makes up about 0.002% of Earth’s crust by mass while aluminum
makes up nearly 8% of Earth’s crust8. This massive difference shows how rare lithium reserves
are on Earth and further demonstrates that it is not a sustainable solution. Using a more abundant
material could lead to a more stable and potentially lower-cost supply chain from miner to
manufacturer to consumer. Furthermore, the well-established extraction processes could make
aluminum-ion batteries more cost-effective than lithium-ion batteries as these systems have been
refined over the centuries to make aluminum mining exceptionally efficient.
Other than abundance, mining metals takes a toll on our planet. The extraction of lithium
requires significant water usage, which could lead to environmental concerns in water-scarce
regions. According to Wenjuan Liu et. al., brine extraction in areas like the Lithium Triangle and
hard rock mining in regions like Australia contribute to water stress, impacting local
ecosystems9. Brine extraction may use anywhere from around 500 to 5,000 cubic meters of water
per ton of lithium produced, depending on factors such as brine concentration, extraction
efficiency, and local operational practice and estimates suggest that water usage in hard rock
mining can range from approximately 1 to 2.5 cubic meters per ton of lithium
produced9. Moreover, the environmental benefits of aluminum battery adoption do not stop at
mining. Aluminum metal can be recycled 50-70 times while lithium can be recycled less than

once10. The money saved through mining a more abundant metal can be invested into recycling
plants to repurpose old aluminum batteries.
According to a paper written by Hubertus Bardt, aluminum is not classified as critical when
considering the reserves-to-production ratio, political implications, and supply risks11. One
reason for this is the various sources of aluminum. Naturally occurring aluminum is not usually
found as a pure metal but rather in the form aluminum silicates. To produce the pure form of
aluminum suitable for various applications, it must be extracted either from minerals like bauxite
or via recycling from scrap. According to a study by Ostojic et al., one kilogram of pure
aluminum can be extracted from 4 kg of bauxite12. Additionally, the concentrations of aluminum
in raw materials are twice that of the concentrations of lithium. Using this approximation, one
can deduce that less soil needs to be displaced when mining aluminum than when mining the
same mass of lithium. Furthermore, over twice the amount of aluminum atoms can be sourced
from 1 kg of raw material as compared to lithium, underscoring the efficiency of using aluminum
in batteries.
Even though aluminum is abundant in the Earth’s crust, the recycling process determines the life
cycle and overall sustainability of the material. Infrastructure around aluminum has been
globally established for some time now, and every continent has its own resources for mining,
producing, and recycling of the metal13,14. A study conducted by Fathi Habashi in 2003 reported
significant advancements in reducing the energy consumption of the aluminum production
process by up to 95%. This means that in today’s world, 35% of the global aluminum demand is
provided by recycled aluminum compared to 5% of lithium batteries1,10.
Recycling and manufacturing process to produce aluminum does not come without an
environmental impact. The aluminum industry accounts for about 1% of greenhouse gas
emissions split across two categories. Direct emissions from the aluminum production process
account for 40% and the remaining 60% are indirect emissions from electricity generation15. The
carbon footprint of producing 1 kg of raw aluminum is between 5 to 40 kg of CO2. Therefore, it
is important to consider renewable energy processes as aluminum production grows to
counterbalance these carbon emissions. An example of ongoing efforts to counterbalance is that
most aluminum production facilities are strategically located next to hydro-electric power
stations due to the high energy demand16.
As per a study into the extractive metallurgy of aluminum, the production of 1 kg of aluminum
requires temperatures around 1,000°C and an energy input of between 9 to 12 kWh, with process
efficiencies ranging from 85 to 95%. On the other hand, the production of lithium demands even
higher temperatures, up to 1,150°C10. Both metals are produced by a fused-salt electrolysis
method, but aluminum's production consumes significantly less electrical energy than lithium's,
especially when weighing the other factors such as the gravimetric or volumetric capacity of
each metal. Table 1 summarizes the production requirements and parameters discussed.

4. Electrochemical disadvantages of Aluminum
Although aluminum is a far more sustainable metal than lithium, the main factor preventing the
widespread adoption of aluminum-ion batteries and replacement of lithium-ion batteries is the
superiority in electrochemical performance. There are a few challenges that AIBs face before
they can replace LIBs on a larger scale and be adopted in the long term. One crucial
consideration is energy density and voltage: the potential difference in a battery originates from
the differential electrochemical potential between its anode and cathode. Notably, the standard
AIB design currently exhibits a lower voltage than its LIB counterpart, leading to a diminished
energy density, a vital metric for applications like electric vehicles where the balance of range
and weight is paramount. Another challenge stems from aluminum's trivalent nature, which
emits three electrons upon ionization which complicates the ion's intercalation into cathode
materials1. On the contrary, LIBs use a monovalent lithium ion and its well-researched and
optimized cathode materials like lithium cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate. The search for a
suitable electrolyte that efficiently handles Al3+ ions and remains stable across the battery's
operational voltage poses a significant challenge. A further limitation resides in the discharge
rate of AIBs. Due to the inherent complexities associated with the movement of trivalent Al3+
ions compared to monovalent Li+ ions, AIBs currently struggle to achieve the rapid energy
release rates seen in LIBs, making them less suitable for high-demand applications. Moreover,
AIBs do not match LIBs performance for cycle life and long-term stability, especially under
fluctuating temperature and usage conditions17.
However, the push for Al-ion innovation is not without its reasons such as its sustainability and
safety benefits along with certain electrochemical performance metrics. Furthermore, the Al-ion's
resilience against damage and reduced risk of hazards like thermal runaway paves the way for
safer energy storage solutions. Al-ion batteries are less prone to the formation of dendrites,
unwanted growths that can cause short circuits in a battery. Additionally, aluminum's superior
thermal conductivity facilitates more efficient heat dissipation, reducing the risk of overheating
and thermal runaway, a critical safety concern in battery technology. The robust compatibility of
Al-ion batteries with stable electrolytes further enhances their safety by mitigating the potential
for chemical reactions that could compromise the battery's integrity. Moreover, the inherent
stability of aluminum as a material contributes to the overall durability and resilience of these
batteries. All in all, although Al-ion batteries currently trail behind Li-ion in certain performance
aspects, their innate benefits, and the possibility of overcoming present challenges make them a
real candidate to replace Li-ion batteries.
5. Improvements to Electrochemical Performance
Scientists have understood the areas that need to be improved upon in AIBs. Specifically,
scientists have developed the “Molten AlCl3/urea electrolyte” AIB18, the “Super long-life CMK3” AIB19, the “High Coulombic Efficiency Aluminum-Graphite” AIB20, and the “Graphene film
3H3C Ultrafast Quarter-Million Life cycle” AIB21. The following four battery technologies are

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wnt0j ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-9133-9239 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

proprietary AIB systems that each have a unique characteristic that improves performance of
general AIBs to match or even outperform current state-of-the-art LIBs as seen in Figure 2.
Two main aspects of electrochemical performance that must be improved in Al-ion batteries are
cycle life and discharge rate. One recently proposed advancement to improve cyclability is a
molten aluminum chloride-urea graphite battery. This battery improves the mechanism of
aluminum ions migrating between their anode and cathode during the charging and discharging
phases, using a unique electrolyte made of molten AlCl3/urea. When charging, the anode, made
of aluminum, undergoes oxidation to release trivalent aluminum ions (Al3+). As these ions
traverse the electrolyte to the graphite cathode, they combine with chloride ions to form AlCl4ions. These ions then insert themselves between the graphite layers of the cathode. During
discharge, the AlCl4- ions exit the graphite layers and as they approach the aluminum anode,
release an aluminum ion. This ion then assimilates three electrons, reverting to its original
metallic form. The performance improvement is achieved with a specific AlCl3 to urea ratio of
1.5 in the electrolyte and at an operational temperature of approximately 120°C, allowing the
cationic species [AlCl2(urea)+ to move with fewer losses. However, high temperature batteries
pose management challenges as they may require an external power supply, which could be a
potential drawback of this advancement. These conditions not only ensure efficient ionic
movement but also stave off undesired side reactions. While this elevated temperature might
raise concerns about the safety of battery operation, it is essential to note that the effectiveness of
the battery system relies on these conditions, and it is crucial to implement appropriate safety
measures and thermal management strategies. The battery touts a high specific capacity,
demonstrating that it can store substantial energy relative to its weight. This, combined with its
exceptional rate capability and longevity (with notable capacity retention even after 500 cycles),
renders it a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage, especially when juxtaposed
against traditional Al-ion batteries with pricier electrolytes18.
To further improve the cyclability of aluminum-ion batteries, the “Super long life aluminum
battery” has been proposed as a potential successor to traditional lithium-ion batteries. This
battery features a volumetric capacity reaching up to 8046 mAh cm^−3. This metric signifies the
immense energy these batteries can store within a confined space, making them ideal for
compact electronic devices. Also, by introducing CMK-3 (mesoporous carbon), an ordered
mesoporous carbon, as an efficient and commercially available cathode, this chemistry can reach
high levels of cyclability, exhibiting over 36,000 charge/discharge cycles with negligible
degradation. A significant highlight of CMK-3 lies in its architecture; the high surface area and
structured pores provide rapid pathways for ion movement, thereby enhancing the battery's rate
capabilities. Similar to the molten aluminum chloride chemistry, CMK-3 allows for intercalation
of Al-ions on the anode side. have verified this mechanism, revealing how these anions interact
with CMK-3's structure to ensure consistent and robust battery performance. Packing an energy
punch, the Al/CMK-3 battery showcases an energy density nearing 45 Wh kg^−1, competitive
with several mainstream battery technologies. Even better, unlike their lithium-ion counterparts,

which are notorious for safety issues, including fire hazards, this Al-ion battery boasts a high
safety profile19.
Discharge rate and Coulombic efficiency go hand in hand. This is why the innovation of the high
CE aluminum-ion battery is a promising improvement for the discharge rate problem of Al-ion
batteries. This battery technology works by utilizing a novel electrolyte made from a blend of
AlCl3 and urea, formulated in a 1.3:1 molar ratio. This battery operates using aluminum, as the
anode and graphite as the cathode. Electrochemically, the battery exhibits distinct voltage
plateaus around 1.9 and 1.5 V, with an average discharge of 1.73 V. These clear voltage plateaus
offer consistent and predictable energy delivery stages, simplifying battery management and
ensuring more stable performance during operation. What sets this battery apart is its outstanding
CE of approximately 99.7% and a commendable cathode capacity of about 73 mAh g−1 at a
current density of 100 mA g−1. Compared to LIBs, this aluminum-ion prototype presents several
advantages. Furthermore, during its operation, in-situ Raman spectroscopy elucidated the
chloroaluminate anion's intercalation and deintercalation within the graphite during the battery's
charge and discharge cycles17. This indicates the formation of a stage 2 graphite intercalation
compound when fully charged. Importantly, this battery offers an improved safety profile since
its electrolyte is nonflammable, addressing one of the primary concerns with LIBs. Given these
attributes, the aluminum-ion battery technology offers a promising solution for future highperformance, cost-effective energy storage needs20.
The challenge with aluminum-ion batteries has traditionally been their lower voltage in
comparison to lithium-ion batteries. However, by focusing on enhancing the discharge rate, the
challenges of reduced voltage can be offset to some extent. The ultrafast all-climate aluminumgraphene battery is a promising solution to this problem. At the heart of the design is the
graphene film cathode with a "trihigh tricontinuous (3H3C) design”. The electrochemical
operation relies on the movement of ions between the anode and the cathode. In this battery, the
graphene cathode, orientation, and channeling (3H), facilitates efficient ion movement with its
continuous electron-conducting matrix, ion-diffusion highway, and electroactive mass (3C). By
capitalizing on this efficient ion transport, the battery can discharge at much higher current rates,
thus compensating for its lower voltage by delivering the required power in a shorter time frame.
This structure allows the battery to achieve a high specific capacity of around 120 mAh g−1 even
at ultrahigh current densities and display exceptional retention after a quarter-million cycles.
Compared to lithium-ion batteries, this aluminum-graphene battery boasts several advantages:
the aluminum anode's three-electron redox property provides high capacity, the non-flammability
of materials enhances safety, and the unique graphene structure supports fast charging and stable
cycling. Furthermore, the battery functions efficiently across a wide temperature range, from -40
to 120°C, and displays remarkable flexibility, essential attributes for all-climate wearable
devices. The graphene's high crystalline nature and the designed interconnected channels ensure
rapid ion diffusion, enabling the battery's impressive rate capability and cycle life. By
strategically increasing the discharge rate, the aluminum-graphene battery can effectively

lithium-ion battery21.

6. Applications

Lithium-ion batteries have been used as a universal solution for electrochemical energy storage.
However, specific Al-ion battery chemistries have unique advantages, which may be suitable for
individual applications. Notably, Table 2 outlines key metrics for Al-ion batteries in comparison
to lithium-ion counterparts, offering insights into their performance across crucial parameters for
specific applications. The top three uses for rechargeable batteries—electric vehicles (EVs),
portable devices (PDs), and energy storage systems (ESS)—each have distinct requirements, and
the ability of Al-ion batteries to tailor their strengths to these needs makes them an intriguing
contender in the evolving landscape of electrochemical energy storage solutions24. As technology
advances, the diversified landscape of battery options fosters a more nuanced approach to
selecting the most suitable power source for specific applications, promoting efficiency, safety,
and sustainability.

TABLE 2: CONSISTS OF THE CURRENT ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE METRICS REQUIRED BY A BATTERY FOR ELECTRIC
VEHICLES , PERSONAL DEVICES , AND ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS 25–28

The Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries with CMK-3 Cathode stand out as the premier
consideration for Energy Storage Systems (ESS) due to a combination of performance and safety
metrics. Their remarkable cycle life, reaching over 36,000 charge/discharge cycles, ensures that
these batteries can deliver sustained performance for years, making them ideal for large-scale
storage systems that experience frequent charge and discharge cycles. This longevity is coupled
with an intrinsic high safety profile, reducing the inherent risks like fire hazards associated with
many traditional battery systems, especially vital for installations near populated areas.
Furthermore, the battery's volumetric capacity, marked at an impressive 8046 mAh cm^−3,
highlights its ability to store vast amounts of energy in a limited space, optimizing real estate for
large installations. Despite their notable advantages, these batteries are not currently widely used
for large-scale storage, mainly because they are still in the early stages of development and
commercialization. Established technologies like lithium-ion batteries, with their proven
reliability, mature supply chains, and extensive integration into grid-scale applications, currently
dominate the market for large-scale energy storage solutions. As the CMK-3 Cathode
Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries undergo further testing, standardization, and increased
commercial viability, their adoption in the energy storage sector may see growth in the future19.
When it comes to Electric Vehicles (EVs), the demands for a reliable and high-performing
battery are paramount. The ideal choice for EVs would be the advanced Aluminum-Graphene
Battery, known for its exceptional rate capabilities and safety profile. With a high specific

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wnt0j ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-9133-9239 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

capacity of around 120 mAh g⁻¹, it ensures that EVs can cover substantial distances on a single
charge. Additionally, its robust cycle life, showing negligible degradation even after a quartermillion cycles, makes it well-suited for the rigorous use expected in EVs, ensuring longevity.
The non-flammable materials in its construction enhance safety, addressing concerns related to
fire hazards, which is of utmost importance in high-capacity batteries. Furthermore, its ability to
operate efficiently across a wide temperature range from -40°C to 120°C ensures that it can cater
to the diverse environments that EVs may encounter. Considering the need for rapid charging
and the unique requirements of EVs, the Aluminum-Graphene Battery emerges as a promising
solution for the future of electric transportation21.
In the realm of Portable Devices (PDs), lightweight, long-lasting, and safe battery technology is
key. The Aluminum-Ion Battery with High CE stands out as an excellent candidate for these
applications. While portable devices may not require the same energy density as EVs, they do
need to be efficient and offer extended use on a single charge. This battery's high CE of
approximately 99.7% ensures that a significant portion of the stored energy is effectively
utilized, resulting in prolonged device operation. Moreover, its impressive cathode capacity of
about 73 mAh g⁻¹ at a current density of 100 mA g⁻¹ allows PDs to run for extended periods
without frequent recharging. The non-flammable electrolyte addresses safety concerns, which are
particularly crucial for devices that people carry with them daily. Overall, the Aluminum-Ion
Battery with High CE is a well-rounded choice for powering the next generation of portable
devices20.
7. Conclusion and Outlook:
In conclusion, the comparison between Aluminum-Ion Batteries and Lithium-Ion Batteries
highlights an interesting relationship of advantages and challenges. AIBs, powered by trivalent
aluminum ions and sustainable sourcing, hold immense promise for transforming the landscape
of electrochemical energy storage. These batteries address critical environmental concerns and
resource limitations associated with LIBs. The diverse array of AIB chemistries—from molten
aluminum chloride-urea graphite batteries to aluminum-graphene variants—demonstrates
ongoing innovation to overcome electrochemical limitations.
While LIBs have long reigned supreme due to their high energy density and proven reliability,
the scarcity of lithium and its environmentally impactful extraction processes necessitate
alternative solutions.
AIBs, abundant in the Earth’s crust and reinforced by robust recycling infrastructure, present a
compelling case for sustainability. Their safety advantages, including resilience against damage
and reduced risk of hazards like thermal runaway, further enhance their appeal as safer energy
storage options.
Looking ahead, the future of battery technology lies in the hands of AIBs. As research continues,
we anticipate breakthroughs in cycle life, discharge rates, and overall performance. Innovations
