Abstract

25

Background: Persistent, Mobile and Toxic (PMT), or very Persistent and very Mobile (vPvM)

26

substances are a wide class of chemicals that are recalcitrant to degradation, easily transported,

27

and potentially harmful to humans and the environment. Due to their persistence and mobility,

28

these substances are often widespread in the environment once emitted, particularly in water

29

resources, causing increased challenges during water treatment processes. Some PMT/vPvM

30

substances such as GenX and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid have been identified as substances

31

of very high concern (SVHCs) under the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and

32

Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation. With hundreds to thousands of potential PMT/vPvM

33

substances yet to be assessed and managed, effective and efficient approaches that avoid a

34

case-by-case assessment and prevent regrettable substitution are necessary to achieve the

35

European Union's zero-pollution goal for a non-toxic environment by 2050.

36

Main: Substance grouping has helped global regulation of some highly hazardous chemicals, e.g.,

37

through the Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention. This article explores the potential

38

of grouping strategies for identifying, assessing and managing PMT/vPvM substances. The aim

39

is to facilitate early identification of lesser-known or new substances that potentially meet

40

PMT/vPvM criteria, prompt additional testing, avoid regrettable use or substitution, and integrate

41

into existing risk management strategies. Thus, this article provides an overview of PMT/vPvM

42

substances and reviews the definition of PMT/vPvM criteria and various lists of PMT/vPvM

43

substances available. It covers the current definition of groups, compares the use of substance

44

grouping for hazard assessment and regulation, and discusses the advantages and

45

disadvantages of grouping substances for regulation. The article then explores strategies for

46

grouping PMT/vPvM substances, including read-across, structural similarity and commonly

47

retained moieties, as well as the potential application of these strategies using cheminformatics

48

to predict P, M and T properties for selected examples.

49

Conclusion: Effective substance grouping can accelerate the assessment and management of

50

PMT/vPvM substances, especially for substances that lack information. Advances to read-across

51

methods and cheminformatics tools are needed to support efficient and effective chemical

52

management, preventing broad entry of hazardous chemicals into the global market and favouring

53

safer and more sustainable alternatives.

Background

55

In 2019 water pollution was estimated to cause 1.4 million premature deaths globally [1].

56

Improving water quality by reducing pollution is also defined as one of the tasks in the Sustainable

57

Development Goals [2]. Meanwhile, the number of known chemicals that are in use is increasing

58

dramatically. Over 350,000 chemicals and mixtures have been registered in the global market

59

over the past 50 years [3], while the largest chemical databases contain over 100 million

60

chemicals, with PubChem [4] and the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry containing 116

61

million [5] and 219 million [6] chemicals, respectively, as of January 2023. Chemical production

62

and pollution are outpacing global assessment capacity, posing more risks to human health,

63

wildlife, and the environment [7, 8]. In 2021, about 224.8 and 86.4 million tonnes of chemicals

64

hazardous to human health and the environment, respectively, were consumed in the European

65

Union (EU) [9]. Some of these chemicals are persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substances or

66

very persistent and very mobile (vPvM) substances, collectively referred to as PMT/vPvM

67

substances.

68

PMT/vPvM substances have been listed by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on

69

Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) as one of the 14 emerging problems that

70

could impact human health or the environment [10]. Recently, the EU Chemicals, Labelling and

71

Packaging (CLP) regulation (1272/2008) introduced the new hazard classes PMT and vPvM, as

72

well as defined criteria for

73

presented below in Figure 1. These substances do not degrade in the environment over an

74

appreciable timescale and are easily transported through water and aquatic ecosystems due to

75

poor sorption to soil and sediments [12–14]. PMT/vPvM substances can be found in a wide range

76

of applications and sources, including in industrial processes, fire-fighting foams, and consumer

77

products such as food, cosmetics and furniture [15]. They can cause long-term harm to humans

78

and the environment and are also costly and difficult to remove from drinking water [16–19].

79

PMT/vPvM substances have been suggested to have an equivalent level of concern as persistent,

80

bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB)

81

substances. GenX and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), both classified as PMT/vPvM

82

substances by the German Environmental Agency (UBA) [20] (but not yet officially classified

83

under the CLP Regulation), have been identified as substances of very high concern (SVHCs)

84

under the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals,

85

REACH, regulation (EC 1907/2006) [12]. The commonality between PMT/vPvM and PBT/vPvB

PMT/vPvM substances based on chemical properties [11], as

86

substances is their elevated potential for long-lasting and long-range exposure when released to

87

the environment in substantial quantities. Their difference is related to the exposure pathway, with

88

PMT/vPvM substances likely to be first monitored in water resources where they are most likely

89

to accumulate and PBT/vPvB substances being first monitored in the food supply, humans and

90

living organisms. Though this was not stated within the CLP regulation [11], it may be assumed

91

this was introduced due to concerns from enhanced exposure potential leading to unforeseen

92

effects, be they odour, aesthetic, geophysical, economical or other than established toxicological

93

criteria. As an example, REACH Annex 1, Section 0.10 refers to “particular effects, such as ozone

94

depletion, photochemical ozone creation potential, strong odour and tainting, for which […] the

95

risks associated with such effects shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis”. Considering these

96

concerns, a key consideration for vP substances is to further check if they exhibit enhanced

97

exposure-related properties (vB or vM), toxicological or other hazards, following the current

98

regulatory approaches.

99

Furthermore, due to the high mobility of PMT/vPvM substances, many of them can break through

100

artificial barriers in wastewater treatment plants, including granular activated carbon filtration and

101

ultrafiltration systems, posing challenges for removal and remediation [12, 21]. These substances

102

can be further transported through natural media such as soils, riverbanks, aquifers and

103

groundwater, making them hard to contain and remove from the environment. As such, these

104

substances are problematic in drinking water, and many are detected frequently in European

105

surface waters [12]. For example, 1,4-dioxin was found in Bavarian surface waters [22] and

106

melamine in the Netherlands, France and Belgium [23].

107

Approximately 2% of identifiable unique chemicals registered under REACH are considered to

108

meet the PMT/vPvM criteria (259 out of 13405 unique, identifiable chemicals registered under

109

REACH); however, the true number is likely higher due to data gaps related to persistent, mobility

110

or toxicity, with a potential maximum of 28% of REACH registered substances (3677 out of 13405

111

substances) [24]. Developing and applying substance grouping strategies is one way to potentially

112

identify and manage PMT/vPvM substances more effectively. There are two main motivations for

113

a substance grouping approach. The first is to expedite hazard assessments related to the large

114

number of substances being introduced to the global chemical market. The second is to avoid

115

regrettable substitution caused by drop-in substitution [25], where one substance is replaced by

116

another with similar hazardous properties and effects [26]. Thus, this paper aims to explore how

117

grouping strategies can be generally developed and used to identify, assess and manage new,

118

emerging and well-known PMT/vPvM substances. To provide context, the paper first provides an

119

overview of PMT/vPvM substances, including scoping the numbers of substances covered by

120

existing definitions, reviewing previous successful grouping strategies, and determining the

121

relevance of grouping strategies in the context of PMT/vPvM substances while exploring the

122

future efforts required to achieve this effectively. The principle aim of this article is not specifically

123

targeting the ECHA technical guidance for PMT/vPvM substance assessment, but rather it is on

124

how grouping strategies can be used to screen, assess, regulate and manage groups of

125

PMT/vPvM substances more efficiently.

126

Methods

127

Definition of key terms

128

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines a chemical substance as

129

“matter of constant composition best characterized by the entities (molecules, formula, units,

130

atoms) it is composed of. Physical properties such as density, refractive index, electric

131

conductivity, melting point etc. characterize the chemical substance” [27]. The term “substance”

132

in this article is used in this context. Databases also refer to chemical entities as compounds and

133

substances, but the context may be different. PubChem, for instance, define these as “a

134

substance is a chemical sample description provided by a single source and a compound is a

135

normalized chemical structure representation found in one or more contributed substances” [28].

136

Since this article later refers to calculations performed on PubChem queries, “compound” in this

137

article refers to a chemical that fulfils the definition of a compound according to PubChem with a

138

unique PubChem Compound Identifier (CID). A mixture, according to IUPAC, is a “portion of

139

matter consisting of two or more chemical substances called constituents” [29]. Mixtures can be

140

simple (e.g., xylene is a mixture of three isomers, o-xylene, m-xylene and p-xylene) or complex

141

(e.g., C9-C14 alcohols, or mineral oils). The latter are often referred to as “substances of Unknown

142

or Variable composition, Complex reaction products or Biological origin” (UVCBs) [30].

143

A group of substances is defined by REACH as substances that have “(1) a common functional

144

group; (2) the common precursors and/or the likelihood of common breakdown products via

145

physical and biological processes, which result in structurally similar chemicals; or (3) a constant

146

pattern in the changing of the potency of the properties across the category.” (REACH Regulation

147

EC No 1907/2006, Annex XI, Section 1.5) [31]. In other words, the term “group” and “category”

148

are used interchangeably in this article. As an example, two widely regulated groups of

149

substances that fulfil all three aspects of grouping substances in the REACH regulation are

150

dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans) [32] and

151

polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) [33], which are composed of about 210 [34] and 209 individual

152

congeners, respectively [35].

153

Literature analysis

154

To obtain relevant literature to underpin the arguments in this paper, a comprehensive literature

155

search spanning both policy-related documents (e.g., regulations, guidelines, analysis, dossiers)

156

and scientific literature was conducted using keywords like "persistent, mobile and toxic", “very

157

persistent very mobile”, "substance grouping" and "chemical regulation" in electronic databases

158

such as PubMed and Google Scholar, while filtering for relevance. As the study focus area was

159

mainly the European Union, recent policy documents in the EU and United Nations were

160

considered most relevant due to the greater activity on PMT/vPvM substances, while detailed

161

policy analysis of areas outside the European Union was considered out of scope. Scientific

162

studies focused on grouping strategies for the assessment and management of substances,

163

including chemicals, pollutants, and contaminants that exhibit persistence and mobility in the

164

environment were also considered relevant. Backward citation searching was also conducted

165

from the list of relevant articles to identify additional studies that may have been overlooked during

166

the electronic search. By systematically executing the search strategy across multiple databases

167

and supplementing it with hand-searching reference lists, a comprehensive selection of relevant

168

literature with findings focused on the topic was compiled and considered in this article.

169

Cheminformatics analysis

170

For cheminformatics analysis, the search functions available in the PubChem database [4] were

171

used to obtain the structural and substructural data of compounds of interest. The OPERA

172

ReadyBiodegradable model version 2.9 [36] was used to predict the persistence of compounds,

173

along with the KOCWIN model version 2.00 [37] to predict the mobility (log Koc values) of the

174

compounds from the PubChemLite for Exposomics dataset, Version 1.27.0 [38] and other subsets

175

of compounds extracted from PubChem. Further details of other datasets used can be found in

176

the "availability of data and material" section below. The toxicity predictions were performed with

177

MS2Tox version 0.3.2 [39]. Data processing was performed in R version 4.3.1 [40] using the

178

packages Tidyverse version 2.0.0 [41, 42] and ggplot2 version 3.4.3 [43, 44] for data

179

transformation and plotting, and RChemMass 0.1.28 [45] for obtaining the exact mass before

180

MS2Tox calculations. Additional information is given in the “Cheminformatics challenges in

181

grouping PMT/vPvM substances” section below.

182

Overview of PMT/vPvM Substances

183

Assessment of the number of substances being introduced to the global chemical market that

184

may be PMT/vPvM substances requires a clear set of criteria and the ability to scale the

185

application of these criteria to large numbers. The EU Chemicals, Labelling and Packaging (CLP)

186

regulation (EC 1272/2008) criteria for PMT/vPvM substances [11] are displayed in Figure 1. The

187

mobility (M) aspect (see Figure 1A) is defined based on the organic-carbon-water partition

188

coefficient (KOC, with units of L/kg) of a chemical which is then log transformed to log KOC values,

189

this is used as a proxy to describe the sorption potential of a chemical to organic carbon. Since

190

experimental log KOC data are rare, it was suggested that the logarithmic octanol-water partition

191

coefficient (log KOW or log P) or the pH-adjusted log DOW (or log D) could be used as a screening

192

parameter for hydrophobicity where high-quality log KOC data are not available [24, 46]. Though

193

the two parameters have some variance, particularly for ionogenic substances, substances with

194

very low log DOW values tend to have very low log KOC values, hence log DOW values were seen

195

as a good alternative screening parameter for mobility. As such they are often used in a

196

complementary fashion (see [24, 47] for more details), where log KOW and log DOW data are used

197

when log KOC data are unavailable. Persistence (P) is defined based on the half-lives of a

198

chemical in different environmental water, sediment and soil systems (see Figure 1B), and

199

toxicity (T) is defined based on one or a combination of the following: carcinogenicity,

200

mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity, endocrine disruption and specific target organ toxicity after

201

repeated exposure as well as long-term no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) and effect

202

concentration at a given percentage of the population (ECx) shown in Figure 1C.

203

A compound is a considered a PMT substances when it fulfils the persistence, mobility and toxicity

204

criteria (i.e. a combination of at least one persistency criterion, one mobility criterion and one

205

toxicity criterion are met) or in the case of vPvM at least one of the criteria for very persistent and

206

the very mobile criterion must be met (see Figure 1). Some examples of PMT/vPvM substances

207

are shown in Figure 2.

221

There are several published lists containing PMT/vPvM substances (e.g. the PMT list by

222

Holmberg et al., UBAPMT, EAWAGPMT, UFZHSFPMT, ZEROPM and PMTPFAS) [20, 48–52].

223

The later five have been digitized and are hosted on the NORMAN Suspect List Exchange

224

(NORMAN-SLE) [53, 54] and thus openly available with a CC-BY license. The UBAPMT suspect

225

list contains substances currently registered under REACH that meet the proposed PMT/vPvM

226

criteria set by UBA in 2019 [47]. The original list has 254 substances [55, 56], while the 2022

227

revised version has 340 substances [57, 58] due to an increase in chemicals registered in REACH

228

and updated chemical information [20]. The EAWAGPMT list contains 1,156 compounds

229

identified in groundwater by Kiefer et al. [49, 59]. This list contains a mix of compounds on other

230

PMT lists as well as compounds on the Swedish Chemical Agency (KEMI) market list [60] that

231

have a low log Dow and high water exposure index, while the UFZHSFPMT list includes 1,063

232

potential persistent mobile compounds detected in surface water as described by Neuwald et al.

233

[50, 61, 62]. The ZEROPMBOX1 contains 38 compounds, including representative per- and poly-

234

fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), triazines and triazoles used to start the H2020 ZeroPM project

235

[51]. Finally, the PMTPFAS list contains 180 fluorinated compounds extracted from the UBAPMT,

236

EAWAGPMT and UFZHSFPMT lists [52]. In combination, the five lists contain 2,081 unique

237

compounds, but this does not represent all PMT/vPvM substances in the global market.

238

239

Grouping and Regulations

240

Assessing and regulating individual PMT/vPvM substances that fall within a PMT/vPvM substance

241

group is inefficient and more time-consuming than assessing an entire group. Past strategies

242

have led to drop-in replacements, subsequently referred to as regrettable substitution [25].

243

Assessing chemicals individually also ignores cumulative exposures and risks of groups of

244

substances [63]. Considering primarily the structural similarity and similar properties of PMT/vPvM

245

substances, it may be more feasible and prudent to regulate these substances as a group. The

246

idea of substance grouping based on the relationship between hazard and structural similarity is

247

not new, since many of the very first organic substances to be regulated were groups sharing a

248

similar structure. The successes of regulation in managing substances as groups such as ozone-

249

depleting substances (ODS) under the Montreal Protocol [64, 65] and specific groups of persistent

250

organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention [66] are discussed below. Moreover,

251

successfully grouping substances for regulation not only accelerates but also prevents and
9

252

reduces inconsistencies in the regulatory process [67]. Grouping substances can enhance

253

chemical safety management, facilitating the identification of regulated substances and potential

254

substitutes for harmful ones [67].

255

While there may be several legislations about grouping substances globally, this section focuses

256

on the use of grouping in EU legislation. In the EU, the European Chemical Agency (ECHA)

257

coordinates the REACH regulation for the restriction, evaluation and authorization of substances

258

based on hazard classifications and the CLP regulation for labelling based on hazard

259

classifications. REACH Annex XI section 1.5 specifies how groups or categories of substances

260

can be defined and which regulatory actions can be applied [31]. It states that “substances whose

261

physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties are likely to be similar or follow a

262

regular pattern as a result of structural similarity may be considered as a group, or ‘category’ of

263

substances” [31]. The toxicological or hazard properties referred to are described in the CLP

264

regulation shown in Figure 1.

265

According to Article 36 of the CLP regulation, certain substances, including those with respiratory

266

sensitizing properties (category 1), germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive

267

toxicity (category 1A, 1B and 2), are considered hazardous and are subject to harmonized

268

classification. This also applies to active substances listed in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and

269

Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 [68, 69]. Moreover, Article 57 of REACH includes substances that

270

are hazardous to the environment and are also subject to harmonized classification. A list of these

271

hazardous substances for which harmonized classification and labelling has been established at

272

the EU level can be found in Part 3 of Annex VI of the CLP regulation.

273

Under REACH, UVCBs are regulated based on the structural similarity of the constituents

274

identified and can also be regulated as part of a different group. This means that certain

275

components of these substances may be identified and registered as part of a different group.

276

Annex XI section 1.5 of REACH provides more information on the regulation of UVCBs [31, 70].

and bromine into the stratosphere, damaging the ozone layer [64, 72]. This can lead to increased

283

global warming, skin cancer and damage to marine ecosystems [73]. The Montreal Protocol is

284

considered to have drastically decreased relative consumption (total of production and imports -

285

total of exports and destroyed) of ODS in the EU (100% to 0.36%) and globally (100% to 1.35%)

286

between 1986 and 2021 [71, 74], as shown in Figure 3. This is an example of a property-based

287

regulatory effort that has been successful [71, 75]. However, the Montreal Protocol has also been

288

criticized for shifting the burden by transitioning from ODS to greenhouse gases and PMT/vPvM

289

precursors, as discussed further below.

such as aldrin, chlordane and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Over time, the list expanded

299

to include 39 substances and substance groups as of January 2024, with the regulation covering

300

the manufacturing, sales, use, and waste management of these chemicals, as well as

301

unintentional releases in some cases [66, 78]. Structural similarity and the resulting similar

302

compound properties played a major role in managing the grouping of substances under the

303

Convention, for instance, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins and DDT derivatives [79].

304

The Stockholm Convention has been successful in reducing the emission of regulated POPs

305

since its enforcement. The emission levels of PCBs, for example, decreased by over 60% from

306

2001 to 2020, while dioxin levels also dropped by 50% from 2001 to 2020 (top of Figure 4). This

307

reduction is also noticeable as the number of registered patents for 17 dioxins, 12 PCBs and

308

hexachlorobenzene (HCB) dropped since the Convention (bottom of Figure 4).

316

Substitution of regulated substances with PMT/vPvM

317

substances

318

The concept of regrettable substitution first appeared in the literature in 2011 [82]. There are many

319

examples of regrettable substitution, which refers to the practice of replacing a hazardous

320

substance with a structurally similar substance for a specific use or function, that is also hazardous

321

or potentially more hazardous, or that has not been tested broadly enough for different hazards

322

and other than those of the substance being replaced [83]. One well-known example is Bisphenol

323

A, an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that was first discovered in 1891 [84]. Due to its

324

harmful effects, it has since been replaced by various other EDCs with similar structures such as

325

Bisphenol S and Bisphenol P. Currently, more than 30 bisphenols, including the ones mentioned

326

above, are recommended for restriction by ECHA [85].

327

One of the reasons for the “drop-in” solution by companies after substance regulation (both as

328

individual or as a group) is that structurally similar substances often have similar functions in the

329

product being applied, and can be manufactured generally without requiring substantial changes

330

in processes, infrastructure, or product testing [63]. Unfortunately, similar toxicological effects are

331

likely to occur as well [26], and at other times “burden shifting” towards different hazards. A key

332

example is the series of restrictions related to the Montreal Protocol that began with a global

333

phase-out of CFCs [86, 87]. Later, hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs) were introduced as

334

replacements but were only briefly commercialized [88]. They were then replaced with

335

hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which exhibited substantially less ozone-depleting potential,

336

and exhibited the same commercial properties as CFCs [89]. HCFCs were eventually also

337

included under the Montreal Protocol and were again replaced by chemicals with similar

338

chemistry, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) [64]. Due to the removal of chlorine atoms from the

339

molecules, HFCs no longer pose a threat to the stratospheric ozone layer [90], but they are still

340

highly persistent and have high global warming potential. Therefore, in a subsequent amendment

341

to the Montreal Protocol, the Kigali Amendment, HFCs themselves were listed [90, 91]. As a

342

consequence of the Kigali amendment, the industry that manufactures fluorinated gases then

343

sought to substitute HFCs with hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which have a short atmospheric lifetime

344

of 6 days [92, 93]. However, these HFOs (almost) exclusively degrade to form trifluoroacetic acid

345

(TFA), a vPvM substance that is ubiquitous in the environment, especially in drinking water

346

systems, but the current understanding of its risk to human health and the environment is limited.

347

While some research has argued that TFA has low health risks [94, 95], other studies have shown

13
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tn5t5-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-8145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

348

mild liver hypertrophy in rats, and eye and skin irritation [94, 96]. As the levels of TFA are rapidly

349

increasing, some EU countries have proposed to ban HFOs as part of the broad PFAS restriction

350

under REACH. In summary, although the Montreal Protocol is often considered the most

351

successful multilateral environmental agreement, this has led to burden shifting over time from

352

ODS to the production of persistent, mobile substances such as TFA.

353

Similar to the Montreal Protocol, increased regulatory pressure on PBT/vPvB substances in

354

Europe and the USA was seen as a driver for the chemical industry to produce more hydrophilic,

355

and hence mobile, substances [97]. Individual fluoropolymer manufacturers have developed their

356

own structurally similar per- and polyfluoroalkylether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) as replacements

357

for PFOA, which was used as a processing aid in fluoropolymer production. However, as

358

mentioned above, some of these replacements, including GenX, are similarly problematic despite

359

being less bioaccumulative [98]. To date, many monitoring programs have seen an increase in

360

these replacements in water resources and fish due to increasing use and emissions [99]. GenX

361

and PFBS were identified as SVHCs under the EU REACH regulation in 2019 and were some of

362

the first SVHCs that were considered an equivalent level of concern to PBT/vPvB substances

363

[12]. Thus, the phasing out of some PBT/vPvB substances such as the long-chain PFASs has led

364

to burden shifting towards PMT/vPvM substances such as PFECAs [100].

365

Existing regulation of substances as groups based on structural similarity and/or intrinsic

366

properties has been successful, as demonstrated in the Montreal Protocol of ODSs and the

367

Stockholm Convention of POPs. Meanwhile, regrettable substitution with increasing production

368

of PMT/vPvM substances such as TFA and GenX has been noted as a side-effect. This shows a

369

limitation of the grouping approach under the Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention:

370

limiting the scope of intrinsic properties during grouping may lead to burden shifting to other

371

hazards. This calls for a grouping strategy that can prevent regrettable substitution and improve

372

the efficiency and effectiveness of chemical regulatory processes.

377

Grouping strategies

378

Grouping based on structural similarity

379

Read-across in substance grouping is a strategy that relies on the use of important information

380

obtained from tests conducted on a reference substance known as the “source” substance within

381

a group to predict the properties of another substance in the group known as the “target”

382

substance [101]. This method relies on justified similarities in structure, toxicokinetic,

383

physicochemical and molecular properties, transformation process/endpoints and other similar

384

data for interpolation and extrapolation of relevant information [102] and is recommended in

385

Section 1.5 of Annex XI of the REACH regulation for groups of substances [70]. It can be applied

386

from a single source substance to a single target substance (analogue approach) or from multiple

387

source substances to multiple target substances within a group (category approach) [101, 103].

388

This method is commonly used to fill data gaps for chemical safety assessment in the regulatory

389

process but has also been used to build grouping hypotheses for categories of chemicals [101,

390

102]. The Read-Across Assessment Framework (RAAF) by ECHA and the OECD guidance on

391

the grouping of chemicals have been developed to guide systematic and consistent applications

392

of read-across [104, 105].

393

Read-across is advantageous because it reduces the number of experimental tests needed

394

during an assessment by using existing experimental data for the source substance(s) to predict

395

the properties of the untested substance(s) [106]. If a clear hypothesis and justification are

396

provided, read-across can be used efficiently to predict the hazard properties of target substances

397

and fill data gaps in the regulatory process, thereby facilitating and speeding up assessment and

398

regulatory decisions [107]. However, read-across requires an adequate justification for use, and

399

appropriate documentation covering all assumptions and conclusions [36, 107]. This can be

400

complex and may require a certain level of expertise for interpretation [108]. Despite its limitations,

401

read-across can be applied to the grouping of PMT/vPvM substances.

402

For persistence in the environment, an important property is the readiness of the bonds to be

403

broken down under ambient conditions, whether it be from radical reactions or through metabolic

404

processes. For instance, the C-F bonds in PFAS (bond dissociation energy of 513.8 ± 10.0

405

kJ/mol), and aromatic-Cl bonds in PCBs or dioxins (394.9 ± 13.4 kJ/mol), are difficult to break

406

down in the environment, making groups rich in such bonds likely to be persistent [109].

407

Compounds with molecules containing high bond dissociation energies can be flagged for

408

persistence assessment and subsequent inclusion as PMT/vPvM if each of the M and/or T criteria

409

are met. Biodegradability models can be used to quickly provide relevant information about the

410

persistence of many substances or the presence of many persistent substructures, pending

411

further investigation and confirmation by experimental studies [110]. However, the applicability

412

domain of available models is dependent on their training data, resulting in unreliable predictions

413

for compound classes that may not be covered yet [110].

414

For mobility, the chemical substructures that are associated with low KOC values are those that

415

are highly polar or ionic, as this favours their water solubility over sorption to soil organic carbon

416

[24, 111]. A 2022 review found that most ionic compounds with measured log KOC values have

417

log KOC values <4.0 [24]. Thus, the presence of many hydrophilic substituents may be a predictor

418

of mobility, and conversely, chemicals with largely hydrophobic substructures are unlikely to be

419

mobile in the environment. However, an important limitation of mobility is size. Extremely large

420

molecules that are highly polar and ionic may not be mobile if they have sufficient hydrophobic

421

substructures to decrease their solubility, or (as in the case of water-soluble polymers) can

422

aggregate for charge neutrality and therefore lose/reduce their mobility as an aggregate [112].

423

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are available to predict the mobility of

424

certain substances and can be applied effectively (within their respective applicability domains)

425

to classify the mobility of substances.

426

The toxicity of a substance is related to its chemical structure and determines the type of health

427

effects it induces in the biological systems [113]. The interaction of a chemical with a biological

428

system is determined by the functional groups, stereochemistry and other molecular features

429

[114]. A change in the structure can lead to changes in toxicity, depending on how this change

430

affects the toxicophore – the structural portion associated with the toxicity of the chemical [115].

431

The descriptors used for toxicity predictions vary between models, some models consider only

432

2D descriptors, while others use a mix of 2D and 3D descriptors. In recent years some models

433

have also attempted to predict toxicity through graph neural networks which take the position of

434

the different functional groups into consideration [116, 117]. Toxicity is also related to the

435

absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion ability of the body, which depends on the

436

chemical structure of the substance. Increased hydrophobicity leads to increased absorption and

437

increased potential toxic effects (due to potential bioaccumulation). A concern with PMT/vPvM

438

substances is chronic exposure via water consumption, which can lead to elevated concentrations

439

in humans and diverse biota [12, 118].

440

Considering the chemical features that make these substances P, M and T, and the provided

441

criteria for classification, PMT/vPvM substances can be identified and grouped accordingly. Read-

442

across can be applied to identify PMT substances on the basis that they have similar

443

(sub)structures, similar properties and available toxicological data. This can be done through a

444

fragment-based approach, which relies on the identification of small similar fragments or

445

functional groups with similar properties [119]. Substance grouping approaches take the fragment

446

models one step further. Substances can have similar properties due to the similarity in structures

447

– this includes functional groups, common precursors or reaction products, and a constant pattern

448

in the changing of the potency of the properties across the group [31, 104]. The substance

449

grouping approach is used in read-across techniques and alternative assessments [104]. This

450

has been supported by the use of various models that predict physical-chemical property

451

information such as the KOCWIN model [120]. This is a fragment-based model that relates

452

substructures and mobility (KOC) based on appropriate training data [120].. The mobility (KOC) of

453

new chemicals can be predicted using the established relationship (when they are within the

454

applicability domain). Similarly, the ReadyBiodegradable model in OPERA [36] and CERAPP and

455

CoMPARA models [116, 121]can be used to predict the biodegradability and toxicity, respectively,

456

of many new PMT/vPvM substances.

457

Grouping based on retained moieties from transformation

458

reactions

459

Both biotic and abiotic transformations generally result in transformation products (TPs) with

460

significantly higher mobility (lower log KOW) than their parent compounds or precursors, making

461

them more mobile in the environment. This seems intuitive as one of the "goals'' of metabolism

462

and wastewater treatment processes is to increase the polarity of the compounds. For metabolic

463

processes, this allows the compounds to be expelled from the body with the urine. However, some

464

persistent substructures may be retained during the transformation resulting in similar toxic

465

properties between the parent compound and TPs. For example, decabromodiphenyl ethane

466

forms 6 metabolites that were found to be carcinogenic like the parent compound [122]. In other

467

cases, even small structural changes can result in large differences in toxicity such as for

468

bis(pentabromophenyl) ether, which has low thyroid binding affinity itself but can form the TP

469

2,3,5,6-tetrabromo-4-(2,3,4,5,6-pentabromophenoxy)phenol with a strong thyroid binding affinity

470

[122]. Therefore, it is of interest not only to identify parent compounds that may be PMT/vPvM,

17
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tn5t5-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-8145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

471

but also compounds that can form PMT/vPvM TPs, along with identifying the common persistent

472

and mobile moieties that were retained and not readily metabolized. Such an approach would be

473

consistent with the approach to substance grouping in REACH of identifying “common breakdown

474

products via physical and biological processes, which result in structurally similar chemicals”

475

(REACH Annex XI, Section 1.5).

476

One way to do this identification is by using known reactions, such as those contained within the

477

“transformations” section in PubChem, which links parent compounds to TPs with basic reaction

478

information [123]. Of all the substances on the five suspect lists mentioned above,

479

perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has the highest number of recorded parent compounds (22) in the

480

PubChem transformations section (from version 0.1.6 of the dataset archived on Zenodo) [124].

481

This is also one of several PMT/vPvM TPs where parent compounds are included in the legislation

482

as part of the substance group. Specifically, the Stockholm Convention restricts the use of PFOA-

483

related compounds, which include compounds that form PFOA after degradation [78]. TFA is also

484

a known TP of several different compounds containing a CF3– moiety. Since there are over 5

485

million compounds containing a CF3– moiety included in PubChem [125], many of which are also

486

industrially relevant, there are myriad potential sources of TFA.

487

Triazoles are another example of moieties preserved from parent compounds to TPs. Out of the

488

triazole compounds in PubChem, 62 have recorded TPs (12 Jan 2024) [124]. This corresponds

489

to 233 unique reactions, out of which the triazole moiety is retained in 88% of the cases, showing

490

its high stability. While usually not acutely toxic in low doses, triazoles may cause several severe

491

chronic toxic effects such as endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity [126]. Triazole substances

492

such as benzotriazoles are present in the environment at high levels [126]. Thus, the retention of

493

this functional group and other PMT/vPvM moieties may be concerning from an exposure point

494

of view, supporting the idea that grouping based on retained moieties or TPs is relevant to obtain

495

comprehensive and inclusive groups for PMT/vPvM substances.

496

Another example of how substances can be regulated based on their precursors are the aromatic

497

amines registered under REACH some of which can also be found on PMT/vPvM suspect lists,

498

such as 4,4'-methylenedianiline, 4,4'-oxydianiline, 4-chloroaniline, 3,3’-dichlorobenzidine, 4,4'-

499

methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), 4,4'-methylenedianiline, and 2-methoxy-5-methylaniline [20, 31,

500

50]. However, there are several other aromatic amines that have multiple known precursors listed

501

in the PubChem transformations library (e.g. 4-aminophenol and aniline) that are also listed as

18

502

PMT by the UBAPMT suspect list. As such, regulating aromatic amines and precursor substances

503

as a group based on PMT/vPvM substances warrants further investigation and consideration.

504

505

Cheminformatics

506

PMT/vPvM substances

507

The strategies mentioned above regarding grouping can be matched to substance regulation in

508

various ways. Firstly, substances falling within a PMT/vPvM group with little known data could be

509

flagged for follow-up to see if persistence and mobility measurements have been conducted in

510

literature, and if read-across methods (based on patterns with other substances) could be used

511

to fill data gaps. This could help prioritise filling data gaps and would help develop read-across

512

approaches for further substances within the group. Secondly, if any other substance with a

513

similar structure exists in the group and is hazardous (source substance), this could be seen as

514

a reason to investigate for similar toxicological hazards for this substance (target substance). If

515

several members within a group are shown to be PMT/vPvM substances, then a precautionary

516

approach would be to assume all group members with no assessments are similarly hazardous,

517

until there is sufficient scientific data to show otherwise. An overview of an assessment procedure

518

to identify PMT/vPvM substances has also been presented by Neumann and Schliebner (2019),

519

suggesting to first assess compounds for persistence followed by mobility and toxicity for both

520

precursors and transformation products [47].

521

Estimating the number of individuals and groups of chemicals that fit the PMT/vPvM classification

522

is a challenging task. Most substances lack readily available persistence, mobility and toxicity

523

data. Due to the limited data availability, the prediction models of these properties are also limited

524

in their accuracy and applicability domains. However, some data and models are available as a

525

starting point, especially for log KOW. For example, both XlogP and the newer XlogP3 [127, 128]

526

and the KOWWIN [129] module in EPI Suite [130] use a multivariate regression approach to KOW

527

prediction. While KOC data is more limited than KOW data, there are also several models which

528

attempt to predict KOC, including KOCWIN from EPI Suite [37] and the KOC module of OPERA

529

[36], which both utilise the training data from the PHYSPROP database [36, 37]. For persistence,

(BiodegHL,

531

ReadyBiodegradable and Km) as well as one module predicting rate constants for gas-phase

532

reactions with hydroxyl-radicals, though with more limited applicability domains compared to the

533

KOC module [36]. The prediction of toxicity is even more challenging due to the limited availability

534

of training data. However, models already exist for several toxicological endpoint predictions such

535

as endocrine disruption, mutagenicity and developmental toxicity for many possible structures

536

[131, 132]. For example, the CERAPP and CoMPARA models in OPERA can be used to predict

537

estrogen and androgen receptor interactions [116, 121].

538

An example of how a combination of experimental and predicted property data has been used to

539

classify compounds as PMT/vPvM is the study by Arp and Hale (2022), which focused on the

540

compounds in the REACH inventory [24]. Their study concluded that about 1.9% of substances

541

registered in REACH and 24% of REACH-registered substances that were detected in drinking

542

water sources would be classified as PMT. However, over 40% of the inventory could not be

543

assessed due to data gaps. This illustrates the importance of acquiring experimental data for a

544

wider range of compounds.

545

To further illustrate how predicted properties can be used for assessing PMT compounds, the

546

PubChemLite for Exposomics [133] dataset was used to give a preliminary estimate of the number

547

of potential environmental contaminants that are predicted to meet the CLP definition of mobility.

548

PubChemLite is a subset of ~350,000 compounds from PubChem with environmentally relevant

549

annotation content [133]. In total, KOC values were predicted for 346,133 compounds (96.0% of

550

PubChemLite) using the molecular connectivity index (MCI) model from KOCWIN [37, 120]. The

551

results of the log KOC distribution are shown in Figure 5. Based on these predicted values log KOC,

552

147,930 compounds (41%) would be considered mobile and 78,107 compounds (21%) would be

553

considered very mobile. The MCI model assigns values of 1 and 0 for chemicals when KOC

554

predictions have been overcorrected. The large peak at log KOC 10 is an upper bound for these

555

predictions within the MCI model output. Note that the results of this analysis will differ if the KOW-

556

based model in KOWWIN is used.

number of compounds inside each bin. Bin widths are 0.2.

561
562

To investigate this concept in more detail on slightly smaller subsets, four compound classes:

563

triazines, aromatic amines, PFAS and triazoles were selected based on the five suspect lists

564

mentioned previously (UBAPMT, EAWAGPMT, UFZHSFPMT, PMTPFAS and ZEROPMBOX1)

565

[20, 49–52]. The substructure search function of PubChem was then used to estimate the number

566

of compounds that belong to these compound classes. An overview of these search queries can

567

be found in Table 1. As can be seen in the first three rows, relatively unspecific substructures can

568

generate very large query results. For the 1,2,3-triazole substructure over 1 million substances

569

were found, which corresponded to a search of only 87% of the database as the search results

570

are capped at 1 million substances. Similarly, the aromatic amines (with aniline as the searched

571

substructure) resulted in over 1 million substances with only 2% of the database searched. The

572

1,3,5-triazine query resulted in 718,119 substances. The compounds classified within the OECD

573

definition of PFAS in the PubChem PFAS tree were used to source PFAS, which contained

574

6,604,017 compounds at the time the queries were performed (Dec. 17, 2023) [125]. It is unlikely

575

that all compounds containing these substructures would meet the PMT/vPvM criteria outlined in

576

the CLP. For example, only 250,873 of the 718,199 triazines meet the CLP criteria for mobility

577

based on the predicted log KOW from XlogP3. As such the substructures used when discussing

578

PMT/vPvM compound grouping for regulation purposes should be more specific.

579

More specific substructure queries were used to interrogate these results further according to the

580

PMT/vPvM criteria, shown in the remaining rows of Table 1 and Figure 6, using the structures of

581

melamine, benzotriazole and benzidine as well as the “larger PFAS parts” definition (contains –

582

CF2CF2–) from the PubChem PFAS tree [125]. The search was then progressively restricted to

583

exclude the searched substructures from being part of larger ring systems and substances with

584

molecular weights greater than 300 g/mol. The results of this search were also used to perform

585

persistence and toxicity prediction as discussed above. The top two rows of Figure 6 show these

586

substructure query results. Like their less specific triazine counterpart, they seem too broad to

587

capture only PMT/vPvM substances. However, when restricting the search to only compounds

588

below 300 g/mol, between 87 and 99% of the compounds would meet the CLP definition of

589

mobility. The most restricted PubChem search results were also used for biodegradability and

590

LC50 predictions using the ReadyBiodegradable model from OPERA and MS2Tox (compounds

591

which fell outside the applicability domain of the ReadyBiodegradable model were excluded in

592

the biodegradability results; this information is not given by MS2Tox). As can be seen in Figure

593

6, almost all compounds inside the applicability domain were classified as non-biodegradable.

594

This indicates that in addition to their mobility, most compounds within these classes are

595

potentially persistent. Based on the EU CLP definition of toxicity, an EC10 less than 0.01 mg/L is

596

toxic for marine or freshwater organisms. Some of the predicted LC50 toxicity values (the lethal

597

concentration at 50% of the population) shown in Figure 6 go below 0.1 mg/L. As toxicity is usually

598

observed before lethality, this indicates that some of the compounds may be toxic below 0.01

599

mg/L. In addition, it is important to note that this is not the only toxicity criterion used in the CLP,

600

for example, triazole compounds have been shown to have endocrine-disrupting properties by

601

e.g., Wang et al. (2022) [134] and thus it is likely that at least a fraction of these compounds would

602

be classified as PMT.

Perspectives for grouping strategies

620

Challenges for assessing and managing PMT/vPvM

621

substances

622

Based on the criteria for persistence, mobility and toxicity, many chemicals (as shown from the

623

prediction results above) may be PMT/vPvM substances, warranting further assessments and

624

management (see Table 1). One of the major challenges of dealing with PMT/vPvM substances

625

is the lack of high-quality data. As shown above, there is a growing need for computational

626

modelling to complement experimental approaches as the number of substances to be tested

627

increases, yet efficient computational methods rely on high quality and sufficient experimental

628

data availability, which is a major limiting factor. Structurally diverse substances with multiple

629

functional groups and stereochemistry can lead to unexpected behaviour, posing a critical

630

challenge [135]. However, developing high-throughput screening (HTS) methods for toxicity

631

testing may be difficult for these diverse substances and toxicological endpoints, which produce

632

large amounts of data, and require expert knowledge to interpret and manage [136].

633

Identification, monitoring and removal are other challenges to managing PMT/vPvM substances.

634

Targeted identification and monitoring approaches will not be sufficient to detect all PMT/vPvM

635

substances, hence it is crucial to ensure wider availability of analytical methods and reference

636

standards to properly identify, quantify and assess potential PMT/vPvM substances. Targeted

637

analysis could be complemented with non-targeted analytical approaches. Non-target analysis

638

can be a first step in identifying unknown and emerging PMT/vPvM substances and their TPs in

639

environmental and biological matrices. It can also be used for the monitoring of known PMT/vPvM

640

substances, yet regulatory acceptance of non-targeted monitoring is still lacking [137]. Moreover,

641

the lack of data on persistence, mobility, toxicity, TPs, complex mixtures and appropriate suspect

642

lists for broader suspect screening poses identification and monitoring challenges [22].

643

Prioritization strategies for testing and assessment

644

Considering many potential PMT/vPvM substances, and the possible challenges outlined, it is

645

necessary to develop other strategies that could be used in combination with the proposed

25
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tn5t5-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-8145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

646

grouping strategies above to prioritize chemicals for assessing their PMT/vPvM properties.

647

Exposure and emission information could serve in the prioritization of chemicals for testing.

648

Utilising exposure information such as mode of exposure (chemicals in food or drinking water)

649

[138, 139] or Occupational Exposure Banding strategy for categorization of airborne substances

650

lacking defined limits [140], could help identify chemicals with high exposure potential.

651

Additionally, the hazard level of the toxicity can be used as a criterion, where specific persistent

652

and mobile substances with high toxicity can be targeted for prioritization.

653

The use of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches can aid the grouping and prioritization of

654

chemicals for testing or assessments by regulatory bodies. This can be done by generating

655

grouping hypotheses and justification for inclusion or exclusion criteria for substances in groups

656

[140]. In particular, novel approaches may generate huge amounts of toxicological and high-

657

throughput “omics” data including metabolomics, transcriptomics, and exposomics to support the

658

validation and establishment of grouping hypotheses needed by regulatory authorities [141]. An

659

example of a grouping hypothesis is the mode of action (MOA) hypothesis, which states that all

660

chemicals that share a common mode of action are candidates for grouping [142]. Additionally,

661

concepts such as adverse outcome pathways and toxicity pathways can be translated into

662

prioritization hypotheses that can target specific substances, hence advancing prioritization for

663

hazard assessment [143, 144]. These can facilitate regulator efforts to restrict hazardous

664

substances.

665

Measurable biological and physiological effects of chemical exposure, known as effect

666

biomarkers, can be used to group PMT/vPvM substances according to their toxicological profiles.

667

If two substances induce similar biomarker responses indicative of for instance genotoxicity, or

668

endocrine disruption, they can be grouped. This approach can also help to identify common

669

pathways of toxicity, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), or mechanisms of toxicity. By grouping

670

substances with similar toxic profiles as PMT/vPvM substances, effect biomarkers can aid in

671

characterizing cumulative risks posed by mixtures and complex chemical substances. This

672

proactive approach focuses on biological effects rather than relying solely on the structural and

673

chemical properties of PMT/vPvM substances [145, 146]

674

It is crucial to recognize that the effectiveness of strategies used for prioritizing substances largely

675

depends on the availability of relevant data, including hazard and exposure data. To improve the

676

availability and quality of such data, it is necessary to foster collective efforts such as high-quality

677

data generation, community-level data collection, Open Science, FAIR data, and enhanced data

26
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tn5t5-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-8145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

678

sharing policies. When potential vPvM substances are identified by read-across and experimental

679

evidence as substances that meet the PMT/vPvM criteria, then a hazard classification would be

680

required. The data collected through these efforts can then be used to enhance the prioritization,

681

identification, and regulation of PMT/vPvM substances. To manage PMT/vPvM substances

682

effectively, manufacturers can be encouraged to submit a plan to remove these substances from

683

wastewater. This approach can help improve the overall management of PMT/vPvM substances.

684

As a precaution, the principle of "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) can be applied to

685

minimize exposure levels and reduce the risk of harm to PMT/vPvM substances [147].

686

687

Conclusion

688

To achieve the EU’s zero pollution ambition of a non-toxic environment by 2050, regulating the

689

production, use and disposal of PMT/vPvM substances is necessary. As shown in Table 1, scaling

690

PMT/vPvM criteria to big substance collections reveals that there are potentially thousands of

691

PMT/vPvM substances that could cause harm to human health and the environment, especially

692

concerning water quality and drinking water treatment.

693

The Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention have demonstrated that grouping

694

substances can be an effective strategy to expedite the elimination of the production, use, and

695

emission of toxic substances such as ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and persistent organic

696

pollutants (POPs). This approach can also accelerate the identification and regulatory processes

697

for substances that lack hazard information. Grouping can prevent the introduction of new

698

hazardous substances into the global market. However, it is important to ensure that grouping is

699

done in a way that is feasible and promotes the use of safer and more sustainable alternatives.

700

Otherwise, it could result in the production of regrettable substitutes, as was the case with ODSs

701

and POPs, which led to the creation of some PMT/vPvM substances.

702

Read-across based on structural or substructural similarity is one of the strategies that could be

703

used to group PMT/vPvM substances, which relies on the idea that substances with similar

704

structures have similar properties. Commonly retained moieties from transformation reactions

705

could also be a grouping strategy for PMT/vPvM substances. Substances that are structurally

27

706

similar to PMT/vPvM according to read-across, or form persistent, mobile TPs could be flagged

707

for subsequent assessment and/or regulatory actions.

708

Cheminformatics may be used for substance grouping based on predictive models for properties

709

such as biodegradability, mobility, and toxicity. PubChemLite predictions suggest that 41% of

710

potentially environmentally relevant compounds would be considered mobile (147,930

711

compounds) and 21% would be considered very mobile (78,107 compounds). Certain compound

712

classes, such as triazines, aromatic amines, triazoles and PFAS, are likely to be persistent, non-

713

biodegradable, and toxic. As shown in Table 1, the numbers are high and restricting these

714

compounds as a group would be challenging; however, prioritizing members of these large groups

715

for property testing is warranted as they contain a substructure associated with a PMT/vPvM

716

substance group. Additional strategies are needed to prioritize some substances for regulation,

717

such as mapping the uses of these chemicals and exposure which requires more data availability

718

following FAIR principles.

719

Some strategies proposed for the prioritization of substances for testing or assessment of

720

PMT/vPvM include (i) better understanding and the use of exposure/ emissions information such

721

as Occupational Exposure Banding and environmental exposure to the PMT/vPvM substances,

722

(ii) the use of in vitro, in vivo and in silico techniques to generate relevant toxicological data that

723

will support prioritization, identification and regulation of PMT/vPvM substances. These strategies

724

in combination with substance grouping could result in substituting PMT/vPvM substances with

725

safer alternatives.
