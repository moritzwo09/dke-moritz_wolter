3 Abstract:
4 There is growing concern about rubber-derived compounds (RDCs), predominantly originating from tire
5 and road wear particles. Other consumer products, including sports equipment, also contain RDCs and
6 human exposure to these compounds is of particular interest due to demonstrated toxicity to animal species.
7 In this study, we investigated RDCs intentionally incorporated into climbing shoes for enhanced
8 performance. We found high concentrations of 15 rubber derived-compounds (RDCs) in shoe sole samples
9 (Σ15 RDCs: 25 – 3405 µg/g), aerosol particulate matter (Σ15 RDCs: 2.6 - 37 µg/g), and settled dust (Σ15 RDCs:
10 1.5 - 55 µg/g) in indoor climbing halls. The estimated daily intake via inhalation/ingestion of Σ15 RDCs for
11 climbers and employees in some of these facilities ranged from 1.7 to 48 ng/kg/day, exceeding known intake
12 levels of RDCs from other sources. Abrasion powder resulting from friction between climbing shoes and
13 footholds is the likeliest source of high concentrations of RDCs observed in aerosol particulate matter and
14 settled dust. These findings reveal a previously unknown human exposure route of RDCs.

17 Synopsis: This work demonstrates how rubber abrasion from climbing shoes leads to the release of
18 potentially toxic additives in indoor air

20 Introduction:
21 Indoor air quality is a critical and increasing determinant of human health and is relevant not only in the
22 home and workplace, but also in places of recreation, such as sports facilities 1. Indoor climbing is one
23 increasingly popular form of indoor recreation. In indoor climbing halls, “handholds” and “footholds” are
24 attached to specialized walls, allowing individuals to attempt to ascend the walls (Figure 1). In 2018, an
25 estimated 1.5% of the UK population2, and about 4.4% of the US population3 visited indoor climbing halls.
26 Of these visitors, about 20% are regulars and spend several hours a day, multiple times a week in climbing
27 halls2.
28 Several monitoring studies conducted in indoor climbing gyms reported very high particulate matter
29 concentrations4,5. Particulate matter exposure during indoor climbing is hypothesized to be the driver for
30 acute decline in lung function of climbers5. Chalk used by climbers is the primary source of particulate

31 matter, but other sources may also contribute. In indoor halls, climbers wear specialized climbing shoes,
32 with soles made of highly functionalized rubber. The rubber is chemically engineered to be flexible and
33 sticky. Soles are intentionally designed to slowly abrade during climbing, due to desired friction with
34 climbing holds. This leads to a constant generation of rubber particles, which accumulate on the climbing
35 footholds. Most climbers own brushes to clean these climbing holds, which results in a constant
36 aerosolization of rubber particles, which may remain airborne long enough to be inhaled by climbers or
37 employees. The relative contribution of aerosolized rubber particles to total particulate matter remains
38 uncertain but is likely minimal in comparison to chalk, which constitutes the primary source of airborne
39 particles in indoor climbing facilities4. Concerns regarding the potential health impacts of rubber particles
40 may be more significant, as rubber typically contains a variety of chemical additives not present in chalk.
41 This difference in chemical composition warrants further investigation into the specific risks posed by rubber
42 particles in indoor climbing environments.
43 In tires, which are also highly engineered and abrade during their intended use, rubber-derived compounds
44 (RDCs) concentrations are very high6. Zhao et al. screened a wide range of elastomeric consumer products
45 for multiple organic RDCs7 and several were found ubiquitously, although the concentrations in most
46 consumer products were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than in tires. The additive profile of elastomeric
47 products was proposed to depend on the properties required for their intended use of the product 21. Due to
48 the highly specialized properties of climbing shoes, we hypothesized that climbing shoes, and resulting
49 abrasion particles, contain high additive concentrations. Indoor climbing halls may then be a hot spot of
50 human exposure due to inhalation of airborne rubber particles. This is of concern, since RDCs such as 6PPD51 quinone are also toxic to human lung cells8–10 with inhalation hypothesized to be a major route of exposure.
52 We collected aerosol particulate matter, settled dust and foothold powder samples in several climbing halls
53 across Europe and measured the concentrations of RDCs therein. Based on measured aerosol particulate
54 matter concentrations, we calculated the yearly exposure for employees and recreational visitors to these
55 rubber-derived compounds. Our data indicate that climbing shoes are the source of these rubber-derived
56 compounds.

Figure 1. Schematic of a climbing hall, with photos of the four types of samples analyzed in our study.
Specialized climbing shoes are worn with highly functionalized rubber soles (1 – shoe soles). Friction between these
shoe soles and the footholds generates rubber particles (2 – foothold powder). Those can be aerosolized and be
inhaled directly upon generation, due to the brushing of holds, or by climbers falling onto mats and resuspending
rubber particles which had settled (3 – aerosol particulate matter). Eventually, aerosol particles also settle elsewhere
as dust (4 – settled dust).
58 Materials and methods
59 Sample collection and characterization
60 Four types of samples were collected: aerosol particulate matter (aerosol PM), settled dust, shoe soles, and
61 foothold powder (rubber powder accumulated on climbing footholds which results from the abrasion of
62 climbing shoes). Complete sample sets (aerosol PM, triplicate settled dust, and triplicate foothold powder
63 samples) were collected in five halls in Vienna. These five halls vary in size, age, number of visitors, and
64 ventilation (Table S1). To assess the levels of RDCs more broadly, additional samples (triplicate settled dust
65 and triplicate foothold powder samples) were collected in four more halls, in Switzerland, France, and Spain.
66 In addition, thirty shoe sole samples representing major brands and models were analyzed. All samples were
67 collected between February 2023 and June 2024.

69 Aerosol PM was collected with a standardized glass liquid impinger (Copley Scientific Ltd) which is an
70 active sampling device that separates aerosol PM into aerosols which predominantly deposit in the upper
71 respiratory tract (> 6.4 µm aerodynamic diameter; URT) and the fraction that deposits predominantly in the
72 lower respiratory tract (< 6.4 µm aerodynamic diameter; LRT). Liquid impingers have been shown to have
73 a collection efficiency of up to 99% for particles in the 0.02 - 4 µm size range11, and are explicitly mentioned
74 by the World Health Organization as an acceptable device for sampling nano- and microplastics12. However,
75 collection efficiency of rubber particles was not validated within the scope of this study. Pooled aerosol PM
76 samples (i.e., material collected from 3 hour sampling runs) were collected in Hall 01 and Hall 02 on five
77 consecutive days in April 2023 during peak activity (5 to 8 p.m.). Pooled aerosol PM samples were collected
78 in Hall 03, 04, and 05 on five consecutive days in April and May 2024 during peak activity (5 to 8 p.m.).
79 The air inlet was set at a height of 142 cm, facing the climbing wall at approximately 3 m distance. The air
80 flow rate was 60 ± 2 L/min, for a total volume of 54 m³ air per sample in each climbing hall. Further details
81 about aerosol PM sampling are provided in Supplementary Text S1.
82
83 Settled dust samples were collected from uncleaned floor and wood surfaces 5 to 10 m from the climbing
84 walls. In each hall, settled dust from three distinct locations was sampled to assess spatial variability within
85 the hall. Dust was collected using a clean metallic spatula and immediately placed in cleaned glass vials,
86 then stored at -20°C until further processing.
87
88 Thirty shoe sole samples were collected from both used and new climbing shoes (specialized rubber shoes
89 worn while climbing, Figure 1) to represent the marketplace. Approximately 1 g of rubber was cut out from
90 the tip of the sole using a ceramic knife. Samples were cut into 1 mm2 pieces and ground into fine powder
91 using cryo-ball milling (MM400, Retsch®) for 2 min at 25 Hz. After grinding, 50 mg powder was
92 immediately suspended in 1 mL dichloromethane to prevent re-agglomeration, and then extracted. Clean
93 climbing hold and mat samples were obtained from Hall 02 and extracted via the same procedure as the shoe
94 sole samples.

95 A cleaned metal spatula was used to collect 1 – 5 g of rubber powder accumulated in the clefts of climbing
96 footholds (foothold powder samples). These foothold powder samples were immediately placed in cleaned
97 glass vials and stored at -20°C until further processing.
98 Sub-samples of pure solid chalk, foothold powder samples and settled dust samples were coated with a gold
99 nanolayer (10 nm) and visually characterized with a scanning electron microscope (Gemini SEM 300, Zeiss)
100 at various magnification levels.
101
102 Sample extraction and measurement
103 Liquid was removed from the aerosol PM samples via rotary evaporation (ethanol) and lyophilization
104 (MilliQ-water). The residual particle mass was determined gravimetrically using a high precision balance
105 and samples were resuspended in ethanol. All samples were extracted with accelerated solvent extraction
106 (Supplementary Text S2). The selection of RDCs for analysis was based on several criteria such as common
107 use in the rubber industry, diversity in terms of chemical classes, availability of commercial standards for
108 quantitation and potential toxicity for humans. Therefore, the following RDCs were analysed in all samples
109 with UPLC-MS/MS: benzothiazole (BTZ), 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (2OH-BTZ), 2-aminobenzothiazole (2110 amino-BTZ),

2-mercaptobenzothiazole

(2SH-BTZ),

aniline,

1,3-diphenylguanidine

(DPG),

111 hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine (HMMM), and the phenylenediamine compounds: 6PPD, IPPD, CPPD,
112 DPPD and their associated quinones: 6PPDq, IPPDq, CPPDq, DPPDq. Details are provided in the SI
113 regarding the chemicals and internal standards used (Supplementary Text S3), UPLC-MS/MS instruments
114 and methods (Supplementary Text S4).
115 QA/QC
116 Blanks were collected at different stages of the sample processing workflow, to assess contamination that
117 may have arisen during aerosol PM sampling (collection blanks), sample storage (storage blanks), and
118 laboratory processing (laboratory blanks). QA/QC including extraction recovery, blank collection and
119 processing are detailed in Supplementary Text S5 and Table S2.

121 To investigate background levels of RDCs, reference samples were collected in an administrative office of
122 climbing Hall 02, which was in the same building, but not connected to the climbing area. Sampling
123 procedure was the same as for the air sampling in the climbing areas. Finally, to account for other potential
124 sources of RDCs in climbing areas, samples of climbing holds (grips used for feet and hands during climbing,
125 typically made out of polyurethane or polyester), as well as two types of climbing mats from climbing Hall
126 02 were obtained and extracted (Supplementary Text S5).
127
128 Exposure calculations
129 To determine the human exposure to RDCs in climbing halls, estimated daily intake values via inhalation
130 (and ingestion) were calculated using equation (2) for two types of individuals: regular adult climbers and
131 employees working at the halls:
132
133 𝐸𝐷𝐼𝑖𝑛ℎ/𝑖𝑛𝑔 =

𝐶𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝐼𝑅 𝐸𝑇 𝐸𝐹
𝐵𝑊 𝐶𝑓

(2)

134
135 whereby 𝐸𝐷𝐼𝑖𝑛ℎ/𝑖𝑛𝑔 is the estimated daily intake via inhalation (and ingestion) (ng/kg/day), 𝐶𝑎𝑖𝑟 the
136 concentration of RDCs in the total aerosol PM (ng/m3), 𝐼𝑅 the inhalation rate (m3/hour), 𝐸𝑇 the exposure
137 time (hours/day), 𝐸𝐹 the exposure frequency (days/year), 𝐵𝑊 the body weight (kg) and 𝐶𝑓 the number of
138 days per year. Exposure parameters are available in Table S3, and were obtained from the US EPA exposure
139 factor handbook13. This calculation assumed that the RDCs in the LRT fraction represent inhalation
140 exposure, while the concentrations measured in the URT fraction represent a combination of
141 inhalation/ingestion exposure, since a high fraction of aerosol PM depositing in the extrathoracic/tracheal
142 region of the URT is quickly cleared to the gastrointestinal tract14.
143 .
144 Transformation experiments
145 Ozonation experiments were performed to investigate potential transformations of RDCs in foothold
146 powder. Foothold powder was collected from climbing Hall 01 immediately before experiment start and
147 divided into six sub-samples. An ozone chamber15 was employed to expose three sub-samples to elevated

148 ozone concentrations (1 g/m3) at room temperature for 4 hours in the dark. Ozone concentrations were
149 substantially higher than realistic indoor concentrations, which is typical for ozonation experiments16,17. NOX
150 concentration was also measured to be 9 ppm during the experiment. After ozonation, all sub samples were
151 spiked with internal standards, and extracted and measured with UPLC-MS/MS as described above.
152
153 Results and Discussion:
154
155 Air and dust concentrations of rubber-derived compounds and associated human exposure in
156 climbing halls
157 Air measurements carried out during peak activity hours revealed very high aerosol PM concentrations
158 (Table 1). The concentrations of aerosol PM (from four climbing halls) ranged from 590 µg/m3 to 1,990
159 µg/m3 in the URT fraction (>6.4 µm) and from 890 µg/m3 to 1080 µg/m3 in the LRT fraction (<6.4 µm)
160 (Table 1). Halls 01 and 03 had the highest aerosol PM concentrations, which is likely related to more
161 climbing activity (more check-ins per hour) than Halls 02, 04, and 05. Hall 05 had by far the lowest measured
162 aerosol PM concentrations, and the lowest number of check-ins per hour. The absence of ventilation in Hall
163 02 may explain its higher aerosol PM concentrations compared to Hall 04, despite similar sizes and check164 ins per hour (Table S1) A relationship between activity and aerosol PM concentrations has been previously
165 observed in climbing halls4 and gymnasiums18. The aerosol concentrations reported in this study are in the
166 same range as aerosol PM concentrations previously reported for indoor climbing halls (from 509 to 4,028
167 µg/m3, measured using an impactor with an aerodynamic size cut-off of 10 µm; PM10) 4. These values exceed
168 those of most other indoor environments19 including indoor artificial turf halls (31 to 40 µg/m3)20 and other
169 sports environments1. They are comparable to maximum reported PM10 concentrations in gymnastic
170 facilities where chalk is also used (500 to 900 µg/m3)21.

172 Aerosol PM concentrations in this study are near current limits for occupational exposure to low-toxicity
173 dusts (<4-10 mg/m3 inhalable fraction; <1.5 - 4 mg/m3 respirable fraction over an 8-hour time-weighted
174 average exposure; limits are different for different countries)22.
175 It is important to note that the presence of leachable RDCs in climbing hall dusts may pose a higher health
176 risk than conventional low-toxicity dusts, thereby providing a compelling rationale for further
177 investigations. Ten RDCs were detected above the limit of quantification in aerosol PM samples from Halls
178 01-04 (Table S4). Due to low particulate matter collected, RDC concentrations in aerosol PM from Hall 05
179 are not reported. A consistent set of RDCs dominated the chemical profile in all aerosol PM samples. Among
180 these, four RDCs were identified as transformation products (TPs) of compounds commonly used in rubber
181 products: 2OH-BTZ, BTZ, as well 6PPD-quinone were detected in the aerosol PM of all climbing halls, and
182 aniline was detected in the aerosol PM of Halls 01 and 02. All transformation products were quantified using
183 authentic standards. Cumulative RDC concentrations in the URT fraction ranged from 0.92 to 28.4 ng/m3,
184 while RDC concentrations in the LRT fraction ranged from 1.10 to 7.81 ng/m3. Higher RDC concentrations
185 were found in the URT fraction of aerosol PM, although in Hall 03, total RDC concentrations, as well as
186 individual concentrations of 2OH-BTZ, BTZ, HMMM, and 6PPD were notably higher in the LRT fraction
187 than the URT fraction (Table S4). It is important to mention that these mass-based concentrations are
188 normalized to total APM mass, so the higher RDC concentrations in the LRT fraction in hall 03 could be
189 due to a reduction in other sources of fine particulate matter in that hall rather than different characteristics
190 of respirable rubber particles. In fact, RDC profile was quite similar between the URT and LRT fractions of
191 all halls except in Hall 04 where benzothiazole was not detected in the LRT fraction (Figure S2).
192
193 It has been shown that concentrations in settled dust of organic compounds with similar physico194 characteristics as RDCs (phthalate esters) tend to correlate with their concentrations in aerosol PM23, thus,
195 we quantified RDCs in dust samples from all climbing halls. We detected 14 out of the 15 RDCs (except
196 CPPD-Q) in at least one triplicate sample from nine climbing halls investigated (Table 2). Since settled dust
197 samples collected from different areas of a hall contain different amounts of rubber particles, substantial
198 variability in total RDC concentrations was observed between triplicate settled dust samples (Table S4).
199 However, the chemical profiles within dust samples from nine halls were consistent except in Hall 02 and

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-r6t15-v5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7312-9145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

200 were consistently dominated by the same chemicals, which dominated the profile of aerosol PM samples
201 (Figure 3). Overall, cumulative RDC concentrations in settled dust samples were high (1.6 to 55 µg/g). The
202 similarity in chemical profile of settled dust and aerosol PM samples from nine halls in four different
203 countries (France, Switzerland, Spain and Austria) suggests an important source of RDCs which may be
204 ubiquitously present in climbing halls. One exception to this similarity was the elevated concentrations of
205 HMMM present in all sample types (particularly in settled dust) from Hall 02, suggesting an alternate source
206 of HMMM in this hall. Hall 02 was built inside an old building, within the historical city center of Vienna,
207 while all other climbing halls are constructed in newer buildings. Aside from its use in rubber, HMMM is
208 used in production of plastics and metal coatings24, and it is possible that building materials may contribute
209 to the elevated concentrations of HMMM in Hall 02. It is worth noting here that reference samples of APM
210 from offices in Hall 02 did not contain detectable HMMM concentrations.

212
213 Concentrations of most RDCs in settled dust samples were higher in some halls than those reported from
214 other indoor environments (Figure 2, Figure S1). In some samples (particularly in Halls 06 and 09), BTZ
215 concentrations were one or two orders of magnitudes higher in our samples than in house dust and even road
216 dust 25–27. 6PPDq concentrations were also higher than in most house dust samples collected around the
217 world28–31 and were similar to road dust samples32,33. Concentrations of DPG were also high (up to 9.65 µg/g)
218 and exceeded most reported DPG concentrations in house dust34,35 (Figure 2).

Figure 3. Rubber-derived compound profile shift. Rubber-derived compound profile in foothold powder, settled
dust, and aerosol PM. Foothold powder and settled dust compound profiles for each hall represent an average of
triplicate samples, aerosol PM represents an average of the URT and LRT fractions. Individual, absolute
concentrations for each sample are presented in Table S4. Aerosol PM was only collected from halls 01-05, and in
Hall 05, the collected mass of aerosol PM was too low for accurate analysis of RDCs.

220
221 Similar to dust, the concentrations of most RDCs in the collected aerosol PM samples were very high,
222 particularly in Halls 01, 02, and 03 compared to other atmospheric environments (Figure 2, Figure S1 and
223 SI: Excel file containing concentrations of all RDCs). PPD and PPDq concentrations in the LRT fraction of
224 this study were higher than those measured in the PM2.5 fraction of aerosols collected in Chinese
225 megacities36,37 and similar to concentrations determined from PM2.5 fractions at roadside sites and city centres
226 in China during air pollution events38. Concentrations of DPG, BTZ, and 2OH-BTZ in aerosol PM samples

227 collected in the LRT fraction were one or two orders of magnitude higher than those determined in the total
228 particulate matter collected in 18 megacities worldwide39 and BTZ and 2OH-BTZ were up to 10-fold above
229 concentrations measured in PM10 fraction of aerosols from industrial areas in Spain40. So far, studies
230 reporting RDC concentrations in aerosol PM collected in indoor environments remain very scarce. Dye et
231 al. (2006)20 reported higher concentrations of 2amino-BTZ, 2SH-BTZ and IPPD but lower concentrations
232 of 2OH-BTZ in PM10 collected in indoor artificial turf halls compared to our aerosol PM data. However,
233 these data should be treated with caution, as they are not based on direct measurements but on RDC
234 concentrations in ground granulate and estimated rubber concentrations in aerosol PM. This approach does
235 not account for potential differences in chemical composition between airborne rubber particles and those
236 on the ground, such as those resulting from atmospheric transformations. Additionally, the distinct rubber237 derived chemical composition of turf granulate (often made from recycled tires) compared to climbing shoes
238 may explain the discrepancies between the concentrations reported by Dye et al. and our measured
239 concentrations41.

241 We calculated the estimated daily intake via inhalation and ingestion (EDIinh/ing) for adult climbers and
242 employees working at the halls (Table 3; Table S3 for details). Mean EDIinh/ing values showed that employees

243 would be subjected to a higher exposure than climbers due to their longer average exposure time, despite
244 their lower inhalation rate (Tables 3, S3). EDIinh/ing for ∑benzothiazoles ranged from 0.04 to 29 ng/kg/day
245 and exceeded EDIinh/ing for ∑PPDs (up to 0.9 ng/kg/day) which were similar to EDIinh/ing for ∑PPDqs (up to
246 1.5 ng/kg/day). Even though EDIs are presented as daily exposures, they account for exposure frequency
247 throughout the year (see equation 2) making them directly comparable with EDI from the literature that
248 evaluate chronic exposure to RDCs. The EDIinh/ing derived for BTZs in this study was up to two orders of
249 magnitude above those estimated for employees near industrial sites in Spain 40 and exceeded dermal
250 exposure through textile (EDIdermal for ∑3BTZs = 244 – 395 pg/kg/day42). EDIinh/ing for PPDs and PPDqs
251 were up to 3.1 and 7.8-fold higher than EDIinh for near-roadside workers in Chinese megacities and two
252 orders of magnitudes higher than the EDIinh for the adult population in Hong-Kong37. EDIinh/ing for DPG
253 ranged from 0.01 – 8.61 ng/kg/day exceeding in most cases EDI via household dust ingestion in 11 countries
254 (0.0 – 0.9 ng/kg/day)34 (Table 3).

255 It is important to note that the EDIs reported in this study are relevant for climbers who visit during peak
256 hours. Aerosol PM concentrations in climbing halls vary greatly throughout the day, in correlation with the

257 number of visitors present4. Therefore, it can be expected that climbers visiting outside of peak hours will
258 have lower exposure to RDCs via inhalation of aerosol PM.

260 Engineered climbing shoes contain high quantities of rubber-derived compounds

261 Elevated RDC concentrations in the air of climbing halls and settled dust were not due to contamination,
262 ambient RDC levels, or sources such as climbing holds or mats, as confirmed by the blank and reference
263 sample data (Supplementary Text S5). We attribute the high concentrations of RDCs specifically to climbing
264 activity. Laboratory blanks showed only trace amounts of 2SH-BTZ and 2OH-BTZ in one out of four
265 samples. Collection and storage blanks contained low levels of 2SH-BTZ, 2OH-BTZ, BTZ, DPG, and IPPD
266 (Section S5). This is expected, as the blanks were prepared in the climbing halls, where RDCs were present
267 at high concentrations. Importantly, RDC levels in these blanks were at least an order of magnitude lower
268 than those measured in aerosol PM samples, confirming that the majority of RDCs in our samples were not
269 introduced via contamination.

270 In reference APM samples collected in offices of climbing Hall 02 (same building), where climbing is not
271 practiced, we detected 6PPD and IPPD (0.10 and 0.86 ng/m3 respectively, Section S5) in the combined LRT
272 + URT samples. This is consistent with expectations, as the concentrations of 6PPD and IPPD in these
273 reference samples (offices) are in the range of those reported in other indoor 28 and outdoor35,47,50,53–56
274 environments (Figure S1), implying that these RDCs are present at background levels, and not specifically
275 derived from climbing activity. On the other hand, BTZ, 2OH-BTZ, 6PPDq, IPPDq, DPG, aniline and
276 HMMM were not detected in the reference samples (Section S5).

277 Several potential climbing-related sources of RDCs were identified. IPPD was detected in one climbing hold
278 (66.0 ng/g), and in one of the mats measured (83.1 ng/g). IPPDq was detected in the same mat (5.8 ng/g,
279 Section S5). In contrast, dust samples contain <LOQ – 380 ng/g IPPD and <LOQ - 42 ng/g IPPDq. Climbing
280 holds and mats are made from durable materials with very low abrasion, so they likely did not contribute
281 substantially to the aerosol PM or settled dust present in climbing halls and no other RDCs were found in

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-r6t15-v5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7312-9145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

282 these items. Therefore, we concluded that another climbing related source must be the main contributor to
283 the high concentrations of RDCs measured in settled dust and aerosol PM samples.

284 All 15 RDCs were found in at least one of the thirty shoe sole samples screened. Concentrations were highly
285 variable between shoe models with cumulative RDC concentrations ranging from 25 to 3,405 µg/g (mean:
286 711 µg/g) (Figure 4, Table S4). 2SH-BTZ was the main constituent (mean: 538 µg/g) representing on
287 average 67% of the total mass of RDCs detected (Figure S3). BTZ, 2OH-BTZ and 2-amino-BTZ were
288 detected in lower concentrations (mean: 58, 53 and 3 µg/g, respectively). As in other rubber products, 2SH289 BTZ is likely used as a vulcanization accelerator during the curing process, while other benzothiazoles are
290 typically considered to be impurities or degradation products7,44. Unlike benzothiazoles, DPG and aniline
291 were not detected in every shoe sole sample, with concentrations ranging from <LOQ to 814 µg/g and <LOQ
292 to 225 µg/g, respectively. DPG is another vulcanization accelerator and may be used together with or instead
293 of 2SH-BTZ (shoe soles 18 19; Figure 4). p-Phenylenediamine compounds were detected in most shoe sole
294 samples in variable concentrations, with 6PPD and IPPD as the compounds with the highest concentrations
295 (mean: 1303 ng/g and 661 ng/g, respectively). Of the numerous PPDs available, 6PPD and IPPD are the
296 most commonly used rubber antiozonants45. CPPD and DPPD were only detected sporadically and at trace
297 levels (Table S4). The respective quinone transformation products, 6PPDq and IPPDq, were consistently
298 detected (mean: 23 ng/g and 15 ng/g, respectively) and as expected, their concentration in the samples were
299 correlated to the concentration of the parent compounds. CPPDq and DPPDq were also occasionally detected
300 along with their parent compounds at very low concentrations (Table S4). Overall, RDC concentrations in
301 shoe sole samples were highly variable and likely due to different compounding strategies used by
302 manufacturers as well as the target product characteristics (i.e., stiffness, durability, performance,
303 adhesiveness). RDC concentrations in shoe sole samples were generally lower (DPG and PPDs) or similar
304 (benzothiazoles) to those in tire tread7,44 but higher than in other elastomeric consumer products7.

Figure 4. Rubber-derived compound concentrations in climbing shoes and foothold powder. RDC
concentrations in thirty climbing shoe soles (left), and foothold powder from nine climbing halls (right).
Concentrations of RDCs vary substantially between different shoe models. Foothold powder samples are
representative of the variety of different shoe models.
306 Based on visual inspection and SEM imaging, foothold powder collected from the top of several climbing
307 footholds was comprised primarily of abraded climbing shoe soles, in contrast to settled dust samples, which
308 was more heterogenous in composition (Figures 1, 5). Variability in RDC concentrations between triplicate
309 foothold powder samples collected in one climbing hall was generally lower than for settled dust samples
310 (Table S4), due to its homogeneity. However, some variability was observed, most likely due to dilution of
311 the foothold powder samples with chalk or other dust. As these foothold powder (FP) samples were collected
312 in public climbing halls, where visitors wear a variety of different climbing shoe models, these samples were
313 highly representative of the variability found among individual shoe sole samples, both in terms of RDC
314 concentrations and profile (Figures 4, S2). The abrasion of shoe soles generates fine, elongated rubber

315 particles. These particles have the potential to become airborne over time, since it is common practice for
316 climbers to brush particles off holds. SEM images of foothold powder confirmed that while some rubber
317 particles are quite large (>100 μm) and unlikely to remain airborne, others fall within the <10 μm size range
318 (Figure 5) and could remain airborne long enough to be inhaled. A detailed assessment of the particle size
319 distribution of foothold powder was outside of the scope of this study. It has been previously shown that
320 abrasion of particles and fibers containing additives drives the chemical composition of indoor dust 46, and it
321 is highly likely that the fine rubber particles emitted via abrasion were captured by our air sampler. SEM
322 imaging confirmed that elongated particles, visually very similar to those in foothold powder, were present
323 in settled dust samples, including in the respirable size fraction (Figure 5). Based on the measurement of
324 RDCs in shoe sole and foothold powder samples, images of elongated rubber particles in settled dust, and
325 the lack of any alternative sources of RDCs in climbing halls, climbing shoes are most likely responsible for
326 the elevated RDC concentrations in climbing hall air and settled dust.

328 Transformations in indoor air implicate climbing shoes as the source of rubber-derived compounds

329 All settled dust and aerosol PM (combined LRT and URT fractions) samples had RDC profiles which
330 differed distinctly from shoe sole and foothold powder samples. Some target compounds were notably
331 absent, or very reduced in the chemical profiles of aerosol PM and settled dust, due to their lack of detections
332 in these samples (Figure 3, Table S4). For example, the mean fraction of 2SH-BTZ dropped from 48.0% in
333 the foothold powder samples to 1.2% in the settled dust and aerosol PM samples. At the same time, the
334 fractions of BTZ and 2OH-BTZ increased from 13.9% to 26.3% and 9.6% to 30.6%, respectively. Similarly,
335 the fraction of 6PPD dropped from 1.6% in the foothold powder samples to 1.1% in the settled dust and
336 aerosol PM samples, while the fraction of 6PPDq increased from 0.1% in the foothold powder samples to
337 4.7% in the settled dust and aerosol PM samples. The fraction of IPPD dropped from 0.8% to 0.4%, while
338 IPPDq increased from 0.02% to 0.03% (Figure 3, S3).

339
340 All observed shifts (2SH-BTZ → 2OH-BTZ + BTZ; 6PPD → 6PPDq; IPPD → IPPD-q) are likely the result
341 of transformation reactions on particle surfaces. The rubber particles collected in aerosol PM samples must
342 by virtue of the collection technique, exhibit small aerodynamic diameters with a correspondingly larger
343 surface area. Rubber particles present in the collected settled dust samples were also enriched in smaller
344 sized particulates after aerial transport (Figure 5). Such small particles have a high specific surface area,
345 which allows for rapid reactions with reactive species in the surrounding gas phase. Ozone, as well as
346 secondary species, such as the hydroxyl radical and NOX drive chemical reactions on particle surfaces in
347 indoor air47,48. In contrast, the foothold powder samples exhibited a lower specific surface area because of
348 the larger particle sizes (Figure 5) and, due to their continuous removal during climbing and brushing
349 activity, as well as regular replacement of the climbing holds, they were too pristine to have undergone
350 extensive transformation reactions prior to collection.

351 The chemical transformations observed here have been previously reported16,17,49,50. To confirm that these
352 transformations can also occur in rubber particles from climbing shoes, fast-ageing experiments were
353 conducted on foothold powder samples, using an ozone exposure chamber15. After four hours of exposure
354 to a high ozone concentration (1 g/m3), the chemical profile of the foothold powder samples shifted
355 substantially and corresponded to the chemical profile of the aerosol PM and settled dust samples (Figure
356 S5, S6, Table S5). It is important to note that the ozone concentrations used in these experiments are
357 significantly higher than what would typically be found in indoor climbing halls. Therefore, these
358 experiments do not conclusively demonstrate that the observed transformations result from reactions with
359 ozone, but they confirm that the RDCs in settled dust and aerosol PM samples are transformation products
360 of those present in foothold powder. Given enough time, it is possible that the same transformations would
361 occur in foothold powder at ambient ozone concentrations. However, it is unlikely that foothold powder
362 remains on climbing holds long enough for this to happen.

363 Transformation of 2SH-BTZ is well studied in the aquatic environment51, where 2OH-BTZ and BTZ are
364 frequently reported as transformation products, including when transformation is induced by ozone49,50. In
365 our ozonation experiments, the mean concentration of 2SH-BTZ decreased from 78 µg/g to 23 µg/g (p <
366 0.05), while the mean concentrations of 2OH-BTZ and BTZ increased from 15 µg/g to 17 µg/g (p > 0.05),
367 and 13 µg/g to 39 µg/g (p < 0.05) respectively. Likewise, it is well documented that PPDs react with ozone
368 to form PPD-quinones16,17,52, and the 6PPDq/6PPD ratio in crumb rubber has been related to the extent of
369 environmental weathering7. In our ozonation experiments, the mean 6PPDq/6PPD ratio increased from 0.04
370 to 0.12, and the mean IPPDq/IPPD ratio from 0.02 to 0.04. These changes were driven by decreasing 6PPD
371 and IPPD concentrations, although the decreases were not statistically significant, while 6PPDq and IPPDq
372 showed no significant changes in concentration. This likely reflects a balance between continuous formation
373 and further transformation of 6PPDq and IPPDq, since it is known that 6PPDq is not a stable end product of
374 6PPD ozonation, but undergoes further transformations53. The drops in 6PPD and IPPD concentrations likely
375 indicate formation of many transformation products other than 6PPDq and IPPDq 16,17,53. Our experiments
376 in conjunction with the body of literature reporting these ozone-induced transformations indicate that the
377 observed shift of RDC profile in our samples results from atmospheric transformations of the RDCs after

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-r6t15-v5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7312-9145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

378 generation of the rubber particles on the climbing holds. This explanation is further supported by the fact
379 that we did not find any significant alternative sources of the RDCs to aerosol PM or settled dust in climbing
380 halls.

381

382 Implications

383 In indoor climbing halls, concentrations of several RDCs substantially exceed previously reported values.
384 Total daily intake of RDCs for individuals visiting or working in these facilities exceeds exposure via all
385 other known routes. Indoor climbing is increasingly popular, with 6.36 million people participating in the
386 sport in the US in 2023 alone54, and climbing facilities worldwide likely employing many thousands of
387 individuals who may be exposed to high RDC concentrations in the workplace. The occupational exposure
388 of employees in the climbing shoe manufacturing sector also warrants further research.

389 The majority of the URT fraction of the collected aerosol PM would typically deposit in the nose and upper
390 airways, and is subsequently swallowed55. Aerosol PM from the LRT fraction has a higher probability of
391 deposition within deeper regions of the lung56. Thus, exposure to RDCs in climbing halls will be via both
392 the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. This study focussed on the sampling of particle-associated
393 RDCs and used an appropriate sampling device and analysis workflow. Due to the physico-chemical
394 characteristics of some RDCs (relatively high volatility and low octanol/air partition coefficient, Table S6),
395 it is possible that some compounds would diffuse from the rubber particles and also be present in the gaseous
396 phase in the air of climbing halls. In outdoor air, RDC partitioning was such that BTZ and 2OH-BTZ were
397 mainly found in the gas phase (70 and 95 %, respectively) but DPG, HMMM and all PPDs/PPDqs were
398 mainly found in the particulate phase (> 75 %)57. If this partitioning also holds true in indoor environments,
399 the overall (gas + particles) chemical burden in climbing halls air would substantially increase for BTZ and
400 2OH-BTZ and the human exposure to these RDCs would be higher than estimated here. It is well known
401 that indoor and outdoor partitioning differ, as the presence of many adsorptive materials such as mats, plastic
402 holds, or indoor dust can enhance adsorption. In fact, surface area to volume ratios are typically three orders
403 of magnitude higher in indoor than outdoor environments, which shifts partitioning to the particulate or

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-r6t15-v5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7312-9145 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

404 surface deposition phase47, resulting in lower concentrations of gaseous RDCs. Additionally, higher
405 concentrations of organic compounds in indoor air compared to outdoor air also shift partitioning and
406 enhance the probability of reactions with gaseous species47. The behaviour of RDCs and their fate in indoor
407 air requires further investigations.

408 It is essential to investigate the leaching kinetics of RDCs from aerosol PM, ideally in epithelial lung fluid409 and gastrointestinal fluid-mimetics. Further, the bioavailability of RDCs via different exposure routes, and
410 their toxicity should be investigated in greater depth. Aerosol PM-bound PPDs and PPDqs may contribute
411 to the oxidative potential of PM58. Oxidative potential of aerosol PM induces oxidative stress and
412 inflammation in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems59. Indeed, organic tire extracts and tire wear
413 particles have been shown to induce DNA damage, inflammation, and cell death in human lung cells8–10.

414 This study addressed only concentrations of particulate-associated RDCs, and did not account for gas phase
415 concentrations. Sampling, particularly of airborne particulate matter, was limited to a few climbing halls in
416 central Europe, and future studies should investigate whether RDC concentrations vary between climbing
417 halls in different countries. While our study provided compelling evidence that atmospheric transformations
418 shift rubber-derived compound profile in airborne particulate matter in climbing halls, the ozone
419 concentrations used in our ozonation experiments were higher than those typically encountered in real-world
420 conditions. It remains unclear whether ambient ozone and other reactive gas species concentrations could
421 induce the observed transformations.
422 Future research and regulatory efforts aimed at identifying alternatives for toxic RDCs, such as 6PPD, must
423 not overlook consumer products, such as climbing shoes, which contain a high additive content, and
424 dominate the human exposure for a subset of the population. A recent study found that while RDC
425 concentrations in a variety of rubber based consumer products are generally low, climbing shoes contain
426 significantly higher levels7. This contrast underscores that although rubber is widely used, only highly
427 engineered consumer products, such as climbing shoes and tires, contain a high additive content. The
428 observed variability in RDC concentrations in air across the five halls suggests that factors such as hall size,
429 check-ins per hour, and ventilation may directly influence indoor air quality. Studies assessing the

430 relationship between variables such as ventilation rate and RDC levels would help prioritize interventions
431 to reduce RDC levels in climbing halls.
