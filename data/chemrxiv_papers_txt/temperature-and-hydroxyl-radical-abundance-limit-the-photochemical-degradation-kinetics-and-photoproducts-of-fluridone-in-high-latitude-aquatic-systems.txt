Abstract
Temperature is often overlooked as an environmental driver of aquatic pollutant
photodegradation kinetics; however, it may strongly impact contaminant persistence in polar
climates characterized by low summertime temperatures and near-continuous sunlight. The
photochemical degradation of fluridone (FLU), an herbicide applied worldwide to waterways for
the eradication of invasive freshwater species, was investigated under simulated sub-arctic
conditions typical of high-latitude surface waters. Temperature had a strong effect on the
photochemical degradation of FLU, with half-lives for direct photochemical degradation ranging
from approximately 40 h at 22 °C to 118 h at 9 °C under constant irradiation. Assessment of

indirect processes involving reactive oxygen species indicated that FLU will primarily react with
hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and not singlet oxygen (1O2) produced by chromophoric dissolved
organic matter (CDOM) in the environment. These results were corroborated by Fenton
experiments, resulting in a calculated second order rate constant for the reaction with ·OH of
8.37 x 109 M-1 s-1. Photoproduct identification revealed four main pathways for direct and indirect
FLU photodegradation. Taken together, this work shows that direct photochemical degradation,
which is dominant, is temperature dependent. Also, the interplay between light screening and
·OH production of environmental CDOM, which is site dependent, will strongly influence FLU
persistence.

Synopsis
The persistence of aquatic pesticides in polar climates is poorly understood. This study reports
the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of fluridone photodegradation under environmentally
relevant temperatures and light regimes.

Introduction
In regions of the circumpolar North, persistence of environmental pollutants is a wellestablished issue due to the presence of cold temperatures1–5. Long residence times of
anthropogenic pollutants can cause chronic exposure to sensitive aquatic species, leading to
bioaccumulation of lipophilic toxicants. Therefore, the accurate forecasting of aquatic
persistence is paramount for managing water quality where pesticides are applied.
Fluridone (CAS 59756-60-4, FLU, Figure 1) is an herbicide applied to eradicate
freshwater macrophytes across the world. The application of FLU in high-latitude regions such
as Alaska is relatively new and has rapidly increased in popularity as climate change is affecting
invasive species proliferation in the sub-Arctic at alarming rates6,7 [X]. For instance, Elodea
canadensis has proliferated significantly, to the potential detriment of the world’s largest salmon
stocks in Alaska8. While FLU is seen as essential in combating invasive plants, FLU is
significantly more persistent in Alaska than in temperate climates; previous treatments in
Alaskan lakes noted >50% of initial applied herbicide existed 2 years following treatment9, still at
toxic levels. Low photochemical degradation rates and cold water temperatures were postulated
as the most likely driver of the long residence times9, but no studies have verified this.
Therefore, the fundamental photochemical behavior of FLU is of high interest in high-latitude
regions. Despite this acknowledgment by the manufacturer, no study to-date has identified the
temperature-dependent behavior of photochemical degradation, and which photochemical
pathways drive these kinetics.

Figure 1. Structure of the aquatic herbicide fluridone (CAS 59756-60-4, FLU). Molecular
formula: C19H14F3NO, KOW= 74 (20 ºC), Water solubility: 12 mg/L (pH 7, 25 ºC), pKa: 12.310.
Aquatic contaminants are known to photochemically degrade via direct and indirect
pathways. Direct photodegradation requires absorption of a photon by a molecule to induce
excitation and a chemical reaction. The direct photochemical pathway may also include
intersystem crossing to a triplet excitation state prior to decomposition, which can be influenced
by other indirect quenching or sensitizing processes. Indirect photodegradation is described by
numerous degradation pathways in which the contaminant reacts with photon-induced reactive
transient species such as hydroxyl radical (·OH), singlet oxygen (1O2), or triplet state
chromophoric dissolved organic matter (3CDOM*). As environmental factors such as
temperature, dissolved oxygen, and CDOM character vary across surface waters, the observed
degradation kinetics for FLU can be site-specific and difficult to predict11. While previous studies
have investigated the direct photochemical properties of FLU under laboratory settings12,13,
indirect processes have been relatively understudied and advances in non-target analysis using
high-resolution mass spectrometry now enable a robust analysis of degradation pathways.
The overall goal of this work was to assess the temperature dependence of direct and
indirect FLU photo-degradation pathways under simulated high-latitude summertime solar
conditions. Further, we aimed to detect and identify the primary photoproducts formed. This was
accomplished by illuminating solutions of FLU in the presence of probe molecules that isolate
the contributions of ·OH, 1O2, and 3CDOM*.

(Section S1).

2.1 Molar Absorptivity
High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection was used to
measure the molar absorptivity of FLU (𝜺FLU,𝞴 ; M-1 cm-1) as previously reported14–16. Briefly, 10
µL of solutions containing 500, 250, 80, 65, 35, and 10 µM FLU in methanol and water (80:20,
v/v) were injected into an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (3.0 x 50 mm; 2.7 µm) and
eluted isocratically with methanol and water (50:50, v/v) at a flow of 0.3 mL/min. The retention
time of FLU was 5.2 min. Absorbance spectra (205-800 nm) were recorded and blank spectra

were subtracted prior to baseline correction. Molar absorptivity was calculated as the slope of
the line obtained from Eq 1
area𝞴 = 𝜺FLU,𝞴 ᐧ (b ᐧ N ᐧ 6 x 10-7)/F

1

where area𝞴 is the peak area (mAU s) for wavelength 𝞴 (nm), b is the path length (cm), N is the
moles of FLU injected, F is the flow rate, and 6 x 10-7 combines the conversions from seconds
to minutes, mAU to AU, and mL to L. The peak area for each wavelength was calculated using
eq 2:
area𝞴 = A𝞴 ᐧ Δt ᐧ (A237 ᐧ Δt)/measured peak area for 327 nm

where A𝞴 is the absorbance (mAU) at wavelength 𝞴, A237 is the absorbance at 327 nm, and Δt is
the chromatographic peak width (s).

2.2 Degradation Experiments
The rate of FLU direct photochemical degradation under simulated solar radiation was
determined using microcosms (n = 4) containing 50 nM FLU in phosphate buffered water (5
mM, pH 7) with 0.1% acetonitrile (v/v). Additional microcosms (n = 4/treatment) were prepared
containing probe molecules in phosphate buffered water (5 mM, pH 7). Details for each
experiment, including the SunTest XLS+ solar simulator, are provided in the Supporting
Information (Section S2). The position-corrected first-order rate constants (j, h-1), half-lives (t1/2,
h), and apparent quantum yields (𝝓, AQY) for the photochemical degradation of FLU were
calculated for each treatment according to eq. 3-5:

𝝓 = (j Σ[𝜺2NB,𝞴 I𝞴])/(j2NB Σ[𝜺FLU,𝞴 I𝞴]) 𝝓2NB

where C0 and Ct are the initial concentration (nM) and concentration of FLU at time t (h),
respectively, FP is the actinometry correction factor, I𝞴 is the volume averaged photon flux (mol
photons L-1 s-1) at wavelength 𝞴 (nm), and 𝝓2NB is the quantum yield for the photoisomerization
of 2NB (𝝓2NB = 0.41)17. Rate constants from SRFA and SRHA containing treatments were
corrected for light screening by CDOM using eq. 6-8:

The activation energy (Ea; kJ mol-1), enthalpy of activation (ΔH‡; kJ mol-1), and entropy of
activation (ΔS‡; J mol-1 K-1) for direct, nitrate, and SRFA microcosms were calculated from the
slope of the Arrhenius equation (eq. 9), slope of the Eyring equation (eq. 10), and intercept of
the Eyring equation, respectively.

where T is the temperature (K), R is the ideal gas constant (J mol-1 K-1), kb is Boltzman’s
constant (J K-1), and h is Planck’s constant (J s).
Supplementary experiments (n = 4/treatment) were conducted to determine the
contributions of ·OH and 1O2 in the dark (Section S2). The second order rate constant for the
reaction of FLU with ·OH (kFLU,·OH; M-1 s-1) was determined from the slope of the line obtained by
plotting eq. 1118,19
ln([FLU]t/[FLU]0) = (kFLU,·OH kPhOH,·OH) ln([PhOH]t/[PhOH]0)

11

where kPhOH,·OH is the reported second order rate constant for the reaction of phenol with ·OH
(6.6 x 109 M-1 s-1)20.
Action spectra for the direct photochemical degradation of FLU (with and without light
screening by SRFA and SRHA CDOM surrogates) in the solar-simulator used in this experiment
were calculated using eq. 12.

The theoretical steady state concentration of ·OH ([·OH]ss; M) necessary to overcome light
screening by CDOM was calculated assuming an overall first order rate constant from eq. 13.

Quantitative methods for FLU, PhOH, and 2NB are provided in the Supporting
Information (Section S3). All rate constants, half-lives, and AQY are presented as the average ±
standard deviation (n = 4/experimental treatment, n = 3/control treatment). Statistical differences
were evaluated via analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Wilk-Shapiro test to confirm the
assumption of normally distributed residual error (W > 0.9) and posthoc Tukey honest significant
difference (HSD) comparisons (𝛼 = 0.05) using JMP Pro 16 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

2.3 Nontarget Photoproduct Identification
Degradation experiments for buffered direct and nitrate (1 mM) microcosms (n = 3/time
point/treatment) of FLU (1 µM) were repeated at 22 °C and the entire volume of each sample
(15 mL) was concentrated via Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Balance solid phase extraction (SPE,
Waters Oasis HLB, 500 mg, 6mL). Photoproducts were identified via a non-targeted analysis
using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution Orbitrap mass
spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap). The experimental details for sample collection, solid phase
extraction, and UHPLC-Orbitrap analysis parameters are available in the Supporting Information
(Section S4).

Results and Discussion
3.1 Molar Absorptivity and Direct Photochemical Degradation.
Molar absorptivity and all first-order rate constants for the degradation of FLU in this
study are tabulated in the Supporting Information (Tables S5 and S6). FLU has a single broad
absorption peak in the solar range, extending from 290 to 366 nm and peaking at 300 nm (𝜀300 =
12298 M-1 s-1) (Figure 2a, Table S5). Van Frost et al. (2024) also reported a broad absorption
peak overlapping with the solar spectrum, peaking at 282 nm (𝜀282 ≈ 11000 M-1 s-1, 𝜀300 ≈ 9700
M-1 s-1), consistent with previous observations that FLU will photodegrade when exposed to light
of wavelength less than 400 nm, and particularly less than 325 nm12,13.
The direct aqueous photochemical degradation of FLU was slow, with a measured halflife of 39.8 ± 0.9 h (j = 0.0174 ± 0.0004 h-1) at 22 °C. Neither addition of Cs+ (100 mM, t1/2 = 39.0
± 1.2 h, j = 0.0178 ± 0.0005 h-1) to promote intersystem crossing nor the triplet sensitizer 2acetonaphthone (2-AN, 10 µM, t1/2 = 39.7 ± 1.1 h, j = 0.0175 ± 0.0005 h-1) resulted in a
significant change in the photochemical degradation of FLU. This may be the result of rapid
forward and reverse intersystem crossing as observed for other pyridinone compounds, such as
acridones21. However, a slight yet significant increase in the rate was observed following argon
purging (t1/2 = 31.9 ± 3.0 h, j = 0.0219 ± 0.0021 h-1) (Figure 2b), consistent with Saunders and
Mosier (1983) in nitrogen purged water22. No degradation was observed in dark controls. Taken
together, these results indicate that intersystem crossing is minor and that the primary pathway
for the direct photochemical degradation of FLU proceeds from the singlet excitation state with
an apparent quantum yield of 1.20(±0.03)x10-4 at 22 °C. Previously reported quantum yields
ranged from 2.7x10-5 under UV-A irradiation22 to 3.8x10-4 at 311 nm11. Results from this study
fall within this range, with differences likely attributable to variability in irradiation wavelengths
and temperature (vide infra, Section 3.2) between experiments.

3.2 Temperature Dependence
Temperature had a direct effect on the photochemical degradation of FLU, with the halflife for direct photochemical degradation decreasing from 39.8 ± 1.2 h (j = 0.0174 ± 0.0004 h-1)
at 22 °C to 118.2 ± 8.4 h (j = 0.0059 ± 0.0004 h-1) at 9 °C, corresponding to apparent quantum
yields of 1.2 x 10-4 ± 2.8 x 10 -6 and 4.3 x 10-5 ± 3.0 x 10-6 (Figure 3a). The direct relationship
between temperature and photochemical degradation indicates that absorbance from a higher
vibrational level in the electronic ground state increases the probability of bond dissociation
upon excitation to the singlet state; similar to the simplified example provided by the potential
energy curves for the photo-dissociation of chlorine23. With respect to FLU, temperature likely
accelerates the cleavage of the biphenyl bonds (vide infra, Section 3.4) as these bonds, having
the least double bond character, are more likely to reach higher vibrational levels in the ground
state and promote photo-dissociation. Similarly, photochemical half-lives decreased from 21.3 ±
0.6 h (j = 0.0326 ± 0.0009 h-1) at 22 °C to 48.4 ± 2.2 h (j = 0.0144 ± 0.0006 h-1) at 9 °C and 27.6
± 0.6 h (j = 0.0252 ± 0.0006 h-1) at 22 °C to 63.1 ± 5.1 h (j = 0.0110 ± 0.0009 h-1) in nitrate and
SRFA containing microcosms, respectively.

Figure 3. A) Average pseudo first order rate constants (j, h-1, error bars denote one standard
deviation, n = 4) for the photochemical degradation of FLU in direct, NO3- (1 mM), and SRFA
(10 mg L-1) microcosms at 22 (gray bars), 14 (open bars), and 9 °C (hashed bars). Statistical
differences (p < 0.05, Tukey HSD) are denoted by different letter labels (A - C). B) Arrhenius
(black symbols) and Eyring (open symbols) plots for the temperature dependent degradation in
direct (squares), NO3- (circles), and SRFA (triangles) microcosms.
Calculated apparent activation energies for the degradation of FLU in nitrate (45 kJ mol-1) and
SRFA (47 kJ mol-1) microcosms were 13 - 15 kJ mol-1 lower than the measured activation
energy for the direct photochemical degradation of FLU (60 kJ mol-1) (Figure 3B & Table S4).
Apparent activation energies do not precisely measure the reaction of ·OH with FLU as
activation energies reported for the production of ·OH by both nitrate (16 ± 4 - 19 ± 4 kJ mol-1)
and SRFA (34.3 ± 7.2 kJ mol-1) confirm some temperature dependence for the production of
·OH in these systems24–26. Nevertheless, similar activation energies for FLU degradation in the
presence of nitrate and SRFA suggest a similar degradation mechanism, further supporting the
conclusion that reaction with ·OH will be the primary indirect pathway for degradation when
CDOM is involved. Similar trends were observed for the enthalpies of activation; however, the
magnitude of the entropies of activation for the degradation of FLU by ·OH (-130 and -125 J mol1
K-1 for nitrate and SRFA, respectively) was much larger than that measured for its direct
photodegradation (-85 J mol-1 K-1) (Table S7). The similarities between the two indirect systems
further support the case for a similar degradation mechanism and their discrepancy from direct
photodegradation may be attributable to the increased complexity of the indirect degradation
mechanisms added by the production of ·OH rather than 1O2, which was not observed to react
with FLU (vide infra, Section 3.3).

3.3 Indirect Photochemical Pathways
Follow-on experiments utilized select quenching and sensitizing reagents to investigate
the contribution of the reactive oxygen species 1O2 and ·OH to the indirect photochemical
degradation of FLU. The photochemical degradation of FLU was enhanced in the presence of

nitrate (1 mM, t1/2 = 21.3 ± 0.6 h, j = 0.0326 ± 0.0009 h-1) as well as SRFA (10 mg L-1, 4.5 mgC
L-1, SUVA254 = 4.4 L mg-1 m-1; t1/2 = 30.0 ± 0.7 h, j = 0.0231 ± 0.0005 h-1) and SRHA (10 mg L-1,
5.4 mgC L-1, SUVA254 = 5.3 L mg-1 m-1; t1/2 = 28.3 ± 0.7 h, j = 0.0245 ± 0.0006 h-1) after
correction for light screening (SwSRFA,280-365 = 0.8788, SwSRHA,280-365 = 0.7892, Figure 4a). Before
light screening correction, FLU degradation was not significantly accelerated in SRHA
microcosms. These results indicate that the interplay between light screening and ·OH
production by CDOM may have a significant impact on the persistence of FLU in the
environment. Addition of either isopropanol (IPA, 25 mM) as a ·OH scavenger or azide (1 mM)
as a 1O2 quencher to SRFA (t1/2 = 36.0 ± 1.3 h, j = 0.0192 ± 0.0007 h-1 and t1/2 = 33.7 ± 0.9 h, j =
0.0206 ± 0.0005 h-1, respectively) and SRHA (t1/2 = 34.6 ± 0.5 h, j = 0.0200 ± 0.0003 h-1 and t1/2
= 31.9 ± 0.9 h, j = 0.0217 ± 0.0006 h-1, respectively) microcosms reduced the rate of FLU
degradation. A greater reduction to the degradation rate with the addition of IPA, along with the
enhanced degradation rate with the addition of nitrate, support the conclusion that the presence
or absence of ·OH in the environment may significantly alter the persistence of FLU. Direct
photochemical degradation of FLU was not significantly altered by the addition of IPA (t1/2 = 42.5
± 0.8 h, j = 0.0163 ± 0.0003 h-1) while dark Fenton experiments (Figure 4b) revealed rapid FLU
degradation. The second order reaction rate constant, calculated relative to the degradation rate
of phenol (6.60 x 109 M-1 s-1)20, was 8.4(±0.9)x109 M-1 s-1. No degradation was observed with the
addition of only Fe(II) or hydrogen peroxide at pH 3. While FLU was observed to react with
nitrate radical at the elevated concentration of FLU used for photoproduct identification (vide
infra, Section 3.4), Fenton experiments confirmed that reaction with ·OH is a significant reaction
pathway.
FLU degradation was not observable in the presence of 1O2 generated by MoO42- and
H2O2, suggesting that 1O2 does not contribute to the degradation of FLU. Addition of azide,
however, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the direct photochemical degradation
rate (t1/2 = 45.7 ± 1.3 h, j = 0.0152 ± 0.0004 h-1). It is plausible for azide (E1/2 ·N3/N3- = 1.32 V) to
reduce the hypothetical radical cation formed by the photoionization of FLU27 (see discussion in
Section 3.4) to form the azide radical and regenerate FLU28–32, or quench FLU excited states
based on previous observations of 2-phenyl benzoxazole fluorescence33. Notably, a similar
decrease in the direct photochemical degradation of FLU was observed in deuterium oxide (t1/2
= 46.6 ± 0.9 h, j = 0.0149 ± 0.0003 h-1). The observed kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE; jH/jD =
1.17) may be attributable to an inhibition of photo-hydration34 or a proton coupled electron
transfer involving the radical cation discussed below (Section 3.4); however, neither mechanism
can be confirmed via the steady state experiments and photoproduct identification performed in
this work. A non-singlet oxygen based KSIE was previously observed to enhance the
photochemical degradation of diaryl amines via inhibition of radical cation reduction via H/D
coupled electron transfer with DOM phenols35. While separate mechanisms for the KSIE are
proposed for the direct photochemistry of FLU in this work than that previously described for the
photochemistry of diaryl amines, these results reinforce that caution be taken when using KSIE
for the interpretation of photochemical pathways potentially involving radical cation amines.

slope of each replicate was 8.4(±0.9)x109 M-1 s-1.
The molar absorptivity, AQY for the direct photolysis of FLU at 22 °C, and screening
factors for SRFA and SRHA, were used to calculate the action spectra for FLU under the
simulated solar light used in this work (Figure 5A). The single prominent absorption band
(Figure 2A) and peak in the action spectrum (Figure 5A) indicate that the quantum yield for the
direct photochemical degradation of FLU does not have a strong wavelength dependence.
Therefore, the AQYs presented in this work under simulated solar conditions are sufficient for
these calculations. The calculated half-life for the direct photochemical degradation of FLU (eq.
12) was 40 h and increased to 48 and 54 h with light screening by SRFA and SRHA. Based on
the second order rate constant for the reaction of FLU with ·OH, the theoretical steady state
concentrations of ·OH ([·OH]ss) required to overcome light-screening by SRFA and SRHA are
8.9x10-17 and 1.5x10-16 M, respectively (Figure 5B). Considering the steady state concentration
of ·OH in natural waters typically ranges between 10-18-10-15 M36–40, it is possible for this indirect
photochemical pathway to overcome light-shielding by CDOM depending upon the temperature
dependent quantum yield for the production of ·OH by CDOM and the concentration of other
·OH scavenging species. However, because the quantum yield for ·OH by CDOM is not close to
unity we can assume that it becomes increasingly unlikely that reaction with ·OH will accelerate
the overall observed degradation rate of FLU as light screening is increased and temperature is
decreased.

Photochemical degradation products for the predominant photochemical pathways,
direct and indirect reaction with hydroxyl radical were characterized. Structures are proposed
with up to Level 2b: Probable Structure (Diagnostic) confidence, according to the framework
established by Schymanski et al. (2014)41. Briefly, the proposed products are tentative
candidates with unambiguous molecular formula (Level 4) and fragmentation data (Level 3) with
evidence to support a proposed structure based on the known parent compound and
experimental context (Level 2b). Details for each proposed transformation product, including
structure, molecular formula, mass to charge ratio, mass error and retention time, are provided
along with chromatograms, fragmentation spectra, and abundance over time in the Supporting
Information for Transformation Products. Overall, 28 probable structures were identified that
were consistent with the photodegradation of FLU through four primary transformation
pathways: I) biphenyl bond cleavage 𝛼 to the ketone, II) N-demethylation, III) photohydration
and ring opening 𝛼 to the nitrogen, and IV) ring opening of the phenyl rings (Figure 6,

identified via UHPLC-Orbitrap analysis. I. biphenyl bond cleavage 𝛼 to the ketone, II. Ndemethylation, III. photohydration and ring opening of the pyridinone ring, and IV. ring opening
of the phenyl rings.
The primary photoproducts (or intermediates) identified in this study in both direct and
nitrate treatments were C12H11NO and C13H10F3NO, indicating Pathway I: loss of phenyl and
trifluoromethylphenyl groups after biphenyl bond cleavage 𝛼 to the ketone (Figure 6) is a major
pathway for both direct photolysis and reaction with ·OH. Notably, hydroxylated products of
these intermediates were also observed to form in the presence of ·OH (Supporting Information
for Transformation Products), indicating that bond scission may occur through homolytic
cleavage followed by H abstraction or reaction with ·OH to form a stable intermediate. Ndemethyl fluridone (C18H12F3NO, Fig 6, Pathway II) was another major product observed during
the direct photodegradation of FLU. This suggests that FLU may directly photoionize to a radical
cation and demethylate following proton transfer and hydrolysis of the resulting imine42–44. While
this work is the first to observe this pathway, likely due to the rapid degradation of the
demethylated intermediate (Figure 7), previous work has shown that aromatic amines in
aqueous solution can effectively eject an electron from the excited singlet state and that the
localized positive charge on the nitrogen was a key factor in their photoionization27. Based upon
the observations in this work that FLU primarily reacts from a singlet state, and a pKa of 12.3
resulting in the quaternary amine being the primary form of FLU under environmentally relevant
conditions, Pathway II is likely a major contributor to the overall photochemical degradation
observed in this work and others. Pathway III: photohydration and ring opening of the pyridinone
ring, either directly from FLU or following the loss of the phenyl group, resulted in another major
photoproduct - trifluoromethyl benzoic acid (C8H5F3O2) (Figure 6). Reaction with ·OH also

resulted in minor formation of oxidized photoproducts following phenyl ring opening in Pathway
IV, such as C15H12F3NO2 (Figure 6 & Supporting Information for Transformation Products);
however, these products were less abundant than those observed for Pathways I-III. Observed
intermediates for Pathways I, III, and IV were primarily formed via reaction at or nearer the nonsubstituted phenyl ring, consistent with the deactivating tendency of strongly electron
withdrawing trifluoromethyl substitution on aromatic rings.
Peak area vs time trends for major photoproducts (Figure 7) revealed further insights
into the photodegradation mechanism. Larger intermediates (C17-19) maintaining multiple
aromatic chromophores generally peaked in the first 24 hrs, then degraded by the end of the
treatment (4-8 days). This was especially true for the N-demethylated product C18H12F3NO
formed in the direct treatment, which was both rapidly formed and converted to other
compounds (Figure 7). Mid-size intermediates (e.g., C12H11NO, C13H10F3NO, C15H12F3NO2)
continued to form in the direct treatment as FLU continued to degrade, but generally depleted
after 24 hr in the NO3- treatment; suggesting that pyridinone ring opening to further products
(Supporting Information for Transformation Products) is accelerated by ·OH. Smaller
photoproducts (C5-9, e.g., C8H5F3O2) typically plateaued (or reached a steady-state) after 4 days
of exposure, showing signs of further degradation sooner in the NO3- treatment; consistent with
indirect photochemistry beginning to dominate as the aromatic chromophoric structures in FLU
are sequentially decomposed. Additional products gained -NO3 functional groups (Supporting
Information for Transformation Products) and continued to increase in concentration over the
duration of the experiment. These compounds are attributed to reaction with nitrate radical37,
and are not included in our discussion because they are unlikely to form under environmentally
relevant NO3- concentrations.
Previous studies identified similar photoproducts, along with additional small polar final
products that were not the target of our approach to capture a broad picture of unidentified
intermediates that would help elucidate degradation pathways. Muir et al. (1982) identified
desphenylfluridone (C13H10F3NO, Figure 6) as a major photoproduct, with extensive further
degradation to unextractable (w/ dichloromethane under acidic conditions) polar products being
the major degradation pathway45. Saunders and Mosier (1983) conducted a more extensive
study of fluridone photoproducts, also identifying the ring loss C13H10F3NO and C12H11NO
(Figure 6) but not in significant quantities, postulating that they were as photolabile as
fluridone22. This work identifies multiple pyridinone ring opening products of the desphenyl- and
destrifluoromethylphenyl- fluridone intermediates (Figure 6 & Supporting Information for
Transformation Products) that support this hypothesis; however, the Pathway I intermediates
were observed to plateau in systems where [·OH]ss was low, suggesting that they are less
photolabile than the parent FLU structure (Figure 7). Benzoic acid (C7H6O2) and 3(trifluoromethyl)-benzoic acid (C8H5F3O2), also observed in this study (Figure 6), along with
benzaldehyde (C7H6O), 3-(trifluoro-methyl)benzaldehyde (C8H5F3O), and N-methylformamide
(NMF, C2H5NO) were identified as primary products, along with significant volatilization losses.
While it is impossible to quantify these compounds without primary standards, decreasing
recovery of photoproducts over time in this work suggests the formation of smaller polar or
volatile photoproducts (such as NMF) not captured by SPE. These photoproducts suggested a
mechanism involving the complete degradation of the pyridinone ring, similar to results from
Shim (1967) who proposed that the photolysis of N-methyl-4-pyridinone proceeded by hydration

𝛂 to nitrogen followed by ring opening, though photoproducts could not be isolated in their
study46. Other studies searched for the formation of NMF in treated waters without success,
despite it being a primary photoproduct in lab studies47–49. Pyridinone ring opening pathways
observed in this study reveal potential mechanisms for the formation of NMF (e.g., Pathway III.
C17H11F3O3; Figure 6); however, multiple N-demethylated pyridinone ring opening products were
observed that preclude the exclusive formation of NMF and support its absence as a major
observed photoproduct (e.g., Pathway III. C10H8F3NO; Figure 6).

Figure 7. Relative peak area vs illumination time for the primary FLU photoproducts observed in
the buffered direct (A) and ·OH producing (B) systems. C8H5F3O2, C13H10F3NO, and C12H11NO
appear in both systems, while C18H12F3NO and C15H12F3NO2 were unique to the direct and ·OH
treatments, respectively.

Environmental Implications
This work quantifies the temperature dependence of FLU photochemical degradation,
with significantly slower degradation at lower temperatures providing a potential explanation for
the observed longer residence times of this aquatic herbicide in high latitude environments.
Activation energies measured in this work indicate that as temperature decreases, reactions
with ·OH may begin to contribute more to the overall degradation of FLU than direct
photochemical processes. Therefore, the interplay between light screening and ·OH production
by CDOM will likely result in site specific relevance of this pathway compared to direct
photochemical degradation. Pathways for the processes responsible for these kinetics were
determined via non-target analysis to aid in the interpretation of reaction mechanisms and
identification of transformation products that may accumulate as FLU degrades. Four primary

degradation pathways were identified with one unique to direct photochemistry (Pathway II: Ndemethylation), one unique to reaction with ·OH (Pathway IV: Phenyl ring opening), and two
common to both (Pathways I & III: biphenyl bond cleavage and photo hydrolytic pyridinone ring
opening). Photoproducts identified during this study can also facilitate future work on the
persistence and toxicity of FLU degradation products in aquatic environments.
