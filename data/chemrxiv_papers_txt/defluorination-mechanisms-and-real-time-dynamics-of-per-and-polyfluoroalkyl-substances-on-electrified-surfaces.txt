Abstract

3

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contam-

4

inants found in groundwater sources and a wide variety of consumer products. In

5

recent years, electrochemical approaches for the degradation of these harmful con-

6

taminants have garnered significant attention due to their efficiency and chemical-free

7

modular nature. However, these electrochemical processes occur in open, highly non-

8

equilibrium systems, and a detailed understanding of PFAS degradation mechanisms

9

in these promising technologies is still in its infancy. To shed mechanistic insight

10

into these complex processes, we present the first constant-electrode potential (CEP)

11

quantum calculations of PFAS degradation on electrified surfaces. These advanced

12

CEP calculations provide new mechanistic details on the intricate electronic processes

13

that occur during PFAS degradation in the presence of an electrochemical bias, which

14

cannot be gleaned from conventional DFT calculations. We complement our CEP cal-

culations with large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of

Introduction

26

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic compounds with strong C–F bonds

27

that endow them with exceptional chemical and thermal stability. Because of this intrinsic

28

stability, PFAS have been used in a variety of consumer products, such as packaging mate-

29

rials, non-stick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, surfactants, and firefighting foams. 1–4 Due

30

to their widespread use, PFAS contaminants have now been detected in soil/water sources

31

worldwide and can bioaccumulate in the food chain. The persistence of these environmental

32

pollutants is particularly concerning, since chronic exposure to even low concentration levels

33

has been associated with adverse health effects. Because of their environmental persistance

34

and toxicity, finding efficient approaches to eliminating these contaminants is essential.

35

Among the various oxidation/reduction processes 5–11 used for PFAS remediation, electro-

36

chemical approaches have garnered particular attention due to their efficiency and chemical-

37

free modular nature. 12 In these electrochemical processes, an external bias voltage is applied

38

to an electrolytic solution of PFAS contaminants, which facilitates electron transfer and sub-

39

sequent PFAS degradation on the electrified surface of the electrode. More specifically, at the

40

electrode-electrolyte interface, PFAS molecules interact with both the electrode surface and

41

the solvent. This interface (by definition) is an open, non-equilibrium thermodynamic system

42

that exchanges matter and energy with its surroundings and facilitates electrochemical re-

43

actions driven by the potential difference between the electrodes and the electrolyte. Due to

44

the inherent complexity of these electrochemical processes, a detailed understanding of PFAS

45

degradation mechanisms in these complex environments is scarce and still in its infancy. 13–16

46

For example, the choice of electrode material, electrolyte composition/concentration, tem-

47

perature, and external bias are all experimental conditions that can be modified, but it is not

48

obvious which combinations of these parameters are optimal for PFAS degradation. More-

49

over, since the entire electrochemical system is under an external bias, conventional density

50

functional theory (DFT) in its standard formulation (discussed further below) cannot be

51

used, since the system is open and driven far from equilibrium. 17 To shed mechanistic in-

52

sight into these electrochemically-induced processes, we present the first constant-electrode

53

potential (CEP) quantum calculations of PFAS degradation on electrified surfaces. The ap-

54

plication of CEP quantum calculations to electrochemically-induced PFAS degradation is

55

particularly novel since traditional DFT methods are inherently constrained to a fixed num-

56

ber of electrons and cannot capture realistic electrochemical conditions where there is a facile

57

exchange of electrons with the electrode. Our CEP calculations go beyond this limitation by

58

modifying the conventional DFT formalism to allow electrons to be freely supplied/removed

59

from the system (via the electrode potential), which accurately simulates a realistic electro-

60

chemical interface. This approach allows us to simulate the true grand-canonical thermo-

61

dynamic ensemble of electrons, capturing the critical Fermi-level fluctuations that govern

62

the complex reactivity in these electrochemical systems. We describe our approaches for

63

simulating these complex, non-equilibrium processes, followed by a variety of analyses and

64

real-time dynamics that explain the underlying mechanisms of the electrochemically-induced

65

degradation process. Finally, we conclude with a discussion and summary of our results, with

66

additional perspectives on future applications of our CEP-based techniques that can have a

67

broad impact on electrochemical degradation of PFAS.

Methods and Materials

69

We investigated PFAS degradation reactions in the presence of a constant-electrode potential

70

(CEP) 18 using a locally modified Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 19,20 code with

71

the VASPsol 21,22 implicit solvation model. In the CEP model, density functional theory 23,24

72

(DFT) calculations with varying numbers of electrons are iteratively carried out for the

73

entire chemical system in the presence of an implicit electrolyte. It is worth emphasizing

74

that these CEP calculations go beyond the conventional canonical DFT formalism since the

75

entire system is open (i.e., a grand canonical thermodynamic system), and the total number

76

of electrons in the system is iteratively adjusted until the Fermi level, EF , converges to the

77

applied electrode potential, U (in volts). A solution for the CEP system is obtained when

78

the following expression is self-consistently satisfied:

U=

−EF − ϕSHE
,
e

(1)

79

where ϕSHE = 4.6 eV is the work function of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as

80

calculated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 25 functional in the VASPsol model, and

81

e is the elementary charge. We used a 0.01 eV convergence criterion for the electrolyte-

82

referenced Fermi level to solve Eq. (1) self-consistently.

83

We investigated a protonated PFOA (C7 F15 COOH) molecule adsorbed on an electrode

84

surface, which was modeled with a 4-layer, 5×5 Cu(111) slab. The Cu(111) surface was

85

specifically chosen for our studies since Cu is one of the most widely used transition metal

86

catalysts (due to its abundance and low cost), and the Cu(111) surface is one of the most well-

87

studied metal surfaces in both experimental and theoretical studies. 26 We also carried out

88

additional calculations with larger slabs and verified that the 5×5 Cu(111) slab used in our

89

work was sufficiently large enough to give accurate results. The PFOA molecule was adsorbed

90

on the Cu(111) surface in the lowest-energy “flat” configuration 27 where the plane of the car-

91

bon backbone is parallel to the surface. To avoid spurious interactions between the adjacent

chemical species in repeated supercells, a ∼25 Å vacuum spacing was used along the surface

93

normal. In the remainder of this work, we denote this supercell as PFOA/Cu(111), which

94

has 1,850 valence electrons. Both static (i.e., single point/structural relaxation) and molec-

95

ular dynamics 28 DFT simulations were carried out with periodic boundary conditions under

96

a fixed electrode potential with projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. 29,30 We

97

used a Debye length of 3.0 Å in the VASPSol package, which corresponds to a bulk electrolyte

98

with a 1 M concentration of monovalent cations and anions and a relative permittivity of

99

the solvent of 80 for water at ambient conditions. The dispersion-corrected PBE-D3 31 func-

100

tional with a 520 eV cutoff energy was used for the plane-wave expansion. The optimized

101

structure of PFOA/Cu(111) is illustrated in Fig. S1 of the Supporting Information (SI). The

102

Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2×2×1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh; the electronic energy and

103

forces were converged to within 1 × 10−6 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. During the simu-

104

lations, the bottom layer of the Cu electrode was held fixed at the optimized bulk structure.

105

The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed at 300 K with the

106

Nosé-Hover thermostat. 32

108

Using the optimized supercell geometries depicted in Fig. S1 in the SI, we carried out CEP

109

ionic-relaxation and AIMD calculations for several values of the applied bias to study PFOA

110

degradation dynamics on the electrified electrode surfaces.

114

+3 V) with respect to the SHE, and Fig. S2 in the SI shows the optimized structure

115

of the PFOA/Cu(111) supercell from these CEP ionic-relaxation calculations. Fig. 1(a)

plots the converged total number of electrons, Ne (left vertical axis; hollow circles), and

117

Fermi level, EF (right vertical axis; solid circles), for the CEP ionic-relaxation calculations

118

for PFOA/Cu(111) as a function of the applied electrode potential. At 0.0 V, the CEP-

119

optimized geometry (illustrated on the lowest snapshot of Fig.1 (a)) shows a minor structural

120

deviation from the initial PFOA/Cu(111) geometry (see panels Figs. S1(a) and (b) in the

121

SI) However, when +1.0 V is applied, the plane of the carboxyl (−COOH) group rotates

122

and moves the carbonyl oxygen/hydroxyl group closer to/farther from the surface plane (see

123

Fig. S2(b) in the SI). This positive voltage effectively reduces Ne by almost 3 electrons to

124

1846.9 e− and shifts EF downward to -7.8 eV. At a potential of +2.0 V, the carbonyl oxygen

125

forms a bond with the copper surface, and the hydroxyl group dissociates. The liberated

126

hydrogen atom subsequently binds to an on-top site on the Cu(111) surface (see Fig. S2(d)

127

in the SI). Further increasing the potential to +3.0 V effectively removes nearly 17 electrons

128

from the neutral reference system and triggers the migration of the hydrogen atom to a

129

hollow site on the Cu(111) surface (see Fig. S2(f) in the SI). Apart from this deprotonation

130

reaction, no additional degradation pathways for PFOA were identified at potentials up to

131

+3.0 V. Increasing the potential beyond this limit results in extremely difficult convergence

132

of the CEP calculations since the depletion of electrons creates a large positive charge in the

133

periodic cell, which is unphysical. Our findings are also consistent with several experimental

134

studies showing that oxidation processes at positive applied voltages can be less efficient than

135

reduction processes (which occur at a negative applied bias) for degradation of PFAS. 13–16

136

Turning our attention to negative voltages, Figs. S2(c, e, and g) in the SI show that the

137

carboxyl group plane in PFOA rotates in the opposite direction compared to the geometries

138

obtained under positive voltages. As shown in Fig. 1(a), negative biases result in more

139

electrons introduced into the PFOA/Cu(111) supercell (compared to the zero-bias state

140

with Ne = 1850.0 e− ), which accelerates PFOA defluorination via excess electrons in this

141

reductive process. This phenomenon also manifests itself in the increasing Fermi level as the

142

voltage is decreased, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We observed no significant structural changes in

143

PFOA for voltages more positive than -3.0 V; however, at this critical value of the bias, the

144

CEP ionic-relaxation simulations show the dissociation of a C−F bond located at the C2

145

carbon (carbon-atom numberings in this work, i.e., C2 or C6, are denoted by their distance

146

from the carboxyl head group); see structure on the middle left side of Fig. 1(a). This

147

agrees well with previous experimental findings that indicate C–F bond cleavage occurs at

148

potentials close to -3.0 V. 11,33,34

149

To further understand the effects of applying a negative potential to the system, we

150

carried out a Bader charge analysis 35,36 for the PFOA/Cu(111) system at 0.0 (Ne = 1849.8

151

e− ) and -3.0 V (Ne = 1856.9 e− ). This analysis reveals that approximately 68% (∼4.8

152

e− ) of the 7.1 additional electrons in the cell at -3.0 V are retained within the Cu(111)

153

surface slab, while about 32% (∼2.3 e− ) are transferred to PFOA. Figs. 1(b) and (c) show

154

the results of the Bader charge analysis for the PFOA/Cu(111) system at applied electrode

155

potentials of 0.0 and -3.0 V, respectively. The numerical labels on each atom denote their

156

Bader net atomic charges, which are determined by the difference between the number of

157

valence electrons and the Bader population associated with that atom. At 0.0 V, the nearly

158

neutral PFOA consists of 15 negatively charged F atoms (-0.6 e) on the carbon backbone.

159

In contrast, the carbon atoms have charges ranging from +1 to +1.8 e and are connected

160

to a carboxyl group with negatively-charged oxygen atoms and a +0.5 e-charged hydrogen

161

atom. This analysis reflects the well-known partial ionic character of the C−F bond where

162

the high electronegativity of fluorine creates a partial positive and negative charge on C and

163

F, respectively. Upon application of a negative voltage of -3.0 V, dramatic changes occur

164

within the PFOA molecule. The positive charge on the H atom decreases to +0.1 e as it gets

165

closer to the surface. Moreover, the C2 carbon atom experiences a significant decrease to

166

+0.3 e, and the external voltage leads to cleavage of the C2–F bond. As a result, a negatively

167

charged fluoride ion (F− ) is released from the molecule and migrates into the surrounding

168

electrolyte solution.

of an applied bias, we used the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis in

171

the LOBSTER 37 software package. In the COHP formalism, bonding, non-bonding, and

172

antibonding interactions are identified for pairs of atoms in a given structure, and the inte-

173

grated value of the crystal orbital bond index (ICOBI) equals the chemical bond order. The

174

upper panel of Fig. 2 depicts the evolution of the C2–F bond length (RC−F , left vertical axis)

175

and the total number of electrons (right vertical axis) throughout the 750 ionic steps of the

176

CEP ionic-relaxation calculation at -3.0 V. The lower panels of Fig. 2 report the projected

177

crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) bonding analysis of the C2–F bond at six

178

different lengths (denoted as solid blue circles on the bond length vs. ionic steps curve) as a

179

function of energy. For each bond length, the value of the chemical bond order is reported

180

under the associated pCOHP curve in which the Fermi level (EF ) lies at zero eV, and the

181

left (blue)/right (green) sides are the anti-bonding/bonding distributions, respectively. At

182

the first ionic step (RC−F = 1.367 Å and Ne = 1850.0 e− ), the bond order of 0.80 indicates

183

a weaker bond compared to a pure single bond with an order of 1.0. This suggests that

184

the bond is less stable and more susceptible to breaking under the applied bias as the ionic

185

relaxation simulation progresses. In the associated pCOHP curve, the presence of C−F an-

186

tibonding states near the Fermi level signifies electronic instability within the system. At

187

the 100th ionic step (RC−F = 1.612 Å and Ne = 1855.9 e− ), the bond order has significantly

188

decreased to 0.49, indicating a further weakening of the bond. The pCOHP plot shows that

189

this bond weakening is accompanied by an increase in antibonding interactions below the

190

Fermi level. While the antibonding states vanish at the Fermi level by the 125th ionic step

191

(RC−F = 2.460 Å and Ne = 1856.7 e− ), the electronic instability persists. This persistence is

192

attributed to the presence of populated antibonding states, which gradually diminish as the

193

simulation progresses towards the 150th step (RC−F = 3.868 Å and Ne = 1856.8 e− ). At this

194

point, the bond order reaches zero, signifying a complete bond dissociation. Elongation of

195

the C2–F bond during the ionic relaxation process leads to the complete depletion of occu-

196

pied antibonding states. By the final ionic step (RC−F = 6.494 Å and Ne = 1856.9 e− ), the

Fermi level in the pCOHP curve resides within a gap between the bonding and antibonding

regions, which signifies a stable non-bonding state for the C2–F bond in the system.

Real-Time PFAS Degradation Dynamics on Electrified Electrode Surfaces

201

While the previous CEP ionic-relaxation calculations provide mechanistic information into

202

the PFAS degradation process, they only give a single, time-independent snapshot of the

203

degradation process near an equilibrium structure at zero Kelvin.

204

dependent picture of the degradation dynamics, which also accounts for temperature effects,

205

we carried out computationally-intensive CEP AIMD simulations of PFOA degradation on

206

the Cu(111) surface. These AIMD simulations inherently explore a broader configurational

207

and energetic landscape for the PFAS degradation process, whereas the CEP ionic-relaxation

208

calculations are constrained to an initial geometry and can only explore configurations near

209

the local energy minimum. Using the same PFOA/Cu(111) structure shown in Figs. S1(a)

210

and (b) in the SI as an initial geometry, CEP AIMD calculations were carried out at -

211

3.3 V for a duration of 1,307 fs. The SI provides a movie of the degradation dynamics

212

of PFOA/Cu(111) and Figs. 3(a) and (b) show the final decomposed structure of PFOA

213

obtained from our CEP AIMD calculations, The evolution of all 15 C−F bonds in PFOA

214

during the CEP AIMD simulation is depicted in the inset of Fig. 3(c). At ∼1250 fs, the

215

C5–F and C6–F bonds begin to stretch (by 35% and 73%, respectively) until they effectively

216

dissociate, leading to the release of F atoms from the molecule and migration into the sur-

217

rounding electrolyte solution. It is worth mentioning that we also carried out conventional

218

AIMD calculations (which only allows a fixed number of electrons due to its closed-system

219

nature) of PFOA on CU(111), and no bond dissociation of any kind was observed. In

220

contrast, our CEP-based AIMD calculations clearly show the dissociation of C–F bonds in

221

PFOA at -3.3 V, which demonstrates the new capability of the CEP approach for capturing

222

electrochemically-induced bond-breaking processes.

223

Taken together, our quantum calculations corroborate several previous experimental and

224

computational observations on PFAS degradation. For example, our CEP AIMD calcula-

225

tions at -3.3 V naturally predict the dissociation of the C5–F and C6–F bonds in PFOA,

226

which were previously identified as having the lowest bond dissociation energies in a joint ex-

227

perimental/computational study (see Fig. 3(d) in Ref. 38). In addition, our ionic relaxation

228

simulations predict that a C–F bond in PFOA dissociates at an applied external potential

229

of -3.0 V, which aligns well with experimental findings. 33 Finally, our quantum calculations

230

enable a Bader charge analysis to predict the distribution of electrons in PFAS, which pro-

231

vides insight into how charge is transferred to these contaminants in electrified environments

232

to enable subsequent degradation reactions.

233

In conclusion, we have carried out the first constant-potential simulations of PFAS

234

reactions on electrified surfaces to probe their degradation dynamics under realistic non-

235

equilibrium conditions. These advanced CEP calculations provide new mechanistic details

236

of PFAS degradation in an open system under an electrochemical bias, which cannot be

237

gleaned from conventional DFT calculations. Specifically, our CEP calculations show that

238

C–F anti-bonding states near the Fermi level (i.e., the chemical potential of the system)

239

emerge when the system is placed under a negative bias. This subsequently causes the C–F

240

bond to dissociate until the system reaches a stable non-bonding state where the bonding

241

and anti-bonding states of PFAS are energetically separated. To provide time scales for this

242

complex process, we also carried out large-scale CEP AIMD calculations of PFOA degrada-

tion on an electrified Cu(111) surface, which show that defluorination occurs within 1,307

244

fs when the system is placed under a negative bias of -3.3 V. Taken together, these CEP

245

calculations enable a new capability for predicting reactions and time-resolved PFAS degra-

dation mechanisms under realistic, non-equilibrium, electrochemical conditions. Specifically,

247

our open-system quantum calculations enable predictions of chemical reactivity and eluci-

249

these predictive CEP approaches hold immense promise for pre-screening candidate mate-

rial surfaces and predicting optimal electrochemical conditions/biases to guide experimental

251

efforts in remediating PFAS and other emerging environmental contaminants. For example,

252

our computational approach can facilitate the exploration of alternative electrode materials

253

such as boron-doped diamond (BDD), lead oxide (PbO2 ), and tin oxide (SnO2 ) to provide

254

mechanistic insight into PFOA oxidation and defluorination mechanisms on these different

255

surfaces. Additionally, our approach can also be used to investigate the effect of electrolytes

256

on PFAS degradation, which can further be used to improve treatment processes. Exploring

257

all of these various aspects with our computational approaches can assist PFAS researchers

258

in rationally down-selecting promising electrode materials and electrolytes to enhance the

259

efficiency of experimental degradation strategies.
