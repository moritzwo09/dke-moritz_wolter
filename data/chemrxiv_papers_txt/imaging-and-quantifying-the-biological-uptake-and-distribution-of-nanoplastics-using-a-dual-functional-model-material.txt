Abstract
Nanoplastics (NPs) are invisible to human eyes yet pose significant concerns to human health
due to their wide environmental presence and high potential for biological uptake, transport, and
accumulation. Conventional analytical methods suffer from low accuracy and precision in NP
detection due to their limited reliability and quantitative ability. To address these challenges, we
developed a dual-functional model NP that allows for in-situ imaging by surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and ex-situ quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS). In this study, the model NP has a core-shell structure with Raman
reporter-functionalized gold nanoparticles as the core and a layer of plastic as the shell. The gold
core can enhance the Raman reporter signals and make model PS detectable, which can be used
to visualize the uptake of the model NP in plant tissue by SERS. Meanwhile, the model NP
particle numbers in the collected plants can be quantified by ICP-MS based on the presence of
gold in the core. The model PS demonstrated stability in structure, size, and surface charges over
one year, with no indication of chemical leaching. In this study, garlic plants were used as our
experimental matrix to evaluate the potential of the dual-functional model PS for application in
living organisms. Our aim was to determine whether the model PS in the garlic plants could be
effectively quantified and qualified by SERS and ICP-MS. Garlic plants were grown in various
concentrations of model NP suspensions for a 30-day period. The results showed that the NP
uptake was concentration-dependent with higher concentrations of model NP leading to higher
uptake by the garlic roots. The study also investigated the changes in NP uptake over time,
showing that longer NP exposure resulted in more NP uptake in garlic roots. The study also
demonstrated the effective coordination between SERS and ICP-MS. In cases where SERS had
limitations in detecting the presence of model PS, ICP-MS proved capable of facilitating

NP for studying NP behavior with SERS and ICP-MS in living organisms, which holds

1. Introduction
Plastics are highly demanded in human’s daily life and numerous applications of plastics are
used nowadays and every day. Including fields such as agriculture,1 healthcare,2 construction,3
packaging,4 and textiles,5 plastics find widespread use in various sectors.6 Massive amounts of
plastics have the potential to be released into the environment due to the broad applications and a
low recycling rate.7,8 When entering the environment, plastics can undergo degradation into
smaller pieces through certain processes such as mechanical abrasion,9 UV exposure,10 and
biological degradation.11,12 They can break down the larger plastics into tiny particles measuring
1 to 100 nm, which are defined as nano plastics (NPs).13 The presence of a large number of NPs
has been identified in the soil and surface water,14 and it has been proved that NPs are
accumulating in the environment.15 The concern is that NPs can contaminate irrigation water,
leading to the contamination of crops with NPs. According to a recent study, it has been found
that NPs can circulate in the environment and accumulate in the plants that humans consume.16
The introduction of NPs into the food chain can affect food safety and human health due to the
toxicity of these NPs.17
Given the presence of NPs in surface water, there is a high likelihood that crops may come into
contact with NPs through root or foliar contact during irrigation. In fact, the levels of plastic
particle contamination in terrestrial ecosystems can be 4-23 times higher than those found in
marine systems, as per studies.18,19 However, NP contamination in terrestrial ecosystems has
been overlooked before, only gaining attention in the last few years. A recent study revealed that
plant roots can uptake NPs, leading to their accumulation within the plants.20 Another study

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zt155-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

discovered the capability of NPs to translocate within plants. The initial contamination occurred
through foliar contact on the leaves, and subsequently, the NPs were transported to the roots. 21
Should crop seeds become contaminated with NPs, the contamination is likely to extend to the
roots, stems, and leaves of the plants.22 Furthermore, it has been found the accumulation of NPs
could have a significant impact on the growth and development of plants.23 This has made people
more interested, especially when it comes to improving agricultural yield. To identify NPs in
plants, various techniques are commonly used, with microscopic and light scattering methods
being among the most common techniques for qualitative detection. These methods include
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence
microscopy (FM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Polystyrene (PS) has been identified as
the most prevalent NP in various ecosystems and is the most detected type within the food
chain.24 In researching the uptake and distribution of NPs in plants, many studies have used
fluorescent dye-labeled PS NPs as a model to simulate the behavior of NPs within the plant.22,23
However, one of the drawbacks of using fluorescent dye-labeled NPs is the negative
environmental impact. The introduction of fluorescent dye-labeled NPs into ecosystems may
have unintended environmental consequences. Secondly, it might alter the surface properties of
NPs, affecting their interactions with plants and the environment in ways that differ from
unlabeled NPs.(Fig. S3) Additionally, the release of fluorescent dye from NPs could impact the
accuracy of results and lead to false signals.25 When studying the distribution of NPs in plants,
uncertainty arises regarding whether plants uptake the dye or the NPs. Studies have revealed that
NPs can negatively influence crop growth.26,27 However, when using dye-labeled NPs, it remains
uncertain whether it is the dye or the NPs themselves that have an impact. Lastly, biological
autofluorescence has the potential to interfere with the fluorescent dye.28,29 A novel model of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zt155-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

NPs without fluorescent dye is needed to overcome these limitations. However, microscopic
imaging techniques can only qualitatively analyze a small fraction of plant tissue. The result is
not able to represent the whole plant. Developing a non-destructive method to detect NPs in
plants poses a challenge. For novel detection methods, some radioisotope techniques have been
previously performed to study the distribution and fate of plastics in crop plants, but radioactive
substances have always been a concern when dealing with living organism samples. 30 The
challenge is to find a method to real-time detect NPs in living biological samples without
damaging the tissues. A detection method model capable of both quantitative and qualitative
measurement of NPs is essential for studying the uptake mechanism and tracing the behavior of
NPs in biological samples.
The objective of this study is to develop a dual-model PS NP material that doesn’t contain
fluorescence dye capable of enabling in situ quantification and qualification detection in plants.
This material enables qualitative imaging and quantitative assessment of the biological uptake
and transport of NPs in plants, as well as their impact on plant growth. Garlic plants were
specifically chosen and exposed to model NP suspension for this research, as garlic is a widely
consumed food by humans. Subsequent steps involve imaging and quantifying the model NPs in
garlic plants by model detection methods. A new analytical model of NP detection was
developed in this study. This detection model combines Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
(SERS) with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). SERS was used for
imaging NPs in garlic plants, providing insights into the presence of NPs within different parts of
garlic plants. Furthermore, ICP-MS was used to quantitatively assess the model NP particle
numbers in different parts of garlic plants, including the roots and the upper part of garlic plants.
This serves to validate the SERS imaging results and provide more accurate quantitative data that

may not be detectable through SERS alone. This combination of analytical techniques facilitates
the investigation of the uptake and distribution of model NPs in garlic plants. 31The reliable
SERS imaging approach makes deep tissue detection possible and can also study the behavior
and impact of NPs on biological samples with model NPs in the future. Using the dual-model
material and detection method to detect model NPs enables a comprehensive understanding of
the uptake and distribution of NPs in edible plants. This model material and detection method is
suitable for future studies of NPs in biological samples. This knowledge contributes to assessing
the potential risks to food safety and human health.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
The synthesis of the model NP utilized the same materials and protocol as described in our
previous study.32 All chemicals were purchased from either Fisher Chemical or Sigma Aldrich.

2.2 Preparation of NPs
In brief, the model NPs feature a core-shell structure, with a gold nanoparticle (nAu) at the core.
A SERS nanotag called 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) is labeled on the gold core.
Surrounding the gold core is a PS shell, forming the core-shell structure of the model PS NP. The
initial step involves producing citrate-stabilized gold seeds using sodium citrate and
HAuCl4·3H2O which are then used for further synthesis of nAu. Next, the gold seeds are added
to an HCl solution and mixed with HAuCl4·3H2O. Simultaneously, the freshly prepared ascorbic
acid solution is added, allowing the reaction to proceed for 30 seconds while stirring with a
magnetic stir bar. The suspension is then centrifuged to remove the supernatant and stored in the
refrigerator (4 ℃) for future use.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zt155-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

The second step entails labeling the gold core with the SERS nanotag. The gold enhances the
nanotag signal, allowing the NP to be detected by Raman spectroscopy. 4-MBA was chosen for
its sharp characteristic SERS peak and ability to form covalent bonds with gold, preventing
leakage. First, add NaOH to the nAu suspension to prevent aggregation. Then, add 4-MBA in
ethanol to the suspension and allow it to incubate for 10 minutes. To remove excess 4-MBA
molecules, the suspension is centrifuged. The supernatant is discarded, and the particles are
resuspended in ultrapure water.
To ensure that the model NP retains its plastic properties, we coated the nAu with a PS layer.
This ensures that the behavior of the model NP remains consistent with that of plastic. Using a
bottom-up synthesis method, we used a wet chemical approach to cat the PS layer. The size of
the model NPs can be controlled by extending the reaction time. The final model NPs were
centrifuged and resuspended in ultrapure water.

2.3 Garlic plant cultivation and NP exposure
To evaluate the possibility of using this dual-functional model NPs and detection method, we
selected garlic plants as the matrix for our study. To start the study, garlic bulbs with peels were
purchased from a local grocery store. The garlic bulbs were then peeled and grown in varying
concentrations of NP suspension until they generated roots and shoots. Subsequent steps involve
imaging and quantifying the model NPs in garlic plants by model detection methods.
Fresh garlic bulbs were purchased from a nearby grocery store. First, 20 cloves were peeled and
subsequently placed into 20 20 mL Amber glass vials. Cloves were selected based on their
similar weights to ensure accuracy in the experiment. To expose garlic to NPs, 2 mL of diluted
NP suspensions was initially added on day 1 to each vial. The exposure concentration of PS NP
suspensions was determined according to the actual concentration observed in surface water

systems. In surface water systems, a study detected the highest concentration of PS NPs at
1.02×1015 particles/mL.33 However, concerning the uptake of PS NP by plants from irrigation
water, the concentration could potentially be exponentially lower. Considering the detection limit
of SERS and its relevance to agriculture, we aim to maintain the concentration of PS NP
suspensions as low as possible while still being detectable by SERS. The concentrations of NP
suspensions included 0 particles/mL, 2×109 particles/mL, 2×1010 particles/mL, and 2×1011
particles/mL. Each concentration was subjected to five replicates for experimental validity. The
garlic plant samples were placed and grown inside a clean chamber to provide a well-ventilated
environment. To ensure enough light for growth, a sunlight simulator was used, providing 8
hours of light daily to promote growth. 1 mL of ultrapure water was added to each vial every
other day to ensure sufficient watering for an entire 30-day growth period. To assess the
influence of NPs on garlic plant growth, the mass of each garlic plant on day 1 and day 30 was
recorded for comparison. The root germination, and shoot germination rates of garlic plants were
recorded as time progressed for 30 days to assess the influence of NPs on garlic plants’
germination.
Another batch of garlic plants was cultivated under different conditions: Instead of adding PS NP
suspension only once on day 1, we added their proper concentrations of 2 ml PS NP suspensions
into their respective vials on day 1, and 1 mL PS NP suspensions on day 2, 4, and 6 (a total of
four times). Additionally, 1 mL of ultrapure water was added every other day starting from day 8
until day 30. The varied exposure conditions aimed to replicate real-world irrigation scenarios,
allowing for comparison with the single exposure group to assess potential differences.

2.4 Qualitative Confocal Raman Microscopy Imaging
We used an Alpha 300R Raman spectroscope from WITec for imaging. The confocal
microscope is equipped with a 785 nm laser and offers magnification options of 10x, 50x, and
100x. SERS imaging of model NP in/on garlic samples is performed using an auto-scanning
system, which utilizes motorized X-Y scanning and Z-focusing functions. The Raman mappings
and spectra of model NPs are processed using the software Project Five+. We are able to observe
the presence and distribution of NPs in garlic samples by using this technique. The scanning
settings such as laser power, scanning step size, and integration time are adjusted prior to testing
to ensure that the energy generated by the gold core does not damage the garlic sample tissue.

2.5 Quantitative detection of NPs with ICP-MS
To precisely assess the concentration of NPs in different segments of garlic plants (roots, and
upper part), we used ICP-MS for accurate quantitative detection, enabling us to investigate the
uptake and distribution of NPs within the garlic plants. Due to the composition of model PS NPs,
it requires two acid digestion steps before starting the ICP-MS analysis. To break down the PS
layer of the model PS NPs and garlic tissue, we used the Anton Paar Multiwave PRO acid
digester with serial number 82459284, operating on instrument software version 3.20.10645.6.
The digestion process was carried out separately for the root, and upper part segments. Each
segment was placed into the digestion vessel along with an acid mixture consisting of 8 ml
HNO3 and 1 ml H2SO4, and then subjected to digestion for 7 hours at 180°C. After undergoing
acid digestion in the acid digester, the sample volume was approximately 1 mL. Following this,
to digest the gold core of the model PS NPs for ICP-MS analysis, it was further digested with 1
mL of aqua regia at room temperature for 2 hours. In preparation for ICP-MS analysis, 0.5 mL of
the digested sample was diluted with 4.5 mL of ultrapure water to achieve an acid concentration

of 5%. Prior to analysis by ICP-MS, the samples underwent filtration using Biomed Scientific's
Syringe Filters Nylon with a 25mm diameter and a pore size of 0.45 micrometers. This analytical
technique is highly sensitive, allowing for precise determination of gold content with detection
limits ranging from parts per trillion (ppt) to parts per billion (ppb). It provides valuable insights
into the concentration and distribution of gold within each segment of the garlic plants.

3. Results and discussion
We developed a dual-functional model PS NP that enables qualitative visualization using SERS
imaging and quantitative assessment of PS NP concentrations through ICP-MS. Utilizing this dualfunctional model NP enables in situ imaging of biological samples without damaging. Due to the
presence of gold in the model NPs, ICP-MS quantification is also feasible when the SERS
detection limit is reached. To evaluate the application of the model NPs, we used garlic plants as
a matrix to test the model NPs. Specifically, we exposed the garlic plants to the model NPs for a
period of time and utilized the SERS and ICP-MS analysis model to study the uptake and
distribution of NPs in different parts of the garlic plants over time. The model PS NPs were
characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS, Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments),
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM 2100F), and Ultraviolet-Visible
spectroscopy (UV-Vis, HP/Agilent 8453).

3.1 Model PS NPs stability characterization
TEM results confirmed the core-shell structure of the model NP featuring a gold crore at the
center and a PS shell surrounding it. The diameter was measured to be 61.0 ± 0.66 nm,
comprising a 33.6 ± 0.65 nm gold core and a 13.7 ± 0.18 nm PS layer. Raman results
demonstrated that the gold core significantly enhances the Raman reporter signal. A redshift of
the maximum absorption peak in the UV-Vis spectra indicated that the PS coating was

successfully applied to the gold core. Figure 1a illustrates the structure of the model PS NPs,
which feature a core-shell structure. There is a gold core at the center, which is tagged with 4MBA as the SERS nanotags. Surrounding the core is a PS shell to simulate the PS surface
properties. The presence of gold significantly amplifies the SERS nanotags signals, enhancing
Raman signals exponentially and making it more accurate and easier to detect.
Furthermore, we assessed the stability of the model NPs by comparing TEM characterization
images of the freshly prepared model NPs (Fig. 1c) and 12 months later after synthesis (Fig. 1d).

remained in the cuvette for the entire 24-hour duration. The results demonstrated that the model
NPs suspension was very stable with an absorbance of 0.39 ± 0.016 (Fig. 1b).

3.2 SERS limit of detection
A Raman spectroscope equipped with a confocal microscope was used in this study to obtain
2D/3D imaging of model NPs in garlic plants. The scanning speed is fast, with a low integration
time of 0.001s/spectrum/pixel, and it provides high spatial resolution, reaching as small as 300
nm. The novel NP model enables multi-dimensional imaging through SERS and SERS has
several unique advantages for NP imaging in biological samples, such as in-situ detection
without causing damage to the living organism’s matrix. This allows for the long-term study of
biological samples to observe the uptake and distribution patterns of model NPs. Detecting
model NPs with dye-free surfaces eliminates the need for fluorescent dye, thus avoiding any
drawbacks associated with dyes. The model NP incorporates a nAu core that is labeled with a
Raman indicator. The cores enhance Raman indicator signals, enabling the direct detection of
model NPs through SERS. In contrast to traditional Raman spectroscopy, SERS has higher
sensitivity by incorporating nAu cores, leading to a substantial increase in Raman signals by
several orders of magnitude (105 - 1010)31

To evaluate the detection limit of SERS for this model PS, a single particle detection by SERS
was conducted to determine its feasibility. We first diluted the model PS suspension and used an
indexed TEM grid to locate a single PS particle with TEM (Fig. 2a-b). Afterward, we subjected
this single particle to
Raman detection.
However, due to the
extremely small amount of
model PS, the signal was
not significantly enhanced.
A very weak Raman
intensity of 5.3 was
detected using high laser
power (Fig. 2c). The

sensitivity of SERS method
and helped achieve reliable

3.3 SERS imaging and ICP-MS quantification of model NPs in garlic roots
3.3.1 SERS imaging of various PS NP concentrations uptake in garlic roots
We aimed to explore the possibility of SERS imaging for detecting the model PS NPs in a garlic
plant matrix. To achieve this, we investigated the uptake of various concentrations of PS NP
suspensions in garlic plants using SERS imaging. By conducting a depth line scan on garlic
plants with the confocal Raman microscope, we simulated a transection of the garlic plants,
facilitating visualization of their cross-sectional morphology. Detection of PS NPs within the
scanned region enables the characterization of their uptake via imaging techniques. We chose to
scan the root tip region as shown in Fig. 3a, 3b, as it experienced prolonged exposure to the PS
NP suspensions since the beginning of the experiment. To assess the impact of varying
concentrations of PS NP suspensions on PS NP uptake by garlic roots, we established three
different concentration groups along with a control group (without PS NP exposure) to observe
any variations. The confocal Raman depth line scan was performed on day 30, marking the end

There are five replicates in
each concentration group and
the average Raman spectra of
each group are shown in

of the Raman spectra, it was
noticeable that as the
concentrations of PS NPs
increased, there was a

tip regions as well. The
Raman mappings at the

Panel c presents Raman intensity spectra of PS NPs obtained from garlic roots on
day 30, demonstrating variations corresponding to different concentrations of PS
NP suspension exposure. Their Raman maps at the characteristic peak of model
NPs (1078 cm-1) are shown in panels d-g, representing PS NP concentrations of 0

characteristic peak of PS NPs (1078 cm-1) are shown in panels d-g of Fig. 3. These mappings
correspond to PS NP concentrations of 0 particles/mL, 2×109 particles/mL, 2×1010 particles/mL,
and 2×1011 particles/mL respectively. By comparing these maps, we can observe the morphology
of the cross-sectional area of the garlic root where signals of PS NPs are present. As we move
from the control group towards lower concentrations of PS NP suspensions and then to higher
concentrations, there is a notable increase in the pixels exhibiting signals. This further validates
and aligns with the Raman spectra, as exposing garlic roots to higher concentrations of PS NP
suspensions results in increased uptake of PS NPs.

3.3.2 SERS imaging of PS NP uptake over time in garlic roots
We tried to investigate whether prolonged exposure of garlic roots to PS NP suspensions results
in increased uptake with SERS imaging. To ensure consistency, we chose to continue focusing
on the garlic root tip region for this portion of the study. The garlic samples were from the
concentration group of 2×1011 particles/mL, as the highest concentration group offers clearer and
more pronounced imaging, allowing for better visualization of the differences in Raman imaging.
We chose to conduct scans on garlic roots on three separate days: day 7, day 14, and day 30. To
maintain reliability, we conducted three replicates each day, as there were only three garlic
samples with roots available on
day 7. This approach was
essential to ensure timely
scanning before the uptake
occurred for too long. By looking
at the Raman maps obtained from
three different days, it is evident
that the PS NPs were present since
day 7 and persisted until day 30 in
garlic roots (Fig. 4c-e). Upon
comparing their Raman spectra and
intensities, a clear trend emerges,
indicating that with longer exposure
to PS NPs, the average intensities
significantly increased (Fig. 4a-b).

Fig. 4. Panel a presents the average Raman intensity spectra of PS
NPs obtained from garlic roots on days, 14, and 30, demonstrating
variations corresponding to different exposure times to PS NP
suspensions. The specific Raman intensities are shown in panel b.
Their Raman maps generated at the characteristic peak of model
NPs (1078 cm-1) are shown in panels c-e with a color scale bar,
representing exposure time of day 7, day 14, and day 30
respectively.

This demonstrated that prolonged exposure to PS NPs allowed garlic roots to uptake a great
quantity of PS NPs.
3.3.3 SERS imaging of PS NP uptake at different locations of garlic roots
Even though we have demonstrated that garlic roots possess the ability to uptake PS NPs into
their roots in the previous study, we are still interested in investigating whether different
locations on the root exhibit varying uptake capabilities. To accomplish this study, SERS
imaging was conducted to visualize the distribution of PS NPs in roots. The garlic samples used
were from the group with a concentration of 2×1011 particles/mL PS NP suspension. SERS scans
were performed for all five replicates on the 30th day of garlic cultivation. The confocal Raman
depth scans followed
the same procedure,
with the only variation
being the direction of
the line drawn for
scanning. Instead of
conducting the vertical
scans as shown in Fig.
5b, we performed a
horizontal scan as
illustrated in Fig. 5b.
This allowed for a
larger area to be
scanned, facilitating a

more extensive view of the root when imaging the distribution of PS NPs. Three locations were
examined as shown in Fig. 5a, including the tip (A), the middle (B), and the top (C) parts. It
appears that the uptake across the three locations is relatively consistent based on the average
Raman intensity (Fig. 5c-d). The average intensity consistently displayed a uniform intensity
level. Based on the results of the Raman maps, indications of PS NP presence were observed in
all three locations with significant Raman intensities (Fig. 5e-g). In conclusion, all the findings
suggest that different locations on the same root exhibit similar PS NP uptake abilities on day 30,
however, the outcomes with shortened exposure durations are unknown.
3.3.4 ICP-MS quantification of the PS NP uptake within garlic plants
We aimed to assess whether
the model NPs could be
detected using ICP-MS by
measuring their
concentration in garlic plants
with this technique. To
quantitatively assess the
distribution of PS NPs in
different garlic parts, we
used ICP-MS to quantify the
uptake of PS NPs by the
garlic plants. Figure 5a
shows the procedure of
ICP-MS samples

Fig. 6. Panel a illustrates the steps involved in preparing garlic plant samples for ICPMS analysis, which includes acid digestion followed by sample filtration to ensure purity.
Panel b displays the average number of NP particles detected in the roots of garlic
plants across three different NP exposure concentration groups. Panel c illustrates the
average number of NP particles detected in the upper parts of garlic plants for the same
three concentrations groups, as well as a control group.

preparation. We first divided the garlic plants into two segments: the roots that were in constant
contact with the PS NP suspension, and the upper part that was not in contact with the PS NPs in
the vial. For the digestion of the PS shell and garlic tissue, a high-temperature and high-pressure
acid digester was used in conjunction with an acid mixture. Additionally, aqua regia was used to
digest the gold core at the center, and the process was performed at room temperature. Finally, a
filtration step was carried out to remove impurities from the digested samples. By analyzing the
numbers of PS NPs in these two segments, we can determine whether NPs transported from the
roots to the upper part. The ICP-MS analysis results provide the gold concentration in parts per
billion (ppb), represented as µg/L. Since the mass of each gold core in the PS NP is known, we
could subsequently calculate the number of PS NPs in the analyzed garlic plants. By examining
the final particle number results, we can observe a trend wherein garlic plants grown in varying
concentrations of PS NP suspension exhibit a correlation: higher concentrations of PS NP
suspension correspond to a great number of PS particles detected in the roots (Fig. 6b). ANOVA
test was conducted for four groups, yielding a p-value of 0.042, indicating statistically significant
differences among groups. For the 2×109 particles/mL and 2×1010 particles/mL PS NPs groups,
the average particle numbers are slightly elevated compared to the control group. This can be
attributed to the low concentration of PS NP suspensions. However, for the 2×1011 particles/mL
group, there is a significant increase in particle numbers detected in roots, indicating that higher
concentrations of PS NP suspensions lead to greater uptake of PS NPs by garlic roots.
To further investigate the uptake of PS NPs in garlic plants, the upper part of garlic which has
never directly come into contact with PS NPs was analyzed using ICP-MS. Considering that the
average height of the upper parts of garlic plants is 8.5 cm, and each line scan only covers less
than 1000 µm, it lacks comprehensiveness to encompass the entirety of the upper parts, making

the PS NPs challenging to detect by SERS. However, the results for the control group, as well as
for groups of 2×109 particles/mL, 2×1010 particles/mL, and 2×1011 particles/mL, exhibit similar
results, indicating the absence of PS NPs within the upper part of garlic plants in these groups
(Fig. 6c). One possible reason is that the number of PS NPs in the upper part of the garlic plant is
too low, falling below the detection limit and therefore not detectable.
In summary, utilizing ICP-MS enabled us to accurately quantify PS NPs in the garlic roots,
complementing the SERS imaging technique. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to higher
concentrations of PS NP suspensions results in increased uptake by garlic plants in roots.

4. Conclusion
This study aimed to develop a dual-functional model NP and test its application in biological
samples by investigating the uptake and distribution of model PS Ns in garlic plants. The
development of this model material allows for a dual-functional analysis with the model PS NPs.
This enables us to use both SERS imaging and ICP-MS quantification techniques to detect model
NPs in garlic plants. The model PS NPs also address the challenge of collecting NPs from the
environment without impurities.
Utilizing SERS imaging, we discovered that prolonged exposure to PS NPs resulted in increased
uptake by garlic roots. Uptake was observed to start on day 7 and continued to escalate until the
end of the 30-day study period. Other findings on day 30 also revealed that higher concentrations
of PS NPs corresponded to increased uptake by roots. However, we also observed that three
different locations on the root exhibited a similar number of uptake PS NPs on the 30th day. This
finding is limited due to the extended exposure period. Results may have varied if tested earlier,
and examining multiple concentration groups could yield different outcomes. Through ICP-MS
quantification, we successfully detected the presence of model NPs in garlic plants roots. This

confirms the possibility of using ICP-MS to detect model NPs in living organism. With this
model of PS NPs, we were also able to explore their effects on the growth of garlic plants. Based
on the observations and results obtained from the 30-day cultivation of garlic plants, we found
that exposing the PS NPs only once at the beginning did not result in any discernible negative or
positive effects on garlic plant growth/germination during the cultivation period. All garlic plants
across groups successfully germinated roots and shoots within 30 days, with no discernible
difference in germination rates observed. However, if the exposure to PS NPs continued during
the growth period, similar to what occurs in environmental scenarios such as NP-contaminated
irrigation water continuously contacting the plants, a significantly lower germination rate was
observed. Under the same growing conditions and watering intervals, the groups contaminated
with PS NPs exhibited a maximum of 40% germinated rate (Fig. S1-2).
In future studies, continuous exposure to model NPs throughout the growth period may be
considered to better replicate environmental scenarios, thus, the uptake by garlic plants might
potentially be more obvious and easily detectable with both SERS and ICP-MS.
With the development of the dual-functional model material, we can replicate the behavior of
NPs and their interactions with garlic plants, mirroring real-world conditions. By combining
SERS imaging and ICP-MS, we successfully visualize and quantify the presence of PS NPs
within garlic plants, enhancing the efficiency of our investigation. This research highlights the
potential of using a combination of SERS and ICP-MS as a powerful analysis model for
detecting dual-functional model PS NPs in agricultural samples. This could have significant
implications for food safety and public health.
