Abstract

26

Most known per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) bioaccumulate by binding to proteins or

27

partitioning to phospholipids, leading to their prevalence in liver and blood. As a result, efforts to

28

improve PFAS exposure estimates by identifying novel bioaccumulative substances, have focused on

29

these tissues. However, the recent discovery of high concentrations of unidentified extractable

30

organofluorine (EOF) in the blubber of a killer whale (Orcinus orca) from Greenland suggests that some

31

fluorinated substances bioaccumulate preferentially in storage lipids. The present work builds on this

32

initial finding by characterizing EOF in an additional 3 killer whales (2 from Greenland, 1 from

33

Sweden), and then subjecting extracts from all 4 whales to analysis via gas chromatography-atmospheric

34

pressure chemical ionization-ion mobility mass spectrometry. Using collision cross sections, we

35

prioritized features suspected to be highly fluorinated, and then selected 5 for manual annotation.

36

Custom synthesised standards confirmed 10:2 and 12:2 fluorotelomer methylsulfone, 10:2 and 12:2

37

fluorotelomer chloromethylsulfone, and 6:2 bisfluorotelomer sulfone in all blubber samples from

38

Greenland at concentrations ranging from <0.4-72.5 ng/g, explaining 34-75% of blubber EOF. None of

39

these substances were observable in liver, suggesting preferential accumulation in storage lipids. To the

40

best of our knowledge, this is the first report of fluorotelomer sulfones in wildlife and the first

41

observation of lipophilic, highly fluorinated PFAS.

Synopsis

50

Five novel fluorotelomer sulfones were identified in killer whales from Greenland, explaining up to 75%

51

of extractable organofluorine in blubber. Their absence in liver points to their lipophilic nature, marking

52

the first report of such compounds in wildlife.

Introduction

55

Chemicals containing fully fluorinated methyl (-CF3) or methylene (-CF2-) groups are classified as per-

56

and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).1 These compounds, primarily of anthropogenic origin, find

57

widespread use in both industrial and consumer applications.2 To date, over 10 000 PFAS are known to

58

exist on the global market, spanning both low-molecular weight water soluble substances, to high

59

molecular weight, hydrophobic polymers.1

60

Most research on PFAS has focused on perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and their precursors. Among the

61

most notorious PFAAs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), highly

62

water-soluble surfactants that possess very low pKas and tend to accumulate in protein- and

63

phospholipid-rich tissues (such as liver and blood) rather than storage lipids (adipose tissue) like other

64

persistent organic pollutants.3–5 While PFAA-precursors and alternatives (e.g. perfluorooctane

65

sulfonamide and perfluorinated ether acids, respectively) have a greater propensity for fat partitioning

66

compared to PFAAs, their concentrations in storage lipids are usually much lower than those in liver or

67

blood.4,6,7 For other PFAS, particularly neutral substances, tissue-specific accumulation remains either

68

unexplored or is assumed to follow behaviour similar to PFAAs. However, the impact of fluorination

69

on lipophilicity is not always predictable. For instance, fluorination of an aromatic ring with either a

70

single fluorine atom or a perfluoroalkyl group has been observed to increase lipophilicity compared to

71

hydrogen at the same position, while fluorination of alkyl groups can lead to an increase or decrease in

72

lipophilicity.8,9

73

Recently, our research group provided the first empirical evidence of large quantities of unidentified

74

extractable organic fluorine (EOF) in the blubber of a marine mammal.7 In that work, a combination of

75

combustion ion chromatography (CIC) and mass spectrometry-based target analyses were applied to

76

eight different tissues of a killer whale (Orcinus orca) from East Greenland. While the distribution of

77

known PFAS in tissues aligned with previous findings (with decreasing concentrations in the order: liver

78

> blood > kidney ≈ lung ≈ ovary > muscle ≈ skin ≈ blubber), unknown EOF concentrations determined

79

via CIC were highest in blubber. These results could not be explained by inorganic fluorine (which was

80

removed during the extraction procedure) or targeted PFAS. Considering that blubber can account for

81

up to 50% of the entire body mass of some species of cetaceans at certain life stages,10,11 we posit that

82

overlooking chemicals in this compartment may significantly underestimate overall exposure to

83

organofluorine substances.12

84

Efforts to characterize unidentified EOF have generally relied on suspect and non-target screening using

85

liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with electrospray ionization

86

(ESI).13–16 This approach favours polar, charged, or easily ionizable compounds, and is generally

87

unsuitable for non-polar/neutral substances, which do not ionize efficiently in ESI. To address this, a

88

number of new methods have been developed based on gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure

89

chemical ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-HRMS), which have proven

90

effective at uncovering novel non-polar PFAS in a wide range of matrices.17–20 APCI is a softer

91

ionization process compared to the traditionally used electron ionization (EI) in GC analyses, resulting

92

in the detection of (quasi-)molecular ions. Additionally, when coupled with ion mobility spectrometry

93

(IMS), collision cross sections (CCSs) can be used as an additional prioritization strategy for fluorinated

94

substances.17

95

In this work we build on the initial discovery of unidentified EOF in the blubber of a Greenland killer

96

whale by characterizing EOF in the blubber of 3 additional individuals, and then identifying the nature

97

of this EOF using GC-APCI-IMS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify

98

lipophilic PFAS in wildlife.

Materials and Methods

101

Sample Collection

102

Blubber from three killer whales referred to herein as KW-16, KW-17 (previously characterized by

103

Schultes et al. 2020),7 and KW-20 were collected together with local subsistence Inuit hunters in 2016,

104

2017 and 2020, respectively, in Greenland. Liver was also obtained from KW-17. Blubber from a fourth

105

killer whale (KW-23) which was found dead at Hunnebostrand, Sweden, in 2023, was also sampled.

106

Further information on these samples, including CITES (Convention on International Trade in

107

Endangered Species) permit numbers, can be found in Table S 1.

108
109

Sample preparation

110

Extraction. Subsamples (2 g) of blubber (n=3 for KW-17; n=1 for all others) and liver (KW-17 only;

111

n=2) were thawed at room temperature and then extracted with 4 mL of acetonitrile together with bead

112

blending (10 minutes, 1500 rpm, SPEX SamplePrep 1600 MiniG®). Subsequently, the samples were

113

centrifuged (Centrifuge 5810, Eppendorf), and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube.

114

The extraction process was repeated, and the supernatants were combined and concentrated down to 1

115

mL using a TurboVap LV Evaporator (Biotage). A portion of extract was removed for EOF

116

determination.

117

Lipid removal. In preparation for characterization by GC-APCI-IMS, extracts were subjected to a lipid

118

removal procedure, described elsewhere and adapted here.21 Briefly, extracts were placed in a freezer (-

119

24 ⁰C) for 30 minutes to precipitate lipids. Thereafter the supernatants were filtered using a nylon syringe

120

filter and the filtrates were placed in a new tube. The procedure was repeated on precipitated lipids once

121

more using 2 mL of acetonitrile, and the filtrates were combined.

122

Ion exchange clean-up. We hypothesised that lipophilic organofluorines would be neutral, and therefore

123

sought to reduce the complexity of extracts by removing substances with ionizable functional groups.

124

This was achieved using a series of clean-up steps based on ion exchange SPE. Strong cation exchange

125

cartridges (Oasis® MCX, 150 mg) were primed with 8 mL acetonitrile, extracts (~3 mL) were loaded

126

and the cartridges were rinsed with an additional 8 mL of acetonitrile. The combined load and rinse were

127

collected into a single polyethylene tube and reduced to ~3 mL by drying. This procedure was then

128

repeated with strong anion exchange cartridges (Oasis® MAX, 150 mg). The final extracts were dried

129

to ~0.1 mL and transferred to microvials for GC-APCI-IMS analysis.

130

Quality control. Method blanks for both EOF and GC-APCI-IMS analyses were determined by carrying

131

out the same extraction procedure in empty tubes. In addition, portions of extract from KW-17 were

132

retained after lipid removal and again after ion exchange clean-up. Analysis of these extracts by CIC

133

revealed that EOF concentrations remained stable with each successive step, indicating that the major

134

fluorinated substances in blubber were not inadvertently removed during clean-up. Instrumental QC

135

procedures are described in the instrumental analysis section.

136
137

Instrumental analysis

138

Extractable Organofluorine analysis

139

For EOF determination by CIC, extracts (100 μl) were loaded into prebaked ceramic sample boats

140

containing glass wool. The samples were combusted at 1100 °C with oxygen (400 mL/min), argon (200

141

mL/min), and an argon/water vapor mix (100 mL/min) within the combustion unit (HF-210, Mitsubishi)

142

for five minutes. During the combustion process, combustion gases were absorbed in Milli-Q water

143

using a gas absorber unit (GA-210, Mitsubishi), they were subsequently separated and analysed using

144

an ion-chromatograph (Dionex, Thermo Scientific). Quantification was accomplished using calibration

145

points at 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 ppm of NaF solution, employing an unweighted linear

146

calibration curve. Analysis of a certified reference material (fluorine in clay, 568 ± 60 μg F/g, n=3) and

147

a solution of PFOS and PFOA (0.74 ng F/μl) were used to check for combustion efficiency throughout

148

the run, resulting in recoveries of 90%±9% and 105%±2%, respectively. Mean fluoride concentrations

149

from procedural blanks was subtracted from samples before quantification. The limit of quantification

150

(LOQ; 33 ng F/g) was calculated using the average F concentration from procedural blanks plus 3 times

151

the standard deviation of replicate blank measurements, and the average extract volume and sample

152

weight.

GC-APCI-IMS

155

Putative identification of fluorinated substances in KW-17 blubber extracts was carried out at Memorial

156

University (Newfoundland, Canada), using an existing GC-APCI-IMS method for non-target discovery

157

of halogenated substances. 17 These results were later replicated and built upon at Stockholm University

158

using a recently developed GC-APCI-IMS method with few modifications.20 Briefly, extracts (1 μL)

159

were injected onto an Agilent GC using pulse splitless mode with a programmed inlet temperature (i.e.,

160

initially 100 °C for 0.15 min, increased at 600 °C min-1 to 280 °C, hold for 1 min). Analytes were

161

separated on a 30-m DB-5MS Ultra Inert column (i.d., 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 µm; Agilent

162

Technologies) with helium carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.5 mL min-1. The GC oven temperature

163

program was as follows: hold at 70 °C for 1 min; increase at 10 °C min-1 to 310 °C, then hold for 15 min

164

(total run time=40 min). The GC was coupled via an APCI source to a Waters Select Series Cyclic IMS

165

operated in positive ionization mode and under wet conditions (an open vial containing water was placed

166

in the source and left to equilibrate overnight). The transfer line and ion source were maintained at 290

167

°C and 150 °C, respectively. The corona discharge needle and cone voltage were set at 2 μA and 30 V,

168

respectively. Nitrogen was used for the makeup-, auxiliary-, and cone gas at flow rates of 200 mL min-

definition MSE mode with the mass range of 100-1200 amu. The collision energy was fixed at 6 eV at

171

the low energy mode, and ramped between 15-50 eV at the high energy mode. The scan time was 0.3 s

172

for each mode. The cyclic ion mobility cell was operated in the one pass mode with 5 pushes per bin at

173

a traveling wave height of 15 V. Both drift gas and collision gas were nitrogen. Column bleeding

174

(C9H27O5Si5+: m/z 355.0705) was measured every 2 min for internally mass calibration. CCS was

175

calibrated using a mixture of 22 compounds supplied by Waters Corp. according to its standard

procedure.

Data Analysis

179

Lockmass correction, peak picking (minimum absolute ion intensity 40), run alignment, calculation of

180

CCS measurements, and pairing of precursor and product ions (minimum 1% of parent ion) were carried

181

out using Progenesis QI (version 3, Waters corporation). Peaks with areas at least 3 times higher than

182

the area in the procedural blanks were kept for screening. Features were selected for further investigation

183

if their CCS values were between 150 and 250 Å2 and were lower than one fifth of their m/z + 100 Å2,

184

an approach previously demonstrated to be effective for prioritizing fluorinated substances.17 The

185

resulting features were further prioritized based on a) exact masses >400 Da (which we posited could

186

serve as a threshold for bioaccumulative PFAS, given that long chain PFAAs have masses exceeding

187

400 Da), and b) mass defects between -0.1 and +0.05 (characteristic of highly fluorinated substances).22

188

Finally, we prioritized the most intense features for manual inspection and annotation. Custom

synthesised standards for putatively identified compounds were purchased from Chiron AS (Trondheim,

190

Norway) and used for confirmation and quantification.

191
192

Quantification

193

Areas for quantification were obtained via Waters UNIFI™ software. Concentrations and matrix effects

194

for identified PFAS in KW-17 were calculated by standard addition. For the other killer whales, semi-

195

quantification was performed using an external one-point calibration (500 ng/mL mixture of the five

196

fluorotelomer sulfones) and concentrations were adjusted by the matrix effect factor calculated in KW-

197

17. Concentrations of measured PFAS (in ng/g) were converted to corresponding fluorine equivalent

198

concentrations (i.e. ng F/g) and summed in order to compare with EOF measurements (details in the SI).

199

LOQs were based on the analysis of the 500 ng/mL mixture: the equivalent concentration in ng/mL of

200

a peak with height of 500 was calculated for each fluorotelomer sulfone and adjusted by their respective

201

matrix effect factor. LOQs in samples (ng/g) were calculated using the average extract volume and

202

average sample weight and are reported in Table S 2.

204

Results and discussion

205

EOF determination

206

EOF was measured in blubber of KW-16 (69 ng F/g, n=1), KW-17 (162±94 ng F/g, n=6) and KW-20

207

(82 ng F/g, n=1), while it was below limit of quantification for KW-23 (Figure 1, panel A). The EOF

208

concentration in KW-17 reported here represents the triplicate measurement in this study combined with

209

previous measurements by Schultes et al. (2020).7 Measurement of EOF after clean-up (EnviCarb) in

210

Schultes et al. and before any clean-up steps in the present work may explain the slight discrepancy in

211

EOF concentrations between the two studies. The low level in KW-23 could be associated with its

212

geographical location (Sweden), a different diet compared to the other killer whales, or the state of the

213

animal, whose blubber appeared less dense in fats and had a higher relative proportion of connective

214

tissue, suggesting that it may have died of starvation.

HRMS characterization

217

A total of 32343 features (>3× the abundance in method blanks) were observed in the KW-17 extract

218

prior to any prioritization steps. Application of the CCS prioritization reduced the total number of

219

features to 4748, which was further reduced to 478 features by selecting masses >400 Da which also

220

displayed a mass defect between -0.1 and +0.05. Features were then ordered by intensity, and 5 were

221

selected for structural elucidation (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Plot of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) versus collision cross section (CCS) of peaks detected in
KW-17. Peaks with a CCS value under the threshold (100Å2 + 0.2 × m/z; denoted by the dashed line)
were prioritized as potential halogenated compounds. Further prioritization as possible fluorinated
substances (in blue) utilized criteria of m/z> 400, and mass defect between -0.1 and +0.05. Identified
features (the five fluorotelomer sulfones) are in orange.

222

The two most abundant peaks (m/z 627 and 727), were putatively identified as protonated ions of 10:2

223

fluorotelomer methylsulfone (10:2 FTSO2Me; [C13H8F21SO2]+) and 12:2 fluorotelomer methylsulfone

(12:2 FTSO2Me; [C15H8F25SO2]+). Inspection of the product ion spectra for m/z 627 and 727 (Figure S1)

225

revealed loss of HF, producing fragments [C13H7F20SO2]+ and [C15H7F24SO2]+, respectively, and

226

subsequent loss of SO2CH4, forming fragments [C12F20H3]+ and [C14F24H3]+, respectively. From these,

227

subsequent fragmentation follows either loss of C2H2 and another HF giving fragments [C10F19]+ and

228

[C12F23]+, respectively, or loss of CHF3 resulting in fragments [C10F17CH2]+ and [C12F21CH2]+,

229

respectively. Other smaller fluorinated fragments were also present in the product ion spectrum (Figure

230

S 1).

231

Following putative identification of the methyl sulfones, 10:2 fluorotelomer chloromethylsulfone (10:2

232

FTSO2MeCl) and 12:2 fluorotelomer chloromethylsulfone (12:2 FTSO2MeCl) were tentatively

233

identified at lower intensities. These substances were noticed because 10:2 FTSO2MeCl appeared to

234

partially co-elute with 12:2 FTSO2Me. Fragmentation patterns followed loss of CH3OCl, producing

235

[C12F21H4SO]+ and [C14F25H4SO]+, or loss of the sulfone chloromethyl head and HF, giving major

236

fragments [C12F20H3]+ and [C14F24H3]+, respectively. From these, additional fragmentation follows the

237

same pattern as for FTSO2Me (Figures S2 and S3).

238

The third most abundant peak after prioritisation was m/z 759, which was putatively identified as 6:2

239

bisfluorotelomer sulfone (bis(6:2 FT)SO2). Fragments observed in the product ion spectrum (Figure S4)

240

are due to loss of HF [C16F25H8SO2]+ , loss of one of the fluorotelomer sulfone chains [C8F13H6SO2]+,

241

and a subsequent loss of HF, giving fragment [C8F12H5SO2]+ which is itself followed by loss of S(OH)2

242

resulting in [C8F12H3]+.

243

Increasing retention times and CCS values for the two sets of homologues, as well as observation of all

244

five compounds in a similar region of the chromatogram increased confidence in the structural

245

assignment and custom-made analytical standards were purchased from Chiron for confirmation and

246

quantification. Details on the fluorotelomer sulfones structure, m/z, retention times and CCS values can

247

be found in Table 1.

248
249

Confirmation, quantification and organofluorine mass balance

250

Analysis of custom synthesised standards confirmed the identities of the five fluorotelomer sulfones in

251

KW-17 at a sum concentration (∑CFTS) of 83.9 ng/g, made up of 23.6 ng/g 10:2 FTSO2Me, 55.2 ng/g

252

12:2 FTSO2Me, 1.1 ng/g 10:2 FTSO2MeCl, 0.4 ng/g 12:2 FTSO2MeCl and 3.6 ng/g bis(6:2 FT)SO2.

253

These targets were not observable in liver from the same animal. Subsequent analysis in the additional

254

killer whales revealed similar sum concentrations to KW-17 for both KW-16 (60.3 ng/g) and KW-20

255

(94.0 ng/g), with 12:2 FTSO2Me displaying the highest concentrations, followed by 10:2 FTSO2Me,

256

bis(6:2 FT)SO2 and 10:2 FTSO2MeCl. For 10:2 FTSO2MeCl, peaks were detectable but areas were

257

below LOQ. KW-23 was the only animal where these targets were not observed. Detailed concentrations

258

can be found in Table S 2.

Conversion of ∑CFTS to fluorine equivalents (∑CF_FTS) revealed concentrations of 39.2, 54.4, and 61.2

260

ng F/g, for KW16, 17, and 20, accounting for 57%, 34%, and 75% of the EOF in these animals,

261

respectively. Schultes et al.7 previously measured a suite of polar PFAS by LC-HRMS in KW-17 blubber

262

extracts, which accounted for only 6.3 ng F/g (4% of EOF). When combined with fluorotelomer sulfone

263

concentrations, 37% of EOF was explained in KW-17 blubber (Figure 1, panel B), suggesting that

264

additional fluorinated compounds still remain to be identified in blubber. In comparison, if we

265

hypothesise that these compounds are present in the liver at their LOQs, they would correspond to <1%

266

of the EOF, with the balance closed by polar PFAS (Figure 1B).

267

Implications

268

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of highly fluorinated non-polar PFAS in the blubber

269

of marine mammals. Fluorinated liquid crystal monomers (LCMs) have been observed in the blubber of

270

Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins; however, these are structurally different from the substances observed

271

here, possessing a biphenyl backbone structure and fewer fluorine atoms.23 Our group has subsequently

272

observed n:2 FTSO2Me (n=8, 10, 12, 14) in sediment samples from the Baltic sea, the Arctic, a

273

Norwegian lake contaminated with PFAS from a paper production facility, and NIST standard reference

274

material (1941b-Organics in Marine Sediment).20 The 10:2 FTSO2Me and shorter-chain homologues of

275

the same class, 6:2 and 8:2, have been tentatively observed in a waste water treatment plant influent

276

from Spain.18

277

The occurrence of these chemicals in blubber of several killer whales sampled in Greenland indicates

278

that they are subject to long-range transport but exhibit novel bioaccumulative behaviour since they

279

were not observed in liver, thus challenging the paradigm that all PFAS bioaccumulate through

280

interactions with proteins or phospholipids. Notably, since the blubber can constitute up to 50% of body

281

weight in whales, 11 fluorotelomer sulfones might represent a significantly higher body burden for these

282

animals compared to the polar PFAS found in the liver (2-3% of body weight in mammals). 24

283

Given that a considerable portion of EOF remains unexplained and more than 450 features prioritized

284

as possible PFAS remain unidentified, further investigation is necessary. However, this study marks a

285

significant advancement in understanding the composition of EOF in lipid-rich tissues and highlights

286

the importance of including non-polar PFAS in fluorine mass balance studies and in environmental

287

exposure considerations.
