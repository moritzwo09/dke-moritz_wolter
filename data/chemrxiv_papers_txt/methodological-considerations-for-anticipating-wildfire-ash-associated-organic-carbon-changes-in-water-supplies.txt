organic carbon changes in water supplies

Abstract
Wildfire can adversely impact the quality and quantity of water in forested regions by delivering excessive loads of sediment
and burned materials into receiving waters via runoff. To evaluate implications to water treatability, bench- and pilot-scale
investigations often involve wildfire ash addition to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. As methods
are not standardized, a range of experimental conditions, such as different ash/water mixtures and mixing methods have
been used—these can lead to contradictory results. Here, two key factors in source water preparation for investigating
wildfire impacts on water treatability (i.e., mixing time and ash mass concentration) were investigated and their impacts on
leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire ash were characterized. Specifically, a series of controlled
bench-scale experiments were conducted to monitor and evaluate water quality changes in wildfire ash‒impacted water
(WAIW) at different mixing scenarios using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Water quality parameters including
pH, alkalinity, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were measured
in WAIWs. Further characterization of organic matter involved liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD)
analysis. The concentration and character of organic carbon changed considerably during the first 24 hours of mixing. Water
quality and ash mass concentration limit the extraction of organic matter into water. These results emphasize the importance
of (i) specifying experimental conditions and providing rationale for the approach utilized (e.g., demonstrating a worst-case
scenario of maximal leaching of WEOM from wildfire ash, reflecting watershed conditions), (ii) providing a range of results
obtained at different leaching conditions, or alternatively (iii) clarifying that results may be exploratory or comparative, but
not necessarily quantitatively meaningful or relevant for decision-making.

Introduction

Forested watersheds are critical sources of drinking water globally (UNFF, 2016; FAO, 2018). Anthropogenic and natural
landscape disturbances, however, can deteriorate the high quality of water originating in these regions (Janetos et al., 1997;
Christensen et al., 2004; Huntington et al., 2009; Whitehead et al., 2009; Watts et al., 2015). Although natural landscape
disturbances are an integral part of ecosystem regulation, climate change has profoundly impacted the frequency and
severity of such events (IPCC, 2018). Hotter and drier atmospheric conditions associated with climate change have
contributed to the increased frequency of larger, more severe wildfires (USEPA, 2016). Wildfires can alter the timing of
snowmelt and increase stream temperature (Wagner et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2019). They can also change the structure
of soils and lead to decreased infiltration capacity and increased runoff (DeBano, 1991).
Higher rates of runoff can increase the transport and delivery of sediments, nutrients, and other contaminants from hillslopes
to receiving waters (Bladon et al.,2008; Silins et al., 2009; Emelko et al., 2011). Warming temperatures, hydroclimatic
changes, and disturbances such as wildfire also alter the mobility and delivery of organic carbon to water supplies (Emelko
et al., 2024). The change in concentration, character and flux of dissolved and particulate organic carbon in rivers (Rhoades
et al., 2019) can substantially challenge water treatment plant operations (Emelko & Sham, 2014; Hohner et al., 2016;
Shams, 2018) and increase drinking water treatment costs (Emelko et al., 2011; Price et al., 2018). While nature-based

solutions such as biological filtration may offer some resilience to these shifts, their performance may also be compromised
depending on organic carbon character (Blackburn et al., 2023).
Shifts in organic matter concentration and character have been reported following wildfires (Emelko et al., 2011; Hohner et
al., 2016; Uzun et al., 2020, Tshering et al., 2023). The resulting changes in organic matter concentration and character can
strongly affect drinking water treatment needs and performance. Ash collected from both burned landscapes following
wildfires and those produced from simulated wildfires in a laboratory setting (Table 1) has been used in bench scale studies
to evaluate water extractable organic matter (WEOM) concentration and character to inform wildfire impacts on water
quality and treatability, including disinfection by-products (DBP) precursor reactivity.
To evaluate leaching of WEOM from wildfire ash, WEOM concentration and character have been evaluated using a range
of experimental conditions (e.g., different ash-to-water ratios, and mixing conditions) (Table 1). However, the use of nonstandardized methods can often lead to contradictory results. For example, Wang et al. (2016) and Ahmed et al. (2023)
modeled post-fire leaching of carbon during simulated rainfall events in laboratories, using two different approaches. Wang
et al. (2016) attempted to replicate the cumulative impacts of rainfall on carbon leaching by subjecting a sample of pyrogenic
materials to five sequential extractions with ultrapure water. Each time the samples were mixed for 2 hours, and the extracts
were collected for further analysis. Ahmed et al. (2023) used three wet-dry scenarios on custom-made ash soil plots and
passed deionized water through the plots for 15 minutes during each wetting event. Notably, these different leaching
conditions resulted in contrasting trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations after the first simulated postfire rainfall event: Wang et al. (2016) observed a decreasing trend, while Ahmed et al. (2023) reported an increasing trend.
Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential change in organic carbon concentration and character using
different mixing methods and identify practical mixing conditions that result in maximizing the concentration of WEOM
from wildfire ash in water. Accordingly, the objectives of this research were to systematically evaluate (1) temporal changes
of organic matter in wildfire ash-impacted waters (WAIW), and (2) the leaching potential of WEOM from wildfire ash into
water at varying ash-to water ratios. The results provide guidance for preparing and characterizing WAIW to assess its
treatability by identifying key factors affecting the extraction of organic matter from wildfire ash.

Materials and Methods

2.1

Experimental approach

A bench scale study was conducted with controlled conditions to systematically evaluate the impact of (1)
mixing conditions and time and (2) different ash-to-water ratios on the concentration and character of
WEOM leached from wildfire ash. The six ash samples collected from different wildfires and one
prescribed fire reflect a range of fire severities and ash characters. Synthetic WAIW matrices were prepared
using high-quality source water collected from the Elbow River in Calgary, Alberta, Canada as well as
ultrapure water. The use of ultrapure water allows for benchmarking of organic matter leaching from
wildfire ash between sites in absence of water matrix effects while the use of natural source water is more
system specific because it includes matrix effects.
Several studies focusing on the impacts of wildfire and/or lab-produced ash on water quality have used the
terms “extraction” and “leaching” interchangeably to describe the transfer of organic matter from ash to
water. While extraction procedures typically include testing conditions that maximize the extraction of a
targeted element or pollutant from solid phase (e.g., Voegelin et al., 2003; Ran et al., 2007; Guigue et al.,
2014), leaching tests usually intend to simulate the natural dissolution of compounds into water (e.g.,
Voegelin et al., 2003; Guigue et al., 2014). Thus, the release of organic matter from wildfire ash is described
here as extraction, while the dissolution of organic matter into water is referred to as leaching, following
the definitions provided in LEAF Methods 1313, 1315, and 1316 (EPA, 2023).

2.2

Experimental design

The overall design of the two bench scale experiments reported herein is presented in Figure 1 . The impacts
of mixing conditions and time and ash mass concentration on WEOM were evaluated using Elbow River
(Calgary, Alberta, Canada) source water and ultrapure (Milli-Q®, 18.2 MΩ-cm @ 25°C, TOC ≤ 5 ppb)
water. Elbow River water quality is summarized in Table 2. Notably, the temperature of WAIW matrices
was maintained at approximately 21°C throughout the experiments.

Experiment 1 involved two phases investigating the impact of: I) mixing conditions, and II) the duration of
ash and water mixing on WEOM concentration and quality. In phase I, to evaluate the impact of mixing
conditions 2 g of ash from two wildfires were mixed in 1 L of ultrapure water at two conditions: A) mixing
for 5 minutes at 120 RPM followed by 24 h of settling; and B) mixing for 24 h at 120 RPM. Water samples
were collected after 5 minutes of mixing and at the end of the experiment (i.e., after 24 h). The concentration
of total and dissolved organic matter (i.e., TOC and DOC) were measured; dissolved organic matter was
also characterized using specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA).
Based on the results from phase I of the experiment, mixing conditions for phase II were selected to
maximize the concentration of WEOM from wildfire ash. Thus, synthetic WAIW matrices were prepared
by mixing 2 g/L of each of six ash types with ultrapure and source water collected from Elbow River at 120
RPM for 24 h followed by 24 h of gentle mixing at 40 RPM (Figure 1). Subsequent samples were collected
at the beginning of the experiment before ash addition to water (labeled as initial), and after the addition of
ash when the suspension was mixed for 30 min, 6, 10, 24, and 48 hours. DOC, conductivity and pH were
measured on all WAIW; dissolved organic matter was also characterized using SUVA and size exclusion
liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) analyses. In addition, disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) and uniform formation condition (UFC) tests were performed on the
WAIWs collected after 30 min and 24 h of mixing to demonstrate the mixing time impacts on the leaching
of DBP precursors from ash to water. These analyses are further described in section 2.4.
In Experiment 2, the impact of ash mass concentration on WEOM concentration and character was
evaluated. Two batches of synthetic WAIW with ash-to-water ratios of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 g/L were made
by mixing each of the six ash types with ultrapure and source water collected from the Elbow River in
Calgary, Alberta, Canada (Figure 1). WAIW samples were collected after 24 h of mixing at 120 RPM, and
their quality was characterized in the same manner as in the first set of experiments.

Figure 1 This study consisted of two experiments: Experiment 1 investigated the impact of mixing condition
and time, while Experiment 2 examined the effect of ash mass concentration on the concentration and
characteristics of WEOM. In each experiment, both ultrapure and natural untreated river water were used
to prepare WAIW. Six different ash types were analyzed: CC (Cameron Creek ash), DC-S1 (Doctor Creek
ash sampling site 1), DC-S2 (Doctor Creek ash sampling site 2), TC (Thuya Creek ash), SC (Scottie Creek
ash), and DC-P (Doctor Creek ash after a prescribed fire).

2.3

Collection of wildfire ash

Ash samples collected from four wildfires and one prescribed fire reflect a range of pyrogenic materials
produced by different burn severities (Table 3). All ash types were air dried and sieved through a 1 mm
screen to homogenize samples and eliminate any large debris and conifer needles (Cawley et al., 2018;
Harper et al., 2019; Skwaruk et al., 2020). The color of different ash types was identified visually using a
Munsell color chart. Processed samples were stored in closed containers at a controlled temperature of
21°C. Organic matter content of each ash type was measured using loss on ignition according to ASTM
D7348-21 method.

Water quality analyses

Most water quality analyses were conducted according to Standard Methods 24th edition (APHA, 2022).
Water quality parameters investigated included pH (Standard Method 4500H using Fisher Scientific
Accumet AB250 benchtop PH/ISE meter), alkalinity (titration method Standard Method 2320B using 0.1N
HCl), conductivity (Malvern Panalytical Zetasizer Nano Z series with an accuracy of 10%) and maximum
conductivity (200 mS/cm). DOC and TOC were measured using the combustion method (Standard Method
5310C) on a Shimadzu TOC-VCHP Analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, Jiangsu, China) with a detection
limit of 0.1 mg/L. The UV absorbance at 254 nm was measured using a UV254 analyzer (RealTech P200B)
following Standard Method 5910B. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA) was calculated by
dividing UV254 by DOC concentration (Edzwald et al., 1985; Weishaar et al., 2003).
Size exclusion liquid chromatography in combination with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) analysis
was conducted according to Huber et al. (2011) using a Model 8 LC-OCD analyzer (DOC-Labor GmbH,
Karlsruhe, Germany). A size exclusion column, weak cation exchange column on a polymethacrylate basis
(Toyopearl HW 50S, 250 mm x 20 mm, 30 μm from TOSOH Bioscience) was used for separation. The
organic carbon detector was calibrated using potassium hydrogen phthalate. A customized software
program (ChromCALC, DOC-LABOR, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used for data acquisition and processing.
LC-OCD subdivides organic carbon into two general groups of hydrophobic (including all the molecules
that retain on the column) and hydrophilic fractions, which can be further sub-divided into five fractions:
biopolymers, humic substances, building blocks, LMW acids, and LMW neutrals based on molecular size.
Biopolymers are the largest group of hydrophilic compounds with molecular weights higher than 20,000
g/mol (>10 kDa) that don't absorb the 254nm UV radiation, and include polysaccharides, proteins,
polypeptides and amino sugars. Humic substances include humic and fulvic acids with a molecular weight
range from 400 to 1100 g/mol. Building blocks are defined as humic substance-like material of lower
molecular weight (300-500 g/mol). LMW acids consist of small aliphatic organic acids with molecular
weights lower than 350 g/mol). LMW neutrals include weakly charged hydrophilic or slightly hydrophobic
compounds like alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, sugars and amino acids. WAIW samples were filtered
through 0.45 µm polyethersulfone (PES), Millipore Express® PLUS; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, for
DOC, UV254 and LC-OCD analyses.
DBP formation potential (FP) tests under standard conditions (Methods 5710 B and 5710 D (APHA, 2022),
as well as uniform formation conditions (UFC) (Summers, 1996) were performed on the ash-water matrices.
DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)) precursors from the ash-water matrix and
the potential of DBP formation in drinking water distribution systems after chlorination of ash impacted
waters were evaluated. While the uniform formation conditions test predicts DBP formation within drinking

water distribution systems (Summers et al., 1996), the true FP test evaluates the reactivity of DBP
precursors and allows for WEOM comparisons. For both DBP-FP and DBP-UFC tests, chlorine residuals
after chlorination were measured according to colorimetric Method 4500-Cl G (APHA, 20122) using N, Ndiethyl-p-phenylene diamine (DPD). Trihalomethanes (THMs) were analyzed using purge and trap
extraction and gas chromatography with electron capture detection Method 501.1 (USEPA, 1979). Total
trihalomethanes (TTHMs) concentration was calculated as the sum of four THM compounds
(trichloromethane (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), and
tribromomethane (TBM)). Five haloacetic acids including trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), dichloroacetic acid
(DCAA), monochloroacetic acid (MCAA), monobromoacetic acid (MBAA), and dibromoacetic acid
(DBAA)) were measured according to Method 552.3 (USEPA, 2003), a liquid-liquid extraction and gas
chromatography with electron capture detection method. HAA5 was calculated as the sum of the
concentrations of these five compounds.

Results and Discussion

3.1

Mixing effects on WEOM

3.1.1

Changes in WEOM concentration

The total and dissolved concentrations of extracted organic matter at different mixing conditions
(Experiment 1 Phase I) are presented in Figure 2 a to d. TOC and DOC increased following ash addition to
ultrapure water in all WAIWs. DOC concentrations increased more with continuous mixing relative to no
mixing (i.e., stagnant conditions; Figure 2 a&b); this is likely due to enhanced particle interactions and
increased surface area exposure, which facilitate more efficient leaching of WEOM.
DOC concentrations increased throughout the experimental period. In contrast, TOC concentrations
decreased when WEOM was leached at stagnant conditions—TOC decreased by 93% and 22% in CC and
SC WAIW, respectively (Figure 2 c&d). Such differences may be attributable to ash particle size
distribution and particulate organic carbon density variabilities, which affect settling velocities.
Accordingly, these findings underscore the importance of carefully considering how mixing conditions
during bench- and pilot-scale investigations of WAIW either (i) connect to and reflect landscape conditions
and processes relevant to wildfire ash impacts on water quality or (ii) maximize WEOM concentration so
that treatment performance investigations can be conducted efficiently.

DOC concentration of WAIWs in Phase II are shown in Figure 3a. These concentrations ranged from 0.85
± 0.07 mg/L to 14.0 ± 1.02 mg/L. Consistent with the results presented above and reported elsewhere (e.g.,
Rahman et al., 2018), the addition of wildfire ash to both ultrapure and Elbow River water resulted in an
immediate (i.e., within the first 30 minutes of mixing) increase in WEOM concentration, this trend
continued for 24 hours regardless of ash type. The changes in DOC concentration decreased during the
second half (i.e., 24 to 48 h) of the experiment for all WAIWs (Table 4). The observed shifts in extracted
organic carbon concentration after 24 h of mixing may be associated with photo/biodegradation (Bruun et
al., 2008, Wagner et al., 2015); however, identification of a causal relationship was beyond the scope of the
present investigation. Nonetheless, the substantial increase in DOC concentration, especially within the first

24 hours of the experiment, highlights the critical role of mixing time on the concentration of leached
organic matter and consideration of the objective of the WAIW preparation (i.e., reflecting landscape
process vs. creating a WAIW matrix for treatment performance or other evaluation).

mg/L for CC ash in ultrapure and Elbow River water, respectively). Variable DOC release from different
wildfire ash types suggests that multiple factors such as burn severity, antecedent rainfall, and/or presence
of soil mixed with the ash may substantially impact WEOM leaching—while such relationships are
plausible and often suggested (e.g., Rahman et al., 2018; S´anchez-García et al., 2023), they can be
confounded by differences in experimental approach as shown herein.
It is worth noting that a weak correlation between ash color and burn severity has been suggested (Bodi et
al., 2011). Often, lighter colored (e.g., white or light grey) ash is attributed to more complete combustion
Bodi et al.,2014; Rodela et al., 2022) and is thus expected to release less organic matter to water. It is also
then suggested that darker-colored (e.g., black) ash will release more organic matter to water. In contrast,
several studies have reported no appreciable differences in WEOM leached from white and black ash (Wang
et al., 2015a; Tsai et al., 2017; Rodela et al., 2022), and in some cases, WEOM concentrations leached from
white ash were substantially higher than those from black ash (Wang et al., 2016). Notably, in the present
investigation, lighter colored ash types (i.e., SC and DC-P) released the highest concentrations of organic
carbon to the water (Table 4).

Changes in WEOM character: SUVA and LC-OCD

The changes in SUVA for CC and SC WAIW mixed at different conditions are presented in Figure 2 e&f.
SUVA increased regardless of ash type and mixing condition (Figure 2 e&f). This observation was expected
and aligns with previously reported studies (Tsai et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2020; Skwaruk et al., 2020).
Similar to phase I, in phase II an initial increase in SUVA was recorded for all ash types, regardless of the
source water quality (Figure 3b).
Longer ash-water contact time generally resulted in decreased SUVA in SC WAIW (Figure 2f). In contrast,
while SUVA slightly decreased in CC WAIW at stagnant conditions, it increased with continuous mixing
(Figure 2e). Changes in WAIW SUVA during mixing were also different between ash types in phase II
(Figure 3), suggesting the potential for differential leaching dynamics between ash types.
Comparison of WAIWs prepared using ultrapure and Elbow River water shows that changes in SUVA
values were more pronounced in WAIW matrices prepared with ultrapure water. Notably, SUVA was
higher in WAIWs prepared using ultrapure water throughout the study period (Figure 3b). However, this
difference became less noticeable for ash types with higher concentrations of leachable organic matter (i.e.,
SC and DC-P). This could be attributed to the effect of the natural organic matter (NOM) from Elbow River
on SUVA of WAIW. The contribution of NOM from Elbow River water to the overall SUVA of WAIW
was lower in WAIW with high WEOM/NOM ratios (SC and DC-P; Figure 3b).
Differential leaching dynamics associated with the molecular size and character are indicated by the LCOCD analysis (Figure 4a). Here, the concentrations of refractory fractions (including the predominant
fractions of WEOM: humic substances and building blocks) changed at different mixing times in the various
WAIW (Figure 4). Notably while the yield of refractory fractions (i.e., sum of the concentrations of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-gbt98-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0465-4599 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

refractory fractions divided by DOC concentration) generally remained stable during mixing, SUVA
increased, decreased, and then increased further in all cases, reflecting the nonlinearity and complexity of
leaching dynamics and underscoring that results from investigations reliant on prepared WAIWs must be
interpreted cautiously (Figure 4b).

Changes in WEOM extraction: Source water quality impact

In addition to the effects of source water NOM concentration and character on wildfire ash WEOM
leaching, the potential impacts of source water pH, alkalinity, and conductivity on WAIW quality were also
investigated. Figure 5 shows the pH of WAIW prepared using ultrapure and Elbow River. The changes in
pH of the WAIWs prepared using Elbow River water after the addition of ash were negligible, likely due
to the high alkalinity of Elbow River water (Table 2- Figure 5). In contrast, the absence of buffering capacity
in ultrapure water resulted in a substantial increase in pH following ash addition. Additionally, the decrease
in pH in the WAIW matrices prepared using ultrapure water towards the end of the 24 h experiment may
be attributed to the increasing concentration of humic substances, and dissolution of atmospheric CO2 into
the WAIWs (Figure 5).

Table 5 presents conductivities of WAIWs prepared with 2 g/L of ash after 24 hours of mixing.
Conductivities of WAIWs prepared using ultrapure water were consistently lower than those prepared with
Elbow River water, primarily due to the higher initial conductivity in the Elbow River matrix. The net
change in WAIW conductivity was consistently lower in the Elbow River matrix. While the impact of
source water conductivity on organic matter extraction from wildfire ash has not been previously reported,
an inverse relationship between source water conductivity and the dissolution of organic matter from soils

has been previously reported (Kalbitz et al., 2000; Säurich et al., 2017; Tiemeyer et al., 2017).
Consequently, a greater change in DOC concentrations overtime was expected in WAIWs prepared with
ultrapure water, relative to those prepared with Elbow River water (Figure 6).

Changes in disinfection by-product precursors

DBP formation of WAIWs prepared using 2 g/L SC ash mixed in Elbow River water was measured after
30 min and 24 h of mixing. True formation potential (i.e., DBP-FP) and formation at uniform formation
conditions (i.e., DBP-UFC) were evaluated. DBP precursor concentrations increased by approximately
three times (i.e., from 3.99 ± 0.12 mg/L to 10.9 ± 0.40 mg/L; Figure 7) and led to a generally proportional
increase in DBP formation, as would be expected. Notably, WAIWs mixed for 24 h had almost three times
higher concentrations of DBPs compared to those that were mixed for 30 min, irrespective of DBP type
(i.e., THM or HAA) and chlorination conditions (FP or UFC; Figure 7). Shorter reaction times and lower
chlorine doses at UFC condition (Summers et al., 1996; APHA, 2022) resulted in generally lower DBPUFC compared to DBP-FP (Figure 7 7). This aligns with what has been reported previously (Yang et al.,
2005).
Collectively, the results presented herein demonstrate that mixing time can substantially affect DBP
precursor concentration and character and the concentration of DBPs produced during chlorination of
WAIW. Accordingly, it is critical that evaluations of prepared WAIW matrices (as opposed to wildfireimpacted source waters) explicitly outline experimental conditions and justify the selected methodology,
present a range of outcomes across various leaching conditions, or acknowledge that findings may not be

Ash‒water partitioning of WEOM

3.2.1

Changes in WEOM concentration

Figure 8 a&b shows variations in leached WEOM in WAIWs (i.e., DOC concentration) after 24 h of mixing
with ash-to-water ratios ranging from 0.5 to 5 g/L. Notably, the lowest ash mass concentration (i.e., 0.5
g/L) resulted in considerable increase in DOC concentration (e.g., SC and DC-P; Figure 8 a&b). Suggesting
ash characteristics can substantially impact the extraction of organic matter from wildfire ash. This aligns
with previously reported studies (e.g., Rahman et al., 2018; S´anchez-García et al., 2023). Additionally, a
positive correlation between ash-to-water ration and DOC concentration was observed over the ash mass
concentrations investigated (i.e., WEOM saturation was not reached). For the same ash mass concentration,
the highest WEOM concentration was measured in WAIWs prepared using SC and DC-P ash types, while
it was considerably lower in WAIWs prepared with CC and DC-S1 ash, regardless of the water used (i.e.,
ultrapure or Elbow River; Figure 8 a&b). Although this observation did not align with the color-based
classification of ash and its WEOM content, it was consistent with the findings of the previous experiment
(section 3.1).
Ash organic matter content and WEOM concentration for the investigated ash types are presented in Table
6. Organic matter content ranged from 3.7 ± 0.1% to 21 ± 1.9 % for DC-S1 and CC, respectively (Table 6).
Notably, the lowest DOC concentrations were measure in WAIWs prepared using the same ash types. This
suggests that there is no correlation between ash organic matter content and its leachable organic carbon
concentration.
At ash mass concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 g/L, the normalized concentration of extracted organic
matter (expressed as mg of DOC extracted per g of ash) was highly sensitive to ash-to-water ratio. WEOM
yield decreased with an increase in ash mass concentration in all WAIW (Figure 8 c&d). For ash-to-water
ratios exceeding 2 g/L, the normalized WEOM concentration stabilized, showing minimal further change,
however. This behavior might be attributed to changes in ionic strength following the addition of ash to
water (e.g., Brito et al., 2021), which can influence the solubility of organic matter (Lawrence & Roy,
2021). Specifically, this observation can be attributed to dissolution chemistry differences between dilute
and non-dilute systems (Logan, 2012; Klučáková & Věžníková, 2016). In concentrated solutions and
suspensions, ionic strength increases and electrostatic interactions become stronger, leading to deviations
from ideality. The reasons for these deviations at higher ionic strength may include increased (i)
competition between inorganic ions and organic molecules for water molecules that reduce the hydration
shell around organic molecules rendering them less soluble and more likely to aggregate or precipitate (i.e.,
“salting out”), (ii) compression of the electric double layer around negatively charged organic matter

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-gbt98-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0465-4599 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

leading to its destabilization and aggregation thereby preventing or reducing its dissolution, (iii) cation
bridging between negatively charged organic functional groups reducing solubility and promoting the
formation of organic complexes (flocs) that limit dissolution, and (iv) reduced hydrophobic dissolution as
a result of increased solution/suspension polarity at higher ionic strength making it less favorable for nonpolar, hydrophobic organic molecules (e.g., aromatic and lipid-like components of DOC) to dissolve.
Similar trends have been observed in studies examining the leaching of various inorganic elements from
soils and fly ash. These studies consistently reported a decrease in leaching efficiency for multiple metals
as the solids-to-liquid (S/L) ratio increases, highlighting the broader influence of solid concentration on
solute mobility (Koralegedara et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2018; Ghosh & Kartha, 2025). The increase in S/L
ratio reduces the available free water molecules to interact with solute particles, thereby hindering the
solubility of various compounds, ultimately decreasing extraction efficiency.

Changes in WEOM character: SUVA and LC-OCD

Figure 8 e&f presents the changes in SUVA for WAIWs prepared using different ash mass concentrations.
Regardless of the ash type, SUVA values increased WAIW at lower ash-to-water ratios (i.e., 0.5 to 2 g/L).
However at ash mass concentrations greater than 2 g/L SUVA stabilized for almost all ash types, except
for CC (Figure 8 e&f). SUVA values were higher in WAIWs prepared using ultrapure water, for almost all
ash types (except for DC-S1), this could be attributed to the initial SUVA in Elbow River water and its
potential impact on the overall WAIW SUVA.
LC-OCD analysis confirmed changes in WEOM character with increasing ash mass concentration, as
shown in Figure 9a. The data shows that increasing ash-to-water ratio leads to an increase in the
concentration of all organic matter fractions. Consistent with the results of experiment 1 (section 3.1) and
previously reported studies (Skwaruk et al., 2020; Blackburn et al., 2023), the greatest increases in organic
matter fractions were in refractory fractions of DOC (i.e., humic substances and building blocks). However,
there is no apparent proportionality among increases of different fractions at each ash mass concentration
(Figure 9a). In contrast to SUVA, refractory fractions yield generally remained stable in all WAIWs across
different ash-to-water ratios. This discrepancy emphasizes that different methods of analysis may capture
distinct aspects of the organic matter present and highlights the critical need for careful interpretation of
results.

Changes in WEOM extraction: Source water quality impact

The impacts of initial pH and alkalinity of source water on the overall WAIW pH were also assessed. Figure
10 shows changes in pH for all WAIWs prepared using different ash mass concentrations mixed in ultrapure
and Elbow River water. The largest changes in pH were observed in WAIWs prepared using ultrapure

water. In contrast, changes in pH in Elbow River water were negligible, due to its high initial alkalinity
(140-170 mg/L; Table 2).

Conclusions

The effects of mixing conditions, time, and ash mass concentration on water extractable organic matter
(WEOM) release from wildfire ash to water were investigated to demonstrate that experimental approach
affects water quality and treatability assessments when using prepared wildfire ash-impacted water
(WAIW) matrices (i.e., water matrices to which pyrogenic material is added to infer wildfire implications
to water quality or treatability). Key conclusions from this research are:
-

the impacts of wildfire on WEOM characteristics were generally consistent across different ash
types. A higher DOC concentration consisting of mainly humic substances was measured in all
WAIWs, regardless of mixing condition and ash mass concentration in the suspension,

-

WEOM concentrations in ash leachates and ash organic content do not necessarily correlate with
the ash color classification scheme,

-

substantial changes in organic matter concentration and character occur during the first 24 h of
WAIW mixing and can impact inferred implications of wildfire ash on drinking water quality and
treatability,

-

source water quality and concentration of ash added to prepare WAIW impact WEOM solubility
and therefore inferred implications of wildfire ash on drinking water quality and treatability, and

-

in absence of conducting a system-specific characterization of WEOM leaching from wildfire ash
with different mixing conditions (or developing an alternative leaching method), a 24-hour mixing
time is recommended for WAIW preparation for investigations (e.g., treatment performance
evaluations) focused on maximizing WEOM concentration.

The conclusions above highlight several important considerations for conducting investigations of wildfire
impacts on water quality and treatability in situations where wildfire impacts cannot be directly
investigated. Most notably, they collectively emphasize the importance of (i) specifying experimental
conditions and providing rationale for the WAIW preparation approach utilized (e.g., demonstrating a
worst-case scenario of maximal leaching of WEOM from wildfire ash, reflecting watershed conditions),
(ii) providing a range of results obtained at different leaching conditions, or alternatively (iii) clarifying that
results may be exploratory or comparative, but not necessarily quantitatively meaningful or relevant for
decision-making.
