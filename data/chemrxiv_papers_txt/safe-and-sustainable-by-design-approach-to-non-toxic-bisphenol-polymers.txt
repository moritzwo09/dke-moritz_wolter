Abstract: The majority of contemporary chemical processes rely on non-renewable resources
and reagents associated with negative impact on environment and human health. For this
reason, the Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) framework was launched by the European
Commission to guide the innovation process towards green and safe chemical products. In this
work, we demonstrate how SSbD guided a multidisciplinary study for facile identification of
non-toxic bisphenol A (BPA) analogues suitable for incorporation into high-performance
polymeric materials. Toxicological evaluation of a library of bisphenols with an in silico model
identified promising candidates that were synthesized from renewable lignin-sourced
feedstocks using benign catalytic routes. Subsequently, in vitro evaluation identified an optimal
BPA analogue, that was successfully incorporated into a polyester with attractive properties
for future consumer products. As such, the work showcases how the combination of synthetic
chemistry, toxicology, and computational modelling enables an effective workflow towards
renewable and inherently safe chemicals.

Introduction
Chemical synthesis of both bulk and fine chemicals is indispensable to the functioning of
modern society. The associated industries are among the major contributors to the European
Union’s economy, with a workforce of more than 3 million people and annual sales reaching
€760 billion (2022).1 However, the majority of contemporary industrial chemical processes
rely on non-renewable energy and raw materials associated with negative impact on human
health and environment, leading to detrimental consequences. Additionally, the annual costs
associated with the use of hazardous chemicals in the EU are counted in billions of euros.2 To
address these issues, the European Commission launched the Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design
(SSbD) framework in 2022.3 This voluntary framework is intended to guide the innovation
process in academia and chemical industry towards green production practices, which
minimize the use of substances with adverse effects on health, climate, and environment.
Toxicological studies constitute a fundamental part of SSbD by evaluating potential adverse
effects of chemicals and materials throughout their lifecycle. By integrating toxicological
assessments early in the design process, it is possible to identify and mitigate hazards, thereby
enabling the development of safer and more sustainable products. However, such assessments
traditionally include time-consuming and labor-intensive hazard screening of numerous
compounds. Therefore, shifting the workflow from reliance on morphological endpoints in
animal testing to a mechanism-driven approach is highly attractive, including incorporation of
computational modelling as well as molecular, human, and high-throughput in vitro data.4 At
the stage of synthetic method development, the 12 principles of Green Chemistry
can effectively guide the workflow towards sustainable processes.5 These principles include
the use of renewable feedstocks together with safe and environmentally-benign reagents and
solvents in chemical processes that minimize formation of waste and by-products, ultimately
leading to production of inherently safe products without compromising their consumer
properties. Employing catalytic processes is a key in this endeavor, as it enables more atomefficient synthesis by using a continuously regenerated mediator, which serves as a substitute
for stoichiometric reagents and minimizes formation of chemical waste. Nevertheless, many
catalytic transformations suffer from catalyst deactivation or degradation, and further
development of robust and recyclable catalysts remains to be of great interest.
Bisphenols represent a prominent class of chemical compounds used in production of
polymeric materials with excellent thermal, mechanical, and optical properties.6 Bisphenol A
(BPA) is the most widely-used member of this class of compounds, and is currently produced
on multi-million ton scale per year.7 BPA is used in manufacturing of materials for consumer
products, such as packaging in food industry and epoxy resins in construction and furniture
industries.8 It has been known for a long time that BPA can activate estrogen receptors (ER),
mimicking the biological activity of endogenous estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol (E2),9 and a
number of studies have linked BPA to adverse effects on both human health and the
environment.7,10 The use of BPA in food contact materials (FCM) is therefore highly regulated,
with a complete ban for use in nursing bottles since 2011 in the EU. The adverse effects of

BPA have initiated a wide quest for the development of benign alternatives.11 Despite extensive
efforts, the majority of the proposed BPA substitutes display similar endocrine disruptive
effects12 with only a few exceptions.13 Notably, introduction of methoxy groups onto the aryl
backbone of BPA analogues was recently shown to significantly reduce the adverse exposure
effects, while maintaining applicability of such compounds for the production of highperformance polymeric materials.14 Another advantage of this class of compounds stems from
the high abundance of methoxylated phenols in lignin — a widely available side-stream
product from the pulp and paper industries, generated on multi-million ton scale per year.15
Renewable phenolic compounds, such as guaiacol and syringol, can be derived from lignin,
making them the ideal candidates for selection of safe and sustainable BPA analogs.16
Herein, we showcase a Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design approach for the development of nontoxic bisphenol-based polymers. This multidisciplinary work demonstrates how in silico
assessment can reliably predict toxicological profiles of the envisioned bio-based monomers,
thereby minimizing the synthetic efforts towards assembling compound libraries for in vitro
toxicological assessments. The in vitro toxicological studies are then used as a primary guide
for selection of suitable monomers to yield sustainable polymeric materials with suitable
consumer properties, minimized hazards during production and environmental impact.

Results and discussion
Guided by the SSbD principles, we implemented the following workflow towards non-toxic
bisphenol-based polymers (Figure 1): (1) Assessment of toxicological properties for a library
of bisphenol candidates with an in silico model. (2) Catalytic synthesis of the most attractive
candidates, guided by the Green Chemistry principles. (3) Assessment of toxicological
properties of the synthesized bisphenols with in vitro assays. (4) Large-scale synthesis of the
prime bisphenol candidate, its incorporation into a polyester chain, and assessment of the
material properties. Additionally, the corresponding BPA-derived polyester was synthesized
for comparison.

Inspired by previous studies that indicated that electron-rich bisphenols display low endocrinedisrupting activity,14 we aimed to systematically assess a library of methoxylated bisphenols,
which could be potentially produced from renewable sources. An in silico model trained on
PubChem ER-alpha (ERα) agonist and antagonist assay data was employed for evaluation of a

library of 162 bisphenol candidates (Figure 2a, see the ESI for details). As a result, the
Conformal Prediction p-values for ERα agonist and antagonist activities for each of the
bisphenol candidates were assessed (Figure 2b), and synthetically-accessible bisphenols with
the lowest activity (on or close to the Pareto optimal front) were selected for further evaluation.
The selected bisphenol candidates based on phenol, guaiacol, and syringol were synthesized
using Lewis or Brønsted acid catalysis (Figure 2c). For accessing bisphenols with up to one
carbon substituent on the bridging methylene carbon, we adapted a procedure from our
previous work on deoxygenative functionalization of benzylic alcohols.17 In this catalytic
approach, Friedel-Crafts-type alkylation of benzylic alcohols is catalyzed by moisture-tolerant
zirconium- or hafnium-based metal salts under close to ambient conditions. Optimization of
the reaction conditions for the synthesis of targeted bisphenol candidates included selection of
the optimal catalyst, transition to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) as a renewable solvent,
and optimization of the catalyst and reactant concentrations for efficient and selective
formation of the desired products. The bisphenols with up to two substituents on the bridging
methylene carbon were synthesized with a more conventional Brønsted acid-catalyzed
approach. Both protocols provided the expected products in reasonable yields, while several of
the bisphenols were formed as a mixture of p,p’/m,p’-regioisomers (Figure 2d). The latter were
separated as individual compounds by column chromatography prior to the in vitro
toxicological assays, unless otherwise noted.
The endocrine-disrupting activity of the synthesized bisphenols was assessed with two in vitro
assays employing the MCF-7 and VM7LucE2 human mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines,
expressing both human ER forms, ERα and ERβ (Figures 3a and 3b). The MCF-7 proliferation
assay gauges the ability of evaluated bisphenols to mimic the activity of native 17β-estradiol
(E2) in stimulating cell proliferation, while VM7LucE2 assay evaluates the affinity of
bisphenols to the estrogen receptors relative to E2. In the first of the assays, the MCF-7 cells
were treated with E2, BPA or the targeted bisphenols for 72 h at the concentrations covering
the median bisphenols exposure levels in the population (10-12 to 10-4 M), and the estrogenic
activities were determined as half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for each of the
evaluated compounds (Figure S3). Additionally, a qualitative assessment of the influence of
the tested bisphenols on cells proliferation and viability was used to visualize the endocrinedisrupting activity at each concentration (Figure 3a). Six of the evaluated bisphenols had
minimal effect on cell proliferation (p,p’-3, p,p’/m,p’-4, p,p’/m,p’-5, and p,p’-14), while the
others displayed EC50 values that were either higher or on par with BPA, that is promoting
significant estrogen-driven cell proliferation. Subsequently, MCF7-derived VM7Luc4E2 cells,
stably transfected with a human ER-responsive luciferase reporter gene, were used to evaluate
binding and activation of ERα and ERβ by the bisphenol candidates. The estrogenic activity of
bisphenols was calculated as the relative maximum %E2 (%RME2, a measure of response
amplitude), i.e., the relative luminescence observed with the tested compound at a specific
concentration relative to the maximum luminescence observed with E2 at the same
concentration.18 According to the OECD test guideline No. 455, the %RME2 values less than
20% were considered insignificant.19 In this assay, BPA demonstrated a detectable response at

almost all tested concentrations, whereas the majority of bisphenol candidates displayed lower
estrogenic activity. Notably, three bisphenols displayed no estrogenic activity at any
concentration: p,p’-3, p,p’-5 and m,p’-5 (Figure 3b). An overlay of estrogenic activities from
in silico and in vitro studies with the VM7LucE2 assay (using averaged values over the
assessed concentration range) demonstrated that 18 out of 20 synthesized bisphenols were both
predicted and experimentally measured to have lower activity compared to BPA (Figure 3c).
This excellent correlation clearly demonstrates the capacity of the in silico model to provide
valid predictions for this compound class, despite being a general model trained on a dataset
with 6754 compounds of wide structural diversity including only 60 bisphenols. Only two
bisphenols — p,p’-2 and p,p’-9 — stood out as outliers, demonstrating higher and lower
predicted activities relative to BPA, respectively, while displaying opposite trend for activities
in the in vitro assay.
The data obtained from both in vitro assays identified bisphenols p,p’-3 and p,p’-5 as exhibiting
minimal to no estrogenic activity. Among these, bisphenol p,p’-3 could be accessed with
significantly higher yield and regioselectivity relative to p,p’-5, thereby, the former was
selected for scaled-up synthesis and subsequent incorporation into a polymer matrix. The
scaled-up synthesis was performed under modified conditions in order to reduce the amount of
excess reagents and lower the catalyst loading, delivering the desired bisphenol 3 in high yield
(72%), but as a mixture of regioisomers (p,p’/m,p’-3 7.5:1). Notably, previous reports indicated
that the minor m,p’-3 regioisomer displays even lower estrogenic activity compared to p,p’3,14d thus the regioisomeric mixture 3 was used for polymer synthesis without further
separation. While bisphenol 3 was previously incorporated into polycarbonate and epoxy
resins,14b,d in this work we sought to incorporate 3 into a polyester, as this class of polymers is
more attractive from the sustainability and circular material flow perspectives.20 To overcome
the lower reactivity of phenolic alcohol groups for polycondensation, bisphenol 3 was first
functionalized as bisglycol ether derivative 3-G with ethylene carbonate (Figure 4a). A
bisglycolated BPA derivative BPA-G was synthesized using the same procedure for
comparison. The bisglycolated bisphenols were each polymerized by reaction with dimethyl
succinate (DMS) — a potentially biobased aliphatic diester — to furnish two polyester
materials, 3-G-DMS and BPA-G-DMS. The number and weight average molar masses (M̅n
and M̅w, respectively) and dispersities (Đ) of the purified materials were determined by sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis, displaying higher molar masses and dispersity for
3-G-DMS relative to BPA-G-DMS (M̅n = 21.7 vs. 15.2 kDa, M̅w = 92.1 vs. 33.2 kDa and Ð =
4.2 vs. 2.2). The higher M̅n, M̅w, and Ð values for 3-G-DMS presumably stem from the higher
flexibility of 3-G monomer, which bears no substituents at the bridging methylene carbon,
unlike BPA-G. This could facilitate the polymerization leading to higher molar mass.
Furthermore, the 7.5:1 mixture of the p,p’/m,p’-regioisomers in 3 may contribute to the higher
Ð and more supple nature of the resulting polymer. The higher flexibility of the 3-G monomer
compared to BPA-G was further illustrated by the corresponding properties of the 3-G-DMS
and BPA-G-DMS polymers (Figure 4b). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), using films
with dimensions of 30 mm × 5 mm × 0.5 mm (length × width × thickness), demonstrated that
7

the storage modulus (E′) of the glassy plateau was observed at 24 °C for the 3-G-DMS
polyester and at 34 °C for its BPA analogue. These observations correlate well with glass
transition temperatures (Tg) of 22 °C and 33 °C for 3-G-DMS and BPA-G-DMS, respectively,
as determined from the temperatures at which the curves of E″ reached local maxima (tan δ
max). This trend was further verified when assessing the Tg values by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S54, Table S4). While polymer materials are typically rigid and
glassy-like below Tg, an elastic and rubbery behavior is observed when the temperature is above
Tg. Similarly, a lower Tg reflects a more flexible chain structure that can retain the ability to
rotate even at lower temperatures. As such, the lower Tg of the 3-G-DMS polymer suggested
that this material was more supple compared to the more rigid BPA analogue. In agreement,
the mechanical properties of the two polyesters determined by tensile testing at room
temperature, demonstrated that BPA-G-DMS exhibits higher elastic modulus and lower
elongation at break, i.e., it is stiffer and less flexible compared to 3-G-DMS (478.2 vs. 185.1
MPa and 65% vs. 237%, respectively). Interestingly, both polyesters displayed very good
thermal stability, as evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), with thermal degradation
onsets (T5) at ~345–370 °C and degradation maxima (Td) at ~390–400 °C. As expected, both
polyesters were thermally more stable (~60 °C higher T5 values) compared to the corresponding
glycolated bisphenol monomers as a result of their higher molar masses and decreased content
of end groups after polymerization. The char yields (CY) of both polymers after TGA pyrolysis
at 600 °C were determined to be 26–28%, which is typical for polymer with high content of
aromatic structures. Finally, the DSC analysis confirmed that both polyesters were completely
amorphous.
Compared to previously reported polyesters based on methoxylated BPA analogs and aliphatic
linkers,21 the 3-G-DMS polyester displayed similar Tg and tensile stress at break (~3 MPa).
However, while the former produced brittle films with only ~1% elongation at break, 3-GDMS formed flexible films with elongation at break of more than 200%. In addition, 3-GDMS displayed a significantly improved thermal stability (~100 °C higher). This thermal
stability is also on par with the previously reported methoxylated bisphenol-based
polyterephthalate.14b This is noteworthy, since thermal stability of a polymer is typically
proportional to its aromatic content, and 3-G-DMS features only a limited amount of aromatic
constituents.

Conclusions
A multidisciplinary Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) framework enabled synthesis of
a non-toxic bisphenol-based polyester with attractive mechanical and thermal properties. We
implemented a workflow that minimized synthetic efforts and associated chemical exposure
by initial evaluation of endocrine disruptive effects for a library of bisphenols using an in silico
model. This predictive evaluation resulted in the selection of a limited number of promising
candidates that were synthesized from lignin-sourced reagents using renewable solvent and
non-toxic catalysts. These candidates were evaluated for estrogenic activity by an in vitro
toxicity assessment, which resulted in the selection of one non-estrogenic bisphenol that was
successfully incorporated into a polyester matrix. As such, the present study demonstrates how
the SSbD principles can guide the development of sustainable and safe materials with attractive
properties for future applications in consumer products.
