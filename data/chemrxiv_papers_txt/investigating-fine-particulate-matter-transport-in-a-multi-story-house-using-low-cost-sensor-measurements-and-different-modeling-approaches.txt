Abstract
This work investigates the transport of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in a multi-story test house
using cooking emissions as a point source. The test house was instrumented with 13 PM2.5
monitors, and the particle sources included pan cooking and air frying, as well as ambient PM2.5
penetration during periods of no indoor activity. In the absence of indoor sources, we observed
about 10 % of ambient PM2.5 concentrations penetrating indoors with a time lag of 1 h. Similar
peak PM2.5 concentrations were observed for pan frying and air frying of the same food
ingredients. A cross-correlation analysis showed that it took 2 to 4 min for kitchen peak
concentrations to reach other sensors on the first floor and about 8 min to reach the second floor.
PM2.5 concentrations were heterogeneous on the first floor, with non-kitchen areas peaking at 45
% ± 9 % of kitchen levels. Second-floor concentrations were more homogeneous, peaking at 18
% ± 2 % of kitchen levels. Using a typical occupancy scenario, the highest estimated personal
PM2.5 exposure (44 %) was experienced in the kitchen/dining area, which accounted for 9 % of
the time spent at home. We used three modeling approaches to analyze particle transport
throughout the house, with increasing input requirements: a multi-box model, an empirical
model, and the NIST CONTAM model. All models predicted time integrated PM2.5
concentrations on the 1st and 2nd floors, with R2 between 0.57 and 0.82 and RMSE from 6 µg m-3
to 11 µg m-3.

Graphical Abstract

1. Introduction
Airborne pollutants enter the indoor environment from two major sources: (1) outdoor air entry
and (2) emissions from indoor processes and activities. In efforts to become more energy
efficient, building envelopes are designed and constructed to be more airtight. This reduced
infiltration results in a decrease in air change rates (ACR). While this can limit exposure to
outdoor contaminants, without adequate mechanical ventilation, reduced infiltration can also
exacerbate exposure from indoor sources since the emissions may have a longer indoor residence
time. Such indoor sources include cooking, emissions from building materials, heating and
cooling systems, household cleaning products, and a variety of building occupant behaviors [1].
Other energy saving methods or climate adaption techniques in houses can have negative impacts
on indoor air quality. Increased thermal insulation or increased cooling equipment may increase
the likelihood of condensation and indoor humidity levels, which can lead to potential biological
growth [2].

While there is a wide variety of potential contaminants in indoor air [3], particulate matter (PM)
is one of great concern. Two of the main contributors to indoor PM are cooking and heating
using biofuels [4]. While combustion for heating purposes is more prevalent in some developing
regions, indoor PM generation from cooking is prevalent everywhere due to high heat levels
emitting solid and liquid particles [5]. In a study investigating cooking in 15 different Australian
houses, He et al. observed peak PM2.5 concentrations in the order of 750 µg m-3 during frying
activities [6].
Residential exposure to PM2.5 is dependent on the time spent in different indoor
microenvironments by each occupant. Concentrations of cooking emissions, for example, are
likely to peak in the kitchen and then decrease as particles are transported throughout the indoor
environment. Concentrations decrease primarily due to dilution with the indoor air, dilution with
outdoor air, and depositional losses to indoor surfaces [7,8]. Ultimately, in a home with closed
external doors and windows, a small fraction of particles is expected to leave to outdoors via
exfiltration, while the majority of particles deposit indoors [7,9].
Low-cost, or consumer-oriented PM sensors are becoming increasingly frequent in applications
of indoor air quality and exposure assessment. They allow for citizen science and also research
applications where many measurements are required, such as investigations of spatiotemporal
trends of pollutants both indoors and outdoors. However, low-cost sensor use comes with a
tradeoff in data quality. Studies have shown that the Plantower PMS sensor, a common particle
counter used in many low-cost PM2.5 monitors, can present significant differences in
concentration when compared to laboratory-grade instrumentation, partially due to their principle
of operation using a miniaturized optical detection system based on light scattering [10,11].
Concentration measurements through particle light scattering are dependent on particle density,
hygroscopicity, refraction index, and composition [12]. Variations in environmental conditions
(e.g., temperature, relative humidity) have also been shown to skew the concentration readings
from these instruments [13,14]. However, if used in an informed manner, the benefits of low-cost
sensors have the potential to outweigh their limitations.
This work presents results from concurrent measurements using over a dozen PurpleAir monitors
that use Plantower sensors deployed inside a three-level test house to investigate the transport of

PM2.5 emissions from cooking activities, along with transport modeling for the measurement
periods. Specific objectives were to (1) Investigate PM2.5 concentration gradients and transport
time; (2) Compare three different modeling approaches to predict PM2.5 concentrations
throughout a house; and (3) Calculate the potential PM2.5 exposure for an everyday activity
pattern. These results can be leveraged to inform indoor PM2.5 exposure from point sources in
residential indoor environments.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. The CASA field campaign
Measurements for this work were performed during the Chemical Assessments of Surfaces and
Air (CASA) field campaign, which took place from February 25th to April 2nd, 2022, at the NetZero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) at the US National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
The 1100 m3 NZERTF test house was designed to be ≈60 % more energy efficient than houses
built to meet the requirements of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code and, as such,
yields a low infiltration rate (≈0.05 h-1). It is a 393 m2 (4,227 ft2) 3-story, 4-bedroom and 3bathroom house that has an open-floor concept kitchen/dining area on the first floor. The first
floor has an area of 141 m2 (1,518 ft2) while the second floor has a 111 m2 (1,191 ft2) area. There
are 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms on the second floor. The house also has an unfinished basement
and an attic within the thermal envelope. The heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)
consists of two independently operated heating and cooling air conditioning systems: a large duct
(low velocity) and a small diameter (high velocity) system. There is also a dedicated outdoor
mechanical ventilation system that can be operated as an Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV)
system or a Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) system with a total mechanical ventilation rate of
≈0.19 h-1. The HRV/ERV combined with infiltration result in a total ACR of ≈0.24 h-1
(supplemental Table S1) The basement has no air conditioning return air, only air conditioning
supply, and there are passive vents connecting the basement to the first floor and the attic to the
second floor of the house. The air conditioning fan was constantly on through the experiments.
The mechanical ventilation system supply vents are located in the kitchen, southwest bedroom,
southeast bedroom, and main bedroom while return vents are located on the bathroom ceilings.

The CASA study was an intensive indoor air and surface chemistry experimental investigation
with participation of over a dozen research groups from United States and Canada. Additional
details about CASA are described elsewhere [15]. While CASA lasted for 49 days and
encompassed several types of perturbations to the house, the work presented here includes only
two types of datasets: cooking experiments and ambient PM penetration into the house. Briefly,
eight cooking experiments (CE1 - CE8) were performed over the course of three experimental
days (March 13-15), involving the same ingredients and preparation. Six of these were done
using a frying pan while the other two (CE4 and CE7) used an air fryer. The cooking process
consisted of heating up the pan/air fryer with canola oil, then adding sliced green bell peppers,
followed with tater tots, and bacon. Food items were cooked sequentially with each having a
cooking time of ≈ 10 min. The peak oil temperature for the six pan events were 238 °C to 277 °C
(460 °F to 531 °F). While not remaining at this high of temperature for the full duration of the
cooking period, this maximum temperature range reached the smoke point for canola oil (220 °C
to 230 °C, 428 °F to 446 °F).
The first two cooking experiments (CE1 and CE2) were performed under high indoor relative
humidity (RH, 60 % to 80 % on the first floor, slightly lower upstairs), which was generated
using a whole-house humidifier. The remaining experiments experienced lower RH (30 % to
50 %), with no humidity control. The temperature inside the house remained consistent during
these days with a gradient between the four floors (supplemental Table S2). The HRV exhaust,
outdoor, and return flows had an average airflow rate of 231 ± 21 m3 h-1 (136 ± 13 scfm) during
the experimental cooking days. The HVAC supply flowrate was higher than the other three flows
with a value of 1950 m3 h-1 (1150 scfm), but it was reduced to around 1360 m3 h-1 (800 scfm)
from 1:00 pm to 11:50 pm on March 14th and 11:50 am to 11:59 pm on March 15th. This constant
HVAC flow recirculated air throughout the house at a rate defined henceforth as the recirculation
rate (RR, of 1.04 h-1). The outdoor ACR was 0.24  0.01 h-1 during the experimental days
included in this work, as determined by the decay of daily sulfur hexafluoride injections.
Additional house conditions for this experimental period are found in Figure S1 and Figure S2.
There were other cooking-related experiments performed during CASA (e.g., boiling a vinegar
glaze and cooking popcorn in a microwave oven), but those are not included in this work

because particle production was low for vinegar cooking and the microwave cooking was
performed closely with other activities.

2.2. Instrumentation and their locations
This work used PM2.5 measurements made with 13 units of the PurpleAir PM monitor (PA-II,
PurpleAir, Inc.). These instruments were distributed as follows: five on the first floor, five on the
second floor, and one each in the basement, attic, and outdoors (Figure 1 and Table S3). The
kitchen sensor was located ≈ 1 m above the kitchen counter where cooking was performed. Each
PurpleAir contains two Plantower particle sensors (PMS-5003, Plantower).

circles): first floor (A), second floor (B), side (C), and front (D).

2.3. Laboratory collocation and data corrections
For quality assurance, the 13 PurpleAir sensors used in this study were collocated with an
aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) using a butanolbased condensation particle counter in a 38 m3 (1342 ft3) well-mixed test room in which cooking
activities were performed. The same food cooked at CASA was prepared for these experiments,
although amounts were reduced due to the smaller size of the test room. In short, experiments

encompassed four emission events where olive oil was heated on a pan by an electric hot plate
and then small amounts of bell peppers, tater tots, and bacon were cooked. The chamber
temperature was ≈ 27 C and the relative humidity was ≈ 30 %, which is within the range
observed during the low-RH cooking experiments at CASA. To convert number-based
measurements by the SMPS and APS into mass-based concentrations, we assumed spherical
particles and a density of 1 g cm-3. Results from the SMPS and APS were then combined to
calculate PM2.5 concentrations.
Average PM2.5 concentrations on six-minute intervals were compared between the two sets of
instruments and a linear regression was performed to determine a correction factor for the
PurpleAir sensors. The linear regression showed that the PurpleAir tends to overestimate PM2.5
concentrations, as previously reported for indoor and outdoor sources [16–19]. PurpleAir
concentrations were about two times higher than those measured by the comparison instruments.
Then, this correction factor was applied to the CASA cooking events, where PM2.5, corrected = 0.49
 PM2.5, PurpleAir (a ≈ 5 g m-3 intercept of the regression curve was ignored). Peak corrected
injection concentrations ranged from 30 to 250 g m-3. The time series for the collocation
experiment, and comparison within PurpleAir instruments and between them and the reference
instrumentation is presented in supplemental Figures S3 through Figure S8 and accompanying
text. Although the use of laboratory calibrations to correct field data is generally discouraged
[20], we strived to approximate the aerosol emission characteristics (size, composition, lack of
aging) as well as the environmental conditions (temperature, RH, and lack of direct solar
radiation) of the low-RH cooking experiments performed during CASA. We did not use field
data for corrections due to missing field data from the APS instrument.

2.4. Time series analysis of particle transport
To investigate the temporal behavior of indoor transport of cooking emissions, we measured the
time lag between the peak PM2.5 concentration observed by the kitchen sensor and by the
remaining 11 sensors distributed throughout the house. The time lag between each sensor and the
kitchen sensor was determined through a cross-correlation analysis, and only time lags with a
correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 were used. The height of the peak PM 2.5 concentrations
were also compared directly. The fractions of source peak values were calculated by dividing the

sensor concentration at its respective lag time by the peak concentration observed by the kitchen
sensor.

2.5. Modeling PM2.5 concentrations throughout the house
We used the opportunity of real-time measurements in a dozen locations in the house to compare
three different modeling approaches, with varying levels of difficulty and input requirements, to
predict PM2.5 concentrations throughout the house. These three approaches consist of (1) a multibox model in which the house is represented as four inter-connected continuously stirred tank
reactors (CSTR), (2) an empirical model adapted from the literature based on indoor distances,
and (3) a multizone model developed in CONTAM [21]. Table 1 describes the main inputs and
outputs of each model.

The number of inputs, or the difficulty to obtain them, increases with each model. While the box
model is arguably the most generalizable, the main output is simpler: an average concentration
for each zone of the house. The empirical model requires parallel measurements in several indoor
locations in order to determine its coefficients, so it cannot be transferred to other homes without
using multiple sensors, and it outputs location-specific concentrations. CONTAM requires
several home-specific inputs, including leakage areas, temperatures, and room volumes, as well
as PM2.5 mass generation rates, but it is capable of estimating the PM2.5 concentrations in each
room of the house.
2.5.1. Approach #1: Multi-box model
This approach is based on a fundamental Continuously-Stirred-Tank-Reactor (CSTR) massbalance equation (Eq. 1), applied to four control volumes, or zones: (1) the kitchen/dining area,
where emissions were measured and assumed to quickly spread through the entire volume and
then disperse to the rest of the first floor; (2) the remaining air volume of the first floor
(excluding the kitchen/dining area), for which an average concentration is estimated and
assumed to then transport to the second floor and the basement; and (3) the air volume of the
second floor, and (4) the air volume of the basement.

Eq. 1,

where dM/dt is the PM2.5 mass accumulation in the control volume (also described as VdC/dt), Q
is the airflow rate through the modeled space, Cin is the PM2.5 concentration entering the space, C
is the PM2.5 concentration in the modeled space, S is the PM2.5 source within the modeled space,
and L is the PM2.5 loss within the modeled space.
The schematic in Figure 2 shows the modeled spaces with airflow paths considered for each
space. Airflow between spaces was primarily driven by the continuously operating HVAC fan.
The total airflow rate in and out of each zone (Qk, Q1, Q2, and Qb) were assumed to equal   V,
where  = ACR + RR (1.40 h-1), and V is the air volume of each space (excluding cabinetry). In
this model, not all airflow carries particles, so airflows that carry a concentration of zero particles
(e.g., coming from outside) were excluded from the model. In order to balance internal airflows,
it was assumed that the airflow from the first floor is split between the second floor (70 %) and

10

the basement (30 %), which was supported by air condition system supply flow balometer
measurements performed by NIST (data not shown here). We also assumed that the outflow from
the second floor is split between the first floor (32 %) and the basement (68 %), to enable some
recirculation of air into the first floor.

Figure 2. Multi-box model developed to describe the PM2.5 mass flows through four
compartments in the test house: the kitchen/dining area (Vkitchen), the first floor excluding the
kitchen/dining area (V1), the second floor (V2), and the basement (Vb). Flowrates into and out of
each space are assumed to be promoted by the ventilation rate  (RR + ACR).
The discrete solution for Eq. 1 for the PM2.5 mass accumulation C during a period t is shown
in Eq. 2 for the first floor, with similar solutions for the second floor and the basement
(Supplemental Eq. S1 and Eq. S2 and accompanying text). The inputs for the second floor and
the basement are the modeled concentrations on the first floor outputted by Eq. 2. As such, the
only experimental concentrations used in the model are those measured in the kitchen.

first floor (excluding the kitchen/dining area) and the second floor, respectively.  is the particle
depositional losses to surfaces for the first floor, measured experimentally during particle decay periods
minus ACR and RR (0.21 h-1, Table S4); and t is the time step for the model, set to be equal to the
PurpleAir time resolution of 2 min.

Due to recirculation of air from the second floor to the first floor and basement, this model was
run in an iterative fashion. The model equations are run sequentially to determine concentrations
on the first floor, then second floor, then basement. During the first iteration, all particle inputs
are zero except for the kitchen. Then, second-floor results of the previous iteration are used as an
additional input for subsequent iterations on the first floor and basement, as shown by Equation 2
and the arrows in Figure 2. We found that after 3 iterations, the results changed by less than
0.2 g m-3, so this model was run for a total of 4 iterations for each zone. Additional descriptions
and model assumptions are described in the supplemental file.
2.5.2. Approach #2: Empirical model
Shen et. al. proposed a model for the temporal and spatial variation of PM2.5 in a single-floor
apartment in Beijing, China [22]. In their apartment setting, there were two windows that
promoted significant PM2.5 infiltration from outdoors, and one PM2.5 source from the kitchen.
They developed the relationship described by Eq. 3:

Where Ci,t-lag-i is the concentration (µg m-3) at the outdoor and indoor source sensor at given lag
times; Lis the pathway distance (m) from a given indoor site to the outdoor (Lo1 and Lo2) and
source sensor (Lk) (Table S5); a, b, c, and d are the regression coefficients. Shen et. al. found the
respective regression coefficients for a, b, c, and d to be 0.181 ± 0.005, 0.190 ± 0.004, 0.437 ±
0.004, and 0.794 ± 0.002.
The NZERTF test house used for CASA has a tight building envelope and low ACR. So, unlike
Shen et al., we opted to include just one infiltration term that represents the distance from each
sensor to its closest HRV duct, which is expected to be the main point of injection of ambient PM
into the house. Lag times of ambient PM penetration to each room was determined from three

instances of high ambient (outdoor) concentration events (Figure S9). Indoor/outdoor regressions
for this period and average time lag times used for the ambient term are available in Table S6.
For the distance between each sensor and the indoor PM source in the kitchen, we used straightline distances to the kitchen sensor (ignoring any physical barriers) for the first floor and
explored three options for the second floor to investigate how this model can be adapted to a
multi-floor residence: (1) the straight-line distance, accounting for the height differences between
floors, (2) the vertical distance between the first and second floors, (3) a vertical path from the
cooking surface to the second floor, then horizontally to each sensor, again by straight-line
distances and not pathway distance (Figure S10, Table S5). The model adjusted for this work is
as follows (Eq. 4).

sensor; Ck,t-lag-k is the PM2.5 concentration at the kitchen sensor at t minus the lag time; a, b, and c
are the regression coefficients.
2.5.3. Approach #3: CONTAM model
CONTAM is a multizone airflow and contaminant transport software model developed by NIST
to determine airflow rates, contaminant concentrations, and personal exposure [21]. CONTAM is
used to construct a digital idealization of a building and virtually recreate the environment. The
model uses measured temperatures, HVAC airflow, and HRV airflow to determine pressure
differences, airflows and contaminant migration between adjacent zones.
The NZERTF model comprises individual zones for each room and closet in the test house.
Throughout the test period, measurements for the following model parameters were recorded:
indoor and outdoor temperatures, wind speed and direction, total HRV airflow rates, total HVAC
airflow rate, and CO2 concentrations. All values, shown in Table S7, were recorded every minute
and used as inputs in the model. Zone volumes are shown in Table S8.

The previously developed detailed CONTAM model for the NZERTF [23] was modified for this
effort as summarized the supplementary information (SI section 1.8). In brief, modifications for
this work include breaking the single zone open floor plan living/dining volume into two zones,
breaking the single zone two-story entry foyer into two zones, and adding leakage flows into and
out of the basement from the HRV ventilation system and HVAC system as described in the
Supplementary Information. In addition, five assumptions were made in the modeling effort.
These assumptions include smoothing the measured data over gaps, CO2 injection flows rates, a
balanced HVAC system, closets with the same temperatures as adjoining rooms, and the fraction
of the HVAC flow delivered to the basement.
Before modeling the cooking events the model was validated. The updated CONTAM model was
run using inputs from days where CO2 was injected as a non-reactive tracer during the postCASA test period. CO2 was injected on six occasions and at three locations (basement, first floor,
second floor). Two of these injections were used to adjust duct leakage areas in the model
reflecting the NZERTF environment during CASA, and the other four injections used for
validation. While modeling the CO2 injections, the need for three of the previously mentioned
model adjustments became apparent. First, the separation of the living room into its own zone
was required due to mixing issues. The living room was the only first floor location where the
CO2 concentration was measured. Separating the living room from the kitchen, where CO2 was
injected on the first floor, was necessary to produce a realistic CO2 concentration peak shape for
the CO2 measurement in the living room. This is due to the uniform concentration assumption for
each zone. Second, the separation of the foyer into two zones was needed to better capture the
thermal stratification of the two-story space and the resulting airflows. The foyer was
horizontally separated into two zones y floor. Third, the transport of the CO2 to the basement was
faster than the HVAC supply air in the model could provide. Hence, leakage in the amount of 10
% total HVAC airflow was diverted to the basement through both the supply and return.
After confirming the CO2 concentrations produced by the updated NZERTF model reasonably fit
measured CO2 concentrations during the other four CO2 injections, the updated NZERTF model
was used to simulate indoor particulate matter, specifically PM2.5, resulting from the cooking
events using the appropriate measured parameters for each cooking day. There were four
assumptions for this model:

1. The PM2.5 measurement in the kitchen did not increase until the first food item was added
to the hotplate. As a result, the simulated cooking event start time was set to the time at
which measured PM2.5 began to increase.
2. The dining room sensor was located within the same zone that the cooking took place but
with more physical separation from the cooktop than the kitchen sensor. Hence, it was
assumed that the dining room sensor was more representative of the entire kitchen
volume PM2.5 concentration and was used as the reference point for the mass of PM 2.5
emitted into the NZERTF during each cooking event.
3. Since the mass of PM2.5 that was produced during each cooking event was unknown, a
constant simulated PM2.5 mass generation rate was generated from the kitchen zone data.
The PM2.5 mass generation rate was set to an amount such that the peak simulated
concentration in the dining room matched the peak measured concentration in the dining
room (to within 1 %). The simulated PM2.5 mass generation rate for each cooking event is
shown in Table 2. This generation rate was assumed to be constant from the time the
cooking event started to the peak concentration time. For some cooking events (e.g.,
CE6) this constant source rate assumption was not ideal.

4. The median PM2.5 particle size by mass was assumed to be 0.7 m, based upon data from

similar cooking (stir fry) events during the HOMEChem study [24]. As such this value
was used to determine the HVAC filter efficiency (0.2 filter efficiency as defined in

CONTAM) and room deposition value 0.11 h-1 [25]. The deposition value was applied to
every zone in the model as the PM2.5 depositional loss rate.
5. Modeled initial PM2.5 values were the measured values in each zone prior to the cooking

event. Each cooking event was modeled independently of other events.

2.6. Indoor microenvironmental PM2.5 exposure
To explore the implications of cooking for house inhabitants we performed a PM 2.5 exposure
analysis using a typical schedule throughout a house which included two cooking events. This
exposure scenario was adapted from Klepeis [26,27], and includes a total of 16.5 hours in the
house. Time spent indoors includes: 10 h in the bedroom, 3 h in the living room, 1.5 h in the
kitchen/dining room, 1 h in the bathroom, and 1 h in the home office (first floor bedroom).
For this analysis, we combined datasets from cooking events, including post-cooking decay
periods throughout the house, as well as datasets for outdoor PM2.5 penetration during
background periods. This was necessary because the test house did not experience any PM2.5
penetration during the experimental cooking days (observed by a decay period to near-zero
indoor PM2.5 concentrations and further discussed in the empirical modeling results, below).
Background concentrations were used from Sunday, March 6th. The house remained closed and
unoccupied throughout that day, so the concentrations observed indoors were due to penetration
from outdoor particles. On that day, the 24-h average ambient PM2.5 concentration was
14.9 µg m-3, peaking at 33.7 µg m-3. Indoor concentrations peaked at 18 µg m-3 and averaged
8 µg m-3 in the main spaces of the house (Figure S9b). Exposure periods following cooking
events encompassed the summed ambient and cooking concentrations and accounted for the
average decay periods observed for cooking events CE1-CE8.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations during cooking events
For the three cooking days, the first floor (excluding the kitchen sensor) had a 24-hr average
PM2.5 concentration of 3.5 ± 0.4 µg m-3, while the second floor had an average of 2.0 ± 0.2 µg m3. The 24-hr average values for the attic, basement, and outside sensors were 0.1, 2.3, and 0.9

second floors are shown in Figure S11. Figure 4 presents time series of PM2.5 concentrations for

Figure 4. PM2.5 concentrations throughout the house during the 8 cooking events used in this
work (March 13, 2022 through March 16, 2022), measured by PurpleAir sensors (µg m-3).
Concentrations presented here were corrected using post-calibration experiments (PM2.5, corrected =
0.49PM2.5, PurpleAir). Cooking events 4 and 7 were performed in an air fryer, all others on a pan
on electric cooktop. Note that the y-axis scale is different for each panel and the legend in the
first panel applies to all panels.
Although the researchers strived to replicate cooking experiments exactly, there was variability
in observed concentrations and temporal behavior from cooking the same meals, for both air
fryer and pan cooking. This was also the case during the HOMEChem study [24]. Differences in
emissions are expected as they depend on many factors including cooking oil type, food being
cooked, temperature, additives, and the room air volume as well as local airflow conditions [28].

The peak PM2.5 concentrations for the cooking experiments ranged from 31 µg m-3 (CE7, air
fryer) to 240 µg m-3 (CE6, pan frying), as recorded by the source (kitchen) sensor. The peak
concentrations resulting from pan frying were lower than those reported in other studies [6,29].
The second highest concentration peak recorded by the kitchen sensor was for air frying during
CE4 (226 µg m-3). Some events produced only one prominent concentration peak (CE1, CE3,
CE4, and arguably CE7), while others produced multiple discernible peaks (notably CE2, CE5,
and CE8). The start of each concentration peak in the kitchen coincided with adding new
ingredients or flipping or stirring them in the pan.

3.2. PM2.5 transport through the house: peak time lags
The overall time lags for each sensor as well as their peak magnitudes with respect to the
measurements in the kitchen for all cooking events are presented in Figure 5. At no point during
the cooking experiments did the attic sensor detect a change in PM2.5 concentration, so it was
omitted from further analysis. More detailed cross-correlation results are presented in Figure S12
and Figure S13, and Table S9 through Table S11.

peak concentration relative to source peak. Whiskers represent the range of data within 1.5 the
interquartile range from the first and third quartiles, excluding outliers. Average values are
presented in Table S9.
The first-floor sensors generally saw small time lags from the cooking emissions. The dining
room saw a median time lag of two minutes, while the living room and first floor bathroom saw
median time lags of four minutes. As a reminder, the time resolution of the PurpleAir instruments

19

used in this study is two minutes. The short lag experienced in the bathroom is explained by the
fact that the HRV exhaust is located in that space, resulting in a strong impact of the HRV
airflows on the indoor contaminant transport for that zone. Of all the sensors on the first floor,
the bedroom saw the longest time lag, with a median lag time of five minutes. This sensor was
the farthest from the cooking area. This suggests that the airflow pattern to this location took a
path correlating to the pathway distance. The particles were transported to the second floor more
quickly than what would be expected by following an airflow pathway through doors and stairs.
The median time lag for the east bedroom, main bedroom, and the west bedroom were 5.5, 9, and
7 min respectively. The second-floor bathroom and stairwell saw the longest time lags among the
second-floor sensors, with median time lags of 10 and 10.5 minutes; the stairwell transport likely
followed a non-direct airflow pathway or was impacted by thermal stratification. The basement
sensor experienced the longest time delay between all the in-house sensors with a median time
lag of 22 min. The attic saw none to minimal increase in particulate matter concentration and
seemed to be largely unaffected by indoor sources. The attic is only connected to the rest of the
house via short passive ducts and air leakage in the attic floor.
The PM concentration decreasing as particles travel through the house is consistent with what
was expected considering the time lags between each sensor and the source. The first-floor
sensors observed about half of PM2.5 concentrations observed in the kitchen. Next, the second
floor as well as the basement sensors observed about half of the PM 2.5 concentrations observed
on the first floor. The living room, dining room, and first floor bathroom sensors all experienced
the shortest time lags, and subsequently the smallest reduction in concentration from the source.
Their median peak magnitude with respect to the source were 44 %, 49 %, and 53 %,
respectively. The first-floor bedroom experienced the smallest concentration fraction (33 %)
from all sensors on the first floor.
Floor-to-floor transport of cooking emissions appears to homogenize PM2.5 concentrations and
time lags across all second-floor sensors. The median second-floor peak magnitude with respect
to the source ranged from 15 % to 19 %. This indicates that, despite the high indoor recirculation
rate in this house that is promoted by the continuously running HVAC system, the majority of
emitted particles from a given cooking event might initially disperse through the first floor, then

are evenly transported to the second floor. The HVAC system was outfitted with a MERV 8 filter,
which is known to have a > 20 % efficiency for particles < 3 m in size.

3.3. Modeling PM2.5 transport
3.3.1. Approach #1: Multi-box model
The multi-box model was used to estimate particle concentration increases throughout the house
from a kitchen source. The time series results for this modeling approach can be seen in Figure
S14. The box model underpredicted concentration peaks (by 46 %, on average) but worked
reasonably for predicting average, time-integrated concentrations for each cooking period, as
discussed below. Because multiple PurpleAir sensors were offline during CE3 and CE6, those
were omitted from analysis. A comparison of experimental measurements and modeled results is
shown in Figure 6, with additional information on Figure S14 and Table S12.

Figure 6. (a) Measured and box model PM2.5 concentrations for all cooking events. (b) timeintegrated measured and box model PM2.5 concentrations for the first floor, second floor, and
basement of the test house (n = 18). The fit for the first and second floor combined data yielded a
slope of 0.79, an R2 = 0.82, and RMSE = 9.4 g m-3. The linear fit for the basement yielded a
slope of 0.40, an R2 = 0.72, and RMSE = 6.9 g m-3.
The box model did not capture the temporal behavior of the observed concentrations, resulting in
the arcing patterns observed in the data in Figure 6a, also seen in the time series shown in Figure
S14. However, the box model performed well in predicting time-integrated PM2.5 concentrations
on the first and second floors (with an average difference of -1 % compared to experimental
values, Table S12). Integrated PM2.5 concentrations were underestimated by 46 % on the

basement level. This is likely because this model assumes a uniform concentration in each zone
and may not adequately capture air movement between zones. In reality, localized flows are
likely to enhance PM transport throughout the house. Fabian and Levy [30] investigated the use
of a single-box model and CONTAM to predict PM2.5 concentrations in a multi-family building
and found that the box model was not capable of capturing important dynamics in these cases.
They also found that CONTAM performed better than the box model. Dhiman et al. [31]
examined PM transport between two zones in a dining facility and found that differences in ACR
during different meals accounted for the variability in indoor PM transport.
3.3.2. Approach #2: Empirical model
We adapted an empirical model (Eq. 4) to recreate a time series of PM2.5 concentrations in 10
locations throughout the test house where measurements were also made by PurpleAir sensors.
The values for coefficients a, b, and c for the different approaches to measure distances on the
second floor are listed in Table 3. The model performed slightly better to predict concentrations
on the first floor (R2 = 0.90) compared to the second floor (R2 = 0.82 to 0.86).

Due to the observed homogenization between the sensors’ lag time and concentration decay for
the second floor, Method 2 performed best to account for floor-to-floor transport of PM2.5. In
Method 2, for the first floor, the distances used were direct lines, ignoring any physical barriers
(ranging from 4.29 to 8.10 m). For the second floor using Method 2, the distances used were a
direct vertical line to a point above the kitchen for all sensors (4.39 m).
The robustness of Method 2 was then evaluated by omitting one cooking event at a time as a
training dataset and then testing it on the remaining cooking event dataset. Results from this
analysis are shown in Table S13 and Figure S15. The training and testing analysis resulted in
similar average a, b, and c coefficients (-0.007, 0.914, and 0.683 respectively).
Ambient PM penetration indoors had a negligible effect in indoor PM concentrations during
cooking periods (as evidenced by a coefficient of -0.006). When evaluating the ambient PM
model separately, in three instances of high ambient PM2.5 concentrations (Figure S15) and no
indoor PM sources, the average linear regression slope was 0.104, with an average lag time of 61
min. This demonstrates that about 10 % of ambient PM2.5 concentrations were observed indoors
about 1 h later. The ambient PM term was ignored in subsequent analyses. The resulting equation
for the empirical model (Method 2b) during cooking periods, ignoring ambient PM penetration,
is shown in Eq. 5.

A comparison between modeled and experimental PM2.5 concentrations and integrated
concentrations, using the empirical model (Method 2b), are presented in Figure 7, with additional
model results shown in Figure S16. When integrating PM2.5 concentrations over each cooking
period, the model performance was similar between the first and the second floors. Compared to
the box model, the time integrated concentrations were more accurate (slope closer to 1), but less
precise (lower R2 and higher RMSE).

3.3.3. Approach #3: CONTAM model
The updated CONTAM model of the NZERTF was able to capture both the peak concentrations
of PM2.5 as well as the particle concentration decay using the peak concentration data in the
dining room and building parameters (zone temperatures, wind, HVAC and HRV airflows) as
inputs (

Figure 8). As with the previous two models, the measured particle concentration data was
compared to the modeled particle concentration data for each cooking event. As seen in

Figure 8a), the first-floor particle concentrations (blue dots) were higher than the second-floor
particle concentrations (yellow dots) and are shown against a 1:1 relationship line (perfect
agreement). The data showing consistent trends away from the 1:1 line are from situations when
a constant emission source did not represent the varying cooking emission data (e.g. CE1 in
Figure S17).
The time-integrated PM concentrations in each zone were calculated for both the measured and
modeled particle concentration data of the first and second floors over the course of an hour after
the start of the cooking event. A majority of the differences were likely the result of the
assumption of constant particle generation rate while cooking. For the first and second floor,
time integrated concentrations using the CONTAM model results were less accurate relative to
the measurements than using the empirical model, but more accurate than the box model. Due to
the constant emission source assumption the CONTAM model was less precise than either of the
other two models.

from the time-integrated analysis.

3.4. Indoor microenvironmental PM2.5 exposures
Using an realistic activity pattern in which a person spends 16.5 hours per day at home, the PM2.5
exposure and average PM2.5 concentrations for five locations throughout the house are presented
in Figure 9. Detailed results for this analysis are presented in Table S14 and Table S15.

Average PM2.5 concentrations ranged between 3 µg m-3 and 32 µg m-3 for quantified indoor
microenvironments (locations of sensors), with the highest value in the kitchen (during
mealtimes) and the lowest in the bedroom (during nighttime). This would lead to a 16.5-hr
average concentration of 7 µg m-3. Although not encompassing the entire day, this value is below
other studies that have reported 24-hr average home PM2.5 concentrations (around 28 µg m-3 to
47 µg m-3 [32]).
Of the total PM2.5 exposure in the home, 54 % originated from indoor cooking and the remaining
46 % resulted from outdoor PM2.5 infiltration into the house. This result agrees with Lunderberg
et al., who estimated PM2.5 infiltration factors in approximately 4,000 US homes and determined
that about half of indoor PM2.5 originates from indoor sources [33].
The PM2.5 exposures in the different microenvironments ranged between 3 µg m-3 h and 48 µg
m-3 h. The total summed exposure over the 16.5-hour duration at home would be 109 µg m-3 h.
The highest exposure was observed during the cooking periods. Although the kitchen / dining
area only accounted for 9 % of the time spent at home, it corresponded to 44 % of the PM2.5
exposure (48 µg m-3 h) due to relatively high PM2.5 concentrations (≈32 µg m-3). The second
highest exposure location was in the bedroom, responsible for 61 % of the time at home at a low
PM2.5 concentration (3 µg m-3). These results agree with other studies that suggest that the
highest PM exposure in the home occur in the kitchen [34] and in the bedroom [35].

4. Conclusions
By taking advantage of the accessibility of low-cost sensors, we investigated particle transport
from cooking emissions throughout a 4-level house. We have shown that, when the HVAC fan is
on, emissions are transported relatively quickly throughout the main spaces of the house, within
~5 min to the first floor and within ~10 min to the second floor. Cooking emissions reached the
basement after ~22 min and they did not reach the attic at measurable concentrations. During
indoor transport, particle concentrations decrease due to dilution with indoor air, deposition to
surfaces, and losses to the outdoor environment. Compared to peak PM2.5 concentrations
observed in the kitchen, the remaining areas on the first floor observed roughly half of those
magnitudes, which dropped by roughly half again when reaching the second floor.

We used three modeling approaches to describe particle transport throughout the house, with
different input requirements: a multi-box model, an empirical model, and the CONTAM
multizone model. While the box model reasonably predicted time integrated PM2.5
concentrations in the first and second floors of the house, several assumptions had to be made,
especially related to internal airflows and box volumes. The empirical model performed similarly
but required space-resolved, concurrent measurements throughout the house to develop it, which
is not always feasible. The CONTAM model predicted the particle decays adequately using only
the peak concentration in the dining room for each event and building parameters as an input, but
required a detailed house model, tuning with CO2 tracer testing, and the assumption of constant
particle production during cooking.
All models successfully predicted time integrated PM 2.5 concentrations on the 1st and 2nd floors,
with R2 between 0.57 and 0.82 and RMSE from 6 to 11 µg m-3. All models, especially the box
model and CONTAM, underpredicted PM2.5 concentrations more severely during air fryer
experiments compared to pan frying. This was likely because air fryer experiments led to a
single, sharp peak of emissions and these models outputted a more gradual increase and decrease
in concentrations due to assumptions of uniform concentration within each zone. The method
used for quantifying the PM2.5 source (i.e., concentration in the kitchen vs average from the
kitchen-dining area vs mass-emission rates) had strong influence on the results for all models.
While all models outputted time-resolved particle concentrations, spatial resolution varied. The
empirical model and the CONTAM model were able to estimate particle concentrations at
specific point locations within the house, while the box model was only able to predict average
concentrations for certain zones in the house. Although the box model is more limited than the
other two investigated modeling approaches, its inputs were significantly easier to obtain and its
output may be sufficient to provide information for making decisions based on overall PM2.5
concentrations indoors, e.g., where to place a portable air cleaner to reduce occupant exposure.
With more detailed airflow information, box models can be further divided into more zones and
thus approximate the capabilities of CONTAM.
One limitation of this study is in how this test house compares to an average home in the United
States. Due to the design goal of the NZERTF, the test house operated at a low ACR. While this

allowed for a long residence time of emitted species, it also limits the interaction between the
indoor and outdoor air. This may not currently be representative of the average US house, but it
could become so as more houses strive for energy efficiency and tighten their building envelope.
Additionally, due to the experimental design of CASA, the HVAC system operated continuously,
while most residential units run less than 20 % of the time [36]. This likely enhanced internal
mixing in this work compared to the average home. Another limitation is the operation principle
of the low-cost sensors and their inherent measurement uncertainty, which is likely to be greater
than with reference instruments, even after data corrections as those performed in this study.
Both the understanding and prediction of PM2.5 concentrations throughout a house can help
identify trends and aid in better prevention and mitigation techniques. While indoor sources of
PM are not constrained to just cooking, the results of this work might be applicable to other
indoor point sources such as candles, incense, and office products such as printers [37].
