ABSTRACT: Saturn’s moon Titan features a surface composed of various organic solids with pronounced compositional and structural diversity. On top of the icy core, the surface experiences temperature of ~93 K and pressure of ~1.45 atm. Under these conditions,
most small organic molecules exist as solids and form Titanean minerals. Acetonitrile and acetylene are two of these molecules,
which can form single-component molecular solids, but also a 1:2 binary cocrystal. Here we present a combined neutron vibrational
spectroscopic study, neutron powder diffraction study, and theoretical modeling of the cocrystal and the corresponding single-phase
solids. This combined study resulted in insightful spectra–structure–properties correlations for the cocrystal and the molecular solids.
Furthermore, we observed quenching of the high-temperature form of acetonitrile in the presence of the cocrystal, which supports the
possibility of the existence of metastable solids as minerals on Titan. The results presented in this study further the knowledge of the
putative structure and composition of the surface of Titan, and, at the same time, contributes to better understanding of the fundamental thermodynamic properties of two of the smallest organic molecules in the Universe.

organic environment is believed to be conducive to life, which
has been hypothesized to be methanogenic in nature.8
Expectedly, Titan remains in the center of the scientific interest,
in 2019, NASA announced a New Frontiers mission to Titan.9
The Dragonfly rotorcraft is planned to launch in 2026/27, and it
is expected to arrive on Titan in 2034. During its 2.7-year baseline mission, the rotorcraft will explore various sites on Titan,
searching for signatures of extinct, extant, or future life. Before
to this imminent mission, laboratory studies directed towards
predicting, modelling, and recreating the surface mineralogy of
the moon can greatly further our understanding of the surface
of Titan.
The target molecules of this study, acetonitrile and acetylene,
have been detected in the upper atmosphere by Voyager 1,6 and
by the subsequent (and more comprehensive) Cassini-Huygens
mission using the Cassini composite infrared spectrometer
(CIRS),10gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS),11 and
ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS),12 among others.
These molecules are produced in the atmosphere and on the surface of Titan by various radical and ion facilitated reactions.1012
Carried by methane rainfall, they descent to the surface with
high precipitation rates, together with many other organic molecules. Considering a scenario in which the precipitation of organic matter occurs for over 4 billion years (the age of Titan),
the accumulated surface layer of organic crystals would reach

INTRODUCTION
Acetonitrile and acetylene are two of the smallest organic molecules and important commodity chemicals on Earth, with
prominent industrial relevance as solvents and fuels. These
molecules are also naturally found on other celestial bodies
where they play different roles. While under Earth’s ambient
conditions, acetonitrile and acetylene are in liquid and gaseous
states, respectively, on planetary environments featuring lower
temperatures and/or higher pressures, these molecules exist in a
solid state and form minerals.
Titan, Saturn’s icy moon, is one such environment, with ambient conditions on the surface of ~93 K and ~1.45 bar. he recently concluded Cassini-Huygens mission (1997–2017) revealed that Titan possesses a dense and chemically active atmosphere composed mainly of dinitrogen and methane, ethane
based lakes and seas on the poles, and sandy dunes on the equator.1-5 Fuelled by radiation from the Sun and Saturn’s magnetosphere, dinitrogen and methane react to produce various organic
molecules,3-4 including acetonitrile and acetylene, which are
then carried by methane rainfall and vigorous storms6 to the surface, where they dissolve in the lakes. A seasonal cycling of
evaporation and precipitation of methane, a process notably like
Earth’s hydrological cycle, produces evaporite lakebeds and
mineral deposits made of organic molecules.7 This dynamic

up to several meters thickness.4 This organic, solid-state layer
is believed to feature a pronounced chemical and structural
complexity and a unique mineralogical makeup.4, 13
Such organic minerals, including acetonitrile and acetylene, can
exist as single-phase molecular crystals, but also as cocrystals,
solvates, hydrates, clathrates, and other forms. Both acetonitrile14 and acetylene15 have two polymorphs, a high- and lowtemperature phases. The low temperature phases for these components are orthorhombic (α-phase) acetonitrile and (αphase) orthorhombic acetylene, and their high temperature
phases are monoclinic (β-phase) acetonitrile and cubic (βphase) acetylene.14-15 Additionally, both compounds form cocrystals with different co-components.16 Recently, these cocrystals have attracted the interest of the research community as putative minerals on Titan. Some examples include the studies of
acetylene and butane;17 a ternary cocrystal of benzene, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide;18 acetylene and ammonia;19-21 acetonitrile and benzene22 and others. Acetonitrile and acetylene
also form cocrystal stable at the conditions of Titan. This cocrystal has been studied with various experimental techniques:
The crystal structure was solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction, described in the Cmc21 space group and with a 1:2 acetonitrile:acetylene stoichiometry.21 The spectroscopic properties of
the cocrystal have been studied by Raman spectroscopy revealing characteristic shifts of the vibrational bands as a function of
cocrystallization.23
We have an on-going effort to expand the understanding of the
vibrational structure of putative Titanean minerals using neutron vibrational spectroscopy (NVS). NVS is a far more comprehensive technique for examining the vibrational structure of
materials, as compared to other symmetry-depended vibrational
methods such as IR and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore,
NVS uses neutron particles as probes, which interact with the
atomic nuclei of the material leading to particle–particle interactions, as opposed to the phonon–electron could interactions
in optical measurements. These particle–particle interactions
are particularly strong for H/D atoms, making the method extremely suitable for studies of hydrogen-rich materials, including hydrocarbons.16 At the same time, particle–particle interactions can be more accurately modeled and explained by theoretical calculations, proving us an opportunity to accurately simulate, assign, and understand the spectra. Finally, NVS can also
access vibrational modes in the low-frequency phonon range
which is most relevant for studies of the extended structure of
solids.16
Here we report a combined NVS and neutron diffraction study
of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) cocrystal. To confirm that the
NVS data have been collected from the target solid, we have
simultaneously collected and analyzed Time-of-Flight neutron
powder diffraction (TOF-NPD) data. We have observed sharp
and well-resolved vibrational modes from the cocrystal, which
were modeled and assigned using density functional theory
(DFT) methods. In our data, we have observed that the cocrystal
concurrently exists in a phase mixture with solid acetonitrile.
Surprisingly, acetonitrile does not adopt the thermodynamically
stable orthorhombic form at low-temperature and rather forms
the high-temperature monoclinic form by kinetic quenching.
This prompted us to examine the low-frequency phonon modes
of both forms of acetonitrile, revealing stark differences between both polymorphs. The combined spectroscopic, diffraction, and theoretical results provide relevant insights into the

composition, structure, and properties of solid organic materials, expected to exist as minerals on Titan.
EXPERIMENTAL
Neutron Vibrational Spectroscopy. Data collection was performed on VISION (BL-16B) the neutron vibrational spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.24 The cocrystal was synthesized in situ by
condensing gaseous acetylene onto a solid acetonitrile crystal at
77 K. The vessel was then slowly cooled to 5 K over 3 hrs before data was collected. Measurements of NVS and TOF-NPD
were collected in tandem at (5, 50, 75, 93, 125, 150, 175, and
235 K) with one-hour thermal equilibrations allowed between
steps. Upon reaching 235 K, the samples were allowed to
slowly cool back to 5 K under the same increments and NVS
and TOF-NPD data were collected.
Time-of-Flight Neutron Powder Diffraction (TOF-NPD).
Data collection was performed on VISION (BL-16B) the neutron vibrational spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source
(SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. NVS measurements
and TOF-NPD patterns were collected in tandem. TOF-NPD
data were analyzed using the GSAS-II software package.26 The
molecular components and cocrystal space groups and lattice
parameters were taken from the literature and found to be Aeam
for orthorhombic acetylene,14 Cmc21 for β-acetonitrile,15 and
Cmc21 for the acetonitrile:acetylene cocrystal.21 Precise lattice
parameters, peak shapes, and background function were determined by Pawley refinement was performed on the TOF-NPD
patterns to derive specific lattice parameters, background function, and peak shape parameters.26
Computational Studies. Density Functional Theory (DFT)
modeling was performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package (VASP).27 The Projector Augmented Wave (PAW)
method was used for these calculations 28-30 The energy cutoff
was 800 eV for the plane-wave basis of the valence electrons.
The total energy tolerance for was 10-8 eV for electronic energy
minimization and was 10-7 eV for structure optimization. The
maximum interatomic force after relaxation was below 0.002
eV/Å. The lattice parameters and atomic coordinates for the
structures reported in the literature served as a starting point for
this work. The optB86b-vdW functional31 was used for dispersion corrections. The vibrational eigenfrequencies and modes
were then calculated by solving the force constants and dynamical matrix using Phonopy.32 The FT-calculated phonon results
were converted to the simulated INS spectra using the OCLIMAX software package.33
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) cocrystal was prepared in-situ
at VISION, the neutron vibrational spectrometer at the SNS at
ORNL. Liquid acetonitrile and gaseous acetylene were
quenched from room temperature to 5 K. To confirm the structure and composition of the resulting solid, TOF-NPD was collected in tandem with the NVS measurements. Figure 1 highlights the diffraction patterns collected at various temperatures.
While fast cooling of the mixture resulted in measurable quantities of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2), heating of the sample
has showed inconsistency of the composition, with varying
amounts of the cocrystal and the corresponding single-phase
components. We hypothesize that the culprit for this behavior
is improper mixing due to the large disparity between the freezing point of acetylene (189 K) and the relatively high freezing

point of acetonitrile (228 K). Improper mixing can result to partial conversion of the single phases to the cocrystal, and the content of such sample can move within the canister upon heating,
exposing different parts of the sample in the path of the beam.
Cyclic thermal treatment (heating/cooling) of such system can
lead to better mixing and homogenization of the sample. In fact,
heating to 235 K, and subsequently slowly cooling to 5 K, resulted in compositionally consistent sample.
Analysis of the TOF-NPD patterns collected at 5 K clearly
shows the formation of the targeted acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2)
cocrystal. The structure of the cocrystal has been previously
solved and described in the Cmc21 space group.21 We used the
(0 2 1) and (3 1 0) reflections as indicators for the synthesis of

the target cocrystal. Indeed, these reflections are clearly present
in the patterns at 1.73 and 1.77 Å-1 respectively (Figure 1).
Cooling/heating of this compositionally consistent sample
showed the expected gradual shift of the scattered intensity as a
function of temperature, consistent with the thermal expansion
properties of each solid.
The cocrystal is expected to be the thermodynamically most stable phase for this mixture at low temperature and ambient pressure, however due to experimental limitations (including challenges with improper mixing of the reactants and finite time for
reactivity/cocrystallization) the reactants are also present in the
sample. Reflections form phase pure acetonitrile and acetylene
were detected and are visible in the the full range of the TOFNPD pattern and its respective Pawley fit at T = 5 K (Figure 2).
We suspect that the interface between the acetonitrile solid and
the acetylene condensate is where the majority of the cocrystal
is localized. This is consistent with other literature reports for
some of our previously reported cocrystals, as well as others in
the literature.16-22
Acetonitrile14 and acetylene15 have two polymorphs, a high- and
low-temperature phases. Interestingly, the crystallographic
analysis of the pattern collected at 5 K (Figure 2) revealed that
the sample is composed of the cocrystal, the low temperature
form of acetylene, and, rather surprisingly, the high-temperature, β-phase of acetonitrile. It has been reported that rapid
cooling of acetonitrile can result in a phase trapping of the hightemperature polymorph at low temperature.34 Here we show
that similar quenching can also occur depending on the phase
composition. This observation further supports the hypothesis
that metastable phases of organic materials can be viable mineral species on Titan. The putative presence of metastable minerals on this moon is yet another parallel with the mineralogy
on Earth, where metastable minerals are often found in various
locations and environments. For example, cristobalite (the
quenched high-temperature form of silica, SiO2) serves as an
analogous case of a metastable mineral found in acidic volcanic
rocks.

Figure 3. Variable Temperature NVS spectra overlay of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) cocrystal mixture with peak assignments.
The vibrational spectra were collected in tandem with diffraction
patterns upon heating up from the crash-cooled sample at 5 K. Exact ranges for assigned peaks can be found in Table 1.

The cocrystal was next studied with NVS. Spectra of the compositionally consistent sample were collected as a function of
temperature (Figure 3), in tandem with the TOF-NPD patterns
(Figure 1). The NVS signal typically exhibits strong thermal
dependence, where peak intensity is inversely related to thermal
motion. This is particularly prominent for organic molecular
species devoid of strong intermolecular bonding within the
crystal packing. Expectedly, the collected spectra show gradual
sharpening of the peaks, with the best data set collected at 5 K.
Figure 4 presents the NVS spectrum of the sample measured at
5 K, together with NVS of the pure component solids. The experimentally collected NVS spectra of acetylene35 and β-acetonitrile36 were taken from literature data. In agreement with the
TOF-NPD data, the measured spectrum shows a mixture of
three phases, the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) cocrystal, the hightemperature phase of acetonitrile, and the low-temperature
phase of acetylene.
The NVS further confirmed the quenching of the high-temperature phase of acetonitrile. We have calculated the NVS spectra
of both phases, shown in Figure 5. The CH3 rotational libration
I mode was found to be a defining feature for the two polymorphs. In the α-phase, this vibrational mode is expected to
have a signal at 20 meV (161 cm-1), whereas in the β-phase
at 25 meV (202 cm-1). The NVS spectrum of the cocrystal features a strong vibrational band at 25 meV (200 cm-1) with no

clear vibrational modes associated exclusively with the lowtemperature α-acetonitrile phase. The theoretical calculations, and the TOF-NPD analysis, confirm that the excess acetonitrile contributing to the intensities in the experimental
NVS originates from the kinetically trapped, high temperature β-acetonitrile polymorph.34
The NVS spectrum of the cocrystal was simulated (Figure 6)
using DFT calculations performed on the published21 Cmc21
crystal structure as a starting model. Generally, there is a good
agreement between the computationally predicted spectra and
the experiment. The overall profile of the predicted spectra
matches well with the experimental spectrum, which enables us
to confidently assign the peaks to the corresponding vibrational
modes. Table 1 presents selected peak assignments.
Analyzing the energy of vibrational modes in the cocrystal compared to single-component solids presents a valuable avenue for
establishing spectra-structure-properties correlations. Figure 4
highlights the crystal structures of the phase-pure components,
orthorhombic acetylene and monoclinic β-acetonitrile, and the
crystal structure of the cocrystal.15
The molecules in the cocrystal show several colossal vibrational
shifts compared to the individual components. Most notably,
the rotational librational mode of the acetonitrile CH3 group in
the cocrystal shows a massive red shift compared to the same
vibration in pure β-acetonitrile. In the molecular β-acetonitrile,

In a recent study of the NVS characteristic of the acetylene:ammonia (1:1) cocrystal, we have identified a possible correlation
between the plastic crystal (rotor phase) behavior of the cocrystal and the colossal shift of the NH3 rotational libration mode in
the cocrystal compared to phase-pure ammonia.19 Based on the
colossal red shift of 22.5 meV (181 cm-1) observed in the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) cocrystal, we hypothesized that this
solid may exhibit plastic crystal behavior. In fact, during the final stages of the preparation of this paper, molecular dynamics
simulations were published,38 further confirming the plastic nature of the cocrystal.

the energy transfer associated with exciting this mode was determined to be 25 meV (202 cm-1), whereas in the cocrystal the
energy transfer was 2.5 meV (20 cm-1), resulting in a red shift
of 22.5 meV (181 cm-1).
This colossal shift can be rationalized considering the differences in the local environment of the acetonitrile molecules in
both crystal packings. In the β-acetonitrile phase, acetonitrile
molecules form chains with hydrogen bonding interactions between the nitrogen of one acetonitrile atom and the adjacent H
from the CH3 groups on a neighboring molecular. The hydrogen
bond is of moderate strength, as indicated by the C-H···N bond
distance of 3.11(6) Ǻ (Figure 7). In the acetonitrile:acetylene
(1:2) cocrystal, acetonitrile molecules are surrounded by acetylene molecules, forming hydrogen bonding interactions between the acetylene C-H as bond donors and the nitrogen atoms
of the acetonitrile as bond acceptors. There are two crystallographically distinct C-H···N interactions between acetonitrile
and acetylene, one with a C-H···N distance of 2.63(3) Ǻ and a
slightly weaker interaction of 3.01(3) Ǻ. Due to crystal symmetry, each acetonitrile molecule is surrounded by four
acetylene molecules (Figure 7). At the same time, the methyl
group does not engage in prominent hydrogen bonding,
thus is free to rotate. Expectedly, crystallographic analysis
of the cocrystal indicates towards disorder of the hydrogen
atoms.
Furthermore, the related CH3CH rocking libration shows a
visible (yet comparably smaller) red shift, where in the molecular β-acetonitrile the energy of the vibration is 48 meV (387
cm-1) and in the cocrystal it was found to be 44 meV (354 cm1
). This red shift is likely caused by the same structural differences causing the red shift of the rotational librational mode.

CONCLUSIONS
We have provided a detailed NVS study coupled and supported
with TOF-NPD analysis of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) cocrystal, a potential organic mineral relevant to the surface geology of Titan and other celestial bodies.
Our efforts to synthetize the cocrystal by co-condensation of
liquid acetonitrile and acetylene resulted in mixed phase system, which composition heavily depended on the experimental
conditions. The temperature-resolved TOF-NPD analyses further confirm the importance of thermal cycling in for the synthesis of organic cocrystals at cryogenic conditions. Regardless
of our best efforts, the sample still contained solid phases of the
reactants. Interestingly, we identified that the high-temperature
form of acetonitrile is quantically quenched in the presence of
acetylene. This composition-dependent quenching of molecular
solids indicates towards the possibility of metastable minerals
on Titan.
The temperature-resolved NVS showed pronounced influence
of the thermal motion of the molecules on the observed spectral
resolution. Well-resolved spectra were obtained at lower temperature and the analysis was done on the spectrum collected at
5 K. The cocrystal shows distinct spectral features, clearly visible in the experimentally obtained NVS spectrum. Detailed
theoretical analysis enabled us to assign vibrational modes to
the corresponding NVS peaks.
Analyzing the energy of vibrational modes in the cocrystal compared to single-component solids allowed us to draw spectrastructure-properties correlations. These correlations deepen our
understanding of how the local crystalline environment influences vibrational energy levels. Most notably, we observed a
massive red-shift of 22.5 meV (181 cm-1) of the CH3 rotational
libration in the cocrystal. The observation of this vibration at
much lower energy than pure acetonitrile is attributed to a less
tightly packed environment surrounding the pendant methyl
groups and the unique hydrogen bonding in the cocrystal structure. In the cocrystal, the methyl group is devoid of strong hydrogen bonding to neighboring acetonitrile molecules, facilitating molecular dynamics. Based on this colossal red shift, we
hypothesize plastic phase behavior of the solid.
This study shows the intricate and complicated structure, composition, and properties of small organic molecules at cryogenic
conditions. In light of their relevance as minerals on Titan and
other celestial bodies, further theoretical and experimental studies are necessary to better understand their nature.
