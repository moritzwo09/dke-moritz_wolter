Abstract
Currently, less than 1% of rare earth elements (REEs) are recycled due to the limitations of conventional
recycling methods. Waste streams containing NdFeB magnets, such as household appliances,
industrial motors, electric vehicle (EV) motors, and consumer electronics, are typically processed using
traditional recycling techniques. These methods often involve shredding the material and applying
separation techniques like magnetic and eddy current separation, which are designed to recover
materials such as copper, iron, aluminum, plastic, and precious metals. However, they do not
e ectively recover REEs. Studies have shown that the ferrous fraction from typical recycling facilities for
ferrous waste contains a REEs concentration which is too low to be economically viable for REE
recovery.
This creates a pressing need of designing recycling processes able to valorize the REEs fraction. A
critical step in these processes is the demagnetization of NdFeB magnets, without which their e icient
separation from the waste stream would not be feasible. Demagnetization is necessary when
processing waste through mechanical shredding and separation to prevent the strong magnetism of
NdFeB magnets from causing operational issues. Issues such as the formation of “meatballs” (clusters
of magnetic material) and magnets sticking to ferromagnetic parts of machinery are common when
magnets remain magnetized. Moreover, demagnetization facilitates the separation of magnets from
non-ferromagnetic fractions in the waste stream.
Demagnetization can be achieved using di erent techniques. One approach is hydrogen decrepitation,
where hydrogen is absorbed by the NdFeB magnet, leading to brittle hydride formation that breaks down
the magnet into a ﬁne powder, which simultaneously induces demagnetization. Alternatively, thermal
treatment can be used to raise the temperature of the magnets above their Curie temperature, at which
point they lose their magnetic properties.
This study focused on the thermal demagnetization of NdFeB magnets contained within electric motors.
Using an experimental design approach, we developed demagnetization curves that correlate the
degree of demagnetization with key parameters such as temperature and treatment duration. The study
also examined potential di erences in demagnetization behavior when magnets were treated as part of
an assembled motor versus individually. NdFeB magnets were subjected to varying temperatures and
time intervals to generate these demagnetization curves, providing insights into the behavior of both
individual magnets and those integrated within motor assemblies. Notably, it was observed that the
average degree of demagnetization achieved varied depending on whether magnets were treated within
the rotor or individually. This suggests that the assembly within the rotor a ects the demagnetization
response, resulting in a slower demagnetization process.

The experimental design (DOE) method enabled the development of a predictive model that estimates
the degree of demagnetization based on time and temperature parameters. Results indicated that the
coe icient for temperature (T) in the model consistently exerted a stronger inﬂuence on
demagnetization than the coe icient for time (t), suggesting that temperature has a greater impact on
demagnetization process.

1. Introduction
Currently, less than 1% of rare earth elements (REEs) are recycled (Jowitt et al., 2018), largely due to the
limitations of conventional recycling processes. Waste containing NdFeB magnets, such as household
appliance, industrial motors, electric motors of electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, are
typically treated using traditional recycling methods, which involve shredding the material and applying
mechanical separation techniques such as magnetic separation and eddy current separation. These
methods are primarily designed to recover materials like copper, iron, aluminum, plastic, and precious
metals, but they do not e ectively recover REEs. As demonstrated by Bandara et al., the ferrous fraction
from a typical ferrous waste recycling plant contains around 100-200 ppm of neodymium (Nd), which is
a concentration too low to be economically viable for recovery.
The challenge, therefore, is to design a recycling process speciﬁcally targeted at recovering the REEs
fraction. A critical component of this process is the demagnetization of NdFeB magnets, without which
their separation from the waste stream would not be feasible. Demagnetization is crucial for two main
reasons: ﬁrst, in processes where waste is dismantled to extract the magnets, demagnetization is
required to allow for e icient separation; second, in cases where waste is processed through
mechanical shredding and separation, demagnetization is essential to prevent the strong magnetism of
NdFeB magnets from causing operational issues, such as the formation of "meatballs" (clusters of
magnetic material) and the magnets sticking to ferromagnetic parts of the machinery. Furthermore,
demagnetization allows the magnetic fraction to be separated from the ferrous fraction in the waste
stream (Coelho et al., 2021).
Demagnetization can be achieved through di erent methods. One approach is hydrogen decrepitation
(Walton et al., 2015) (Jönsson et al., 2020) which involves the absorption of hydrogen into the NdFeB
magnet, leading to the formation of brittle hydrides that cause the magnet to break down into a ﬁne
powder. This process simultaneously induces demagnetization. Alternatively, thermal treatment can be
used to raise the temperature of the magnets above their Curie temperature, at which point they lose
their magnetic properties (K&J Magnetics., 2024).
In this study, we focused on the thermal demagnetization of NdFeB magnets contained within electric
scooter motors. Using an experimental design approach, we generated demagnetization curves that
correlate the degree of demagnetization with key parameters such as temperature and treatment time.
Additionally, the study investigated whether there are di erences in the demagnetization behavior of
magnets when treated as part of the assembled motor versus when treated individually.
The ﬁndings of this study provide insights into optimizing the demagnetization process for e icient
recycling of NdFeB magnets, ensuring that the REEs content can be e ectively recovered and reused,
supporting a more sustainable approach to the lifecycle of REEs in electric mobility and other
industries.

2. Materials and instruments
The motors used for the demagnetization tests were sourced from end-of-life electric scooters from the
same company (see Figure 1), making them identical in both structure and appearance.

Figure 1: The pictures shows the electric motor used for the study.

The magnets inside these motors all have identical dimensions: 3.3 cm in height, 1.2 cm in width, and
0.3 cm in depth, corresponding to a mass of approximately 9 grams (see Figure 2).

To measure the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the permanent magnets in the electric scooter motors, a
PCE-MFM 3000 Magnetic Field Meter (Gaussmeter) produced by PCE Americas Inc. was used (see Fig.
3).

3 Experimental procedure
3.1 Motor Disassembly and Magnet Removal
The motors were ﬁrst disassembled to access the magnets. The screws holding the two sections of the
rotor were removed, and a puller was used to separate the rotor from the stator. Fig. 5 illustrates the
process of rotor-stator separation using the puller.

Each motor contains 30 permanent magnets of identical size. To remove these magnets from the rotor,
one was deliberately broken using a chisel. This allowed the rest of the magnets to be extracted one by
one using a ﬁne-tipped spatula.

3.2 Initial Magnetic Field Measurements
Magnetic ﬁeld measurements were taken for each of the 29 remaining magnets (per motor) at ﬁve
distinct points on both the north and south faces. This method was adopted due to the signiﬁcant
variation in magnetic ﬁeld strength depending on the measurement location (stronger at the edges), and
the susceptibility of di erent regions of the magnets to demagnetization post-thermal treatment.
The measurement points for each magnet are as follows:


C2: 0.6 cm from the left side, 0.3 cm from the bottom.



C3: 1 cm from the left side, 1.65 cm from the bottom.



C4: 0.9 cm from the left side, 0.825 cm from the bottom.

3.3 Experimental methodologies for demagnetization tests
For the following tests, 10 motors were used, identiﬁed as motors A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.
Test 1
Motors A and B were disassembled, and the magnets were removed, numbered from 1 to 29 according
to their position in the rotors. The initial magnetic field of each magnet was measured in every five points
(C1, C2, C3, C4, S1) of the north and south face. The magnets were reassembled into two hybrid rotors,
with magnets 1–14 from motor A combined with magnets 15–29 from motor B, and vice versa (see fig.
8). The purpose of creating hybrid motors was to test the variability in the behavior of magnets from
different motors during demagnetization.

Figure 8: ﬁgure shows a hybrid motor composed of 14 magnets from motor A and 15 magnets from motor B.

Both rotors were subjected to thermal treatment at 200°C for 10 minutes. Rotor A was cooled in water,
while rotor B was air-cooled. After cooling, the magnetic field of each magnet was measured again, and
the degree of demagnetization was calculated. The magnets were placed back into the rotors and
heated for an additional 25 minutes at 200°C. The cooling and measurement process was repeated. A
final treatment of 25 minutes brought the total heating time to 60 minutes. The magnetic field was
measured after each treatment to assess the effect of cooling methods on demagnetization.

Test 2
Magnets from motors C and D were removed and their initial magnetic fields were measured. The
magnets were reassembled into a hybrid rotor, as in Test 1. This rotor underwent thermal treatment at
200°C, following the same time intervals: 10, 25, and 25 minutes. The rotor was air-cooled after each
stage. The remaining magnets were treated individually, heated at the same temperature and time
intervals, and cooled with the same methodology. This test aimed to compare the demagnetization
behavior of magnets treated in bulk within the rotor versus those treated individually.
Test 3
A motor E was disassembled, and the magnets were numbered from 1 to 29. The initial magnetic field
of magnets 1 to 14 was measured, and they were then treated individually, one at a time, at 250°C. The
treatment consisted of three stages: 10 minutes initially, 25 minutes for the second stage, and another
25 minutes for the third, for a total of 60 minutes of thermal treatment, with air cooling between each
step. After each thermal treatment, the magnetic field was measured, and the degree of
demagnetization was calculated relative to the initial value.
Magnets 15 to 29 from motor E were combined with 15 magnets from another motor, F. The initial
magnetic fields of the magnets from both motor E and motor F were measured. The 29 magnets were
then placed in a rotor and thermally treated as a group at 250°C for 10 minutes in the first stage, 25
minutes in the second, and another 25 minutes in the third, for a total of 60 minutes of treatment. The
magnets were allowed to air cool between stages. After each thermal treatment, the magnetic field was
measured, and the degree of demagnetization was calculated relative to the initial value.
Finally, magnets 1 to 14 from motor F were combined with 15 magnets from a randomly selected motor
and treated under the same experimental conditions as the first group, with the only difference being
that the cooling was done in water.
The purpose of the test on motor E was to determine whether magnets assembled in a block within the
rotor exhibit significantly different demagnetization behavior compared to individually treated magnets.
The test on motor F aimed to assess whether the cooling method affects the degree of demagnetization.
Test 4
A motor G was disassembled, and the magnets were numbered from 1 to 29, with their initial magnetic
ﬁelds measured. Half of the magnets from motor G were replaced with those from another randomly
selected motor. The remaining magnets from motor G were placed in the rotor of the randomly chosen
motor. The two resulting hybrid motors were treated at two di erent temperatures, 200°C and 250°C,
respectively. The treatment durations were the same for both: 10 minutes for the ﬁrst stage, 25 minutes
for the second, and 25 minutes for the ﬁnal stage, for a total of 60 minutes. After each thermal treatment,
the magnetic ﬁelds were measured to study the behavior of the same type of magnets at di erent
temperatures, as they all originated from the same initial motor.
Motor H was also disassembled, and the magnets were numbered from 1 to 29, with their initial
magnetic ﬁelds measured. This motor was treated thermally at 300°C, following the same time intervals
used for the previous motors, and the magnetic ﬁeld was measured after each thermal treatment. At
300°C, it was observed that demagnetization was almost complete after just 10 minutes of treatment,
making the di erences in demagnetization between di erent motors negligible.
The purpose of the test was to observe how the degree of demagnetization behaves when motors are
treated at di erent temperatures.

Test 5
The magnets from motor I were split into two groups, treated individually at 200°C and 250°C. The
magnets from motor J were treated individually at 300°C. The purpose of the test was to study the
demagnetization behavior of magnets when treated individually at di erent temperatures.
This experimental setup allowed for a detailed analysis of the thermal demagnetization behavior of
NdFeB magnets under various conditions, focusing on the inﬂuence of cooling methods, treatment
time, and temperature.

3.4 Calculation of Demagnetization Degree
The degree of demagnetization was calculated as the percentage loss of the initial magnetic ﬁeld after
thermal treatment using the following formula:
𝛥𝐵% = ((𝐵𝑖 − 𝐵𝑓)/𝐵𝑖)) ∗ 100
Where:


ΔB% = Degree of demagnetization.



Bi = Initial magnetic ﬁeld, before thermal treatment.



Bf = Final magnetic ﬁeld, after thermal treatment.

3.5 Design of experiment (DOE)
To determine the contribution of time and temperature variables on the degree of demagnetization, the
collected data were used to construct a Face-Centered Design (FCD) experimental model. This model
was employed to determine the linear, quadratic, and interaction e ects of the aforementioned
variables on the degree of demagnetization. For each set of variables, 3 levels (-1, 0, +1) were chosen.
Since time and temperature are on di erent scales of measurement, the variance in minutes is not the
same as that in degrees. By using coded levels, it becomes possible to compare the two variables.
The mathematical model derived from the FCD experimental design takes the form of a linear sum of
terms such as:
𝑌 = 𝐵 +𝐵 𝑋 + 𝐵 𝑋 + 𝐵 𝑋 +𝐵 𝑋 + 𝐵 𝑋 𝑋
Where:



Y = The calculated response, which is the degree of demagnetization obtained by varying the
operational variables



B0 = Constant (intercept).



B1 = The linear coe icient for the variable X1, which represents time.



B2 = The linear coe icient for the variable X2, which represents temperature.



B11 = The coe icient for the quadratic e ect of the time variable.



B22 = The coe icient for the quadratic e ect of the temperature variable.



B12 = The coe icient for the interaction e ect between the time variable and the temperature
variable.

The table 1 provides a detailed explanation of the variables X1 and X2, indicating what each variable
represents. Additionally, it outlines the corresponding temperature and time values for each of the three
levels: -1, 0, and 1.

The advantage of the experimental design is that, with the derived model, it is possible to predict the
behavior of the degree of demagnetization by specifying the variables, time and temperature, in
advance.
The total number of experiments (N) required for constructing the experimental design was calculated
as follows:
𝑁 = 2 + 2𝑓 + 𝑁
Where:


f = Number of variables, which are time and temperature, thus equal to 2.



N0 = Number of replicates at the center point of the experimental design, which is 2.

Thus, the total number of experiments is 10.

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Test 1-inﬂuence of the cooling method at 200°C
The aim of this test was to determine whether the cooling method—instantaneous cooling in water
versus slow cooling in air—signiﬁcantly a ects the degree of demagnetization measured after thermal
treatment.
Table 2 presents the data on the degree of demagnetization of the magnets relative to the initial
measured values after treatment at 200°C for 15, 35 and 60 minutes. Table A shows the degrees of
demagnetization for the points located on the north face of the magnet, while Table B displays the
degrees of demagnetization for the points on the south face. The columns labeled "water quenching"
and "air cooling" represent the demagnetization values obtained using water and air as cooling
mediums, respectively.

Below is the legend for interpreting the table, which is consistent with the legend used for subsequent
tests:


Average ΔB%: Represents the average degree of demagnetization at the same point, calculated
for all magnets.



Dev. St.: Represents the standard deviation of the degree of demagnetization calculated for all
values at the same point across all magnets.



Rsd%: Represents the relative standard deviation, calculated as the ratio of the standard
deviation to the average value.



Median: Represents the median of the values.



Min: Represents the minimum degree of demagnetization recorded at the same point across all
magnets.



Max: Represents the maximum degree of demagnetization recorded at the same point across
all magnets.



Δ: Indicates the di erence in the degree of demagnetization between the two cooling methods
used.

The results from the ﬁrst demagnetization test revealed that, for each measurement point and
regardless of the time considered, the average degree of demagnetization with air cooling or water
quenching, along with the calculated standard deviation, overlap. Therefore, there is no signiﬁcant
di erence between the two cooling methods used. Additionally, it was observed that, for both faces of
the magnet, the ﬁnal degree of demagnetization achieved at the thermal treatment temperature of
200°C is reached after just 35 minutes of treatment. In fact, the results after 60 minutes of treatment
are the same (see Table 3).

It was also observed that the ﬁnal degree of demagnetization at points near the edges (S1, C3, C4) or
corners of the magnets is lower than that at points located in the center of the magnets (C1, C2) (see
Table 4).

4.2 Test 2- di erence between single magnets and magnets in assembly at 200°C
Table 5 presents the data on the degree of demagnetization of the magnets relative to the initial
measurements. The treatment was conducted at 200°C for 15, 35 and 60 minutes. Table A shows the
degrees of demagnetization for points located on the north face of the magnet, while Table B shows the
degrees of demagnetization for points on the south face. Columns labeled “Single” report the average
degree of demagnetization for the speciﬁed points on magnets treated and cooled individually. In
contrast, columns labeled “Bulk” present the average degree of demagnetization for the speciﬁed
points on magnets heated and cooled within the rotor.
The objective of this test is to determine whether magnets assembled in bulk within the rotor exhibit
signiﬁcantly di erent demagnetization behavior compared to magnets treated individually at a
temperature of 200°C.

Based on the results from this test, it was observed that, as in previous cases, demagnetization occurs
to a greater extent at the center of the magnets when treated within the rotor, while it is less pronounced
near the edges or sides of the magnets (see Table 6).

A signiﬁcant di erence was observed in the average degree of demagnetization between magnets
treated within the rotor and those treated individually at points S1 and C3, both on the north and south
sides, which represent the areas near the edges and sides of the magnets (see Table 7).

While this di erence in the average degree of demagnetization after 10 minutes of treatment could be
attributed to the unequal heating rates, due to the di erence in mass between the individual magnets
and the entire rotor, the same discrepancy persists even after 60 minutes of treatment. It can therefore
be concluded that demagnetization is more e ective when the magnets are treated individually.

4.3 Test 3- di erence between single magnets and magnets in assembly at 250°C
Table 8 presents the data on the degree of demagnetization of the magnets after treatment at 250°C for
15, 35 and 60 minutes. Table A shows the demagnetization levels for points located on the north face of
the magnet, while Table B provides the values for points on the south face. In the columns labeled
"single" the average demagnetization values for the speciﬁed points on magnets treated and cooled
individually are reported. The columns labeled "air" display the average demagnetization values for
magnets treated and air-cooled within the rotor, while the columns labeled " water" show the average
demagnetization values for magnets treated in bulk and cooled in water.
The purpose of this test is to determine whether magnets assembled in bulk within the rotor exhibit a
signiﬁcantly di erent demagnetization behavior compared to magnets treated individually at a
temperature of 250°C, and to assess whether the cooling method—either rapid cooling in water or slow
cooling in air—has a notable impact on the measured degree of demagnetization after thermal
treatment.

The results from this test showed that the magnets treated individually, at the same temperature,
reached complete demagnetization at all points after 60 minutes of treatment (see Table 9).

However, magnets treated within the rotor showed di erent behavior, as they never reached complete
demagnetization (see Table 10).

treated within the rotor, cooled in water or air-cooled.

Additionally, the results for magnets treated within the rotor using di erent cooling techniques are not
signiﬁcantly di erent. In fact, the average degree of demagnetization between air cooling and water
cooling, combined with the calculated standard deviation, overlaps (see Table 11).

4.4 Test 4- DOE applied to magnets in assembly
Table 12 presents the demagnetization data for the magnets treated within the rotor, compared to their
initial measured values. Table A shows the demagnetization levels for points located on the north face
of the magnet, while Table B shows the demagnetization levels for points on the south face. The three
columns in each table display the demagnetization levels at treatment temperatures of 200°C, 250°C,
and 300°C, for durations of 15, 35, and 60 minutes for each temperature.
The aim of this test is to construct a demagnetization response surface using a DOE approach, to better
understand the inﬂuence of time and temperature when magnets are thermally treated inside the rotor.
Table 12: a) degrees of demagnetization after treatment at 200°C, 250°C, 300°C for durations of 15, 35, and 60 minutes for each
temperature for the points located on the north face of the magnet b) degrees of demagnetization after treatment at 200°C,
250°C, 300°.

The results from treating the permanent magnets at three di erent temperatures reveal that after 35
minutes at temperatures above 250°C, the magnets achieve nearly complete demagnetization at every
measurement point. In contrast, at 200°C, the demagnetization remains incomplete even after 60
minutes of treatment (see Table 13).

Using this dataset, an experimental design was created to develop a mathematical model that relates
the degree of demagnetization to the variables of time, temperature, and their interaction. The resulting
mathematical model can be used to predict the theoretically obtainable degree of demagnetization by
specifying the values of the time and temperature variables in advance.
Below are a series of graphs (Figures 9-14), generated using the "CAT" software (Leardi et al.), illustrating
the relationship between the degree of demagnetization and the variables of time and temperature. Fig.
9-10-11 displays the response curves for the average degree of demagnetization, compared to the mean
measured, respectively, at point C1N, C1S and S1N on the magnets, as a function of time and
temperature variables. Fig.12-13-14 show the three-dimensional graph from which the two-dimensional
cross-section depicted in Figure 9-10-11, respectively, is derived. The data used for constructing the
experimental design were based on the average degree of demagnetization measured at three points on
the magnets: C1N and C1S, representing the central points of the north and south faces of the magnets,
respectively, and S1N, chosen to observe the demagnetization behavior at a point located at the edge

of the magnets. The demagnetization trends for the remaining points are consistent with the trends
observed at these three selected points.
By ﬁxing a temperature corresponding to one of the three levels in the experimental design and
intersecting one of the blue curves on the graph, it is possible to determine the time required to achieve
the average degree of demagnetization indicated by the respective curve.
The experimental design reveals that there is indeed an interaction between time and temperature on
the degree of demagnetization, as evidenced by the non-linear relationship observed between the two
variables.

at point C1N on the magnets, as a function of time and temperature variables.

Figure 14: Three-dimensional graph from which the two-dimensional cross-section depicted in Figure 11 is derived.

In Fig. 12-13-14, the x-axis and y-axis represent time and temperature, respectively, with values
increasing in the directions indicated by the arrows. The z-axis shows the average degree of
demagnetization, which increases along the direction of its corresponding arrow. It is observed that the
degree of demagnetization increases more signiﬁcantly with rising temperature. This result is further
emphasized by the coe icient related to the temperature variable (T) shown in Figure 15-16-17, which is
greater than the coe icient related to the time variable (t).

In Fig.15-16-17, the values of the coe icients for the mathematical model obtained through the
experimental design are shown for points C1N, S1N, and C1S, respectively. The "Maximum Leverage"
value indicates the reliability of the mathematical model. A lower value of Maximum Leverage means
that the model is more capable of accurately predicting the demagnetization outcome when the time
and temperature variables are set in advance.
The following are the deﬁnitions of the parameters in the experimental model:


b0: Represents the constant term of the mathematical model.



t: Represents the coe icient for the linear e ect of the time variable in the model.



T: Represents the coe icient for the linear e ect of the temperature variable in the model.



t*T: Represents the coe icient for the linear interaction between the time and temperature
variables in the model.



t^2: Represents the coe icient for the quadratic e ect of the time variable in the model.



T^2: Represents the coe icient for the quadratic e ect of the temperature variable in the model.

In Figure 15-16-17, the degrees of freedom and the standard deviation of the various coe icients are
also shown. RMSECV (Root Mean Square Error of Cross-Validation) indicates the percentage error
obtained in predicting the average degree of demagnetization.

4.5 Test 5- DOE applied to single magnets
The table 14 provides data on the degree of demagnetization for magnets treated individually, compared
to their initial measured values. Table A presents the demagnetization degrees for points located on the
north face of the magnets, while Table B shows the demagnetization degrees for points on the south
face. The tables are organized into three columns, reﬂecting the degrees of demagnetization obtained
at treatment temperatures of 200°C, 250°C, and 300°C, respectively. The purpose of this test is to plot
a demagnetization curve using experimental design to understand the inﬂuence of time and
temperature on magnets treated individually.

The data collected from treating permanent magnets individually at 200°C, 250°C, and 300°C show that,
compared to treating magnets within the rotor under the same operational conditions, the average
degree of demagnetization after 10 minutes is consistently higher in all cases (see Table 15).

Except for the treatment at 200°C, demagnetization is either complete or nearly complete for magnets
treated individually after just 10 minutes of treatment (see Table 14). In all cases, the maximum
achievable degree of demagnetization for the given temperature conditions is reached after 35 minutes
of treatment (see Table 14).
As with Test 4, the results obtained were used to develop an experimental design aimed at creating a
mathematical model that summarizes the ﬁndings and can predict the average degree of
demagnetization based on predeﬁned time and temperature variables. Using this experimental design,
the graphs shown in Figures 18 through 23 were generated.
The ﬁgures 18-19-20 display the response curves for the average degree of demagnetization, compared
to the mean measured, respectively, at point C1N, C1S and S1N on the magnets, as a function of time
and temperature variables. The ﬁg. 21-22-23 show the three-dimensional graph from which the twodimensional cross-section depicted in Figure 18-19-20, respectively, is derived.
In Fig.24-25-26, the values of the coe icients for the mathematical model obtained through the
experimental design are shown for points C1N, S1N, and C1S, respectively.

5 Conclusions
During this study, the thermal demagnetization behavior of NdFeB magnets was analyzed, both when
treated individually and when assembled within the rotors of electric motors. The primary objective was
to understand how di erent variables, including the cooling method, treatment duration, and
temperature, inﬂuenced the degree of demagnetization.
A series of tests were conducted where magnets were removed from the rotors of various motors, their
initial magnetic ﬁelds were measured, and they were subsequently subjected to thermal treatments at
di erent temperatures and over progressively longer periods. Some magnets were treated individually,
while others were tested in bulk within the rotors, allowing for a comparison of results and the evaluation
of di erences in demagnetization behavior under these operational conditions.
By using di erent cooling methods (water or air cooling), it was possible to determine whether the
cooling method signiﬁcantly a ected the demagnetization behavior. Additionally, the tests at various
temperatures allowed for the assessment of how the magnets' behavior changed with varying treatment
temperatures, focusing on di erences between magnets treated at 200°C, 250°C, and 300°C.
From the results obtained through various demagnetization tests, several conclusions have been
drawn, as outlined below. Firstly, it was observed that the cooling method used to cool the magnets
before measuring the magnetic ﬁeld does not signiﬁcantly a ect the average degree of demagnetization
achieved after thermal treatment. Given the measurement error, the results obtained with either cooling
method overlap.
At each treatment temperature, there is a speciﬁc duration after which, even if the temperature is
maintained constant, the average degree of demagnetization reaches a plateau or slows down
signiﬁcantly. If the temperature is su iciently high, demagnetization becomes complete; otherwise, it
remains relatively constant and below 100%.
It has been observed that the average degree of demagnetization varies depending on the measurement
location, even when the temperature and treatment time are held constant. Magnets tend to reach the
plateau more quickly at the center compared to the edges. The average degree of demagnetization at
the edges is lower than at the center, indicating that the edges are more resistant to demagnetization.
Another notable ﬁnding is that the average degree of demagnetization achieved, when demagnetization
is not complete, di ers depending on whether the magnets are treated inside the rotor or individually. It
appears that the manner in which the magnets are assembled within the rotor a ects their response to
demagnetization, causing the demagnetization process to be slower.
Through experimental design, a mathematical model has been developed to predict the average degree
of demagnetization in relation to time and temperature variables, with an acceptable error margin of up
to approximately 2%. This model accurately predicts outcomes within the range of time and
temperature studied in the experiments.
At a 99.9% conﬁdence interval, the coe icients obtained from the mathematical model are statistically
signiﬁcant. This indicates that not only do the linear terms for time and temperature signiﬁcantly
contribute to the degree of demagnetization, but the interaction between time and temperature and the
quadratic terms also have signiﬁcant e ects. If this were not the case, the model could have been
simpliﬁed by eliminating some of these terms.
The coe icients for time (t) and temperature (T) in the mathematical model show that the coe icient
associated with temperature is consistently greater than that associated with time. This suggests that
the e ect of temperature on demagnetization is more inﬂuent than that of time.
