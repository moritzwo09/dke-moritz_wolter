Abstract
Iodine oxidation reactions play an important role in environmental, biological, and industrial
contexts. The multiphase reaction between aqueous iodide and ozone is of particular interest due to its
prevalence in the marine atmosphere and unique reactivity at the air-water interface. Here, we explore the
concentration dependence of the I- + O3 reaction in levitated microdroplets under both acidic and basic
conditions. To interpret the experimental kinetics, molecular simulations are used to benchmark a kinetic
model, which enables insight into the reactivity of the interface, the nanometer-scale sub-surface region,
and the bulk interior of the droplet. For all experiments, a kinetic description of gas- and liquid-phase
diffusion is critical to interpreting the results. We find that the surface dominates the iodide oxidation
kinetics under concentrated and acidic conditions, with the reactive uptake coefficient approaching an
upper limit of 10-2 at pH 3. In contrast, reactions in the sub-surface dominate under more dilute and
alkaline conditions, with inhibition of the surface reaction at pH 12 and an uptake coefficient that is 10x
smaller. The origin of a changing surface mechanism with pH is explored and compared to previous ozonedependent measurements.

I. Introduction
Global chemical models investigating iodine chemistry in the atmosphere have sought to
understand how global concentrations and local emissions influence oxidant concentrations.1–4 Recent
work demonstrated that iodine oxides are a significant source of atmospheric new particle formation,5,6
with the potential to influence climate through aerosol chemistry and cloud formation.7,8 In these largely
gas-phase environments, volatile iodine species originate from the sea surface—the release of which
begins with oxidation of aqueous I- in the chemically-complex environment of the sea surface microlayer.9
Iodide is also emitted into the atmosphere in sea spray aerosol, an environment where salt concentrations
can increase dramatically compared to seawater.10 Differences in the chemical reactivity of iodine between
sea spray aerosol and seawater, and potential implications for overall marine O3 deposition rates remains
under investigation.11 From this environmental perspective, the multiphase chemistry of iodine consists
of a reaction network that connects ocean processes with atmospheric microphysics and chemistry.
The I- + O3 reaction is often used to measure the mass accommodation coefficient of O3 in water,
with I- acting as a reactive scavenger due to its high reactivity in solution.12,13 An understanding of O3
accommodation, however, is obscured by the chemical makeup of the air-water interface and by changes
in iodide availability in the presence of different salts under various concentrations. While it is generally
observed from both experiment and theory that the iodide is surface active14–19 (the degree to which is still
contested),20 how this bulk-to-surface partitioning affects the observed reaction kinetics and therefore O3
uptake remains unclear. More generally for multiphase kinetics, the degree to which a surface reaction
will contribute to measured kinetics relative to the bulk depends sensitively on underlying physical
processes such as trace gas diffusion, adsorption to the interface, solvation into the liquid, and liquid
diffusion. In this context, the I- + O3 reaction is an important model system for assessing mass transport
mechanisms governing multiphase chemistry.
Due to the challenges outlined above, a detailed understanding of the multiphase I- + O3 reaction
mechanism has proven elusive, particularly in distinguishing surface vs. bulk reactivity. As we previously
observed in aqueous microdroplets, the I- + O3 reaction under concentrated salt conditions occurs almost
exclusively at the air-water interface, but is complicated by the apparent pH dependence of the reaction.21
This previous work focused on the I- decay kinetics at a single iodide concentration, which limits our
knowledge of how the O3 uptake mechanism evolves with concentration especially under dilute
conditions. Here, we report reaction kinetics of aqueous iodide with O3 in levitated microdroplets for a

range of initial iodide concentration using an open-port sampling interface (OPSI) coupled with mass
spectrometry (MS) as described previously.21–23 Molecular simulations of I- at the air water interface and
a recently developed reaction-diffusion kinetic model are used to interpret the experimental results.
Emphasis is placed on the further development of the kinetic model, which is refined to address liquidand gas- diffusion. The model is constrained by results of molecular dynamics simulations of O3 and ions
at the air-water interface. Together, model and experiment suggest the I- + O3 surface reaction is
considerably slower than the bulk, and at pH 3 more closely resembles the lower reaction efficiency of
the gas-phase reaction. Under basic conditions, the surface reaction effectively vanishes, suggesting a
fundamental relationship between solution pH and stability of reactants or intermediates at the air-water
interface. These results demonstrate the necessity for accurate mass transport descriptions across the gasliquid interface in order to isolate surface-specific reaction information.
II. Experimental
Measurements of the oxidation kinetics of iodide by ozone in single microdroplets were carried
out as described in Prophet et al.21 and previous reports from co-workers.24–26 Experiments were conducted
using a quadrupole electrodynamic trap (QET) where microdroplets, generated by a piezoelectric
microdroplet dispenser (Microfab, 30 μm orifice), are charged and trapped by a quadrupole field. Within
the QET, DC electrodes are used to balance a collection of ~100 microdroplets over the course of an
oxidation experiment. Once droplets are trapped, a steady flow of O3 mixed with humidified air is directed
through the reactor to oxidize the droplets. During oxidation, individual microdroplets are released from
an upper balancing region to a lower region where the droplet is illuminated by a 532 nm laser diode
directed axially through the reactor. Mie scattering from the individual droplets are collected at 90° relative
to the illumination axis and the interference pattern analyzed to obtain droplet radius. Droplet radius is
quantified by comparing peak spacing to a reference library containing simulated peak positions using a
fixed refractive index.25,27 A representative interference pattern for droplet size analysis is included in
Supplemental Information section SI-2. For the current experiments, the droplet radius was measured to
be r = 17 ± 1 μm, with an average change in droplet size during reaction of ~1 μm. The initial droplet
radius generated from this model of dispenser before equilibration in the QET is r ~ 25 μm.28,29
Once sized, droplets are ejected from the QET and analyzed using an open-port sampling interface
(OPSI) for single droplet electrospray mass spectrometry (MS)22,30 as described by Prophet et al.21 Droplet
composition is monitored throughout the oxidation reaction using OPSI-MS, where each individual

detection event yields single droplet composition as a function of O3 exposure time. A sketch of the
experimental diagram is shown in Fig. 1, along with example droplet detection events and respective peak
areas for a typical oxidation experiment. Example single droplet mass spectra before and after reaction
are included in section SI-2, together with a discussion of observed peaks in the mass spectra.
While the general experimental setup mirrors that described by recent work,21 droplet composition
for each experimental condition was altered to study the reactive uptake of O3 as a function of initial NaI
(Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.5%) concentration. For all experiments, the relative humidity (RH) inside of the
QET was held at RH = 88 ± 1%. The initial droplet solution for each iodide concentration condition was
adjusted using NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.5%) to establish a water activity of aw = 0.96 ± 0.01. Salt
concentrations necessary for this condition were calculated using the AIOMFAC thermodynamic
model31,32 and further verified using a water-activity meter (Aqualab 4TE). Once dispensed into the QET,
the water activity in the droplet equilibrated to the trap RH, and the salt concentration in the droplet was
determined with AIOMFAC. Concentrations used for each condition are provided in Tables S2 and S3 in
supplemental section SI-2. Fresh solutions were prepared daily using HPLC-grade water (Sigma-Aldrich),
with pH adjusted using citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.5%) and NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 98%).

III. Model Description
To interpret the observed microdroplet reaction kinetics, we employ a combined modeling
approach where molecular simulations are performed to constrain relevant parameters necessary to run a
kinetic model executed using the stochastic-based simulation software, Kinetiscope©.33 In addition to this
system, Kinetiscope has been used to explore a number of other chemical and physical processes in
microcompartments.34,35 A comprehensive list of the kinetic steps implemented in Kinetiscope is provided
in the Supplemental Information, section SI-1 and Table S1.

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the behavior of O3 and I- at the air-water
interface, providing information about surface concentrations and kinetic timescales for processes such as
surface-desorption, diffusion, and bulk-solvation. The details of simulating O3 at the air-water interface
have been described in recent work,21,36 and the present work uses the same approach. To investigate the
interfacial chemical makeup of systems encountered in the experiments, simulations were performed with
varying concentrations of NaI to observe how the effective surface concentration of I- changes when
transitioning from a dilute regime (mM concentrations) to a more concentrated one (M concentrations). A
water slab with containing 768 water molecules in a box of 24.8× 24.8 × 111.8 Å3 was used to simulate
an aqueous droplet where the larger dimension is perpendicular to the air-water interface. A classical
polarizable force field, SWM4-NDP,37 was employed for the molecular dynamics simulation. The
nonbonded interactions were modelled with a Lennard-Jones potential.21,36 We applied a rigid body
dynamics for water and ozone molecules. A Drude oscillator model38 was implemented to replicate
polarization in the simulation.

are shown in blue, brown, and purple, respectively.

Simulation results for I- partitioning between the bulk phase and the interface were incorporated
into the kinetic model using a simple Langmuir framework as detailed below in section III.C.(i).
Additionally, mixtures of NaI and NaCl were simulated to explore the relative surface propensities of
these ions in solution and any dependence on the relative quantities of different ions in solution. A more

kinetics is provided in the supplemental information section SI-3.
B. Kinetic Model Framework
The kinetic model for multiphase oxidation draws on a number of recent publications detailing the
mechanics of the model and discussing the origins of each kinetic step that is used.21,26,39 In the following
section, we summarize the main components of the model and introduce an approach to simulate subsurface reaction dynamics. Our approach aims to identify spatial regions of the multiphase system with
distinct governing kinetics, allowing for the relevant chemistry to be simulated in each region without
explicitly resolving chemical gradients. A conceptual picture of these distinct kinetic regions and their
related length scales is shown in Fig. 3. Up to this point, previous models using this approach have relied
on discretizing the microdroplet into only two separate regions: the droplet surface, and the bulk
interior.26,35,39–41 In the following, we first provide an overview of the model geometry before describing
the mass-transport and chemical steps used to run the kinetic simulations.
(i) Overall Simulation Geometry & Surface Region Definition
The geometry of the simulated microdroplet follows the general approach used in previous
studies.35,42 The microdroplet is represented using a rectangular prism divided into sub-compartments with
length scales weighted to give the correct scaling of a sphere. A surface compartment is defined with a
1x1 nm2 area and a height of δ = 1 nm, corresponding approximately to the length scale of water density
attenuation across the interface (Fig. 4A). The remainder of the simulated prism (representing the
remaining microdroplet volume) is then constrained to have area 1x1 nm2 and a height of R/3, assuring
that the simulation geometry conserves the surface area to volume ratio of a sphere. No sensitivity is
observed to the absolute simulated area when the bulk to surface compartments are weighted in this way.
(ii) Sub-surface & Bulk Interior Region Definitions
To capture bulk chemistry occurring within the microdroplet, the inner R/3 droplet length is further
divided into two distinct compartments: a sub-surface and bulk-interior region. The sub-surface region is
conceptualized as the spherical shell beneath the outer surface where ozone diffusion is competitive with
the reaction rate in the bulk. Naturally, the length scale of this region is defined using the “reaction𝐷

diffusion” length of O3, Lrxn = √𝑘∙[I𝑙𝑖𝑞−], where Dliq is the diffusion coefficient of O3 in solution and krxn the
7

bimolecular reaction rate for I- + O3. The reaction-diffusion length is commonly encountered in the study
of chemical reactivity in liquids, and is especially relevant for chemical kinetics in microcompartments
where physical dimensions are of the same order.43 Fig. 3 provides a conceptual sketch of the sub-surface
and bulk-interior regions in reference to a microdroplet and their respective projections into the simulation
geometry.
Within Kinetiscope, this sub-surface region is implemented with a reaction-diffusion (RD)
compartment situated between the surface and the bulk-interior compartments and is initialized with
height Lrxn using the initial iodide concentration [I− ]0 for each experiment. This definition neglects the
fact that Lrxn changes dynamically throughout the reaction as [I − ] is consumed. However, since Lrxn is
inversely proportional to √[I − ], the change in Lrxn from its initial value as I- is consumed is relatively
small over the experimental timescale, and the initial Lrxn proves to be a reasonable approximation.
Functionally, the RD compartment allows for droplet reactivity due to the ozone gradient extending into
the droplet while avoiding the full gradient resolution as is commonly done to explore multiphase
oxidation kinetics using multi-layer kinetic models.44 An in-depth exploration of the utility of the RD
compartment and its ability to capture the behavior of reaction-diffusion fronts in more general chemical
kinetics will be provided in an upcoming publication, as a full discussion would be too exhaustive in the
present work.
Since the entire simulated droplet height must equal R/3, the bulk-interior region is simulated with
an inner-bulk compartment of height Lbulk = R/3 - Lrxn. This compartment represents the inner core of the
droplet beyond the diffusive O3 gradient where only a very small fraction of chemistry occurs.
Functionally, this compartment is a source of I- that diffuses into the RD and surface compartments. For
the more general case where Lrxn > R/3 (a case not encountered in the current work), Lbulk is defined to be
0 and the RD compartment height is defined to be R/3. Although we have only considered
compartmentalization of the liquid phase, we include in Fig. 3 the same conceptual principle applied to
the gas phase, with a gas-diffusive region and gas-adsorption region identified above the droplet surface.
While we include this for conceptual completeness, these regions are not explicitly simulated in the current
model and can be effectively included as single kinetic steps in the surface compartment (which, while
applicable to this system, is not generally true for other multiphase processes). Details of the current gasphase diffusion description and adsorption to the droplet surface are included below in section III.C.

conceptual kinetic regions of the model including an outer gas-diffusion layer, the droplet surface, the reactiondiffusion region, and the inner bulk region. Key physical length scales used to define the kinetic model
compartments are included.

C. Physical and Chemical Mechanistic Steps
A number of mechanistic steps describing physical and chemical processes are defined in the
model to simulate the overall reaction progress. The majority of these steps and overall reaction
mechanism have been previously published21,26,39 so an exhaustive discussion of these steps will not be
provided. Instead, emphasis is given to the particular steps that distinguish this work from the previous,
namely, the adsorption behavior of the iodide ion at the air-water interface, the diffusional transport of O3
to the interface, and the surface vs. bulk rate coefficient used for the primary I- + O3 reaction. Since the
chemical mechanism has been explored in detail in previous work,21 this mechanism is largely reproduced
for the current model. One additional chemical consideration is the reactivity of Cl- with products of the
I- + O3 reaction. Details on these additional mechanistic steps are included in supplemental section SI-1,
with deviations from the previous model21 being emphasized in bold.
(i) Surface Concentrations and Langmuir-Adsorption of Aqueous Iodide
Surface concentrations are of particular importance for distinguishing surface and bulk reactivity.
In the kinetic model, surface concentrations of I- and O3 are described as simple Langmuir-adsorption. In

previous work, particular attention was given to surface concentrations of O3 and the
adsorption/desorption kinetics at the interface. We refer the reader to previous work21,36 for more
discussion on O3 density at the air water interface, and provide only a key result in Fig. 4 (A) showing the
enhanced O3 concentration at the interface. Surface concentrations of iodide in the current model are
related to the bulk using a kinetic step where bulk-aqueous phase iodide, having diffused into the surface
compartment, can adsorb to an available site at the interface:

on methods used and frameworks employed for analysis. In the current approach, we conduct a series of
simulations to obtain density profiles of I- across a simulated water slab for different bulk iodide
concentrations. Fig. 4 (B) shows these density profiles for bulk concentrations ranging from 40 mM to 1
M, where the density scale is normalized to the bulk solution density. To obtain the Langmuir-type
information necessary for the kinetic model, we use the results in Fig. 4 (B) to extract an effective surface
concentration under each condition by averaging the density across the top 1 nm of solution (from 14 Å
to 24 Å) for each density profile. Surface concentrations defined in this way are then compared to their
respective bulk concentration, averaged from 0 to 5 Å, as shown in Fig. 4 (C). We fit the results shown in

more realistic set of parameters to simulate the effective surface concentrations of sodium iodide within a
Langmuir framework—although we acknowledge that the Langmuir framework may have limitations for
describing ion adsorption to interfaces. For example, the subtle structural features in the density profiles
in Fig. 4 (B) are lost when using a simple Langmuir model. Nevertheless, this approach provides a surface
vs. bulk description of the iodide ion, which generally agrees with the current literature, where the effective
surface concentration of iodide is weakly enhanced and largely resembles the bulk, especially for more

absolute rates shows that our kinetic results are independent of these values for ksolv > 1000 s-1. While we
are not sensitive to these rates above ksolv = 1000 s-1, we note that one would generally expect the absolute

solvation rates for small ions to be closer to a diffusional timescale across the interfacial thickness,
resembling a rate constant ksolv ~ 108 – 109 s-1.
(ii) Gas-Phase Diffusion and Adsorption of O3
Adsorption and desorption of O3 to the interface has been previously described,21,36 where the
timescale of desorption is calculated using the potential of mean force for O3 at the air-water interface,
computable from umbrella sampling.21,36 This potential of mean force determines the density profile of O3
at the interface (see Fig. 4 (A)) and, along with a Langmuir-adsorption description, an adsorption rate to
the interface. We find this adsorption rate (see step S2 in Table S1) agrees well with a simple collision rate
𝑐

calculated from kinetic theory: 𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑙 = 4⋅𝛿 = 9×1010 s-1, where c̅ is the mean molecular speed of O3 in the
gas phase at 293 K and 𝛿 the surface thickness 𝛿 = 1 nm. We include an additional gas-phase transport
step to simulate the diffusional timescale of O3 across a spherical shell surrounding the droplet, illustrated
in Fig. 3. The thickness of this shell is defined to be the droplet radius r, the length scale found in the
steady-state solution of the diffusion equation with a spherical sink.45 Gas diffusion across this shell
functionally determines an upper-bound for the rate of O3 transport to the droplet interface, limiting the
overall reactivity if the loss rate of O3 at the interface exceeds this diffusion rate. To identify this limiting
rate for gas-diffusion, we consider the flux 𝑄 of O3 through a surrounding gas shell for arbitrarily large
thickness, which converges to a lower-bound for O3 flux onto the droplet surface 𝑄 = 4𝜋𝑟𝐷𝑔𝑎𝑠 where
Dgas is the diffusion coefficient of O3 in air.45,46 From an interfacial perspective, a first-order rate

description to future work.

In general, it is difficult to anticipate if a surface rate coefficient should deviate from its bulk
counterpart.48–50 In the current approach we fix the bulk reaction rate to a reported aqueous value51 of
1.2×109 M-1 s-1 (with literature values ranging from 1-3.4 ×109 M-1 s-1 at 25°C)52 and treat the surface
reaction rate as an adjustable parameter. This in principle accounts for altered reaction rate barriers at the
−

I
interface, as well as potential inaccuracies in 𝐾𝑒𝑞
deduced from the simulations. We find an effective

surface rate coefficient of 6×107 M-1 s-1 best explains the experimental results. The significance of this
value, along with an assessment of uniqueness and uncertainty, is included below in section V.
IV. Experimental Results
Kinetics of I- oxidation by O3 for initial iodide concentrations ranging from 8 mM to 3.8 M are
presented in this section for microdroplets generated using acidic (pH 3) and basic (pH 12) solutions.
Experimental results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 alongside output from the kinetic simulations. We include
two model scenarios with each experimental condition that are discussed in the analysis and discussion
sections below. The primary model conforms to the full description above in Section III and contains all
steps listed in Table S1. A secondary model scenario, termed “bulk-only” simply shows a model simulation
that omits the I- + O3 surface reaction.
Data in Fig. 5 shows results for droplet solution with pH 3 where individual points represent
normalized peak areas for single OPSI-MS detection events at m/z = 126.9, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Each
experimental condition includes data from 3 individual reaction trials using microdroplets with radius r =
17 ± 1 μm. For all the acidic experiments, 300 mM of citric acid/citrate buffer was used to keep the pH
close to the initial pH 3 during reaction. The shape of the kinetic profiles for the acidic experiments appears
largely insensitive to initial concentration, where the profiles appear mostly linear, with a small but
noticeable tail at longer reaction times. In the following analysis section, the degree of agreement between
experiment and the kinetic model predictions is explored more closely, with special attention given to
distinguishing surface vs. bulk reactivity.

Fig. 5: Series of iodide-oxidation experiments showing decay of normalized iodide concentration [I-]/[I-]0 for
initial [I-]0 ranging from 8 mM to 1.6 M with solution pH 3. Datapoints represent individual microdroplet
detection events quantified by peak area of iodide detection normalized to the initial unreacted peak area, as
shown in Fig. 1 (B) and (C). Model results are included, showing two simulation cases. The full model case
(black dashed lines) shows the entirety of the model detailed in section III. The bulk-only model (blue dotted
lines) is simulated using the same model but neglecting the surface I - + O3 reaction. Concentration conditions
for each experiment are provided in supplemental Table S2.

Data in Fig. 6 shows the oxidation of aqueous iodide at pH 12, where each dataset originates from
three individual trials conducted on microdroplets with an initial radius r = 17 μm. Experiments range
from initial [I-] of 8 mM to 3.8 M, and in this case, the decay profiles exhibit a qualitative change with
initial [I-]. For concentrations ~100 mM and below, the decays resemble first-order kinetics, showing a
linear profile, with a small but significant tail when the normalized iodide concentration [I-]/[I-]0 ~25%.
For concentrations >100 mM, a noticeable decrease is observed in the kinetics, where the rate of decay
appears to suddenly slow when the remaining iodide is ~50% of its initial concentration.
As the plateau behavior is not recovered in the kinetic simulations, the origin of this effect remains
unclear. However, IO- likely becomes relatively concentrated in solution under these conditions, due to
the higher initial [I-] and as suggested by the kinetic simulations. The self-disproportionation of IO- to
generate IO3- and I- has long been observed experimentally,53,54 and along with related transformations,
has been subject to intense experimental and modeling investigation.55–58 Furthermore, photochemistry of
IO- may become relevant due to ambient laboratory light or from the 532 nm laser used for droplet

illumination. McKinon et al.59 report both photodetachment and photodissociation of IO- for exposure to
a relatively broad wavelength range centered around 515 nm, albeit only evidenced in the gas phase.
Regeneration of I- from either the chemical or photo-chemical decomposition of IO- would show a distinct
slowing of I- consumption kinetics, a trend consistent with the experimental kinetic profiles. To verify this
mechanism, experiments targeting the full redox chemistry of IO-, IO2-, and IO3- in aqueous iodide
microdroplets should be investigated, along with a more complete chemical model to include this
chemistry. While outside the scope of the current work, oxidation experiments under dark conditions are
also needed to isolate any photochemistry of iodine-oxides from alternate chemical decomposition routes.

Model results for the pH 3 solution are shown in Fig. 5, where the full model scenario is in
reasonable agreement for the concentration range studied. Initial rates of decay are notably in agreement
between model and experiment, with the model showing deviation from some experiments in the latter
half of the decay profiles. This deviation is likely due to the static RD compartment length being fixed to
the initial conditions rather than changing dynamically with [I-], resulting in an underprediction of the
overall I- consumption with time. This constraint can likely be avoided by numerically evaluating the
governing rate equations directly rather than using the stochastic simulation approach with a fixed
geometry. In the pH 12 case shown in Fig. 6, general agreement is also observed, but exclusively for the
bulk-only model where the surface reaction is neglected. The model does not reproduce the plateau-type
decay behavior observed in the experiments with higher salt concentrations, suggesting the model neglects
secondary processes that interfere with the primary consumption of I- resulting from the I- + O3 reaction—
likely involving the stability and reactivity of intermediates IO- and IO2-, and potential routes to Iregeneration. Nevertheless, initial reaction rates come into close agreement for all conditions studied.
Many of the insights mentioned above are also evident by comparing experimental and modeled
uptake coefficients, shown in Fig. 7. Experimental uptake coefficients for each condition are calculated
from the initial reaction rate 𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 combined with a previous formulation for uptake21,60

.

Eq. 2

Here, 𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝 is not corrected for the reaction stoichiometry, so 𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝 expresses an observed reactive uptake
coefficient derived from the solute consumption rate. To calculate the true reactive uptake of O3, 𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝 must
be divided by a factor of two when I2 is the product of the reaction. For simplicity, we consider only the
observed uptake 𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝 in the following analysis.
Uptake coefficients from the model are calculated directly by analyzing the output of the stochastic
simulations, which provides the number of selections for each kinetic step, or event, after a given
simulation period. The reactive uptake coefficient in this case is simply the ratio of reaction events selected
and ozone-surface collision events, Nrxn / Ncol. To compare directly to the empirical approach used in Eq.
2, we use the expected collision selection number Ncol which neglects the influence of gas-phase diffusion.
Using this analysis, surface and bulk reactivity can be distinguished by using the Nrxn corresponding to
the number of reaction events selected in the surface compartment or from the reactions selected in the

bulk (comprising events selected in the RD compartment and inner bulk compartment but dominated by
the RD compartment under our conditions). Uptake due to bulk and surface reactivity is shown in Fig. 7
following this approach, along with the sum total. Also included in Fig. 7 (A) is a comparison to previous
experimental measurements of ozone uptake in aqueous iodide droplets from droplet-train and flow tube
experiments. In Fig. 7 (B) we compare our results to model predictions of subsurface chemistry using the
resistor-model formulation in the liquid-diffusion limited case.61
As shown in Fig. 7 (A), uptake for the pH 3 condition is mostly driven by bulk chemistry when
iodide concentrations < 50 mM but dominated by surface chemistry when [I-] > 50 mM. This result is
expected, since the reaction-diffusion length decreases from ~14 nm to ~1 nm across this concentration
range and the surface approaches its saturation concentration for I-. With increasing [I-], the shape of the
uptake curve suggests an approach to a limiting value of ~10-2. This order of uptake has been similarly
observed for O3 uptake by concentrated aqueous iodide using a droplet-train apparatus12 and a flow tube
containing sub-micron iodide aerosol.62,63 In the model, we find this upper-bound results from the reactionrate limit at the surface, with only a small contribution from gas phase diffusive limitations. For the pH
12 shown in Fig. 7 (B), the uptake calculated from the bulk-only model is presented along with
experiments (a comparison to the full model, including surface reaction, is provided in section SI-4).
Below 500 mM, the uptake scales as √[I− ], as expected for liquid diffusion limited kinetics. For
concentrated solutions, however, we observe a slight bend in the uptake dependence as the uptake begins
to become limited by the solvation (or accommodation) mechanistic step, similarly observed in the resistor
model when including accommodation and diffusive resistor terms. This observation demonstrates how
chemistry in what might be considered strictly sub-surface or “bulk” regions are influenced by mass
transport limitations occurring at the surface, whereas one may typically assume such phenomena to be
decoupled.

VI. Discussion
From the model comparison to the experimental results above, a number of features and implications
warrant further discussion. The surface rate coefficient, found to agree with the experimental results at pH
3, is krxn = 6×107 M-1 s-1 and approximately 20x smaller than the bulk reaction rate constant. The magnitude
of this rate coefficient is coupled to the modelled surface concentration since the effective reactivity of the

interface depends on both the iodide concentration and the rate coefficient. Therefore, a more accurate
𝑠𝑟𝑓

−
statement regarding surface and bulk reactivity at pH 3 is the surface reactive term 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛 ⋅ [I(𝑎𝑑𝑠)
] is ~ 5%
−
𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘
of the corresponding bulk reactive term 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛
⋅ [I(𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘)
]. The uncertainty in the true rate coefficient for the

surface reaction is convoluted with any uncertainty in the modelled surface concentration.
Although a surface rate coefficient that is ~5% of the bulk value may seem unexpected, it is
instructive to compare the liquid- and the gas-phase rate coefficients for additional context. One argument
for the uniqueness of droplet chemistry is the potential for reaction coordinates at the gas-liquid interface
to have energetic profiles that begin to resemble the profiles encountered in the gas phase.64,65
Measurements of gas-phase I- + O3 kinetics within an ion trap66 reported a forward rate coefficient of
6.6×108 M-1 s-1, a value that is slower than the corresponding aqueous value of 1×109 M-1 s-1.51,52 Given
the large difference in gas and liquid diffusivities, quantifying reactivity on a per-collision basis provides
a cleaner comparison. In the gas phase, the reaction probability per encounter is reported to be φg =
0.13%,66 whereas for the corresponding liquid phase efficiency, we calculate φl ~ 10%. The liquid phase
estimate is computed by comparing the reported rate coefficient to an estimated diffusive encounter
frequency in a bulk solution.67 Given that the reactivity on a per-collision basis differs by almost two
orders of magnitude in moving from the liquid to gas-phase, it is plausible that reactivity at the interface
also decreases relative to the bulk, albeit not to the extent of the gas-phase. In addition to the I- + O3
reaction, measurements have been made on the O3 oxidation of an iodide-water cluster I(H2O)-,
demonstrating significantly higher efficiency than the reaction with bare I-.68 While it is difficult to connect
these observations directly to reactivity at air-water interface, these trends support our hypothesis that the
reaction efficiency in solution likely tapers off across the air-water interface and approaches the gas-phase
efficiency.
−
Uncertainty in [I(𝑎𝑑𝑠)
] in the kinetic model is complicated by the presence of chloride in the

experiments, which has not been explicitly included at the interface. Furthermore, in order to maintain a
constant droplet size under each experimental condition, the amount of Cl- in each experiment varies with
the overall iodide concentration, as shown in Tables S2 and S3. To investigate the ion-ion interactions
between I- and Cl- at the interface, we perform molecular simulations of NaI/NaCl mixtures in water and
analyze the density profiles and energetics at the air-water interface. Details of simulations and results
from this analysis are included in supplemental section SI-3. Fig. S4 provides density profiles for I- and
Cl- in the simulated salt mixtures for a series of compositions where the I-:Cl- ion ratio is varied from 4:1
19

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-pjztm ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0264-0872 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

to 1:10. This ion ratio reports the total number of ions simulated within the water slab in entirety, not
delineating between surface and bulk regions. The bulk concentrations of iodide in these simulations
generally range between 50-70 mM, while the chloride concentrations are scaled between 1.2 M to 70
mM.
Chloride density profiles in Fig. S4 (B) show an unexpected enhancement of Cl- near the air-water
interface for concentrated conditions. With increasing surface [Cl-], the surface density of I- is suppressed
as demonstrated in the density profile in Fig. S4 (A) and in the reduction of the solvation free energy
profile in Fig. S4 (C). However, even under the most concentrated chloride conditions, with ion ratio 1:10,
the effective surface concentration of I- is roughly half of what is predicted by the pure I- case shown in
Fig. 4 (B) and (C). As such, the Cl- effect on the observed chemistry is likely to be relatively minor.
Nevertheless, this effect could contribute to the shift between bulk and surface reaction mechanisms
observed in Fig. 7 (A). These findings may be more relevant to natural systems where I- is extremely dilute
compared to Cl-, as in the case of seawater. Since the I-:Cl- in seawater ~10-7, we would expect iodide
adsorption to the interface to be very energetically unfavorable. This concentration analysis, the discussion
of gas and liquid rate coefficients above, along with a consideration of reaction-diffusion lengths, agrees
well with the observation from Schneider et al.69 that ozone-oxidation of simulated seawater proceeds
through iodide oxidation in a subsurface layer on the order of ~10 μm.
Unlike the acidic case, the kinetic model suggests the surface reaction plays a very minor role (if
any) in the oxidation kinetics at pH 12. This becomes evident when comparing model scenarios where the
surface reaction is included vs. removed entirely. Similar to the discussion of the results at pH 3, we are
limited in what specific surface information can be obtained from this observation. In this case, the surface
𝑠𝑟𝑓

−
reactivity term 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛 ⋅ [I(𝑎𝑑𝑠)
] is completely masked by the corresponding reaction term in the bulk, so any

degree of surface contribution cannot be identified. By inspecting the sensitivity of the surface rate
coefficient in the model, we can only identify that the overall surface reactivity is equal or less than ~1%
−
𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘
of the bulk term 𝑘𝑟𝑥𝑛
⋅ [I(𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘)
].

As reported in recent work,21 the apparent rate coefficient for the oxidation of iodide under basic
conditions appears ~100x smaller than the measured reaction rate in acidic solution. We have hypothesized
that this change in rate coefficient is related to the stability of the iodide-ozone adduct IOOO- in solution
and at the surface. However, given that the updated model can distinguish surface and sub-surface
reactivity with higher fidelity, it is now apparent that the bulk rate likely remains constant from pH 3 to
20

pH 12, with only the surface rate changing significantly. We propose two possible explanations for this
observation. The first, that the IOOO- intermediate is significantly stabilized at the interface under basic
conditions, with the dissociation barrier to IO- becoming larger in a partially solvated environment.
Researchers observing the adduct BrOOO- using XPS propose a similar hypothesis of surfacestabilization,70 although under acidic conditions rather than basic. The second, and potentially more
controversial, explanation is that the presence of ~ mM concentrations of OH- in the alkaline solution
greatly suppress [I-] near the air water interface. While we believe this explanation is less likely than the
first, given our assessment of ion-ion interactions at the interface at the pH 3, the presence of mM
concentrations of OH- could potentially alter the energetics of solvated I- at the interface, an investigation
of which is beyond the scope of the current work.
VII. Conclusion
Surface reactivity is commonly invoked to explain unexpected kinetic observations in microdroplets
due to the increasing surface-to-volume ratio of a spherical particle with decreasing radius. However,
identifying the reactive contribution of the droplet surface compared to the bulk is notoriously
challenging—not only due to the quantification of physical processes such as diffusion and adsorption at
liquid interfaces, but also in the determination of reactant concentrations and reaction rates at the
interface.71 These quantities may be predicted to deviate dramatically from their bulk counterparts
depending on the specifics of the system,72,73 yet there are no generally recognized approaches for
predicting how these quantities may change.
Here we have presented measurements of aqueous iodide oxidation by ozone in microdroplets while
further developing a multiphase kinetic model for interpretation of the observed kinetics. This model
accounts for the relative fraction of surface vs. bulk reactions occurring in the experiments presented using
acidic and basic microdroplets for a range of iodide concentrations. Our comprehension of surface
reactivity ultimately relies on a molecular picture of the air-water interface, constrained in the kinetic
model by molecular simulations of I-/Cl- and O3 at the interface and in solution. Both the static and
dynamic physical properties of the simulated reactants are critical for designing an accurate representation
of the interface, which in turn governs an effective representation of the bulk.
The conceptual framework for this multiphase mechanism has been refined to include both gas- and
liquid-phase diffusive properties, a key description that allows us to identify unique surface processes. We
find that the overall reactivity of I- + O3 at the interface is suppressed relative to the bulk and depends on

the acidity of solution. Under acidic conditions, surface reaction is observed, but with an efficiency
significantly lower than that of the bulk solution, and not dissimilar to the efficiency of the gas-phase
reaction. Under basic conditions, no contribution of the surface is observed, which we ascribe to the unique
stability of the adduct IOOO- at the interface. Experiment and theory, combined through application of the
kinetic model, have suggested that the droplet surface is a unique chemical environment which requires
future work to understand in full detail. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the current model
framework and experimental approach provides a route to distinguishing reactive properties of the surface
from the bulk, laying the groundwork for further investigations of more general chemical reactivity at gasliquid interfaces.
