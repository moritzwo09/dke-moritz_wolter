Abstract
Freshly emitted air pollutants may not represent real-world exposure conditions in human
studies, especially for communities exposed to aged air pollutants. This study presents the
design and characterization of a new oxidative flow reactor (OFR), named the Fast-oxidation
Box (FoxBox, volume of 1019 L). Our aim is to simulate atmospheric aging of diesel exhaust
(DE) with this system for cellular (in vitro) and controlled human studies, a unique capability
globally. We measured: (a) residence time distribution (RTD) for DE-derived CO2, SO2, and
particles, (b) DE particle transmission efficiency, (c) low-volatility organic compounds
(LVOC) losses, and (d) particle size distribution, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation,
and aerosol mass spectra of DE during photochemical oxidation (from OH exposure of (1.9 to
9.5)×1011 molec cm-3 s). Our results demonstrate turbulent flow-like conditions in FoxBox with
narrower RTD for particles than gases. The particle transmission efficiency was nearly 100%
for mobility diameters between 15 and 615 nm. LVOC losses to FoxBox walls were minimal.
The changes in particle size distributions (e.g., formation of ultrafine particles) and chemical
composition (e.g., SOA formation, increased O:C, etc.) during photochemical oxidation in
FoxBox were like those observed in the atmosphere and other OFRs. Our preliminary study on
cell viability found that photochemical oxidation significantly reduced cell viability, supporting
observations that communities distant from air pollution sources are affected and vulnerable.
The controlled human exposures with more realistic aerosol characteristics, such as those
produced by FoxBox, may provide critical insight in this regard that has been lacking to date.
Keywords: Residence time distribution, particle transmission efficiency, diesel exhaust, lowvolatile organic compounds, secondary organic aerosol, photochemical oxidation, cell viability.

1. Introduction
Aerosol are fundamental to air pollution and have a significant impact on Earth’s climate
and public health. Aerosol perturb the Earth’s climate system by scattering and absorption of
solar and terrestrial radiation. They also act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei,
affecting the lifetime and precipitation of clouds. Increasing evidence from epidemiological
and toxicological research indicates that global exposure to atmospheric air pollution,
especially PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm), has increased by
20% between 1990 and 2013 (Brauer et al. 2016), and is strongly linked with adverse health
outcomes such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Cohen et al. 2017; Pope and
Dockery 2006).
Atmospheric PM2.5 includes inorganic and organic species such as ammonium (NH4+ ),
−
sulphate (SO−
4 ), nitrate (NO3 ), chloride (Cl ), organic aerosol (OA), elemental carbon (EC),

etc., and trace metals (Jimenez et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2000). OA constitute a dominant
fraction (~20 to 90%) of PM2.5 on a global scale and are directly emitted from combustion
sources, such as burning wood and traffic-related (vehicular) activities, in particle phase as
primary organic aerosol (POA) (Jimenez et al. 2009; Kanakidou et al. 2005; Pöschl 2005).
They can also form as secondary organic aerosol (SOA) through a variety of gas-phase and
multiphase heterogeneous reactions, resulting in gas-to-particle transformations (Lee Ng et al.
2017; Papapostolou et al. 2013; Hallquist et al. 2009; Jimenez et al. 2009; Kanakidou et al.
2005). The gas-phase reactions, involving oxidants (such as OH radicals, ozone (O3), and
nitrate (NO3) radicals, etc.) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), produce products of
diverse volatility. A large fraction of these products condenses (multiphase process) onto
existing particles (Ylisirniö et al. 2020; Palm et al. 2016). Products having sufficiently lower
volatility than parent VOC can partition into the particle phase directly, forming SOA (Donahue
et al. 2006; Pankow 1994). SOA formation can also occur through aqueous-phase oxidation in

fog and cloud droplets (Choudhary et al. 2024; Ervens 2015; Zhao et al. 2015; Ervens et al.
2011; Lim et al. 2010).
The physicochemical characteristics of POA and SOA are different (Srivastava et al.
2022; Delfino et al. 2010), and thus, there will likely be corresponding differences in toxicity.
So far, most research on cellular toxicity (in vitro) of air pollutants has focused on those directly
emitted into the atmosphere, primarily as POA. In this regard, previous studies reported that
exposure to POA from sources such as wood burning (Wang et al. 2021; McCarthy et al. 2017;
Longhin et al. 2016) and traffic-related activities (Rossner et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021; Pang
et al. 2020; Longhin et al. 2016) can induce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in
human lung cells, resulting in cell damage. The few recent studies (such as Chowdhury et al.
2018) that have investigated the effects of SOA exposure on cells, observed remarkably
enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Controlled human exposures, using
facilities such as the Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory (APEL) (Birger et al. 2011), have also
been based on air pollutants directly emitted from combustion sources (Long et al. 2022; Wu
et al. 2018; Rider et al. 2016; Peretz et al. 2008; Mills et al. 2007; Nordenhäll et al. 2000).
However, these exposures do not fully represent the real-world ambient air pollution
composition, as ambient air exposures are influenced by atmospheric aging, which includes the
formation of SOA. To the best of our knowledge, except for Schuck and Rogers 1959, no study
has used aged air pollution, either from wood burning or traffic-related activities ̶ two primary
sources of particle-rich air pollution globally ̶ during controlled human exposures (Weitekamp
et al. 2020). Schuck and Rogers 1959 found that exposure to UV-irradiated automobile exhaust
causes eye irritation in humans.
Major approaches to studying the SOA formation mechanisms and evolution in the
chemical composition include environmental “smog” chambers and oxidative flow reactors
(OFRs). Environmental chambers have been used extensively to simulate atmospheric

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

oxidation (Yazdani et al. 2021; Weitkamp et al. 2007; Odum et al. 1997). However, recent
studies have highlighted limitations, such as loss of particles and semi-volatile compounds to
chamber walls, especially with longer (> 1 day) residence times (Krechmer et al. 2015, 2016;
Ye et al. 2016; Pathak et al. 2007). Besides these limitations, environmental chambers usually
have large volumes (2 to 256 m3) making them unsuitable for fieldwork and only allow
atmospheric aging equivalent to a maximum of a few days (Wu et al. 2007; Mentel et al. 1996).
OFRs are much smaller (1 L to 1 m3) than environmental chambers (Wu et al. 2023; Xu and
Collins 2021; Huang et al. 2017; Keller and Burtscher 2012; Lambe et al. 2011; Ezell et al.
2010; Kang et al. 2007) and usually employ higher oxidant concentrations, allowing hours to
months of equivalent atmospheric aging in a very short residence time (seconds to minutes),
with reduced wall interactions. Furthermore, the portability of OFRs ensures their applicability
in both laboratory and field studies. However, OFRs can be subjected to unusual aging
reactions compared to the ambient atmosphere, due to different regimes of oxidation processes
(Peng and Jimenez 2020; Peng et al. 2016). OFR design parameters, such as flow profile,
residence time distribution (RTD), wall losses, vapor losses, and oxidation reactions, can
influence these different regimes in OFRs. Regardless of these limitations, OFRs for SOA
formation are well-established, and numerous previous studies have used OFRs to simulate the
formation of SOA from wood smoke (Wu et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2022; Ortega et al. 2013) and
traffic-related emissions (Ihalainen et al. 2019; Simonen et al. 2017) in the laboratory. A few
studies also used OFRs to investigate SOA formation in the ambient atmosphere (Xu and
Collins 2021; Palm et al. 2016).
In the present study, we demonstrate the design and characterization of a new custombuilt OFR called the Fast-oxidation Box (hereafter referred to as FoxBox), devised to achieve
a more realistic air pollution composition for controlled human and cell exposures. FoxBox's
design aimed to ensure a narrow RTD, a short residence time, limited contact of the sample

with reactor walls, and real-time measurements to track physicochemical changes in the
sample. The goal of this work is to test the effectiveness and utility of the FoxBox for
laboratory-based photochemical aging and highlight its potential in furthering our
understanding of how atmosphere-like aging of aerosol may alter molecular signaling pathways
in human lung cells.

2. Experimental
The following experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of FoxBox: (a)
RTD measurements corresponding to CO2, SO2 and particles present in diesel exhaust (DE),
(b) particle transmission efficiency measurements, (c) fates of low-volatile organic compounds
(LVOC) in the FoxBox, including losses to the reactor walls, and (d) measurements of size
distribution, SOA formation, and aerosol mass spectra of DE during OH exposures. In addition,
a case study was carried out to examine the viability of human lung cells after in vitro exposure
to fresh and aged DE. All these experiments were performed with DE particles generated within
our laboratory.
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the experimental setup used in this study. The diesel engine
(Euro-Stage 5 compliant, 4.5kW 1B30E Hatz engine) was used as the source of gases and
particles. The engine produces an exhaust flow of 580 LPM through an engine exhaust line,
most of which is vented to the outdoor atmosphere because it is in excess of what is needed for
our experiments (Birger et al. 2011). A small amount of DE is diluted with HEPA filtered air
and is connected to the booth directly (via a bypass flow pipe) or through the FoxBox. The
amount of DE fed into the booth depends on speed of the exhaust fan controlled at the exit of
the booth. A 3-way valve was placed upstream of the booth and FoxBox to switch flows.
Several gas and particle measurement instruments were operated at the FoxBox exit (point A)
and the booth (point B). The flow rates of DE injections into the FoxBox were controlled at the

exit of the booth by regulating the speed of the exhaust fan (point C) using a remote controller
(thus, we have referred to it as exhaust flow rate in this study). More details about the
experimental setup, such as FoxBox design, experiments carried out for FoxBox
characterization, and instruments used, are discussed in the following sections.
2.1. Description of FoxBox
The FoxBox is a custom-built OFR at APEL, based on the principle of Potential Aerosol
Mass (PAM) (Kang et al. 2007). The FoxBox was constructed using sheets of aluminum alloy,
a conductive and corrosion-resistant material under real-world atmospheric conditions,
including a pH range from 4 to 7 (Kutz 2012). These characteristics inhibit electrostatic losses
in OFRs (Lambe et al. 2011). The reactor is 182.9 cm tall, 61.0 cm deep and 91.4 cm wide. It
has a total volume of 1.019 m3 (1019 L) and a surface-area-to-volume ratio of 2 m-1, much
lower than other operational OFRs, e.g., Caltech (24 m-1) (Huang et al. 2017), TPOT (56 m-1)
(George et al. 2007), and PAM (25 m-1) (Lambe et al. 2011).
The FoxBox houses four pairs of UV lamps (Atlantic Ultraviolet Ster-L-Ray Germicidal
Lamp), as shown in Fig. 1, with each pair equally spaced 42 cm apart and 31 cm separating the
lamps in each pair. Moreover, each pair comprises one 185 and one 254 nm UV lamp. The
lamps are 84 cm long and housed in 91-cm-long Teflon tubes. One pair (Pair I, Fig. 1) of lamps
is wrapped in Teflon tape to decrease the intensities of 185 nm UV-light, compared to 254 nm.
The 185 nm UV-lamps in the FoxBox are responsible for the production of O3 and some OH
whereas the 254 nm lamps dissociate O3 to form an excited-state O atom, which reacts with
H2O to form most of the OH radicals. The production of O3 and OH radicals can be controlled
by regulating UV irradiation (photon flux) inside the FoxBox. To control the extent of UV
irradiation, the four pairs of lamps (3 normal pairs, 1 with Teflon tape) can be activated
independently. A compressed nitrogen gas tank (Praxair) is connected to the reactor, and was

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

used to purge the space around the UV lamps within the Teflon tubes to prevent O3 formation
around the lamps. The purging process also helps to minimize the heat generated by UV lamps,
which warms the OFR walls and the air inside.
2.2. FoxBox residence time distributions
RTDs of gases and particles for the FoxBox were characterized by injecting 20s pulses
of DE into the reactor. DE-derived CO2 and SO2, surrogates for wall-inert and wall-adhering
species, respectively, were used to characterize RTDs of gases, whereas DE particles were used
for the condensed-phase species. Prior to RTD measurements, the FoxBox walls were
passivated with DE until steady concentrations were achieved for the above-mentioned species,
at which time the DE injection into the FoxBox was stopped and the concentrations returned
to near background levels. The flow rates used for RTD measurements were those needed to
maintain a suitable air exchange in the booth during controlled human exposures, which is
crucial for the comfort of the participant (Birger et al. 2011). It is noted that the booth at the
APEL has a total volume of 4760 L (4.76 m3, 121.9 cm wide × 182.9 cm deep × 213.4 cm tall).
Thus, the flow rate of air pollutants (e.g., DE) into the booth was >1300 LPM, providing an air
exchange time of < 3.5 minutes within the booth. As a result, the RTDs were measured at three
flow rates, 1300, 1850, and 2450 LPM in this study, to determine the optimized flow rate for
photochemical aging in the FoxBox (Reynolds number (Re) > 4340, turbulent flow conditions)
and their effect on the FoxBox residence time. CO2, SO2 and optical particle sizer (OPS)derived total particle number concentrations were measured at the immediate FoxBox outlet
(point A in Fig. 1). All experiments were repeated thrice, and the concentrations were
background corrected.

Background corrected RTD measurements were used to determine RTD-weighted mean
time (RTDmean), an approximation of residence time, of the FoxBox using the following
equation (Cao et al. 2020):
1

RTDmean = C × ∑Tt=2(t × Ci,t )

(1)

Ci = ∑Tt=2 Ci,t

(2)

i

where RTDmean is the residence time of FoxBox (s), Ci is the total concentration of species i
(ppbv or cm-3), Ci, t is the concentration of species i at time t (ppbv or cm-3), t is the time at
which Ci is measured, and T is the total time length of the pulse from injection to return to
baseline.
2.3. Particle transmission efficiency
Size-dependent particle transmission efficiencies in the FoxBox were examined using
polydisperse DE particles with mobility diameters of 14.6 to 615.3 nm. Transmission efficiency
was calculated from measurements of particle number size distribution at the inlet and at the
outlet of the FoxBox. The particle number size distribution at the inlet was measured by
switching a steady DE flow directly into the booth (via bypass flow pipe, at point B in Fig. 1),
whereas the measurements at the FoxBox outlet were obtained by switching the DE flow to the
booth chamber via the FoxBox (point B in Fig. 1). Furthermore, the size-dependent particle
transmission efficiency was calculated as the ratio of background-corrected particle number
concentrations measured at the outlet (i.e., via FoxBox) and inlet (i.e., bypass) of the FoxBox.
The transmission efficiency measurements were repeated thrice, each at a steady total particle
number concentration ranging from 50000 to 60000 cm-3. The equivalent PM2.5 concentration
ranged from 35 to 55 µg m-3 (standard deviation was within ±5 µg m-3 for each repetition).
2.4. Chamber wall index (CWI)

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Controlled aging experiments in atmospheric environmental enclosures, such as
environmental chambers, OFRs, etc., are susceptible to wall influence that can alter the aging
chemistry. Many different sizes, shapes, and flow characteristics of enclosures are operational
worldwide (Table S1 of the supplementary file); however, it is very difficult to determine which
enclosure design has less wall influence on the chemistry. Chamber wall index (CWI; Brune
2019) is a simple metric which represents the degree to which the chemistry in an enclosure is
free from unwanted wall effects (e.g., uptake, surface chemistry, etc.) as governed by sampled
gas-phase chemical constituents related to SOA formation. In this study, CWI was determined
using the following equation (Brune 2019):

CWI = A × τ

RTD_mean

where V is the volume of the enclosure (m3), A is the surface area (m2), τRTD_mean is the
weighted-mean residence time (s), Dg is the gas-phase diffusion coefficient of the species (m2
s-1), ke is the eddy diffusion frequency (s-1), δc is the chemical boundary layer depth (m), aw is
the accommodation coefficient for the chemical species on the wall, and ω is the molecular
speed of the chemical species. We have determined the CWI for the FoxBox in this study and
compared it with several other widely used environmental chambers and OFRs worldwide. The
detailed information on V, A, τRTD_mean and δc of these enclosures is shown in Table S1. Dg, aw
and ω values of 5×10-6 m2 s-1, 1 and 180 m s-1 were adopted from previous studies (Brune
2019). The ke was calculated using the following equation (Brune 2019; Krechmer et al. 2016;
Palm et al. 2016):
k e = 0.004 + 10−2.25 × V 0.74
2.5. OH exposure levels

OH exposure (OHexp), indicating OH radical concentration integrated over time, is a key
parameter for interpreting photochemical aging in an OFR. Several previous studies (Wu et al.
2023; Lambe et al. 2011, 2015; Li et al. 2015) have used the decay of SO2 during photochemical
oxidation in the OFR to determine the OHexp levels. In this study, a steady DE flow was
introduced into the FoxBox under distinct UV-light exposures and the decay in SO2 (present in
DE) was monitored at the FoxBox exit (point A as shown in Fig. 1) to quantify OHexp levels.
In total, five different combinations of UV-lamps (Pair I, Pair II, Pairs I+II, Pairs I+II+III, and
Pairs I+II+III+IV lamps) produced distinct UV-light exposures. The measurements were
conducted in triplicates for each UV-light exposure. The following equation was used to
calculate OHexp:
OHexp = k

1
OH_SO2

[SO ]

ln ( [SO2 ]0)
2 f

(5)

where k OH_SO2 is the reaction rate constant of SO2 with OH, and [SO2]0 and [SO2]f are the
concentrations of SO2 before and after photochemical oxidation in the FoxBox, respectively.
The 𝑘𝑂𝐻+𝑆𝑂2 of 9.2 × 10-13 cm3 molec-1 s-1 was used in equation 5 in this study (Peng et al. 2015;
Sander et al. 2011). Furthermore, OHexp was normalized to the daily average OH concentration
to calculate the photochemical age of aged aerosol. We used a daily average OH concentration
of 1.5 × 106 molec cm-3 to convert the OHexp to atmospheric equivalent photochemical age (Mao
et al. 2009).
These photochemical oxidation measurements at different UV-light exposures were
based on a steady DE flow, equivalent to PM2.5 concentration varying from 280 to 350 µg m-3.
The O3, PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), EC, particle number size distribution, and aerosol mass
spectra measured along with SO2 monitoring during the photochemical oxidation. More details
on these measurements are discussed in section 2.7.
2.6. Low-volatile organic compound (LVOC) fates

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

SOA formation as a function of age in OFRs depends on the timescales of distinct
competing processes and their relative importance compared to the atmosphere. During
photochemical oxidation in OFRs, organic vapors (also referred to as VOCs) are oxidized,
forming low-volatility VOCs (LVOCs). These LVOC compounds effectively condense onto
existing particles irreversibly. In the atmosphere, the dominant fate (loss) of LVOCs is
condensation onto particles (atmospheric lifetime of ~ minutes) (Knote et al. 2015; Nguyen et
al. 2015). However, due to different timescales and experimental conditions in OFRs (e.g.,
short residence times of ~ seconds to minutes, high oxidant concentrations, etc.), the LVOCs
formed can have other fates besides condensation onto aerosol (Palm et al. 2016). These other
fates include condensational losses to the surface of OFR walls, further reaction with OH
radicals to produce highly volatile gas-phase products (e.g., CO2), and exiting the OFR in the
gas phase (in that case LVOCs will entirely condense on the sampling tube walls due to the
large surface-area-to-volume ratio). The OFR measurements must be corrected for these other
fates to closely relate SOA formation processes in OFRs, with real atmospheric processes.
In this regard, (Palm et al. 2016) discussed a method to estimate LVOC fates in OFRs,
including condensation onto particles, condensation on the surface of reactor walls, reaction
with OH, and the fraction of LVOC exiting the OFR. In this study, we examined LVOC fates
corresponding to high condensation sink (CS) and low CS scenarios. The high CS scenario (>
3.5×105 s-1) was based on photochemical oxidation of DE at PM2.5 concentrations of 280 to
350 µg m-3, whereas low CS (< 2.0×105 s-1) was based on photochemical oxidation of DE at
PM2.5 of 80 to 100 µg m-3. A detailed description of the method used to estimate LVOC fates
for the FoxBox is given in section S1 of the supplementary file. We also used same method to
estimate LVOC losses for the FoxBox in the absence of CS and oxidants, to determine the
upper limit of LVOC wall losses.
2.7. Gas and particle generation and their monitoring

The production of DE followed a standardized process developed in the APEL (Birger et
al. 2011) to simulate on-road highway conditions. This process includes loading the engine
from idle up to 4kW with increments of 0.5kW at ~5 min intervals, followed by a simulated
cruising condition at 3kW where the engine remains for the duration of the experiment. A small
amount of DE was drawn from the engine tailpipe, diluted, and fed into the booth either directly
or via the FoxBox, as shown in Fig. 1. The exhaust flow rates of DE injections were measured
by a flowmeter (Dwyer, VFC-121) at point C (Fig. 1).
A multitude of instruments were placed at the exit of the FoxBox (point A) and booth
(point B) to monitor the gases and aerosol in DE (Fig. 1). For monitoring gases, CO2 (Thermo
ScientificTM Model 410i), CO (Thermo ScientificTM Model 48i-TLE), SO2 (Thermo ScientificTM
Model 43i), NOx (Thermo ScientificTM Model 42i-LS), and O3 (Thermo ScientificTM Model 49i)
analyzers were used to measure the CO2, CO, SO2, NO/NO2/NOx and O3 concentrations,
respectively. A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) (Rupprecht & Patashnick
Co. Series 1400a) was used to measure PM2.5 mass concentrations. An OPS (TSI Model 3330)
was used to measure total particle number concentration from 0.3 to 10 µm diameter. All the
above-mentioned parameters were measured at two-second intervals. Furthermore, a Graywolf
TG-503 probe, set up within the booth, measured the total VOC (TVOC) concentrations,
temperature and relative humidity (RH, %) at one-minute intervals. A humidifier (Nortec)
maintained sufficient RH (approximately 40%) inside the FoxBox and booth. A scanning
mobility particle sizer (SMPS; TSI Model 3936) measured the number and mass size
distribution of aerosol particles from a mobility diameter of 14.6 to 615.3 nm at a sample flow
rate of 0.3 LPM and a sheath flow rate of 3 LPM. The SMPS consists of two units: an
electrostatic classifier (TSI Series 3080) and a condensation particle counter (TSI Model 3775).
The data from the SMPS were recorded at 3-minute intervals.

A High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF AMS;
Aerodyne) operating in V-mode (DeCarlo et al. 2006; Jimenez et al. 2003) measured the aerosol
mass spectra to look for signs of aerosol aging and SOA formation. Data analysis was
performed using SQUIRREL 1.66G and PIKA 1.26G. Elemental ratios (O:C and H:C) were
determined with the improved ambient method (Canagaratna et al. 2015). A few other wellestablished AMS parameters that were explored included f43 (the fraction of carbon with m/z
43) (Ng et al. 2010), f44 (the fraction of carbon with m/z 44) (Ng et al. 2010), and f57 (the
fraction of carbon with m/z 57). These parameters retrieved from the unit mass data, and
represents all the fragments at m/z 43 (mainly C3 H7+ and C2H3O+)), m/z 44 (mainly CO+
2 ) and
m/z 57 (mainly C4 H9+ and C3H5O+), respectively. All these data were recorded in real-time
during the experiment so that the operator could effectively control the system. Additionally,
eighteen particle-laden quartz filters (Blanks = 3, fresh DE = 3, aged DE = 12) were collected
at the exit of the booth at 10 LPM flow rate using a Harvard impactor, for offline measurements
of EC/OC. EC/OC were measured using the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) 5040 protocol based on thermal optical transmittance on a total carbon
analyzer (Sunset Laboratory Inc.).
2.7. In vitro cell exposure and cell viability measurements
In this study, we used the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 for in vitro exposures.
A detailed description of culture conditions and the exposure system is given in section S2 of
supplementary file. Briefly, cultured A549 cells (initial seeding concentration of 5 × 104
cells/mL), at in lab passages 5-20, were subjected to fresh or aged DE exposures equivalent to
~350 µg m-3 PM2.5 concentration for 1 h using the CULTEX® RFS exposure system
(Aufderheide et al. 2013; Aufderheide 2005). In parallel, identical cells were exposed to lab air
passed through HEPA activated carbon filters (FA). One set of these cells were left within the
incubator (INC) as an additional control. All three sets were collected for each DE exposure.

We repeated each cell exposure (fresh DE and aged DE) twice in triplicate inserts (total six
inserts collected). After each exposure, cell inserts were stored in the incubator at 37°C with
5% CO2 for 24 hours.
After 24 h, DE (fresh and aged) exposed cells and their respective FA and INC controls
were analyzed for cell viability using MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) assays, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma Aldrich).
This method is based on the dissolution of MTT to formazan in the presence of viable cells or
active cellular metabolic activity (Hansen et al. 1989). For MTT assay measurements, firstly,
we prepared the reagent mixture (consisting of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) at a 1
mg/mL concentration in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with calcium chloride and
magnesium chloride (Gibco™, Thermo Fischer Scientific). The apical media was aspirated,
and the cells were washed one time using 100 µL same HBSS solution. Subsequently, 50 µL
of MTT reagent solution was added to each Transwell (apical), and the cells were incubated at
37°C with 5% CO2 for 30 min. After 30 min, the MTT reagent solution was aspirated from the
Transwells. Subsequently, 55 µL of DMSO was added to each well for cell lysis, after which
the Transwells were placed on a shaker until a homogeneous solution was formed. Thereafter,
50 µL of DMSO/cell lysate mixture from each well was transferred onto a 96-well plate, along
with a couple of DMSO-only blanks. The absorbance at 584 nm was measured using a plate
reader (SpectraMax i3x). These absorbance measurements were then used to calculate % cell
viability using the formula:
% cell viability =

AINC

× 100

where Asample indicates absorbance at 584 nm (corrected for blank, DMSO only, absorbance)
for fresh DE, aged DE, and FA exposed cells, and AINC is blank corrected absorbance for
incubator controls.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Residence time distributions (RTDs) of the FoxBox
The RTDs of the FoxBox were experimentally characterized with a wall-inert gas (CO2),
a wall-adhering gas (SO2), and physiochemically heterogeneous (atmospherically relevant) DE
particles, with UV lamps turned off. Figs. 2a and 2b show representative RTDs measured for
CO2 (produced from the engine) and particles with pulsed input (20s) into the FoxBox,
respectively. Fig. S1 in the supplementary file shows RTDs measured with SO2. The same pulse
(of DE) introduced to the FoxBox, as discussed in section 2.2, was used to obtain RTDs for all
these species.
The first result is that the shape and width of the RTDs are all invariant as a function of
flow rates from 1300 to 2450 LPM for CO2 (Fig. 2a), SO2 (Fig. S1), and particles (Fig. 2b).
RTDmean, an approximation of the average residence time of the FoxBox, also reflects these
observations (Table S2). The RTDmean values were 59s, 58s, and 59s measured with CO2, 195s,
187s, and 190s measured with SO2, and 30s, 30s, and 28s measured with particles at 1300,
1850, and 2450 LPM flow rates, respectively (Table S2). The residence times being the same
at the different flow rates may look surprising, as ideally, with the increase in the flow rate, the
air must have moved through the FoxBox faster, reducing the residence time of an individual
molecule/species by the inverse of the mass flow rate. However, as discussed above, the amount
of DE fed into the booth (and FoxBox) depends on the speed of the exhaust fan controlled at
the exit of the booth (point C shown in Fig. 1). We fed a 20s pulse of the DE to the FoxBox.
While the pulse length in time was the same, for a slower flow rate, the pulse length was shorter
in terms of the amount of DE (or length along the tube (pipe) occupied by DE) to which the
flow was added. For higher flow rates, the amount of DE added to the flow was much greater
(a longer length along the tube/pipe occupied by DE). As a result, the amount of time taken to

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

clear the FoxBox is the same for all flow rates. The fact that the residence times were the same
for all flow rates in this study, and that the actual residence time for a molecule depends linearly
on the inverse of the flow rate, suggests that the flow pattern (turbulent flow) inside the FoxBox
does not change substantially at the different flow rates.
The second result is that the RTDs for particles (Fig. 2b) were narrowest, followed by
CO2 (Fig. 2a) and SO2 (Fig. S1) in that order, demonstrating that the particles passed through
the FoxBox more quickly than CO2, with SO2 being the slowest. The average residence time
estimates for particles, CO2, and SO2, were 30s, 58s, and 190s, respectively (Table S2),
consistent with these observations. This difference is plausibly due to either (a) comparatively
poorer mixing of particles into the carrier gas (HEPA filtered air) flow than CO2 and SO2 before
entry into the FoxBox or (b) greater losses of particles to the FoxBox walls (discussed in section
3.2) due to entrainment in eddy currents. Furthermore, RTDs for SO2 were delayed relative to
CO2, as discussed above. The delay indicates enhanced interactions of SO2 with the FoxBox
walls, due to its sticky nature in comparison to CO2. Without wall interactions, RTDs for both
SO2 and CO2 would be expected to be the same. These observations highlight wall effects,
especially on gas-phase precursors, in the FoxBox.
Figs. 3a and 3b show probability distribution functions of residence time for gases (i.e.,
CO2) and particles, respectively. Reporting the RTD measurements as normalized distribution
functions enables the comparison of one OFR’s flow characteristics with others with different
shapes and sizes. RTDs of an idealized device (laminar flow) (Huang et al. 2017) and those
observed or reported for the FoxBox (this study), PAM (Lambe et al. 2011), and CPOT (Huang
et al. 2017) are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b for comparison (PAM Wiki). The residence time
probability distribution function is defined as the normalized measured concentration (Cout (t))
divided by the total area of the normalized pulse (Simonen et al. 2017; Fogler and Gürmen
1999), as given below:

where t is the residence time normalized to the average residence time (RTDmean) of the OFR.
We observed the residence time probability distribution function of CO2 and particles in the
FoxBox OFR, as shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively, resembled those expected for ideal
laminar flow. Yet, the pulses were slightly broader for CO2 compared to laminar flow.
Additionally, both pulses (CO2 and particles) for the FoxBox were similar to PAM and CPOT
(Fig. 3). Previous studies reported that the heat generated by UV lamps can warm up the OFR
walls and enhance convection inside the OFR, which may broaden the RTD (Simonen et al.
2017). However, we did not observe any such effect on RTDs of both CO2 and particles under
UV exposure, compared to when UV turned off (Fig. 3), indicating that the heat generated by
UV lamps had either no, or minimal, effects on the RTDs. Circulation of N2 gas through the
housing around the UV lamps is likely to have minimized convective mixing in the FoxBox by
quickly replacing air surrounding the UV lamps.
3.2. Transmission efficiency of particles
As stated above, particle transmission efficiency is defined as the ratio of the particle
number concentration exiting the reactor to that exiting the bypass flow pipe. The particle
number size distributions of DE exiting the FoxBox and bypass flow pipe are shown in Fig.
S2. Fig. 4 shows the transmission efficiency of DE particles as a function of mobility diameters
ranging from 15 to 615 nm. We observed that the particle transmission efficiency was slightly
lower for smaller sized particles, ~95% for particles < 40 nm (i.e., ~5% loss of < 40 nm
particles). Moreover, particles with a mobility diameter > 40 nm could transmit through the
FoxBox with ~100% efficiency. These observations indicate that particle losses in the FoxBox
are negligible. Thus, no correction of particle losses to the walls is required during
photochemical aging (of DE, wood smoke, etc.) studies in the FoxBox.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

We compared the particle transmission efficiency of FoxBox with other OFRs, such as
CPOT (Huang et al. 2017), TPOT (Lambe et al. 2011), and PAM (Lambe et al. 2011) (Fig. 4).
Monodisperse ammonium sulfate (AS) particles were used to determine particle transmission
efficiency of CPOT, whereas bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (BES) particles were used for the
TPOT and PAM reactors. As shown in Fig. 4, significant particle losses were reported for these
reactors, compared to the FoxBox. For example, both the PAM (Lambe et al. 2011) and CPOT
(Huang et al. 2017) reactors have been reported to undergo significant particle losses not only
for smaller mobility diameters but also for large particles (~20%) with diameters > 100 nm.
For the TPOT reactor, the particle losses at smaller mobility diameters were highest among all
the reactors, whereas losses were similar to CPOT and PAM at larger diameters. The critical
factor behind the almost negligible particle losses found in the FoxBox is the very high flow
rate used (lower residence time = ~30s) for measurements compared to the other reactors (~100
to 600s). Another key factor could be that the FoxBox is made of aluminum alloy sheet,
whereas all the reactors mentioned above are made of glass. In this context, a previous study
(Lambe et al. 2011) has reported that conductive materials (e.g., aluminum) are less prone to
particle losses than glass and all more recent PAM reactors are now coated with aluminum
(Aerodyne 2019).
3.3. Fate of low-volatile organic gases in FoxBox
Earth’s oxidizing atmosphere dictates the fate of thousands of chemically distinct air
pollutants emitted into the atmosphere via several aging processes (e.g., heterogenous OH
oxidation, photolysis, etc.) involving the production of oxidative reactants such as O3, OH
radicals, etc., and SOA. As discussed above, OFRs can simulate the chemical processes
occurring in the atmosphere; however, OFRs are susceptible to wall influences that can alter
the chemistry of these processes. The CWI metric (Brune 2019) indicates the degree to which
the OFR is free from potential unwanted wall losses of gas-phase air pollutants, especially

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

organics which are associated with SOA formation. Overall, the mean CWI values for OFRs
were higher than those for environmental chambers, indicating that walls alter the chemistry
less in OFRs than in environmental chambers (Fig. S3). Furthermore, we found that the CWI
of FoxBox, estimated at ~50, was very high in comparison to all the other OFRs (varying from
~0.5 to 2.5) and environmental chambers (varying from 0.1 to 0.2). These observations signify
that wall losses of gas-phase air pollutants (e.g., semi- and low-volatile VOCs) in the FoxBox
are negligible compared to the existing OFRs and environmental chambers, due primarily to
its lower residence time (~58s) in comparison to the other reactors (~100 to 600s) and
environmental chambers (hours).
The dominant fate of LVOCs in the atmosphere is condensation onto aerosol particles
(Palm et al. 2016; Knote et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2015). However, LVOC fates in the OFR
include condensational losses to the OFR walls, losses due to reaction with OH to produce
highly volatile gas-phase products, and a fraction exiting the OFR in the gas phase (completely
lost to sampling tube walls) along with condensation onto aerosol (Palm et al. 2016). We
estimate the upper limit of LVOC losses to the FoxBox walls in the absence of CS and oxidants
to be around 6%. The FoxBox LVOC losses were significantly lower than those of other OFRs.
The estimated upper limit of LVOC losses was around 20% for the RAAD OFR (Wu et al.
2023), and approximately 30% for the PFA OFR (Xu and Collins 2021). These findings indicate
that the FoxBox is a highly efficient reactor, with negligible susceptibility to gas and particle
losses.
3.4. Photochemical oxidation of DE in the FoxBox: Evolution of physicochemical
characteristics
Photochemical oxidation of DE in the FoxBox was carried out under five different UV
exposure conditions, as discussed in section 2.5. The oxidation process is known to be

influenced by RH conditions in the reactor. Therefore, we maintained nearly consistent RH and
temperature levels of (40 ± 5)% and (24 ± 1)°C, respectively, during the oxidation. The

OFR_Exposures_Estimater_v3.1 (PAM Wiki), was greater than the 0.8% prescribed for safer
(atmospherically relevant) photochemical oxidation (Peng and Jimenez 2020; Peng et al. 2015,
2016). The maximum OHexp achieved was approximately 1×1012 molecules per cubic
centimeter second (molec cm-3 s), equivalent to approximately 8 days of atmospheric aging. It
varied from about 0.2×1012 molec cm-3 s for no output O3 to 1×1012 molec cm-3 s for 600 ppbv
of output ozone (Fig. S4). As 8 days of equivalent photochemical age generally meets the
requirements of most aging experiments, we did not measure the maximum OHexp that can be
produced in the FoxBox.
As discussed earlier, the OHexp calculations in this study were based on SO2 decay
measurements. The OHexp determined by SO2 decay may or may not be a good indicator of
true OHexp. In this context, previous studies (Peng and Jimenez 2020; Richards-Henderson et
al. 2016; Kan et al. 1981) have reported that peroxyl radicals (RO2), primarily form as a result
of a reaction between OH and VOCs in OFRs, can react with SO2. The reaction rate of RO2 +
SO2 depends quadratically on RO2 concentration (Richards-Henderson et al. 2016; Kan et al.
1981). However, the production of RO2 in OFR is limited by the OH oxidation of VOCs (Peng
and Jimenez 2020). In simple words, the RO2 + SO2 reaction would significantly contribute to
SO2 decay only if the OH reactivity of all VOCs (OHRVOC) is very high in OFRs (in the order
of hundreds of s-1) (Peng and Jimenez 2020). In this study, the OHRVOC varied from 27 to 61
(43 ± 17) s-1 (Table S3), indicating a very limited or negligible role of RO2 in SO2 decay. Thus,
SO2 decay observed during photochemical oxidations in FoxBox is likely due to OH radicals
only, signifying the reliability of OHexp calculations in this study.

In addition, we have estimated the fates of LVOC in the FoxBox based on the given OHexp
values under both high and low CS conditions (Fig. S5). We found that at least 99.8% of LVOCs
in the FoxBox were lost due to condensation onto exiting aerosol particles, similar to the actual
atmosphere. The contribution of other fates to LVOC losses was less than 0.2%. All these
observations demonstrate the high suitability of the FoxBox for laboratory-based
photochemical oxidation of air pollutants. The impact of photochemical oxidation of DE in the
FoxBox on its physicochemical characteristics (e.g., particle size distribution, SOA formation,
aerosol mass spectra, etc.) is examined in the following section.
3.4.1. Particle size distribution
Fig. 5 depicts the changes in the SMPS based particle number size distribution of DE
photochemically oxidized in the FoxBox over a range of OHexp levels, from 3.0×1011 to
9.5×1011 molec cm-3 s (equivalent photochemical ages: 2.3 to 7.6 days), compared to fresh DE.
An initial observation of fresh DE revealed a unimodal particle size distribution with a median
size of 119 nm. Distinct bimodal size distributions were observed at different OHexp levels for
aged DE. In fact, the median size of the particulate emissions decreased as OHexp levels
increased, dropping from 119 nm for fresh DE to 48 nm for aged DE at an OHexp of 9.5×1011
molec cm-3 s. This decrease was due to substantial new ultrafine particle formation and their
growth in nucleation mode (from 20 to 50 nm) with increased OHexp levels during
photochemical oxidation. In simpler terms, higher OHexp levels led to an increase in ultrafine
particle concentrations in nucleation mode. Based on previous studies (Akherati et al. 2020),
we believe that the observed nucleation likely resulted from aromatic compounds present in
DE being oxidized under OHexp and rapidly forming SOA.
Additionally, from Fig. 5, we observed that the size of the ultrafine particles (nucleation
mode) largely increased with higher OHexp levels. For instance, the particle diameter in the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

nucleation mode was approximately 25 nm at an OHexp of 3.0×1011 molec cm-3 s, and increased
to about 40 nm at 9.5×1011 molec cm-3 s. The particle diameter in the accumulation mode
increased until an OHexp of 3.0×1011 molec cm-3 s and slightly decreased afterwards. However,
we did not observe nucleation mode in particle mass size distribution, and the mass
concentration and diameter in accumulation mode largely increased with higher OHexp (Fig.
S6). These observations suggest that most of the oxidized VOCs (semi- and low-volatility)
likely condensed onto particles in accumulation mode. In nucleation mode, either less-oxidized
(semi-volatility) VOCs or, a small fraction of low-volatility VOCs or, a combination of both
may have condensed onto the newly formed particles, resulting in a negligible addition to the
mass concentration compared to accumulation mode. These findings are consistent with the
LVOC fate model discussed above, where VOCs rapidly oxidize to semi- or low-volatility
VOCs (at all OHexp levels used in this study) that can condense. Furthermore, the nucleation
observed during photochemical oxidation in FoxBox may not necessarily be representative of
the atmosphere. In this context, previous studies have reported that a higher concentration of
condensable species and oxidants in OFRs favors increased nucleation (Guo et al. 2020; Bruns
et al. 2015). Thus, nucleation mode particles are a common sight in OFR-based studies (Wu et
al. 2023; Zhao et al. 2021; Ihalainen et al. 2019; Simonen et al. 2017; Palm et al. 2016).
3.4.2. Evolution of aerosol mass spectra as a result of SOA formation
To investigate the formation of SOA during photochemical oxidation, the change in PM2.5
and OC mass concentrations (also referred to as PM2.5ER and OCER, respectively) as a result of
OHexp was examined along with AMS measurements. The PM2.5 and OC data were then used
in the following equation to demonstrate SOA formation:
(OC/EC)𝑂𝐻

OCER = (OC/EC) 𝑒𝑥𝑝
fresh

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

(8)

where OCER is the mass enhancement ratio of OC, (OC/EC)OHexp is the background corrected
OC/EC ratio at a given OHexp, and (OC/EC)fresh is the background corrected OC/EC ratio for
fresh (unaged) emissions. PM2.5ER , the mass enhancement ratio of PM2.5, was calculated by
using background corrected PM2.5 mass concentration in equation 8 instead of OC/EC ratio.
Fig. 6 illustrates the changes in PM2.5 and OC concentrations at different photochemical ages
(Fig. 6a) and OHexp levels (Fig. 6b), relative to fresh DE. We observed that the concentrations
of both OC and OA increased with photochemical age and OHexp (Fig. 6 and Fig. S7,
respectively), indicating formation of SOA during photochemical oxidation in FoxBox. OCER
increased from 1.3 ± 0.1 at an OHexp of (1.9 ± 0.2)×1011 molec cm-3 s to 1.6 ± 0.1 at an OHexp
of (7.0 ± 0.5)×1011 molec cm-3 s (corresponds to photochemical age of 1.5 and 5.4 days,
respectively) (Fig. 6).
The OA concentration-based mass enhancement ratio was higher, increased from ~1.5 at
an OHexp of 1.9×1011 molec cm-3 s to ~3.5 at an OHexp of approximately 7×1011 molec cm-3 s,
than OCER (Fig. S7). This difference between the ratios was likely due to comparatively higher
enhancement in organic mass (OM) than OC during OH exposure (Hayes et al. 2013).
−
Furthermore, the mass concentrations of NH4+ , SO−
4 , and NO3 also increased with OHexp (Fig.

S7a-b). The highest increment was observed in NO3− concentration (9 to 26 times) followed by
NH4+ (3 to 16 times) and S0−
4 (1 to 2 times) (Fig. S7c). Despite a wide variability in mass
enhancement ratios of different constituents of PM2.5 as discussed above, the overall PM2.5ER
was similar to OCER (Fig. 6), probably because a dominant fraction (~60 to 70%) of PM2.5 in
fresh DE is refractory in nature and non-refractory fraction is predominantly OA (Fig. S7a).
These observations ascertain that the photochemical oxidation process leads to the secondary
formation of aerosol, particularly SOA. Previous studies have also reported comparable mass
enhancement ratios (~1.3 and 1.5) for biomass-burning derived organic aerosol after

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

approximately 3 and 5 days of photochemical aging in the RAAD (Wu et al. 2023), and the
PAM (Ortega et al. 2013) OFR, respectively.
To investigate the chemical transformations of DE resulting from SOA formation during
photochemical oxidation, aerosol mass spectra were monitored using an AMS. While the mass
spectrum of fresh DE comprised almost all ions (CxHx) that are characteristics of hydrocarbons
(e.g., C3 H7+ , C4 H9+ , etc.) (Fig. S8a), substantial changes (such as enhanced signal for ion types
that are characteristics of oxidation (CxHxO, CxHxO2+)) were observed (e.g., C2H3O+, CO+
2 , etc.)
in the mass spectrum of aged DE (Fig. S8b).
To further evaluate chemical transformation during photochemical oxidation, we
examined fraction of certain well-established AMS-derived organic fragment (ion type) signals
(m/z) to the total OA mass (fm/z). f43 (C3 H7+ ) and f57 (C4 H9+ ) are commonly employed as proxies
for freshly emitted hydrocarbon-like OA (Rajeev et al. 2022; Cubison et al. 2011; Ng et al.
2011). In addition, f43 (C2H3O+) is also commonly used as a proxy for fresh SOA or less
oxidized OA (Rajeev et al. 2022; Cubison et al. 2011; Ng et al. 2011). On the other hand, f44
(CO+
2 ) represents greater oxidation (Rajeev et al. 2022; Cubison et al. 2011; Ng et al. 2011). In
Fig. 7, f44 is plotted against f43 (Fig. 7a) and f57 (Fig. 7b) as a function of OHexp levels. We
found an increase in f44 and a decrease in f43 and f57 consistently with higher OHexp levels. The
f44 for fresh DE varied from 0.01 to 0.02 and f43 varied from 0.10 to 0.12. Upon photochemical
oxidation, the f44 values consistently increased, and f43 decreased with higher OHexp levels
(~0.04 and ~0.07, respectively, at OHexp = 9.5×1011 molec cm-3 s) (Fig. 7a). Furthermore, f57
fraction decreased from ~0.11 for fresh DE to ~0.03 for aged DE (Fig. 7b).
A few previous studies (Ihalainen et al. 2019; Presto et al. 2014) have looked at
photochemical oxidation of DE in an OFR and an environmental chamber. In OFR, f44
increased from 0.08 to 0.15, whereas f43 remain unchanged at ~0.07 at OHexp of 8×1011 molec

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

cm-3 s (Ihalainen et al. 2019). In the environmental chamber, the f44 increased from 0.04 to 0.15
and the f43 values decreased from ~0.08 to 0.04 at OHexp of 5.4×1010 molec cm-3 s (Presto et al.
2014). Summarily, the values of f43 and f44 observed in this study may look different from
previous studies as discussed above, but, overall, the f43 and f44 values observed (or reported)
in this study for fresh DE were similar to ambient hydrocarbon-like OA (f43: 0.06 to 0.12; f44:
0.01 to 0.04), whereas the values for aged DE were similar to ambient semi-volatile oxygenated
OA (f43: 0.06 to 0.15; f44: 0.02 to 0.14) (Ng et al. 2011). We also examined evolution in
elemental ratios of DE particles to follow oxygenation as a function of OHexp levels in FoxBox,
as shown in the Van Krevelen diagram (H:C versus O:C) in Fig. S9 of the supplementary file.
The O:C ratio for fresh DE was ~0.07 and increased to ~0.19 for OHexp of 1.9×1011 molec cm3

s and ~0.23 for OHexp of (7.4 to 9.5)×1011 molec cm-3 s. These O:C values for photochemically

aged DE from FoxBox were similar to ambient semi volatility oxygenated OA (varied from 0.1
to 0.6) (Ng et al. 2011); however, they were lower than O:C values reported for low volatility
oxygenated OA (varied from 0.4 to 1.0) from OHexp of (3 to 10)×1011 molec cm-3 s by previous
ambient (Ng et al. 2011) and DE-based OFR (Lambe et al. 2012) studies.
This difference is likely due to the high mass loadings (280 to 350 µg m-3 fresh DE) used
during photochemical oxidation in FoxBox, and as a result, even high volatility (low O/C)
species could condense. Most species (VOCs) condensing were likely semi volatility rather
than low volatility, resulting in the lower O:C values during OHexp of DE in FoxBox. Moreover,
the Van Krevelen slope for photochemical oxidation of DE in FoxBox varied from -1.6 to -1.8
and was comparable to Van Krevelen slopes reported in ambient atmosphere (including urban
atmosphere enriched with vehicular pollution) (-0.8 to -1.1) (Roig Rodelas et al. 2019; Hayes
et al. 2013; Heald et al. 2010). These observations and the consistency of the trend of changes
in f43 and f44 during photochemical oxidation in FoxBox with other OFRs, environmental
chambers, and ambient data (discussed above) indicate the atmospheric relevance of the

observations. Overall, this study of DE indicates that the FoxBox can simulate atmospherically
relevant photochemical oxidation comparable to other OFRs and environmental chambers.
3.5. Cell viability of freshly emitted versus photochemically aged DE
In vitro cell exposure studies are helpful in anticipation of the integration of the FoxBox
into human exposure studies. Preliminary findings from such exposures are discussed herein,
focusing on cell viability, with additional details of effects at lower mass concentrations
forthcoming in future publications. Thus, these cellular studies are preliminary to the suite of
tests necessary before human studies can proceed. Cell viability measures the proportion of
live and healthy cells within a population. A549 cells were exposed to freshly emitted and
photochemically aged DE at an OHexp of 7.4×1011 molec cm-3 s (atmospheric equivalent
photochemical age: 5.7 ± 0.4 days) in this study. Fig. 8 shows the % cell viability (relative to
INC controls) after exposure to FA, fresh DE, and photochemically aged DE. The cell viability
for FA (HEPA and activated carbon filtered room air) at ~97% was very similar to INC, as
envisaged. The cell viability for fresh diesel exhaust was only slightly lower at 93%; however,
for photochemically aged DE was much lower at 29% (Fig. 8).
A nonparametric t-test (unpaired) was used to statistically compare the cell viability of
FA, fresh DE, and photochemically aged DE with INC controls. The difference in cell viability
after photochemically aged DE exposures was significant (p < 0.0001), whereas no significant
difference was identified for fresh DE. This is intriguing considering that the PM2.5
concentrations were very similar during fresh (339 ± 18 µg m-3) and photochemically aged DE
(357 ± 10 µg m-3) exposures. PM2.5 is well known to be a major contributor to air pollutionassociated adverse health effects. In this context, a recent study (Chowdhury et al. 2018) also
reported that the cell viability of A549 cells decreases upon exposure to aged naphthalene- and
α-pinene-derived SOA compared to fresh naphthalene and α-pinene SOA. Similar findings

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wwt9k ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-2737 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

have been obtained for toluene SOA as well (Yu et al. 2017). Thus, the chemical changes within
PM2.5, notably the formation of SOA (ultrafine particles) due to photochemical aging, are likely
responsible for decreased cell viability.
However, photochemical aging also changed the fresh gaseous composition, suggesting
that photochemically produced gases could also decrease cell viability. Particularly, NO
decreased from 3716 ± 160 ppbv to 660 ± 107 ppbv, but NO2 increased from 532 ± 44 ppbv to
2665 ± 43 ppbv, and O3 increased from 22 ± 3 ppbv to 177 ± 32 ppbv (Table S4). In one study,
2500 ppbv of NO2 exposure decreased viability of A549 cells to about 90% (Bakand et al.
2007). In another, 400 ppbv of O3 exposure decreased cell viability to about 88% (Kosmider et
al. 2010). These studies indicate that little of our observed decrease in cell viability is likely
due to gas-phase NO2 and O3 and is primarily due to aged PM2.5 or could be due to co-exposure
(synergistic) effects. The cell viability will be checked for gases (filtering air pollution sample
through HEPA), particles, and their whole mixture (gas + particles) separately in the next
FoxBox experiments to determine their individual and co-exposure effects (if any).

4. Conclusions and implications for environmental respiratory research
This study introduces the FoxBox, a large oxidative flow reactor at the Air Pollution
Exposure Laboratory, and diagnoses its ability to simulate atmospheric aging of DE. It is
capable of OH exposures up to 1012 molec cm-3 s, which is equivalent to almost 8 days in the
atmosphere, with a flow rate 1300 to 2450 LPM that is necessary for eventual human exposure
experiments. Its short residence times for gases and particles results in almost 100%
transmission of particles of mobility diameters between 15 nm and 615 nm. The changes in DE
particle size distributions and chemical composition with photochemical aging are consistent
with those observed in the atmosphere and in other oxidative flow reactors. Thus, we have
demonstrated that the FoxBox is capable of simulating, in a few minutes, many, if not most, of

the characteristics of DE aging in the atmosphere, signifying its suitability and applicability for
aerosol aging studies in the APEL.
The vast majority of the global population is regularly exposed to levels of gases and
PM2.5 exceeding WHO guidelines. It is noted that the chemical and physical characteristics of
air pollutants change when they are transported long distances from their source locations to
faraway locations due to atmospheric chemical processes, such as photochemical oxidation.
Our preliminary study on cell viability found that photochemical aging significantly reduced
cell viability, supporting observations that communities distant from air pollution sources are
affected and vulnerable.
Controlled human exposure studies are a critical part of the set of interdisciplinary tools
required to establish plausibility for the negative health effects of DE and other pollutant
particles (Carlsten and Georas 2014). Yet the effects of inhaling more realistic photochemically
aged aerosol particles has rarely been studied in controlled human exposures. This situation is
concerning, especially given the potential of underappreciated health effects for communities
exposed to photochemically aged particles. We contend that the integration of the FoxBox with
a controlled human exposure system, albeit after a sufficient suite of tests at lower mass
concentrations (to allow for a margin of safety) in our next set of in vitro experiments, will help
address these concerns.

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the experimental setup used in this study. The engine produces a
large amount of exhaust through an engine exhaust line, most of which is unnecessary for
experiments and thus, vented to the outdoor atmosphere. A small portion of diluted diesel
exhaust (DE) was fed into the booth directly (via the bypass flow pipe) and via the FoxBox,
with a 3-way valve placed upstream to switch flows. A number of gas and particle monitors
were operated at the FoxBox exit (point A) and booth exit (point B). Point C is the location
where exhaust flow rates were measured.

2017), as a function of normalized residence time for: (a) CO2, and (b) particles. Here, DE is
diesel exhaust, AS is ammonium sulphate (AS), and BES is bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (BES)
particles. The FoxBox comparison was performed for both UV on (w/ UV) and UV off (w/o
UV) conditions.

Fig. 4. Comparison of particle transmission efficiency of the FoxBox (this study) with CPOT
(Huang et al. 2017), TPOT (Lambe et al. 2011) and PAM (Lambe et al. 2011) reactors. The
particle transmission efficiency of the FoxBox was based on diesel exhaust (DE), CPOT on
ammonium sulphate (AS), and TPOT and PAM on bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (BES) particles.
Error bars represent standard deviations. Pink dashed line corresponds to when all the particles
are transmitted through the reactor.
