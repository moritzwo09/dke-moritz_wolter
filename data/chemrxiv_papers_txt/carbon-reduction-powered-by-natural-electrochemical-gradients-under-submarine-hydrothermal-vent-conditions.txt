ABSTRACT: Energy metabolism at the emergence of life has been the topic of intense theoretical and experimental study. Alkaline
hydrothermal vents (AHVs) may have facilitated energy-transfer and carbon-fixation at life’s emergence, via a primordial
chemiosmotic mechanism. Specifically, pH separation across vent walls could have been the forerunner to pH separation across
microbial membranes, with electron-conductive inorganic barriers containing [Ni-]FeS minerals mimicking the active sites of
metalloenzymes in potentially ancient biological reductive acetyl-CoA Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, reverse Krebs and other
metabolic pathways. We previously demonstrated pH gradient dependent reduction of CO 2 to formate by H2 in AHV interface
conditions. Here, we address the same problem of CO2 reduction, however using a macroscale reactor that allowed us to use minerals
synthesized via protocols analogous to the alkaline vent mount formation. This reactor also allowed us to probe more variables, and
explore longer experimentation time-frames. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the effect of the different aspects of the gradientrich hydrothermal-vent interface on the observed CO2 electrochemical reduction- such as different minerals, temperature gradients,
as well as the flow of electrons under passive vs. induced currents and potentials. Using experimental simulations and
electrochemistry techniques, We detected two key steps of the WL pathway (CO 2 to formic acid, and the formation acetic acid) as
well as reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (fumarate to succinate). Both Ni in the mineral, and temperature as a property, were
shown to affect the formation of formate. Extremely small currents were enough to efficiently carry out CO 2 reduction. This work
develops benchmarks to electrochemically explore the model of protometabolisms in the vent-ocean interface and opens to future
analyses on the catalytic or electrocatalytic properties of Fe-[Ni-]S minerals as precursors of metalloenzymes.

INTRODUCTION: The hydrothermal-vent interface of
early submarine vent systems has long been proposed as a
hatchery for the emergence of early bioenergetic processes.1,2
This model is based on the mechanism of chemiosmosis, or
vectorial electrochemistry,3–5 which describes an energy
conversion mechanism, universal in known modern cells. In
that cell mechanism, exergonic and endergonic processes are
coupled using natural electrochemical gradients, resulting from
the pH and redox gradients, as drivers to chemical reactions,
mediated by membrane-located molecular machines, or
enzymes.6 This energy conversion system is considered as
universal and antique as the genetic code in known living
systems.7,8 In a model of early cell metabolism, a key step for
emergence includes the reduction of the oceanic CO2 by
serpentinization-derived H2 mediated by vent minerals, in a
prebiotic analogy to the reductive acetyl Coenzyme A (also

known as Wood-Ljunghdahl pathway; WL).9,10 From this
context, we investigate the first steps for the emergence of key
metabolism for life. We focus here on models of prebiotic
pathways based on the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway and on
the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. Both are
considered key protometabolism for the early phases of
biochemical evolution involving Acetyl-CoA an highlyreactive and energy-rich molecule.10–12
In environments with alkaline vents, this model for the
emergence of bioenergetics offers pH and electrochemical
gradients as driving forces for proto-biological processes,
facilitated by the interface between hydrothermal fluids and the
primitive ocean (which we will refer to as early vent-ocean
interface). Vent efflux of moderate temperature (~70ºC),
moderate reducing potential and alkalinity (pH ~9), juxtaposed

with the cold, acidic oceanic fluids, percolate a labyrinth of
micropores in the mineral precipitate (predominantly formed by
carbonates) that mediate the interface.13 The mechanism of
catalysis proposed is by minerals composed of iron and sulfur
(Fe-S minerals) or iron oxyhydroxides (green rusts)—both
plausible on early Earth in the context of hydrothermal
vents.9,14,15 Clusters of Fe-S and iron oxides are considered
precursors of important enzymes for carbon transduction and
fixation processes, such as the case of the WL pathway.
The WL pathway depends, like other cellular processes, on
a proton gradient for the reduction of CO2 by molecular
hydrogen using iron center proteins in the active site of enzymes
working at the intersection of membranes, such as ferredoxin.
Thioesters, such as Acetyl-CoA, are extremely important in
prokaryotic metabolisms such as methanogens and acetogens,
in transduction pathways without the participation of ATP or
any other triphosphate.16–18 Furthermore, CO2 is a component of
relative abundance in the primitive ocean, and H2 is a product
of serpentinization reaction.19,20 Given the universality of the
Acetyl-CoA pathway, such metabolism may have already
existed in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).17,21,22
The initial and limiting step of this metabolism, the formation
of formic acid from CO2, was recently demonstrated in the
laboratory in the absence of enzymes, using the mediation of
metallic samples, and under hydrothermal conditions.22
The emphasized variant of the submarine alkaline vent
theory (SAVT) has already guided experimental works that
explored the proposed requisite mechanisms of early energy
conversion.23–26 Recently, We recently demonstrated CO2
reduction to formate by H2, which is the first and limiting step
of WL pathway, using microfluidic setups under the conditions
of the early vent-ocean interface.27,28
These microfluidc studies elucidated important aspects of a
possible carbon-fixation mechanism hosted in the early
hydrothermal-vent interface. Specifically, they suggest an
indirect electrochemical coupling of the CO2 reduction process
with H2 oxidation that occur on different sides of the inorganic
barrier. Herein, to better probe the mechanism, we employ
macroscale reactors in our examination not only for CO2
reduction to formate, but also the first C-C bond forming step
in the production of acetic acid. Thus, we aimed to simulate
different conditions estimated to exist in a gradient-rich early
alkaline vent scenario and investigate the effects of those
variables on the limiting key steps of the Acetyl-CoA pathway
using FeS minerals. The effect of the presence of Ni in the
mineral structure, the thermal gradient and the occurrence of
different passive and induced electrical currents were tested in
order to better understand how those conditions might have
contributed to CO2 fixation at early hydrothermal-vent
interfaces. Beyond CO2 fixation, we also focused on other
anabolic reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (which in
contemporary systems the WL pathway feeds into). Such
reverse Krebs cycle reactions are also expected to have
succeeded the WL pathway at the onset of life and it has
previously been demonstrated in geologically plausible batch
conditions.29–31 We showcase reactions from the reverse Krebs

cycle (fumarate reduction to succinate) by the indirect, gradient
induced electroreduction in a separated cell reactor. Moreover,
we also investigate the structure and composition of FeS
minerals formed by co-precipitation used in a variety of
microfluidic protocols.28,32–35 Finally, the macroscale reactor
used in this study enables electrochemical monitoring, allowing
us to probe the electron-transfer mechanism for the redox
reactions involving CO2 and H2 mediated by the mineral
interface.
METHODS:

Materials and solutions preparation. All solutions were
prepared with high purity water (Milli-Q system, 18.2 MΩ.cm)
and with reagent grade chemicals. The main electrolytes used,
the vent analog and ocean analog fluids, was based on works
form literature (Table S1). 9,28,32 For saturation of solutions, CO2
and H2 gases (purity: 99.99%) were used.
Synthetic minerals preparation. For the synthesis of
FeS and Ni-FeS, a co-precipitation method, also based on the
literature,9,28,32 was used. In this work, mineral-formation fluids
(Table S1) were mixed in a 1:1 proportion to form the
precipitates of Fe-S and Ni-Fe-S minerals. Then, the resulting
suspension was separated by centrifugation and the precipitated
mineral paste was used as an electron-conductive ink painted
onto Fe electrodes.
Synthetic minerals analyses. The synthesized minerals
were characterized via powder x-ray diffraction (p-XRD), and
x-ray fluorescence (XRF).
Experimental setups. For experiments investigating the
pH and redox gradient driven CO2 reduction mediated by
different minerals and the effect of thermal gradient, we used a
two-chamber glass reactor with separated water jackets and
capacity of 250 mL in each chamber (Figure S1). For simulating
the vent-ocean interface, a vent analog fluid and an early ocean
analog were used as electrolytes. Natural pyrite pieces or Fe
pieces painted with a mineral ink were mediating the interface
in contact of both fluids simultaneously. Moreover, an external
electron-conductive wire connected both pieces immersed in
the electrolytes. An ion-exchange membrane (Nafion 212),
pretreated in 0.1 M NaOH, separated the two chambers for ionic
equilibration during experiments.
For analyzing thermal-gradient effects, the two-chamber
glass reactor was used, with separate temperature control for the
two compartments (vent/ocean: 75˚C/75˚C; 75˚C/5.5˚C;
5.5˚C/5.5˚C).
In order to directly electrochemically monitor the system
with a potentiostat, we used a smaller reactor with a shorter
distance between electrodes, and thus less resistivity overall.
This two chamber PTFE reactor had a 20-mL capacity and a
magnetic stirrer in the ocean side (Figure S3). The same
electrolytes, ion exchange membrane and minerals used with
the large glass reactor were used here. For these experiments we

chose several fixed voltage (-0.5V and -2V), as well as an
‘expected’ current (10 nanoamperes; based on the resistivity of
the system, and the potential difference) and a greater 10
microampere current.
In order to explore the capacity for the separated cell system
to enable the reduction of other organics, we used a similar twochamber PTFE reactor with a 20 mL capacity. On the vent side,
we used the same alkaline vent efflux solution described above
(with a hydrogen balloon), and on the ocean side, the electrolyte
was KI, with fumarate as the reactant, and rather than CO2 gas
(we used a balloon of N2 so as to eliminate the possibility for
competing organic reductions.
For all the experiments described, the organic aqueous
product analyzes were performed via proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H-NMR) and 13C NMR.
RESULTS:

Synthetic minerals analyses. The process of bulk
precipitation for mineral formation is estimated to be analogous
to the one that occurs in hydrothermal vent system resulting in
its typical porous inorganic barriers that form the vent
mounts.36–38 The XRD analyses of those minerals showed the
typical profile from amorphous or nanocrystaline structures
(see Supplementary material), likely due to the formation of
several phases simultaneously. XRF (Fig. S4) suggests similar
stoichiometric ratios of metal (Fe or Fe/Ni) to S present in the
precipitated minerals.
Organics formation mediated by different [Ni-]FeS
minerals. Screening of various minerals in the glass cell
reactor indicated that FeS, Ni-FeS, and FeS2 all produced short
chain carboxylic acids in μM concentrations on the ocean side
of the reactor at 25˚C (Table 1, entries 1-3), while none was
detected on the vent side (Table 1, entry 4). This suggests that
rather than gases or organic molecules passing between
chambers, that there is instead an indirect electrochemical
mechanism whereby H2 is oxidized on the ‘vent’ side of the

reactor, electrons pass through the mineral, and reduce organics
on the ‘ocean’ side of the reactor. Single-pot blank reactions—
[Ni-]FeS minerals with CO2 gas (Table 1, entry 5), and no
mineral with CO2 and H2 (Table 1, entry 6)—offered neither
formic acid nor acetic acid. This suggests that under ambient
temperature (~22-25°C) and anoxic condition the mineral
cannot be significantly sacrificially oxidized as the source of
electrons for CO2 fixation, and nor can CO2 & H2 together effect
such reactions in the absence of an electrocatalyst.
In general, Ni-FeS mineral mediating the vent-ocean
interface resulted in roughly similar yields of formic acid, as
occur to gas products shown in the work of Yamaguchi et al.,
(2014).5 The same pattern was also detected to occur on acetic
acid formation.

Effects of the thermal gradient. Adapting the reactor
setup (Figure S1b), we screened the effect of temperature on
both chambers. With both chambers at 75˚C, formic and acetic
acid were observed in appreciable quantities (Table 2, entry 1),
whereas when both chambers were cooled to 6˚C, none was
detected (Table 2, entry 2). Under a temperature-gradient
scenario similar to Hadean vent models, the yields for formic
acid and acetic acid (Table 2, entry 3) nearly matched the allhot tests. Coupled with the all hot (slightly higher organic
formation) and all cold (no products detected) tests, the
temperature gradient results suggest that higher temperatures on
the vent side increase the rate of H2 oxidation (the reaction
cannot proceed with a ‘cold’ vent side). The ocean side can be
either ‘hot’ or ‘cold’, and still produce significant short chain
carboxylic acids. Perhaps the thermodynamic effect of
temperature reduction on the ocean side is countered by kinetic
advantage of increased concentrations of CO2 at colder
temperatures.
Current control and second protometabolic step. To
simulate and investigate specific electrochemical conditions on
the vent-ocean interface, experiments were performed in the

range of conditions that is expected to exist in natural scenarios.
A series of potentiostat-induced experiments were conducted
under two conditions under fixated current (Table 3): -10 nA
(nanoamp), and -10 μA (microamp). The magnitude of
nanoamp was estimated to be the same of the spontaneouscondition experiment (Fig S2b). We also tested two conditions
under fixated voltage: -500 mV and -2.0 V (Table 4). Hundreds
of millivolts is a range that is also detected on natural
hydrothermal systems and is estimated to have existed in early
hydrothermal scenarios.39,40 All the referred conditions were set
considering the mineral in the ocean side as the working
electrode.
Ni-FeS showed higher organic product formation and
overall faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction at same
electrochemical conditions than FeS (Figures S4 and S5). We
also detected that under nanoamp current, the faradaic
efficiencies were much higher for the organic production,
mainly for Ni-FeS. That indicates that Ni atoms enhanced the
interaction of mackinawite with CO2 for its electrochemicallyinduced reduction, as shown in other works,41,42 and how
specific currents, not necessarily the higher ones, may result in
better efficiencies. For acetic acid formation, Ni-FeS shows a
higher performance on mediating its formation. However,
under condition of a fixed voltage of -500 mV (Table 4, entries
1 and 3), we see a different pattern, where FeS shows higher
capacity to form formic and acetic acid. That altered pattern was

entries 2 and 4).

sensitive to O2 and to electrochemical conditions.13 A specific
mineral phase or cluster may have facilitated the formation of
acetic acid. Moreover, the experimentation here was performed
in a specific type of reactor that was designed to simulate the
vent-ocean interfacial electrochemical conditions and the long
period of residence for the experiments may also be the reason
for the detection of acetic acid. Besides that, different phases
show more stability under different potential, and some of those
may prevail after the 12 hours of experiments, which can
explain the different pattern observed under – 500 mV.
Notably, small amounts of organics were detected in the
experiment performed in thermodynamically spontaneous
conditions under no external electrochemical induction (Table
3, entries 5 and 6). In this experiment, two mineral-coated iron
pieces are directly connected by an electron-conductive wire,
without the mediation of the potentiostat (Figure S2b), thus only
pH and redox gradients are acting. The fact that the formic acid
and acetic acid yields in these spontaneous conditions are
closest to those with an applied nanoamp current, suggests that
in this passive system, a nanoamp current may be all that is
passing through the mineral mediators.

Fumarate reduction to succinate. Beyond CO2
reduction, we were interested in the ability of the separated cell
reactor to facilitate other metabolic reductions (Table 5). We
therefore explored the reduction of fumarate to succinate under
similar conditions as those used above for CO2 fixation.
Blank reactions (where the mineral electrodes in the
separate compartments were not connected) did not result in any

observed succinate product. Likewise, reactions conducted with
a weak vent electrolyte solution formed little to no product. FeS,
FeS2 and Ni-FeS facilitated the reaction in moderate yield (517%), whereas a bare Fe electrode produced very little
succinate (1%). The lack of reactivity without electrodes
connected indicates that sacrificial oxidation43 of the mineral in
the ocean side is not reducing enough to drive the conversion of
fumarate to succinate in that ocean chamber; instead fumarate
reduction must be coupled to H2 oxidation on the vent side (so
without an electrical connection between these chambers, this
reduction cannot occur). Additionally, the lack of reactivity
with a dilute vent electrolyte suggests the role of sulfide as an
important reducing agent in addition to H2 gas as well as the
role of the electrolyte in charge mobility through the aqueous
medium. The yields for fumarate reduction with the full
strength electrolyte (5-17%) are on par with those demonstrated
in a single-pot reaction for Fe/Ni minerals & metals,25 although
this is the first such demonstrated case of fumarate reduction
where the H2 provided is not oxidized in the same chamber, but
instead it’s oxidation is electrochemically coupled across a
mineral electrocatalyst.

modeled in the SAVT and evidenced by experimental works,
there are reactions that are coupled on both sides of that
interface and those can be independently affected by the local
temperature on each side of the interface. The two reactions are
represented below:
𝑘 𝐶𝑂 (𝑎𝑞) + 𝑛(𝐻 + 𝑒 ) ⇄ 𝑃 + 𝑚 𝐻 𝑂 (𝑙)
{P= HCOOH, CH3COOH, HCHO}
𝐻 (𝑎𝑞) + 2 𝑂𝐻 (𝑎𝑞) ⇄ 2 𝐻 𝑂 (𝑙) + 2 𝑒
In the early vent-ocean interface, both reactions are coupled
and mediated by an inorganic electron-conductive [Ni-]FeS
mineral. Figure 1 shows the result of an analytical model
inspired by the works of Herschy et al.9 and Ooka et al.25
adapted to the context of the early vent-ocean interface. Based
on that result, it is clear that thermodynamics becomes more
favorable when there is a higher temperature gradient, as it
increases the potential of both coupled reactions.

The effect of thermal gradient for the energy
protometabolism at early hydrothermal systems. Thermal
gradients are known to exist in modern cellular systems, besides
that is still under debate how crucial they are or their exact
function for life. There is the example of the mitochondrial
membrane where a 10˚C-gradient was detected.44,45 Under
interface conditions, the thermal gradient results in
electrochemical potential, the well-known Seebeck
effect/voltage. The potential generated from that effect is
usually considered irrelevant, as it generally ranges from μV to
hundredths of mV per Kelvin. On the other hand,
thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of chemical reactions
hosted in an interface region may be also considerably affected
by temperature gradients. In the vent-ocean interface as

The model that resulted in figure 1 illustrates the overall
thermodynamic advantage that the thermal gradient may
promote. On the other hand, there is evidence of the vent-ocean
interface kinetics from the results of the all-cool and all-hot
experiments. While, under low temperatures, H2 and CO2 gases
are expected to be more soluble and the high concentration can
increase the thermodynamic parameters, however, it can also
decrease the reaction rates. Nevertheless, the reaction rates are
expected to increase at higher temperatures, although the gas
concentrations decrease. Thus, the organic formation detected
under the all-hot conditions in higher concentration even
compared to the experiments under thermal-gradient conditions
and the fact that there were no organics under “all-cool”

should prevail in the modeled system.

Outcomes for the emergence of life model in early
AHV systems. Modern hydrothermal systems show natural
electrical current and local reducing condition on its surface that
also shows different potential and current at different
regions.39,40,49 Models of early alkaline hydrothermal systems
also showed how electrochemical parameters might be sensitive
to the early ocean local composition and consequently to the
mineral barrier composition.50 Here, we demonstrated how the
Ni-FeS mineral formation condition in the alkaline
hydrothermal systems results in a mixture of phases that cannot
be easily identified. Under different surface potentials, [Ni-]FeS
minerals can also change their prevailing phases, as shown in
recent experimental works, which may promote the formation
of a metal phase.1151–53
The gradient-rich along with the diversity of phases in the
vent-ocean interface may be a key factor that makes the AHV
scenario into a hatchery for life on early Earth, as envisioned in
several works.12,54–56 As concluded from the discovery of
lamellar distribution of minerals in black smokers, with the
inner layer dominated with chalcopyrite contacting
hydrothermal fluid while the outside layer dominated with
Pyrite (FeS2) and sphalerite (Zn, Fe)S, and contacting the sea
water. Inside that structure, the mineral layers are composed of
pyrrhotite (FeS), pyrite and sphalerite. Such example of
gradient structure is expected to affect the catalytic property at
that submarine vent scenario.57

As shown here, after a period of hours, both formic acid and
acetic acid are present in detectable concentrations under ventocean interface conditions. This indicates the possibility that at
least two protometabolic steps could occur in the early ventocean interface, as illustrated in Figure 2. The variation of
electrochemical conditions expected to exist on early
hydrothermal systems, summed with the variation of Ni-FeS
mineral phases does not compromise the occurrence of those
protometabolic steps, but seems to only affect the accumulation
of formic acid, probably due to the kinetics of the first step.
Moreover, we can expect that another factor can change the
production of formic acid in that interface: the thermal
insulation of the inorganic barrier. As shown here, warmer
temperature on both sides of the vent-ocean interface
contributes to higher rates of the CO2 electrochemical
reduction. This condition is expected to occur when thermal
insulation is low enough, which can occur in regions of the vent
system with thin barriers or closer to regions where
serpentinization is occurring. On the other hand, on distant
regions or where there is low serpentinization activity, thus
cooler temperatures, very little CO2 reduction can be expected,
despite the presence of natural electrochemical gradients. In
cases of high thermal insulation of the mineral, a temperature
gradient (hot vent/cool ocean) is nearly as effective as the allhot scenario.
Life thrives on harnessing efficiencies. While higher overall
product formation can be seen at higher currents (10
microamperes), excellent faradaic efficiencies can be achieved
with an approximation of the passive/expected current (10
nanoamperes). Herein, we demonstrated that a very small
current can be extremely efficient for CO2 reduction.
CONCLUSIONS:

Figure 2. Sketch of the free-energy transfer mechanism from natural
gradients on the early vent-ocean interface to drive the energy
protometabolism, a candidate seed to the chemiosmosis’ emergence on
early Earth. It is represented the different gradients in the vent-ocean
interface: the pH (𝛥𝑝𝐻), redox (𝛥𝜑) and the resulting potential gradient
(𝛥𝐸). The Ni-FeS-rich barrier mediates the electron-transfer mechanism
coupling the H2 oxidation and the CO2 reduction in a WL-like
protometabolism where two steps are occurring in the vent-ocean interface.

This investigation into mineral facilitated electroreduction
of CO2 suggests conditions where reactions from a
protometabolic Wood-Lyunghal pathway may be viable.
Formic acid and acetic acid can be generated in µM quantities
by the passive flow of electrons following geologically
plausible pH and redox gradients established at hydrothermal
vents. Additional downstream anabolic reactions (such as the
conversion of fumarate to succinate) can also be carried out in
the simulated hydrothermal vent. Higher temperatures lead to
better conversion of CO2 to formic acid, although the reaction
can still proceed under a temperature gradient analogous to
extant biological systems and similar to that expected for
Hadean ocean vents. Extremely small currents (nanoamps) are
enough with pH and redox gradients to efficiently enable CO2
reduction. These results support the SAVT model while
narrowing the search for optimal conditions for important
protometabolic steps for a potential emergence of life. Our
results also suggest that a variety of mineral mediators in the
presence of a gradient-rich vent environment can induce two
electrochemically-mediated metabolic steps for energy
conversion and carbon fixation in the absence of enzymes at the
interface of alkaline hydrothermal systems.
