ABSTRACT

20

Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (HABs) are an emerging threat to ecosystems, drinking

21

water safety, and the recreational industry. As an environmental challenge intertwined with

22

climate change and excessive nutrient discharge, HAB events occur more frequently and

23

irregularly. This dilemma calls for fast-response treatment strategies. This study developed an

24

electrochemical ozonation (ECO) process, which uses a Ni-Sb-SnO2 anode to produce locally

25

concentrated ozone (O3) on electrodes to inactivate cyanobacteria and destroy microcystins

26

within minutes. More importantly, the proof-of-concept was evolved into a full-scale boat-mounted

27

completely mixed flow reactor for the treatment of HAB-impacted lake water at a treatment

28

capacity of 544 m3/d and energy consumption of < 1 Wh/L. Both lab-scale and full-scale

29

investigations show that the byproducts (e.g., chlorate, bromate, trihalomethanes, and haloacetic

30

acids) in the ECO-treated lake water were below the regulatory limits for drinking water. The whole

31

effluent toxicity tests suggest that ECO treatment at 10 mA/cm2 posed certain chronic toxicity to

32

the model invertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia). However, the treatment at 7 mA/cm2 (identified as

33

the optimum condition) did not increase toxicity to model invertebrate and fish (Pimephales

34

promelas) species. This study is a successful example of leveraging fundamental innovations in

35

electrocatalysis to solve real-world problems.

INTRODUCTION

43

Widespread cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become an emerging threat to

44

ecosystems, recreational use of lakes, and drinking water supplies. Due to increased nutrient

45

discharge and global climate change, the occurrence of HABs is expected to be more frequent.1,2

46

In the United States, the cyanobacterial HAB occurrence was 7 days per year per waterbody in

47

2017, and the frequency was projected to be 18-39 days per year per water body by 2090.1 A

48

recent study based on a 45-year record (1970 – 2015) revealed that the frequency of HABs

49

occurring along the Chinese coast has increased by about 40% per decade.3 The surge

50

production of hepatotoxic, cytotoxic, and neurotoxic microcystins can be expected in the HAB

51

events.4

52

Chemical oxidation (using chlorine, permanganate, H2O2, etc.)5–7 and advanced oxidation

53

processes (UV/H2O2 and UV/chlorine)8 are promising for HAB mitigation at drinking water

54

treatment works. However, they are less practical for on-site lake remediation due to the uncertain

55

efficacy limited by hydrological conditions and concerns about the environmental impact of

56

chemicals.

57

There is a critical need for in situ treatment technology that can proactively curb HABs at the

58

early stage and precisely eliminate algae plumes in the impacted high-value areas (lake shores,

59

public beaches, etc.). Since the bloom is usually concentrated at the top 0–1 m of the water

60

column,9,10 we envision that mobile devices with pump-and-treat functionality could realize the

61

precise treatment of plume (instead of the whole water body) for maximum cost-effectiveness.

62

Electrochemical oxidation (EO)-based technologies, with the advantages of small footprint, high

63

efficiency, and chemical-free operation, could be the best fit. Previously, The EO treatment of

64

algae and microcystins equipped with anodes made of boron-doped diamond,11 metal oxide

65

(RuO2 and IrO2),12,13 and graphite14 was investigated at the lab scale. We advanced the EO

66

process by developing Ti4O7 filter anodes with pore sizes of 24−53 μm for the treatment of HAB-

67

impacted lake water at both lab and full scales.15 Similar to other reported anode materials, the

68

Ti4O7 filter anodes oxidize chloride in lake water to chlorine to inactivate algae cells and oxidize

69

cyanotoxins. The flow-through operation (by pumping water out of the filter anodes immersed in

70

the plume) significantly promoted convective mass transfer and thereby achieved higher

71

treatment performance than homogenous chlorination. Though the scaled-up demonstration at a

72

capacity of 110 m3/d was successful, two limitations were identified: (1) the chlorine yield, which

73

is associated with treatment performance, depends on chloride concentrations in lake water. (2)

74

The micropores of filter anode create large pressure drops ahead of the pump. Thus the treatment

75

capacity is limited by the pump suction head, which is significantly smaller than the lift head. The

76

pumps were also vulnerable to damage by cavitation.

77

This study aims to address these engineering challenges. First, the anode configuration was

78

transformed from microporous cartridge filters to an array of mesh electrodes with rhombus

79

0.5×0.8 mm openings. Correspondingly, as will be discussed below, the treatment operation was

80

changed to pumping water through the mesh electrode array in a boat-mount reactor. Second,

81

the electrocatalysts were shifted from Ti4O7 to nickel-doped antimony tin oxide (NATO: Ni-Sb-

82

SnO2). The incentive is that NATO has unique reactivity toward ozone (O3) evolution by water

83

oxidation

84

organic degradation and disinfection.18,19 However, its application in HAB mitigation was not

85

explored. Because water is the only required precursor for ozone production, the shift of reactive

86

species from free chlorine to O3 enables the treatment performance to be independent of chloride

87

concentration. In addition to process innovation, this study provides comprehensive evaluations

88

of the environmental implications, covering process impacts on byproduct formation and effluent

89

toxicity on an invertebrate and fish.

METHODS

92

Cyanobacteria Cultivation and Materials. Two cyanobacteria strains, Synechococcus sp. and

93

Microcystis aeruginosa (UTEX Culture Collection of Algae), were incubated in a shaker incubator

94

(Innova S44i, Eppendorf) with 10-30% photosynthetic light following our previous study.15 The

95

bench-scale tests involved mesh-type (0.5 × 0.8 mm rhombus openings) anode with either NATO

96

or antimony tin oxide (ATO: Sb-SnO2) coatings. The NATO and ATO anodes were prepared by

97

dip-coating titanium mesh into sol-gel solutions of metal-citrate complexes, followed by

98

calcination.18 The NATO anode comprises NATO out-layer coating (1 mg/cm2 projected area) and

99

ATO base coating (1 mg/cm2 projected area) on Ti mesh, while the ATO anode only contains the

100

ATO base coating. The dual-layer design of the NATO anode bestows the electrode with superior

101

durability and O3 yield. Details were provided in our previous publication.18 The full-scale electrode

102

array contains 20 pieces of mesh NATO anode (50  50 cm; 0.5 × 0.8 mm rhombus openings)

103

sandwiched by 21 pieces of perforated stainless steel sheet cathode (50  50 cm; round opening

104

at Ø 3 mm) at an interspace of 0.5 cm. The full-scale mesh NATO anodes were manufactured by

105

Square One Coating Systems following the same sol-gel coating + calcination procedure

106

described above.

107

Testing Conditions. In bench-sale investigations, a mesh anode (NATO or ATO; 5 × 5 cm) was

108

coupled with a stainless steel cathode (5 × 5 cm) at a distance of 0.5 cm and operated at current

109

densities of 7 or 10 mA/cm2. All tests were conducted in 95 mL phosphate buffer solution (PBS;

110

pH = 7.7, conductivity = 329 µS/cm) or lake water collected from Lake Neatahwanta, NY. The

111

synthetic water or lake water was spiked with cyanobacteria culture to reach an initial

112

concentration of 100 µg/L as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a).

113

Analytical Approaches. Chl-a was measured by a fluorometer, and Microcystin LR (MC-LR) was

114

quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS;

115

Thermo Scientific, Vanquish-TSQ ALTIS). Details were described previously.15 In the tests

116

involving Microcystis aeruginosa (an MC-LR toxin-producing strain), MC-LR detected in the bulk

117

solution was reported as extracellular MC-LR. Intracellular MC-LR was extracted by acetone after

118

retaining cells by filtering the water sample through a polycarbonate membrane with a pore size

119

of 0.2 µm.

120

Free chlorine was measured by a portable Hach DR900 colorimeter (HACH, CO) using a

121

DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) reagent. Dissolved O3 concentrations were determined

122

by the indigo method on a NanoDrop OneC spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).20

123

When measuring electrochemical O3 evolution in the presence of chloride, the anodically

124

generated free chlorine was masked by 1 M malonic acid.18 Trihalomethanes (THMs) and

125

haloacetic acids (HAAs) were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)

126

following EPA Method 624.1. Inorganic anions were analyzed by ion chromatography (Thermo

127

Dionex Integrion HPIC).21 The whole effluent toxicity tests on Pimephales promelas and

128

Ceriodaphnia dubia were independently conducted by AquaTOX Research, Inc., following EPA

129

Methods 2000.0 and 2002.0 respectively (EPA-821-R-02-013).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

132

Electrode Characterization.

133

Figure 1a shows the cyclic voltammetric (CV) profiles of NATO and ATO. We adopted the

134

Ni dopant level of 1 at.% (Ni/(Ni+Sb+Sn)) as optimized in previous studies. 16,22 The Ni doping

135

shifts the CV hysteresis toward lower potentials. The rise of the current response at lower

136

potentials can be attributed to the enhanced evolution of oxygen and O3.17 In the lake water

137

treatment, the mesh electrodes were operated at current densities between 6-10 mA/cm2

138

projected area, which leads to anodic potentials around 2.6-2.7 VRHE (Figure 1a), surpassing the

139

thermodynamic criteria for •OH radical evolution (•OH/H2O: 2.7 VNHE).23

144

Electrolysis using ATO could not generate O3. In contrast, the NATO generated dissolved

O3 in PBS electrolyte in the presence or absence of Cl- (Figure 1b). The evolution rate and current

146

efficiency in PBS electrolyte at 10 mA/cm2 are 0.0078 mmol/m2/s and 4.5%, respectively. Chlorine

147

evolution capability was tested in PBS electrolyte amended with 1 mM Cl -, a typical Cl-

148

concentration found in lake waters treated in this study (Table S1). NATO and ATO demonstrated

149

comparable chlorine evolution rates of 0.022 and 0.024 mmol/m2/s, respectively, at 10 mA/cm2

(Figure S1).

153

corresponding to an ECSA of 443.6 cm2 (Figure S2). The estimated ECSA is 8.9 times larger than

154

the projected surface area (50 cm2).

155

Bench-scale Investigation

156

The treatment performance of mesh-type ATO and NATO was evaluated based on the

157

inactivation efficiency of Synechococcus and Microcystis, two strains of common cyanobacteria

158

in algal blooms.25,26 Because Chl-a cannot maintain its structural integrity and light-adsorbing

159

properties after cell damage, it was used as an indicator to quantify the viable cell concentration

160

as a generally accepted approach.27–30 Synechococcus does not produce toxins. It was used in

161

most bench-scale tests to study the kinetics of Chl-a degradation (i.e., cyanobacteria inactivation)

162

without the interference of MC-LR. The optimized reaction conditions were then applied to treat

163

electrolyte spiked with Microcystis aeruginosa culture with co-existing MC-LR.

164

The tests of inactivation of Synechococcus were first performed in PBS electrolyte at a

165

current density of 10 mA/cm2. Note that both ATO and NATO have sufficiently high anodic

166

potentials of ~2.7 VRHE to produce •OH (Figure 1a). If •OH is responsible for algae inactivation,

167

ATO and NATO should exhibit similar performance. In contrast, it was found that ATO showed

168

negligible reactivity in Chl-a removal, and NATO significantly outperformed ATO (Figure 2a).

169

These results exclude the contribution of •OH-mediated oxidation and direct oxidation to cell

170

inactivation, leaving electrochemically generated O3 the only possible oxidant. The O3 evolution

171

on NATO involves the combination of surface-bound •OH with O2 to form •HO3, then O3.17,31

172

Therefore, the addition of 100 mM tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) to scavenge •OH halted the O3

173

production (below detection limit), and thereby retarded Chl-a removal (Figure 2b).

174

In the presence of chloride, NATO could produce free chlorine and O3. However, the

175

addition of up to 3 mM Cl- (a high record in lakes of the United States32) did not accelerate Chl-a

176

removal (Figure 2b). Previously, we determined the pseudo-first-order rate constant of Chl-a in

177

Synechococcus and free chlorine as 0.027 L/(mg min).33 With the presence of 1 mM Cl-, the time-

178

average free chlorine concentrations produced by NATO at 10 mA/cm2 within 120 s electrolysis

179

should be ~7 mg/L (Figure S1). If free chlorine is responsible for Chl-a removal, the half-life of the

180

reaction should be 220 s instead of the 48 s shown in Figure 2b.

181

The above investigations have excluded direct oxidation, •OH-mediated oxidation, and

182

free chlorine-mediated oxidation as the dominant cyanobacteria inactivation (i.e., Chl-a removal)

183

mechanisms, leaving electrochemical ozonation (ECO) the only pathway. The efficacy of ECO

184

was compared with homogeneous ozonation (Figure 2c). The homogeneous ozonation at 1.5

185

mg/L O3 achieved Chl-a removal kinetics similar to ECO. In contrast, ECO generated 0.48 mg/L

6
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h3kvt ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3767-8029 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

186

O3 at 120 s, corresponding to a time-average [O3] of 0.24 mg/L. ECO produced less bulk [O3]

187

(0.24 vs. 1.5 mg/L) to realize faster Chl-a removal kinetics than homogeneous ozonation. In other

188

words, the cyanobacteria inactivation could be attributed to the locally concentrated O3 produced

189

at the anode surface, and the surficial O3 concentration is equivalent to ~1.5 mg/L.

196

triplicate ± standard deviation.

197

After elucidating the reaction mechanism, the treatment tests were operated in more field-

198

like scenarios. In most of the field tests, the ECO full-scale system was operated at 7 mA/cm2

199

(see discussion below). At 7 mA/cm2, ECO was effective in the removal of Chl-a in electrolytes

200

with and without Cl- (Figure S3). As shown in Figure 3a, the ECO process is equally efficient for

201

the inactivation of Microcystis aeruginosa in PBS amended with 1 mM Cl-. The treatment was

202

further operated in Lake Neatahwanta water (collected before the HAB season and filtered to

203

exclude background cyanobacteria and MC-LR) spiked with Microcystis aeruginosa. The Chl-a

204

removal kinetics were slightly retarded by the water matrices, but the >90% removal efficiency

205

can still be achieved after 180 s electrolysis. In contrast to Synechococcus, the Microcystis

206

aeruginosa culture contains both intra- and extracellular MC-LR. The destruction of MC-LR

207

consists of two parallel steps: (1) the lysed cells release intracellular MC-LR, which then become

208

extracellular MC-LR in water, and (2) the destruction of existing and nascent extracellular MC-LR.

209

The degradation of co-existing MC-LR in extra- and intra-cellular forms was investigated in PBS

210

electrolyte amended with 1 mM Cl- and lake water. In both media, extra-cellular MC-LR was

subjected to faster degradation than intra-cellular MC-LR, as the degradation of the former

required the destruction of cell structures (Figure 3b).

219

respectively. Data are presented as the mean value of triplicate ± standard deviation.

220
221

The bench-scale treatability study concluded that the ECO process is efficient for the

222

removal of cyanobacteria and MC-LR at short, minute-level retention time. The remaining

223

roadblock toward field development is understanding the environmental implications of the ECO

224

technology. Given the fast Chl-a degradation kinetics, we hypothesize that significant

225

cyanobacteria inactivation could be achieved before the yield of byproducts. Concern about the

226

formation of inorganic byproducts was first addressed in the bench-scale study under field-like

227

conditions. Other environmental aspects (organic byproducts and eco-toxicity) were investigated

228

in the field application (see the following content). Chlorate (ClO3-) was identified as the product

229

stemming from the electrochemical oxidation of Cl-. Figure S4 shows the evolution of ClO3- in PBS

230

electrolyte amended with 1 mM Cl- and lake water containing ~1 mM Cl- at 10 mA/cm2. The results

231

indicate that the evolution of ClO3- was suppressed in the lake water compared with electrolysis

232

in PBS electrolytes, possibly due to the depletion of free chlorine by reacting with matrice

233

components. As will be discussed below, the full-scale ECO reactor was operated at a Chl-a

234

removal efficiency of ~40%, corresponding to a treatment duration of 60 s in batch mode. In this

235

scenario, the [ClO3-] was below the detection limit (5 μg/L) and the World Health Organization

236

(WHO) guideline of 0.7 mg/L.34

237

Bromate is a byproduct derived from the ozonation of bromide (Br-).35 We do not believe

238

this is a concern in the lake water treatment in this study because Br- was not detected in the lake

239

water of two test sites (Table S1). To address the concern about the future applications in treating

240

Br- containing water, we investigated the formation BrO3- in the ECO treatment of PBS electrolyte

241

containing 0.2 mg/L Br-, a concentration reported in some surface water.36 The results show that,

242

throughout the 180 s ECO treatment process at 7 mA/cm2, the dominant product is HOBr and

243

BrO3- formation was not detected (Figure S5). This finding highlights the advantage of ECO over

244

homogeneous ozonation as the former yields less bulk O3 to form BrO3-.

245

The bench-scale investigation concludes that (1) ECO effectively removes cyanobacteria

246

and cyanotoxins at short, minute-level retention times; (2) the reaction is built upon the locally

247

concentrated O3 produced at the NATO anode. The efficacy is independent of chloride

248

concentration, which broadens the treatment scenarios in fresh waters.

249

Field Applications

250

A boat-mount ECO system was developed for the scaled-up treatment of HAB-impacted

251

lake water (Figure 4a). The full-scale electrode array contains 20 pieces of mesh NATO anode

(50  50 cm; 0.5 × 0.8 mm rhombus openings) sandwiched by 21 pieces of perforated stainless

253

steel sheet cathode (50  50 cm; round opening at Ø 3 mm) at an interspace of 0.5 cm (Figure

254

4b). The polycarbonate reactor has a 190 L effective volume (excluding electrode array volume).

Other on-board components include a custom-made DC power supply, generators, and a water

256

pump. Algae plumes were captured by an intake pipe at an adjustable depth (0-1 m) underwater.

257

An intake screen with a mesh opening size of 1 mm was installed on the intake port to prevent

258

the entry of fish and other large aquatic life (Figure S6). Lake water was transferred from the pipe

259

to the pump and pushed through the 190 L reactor at a flow rate of 378 L/min (i.e., treatment

260

capacity of 544 m3/d), corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 30 s.

261

The electrode array has a total projected anode area of 10 m2. Applying 600-1000 A total

262

current on the electrode array resulted in current densities of 6-10 mA/cm2 with a cell voltage

263

ranging from 12-20 V. The electrode array was tightly packed in the reactor. In operation, water

264

passing through the electrode mesh incurred efficient mass transfer. We have conducted

265

preliminary tests in the field to show that the Chl-a concentrations in samples collected from the

266

mid-height sampling port (representing bulk concentration) and outlet were the same (Figure S7).

267

Therefore, the reactor can be considered a completely mixed-flow reactor (CMFR).

268

Based on the bench-scale batch reactions (data set of “PBS w/ 1 mM Cl-” in Figures 2b

269

and S3), the pseudo-first-order rate constants (kECO’s) at 7 and 10 mA/cm2 are 0.026 and 0.061 s-

270

1, respectively. When transforming the reaction from batch to CMFR, the Chl-a removal efficiency

271

can be estimated by

272

Removal efficiency (%) = (1-C/C0) × 100% = 1-1/(1+𝜏kECO)

(1)

273

where C0 and C are Chl-a concentrations in water entering and exiting the reactor, respectively.

274

𝜏 is the hydraulic retention time (30 s). Consequently, the removal efficiencies were projected as

275

44% and 64% for 7 and 10 mA/cm2 operation, respectively, in CMFR mode.

276

The performance of the full-scale system was validated in the treatment of algal blooms

277

that occurred in Lake Neatahwanta (43°18'30"N 76°26'14"W) and Oneida Lake (43°10'25"N

278

75°55'50"W) in New York state. Lake Neatahwanta was treated in the midst of an algal bloom

279

with 105 μg/L Chl-a and 3 μg/L MC-LR, while tests on Oneida Lake happened in the early

280

blooming stage with Chl-a concentration of 5.4 ug/L (Table S1). Each field deployment lasted for

281

one day, with 9 to 12 pairs of influent and effluent samples taken. Tests in Oneida Lake were

282

performed at current densities of 6-7 mA/cm2, while those in Lake Neatahwanta were conducted

283

at 7-10 mA/cm2. As shown in Figure 4c, treatment operated at 7 and 10 mA/cm2 achieved Chl-a

284

removal efficiency of 39% and 62%, respectively, approaching the predicted values based on the

285

CMFR model. More importantly, plotting removal efficiency data against specific energy

286

consumption (Wh/L) shows that the field test performances align well with the bench-scale data

287

set. The convergence of laboratory results and full-scale performance on Chl-a removal

288

demonstrates the promising linear scalability of the ECO process in cyanobacteria inactivation

289

using specific energy consumption as the key design parameter, given that the same anodes (i.e.,

290

NATO) are used.

291

Intracellular MC-LR was not found in the Lake Neatahwanta water samples. The treatment

292

at 7 mA/cm2 led to an effluent extracellular MC-LR concentration (i.e., MC-LR resides in lake

293

water) of 0.41 μg/L (vs. C0 = 3 μg/L), corresponding to a destruction efficiency of 86%. Note that

294

it is challenging to study the extracellular MC-LR degradation kinetics due to the rapid degradation

295

in ECO within a minute. Nonetheless, the 86% destruction of MC-LR when 40% Chl-a degradation

296

was obtained in the full-scale CMFR reactor is comparable with the results observed in the lab-

297

scale batch reactor (>95% destruction of MC-LR when ~40% Chl-a degradation was achieved,

298

as shown in Figure 3).

The current density of 7 mA/cm2 (total current of 700 A and cell voltage of 14 V in treating

309

Lake Neatahwanta) was identified as the optimum condition, balancing the significant algae

310

removal, low byproduct formation, and insignificant toxicity (discussed below). It is important to

311

note that the ~40% Chl-a removal at a short retention time of 30 s already incurred instant

improvement in water clarity (Figure S8). Improvement in local water quality can be expected by

the circulative treatment of water. The energy consumption of 0.5 Wh/L is also lower than the

314

chlorine-based electrochemical HAB mitigation system (1.1 Wh/L) reported in our previous

Environmental Implications.

318

The formation of halogenated byproducts, including trihalomethanes (THMs) and five

319

haloacetate acids (HAA5), was investigated in the treatment of Lake Neatahwanta and Oneida

320

Lake. THMs and HAA5 were not detected in the influent samples. In the effluent samples,

321

chloroform and dichloroacetic acid were the dominant THMs and HAAs, respectively. For

322

treatment operated at current densities of 6 and 7 mA/cm2, the total concentrations of THMs and

323

HAA5 were below the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) values regulated by the U.S. EPA

324

(Figure 4d).

325

Whole effluent toxicity tests were conducted to evaluate whether the effluent from the ECO

326

process would negatively impact the aquatic life in the receiving water. Samples of influent (INF)

327

and treated effluent (EFF) were collected during the operation in Lake Neatahwanta (Table S2)

328

and Oneida Lake (Table S3) at 6-10 mA/cm2. In the toxicity tests, model freshwater invertebrate

329

(Ceriodaphnia dubia) and fish (Pimephales promelas) species were exposed to INF samples, EFF

330

samples, and lab control water (CON). Ten replicates were used for Ceriodaphnia dubia, and four

331

replicates for Pimephales promelas for each INF, EFF, and CON exposure. Comparing the

332

toxicity test results of samples obtained at 10 mA/cm2 (Table S2), although Ceriodaphnia dubia

333

survival was 100% at both 48 h (Acute) and 6-7 days (Chronic), reproduction is lower in EFF than

334

INF, suggesting the treatment induced toxicity for the invertebrate species. Conversely, no effects

335

were observed on the survival and growth of Pimephales promelas. The analysis of samples

336

derived from operation at 6 and 7 mA/cm2 show that there were no significant survival impacts at

337

either 48 h (acute) or 6-7 days (chronic) for either the invertebrate or fish species, with survival

338

rates of 100%. Similarly, there were no significant effects on the reproduction of invertebrates or

339

growth of fish in EFF compared to INF. The whole effluent toxicity tests confirmed that the ECO

340

process operated at 6 and 7 mA/cm2 did not induce acute or chronic toxicity in the treated effluent,

341

echoing our conclusion that 7 mA/cm2 is the optimum current density.

CONCLUSIONS

344

This study developed an ECO process for the rapid inactivation of cyanobacteria and the

345

destruction of MC-LR. The process used NATO anodes to generate locally concentrated O3 as

12
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h3kvt ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3767-8029 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

346

the major reactive species. Compared with homogeneous ozonation, the ECO process achieved

347

the same degree of treatment but yielded lower bulk [O3]. Note that a majority of electrochemical

348

water treatment processes rely on the electrolysis of chloride to produce free chlorine as oxidants,

349

and the treatment performance depends on the chloride concentration37,38. The shift of the

350

dominant oxidant from chlorine to O3 provides a new strategy for sustaining high treatment

351

efficiency in freshwater with a limited chloride source and suppressing the formation of byproducts.

352

The significant merit of the engineering of this study is the scaled-up application of the

353

ECO process to solve real-world problems. The performance of batch mode lab-scale reactor was

354

replicated in a boat-mounted CMFR reactor using specific energy consumption as a benchmark.

355

In addition to the successful demonstration of HAB mitigation, we also evaluated whole effluent

356

toxicity to show that the ECO process operated at the optimized current density of 7 mA/cm2 did

357

not increase the effluent toxicity. This case study sets an example for the scaled-up application

358

of electrified water treatment technology in environmental remediation.
