Abstract. Multiple field studies have led to suggestions that nitrate radical (NO3) participates in oxidizing gaseous Hg(0) in the
atmosphere. These suppositions are hard to reconcile with the two-step mechanism of Hg(0) conversion to Hg(II) via Hg(I), due
10

to the instability of the NO3-Hg(I). We use a high level of computational chemistry to determine its bond energy as 6.5 kcal
mol-1. We use statistical mechanics to compute the equilibrium constant, Kc(T) for NO3 + Hg(0) = NO3Hg(I), and a box model
to investigate a field study and laboratory kinetic investigation of this chemistry. Under the conditions of the one field study
showing a correlation between [NO3] and [Hg(II) (g)] , NO3 could not have contributed significantly to the formation of Hg(II).
In addition, we find that the one experimental kinetic study of this reaction does not constrain the rate constant.

1 Introduction
The atmosphere transports gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0), GEM) globally, so that this neurotoxic pollutant is found in the
poles as well as near its emission sources (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998). GEM deposits from the gaseous atmosphere roughly
equally into vegetation versus oceans, in competition with reacting to form gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), that is, Hg(II)
20

(Shah et al., 2021; Zhou and Obrist, 2021). GOM, if not reduced back to GEM (Saiz-Lopez et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2022), will
deposit predominantly into oceans. The contrasting fates of GEM and GOM means that we need to understand the redox
chemistry of atmospheric mercury to predict when and where mercury enters ecosystems.
Gas-phase oxidation of GEM to GOM in the tropopshere and lower stratosphere occurs via addition of a radical (Br, OH, or
Cl) to form a mercury-centered radical form of Hg(I), which is further oxidized to Hg(II) by reaction with ozone (Castro et al.,

25

2022; Gómez Martín et al., 2022), NO2, HOO, or most other radicals (Dibble et al., 2012, 2013, 2020; Goodsite, M. E. Plane
and Skov, 2004; Horowitz et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2024, 2020). Production of Br, OH, and
Cl falls dramatically around sunset, so this mechanism does not explain multiple observations of elevated [GOM] at night.
During nighttime, nitrate radical (NO3) is the major oxidant for most volatile organic compounds (Brown and Stutz, 2012), so,
naturally, atmospheric scientists have invoked NO3 to explain elevated [GOM] at night (Mao et al., 2008; Peleg et al., 2015;

30

Weiss-Penzias et al., 2003). Peleg et al. (2015) presented the most compelling evidence, namely, a strong correlation between

measured nightime [GOM] and [NO3] in Jerusalem over the course of six weeks. Unfortunately, there is very little kinetic or
thermodynamic data to support these suggestions. Sommar et al. (1997) reported an upper limit to the reaction:

(1) had subsequently been revealed to be highly endothermic (by ~45 kcal mol-1). As a result, it seems more likely that reaction
(1) proceeds via formation of an adduct:

NO3Hg(I)• + M

(2)

(where M is a third body) mimicking the mechanism for other radicals:
40

Hg(0) + Y + M 

YHg(I)• + M (Y = Br, OH, Cl)

(3)

However, quantum calculations by Dibble et al. (2012) indicated that NO3Hg • was very weakly bound (5.0 kcal mol-1 at 0
(I)

K). At the time, the only known pathway for oxidation of NO3Hg(I)• was, as for other YHg(I)•, via addition of radicals, •Z (Z =
NO2, HOO, halogen oxides, etc., but not NO):
NO3Hg(I)• + •Z + M → NO3Hg(II)Z + M
45

(4)

The weak bonding of NO3Hg • and the low concentrations of radicals, •Z, in the atmosphere led Dibble et al. (2012) to
(I)

conclude that NO3 could not initiate oxidation of GEM to GOM.
The subsequent report, by Peleg et al. (2015) of a strong correlation between [NO3] and [GOM] led us to consider two caveats
to the conclusion of Dibble et al (2012). First, NO3 radical is rather challenging for quantum chemistry, and the previous
calculations could easily be improved upon. Second, it had subsequently been determined that YHg(I)• could react with ozone
50

with a high rate constant (Castro et al., 2022; Gómez Martín et al., 2022), via:
YHg(I)• + O3 → YHg(II)O• + O2

(5)

In the case of HOHg(I)•, with a bond energy at 0 K (D0) of 11.0 kcal mol-1 (Dibble et al., 2020), the abundance of ozone and
the high rate constant for reaction (5) enables OH to contribute significantly (~30%) to global production of GOM from GEM
(Shah et al., 2021). Without reaction (5), Dibble et al. (2020) concluded that OH would contribute < 1% to GEM oxidation.
55

Typical nighttime [NO3] is perhaps 20-100 times higher than typical daytime [OH] (Chua et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2015;
Penkett et al., 2007), and this higher concentration could enable NO3 to initiate oxidation of GEM even though the NO3-Hg(I)
bond energy was likely lower that the HO-Hg(I) bond energy.
Below we discuss the theoretical methods for our calculations. We then report the structure and bond energy of NO3Hg(I)•,
followed by the equilibrium constant of reaction (2) versus temperature. Next, we use these results to evaluate the reliability

60

of the upper limit to k2 reported by Sommar et al. (1997). We then determine whether NO3-initiated oxidation of GEM can
explain the observations of Peleg et al. (2015). Finally, we briefly consider the potential for NO3 to play a major role in GEM
oxidation the atmosphere, more generally.

2 Methods
Our calculations aim at an accurate D0 for NO3Hg(I)• to accurately calculate the equilibrium constant for reaction (2). The
65

electronic structure of NO3 poses major challenges on quantum chemistry calculations because of the multireference characters
and symmetry breaking due to pseudo-Jahn-Teller coupling in its open-shell electronic states (Eisfeld and Morokuma, 2000;
Stanton et al., 1991; Viel and Eisfeld, 2018). On the other hand, the NO3− anion has a simple closed-shell electronic ground
state. Equation-of-motion ionization potential coupled-cluster (EOMIP-CC) calculations (Stanton and Bartlett, 1993; Stanton
and Gauss, 1994) using the closed-shell ground state of NO3− as the reference state and removing an electron to obtain NO3

70

has been shown to accurately describe low-lying electronic states of NO3 (Stanton, 2007, 2009). We follow this prescription
here and perform calculations of NO3 and HgNO3(I)• using the EOMIP-CC singles and double (CCSD) and CC singles doubles
triples (CCSDT) methods (Matthews and Stanton, 2015; Stanton and Gauss, 1999). The spin-free exact two-component theory
in its one-electron variant (the SFX2C-1e scheme) (Cheng and Gauss, 2011; Dyall, 2001; Liu and Peng, 2009) has been used
to treat the scalar-relativistic effect. The equilibrium structures and harmonic vibrational frequencies of NO3 and NO3Hg(I)•

75

have been calculated with the valence electrons correlated using triple-zeta quality atomic natural orbital (ANORCC1) basis
sets using the primitive functions of the ANO-RCC sets (Faegri Jr, 2001; Roos et al., 2003, 2005) recontracted for the SFX2C1e calculations using CCSD density matrices. We have performed calculations of harmonic vibrational frequencies to confirm
that the optimized structure corresponds to a stable structure on the potential energy surface.
To an obtain an accurate value of D0, we carried out EOMIP-CCSD calculations with more complete treatments of basis-set

80

and electron-correlation effects. These calculations have correlated valence and semicore electrons including the Hg 4f5s5p5d,
N 2s2p, and O 2s2p electrons. We used uncontracted triple-zeta (TZ) and quadruple-zeta (QZ) basis sets for Hg constructed
using primitive functions of the ANO-RCC sets and correlation-consistent sets (Peterson and Puzzarini, 2005) as well as augcc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ sets for N and O (Kendall et al., 1992) recontracted for the SFX2C-1e scheme. The basis-set-limit
(∞Z) EOMIP-CCSD energies were obtained by combining the QZ Hartree-Fock energies with basis-set-limit values for the

85

EOMIP-CCSD electron-correlation and ionization energies estimated by extrapolating the TZ and QZ results using a simple
two-point formula (Helgaker et al., 1997). The contributions due to the correlation of deep inner-shell electrons were estimated
by performing EOMIP-CCSD/TZ calculations with the correlation of Hg 4s, 4p, 4d and O 1s orbitals. Furthermore, the
contributions from triple excitations were obtained as the differences between EOMIP-CCSDT and CCSD results using the
ANORCC1 basis sets. We also carried out EOMIP-CCSD calculations with spin-orbit coupling to obtain the second-order

90

spin-orbit (SO) contributions to D0. Here the X2C Hamiltonian (Dyall, 2001; Kutzelnigg and Liu, 2005; Liu and Peng, 2009)
with atomic mean field (Heß et al., 1996) integrals (the X2CAMF scheme) (Liu and Cheng, 2018; Zhang and Cheng, 2022)
has been used to provide variational treatments of spin-orbit coupling. We have used the recent implementation of the
X2CAMF EOM excitation energy (EOMEE)-CCSD method (Asthana et al., 2019) together with the continuum orbital trick
(Stanton and Gauss, 1999) for these X2CAMF-EOMIP calculations. The SO contribution to D0 obtained from these

95

calculations is less than 0.1 kcal/mol and thus insignificant for the present discussion. The basis sets used in the calculations

described here are documented in the Supporting Information. All calculations were performed using the CFOUR program
package (Stanton et al..; Matthews et al., 2020). We calculated the equilibrium constant for reaction (2) vs. temperature (200320 K) from D0 with the thermo program in the MultiWell program suite (Barker, 2001, 2009; Barker et al., 2023), using the
rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation.
100

Our goal for understanding the oxidation of NO3Hg(I)• by radicals (NO2, HOO, BrO, NO3, and O2) and ozone is to verify that
these reactions occur similarly to those of HOHg(I)• and BrHg(I)•. While this requires reliable levels of theory, it does not
require the precision needed in determining D0. These quantum chemistry calculations used Gaussian16 (Frisch et al., 2016)
and ORCA 5.0.3 (Neese, 2012, 2022). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to optimize geometries and compute
harmonic vibrational frequencies. We used three functionals that have proven reliable in our previous studies of mercury

105

chemistry: CAM-B3LYP (Yanai et al., 2004) with D3BJ dispersion correction (Grimme et al., 2011), PBE0 (Adamo and
Barone, 1999), and M06-2X (Zhao and Truhlar, 2008). For H, N, and O atoms we used Dunning’s aug-cc-pVTZ basis set
(Dunning, 1989; Peterson and Dunning, 2002). To account for scalar relativistic effects in Hg and Br we used the
Stuttgart/Cologne small-core pseudopotentials (ECPMDF60 and ECPMDF10, respectively) while the electrons outside the
pseudopotential were described with the aug-cc-pVTZ-PP basis set of Peterson and co-workers (Figgen et al., 2005; Peterson

110

et al., 2003; Peterson and Puzzarini, 2005). Our shorthand for this combination of basis sets is AVTZ. All radicals were treated
with spin-unrestricted wavefunctions, and we verified the stability of wavefunctions. Spin orbit corrections to relative energies
should be modest (< 1 kcal mol-1) except for reactions involving BrO (Dixon et al., 2000; Jiao and Dibble, 2015).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Hg binding to NO3 radical
115

We initially optimized a C2v structure of NO3Hg(I)•, but this turned out to be a transition state (denoted TS-NO3Hg(I)•) at both
DFT/AVTZ (for all three functionals) and SFX2C-1e-EOMIP-CCSD(T)/ANORCC1 levels. Instead, NO3Hg(I)• adopts a
structure of Cs symmetry with the Hg atom binding asymmetrically (2.20 vs 2.56 Å) to two O atoms of NO3 (see Fig. 1).
Vibrational frequencies are listed in Tables S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information.

We computed the NO3‒Hg bond energy at 0 K (D0) as 6.5 kcal mol-1, which is 1.5 kcal mol-1 higher than the value computed
previously. There are multiple possible contributions to this difference, including that Dibble et al. (2012) used lower levels
of theory for structures (B3LYP vs EOMIP-CCSD) and energies (CCSD(T) vs CCSDT), and smaller basis sets for the energy
evaluation (triple-zeta versus quadruple zeta extrapolated to the basis set limit).
125

As shown in Table S2, the difference between the D0 values obtained from ∞Z and QZ calculations is about 1 kcal mol-1. The
remaining basis-set effects are likely substantially smaller. The contribution to D0 from the correlation of the inner-shell
electrons is around 0.5 kcal mol-1. The remaining errors due to the correlation of even deeper electrons are expected to be
insignificant. The triples contribution to D0 amounts to around 0.5 kcal mol-1. The remaining electron-correlation contributions
due to quadruple excitations is expected to be smaller than the triples contributions. Based on the trends in these results, we

130

estimate the uncertainty in the contribution from electronic energies to the value of D0 to be about 1 kcal mol-1.
Note that the NO3 molecule exhibit complex vibronic structures because of the strong vibronic coupling between the ground
(𝑋𝑋�) and second electronic excited (𝐵𝐵� ) states of NO3 (Eisfeld and Morokuma, 2000; Stanton, 2007, 2009; Viel and Eisfeld,

2018). The present calculations of the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) contribution to the bond energy used the harmonic

vibrational frequencies given in Table S3 and S4. Viel and Eisfeld (2018) computed the anharmonic vibrational frequencies
135

of NO3 while accounting for 𝑋𝑋� -𝐵𝐵� vibronic coupling. They computed the ZPE as 6.8 kcal mol-1, 0.2 kcal mol-1 smaller than our

value of 7.0 kcal mol-1. To compare directly with their value, we need to correct our NO3Hg(I)• results for anharmonicity. We

did this using vibrational second-order perturbation theory (Mills, 1972) and obtained an anharmonic contribution of -0.1 kcal
mol-1 to the ZPE of NO3Hg. This means that our ZPE is 6.9 kcal mol-1, or just 0.1 kcal mol-1 higher than obtained by Viel and
Eisfeld (2018).
140

Table 1 lists the values of Kc for reaction (2) in the range 200 K ≤ T ≤ 320 K. We fit the values in Table 1 to an Arrhenius
expression:
Kc = 1.0 × 10-24 e3305/T cm3 molecule-1

(6)

with less than 1% deviation from the values in Table 1. Because vibrational frequencies of NO3 are challenging to compute
accurately, we used the observed vibrational frequencies as tabulated in the MultiWell Thermodynamics Database (Barker et
145

al., 2017) rather than the computed values. Using the calculated vibrational frequencies lowered Kc modestly, by 9% to 16%
for 200 K ≤ T ≤ 320 K. Using the vibrational energy levels of Viel and Eisfeld (2018) raised Kc by 2.4% at 200 K and lowered
Kc by 4.2%, with a monotonic progression between those two temperatures. These uncertainties in Kc are much smaller than
those due to the uncertainty in D0, which creates a factor of 5 uncertainty at 298 K). As we show below, this uncertainty will
not change the conclusions of our analysis of the experiments of Sommar et al. (1997) or the field study of Peleg et al. (2015).

3.2 Bimolecular reactions of NO3Hg radical
155

We investigated the reactions of NO3Hg(I)• with ozone and with some of the more abundant radicals in the atmosphere: Z =
O2, NO2, HOO, NO3, and BrO. To help analyze the experimental work of Sommar et al. (1997) we also studied the reactions
of NO3Hg(I)• with NO3 and HNO3.
As can be seen from Fig.2, NO3Hg(II)-Z bond energies are only slightly lower than those for HOHg(II)-Z; we previously showed
the near-equivalence of HOHg(II)-Z and BrHg(II)-Z bond energies (see Dibble et al., 2020). For NO3Hg(II)-NO3, for which no

160

HOHg(II)NO3 or BrHg(II)NO3 analogues appear in the literature, the bond energy is 64.4 kcal mol-1. All bond energies are
tabulated in the Supporting Information (Table S7). We verified that these radical-radical addition reactions proceed without
a barrier, except in the cases of Z = O2 and NO3. Note that previous calculations established the presence of a barrier to BrHg(I)•
+ O2 + M → BrHg(II)OO + M (Wu et al., 2022).

165

Reaction of NO3Hg(I)• with ozone to produce NO3Hg(II)O + O2 is significantly exothermic (∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟° (0 𝐾𝐾) = -46.3 kcal mol-1) and
possesses no barrier. This suggests that the rate constant for this reaction may be as high as that for BrHg(I)• + O3 (7.5 × 10-11

cm3 molecule-1 sec-1 at room temperature) (Castro et al., 2022; Gómez Martín et al., 2022). This suggests that the major
bimolecular reaction of NO3Hg(I)• in the atmosphere, like HOHg(I)• and BrHg(I)•, is reaction with ozone (Shah et al., 2021).

170

mol-1) is not included in this Figure.
Reinterpreting the Experimental Study of k(Hg(0) + NO3)
Sommar et al. (1997) used a fast-flow discharge reactor to investigate the rate constant for Hg(0) + NO3 at total pressures of 5.4
– 9.4 hPa in He. Based on previous work using the same reactor at similar pressures, the flow velocity in the reactor probably
exceeded 100 cm sec-1 (Langer et al., 1993). Given the total reactor length of 1 meter, the reaction time would be less than one

175

second. Nitrate radical was produced from F + HNO3 before Hg entered the reactor, and was initially present (8-17 × 1012
molecule cm-3) in excess over Hg(0) (0.7-2.1 × 1012 molecule cm-3). Sommar et al. (1997) assumed that reaction of NO3 with
Hg(0) was irreversible on the time scale of the experiment. This assumption was not unreasonable given the erroneous data then
available on ∆𝐻𝐻𝑓𝑓0 for HgO (Grade and Hirschwald, 1982), from which it was assumed that the following reaction was
thermodynamically favorable:

180

Hg(0) + NO3 →

Hg(II)O + NO2

However, three quantum chemical studies using three different approaches show that Hg(II)O is very weakly bound (3-6 kcal
mol-1) (Filatov and Cremer, 2004; Peterson et al., 2007; Shepler and Peterson, 2003), which renders reaction (7) so endothermic
(∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟° ≈ +45 kcal mol-1) that it will not occur. We view NO3Hg(I)• as the only reasonable product of reaction of NO3 with Hg(0).
If NO3Hg(I)• falls apart to regenerate Hg(0) faster than, or in competition with, its reaction to form Hg(II), then the upper limit

185

reported by Sommar et al. would not be valid. Therefore, we next consider whether bimolecular reactions of NO3Hg(I)• could
compete with dissociation of NO3Hg(I)• to NO3 + Hg(0) under the experimental conditions of Sommar et al. (1997).
Oxidation of NO3Hg(I)• to Hg(II) could occur via reaction with HNO3:

190

NO3Hg(I)• + HNO3 →

NO3Hg(II)H + NO3

(8a)

NO3Hg(I)• + HNO3 →

Hg(II)(NO3)2 + H

(8b)

We find these reactions to be significantly endothermic (at CAM-B3LYP-D3BJ/AVTZ). ∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟0 (0 K) is +24 kcal mol-1 for (8a)

and +39 kcal mol-1 for (8b). We estimate an upper limit to the rate constant for the less endothermic reaction channel (8a). The
estimate is made via k8a(T) = 𝐴𝐴𝑒𝑒 −𝐸𝐸𝑎𝑎/𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 , taking ∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟0 (0 K) as a lower limit for Ea and 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 sec-1 as the upper

limit to A. This approximation gives k8a(298) < 10-26 cm3 molecule-1 sec-1. But even if we assume that the DFT value of
195

∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟0 (0 K) exceeds the true value by as much as 10 kcal mol-1, we get k8a(298) < 10-20 cm3 molecule-1 sec-1. The HNO3
concentration was not given, but must have been a modest fraction of the total pressure of 5.4-9.4 hPa (9.8 × 1017 molecule

cm-3). Using the upper limit to k8b, and [HNO3] = 1 hPa, the pseudo-first order rate constant (k8a’ = k8a[HNO3]) for HgNO3 loss

falls below 10-2 sec-1, corresponding to a lifetime greater than 100 sec. Clearly, HNO3 did not contribute to gas-phase loss of
HgNO3 in the available reaction time of 1 second.
As discussed above, NO3Hg(I)• can react with NO3 over a barrier to make Hg(II)(NO3)2:
200

NO3Hg(I)• + NO3 →

Hg(II)(NO3)2

(9)

We simulated the gas-phase formation and dissociation of NO3Hg(I)• (reactions 2 and -2) along with reaction (9) in Kintecus
(Ianni, 2003, 2019) over 1 second, equal to our estimate of the longest reaction time in the experiment. We set k9 at 10-10 cm3
molecule-1 s-1 to maximize the formation of Hg(II). We varied k2 between 10-10 and 10-16 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 and computed k-2
from Kc at 298 K (see Table 1). For k2 > 5 × 10-15 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, the concentration of NO3Hg(I)• was controlled by
205

equilbrium to within 1%, and the loss of GEM was less than 0.2% at 1 second. Figure 3 depicts the time evolution of [Hg(0)],
[NO3Hg(I)•], and [Hg(II)(NO3)2] under these conditions. The small fractional losses of GEM in our simulations would not have
been observable by Sommar et al. against the wall loss that dominated their experiment. Even if Kc was ten times higher than
computed here, the simulated gas-phase loss of GEM could not have exceeded 1.4%, amounting to less than 3% of the loss of
GEM to the walls at their lower S/V ratio for a one-second reaction time. Given that reported 20% uncertainty in the effective

210

second-order rate constant for wall loss under these conditions, this small extent of gas-phase loss would not have been
noticeable. Therefore, the work of Sommar et al. (1997) does not constrain the value of k2.

In separate experiments, Sumner et al. (2005) briefly reported on upper limits to k2 of 7-30 × 10-15 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 in chamber
experiments in 1 atm of air. They did not report any concentration data that would allow us to simulate the conditions of their
experiment. Given that k2 is expected to be pressure-dependent, its value at this pressure would probably greatly exceed its
215

NO3-Initiated Oxidation of GEM Cannot Explain Nighttime GOM Production in Peleg et al.

Peleg et al. (2015) reported strong correlations between nighttime [GOM] and [NO3] over their six-week study period, but an
absence of correlation with [GEM], [particulate mercury], [O3], [CO], [SO2], [sulfate], or wind direction. Citing the argument
of (Dibble et al. (2012) that the instability of NO3Hg(I)• would prevent it from initiating oxidation of GEM, Peleg et al. were
careful to suggest that NO3 was “involved” in GEM oxidation, rather than initiating GEM oxidation. However, we know of
225

only two roles for oxidants in Hg(II) production: either initiation by forming Hg(I) or oxidation of Hg(I) to Hg(II). Subsequent to
the publication of Peleg, et al., it was learned that ozone can oxidize Hg(I) to Hg(II) with a high rate constant (k5 = 7.5 ×10-11
cm3 molecule-1 s-1) (Castro et al., 2022; Gómez Martín et al., 2022). Given this high rate constant, the 69 ± 75 ng m-3 of NO3
present under the conditions of Peleg et al. would not measurably increase the rate of oxidation of Hg(I) over that caused by 90
± 28 µg m-3 of ozone. However, the discovery of the reaction of Hg(I) with ozone could revise our estimates of the potential

230

role of weakly-bound Hg(I) species in GEM oxidation. Consider, for example, initiation by OH radical: OH had been thought
to contribute < 1% to global GEM oxidation (Dibble et al., 2020), but adding to models the reaction HOHg(I)• + O3 →
HOHg(II)O • + O3 increases the global influence of OH to ~30% (Shah et al., 2021). More recently, Lee et al. (2024) suggested
that atomic iodine can initiate oxidation despite the low bond energy of IHg(I)(Cremer et al., 2008; Salter et al., 1986; Shepler

et al., 2005). Accordingly, to investigate the role of NO3 in oxidation of GEM to GOM, we simulated the potential for nitrate
235

radical to initiate production of GOM with the following mechanism:
Hg + NO3 + M
NO3Hg(I)• +

NO3Hg(I)• + M

(R2, R-2)

O3 → NO3Hg(II)O• + O2

(R10)



Our mechanism omits the subsequent reactions of NO3Hg(II)O•. By analogy to HOHg(II)O• and BrHg(II)O•, we presume that
reactions of NO3Hg(II)O• with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx would lead to formation of closed-shell GOM
240

compounds (Hewa Edirappulige et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2019a, b). But reaction of NO3Hg(II)O• with CO would yield NO3Hg(I)•
(Hewa Edirappulige et al., 2023; Khiri et al., 2019) thereby reducing [GOM] below the total [NO3Hg(II)O•] produced. We
cannot address these competing processes due to the absence of concentration data for the study site, as well as the absence of
information on the rate constants for these reactions. As a result, we report the total production of GOM, which would exceed
the resulting concentrations of GOM.

245

We selected simulation conditions and rate constants that bias our simulations towards high production of GOM. Specifically,
we used the highest values of reactant concentrations reported by Peleg et al.: [Hg(0)] = 2.6 ng m-3 (7.8 × 106 molecule cm-3),
[NO3] = 430 ng m-3 (4.2 × 109 molecule cm-3), and [O3] = 200 µg m-3 (2.1 × 1012 molecule cm-3). We also simulated 12 hours
of reaction time for these summer nights. Despite these choices biasing the simulation to overestimate GOM production, GOM
production over 12 hours was only 1.8 × 104 molecule cm-3 (6.0 pg m-3), which is much less than the average observed [GOM]

250

of 24 pg m-3, let alone the peak values of > 90 pg m-3. Note that the rate of GOM production in this case is proportional to
[GEM] × [NO3] × [O3]; by using the maximum concentrations of all three species, we artificially overestimate GOM production
by a factor of 20 relative to the obsevations. Furthermore, the simulations held [GEM], [NO3], and [O3] constant, whereas
Peleg et al., (2015) reported concentrations varying considerably during a single night. In addition, we used k2 = k10 = 10-10
cm3 molecule-1 s-1, that is, near the collision limit. This value may not be unreasonable for k10 (Castro et al., 2022; Gómez

255

Martín et al., 2022), but it exceeds the rate constants for the analogous reactions forming BrHg (Donohoue et al., 2006) and
HOHg (Pal and Ariya, 2004; Sommar et al., 2001) by factors of ~300 and ~1000, respectively (at 1 atm near 298 K). Given
all these factors the factor of 5 uncertainty in Kc cannot have caused the discrepancy between our results and the observations
of Peleg et al., (2015). Finally, the KCl denuder used to trap GOM is now known to underestimate the true concentriaton of
GOM by a factor of two to four (Dunham-Cheatham et al., 2023; Gustin et al., 2024) So the true [GOM] was likely much

260

higher than that reported.
As a result, we conclude that gas-phase reaction of NO3 with GEM contributed very little to formation of the GOM observed
by Peleg et al (2015). One might invoke surface reactions to explain their observations, especially considering that surface
reactions dominated the loss of GEM in the experiment of Sommar, et al (1997). However, the surface-to-volume ratios of 2.7
cm-1 and 1.3 cm-1 in their experiments greatly exceeds those in aerosols or the outdoor environment. Recalling our arguments,

265

above, that NO3 could not have measurably increased the rate of Hg(I) oxidation to gaseous Hg(II), it is hard to see how NO3
could have played any appreciable role in generating the GOM observed by Peleg et al.

4. Conclusions
We find the NO3-Hg bond energy, D0, to be only 6.5 kcal mol-1, leading to an equilibrium constant of only 6.5 × 10-20 cm3
molecule-1 at 298 K. While this bond energy is slightly higher than that previously calculated, it so low that NO3Hg(I)• is likely
270

to fall apart very rapidly. Our kinetic analysis demonstrates that gas phase oxidation of Hg(0) initiated by nitrate radical was
too slow to contribute significantly to loss of Hg(0) in the experiment of Sommar et al. (1997) or the field study of Peleg et al.
(2015). This holds true even if we assume that association of NO3 with Hg(0) occurs with a rate constant comparable to the
collision limit. This means that one cannot rely on the upper limit reported by Sommar et al. (1997). The fact that [O3] ≈ 1000
[NO3] in the field work of Peleg et al. (2015), along with the barrier to association of NO3Hg(I)• with NO3, means that NO3

275

cannot have significantly increased the rate of oxidation of NO3Hg(I)• to GOM. Consequently, the correlation between [NO3]
and [GOM] found by Peleg et al. (2015) did not result from the involvement of nitrate radicals in nighttime oxidation of
mercury.
Given that [O3] usually greatly exceeds the summed concentration of radicals in the atmosphere, we conclude one can
reasonably approximate the rate of oxidation of NO3Hg(I)• to Hg(II) as being proportional to k10[O3]. Given the low equilibrium

280

constant for formation of NO3Hg(I)•, it would require very high [O3] × [NO3] for NO3 to initiate significant gas-phase oxidation
of GEM to GOM near 298 K. Our results do not rule out the participation of NO3 in initiating oxidation of GEM to GOM
under the colder conditions of the middle and upper troposphere. The potential impact of this oxidation route on mercury redox
chemistry in the global atmosphere is difficult to assess without carrying out a global modeling study, which is beyond the
scope of this paper.
