ABSTRACT
We estimate the emission density of directly emitted (primary) nitrogen oxides (NOX) and fine
particulate matter (PM2.5) from on-road vehicle traffic for each census block in the United States
(U.S.) and use these data as a new spatially refined and computationally efficient exposure
surrogate. Our analysis using block level emission density estimates reveals in new detail the
widespread extent of vehicle traffic emission exposure hotspots, the large impact of medium- and
heavy-duty truck traffic on exposure, and environmental justice concerns that encompass nearly
every county in the U.S. We find that emissions from trucks contribute to 46% of NOX and
50.4% of PM2.5 exposure from vehicle traffic in the U.S. We also find statistically significant
associations between where greater proportions of people of color or people with lower incomes
and higher traffic emission exposures in over 88% of the counties in the U.S. The magnitude of
these disparities is often substantial. Our findings are notable in that traffic related emission
exposure hotspots and related exposure inequalities are not limited to just the large metropolitan
areas that have been the focus of much of the prior transportation and air quality literature. They
are in fact much more widespread than previously shown.

INTRODUCTION
On-road vehicle traffic is a major source of hazardous air pollutant emissions in the United
States (U.S.), disproportionately affecting communities of color and those with lower incomes.
Numerous studies have shown that these populations are exposed to higher levels of trafficrelated air pollution (TRAP), particularly within a few hundred meters of major roadways, where
TRAP emission hotspots have been shown to occur.1,2 Proximity to high-traffic roads is
associated with increased risks of adverse health outcomes, including respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases, as evidenced by numerous health effect studies.3–6 A systematic review
by the Health Effects Institute (2022) underscores strong evidence of TRAP exposure leading to
increased mortality and health issues such as asthma and lung cancer.7 Racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic disparities in TRAP exposure in the U.S. are well-documented8–11 and persist
despite overall reductions in vehicle emissions12–14, exacerbating health disparities in
underserved communities.
Recent research also highlights the significant contributions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle
(MDV and HDV) traffic to TRAP exposure and exposure disparities. Despite making up a
smaller proportion of vehicle traffic, MDV and HDV traffic disproportionately contributes to
TRAP exposure because their fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission
rates are much higher than those from light-duty vehicles (LDVs).15–19 In addition, HDV traffic
tends to be concentrated in urban and freight corridors, which further deepens exposure
disparities in disadvantaged communities.9,20,21
In epidemiological studies and exposure equity and environmental justice (EJ) screening tools
such as EJScreen22, proximity to high-traffic roads and traffic density are commonly used as
surrogates to estimate TRAP exposure8,11,23, given the challenges of directly measuring these
emissions. While these surrogates offer practical advantages for large-scale assessments, they
fail to capture critical factors that influence vehicle emission rates. Air quality models—
including chemical transport models (CTMs) and dispersion models—can provide more accurate
estimates of pollutant concentrations by incorporating meteorological conditions and the
photochemical processes that drive the formation of secondary pollutants. However, these
models are computationally intensive and often produce estimates at spatial resolutions that are
too coarse to identify near-roadway exposure hotspots, limiting their utility in large-scale studies
of near-roadway exposure to TRAP and associated exposure disparities.24–28
The existing literature consistently shows racial, ethnic, and income-based disparities in TRAP
exposure. Studies report that Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations experience both higher
levels of traffic-related pollution29–31 and worse health outcomes7,32 when compared to White
populations. A recent review by Mustansar et al. (2025), which examines 55 studies on air
pollution exposure by ethnic groups in high-income countries, finds that minority ethnic groups
in the U.S. are more exposed to air pollutants, including PM2.5 and NO2.30 Despite clear evidence
of exposure disparities and the important role of truck traffic, few national-scale studies quantify
the contributions of different types of vehicle traffic to exposure and equity.9,10 Furthermore,
many studies rely on spatially coarse resolution data, such as county-level aggregates from the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI). While useful

for identifying broad trends, this resolution is too coarse to evaluate exposure to TRAP hotspots
that drive public health and EJ concerns, especially near roads with high traffic volume.
Moreover, few studies evaluate and statistically assess exposure disparities across racial, ethnic,
and socioeconomic groups at subnational scales in national scale studies.
This study aims to: (1) develop a refined primary (directly emitted) vehicle emission exposure
surrogate to improve national-scale vehicle emissions exposure assessments; (2) evaluate nearroadway TRAP exposure equity, with a focus on historically underserved populations; and (3)
quantify the contributions of different vehicle types to TRAP exposure and exposure disparities.
To achieve this, we introduce a novel "vehicle emission density" approach, which provides a
continuous, fine-scale metric with nationwide coverage. This method overcomes key limitations
of existing approaches, offering a more comprehensive analysis of near-roadway emissions
exposure while reducing computational complexity and burden. By leveraging a unique national
traffic dataset that provides average traffic volumes for most roads in the U.S. and the EPA’s
Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), we estimate emission density values for every
census block in the U.S., enabling a more precise evaluation of exposure to emissions from
LDVs, MDVs, and HDVs. This approach improves upon previous methods, which often rely on
coarser proximity-based or traffic density measures, by offering greater spatial resolution in
exposure assessments. Our focus on primary emissions—NOX and PM2.5—is crucial, as these
pollutants create localized hotspots near roadways, posing significant health risks, especially in
communities with higher concentrations of lower-income populations and people of color. NOX
and PM2.5 are linked to a range of adverse health effects and are major contributors to pollution
in urban and freight corridors.
This research refines near-roadway emission exposure surrogates, balancing between spatial
precision and computational efficiency. The vehicle emission density method captures variations
in emission rates driven by factors such as climate, vehicle maintenance, and traffic patterns. It
also differentiates emissions from LDV, MDV, and HDV traffic on individual roadway
segments. By calculating emission densities at the census block level, this approach enables a
more nuanced understanding of exposure and highlights disparities across national, state, and
local levels, offering key insights to assess equity in TRAP exposure and inform policies to
reduce these disparities.
METHODS
To assess exposure to near-roadway hotspots and evaluate exposure equity, we first estimate the
emission density for primary NOX and PM2.5 emissions at the census block level, stratified by
vehicle type (LDV, MDV, and HDV). This approach builds upon and refines the traffic density
methodologies used in our previous studies.8,11,33 Emission factors are derived from the U.S.
EPA’s MOVES, and vehicle activity data are obtained from the Federal Highway
Administration’s (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS).
The emission density metric sums the emissions from vehicle traffic on roadway links that fall
within each U.S. census block, including a 250-meter buffer surrounding the block. Emissions
are then normalized by the block area to obtain a density value in grams per square kilometer

(g/km²). We compute separate emission densities for LDV, MDV, and HDV traffic to capture the
distinct contributions of each vehicle class to local air quality.
We define emission exposure as the population-weighted mean emission density within a defined
geographic area. To evaluate exposure equity, we compare average emission exposure levels
across demographic groups, group blocks into deciles based on emission density, and apply
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to assess the relationship between emission
density and census block demographics at the county level. These methods enable us to evaluate
disparities in TRAP exposure across the U.S. by integrating high-resolution spatial data with
demographic information, providing a robust assessment of both exposure levels and equity.
HPMS Data
We use vehicle activity data from the 2018 HPMS managed by the U.S. FHWA.34 This publicly
accessible and comprehensive dataset is based on annual traffic counts collected by states across
highways, arterials, and collector roadways. While the HPMS provides valuable insights into
national transportation patterns, it lacks comprehensive coverage for MDVs and HDVs,
particularly on lower-volume road not included in the U.S. highway system. Approximately 28%
of HPMS road links, representing 47% of total lane-kilometers, do not have MDV and HDV
annual average daily traffic (AADT) data, with availability varying across states due to
differences in traffic counting technologies and reporting practices. To address these gaps, we
developed a random forest regression model to estimate MDV and HDV traffic volumes on
roadways where these data were missing. Details of the model development, fitting procedure,
and validation of the estimated MDV and HDV traffic data are provided in our prior work.33
Emission Modeling and Exposure Analysis
We use version 3 of the MOVES35, developed by the U.S. EPA, to construct county-specific
emission factor look-up tables. Given the substantial computational requirements for modeling
annual average daily emissions at the road link level across the U.S. using MOVES, we develop
a streamlined approach. This approach involves selectively running MOVES for representative
counties that represent unique combinations of model parameters for January and July, following
a method similar to that used in the 2017 NEI by the EPA.36 January and July are selected to
represent winter and summer conditions , and the resulting emission factors are averaged to
reflect annual conditions.
We develop MOVES modeling scenarios for representative counties by integrating multiple
datasets. First, we extract county-level average temperature and humidity values for January and
July from the MOVES default database. These values are derived from the National Climatic
Data Center's average temperature records spanning 2001 to 2011, ensuring comprehensive
coverage across U.S. counties. We also gather data on county-specific MOVES fuel regions and
vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs, which vary considerably between urban and
rural areas—particularly in regions designated as air quality nonattainment areas. Across the
U.S., we identify 117 unique combinations of fuel types and I/M programs. Subsequently, we
merge these datasets to identify distinct Climate-Fuel-I/M combinations. We round temperature

and humidity values to the nearest 10°F and 10%, respectively, to reduce the number of unique
combinations while retaining key meteorological variation.
In total, we identify 444 unique Climate-Fuel-I/M combinations. For combinations that include
only one or two counties, we model each county individually. For all other combinations, we
model two representative counties—one urban and one rural—to account for minor differences
in model parameters that vary with the level of urbanization. To select representative counties,
we use 2020 U.S. Census population data37 and identify the most populous county and the
county closest to the 25th percentile in population size within each Climate–Fuel–I/M group.
This selection process results in 479 counties modeled in total, representing approximately 15%
of all U.S. counties. The modeling process takes about 50 hours to complete on a desktop
workstation.
We run MOVES in inventory mode for the year 2018 using default data inputs for all 479
counties modeled. We model primary NOX and PM2.5 emissions from running exhaust and PM2.5
emissions from brake and tire wear. We derive distance-based emission factors (g/m) by dividing
the total county-level emissions by the corresponding vehicle distance traveled for each
combination of emission source type (i.e., vehicle type) and road type (i.e., urban or rural,
restricted or unrestricted). This yields a database of average daily NOX and PM2.5 emission
factors by MOVES Climate–Fuel–I/M group, road type, and vehicle class.
Emission factors from our database are matched to each roadway segment in the HPMS dataset
and used to estimate annual average daily emissions from each segment. We first classify all
U.S. counties as urban or rural using the 2013 USDA County-level Rural-Urban Continuum
Codes (RUCC).38 Counties with a RUCC of 8 or 9 are classified as rural; all others are classified
as urban. Next, we align MOVES source types with HPMS vehicle traffic categories. MOVES
includes 13 source types (See Table 4-1 in MOVES3 Technical Guidance39), while HPMS
classifies traffic into three broader categories. We aggregate MOVES emission factors
accordingly (see Table S.1 for the full mapping of source types to vehicle traffic categories). We
then assign a single MOVES road type to each HPMS roadway segment based on its urban/rural
classification and HPMS functional classification code (see Table S.2 for the mapping between
MOVES road types and HPMS functional classifications). Emission factors are mapped to each
roadway segment based on its Climate-Fuel-I/M group and road type. Finally, we calculate the
annual average daily emission rate (g/m/day) for each roadway segment by multiplying the
corresponding emission factor by the vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) on that segment and
dividing by the segment’s length, separately for each vehicle type and pollutant.
Next, we estimate emission densities (in g/km²) for each pollutant and vehicle type for each U.S.
census block. This process begins by creating a 250-meter spatial buffer around each census
block using GIS software. The buffer is intended to capture emissions from traffic on nearby
roadways that contribute to emissions exposure, even if the roadways do not directly intersect the
census block. Emissions from roadway segments within the buffered area (including portions of
segments that cross the buffer boundary) are summed and then divided by the area of the census

block. These block-level emission densities are then used as surrogates for evaluating emissions
exposure.
Equity Analysis
We use 2020 Census block-level population data on race and ethnicity37, along with 2016-2020
American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year data on median household income at the block
group level and poverty status at the census tract level.40 In our analysis, individuals identifying
as "White" are those who reported their race as White alone in the 2020 Census, while "nonWhite" encompasses all other racial identities. The "other race" category includes individuals
who self-identify as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Native Hawaiian and Other
Pacific Islander alone, or another race not categorized as Black or Asian alone. The Hispanic or
Latino category includes individuals of Hispanic or Latino origin, regardless of race. Median
household income for each census block is assigned from its corresponding block group, while
poverty status (i.e., population living below the federal poverty level) is assigned from its
corresponding census tract.
To assess emission exposure equity, we classify each census block into deciles based on its
emission density for each pollutant. These deciles range from blocks with the lowest emission
density (decile 1) to the highest (decile 10), with each decile containing an equal number of
census blocks. For each decile, we calculate the proportion of the population by race, ethnicity,
and poverty level, as well as the population-weighted average median household income. This
comparative analysis allows us to examine disparities in vehicle emission exposure across
demographic groups.
We also estimate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to evaluate the direction,
strength, and statistical significance of the relationship between emission density (exposure) and
two demographic indicators: the percentage of the population that is non-White and the median
household income. Separate models are fit for each U.S. county (excluding a few counties with
few populated areas) for each vehicle type and pollutant, resulting in a total of 49,824 individual
models.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The geographic distribution of NOX and PM2.5 emission densities across the U.S. in 2018 reveals
substantial variations by emission source. As shown in Figure 1, distinct patterns emerge in
census block-level NOX and PM2.5 emissions originating from LDV, MDV, and HDV traffic
across the U.S. Emissions density from LDV traffic is most concentrated in urban areas, where
greater population density results in higher LDV traffic volume. Emission density from HDV
traffic, on the other hand, is more dispersed, with high emission densities observed in both urban
areas and along highway corridors connecting urban centers, extending into rural regions. The
geographic distribution of emission density from MDV traffic falls between the patterns seen for
LDV and HDV traffic, with higher emission density values generally concentrated in urban areas
and along select highway corridors.

Figure 1. Census block-level emission density across the U.S. categorized by type of vehicle
traffic. Panels (A-C) display NOX emissions density (g/km2) from light-duty vehicles (LDV),
medium-duty vehicles (MDV), and heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), respectively. Panels (D-F)
show PM2.5 emissions density (g/km2) from LDV, MDV, and HDV traffic, respectively.

Next, we evaluate population exposure to NOX and PM2.5 from vehicle traffic. Population
exposure is defined as the population-weighted mean emission density and is estimated for each
county and for the U.S. using the 2018 block-level emission densities shown in Figure 1, along
with block-level population data from the 2020 Census.
Exposure estimates at the national level reveal that MDV and HDV traffic have a
disproportionately large impact on primary NOX and PM2.5 exposure relative to their traffic
volume. For example, while MDVs and HDVs account for only 4.3% and 6.5% of average daily
VKT in the U.S., respectively, they contribute 19.6% and 26.8% of average NOX exposure, and
24.7% and 25.7% of average PM2.5 exposure (Table 1). Together, emissions from MDV and
HDV traffic contribute to approximately half of primary NOX and PM2.5 vehicle emissions
exposure in the U.S.

While LDV and truck traffic (MDVs and HDVs) on average contribute about equally to PM2.5
exposure in the U.S., the dominant emission processes differ significantly. LDVs have relatively
low PM2.5 exhaust emission rates, which results in brake and tire wear accounting for a relatively
large share (48%) of PM2.5 emissions exposure attributable to LDV traffic (Table 2). Overall,
LDV traffic is responsible for 78.4% of exposure to PM2.5 from brake wear and 84.8% from tire
wear in the U.S. (Table 1). In contrast, exhaust emissions account for 86.7% of PM2.5 exposure
attributable to MDV traffic and 90.1% of HDV traffic (Table 2). Despite truck traffic accounting
for just 10.1% of VKT in the U.S. it is responsible for 63.1% of primary PM2.5 exposure from
vehicle exhaust (Table 1).

MDV or HDV traffic, there are large regions of the country where HDV traffic is the dominant
source of exposure (Figure 2). Notably, counties in states across the central U.S., from North
Dakota to Texas, as well as Nevada and Utah, exhibit considerably larger proportions of
emissions exposure from HDV traffic. This occurs primarily in areas where highways carry high
volumes of truck traffic through rural counties with small populations and relatively low LDV
traffic volumes. In contrast, more urbanized regions with higher population densities also have
highways with high HDV traffic volumes. However, the higher LDV and MDV traffic volumes
on these roads reduce the significance of HDV traffic in explaining overall exposure levels at the
county level. It is important to note that for individual communities (e.g., those located adjacent
to truck corridors) within urban counties, MDV and HDV vehicle traffic can still dominate
emissions exposure, even if LDV traffic is shown to be the largest source of exposure at the
county level in Figure 2. For example, the maps in Figure S.1 show the census blocks in the Los
Angeles, California and New York-New Jersey regions where truck traffic (combined MDV and
HDV traffic) accounts for more than 50% of NOX and PM2.5 emission density.

We now evaluate exposure equity across different population groups defined by race, ethnicity,
and income. On average, people of color and those living in poverty face disproportionately high
levels of exposure to primary NOX (Figure 3) and PM2.5 (Figure S.2) emissions from vehicle
traffic in the U.S. in 2020. On average, people of color in the U.S. are exposed to approximately
twice the amount of NOX and PM2.5 emissions from vehicle traffic compared to the White
population. This trend holds across all non-White population groups examined. Among racial
groups, the Asian population experiences the highest average exposure from LDV and MDV
traffic, while the Black population faces the greatest exposure from HDV traffic.
Individuals living in poverty are also exposed to significantly higher levels of vehicle emissions.
On average, they experience roughly twice the exposure to primary NOX and PM2.5 emissions
from LDV and MDV traffic compared to the population that is above the poverty level in the
U.S. in 2020 (Figure 3 and Figure S.2). This disparity is even more pronounced for HDV
traffic, with individuals living in poverty experiencing roughly three times the primary NOX and
PM2.5 emissions compared to the population above the poverty level. On average, a person living
in poverty is exposed to 200% (three times) more primary NOX and PM2.5 emissions from HDV
traffic, and about 80% to 100% (approximately twice as much) more from MDV and LDV
traffic, than the average person in the U.S.

block level emission density estimates. Vehicle traffic types include light-duty vehicle

exposure values, refer to Table S.3.

Next, we delve deeper into exposure equity by examining how the demographic characteristics
of populations vary across areas with different levels of primary NOX and PM2.5 emission
densities from LDV, MDV, and HDV traffic. We sort U.S. census blocks into ten equally sized
bins (i.e., deciles) based on their emission densities for each vehicle type. The first decile
contains census blocks with the lowest emission density values, while the tenth decile contains
those with the highest (Figure 4 and Figure S.3). Emission densities vary widely across deciles,
with the median census block NOX and PM2.5 emission densities within each decile spanning
several orders of magnitude, as shown in Table S.4.
The results shown in Figure 4 and Figure S.4 reveal substantial disparities across exposure
deciles. For instance, in the lowest NOX emission density decile, non-White individuals
constitute only 17% of the population, whereas in the highest decile they make up 56% of the
population—a 39 percentage point increase (Figure 4.B). Similar trends are evident when we
disaggregate the non-While population into specific race and ethnicity groups (Figure 4.C-F).
For example, in the highest NOX emission density decile, the proportion of Black individuals is
3.3 times, Asian individuals 6.1 times, and Hispanic or Latino individuals 4.0 times greater than
in the lowest decile.
Disparities are also notable with respect to income and poverty (Figure 4.G-H). The poverty rate
increases from 12.2% in the lowest NOX decile to 17.1% in the highest—a 4.9 percentage point
(40.5%) increase. While the relationship between median household income and emission
density deciles is non-linear (households in very low emission density areas often have lower
incomes, attributable to lower earning in very rural areas but not necessarily greater poverty) the
results clearly indicate a strong association between lower median income and higher emissions
exposure.

Figure 4. The relationship between race, ethnicity, poverty status, income, and NOX
emission density by type of vehicle traffic in the U.S. Panels (A) through (G) illustrate the
percentage of the population residing within each emission density decile, categorized as
White alone, non-White alone, Black alone, Asian alone, some other non-White race alone
(not Black or Asian), Hispanic or Latino, and living below the federal poverty level. Panel
(H) displays the population-weighted average median household income (in $1,000s) of the
population residing within each emission density decile. Vehicle traffic types include lightduty vehicle (LDV), medium-duty vehicle (MDV), and heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) traffic.
For median census block emission densities (VKT/km2) by decile and type of vehicle traffic,
refer to Table S.4.

These disparities are also observed—and of similar magnitude—when evaluated by vehicle
traffic type (LDV, MDV, and HDV), as shown in Figure 4. It is important to note that the census
blocks within each exposure decile vary by vehicle traffic type. For example, a particular census
block may fall into decile 3 based on emission density from LDV traffic but into decile 6 based
on HDV traffic emissions. Trends very similar to those described for NOX are also observed for

Figure 5. Linear regression model slope coefficients for NOX emission density as a function
of U.S. census block level (A-C) non-White population share and (D-F) median household
income by vehicle traffic type for each U.S. county. Vehicle traffic types include light-duty
vehicle (LDV), medium-duty vehicle (MDV), and heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) traffic.
Hatched areas indicate counties where slope estimates are statistically insignificant at the
95% confidence level (p > 0.05).
Next, we examine how exposure disparities by race and income vary across the U.S. Figure 5
displays the coefficient estimates (i.e., slope) from county-level linear regression models where
block-level emission density is modeled as a function of either the percentage of the block
population this is non-White or the block’s median household income. The coefficient estimates
indicate the change in emission density (g/km2) associated with a 1% increase in the non-White
population share or a $1 increase in median household income. For example, counties shaded red
in Figure 5.A-C indicate a statistically significant positive association between a higher
proportion of non-White residents and higher NOX emission densities. In contrast, counties
shaded blue in Figure 5.D-F indicate a statistically significant negative association between
higher median household incomes and NOX emission densities. Counties with statistically
insignificant coefficient estimates (p > 0.05, based on a 95% confidence interval) are shown with
hatching in Figure 5. For the corresponding analysis of PM2.5 emissions, refer to Figure S.4.
We find that 78.9% of counties exhibit a statistically significant relationship between total NOX
emission density and the percentage of the population that is non-White based on all vehicle
traffic (LDV 79.9%, MDV 79.1%, and HDV 74.3%). Similarly, 77.6% of counties demonstrate a
statistically significant relationship between total NOX emission density and median household
income (LDV 79.5%, MDV 79.4%, and HDV 71.9%). Similar patterns are observed for PM2.5
emission density, non-white population, and median household income. See Figure S.5 in the
Supplemental Information for a detailed presentation of the box plots illustrating the distribution
of linear regression model coefficient estimates and coefficients of determination (R²) for NOₓ
and PM₂.₅ across U.S. counties.

The maps in Figure 5 and Figure S.4 reveal significant and widespread disparities in exposure
to NOX and PM2.5 emissions from vehicle traffic across the U.S. in 2020. Across all regions,
there is a positive and statistically significant association between the share of non-White people
and NOX and PM2.5 emission density (red shading), with very few instances of a negative
association (blue shading) (Figure 5.A-C and Figure S.4.A-C). Similarly, there is a negative and
statistically significant association between median household income and NOX and PM2.5
emission density (blue shading) throughout the U.S., with few counties showing a positive
association (red shading) (Figure 5.D-F and Figure S.4.D-F). Counties with no statistically
significant association (p > 0.05) are generally rural areas with very small populations (shown
with hatching).
The disparities displayed in Figure 5 are striking, as they are observed in the majority of U.S.
counties, including those that do not contain large cities or are predominantly rural. LDV and
HDV traffic are the primary drivers of the most pronounced inequities (indicated by the darker
shading on the maps), though MDV traffic also contributes significantly in some areas. One of
the most notable differences across the various maps in Figure 5 lies between those illustrating
racial and income-based disparities. Emission exposure disparities affecting non-White
populations are generally largest in the most urbanized areas of the U.S. (e.g., the Northeast and
West Coast regions), whereas disparities related to lower income populations are more
commonly observed outside of the largest urban centers.

Note. NOX = nitrogen oxides; PM2.5 = fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less
than or equal to 2.5 micrometers; All = all vehicle traffic; LDV = light-duty vehicle; MDV =
medium-duty vehicle; HDV = heavy-duty vehicle. Race disparity is defined as counties with a
statistically significant (p < 0.05) and positive correlation between census block emission density
and the non-White population share. Income disparity is defined as counties with a statistically
significant (p < 0.05) and negative correlation between census block traffic density and the
median household income. Percentages are calculated out of the total number of counties,
parishes, and county equivalents across all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. (n = 3,143).

Table 3 quantifies the prevalence of disparities in exposure to NOX and PM2.5 emissions from
vehicle traffic by race and income in U.S. counties in 2020. A race disparity is defined as a
statistically significant (p < 0.05), positive correlation between census block emission density
and the non-White population share. An income disparity is defined as a statistically significant,
negative correlation between emission density and median household income.
Overall, we find that statistically significant disparities in exposure to NOX and PM2.5 emissions
from vehicle traffic are present across racial and income groups in a large majority of U.S.
counties. Specifically, race-based disparities in exposure to both pollutants are observed in 78%
of counties (see Table 3). Income-based disparities are observed in 70% of counties for NOX and
71% for PM2.5 (Table 3). Disparities based on either race or income are evident in nearly all
counties—88% and 89%, respectively. Similar patterns hold when disaggregating emissions by
vehicle type (LDV, MDV, and HDV).
In this study, we introduce a refined surrogate for assessing exposure to primary (direct) vehicle
traffic emissions near roadways. The emission density surrogate enables a more spatially detailed

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-lmx3n-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-6457-142X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

and source-specific evaluation of near-roadway emissions exposures, revealing in new detail the
widespread extent of exposure hotspots, the large impact of medium- and heavy-duty truck
traffic, and environmental justice concerns that affect nearly every county in the U.S. This
approach also allows for rapid analysis of flexible user-defined areas, such as individual
neighborhoods. Our findings are notable in that exposure hotspots and associated inequalities are
not limited to large metropolitan areas, which have historically been the focus of transportation
and air quality research. High levels of exposure and significant environmental justice concerns
are present in all types of communities. Additionally, the significant role of truck traffic is an
important finding, as mitigating these emissions (e.g., through fleet electrification) is expected to
be more challenging for trucks than for light-duty passenger vehicles.
It is important to note that this analysis is limited to roadways with functional classifications 1
through 6. Residential streets in urban areas and low volume roadways in rural areas (functional
classification 7 in the HPMS dataset) are excluded due to the lack of available HPMS traffic data
for these roadways. This omission may lead to underestimation of exposure in specific contexts.
For example, intermodal freight facilities, warehouses and port facilities that are embedded
within residential neighborhoods may generate high volumes of truck traffic on local streets used
to access them. For example, the Chicago Truck Counts initiative41, found high volumes of truck
activity on local streets near freight facilities in the Chicago, Illinois region. As such, our
findings on exposure disparities are likely conservative in these areas, and actual exposure
burdens—particularly those relevant to environmental justice—may be even more pronounced.
The surrogate approach developed in this study can also inform future research and policy
decisions. While we have conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of current conditions, emission
density can be used to track exposure changes over time and adapted for planning and
forecasting applications. For example, it is relatively straightforward and computationally
minimal to recalculate block-level emission density values to represent future scenarios where
vehicle emission rates or traffic volumes are different from current levels. Our block-level
emission density estimates can also serve as more spatially refined inputs for chemical transport
and photochemical air quality modeling.
