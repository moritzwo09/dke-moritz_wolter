Abstract
The abatement of aromatic pollutants in water requires resource-intensive oxidation to nontoxic
products by hydroxyl radicals (•OH). In this study, we elucidate the mechanisms of •OH-induced
aromatic ring degradation by combining kinetic measurements, electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and kinetic modelling. We demonstrate that
benzyl alcohol, a model aromatic compound, is oxidized by •OH radicals, generated by ultrasonic
irradiation in an O2-rich environment, into aromatic compounds (benzaldehyde and phenol derivatives)
and C1-C2 oxygenates (formic acid, glyoxal, and oxalic acid). Through pathways akin to atmospheric
chemistry, these •OH radicals de-aromatize and fragment benzyl alcohol, producing 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal and other dicarbonyl products. Unique to the aqueous phase, however, superoxide (•O2–) is
generated as a byproduct of •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions. •O2– acts as a potent nucleophile, oxidizing
5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal into oxalic acid and C1 oxygenates via aldehyde and ketone intermediates.
This process regenerates •O2– and does not consume •OH, thereby further degrading ring fragmentation
products while preserving •OH to activate the refractory aromatic ring of benzyl alcohol. These
nucleophilic •O2– reactions can therefore reduce the energy and chemical demands needed to degrade
aromatic compounds, thus promoting the sustainable and scalable application of •OH-based oxidation
processes in water treatment.

1. Introduction
Benzene and its derivatives (e.g., phenylacetic acid, ibuprofen) are contaminants of municipal1–
4

, industrial5,6, and agricultural2 wastewaters. The adverse consequences of these aromatic compounds

for human and ecological health3,7 necessitates their removal from wastewater streams before discharge
or reuse. Aromatic compounds resist oxidation by biochemical processes 8,9 and chemical oxidants8–10
(e.g., ozone, chlorine, hypochlorite) typically used in wastewater treatment. They can however be
degraded by hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which are generated in advanced oxidation processes11 by
dissociating H2O2 with ultraviolet radiation10–12 or with Fenton reactions11,13, or by dissociating H2O in
gas cavities using ultrasound irradiation14–18.
Advanced oxidation processes incur substantial operational costs from chemical inputs (e.g.,
H2O2) and energy required to generate •OH from H2O or sacrificial reagents19–22. A mechanistic
understanding of aromatic ring oxidation by •OH can inform strategies to reduce the quantities of •OH
needed to degrade aromatic compounds into biodegradable products10,21,23. Aqueous aromatic
compounds (e.g., benzene24,25 and toluene26) are oxidized by •OH through ring cleavage into
biodegradable short-chain dicarbonyl products (e.g. glyoxal24,26, methylglyoxal26) and carboxylic acid
products (e.g. formic acid24,26 and acetic acid26). These fragmentations are proposed to occur through
mechanisms24,26 (Scheme 1) that resemble those established in gas-phase chemistry27–33. Gas-phase
benzene fragmentation, for instance, begins with •OH addition to the aromatic ring, followed by
reaction with O2 to form a bicyclic peroxyl radical intermediate (step 1, Scheme 1). The bicyclic
peroxyl radical undergoes a chain of radical reaction steps that cleaves two C-C bonds, yielding one
stoichiometric equivalent of glyoxal (a α-carbonyl-aldehyde) and butenedial (a γ-carbonyl-alk-2-enal)
or its epoxide (step 2, Scheme 1)28. Substituted benzene derivatives (e.g., toluene and benzyl alcohol)
convert into analogs of the benzene-derived fragments, with the substituent replacing one of the C-H
groups (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1: Steps for de-aromatization and fragmentation of a “X”-substituted benzene derivative. These
fragmentations form a set of isomeric products with the X-function located at either R1, R2, and R3
positions. The location of X in the products depends on its initial ring location relative to the location
where •OH adds to the phenyl ring, and to the points of C-C cleavage. A comprehensive sequence of
elementary steps for such fragmentation and an enumeration of different isomers formed are shown for
benzyl alcohol (X=CH2OH) in Figures 3 and S1, respectively.

In contrast with the fragmentation of aromatic compounds in the gas phase27–33, organic acids
(e.g., formic acid24,26 and acetic acid26) are formed as primary products during the fragmentation of
aromatic compounds in the aqueous phase. This difference in selectivity to organic acids between
aqueous- and gas-phase reactions suggests that solvation by water influences the mechanisms of
fragmentation in the aqueous phase26. Intermediates formed during •OH-initiated aromatic
fragmentation react with O2 via hydrogen transfer, generating hydroperoxyl radicals (•OOH) as a byproduct27,28,31. In aqueous solutions, •OOH equilibrates with its conjugate base, superoxide (•O2–)34,35.
•O2– has been reported to react as a nucleophile in substitution36,37, addition37, and elimination37
reactions in aprotic solvents, and in addition reactions to the aldehyde function of glyoxal in aqueous
solution38. Tts nucleophilicity suggests that it can attack the electrophilic α-β unsaturated carbonyl
functions of γ-carbonyl-alk-2-enals. Such an attack by •O2– could facilitate further oxidation of γcarbonyl-alk-2-enals to organic acids without requiring additional •OH initiators.
In this study, we combine computational and experimental techniques to investigate the
mechanisms of aqueous •OH-initiated aromatic ring fragmentation in an O2 environment, and the role
of •O2– therein at a pH near the point of •OOH/•O2– equilibration (4.62 at 315 K 34). Benzyl alcohol (5
mM) is used because it undergoes alcohol oxidation, aromatic substitution, and ring fragmentation

reactions28–30, making it an ideal model of aromatic compounds with diverse functional groups. The
•OH is generated by ultrasound irradiation (20 kHz), but the mechanistic insights are agnostic to the
source of •OH.
Experimental measurements of benzyl alcohol oxidation rates and density functional theory
(DFT)-based kinetic modeling show that •OH-initiated reactions fragment benzyl alcohol into 5hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal and glyoxal through established mechanisms of gas-phase chemistry27–33,
echoing proposals for other aromatic compounds24,26. These experimental and computational kinetic
investigations indicate that the 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal product of fragmentation is activated by •O2–
through conjugate addition to the α-β unsaturated carbonyl function. The adduct undergoes a radicalchain reaction that forms oxalic acid with molar yields that exceed 0.25 of the benzyl alcohol consumed.
Such reactions between •O2– and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal are infeasible in the gas-phase, which lacks
the protic solvent needed for •O2– charge stabilization. Consequently, the reactions propagated by •O2–
account for the large yields of oxalic acid from •OH-initiated benzyl alcohol oxidation in aqueous phase,
despite oxalic acid not being reported as a product from analogous reactions in the gas-phase28. •O2– is
prevalent in •OH-driven oxidations of diverse organic substrates reactions of hydrated aldehydes39–41,
alcohols41,42, organic acids41,43, and arenes24,26, suggesting a broader role of the types of •O2– reactions
with carbonyl functions reported here in water treatment. Such •O2– reactions oxidize organic molecules
with carbonyl functions without depleting •OH initiators, thereby preserving •OH to activate refractory
organic molecules. Harnessing •O2– as an oxidant can therefore reduce the costs of generating •OH in
advanced oxidation processes for treating municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewaters.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Ultrasound-derived hydroxyl radicals drive the consumption of benzyl alcohol and formation
of aromatic compounds
Aqueous benzyl alcohol oxidation by ultrasound irradiation was carried out in a doublejacketed batch reactor with continuous exposure to ultrasound waves (20 kHz; 0.27 W cm-3 at 50%
amplitude) and bubbling O2 (1 atm, 0.33 cm3 s-1; Section S1.1). Figure 1 shows the change in benzyl
alcohol concentration with time of ultrasound irradiation (5 mM initial benzyl alcohol; 315 K). The

benzyl alcohol concentration decreased linearly with time, reflecting a constant rate of consumption
(1.7×10-8 M s-1; Fig. 1). The consumption of benzyl alcohol was slower than the characteristic rate that
•OH was supplied to the aqueous solution by ultrasound-driven cavitation processes (2.6 ×10-8 M s-1),
as reported using the same reactor in our previous study38. This characteristic rate was quantified by
titrating the H2O2 product of •OH coupling reactions in the absence of an organic substrate44. The
relatively faster rate of •OH formation (2.6 ×10-8 M OH s-1) indicates that the supply of •OH is
stoichiometrically sufficient to initiate the oxidation pathways of benzyl alcohol (at 1.7×10-8 M s-1).

benzyl alcohol oxidation (Section S1.1). (b) The change in aqueous benzyl alcohol concentration and
product yields with time of exposure to continuous ultrasonic irradiation under bubbling O2 (5 mM
benzyl alcohol; 20 kHz; 315 K; Section S1.1). The purple “+” represents the benzyl alcohol
concentration with the total yield of quantified products subtracted (denoted as “BA - total yield”). The
solid and dashed lines depict fits of linear functions. Initial rates were calculated from the slope of a
linear trendline with zero intercept regressed to measurements collected within 1.1×104 s (Table S16).

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected from sonicated mixtures of
aqueous 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO; 50 mM) and benzyl alcohol (0-50 mM), to assess
whether •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions are fast enough to compete with rapid •OH-addition to DMPO.
The spectra were collected following exposure to pulsed ultrasound irradiation (3 s on, 1 s off) at 20
kHz for 1.2×103 s under flow of O2 (Section S1.2); these spectra are shown in Figure 2. The spectra of
0- and 5-mM benzyl alcohol solutions showed a predominant feature consistent with an adduct formed
by •OH addition to DMPO (denoted as DMPO/OH). This DMPO/OH signal was relatively weaker at 5
mM benzyl alcohol, and essentially undetectable at 25 and 50 mM benzyl alcohol. Such suppression of
the DMPO/OH signal with increasing benzyl alcohol concentration suggests that •OH is scavenged by
benzyl alcohol in the aqueous phase thus preventing the •OH addition to DMPO. This rapid nature of
•OH-benzyl alcohol reactions, combined with commensurate rates of •OH formation (2.6 ×10-8 M s-1
38

) and benzyl alcohol consumption (1.7×10-8 M s-1; Fig. 1), suggests that aqueous •OH-initiated

reactions are the predominant drivers of benzyl alcohol consumption during the kinetic studies of benzyl
alcohol oxidation shown in Figure 1.

solutions of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO; 50 mM) mixed with benzyl alcohol (BA) at
different concentrations (0-50 mM) following exposure to pulsed ultrasound irradiation at 20 kHz under
flow of O2 (0.33 cm3 s-1) for 1.2 ×103 s (Section S1.2). The magnetic field values corresponding to peak
values for the DMPO/OH single are denoted by the green circle. One and five scans were used to collect
the spectra for solutions with 0 and 5 mM BA and 25 and 50 mM BA, respectively.

The benzyl alcohol-•OH reactions sustained under ultrasound irradiation formed aromatic
compounds including benzaldehyde, phenol, 4-hydroxy-phenol, and hydroxymethyl-phenol isomers.
The yields of each aromatic product were between 0.020 mM and 0.047 mM after 2.2×104 s (Table
S17). The combined yield to these aromatic compounds after 2.2×104 s (0.17 mM) balanced a
significant fraction (0.47) of the benzyl alcohol consumed (0.36 mM; Fig. 1). The remaining fraction
(0.53) of benzyl alcohol consumed (0.19 mM) was thus converted into other products.

The other products include oxalic acid, which was formed at a yield (0.11 mM) that balanced
nearly one-third (0.29) of the benzyl alcohol consumed after 2.2×104 s (0.36 mM; Fig. 1). The short
linear carbon chain in oxalic acid (2 C-atoms) compared to larger cyclic C-backbone of benzyl alcohol
(7 C-atoms) indicates that oxalic acid formation from benzyl alcohol would require ring opening and
fragmentation. The plausible mechanisms for such routes from benzyl alcohol to oxalic acid are
examined in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.
Benzaldehyde, phenol, hydroxymethyl-phenol isomers, and hydroxy-phenol isomers were
reported as products from the gas-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of O2 and initiated
by •OH, which was generated by CH3ONO photolysis30,45. A proposed sequence of elementary steps
for the formation of benzaldehyde, phenol, hydroxymethyl-phenol isomers was adapted from
mechanistic studies of reactions in the gas-phase28,30,45 and shown in Scheme 2. The mechanisms for
forming 4-hydroxy-phenol were not considered because its initial rate of formation (within the first
1.2×104 s) was smaller than for the other aromatic compounds (Table S16).
Steps 1a-2a (Scheme 2) show H-transfer from benzyl alcohol to •OH (step 1a) to form
hydroxy-(phenyl)methyl•, which further reacts via hydroxy H-transfer to O2 to form benzaldehyde and
•OOH (Step 2a). Steps 1b-2b show •OH addition to benzyl alcohol at the C1 position to form 6hydroxymethyl-6-hydroxy-cyclohexadienyl• (denoted as ipso-BA/•OH; step 1b), followed by
hydroxymethyl• elimination to form phenol (step 2b). Steps 1c shows •OH addition to benzyl alcohol
at the C2, C3, or C4 positions to form 2-, 3-, or 4-hydroxymethyl-6-hydroxy-cyclohexadienyl•,
respectively (denoted as ortho-, meta-, or para-BA/•OH, respectively). In step 2c, these
cyclohexadienyl• intermediates undergo H-transfer with O2 to form •OOH and hydroxymethyl phenol
isomers. These isomers include 2-hydroxymethyl-phenol, the predominant isomer from gas-phase
reactions28,30,45, and 3- and 4-hydroxymethyl phenol isomers which were detected alongside 2hydroxymethyl-phenol in sonochemical reactions (Fig. 1).
The reactions in Scheme 2 also show that •OOH forms as a by-product through H-abstraction
by O2. Unlike in the gas-phase, •OOH deprotonates to •O2– through an acid-base equilibrium in aqueous
solutions. Such •O2– species are nucleophiles and will mediate the formation of oxalic acid, as will be
discussed in Section 2.3.

Scheme 2 also shows the changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and forward rate constants (315
K) for each elementary reaction at reaction temperature (315 K; Fig. 1), as calculated using densityfunctional theory (DFT) methods (Section S2.1-2). The DFT calculations were performed with
QChem46, using a range-separated hybrid, meta-GGA functional (ωB97M-V47) and with solute
interactions with the H2O solvent introduced implicitly using the SMD model48 (Section S2.1). Rate
constants were determined using transition-state theory49,50 and accounted for resistance to reaction
from diffusion51,52 (Section S2.2). The forward rate constants computed using DFT methods for •OHaddition to benzyl alcohol (1.3 to 2.8 ×109 M-1 s-1; Scheme 2, steps 1b,c) are comparable to those
reported from kinetic analysis of •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions using pulsed radiolysis (8.4 ×109 M-1 s1 53

) .
The rate constants for •OH-addition reactions (steps 1b and 1c; Scheme 1) were within a factor

of 3 of each other (1.1 to 2.5 ×10-9 M-1 s-1; Scheme 2), reflecting the competitive nature of •OH addition
at all locations in the ring. This observation contrasts reports in the gas phase where •OH adds
preferentially to the C1 and C2 positions due to H-bonding between the -OH function of benzyl alcohol
with the •OH moiety at the transition states for these reactions28. The relatively less selective •OH
addition at the C1 and C2 positions in the aqueous phase likely reflects the stabilizing interactions
between the •OH dipole and the implicit solvent at transition states corresponding to all of these •OH
addition reactions. These interactions with the solvent diminish the influence of H-bonding between
•OH and the hydroxymethyl group of benzyl alcohol that would otherwise favor •OH addition to the
C1 and C2 positions.
The rate constants for benzyl alcohol-•OH reactions (ki,OH,BA; Scheme 2, steps 1a,b,c) were
within 20-fold of the rate constant for diffusive encounters (kd; Table S11) between freely diffusing
•OH and either •OH, benzyl alcohol, or prevalent oxidation products (Fig. 1). Each kd value (1.12.3×1010 M-1 s-1; Table S11) represents the maximum possible rate that •OH can react with a given coreactant, assuming instantaneous reaction upon contact in solution. The large rate constants for benzyl
alcohol-•OH reactions, near their diffusion limits, aligns with interpretations of EPR measurements (Fig.
2), which indicated that •OH was rapidly scavenged by benzyl alcohol, thereby preventing •OH addition
to DMPO. The oxidation studies (Fig. 1) were conducted with excess benzyl alcohol (>4.7 mM benzyl

12

alcohol; Fig. 1) compared to the lower concentrations of predominant products (< 0.11 mM oxalic acid,
< 0.05 mM aromatic compounds; Fig. 1). The large values of ki,OH,BA indicate that rates of •OH-benzyl
alcohol reactions far exceed the rates of •OH reactions with other solutes, even when diffusion-limited,
during kinetic measurements (Fig. 1). Consequently, benzyl alcohol effectively scavenges all •OH
initiators.
The reactive nature of free radicals54 suggests that the radicals intermediates in Scheme 2 react
instantaneously once formed to establish low pseudo-steady state concentrations. A pseudo-steady-state
approximation for these radical intermediates is justified as long as pseudo-first-order rate constants for
their consumption are much larger than those for their formation from benzyl alcohol55. This
justification, based on rate constants, stems from perturbation treatments of kinetic models of chemical
reactions56.
The pseudo-first-order rate constant for benzyl alcohol consumption under ultrasonic
irradiation (3.8×10-6 s-1) was obtained by dividing the initial measured consumption rate (1.9×10-8 M s1

; Table S16) by the initial benzyl alcohol concentration (5 mM). This rate constant was 106-times

smaller than the DFT-derived first-order rate constant calculated for hydroxymethyl• elimination from
ipso-BA/•OH (1.2 s-1; step 2b; Scheme 2). It was also 108-times smaller than the DFT-derived pseudofirst-order rate constants for the reactions of hydroxy-(phenyl)-methyl• and the other benzyl alcohol•OH adducts with O2 (step 2a and 2c; Scheme 2; at 0.99 mM O2 present in equilibrium with 1 bar O2
gas). The larger calculated (pseudo-) first-order rate constants for reactions of hydroxy-(phenyl)methyl• and benzyl alcohol-•OH adducts, compared to the measured pseudo-first-order rate constant
for benzyl alcohol consumption, confirms the pseudo-steady-state nature of these radical
intermediates55,56.
The occurrence of the benzyl alcohol substitution and alcohol oxidation reactions in Scheme 2
at pseudo-steady state indicates that benzaldehyde, phenol, and hydroxymethyl-phenol isomers form
essentially instantaneously once benzyl alcohol is activated by •OH. The pseudo-steady-state nature of
these reactions, taken together with the measured rate of •OH formation (2.6 ×10-8 M s-1 38) being
sufficient to drive measured rates of benzyl alcohol consumption (1.9×10-8 M s-1; Table S16), suggests
that the predominant aromatic products form via •OH-initiated reactions of benzyl alcohol.

The •OH-benzyl alcohol adducts, formed as intermediates in pathways to phenol and hydroxymethyl
phenol isomers (steps 1b-2b and 1c-2c; Scheme 2), can also react with O2 through addition to their
rings. The addition of O2 to •OH adducts of various aromatic compounds has been implicated in
pathways for fragmenting aromatic compounds into dicarbonyl products in the gas-phase27,28,31–33,45,57–

. The fragmentation of benzyl alcohol through such mechanisms yields one stoichiometric

equivalent of an α-carbonyl-aldehyde (i.e., glyoxal or 3-hydroxy-2-oxopropanal) and a γ-carbonylalk-2-enal (i.e., but-2-enedial, 2-hydroxymethyl-but-2-enedial, or 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pent-2-enal) or the
epoxide form of the γ-carbonyl-alk-2-enal28. The specific product pair depends on the locations of the
•OH and O2 additions to the benzyl alcohol ring relative to the hydroxymethyl function, as shown in
Scheme S1.
A calculation of the average oxidation state for C-atoms in oxalic acid based on formal charges
gives a value of 3, which is closer to that for carbonyl-aldehyde fragmentation products (0 for δcarbonyl-alk-2-enals and 0.4 to 0.5 for their epoxides) than for benzyl alcohol (-0.86). This comparison
between oxidation states implies that the conversion of fragmentation products to oxalic acid requires
fewer further oxidation reactions than the conversion of benzyl alcohol to oxalic acid. These carbonylaldehyde intermediates therefore constitute plausible intermediates in pathways that form oxalic acid
from benzyl alcohol reactants when exposed to ultrasonic irradiation, provided that the mechanisms
that form them in the gas-phase27,28,31–33,45,57–59 are also prevalent in the aqueous phase.

The fragmentation of benzyl alcohol-•OH adducts is mediated by peroxyl radicals formed
through O2 addition to the ring at vicinal locations to the -OH function27,28,59. Scheme 3 shows such O2
additions to ipso-, ortho-, meta-, and para-BA/•OH (steps 2a-5a) and their rate constants calculated
with DFT-based methods (Section S2). O2 additions to ortho-, meta-, and para-BA/•OH (steps 3a-5a)
are shown to occur at the anti-position (i.e., with O2 adding to the ring opposite to the -OH function)
instead of the syn-position (i.e., with O2 adding to the same side of the ring as the -OH function). This
reflects the preference for anti-O2 addition to •OH adducts of aromatic compounds, which is evident
from a lower free energy barrier calculated for anti-O2 addition to benzene (ΔG‡; 47 kJ mol-1) than for
syn-O2 addition (73 kJ mol-1; Section S3). Steps 3a and 4a show O2 addition to ortho- and meta-

BA/•OH at the 5 positions, instead of the 1 position, to minimize steric hindrance from the
hydroxymethyl function. O2 addition to ipso-BA/•OH (step 2a) is shown with -OO and -OH functions
in the syn-conformation, reflecting the lower barrier to form this conformer compared with the anticounterpart28.
Scheme 3 also shows the substitution reactions of these same benzyl alcohol-•OH adducts
(steps 2b-5b) and their forward rate constants. The rate constant calculated for O2 addition to ipsoBA/•OH (step 2a) is 67 times smaller than that of unimolecular hydroxymethyl• elimination (step 2b);
therefore, O2 addition occurs at rates that are negligible at O2 concentrations prevalent under
sonochemical conditions (0.99 mM O2 in equilibrium with flowing O2 at 1 bar60). The forward rate
constants for O2 addition to ortho-, meta-, and para-BA/•OH (steps 3a-5a), in contrast, were 2, 5, and
3 times smaller, respectively, than rate constants for H-transfer reactions of these same adducts (steps
3b-5b). The similar magnitude of rate constants for these O2 addition and H-transfer reactions with
ortho-, meta-, and para-BA/•OH reflects significant competition between these pathways.
DFT-based methods with implicit H2O solvation (described in Sections S2) were used to assess
whether the adducts formed by O2 addition to BA/•OH intermediates fragment in the aqueous phase
through the same mechanisms that prevail in the gas-phase28. Fragmentation through the ortho-BA/•OH
intermediate was considered because it has the largest ratio between rate constants for O2 addition and
H-transfer among the •OH adducts (Scheme 3), and therefore most likely to fragment. The sequence of
elementary steps for ortho-BA/•OH fragmentation to glyoxal and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal is shown
in Figure 3, along with the free energy changes (ΔG) and free energy barriers (ΔG‡) for each step. The
overall reaction occurs with a large negative free energy change (-529 kJ mol-1), reflecting a significant
thermodynamic driving force.
Steps 1-4 (Fig. 3b) show the conversion of benzyl alcohol, •OH, and 2 O2 into a bicyclic radical
intermediate (denoted as bicyclo(ortho-BA)-OO•; Fig. 3b), which consists of a peroxyl radical
functionalized by an allylic cyclohexyl moiety with a -CH2OH function at the 4 position, -OH function
at the 5 position, and a peroxide group bridging the 4 and 6 positions (denoted as bicyclo(ortho-BA)-;
Fig. 3b). Steps 1 and 2 (Fig. 3b) shows sequential •OH and O2 addition to benzyl alcohol through the
same reactions shown in Scheme 1 (step 2c) and Scheme 2 (step 3b), respectively. Such sequential

additions yield 5-hydroxymethyl-6-hydroxy-cyclohexa-2,4-dienyl-peroxyl•. This peroxyl• intermediate
reacts further (step 3; Fig. 3b) by intramolecular peroxyl attack at the 5-position of the cyclohexadienyl
function, forming bicyclo(ortho-BA)•. Bicyclo(ortho-BA)• further reacts in step 4 (Fig. 3b) through O2
addition at the allyl group to form bicyclo(ortho-BA)-OO• (Fig. 3b).

Steps 5-11 (Fig. 3b) show the ring opening and fragmentation of bicyclo(ortho-BA)-OO• to
form 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal, glyoxal, and •OOH. Step 5 shows a bimolecular reaction between
bicyclo(ortho-BA)-OO• and another peroxyl radical (ROO•), eliminating O2 and forming two alkoxyl•
products (bicyclo(ortho-BA)-O• (Fig. 3b) and RO•). Such oxygen transfer reactions of secondary
peroxyl radicals (e.g., cyclohexylperoxyl•, cyclopentylperoxyl•, hydroxycyclohexylperoxyl•) occur in
aqueous phase with rapid rate constants of order 107 to 108 M-1 s-154,61. Step 6 shows the ring-opening
of bicyclo(ortho-BA)-O• into an alkoxyl radical functionalized by a 6-oxo-5-hydroxy-4hydroxymethyl-hex-2-enal moiety (denoted as ortho-BA-open•; Fig. 3b). This step involves the
opening of both cyclohexenyl and dioxolanyl rings via concerted C-C and O-O cleavage. In step 7,
ortho-BA-open• undergoes β-cleavage to form 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal and 2-oxo-1-hydroxyl-ethyl•.
2-oxo-1-hydroxyl-ethyl• reacts further by adding O2 to form 2-oxo-1-hydroxyl-ethylperoxyl• (step 8).
The 2-oxo-1-hydroxyl-ethylperoxyl• undergoes •OOH elimination to form glyoxal (step 9). Steps 10
and 12 show the hydration of aldehyde functions in glyoxal and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal products.
Glyoxal exists predominantly in its di-hydrated form (denoted as glyoxal.2H2O) in aqueous
solution62. The equilibrium for the hydration of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal also likely favors the
hydrated form (denoted as 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O), given the presence of butenedial, which
has an analogous unsaturated alkene-al group, is present predominantly as a hydrate63. These
observations motivated us to consider hydrated forms of these aldehydes when investigating their
further oxidation in Section 2.3. However, DFT calculations of these aldehyde hydration reactions show
that, in contrast with experimental reports, the aldehyde form is thermodynamically favored (Table S9).
The bicyclo(ortho-BA)-O• intermediate can also undergo epoxidation by intramolecular O•
attack of the vicinal C=C bond28 (step 7; Fig. 3). The cyclic epoxide formed in step 7 can also fragment,
producing glyoxal and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal epoxide28. The calculated ΔG‡ value for the
bicyclo(ortho-BA)-O• epoxidation reaction (44 kJ mol-1) was 13 kJ mol-1 larger than the ΔG‡ value for
ring opening (Fig. 3); this relatively larger barrier indicates that bicyclo(ortho-BA)-O• epoxidation
occurs negligibly during benzyl alcohol fragmentation. Such relatively slow bicyclo(ortho-BA)-O•
epoxidation in the aqueous phase contrasts reports in the gas-phase where such oxyl• intermediates
undergo epoxidation and ring-opening at comparable rates28.

The addition of O2 to bicyclo(ortho-BA)• is shown in step 4 (Fig. 3b) to occur at the 1 position
of the allyl group, instead of the 3 position. The free energy barrier for O2 addition at the 1 position (54
kJ mol-1) is only slightly lower than O2 addition at the 3 position (55 kJ mol-1), however, suggesting that
bicyclo(ortho-BA)• reacts through both routes competitively. The O2 addition at the 3-position forms a
peroxyl• intermediate that ultimately fragments into 3-hydroxy-2-oxo-propanal and butenedial products
(step 2b; Scheme S1), instead of the glyoxal and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal products formed from
fragmentation of bicyclo(ortho-BA)-OO•. Such competition between O2 additions at different locations
in the allyl group, together with the possible fragmentation of meta- and para-BA/•OH to glyoxal and
2-hydroxymethyl-but-2-enedial (steps 2e and 2f; Scheme S1), suggests that benzyl alcohol
fragmentation would likely form 3-hydroxy-2-oxo-propanal, butenedial, and 2-hydroxymethyl-but-2enedial alongside the glyoxal and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal products formed in Figure 3b.
The reactive nature of free radicals54 suggests that the ortho-BA/•OH fragmentation reactions
(Fig. 3b) occur rapidly at pseudo-steady state. This is supported by comparing the calculated rate
constants for these reactions (Fig. 3b) with the measured rates of benzyl alcohol consumption (1.9×108

M s-1; Table S16), as discussed in Section S6. The pseudo-steady-state nature of the reactions in

Figure 3b indicates that they occur almost instantaneously upon benzyl alcohol activation by •OH
(steps 1; Fig. 3b), making them plausible pathways for benzyl alcohol consumption under the supply
of •OH from ultrasound-induced cavitation processes. Benzyl alcohol fragmentation through this orthoBA/•OH fragmentation route is consistent with the detection of glyoxal, a primary fragmentation
product (Fig. 3b), in the product solution of benzyl alcohol oxidation analyzed with high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The glyoxal yields were not quantified, however, because the signals
from glyoxal overlapped with other features in the HPLC chromatographs.
The fragmentation of benzene in the aqueous phase via the same •OH-initiated process for
ortho-benzyl alcohol fragmentation was examined using DFT methods in Section S4. The changes in
free energies for each elementary step in benzene fragmentation (Table S8) differed by less than 20 kJ
mol-1 from those in ortho-benzyl alcohol fragmentation (Table S9), with free energy barriers differing
by no more than 10 kJ mol-1 in magnitude. These comparable changes in free energy and free energy
barriers suggests that benzene fragmentation is also feasible, and indicates, more broadly, that aqueous

benzene and its substituted derivatives undergo similar fragmentation processes, as observed in the gasphase27–33.

2.3. Superoxide mediates 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal conversion to oxalic acid.
Converting benzyl-alcohol-fragmentation products (i.e., glyoxal.2H2O or 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O) into oxalic acid requires activation by oxidants other than •OH. This is because •OH is
scavenged by nearly diffusion-limited reactions with excess amounts of benzyl alcohol present during
sonochemical reactions (Section 2.1). The •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions that form aromatic products
(Scheme 2) and fragmentation products (Fig. 3b) also form •OOH. •OOH exists in equilibrium with its
conjugate base, •O2– in aqueous solution35,64,65. The nucleophilicity of •O2– suggests it could initiate
oxidation to oxalic acid by attacking the electrophilic α-β unsaturated carbonyl function of 5-hydroxy4-oxo-pentenal.H2O. The activation of glyoxal.2H2O or 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O by •OOH and
peroxyl• intermediates were also considered but were found to occur at rates that were too slow to be
relevant to oxalic acid formation, as discussed in Section S8.
Scheme 4 shows a mechanism proposed to convert 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O into oxalic
acid through a sequence of steps initiated by •O2–. The three remaining C-atoms form two formic acid
molecules and formaldehyde. Steps 1 and 2 show elementary reactions while steps 3, 4, and 5 group
multiple elementary steps together. A comprehensive sequence of elementary steps for these reactions
is shown in Scheme S3 (21 elementary steps in total). This mechanistic proposal is consistent with the
detection of formic acid in the products of benzyl alcohol oxidation analyzed with HPLC. The yields
of formic acid were not quantified, however, because the signals from formic acid overlapped with
other features in the HPLC chromatographs.
Step 1 in Scheme 4 shows conjugate •O2– addition to 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O, with •O2–
added to the β C-atom (relative to the carbonyl). This addition forms a peroxyl radical functionalized
by a pentenolate moiety (1,5,5-trihydroxy-2-oxy-pent-2-en-4-yl), denoted as 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O/•O2– (Scheme 4). Step 2 (Scheme 4) shows proton transfer from H+ to 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O/•O2– at the α-position relative to the peroxyl group. This proton transfer forms a peroxyl•
intermediate functionalized by a 1,5,5-trihydroxy-2-oxo-pentan-4-yl moiety (1,5,5-trihydroxy-2-oxo-

pentan-4-yl-peroxyl•). Such protonation is shown to occur at the carbanion to form the relatively stable
keto tautomer66 in favor of the enol tautomer. The weak acidity of α-carbons in ketones suggests that 5hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– protonates irreversibly (step 2).

Steps 3-5 (Scheme 4) show a series of C-C cleavage reactions that convert 1,5,5-trihydroxy-2oxo-pentan-4-yl-peroxyl• into two formic acid molecules (steps 3 and 4), oxalic acid (steps 5), and
formaldehyde (steps 5). Step 3 converts the 5-carbon peroxyl• intermediate formed in step 2 into 3hydroperoxy-3,4,4-trihydroxybutanal and formic acid as organic products. Step 4 (Scheme 4) converts
the butanal product of Step 3 into 2-hydroperoxy-2,3,3-trihydroxypropyl• and formic acid. This
sequence is initiated by •O2– adding to the aldehyde function of 3-hydroperoxy-3,4,4-trihydroxybutanal
(step 12; Scheme S2). Step 5 (Scheme 4) converts the 2-hydroperoxy-2,3,3-trihydroxypropyl•
intermediate into oxalic acid and formaldehyde. Steps 3 and 5 both yield •OOH which, upon
deprotonation, regenerates the •O2– and H+ reactants involved in Steps 1, 2, and 4. The 5-hydroxy-4oxo-pentenal.H2O oxidation reactions in Scheme 4 consequently propagate the chain of radical
reactions initiated by •OH, without terminating radical intermediates.
DFT-based methods with implicit H2O solvation (described in Sections S2) were used to
calculate the free energies of reaction, free energy barriers, and rate constants for the steps in Scheme
4 and elementary steps that mediate them (Scheme S3; Table S10) at reaction temperature (315 K).
The free energy changes for the steps in Scheme 4 are reported therein. Step 1 (Scheme 4) occurs with
a positive change in free energy (21 kJ mol-1; Scheme 4), indicating that •O2– addition to 5-hydroxy-4oxo-pentenal.H2O to form 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– is disfavored thermodynamically. The
subsequent reactions that oxidize 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– (step 2-5; Scheme 4), in contrast,
occur with negative free energy changes (from -668 to -149 kJ mol-1; Scheme 4), reflecting a
thermodynamic driving force for 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– oxidation once formed in step 1
(Scheme 4).
The reactive nature of free radicals54 suggests that the reactions that mediate 1,5,5-trihydroxy2-oxo-pentan-4-yl-peroxyl• oxidation (steps 3-5; Scheme 4) occur at pseudo-steady state, as was
concluded for the steps that mediate ortho-BA/•OH fragmentation (Section 2.2). The pseudo-steadystate nature of these reactions is supported by comparisons drawn between the calculated rate constants
of elementary steps that comprise these groupings in Scheme 4 (Scheme S3) with the rate constants for
•O2– addition to 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– protonation,

as discussed in Section S11. The pseudo-steady-state nature of these steps suggests that 1,5,5trihydroxy-2-oxo-pentan-4-yl-peroxyl• is oxidized to oxalic acid (steps 3-5; Scheme 4) instantly once
formed from 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– (steps 2; Scheme 4). The rate of 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O/•O2– protonation (step 2; Scheme 4) therefore limits 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O
oxidation to oxalic acid through the steps in Scheme 4.
Oxalic acid forms at yields which increase linearly with time at the initial stages of the
sonochemical benzyl alcohol oxidation process (< 1.1×104 s; Fig. 1). This constant rate of oxalic acid
production indicates that the intermediates in oxalic acid formation are formed and consumed in rapid
succession without accumulating to concentrations comparable to other oxidation products. Oxalic acid
would otherwise form at an increasing rate as the concentrations of these reactive intermediates increase.
Consequently, 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O must be reactive enough even at low concentrations
generated within the initial stages of benzyl alcohol oxidation to plausibly mediate oxalic acid formation
through the steps in Scheme 4.
A kinetic model for 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O formation from benzyl alcohol (Fig. 3b)
and conversion to oxalic acid (Scheme 4) was constructed to simulate 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O
and oxalic acid concentrations during the initial stages of sonochemical benzyl alcohol oxidation. The
irreversible nature of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– protonation (as expected from the weak
acidity of α-carbons in ketones; step 2; Scheme 4) taken together with the pseudo-steady-state oxidation
of its protonated counterpart (1,5,5-trihydroxy-2-oxo-pentan-4-yl-peroxyl•; steps 3-5; Scheme 4) to
oxalic acid (Section S11) suggests that the rate of oxalic acid formation equals the forward rate of 5hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– protonation ( 𝑟!"#→"% ). The rate of this protonation reaction
(𝑟!"#→"% ) is proportional to the concentration of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– ([𝐻𝑂𝑃/• 𝑂&' ])
and of H+ ([𝐻( ]). Proton-transfer occurs between enolates and H+ at rates that are near the limits of
diffusion66, indicating that the rate constant for this 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– protonation
reaction reflects diffusion control (𝑘! ; Eq. S7):
𝑟!"#→"% = 𝑘) [𝐻( ][𝐻𝑂𝑃⁄• 𝑂&' ]

A comparison between the DFT-derived rate constant for •O2– elimination from 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O/•O2– (the reverse of step 1; Scheme 4) and the pseudo-first-order rate constant 5-hydroxy4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– protonation (step 2; Scheme 4), drawn in Section S10, shows that 5-hydroxy4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– forms in quasi-equilibrium with 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O and •O2–.
This quasi-equilibrium concentration of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O/•O2– is related the
concentrations of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O ([𝐻𝑂𝑃]) and •O2– ([• 𝑂&' ]) by an equilibrium constant
for the addition reaction (𝐾!"#,"!" ; step 1; Scheme 4):

The rate of oxalic acid formation (𝑟!"#→"% ) can be related to the concentrations of 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O and •O2– by replacing the [𝐻𝑂𝑃⁄• 𝑂&' ] term in Equation 2 with its value from Equation

(4)

The form of Equation 4 shows that oxalic acid forms at a rate that is proportional to •O2–, H+, and 5hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O concentrations.
Mixtures of •O2– and •OOH (•OOH/•O2–) form as a stoichiometric product of •OH-benzyl
alcohol reactions (Scheme 2 and Fig. 3). The stoichiometric formation of these species, combined with
the conclusion that •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions are predominantly responsible for benzyl alcohol
consumption during ultrasound irradiation (Section 2.1), suggests that the initial forward rate of
•OOH/•O2– formation ( 𝑟•""!/•"!" ) corresponds to the initial rate measured for benzyl alcohol
consumption (1.9×10-8 M-1 s-1; Table S16). •OOH/•O2– terminate through either single-electron transfer
between •O2 and •OOH (Eq. 3) or H-transfer between two •OOH (Eq. 4):

obtained by equating the rate of •OOH/•O2– formation (from •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions) and

reflecting pH effect on equilibrium between •O2– and •OOH.
Time-dependent concentrations of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O ([𝐻𝑂𝑃]), which influence
oxalic acid formation rates through Equation 4, were described by equating the rate of 5-hydroxy-4oxo-pentenal.H2O accumulation (𝑑[𝐻𝑂𝑃]⁄𝑑𝑡) to the difference between its rate of formation by benzyl
alcohol fragmentation (𝑟/%→!"# ) and consumption by oxidation to oxalic acid (𝑟!"#→"% ; Eq. 2):

This set of coupled equations (Eqs. 4, 7, and 8) were solved numerically to calculate time-dependent
concentrations of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O and oxalic acid. [𝐻( ] was calculated by solving the
system of algebraic equations for the deprotonation of acid products (oxalic and formic acid) at
equilibrium (Section S6). Formic acid yields were assumed to be twice the yield of oxalic acid to reflect
the stoichiometry of the proposed 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O fragmentation mechanism (Scheme
4). The 𝑟/%→!"# value was determined by regressing the predicted oxalic acid yields to measured
values in the initial stages of the oxidation process (within 1.1×104 s) when both benzyl alcohol and
oxalic acid concentrations changed linearly with time (Fig. 1). This regression was necessary because
the amount of benzyl alcohol that fragmented specifically to 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O (steps 2c2d; Scheme S1) could not be assessed directly from the distributions of products measured during
sonochemical experiments. An upper bound for the 𝑟/%→!"# value was specified by the rate of benzyl
alcohol consumption that was unaccounted for by yields of products with the aromatic ring intact

(9.0×10-9 M s-1; Table S16). The regressed 𝑟/%→!"# values are shown in Table S17. The concentrations
of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O and oxalic acid are shown in Figures 4a and 4b, respectively,
calculated using different values of 𝐾!"#,•"!" (4.0×10-4 to 4.0 M-1). The lower bound of 𝐾!"#,•"!"
reflects the value calculated using DFT (Table S10). Figure 4b also shows the measured yields of
oxalic acid reported in Figure 1 for comparison.
The 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O concentrations calculated with the smaller 𝐾!"#,•"!"
values (4.0×10-4 to 4.0×10-3 M-1) increased monotonically with reaction time, ultimately exceeding 104

at earlier reaction times and at lower concentrations as 𝐾!"#,•"!" increased. The peak 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O concentration emerges when 𝐾!"#,•"!" values increase because of a concomitant increase
in 𝑟!"#→"% (Eq. 4), which ultimately exceeds 𝑟/%→!"# values (Table S16) as 5-hydroxy-4-oxopentenal.H2O accumulates.
The calculated oxalic acid concentrations increased monotonically with reaction time for all
𝐾!"#,•"!" values considered (Fig. 4b). The oxalic acid concentrations calculated using the DFT value
for 𝐾!"#,•"!" (4.0×10-4 M-1) were negligible compared to the measured yields (Fig. 4b). Oxalic acid
concentrations calculated with the larger 𝐾!"#,•"!" values of 2.0 M-1 and 4.0 M-1, however, were in close
agreement (within 27% and 17%, respectively) with measured yields. The 𝑟/%→!"# values needed for
these predictions (6.7(±2.0)×10-9 M s-1 and 6.4(±1.2)×10-9 M s-1, respectively) were less than the rate of
benzyl alcohol consumption to the non-aromatic products (9.0×10-9 M s-1; Table S16), and are therefore
consistent with the amounts of benzyl alcohol converted by ultrasound irradiation.
The ratios between the 𝐾!"#,•"!" values needed to accurately predict oxalic acid yields (2.0 M1

and 4.0 M-1; Fig. 4) and the DFT-derived 𝐾!"#,•"!" value (4.0×10-4 M-1) correspond to differences in

free energy for the •O2– and 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O reaction (step 1; Scheme 4) of -16 kJ mol1 (𝐾!"#,•"!" =2.0 M-1) and -18 kJ mol-1 (𝐾!"#,•"!" =4.0 M-1). This difference in free energy is reasonable
considering the absolute errors associated with predicting the free energies of ions in solution using the

reactions in solution using implicit solvation models68.

Figure 4: The concentrations of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O (a; dashed curves) and oxalic acid (b;

Different values for the equilibrium constants for the •O2–-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O reaction
(𝐾!"#,•"!" ; step 1; Scheme 3) relative to its DFT-derived value (4.0×10-4 M-1; KDFT; Table S10) were
used and shown in different colors. The measured oxalic acid concentrations from Figure 1 (circles).
The pH was calculated from equilibrated deprotonation of oxalic acid and formic acid products (Section
S7). The 𝑟/%→!"# values in Equation 4 were regressed to the measured oxalic acid concentrations, and
reported in Table S17.

Figure 4b represents an agreement between measured oxalic acid yields and predictions from
the kinetic model. This agreement demonstrates that the proposed fragmentation of benzyl alcohol to
5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O through mechanisms established in gas-phase chemistry (Fig. 3b) and
its subsequent oxidation mediated by •O2– (Scheme 4) together explain how oxalic acid forms during
sonochemical benzyl alcohol oxidation. The pathway involving •O2– addition to the electrophilic

aldehyde, ketone, and unsaturated ketone functions requires a protic solvent (H2O) for •OOH
deprotonation to •O2–. The nucleophilic reactions of •O2– consequently drive significant oxalic acid
production from aqueous •OH-initiated benzyl alcohol oxidation processes in sonochemical reactors,
unlike in the gas-phase where oxalic acid is not observed28,30,45.
5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal.H2O is oxidized by •O2– (Scheme 4) without involving •OH, thereby
preserving the •OH for initiating benzyl alcohol oxidation. These •O2– reactions therefore reduce the
number of •OH initiators needed to oxidize benzyl alcohol and its oxidation products, thus lowering the
operational costs associated with generating •OH. Furthermore, •OOH (and •O2– by inference) has been
reported as an intermediate in •OH-initiated oxidation reactions of aqueous aldehydes39–41 (hydrates),
alcohols41,42, α-β ketals39,40, organic acids41,43, and arenes24,26. This ability for •OOH and •O2– to form in
such diverse •OH-initiated aqueous oxidation reactions suggests that nucleophilic •O2– reactions with
unsaturated ketones, ketones, and aldehydes, shown here in the context of benzyl alcohol oxidation,
may propagate analogous reactions in advanced oxidation processes of water contaminated by diverse
organic pollutants. Designing oxidation processes that harness these •O2– propagation reactions can
therefore help make •OH-based oxidation processes cost-effective and scalable for treating municipal,
industrial, and agricultural wastewaters.

3. Conclusions
Low frequency ultrasound irradiation (20 kHz) is shown to oxidize aqueous benzyl alcohol in
an O2-rich environment through pathways initiated by •OH, forming benzaldehyde, phenol,
hydroxymethyl-phenol isomers, and oxalic acid as the predominant products. Mechanistic inquiries into
•OH-benzyl alcohol reactions and kinetic assessments of elementary steps using density functional
theory indicate that these products result from rapid sequences of radical reactions occurring at pseudosteady state. Aromatic benzyl alcohol substitution is mediated by •OH addition to the aromatic ring at
ipso, ortho, meta, and para positions relative to the hydroxymethyl- function, forming benzyl alcohol•OH adducts. The ipso adduct eliminates hydroxymethyl• yielding phenol, while ortho, meta, and para
adducts transfer H• to O2, forming hydroxymethyl-phenol isomers and •OOH. Through parallel
pathways, these benzyl alcohol-•OH adducts mediate the de-aromatization and fragmentation of benzyl

alcohol to α-carbonyl-aldehyde (i.e., glyoxal or 3-hydroxy-2-oxopropanal) and γ-carbonyl-alk-2-enal
(i.e., but-2-enedial, 2-hydroxymethyl-but-2-enedial, or 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pent-2-enal) products. These
fragmentation pathways follow similar mechanisms to those established for aromatic compounds in the
gas phase.
•O2–, which forms as a byproduct of •OH-benzyl alcohol reactions, is found to activate the
hydrated form of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal by adding to its α-β unsaturated carbonyl function. The
nucleophilic addition initiates radical-chain propagation reactions that sequentially cleave 3 C-C bonds
yielding oxalic acid, formic acid, and formaldehyde, and regenerate •O2–. This sequence is mediated by
nucleophilic additions of •O2– to ketone and aldehyde functions of 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal-derived
intermediates. Kinetic analyses of these 5-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentenal oxidation reactions show that they
provide a feasible route to oxalic acid during sonochemical benzyl alcohol oxidation. These •O2–
reactions require a protic solvent to stabilize the charged •O2– species, and therefore accounts for oxalic
acid formation from benzyl alcohol oxidation in the aqueous phase, unlike in the gas-phase.
The nucleophilic reactions of •O2– uncovered in mechanisms for benzyl alcohol oxidation
reveals •O2– to be a potent initiator for degrading unsaturated carbonyls, ketones, and aldehydes in
aqueous solutions. These •O2– reactions do not consume •OH, thereby degrading carbonyl-containing
molecules while preserving •OH for reaction with refractory molecules. Leveraging such •O2– reactions
offers a promising strategy to reduce the energy and chemical demands of advanced oxidation processes,
thus promoting their sustainable and scalable application in wastewater treatment.
