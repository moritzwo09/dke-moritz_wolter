Abstract
Levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in the United States have declined substantially in
recent decades, yielding substantial benefits for public health. This study evaluates emission reductions
across five key economic sectors—electricity, industrial, transportation, agriculture, and residential—and
their impact on air quality and health. We employ a recently-developed sector-specific inventory that
provides emissions and their spatial disaggregation across time in a self-consistent framework. Using a
national source-receptor matrix, we estimate annual PM2.5-attributable mortality and its variability
spatiotemporally and by sector.
We find that annual PM2.5-attributable mortality decreased 53% between 2002 (142,300 deaths) and 2019
(66,300 deaths). The largest reductions were in secondary PM2.5 from NOₓ, SOₓ, and VOC emissions from
electricity and transportation. Emissions reductions from industrial and residential sectors have been more
modest. In contrast, agricultural emissions, especially NH3, increased over time; the importance of
agriculture among the five sectors increased from second-smallest (2002) to the largest (2019). While the
reductions in PM2.5-attributable mortality have been large (more than a factor of 2), future progress may
need to focus greater attention on agricultural emissions, in addition to traditionally dominant sources
such as transportation and industry.

Introduction
In recent decades, levels of criteria air pollution have declined substantially in the United States (US),
yielding large public health benefits. Between 1990 and 2017, emissions of PM2.5 (i.e., fine particles),
NOx, SOx, and VOCs decreased 29%, 58%, 88% and 40%, respectively [1]. US Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) monitoring stations indicate that annual PM2.5 levels declined 42% during 2000-2017
[1]. These improvements reflect local, regional, and national policy efforts, driven largely by the Clean
Air Act [2-4].
PM2.5-attributable mortality is the largest environmental risk factor in the US [5-7]. In understanding
PM2.5 health impacts and how to reduce those impacts, one would want to know which sources and
economic sectors contribute to attributable impacts and also what are the patterns, especially the temporal
trends, underlying those impacts. Prior research has generally either investigated temporal trends or the
economic sectors contributing to PM2.5-attributable health impacts, but not both. Examples of the former
(i.e., studies of temporal trends) include the following. Zhang et al. (2018) modeled PM2.5 and attributable
mortality for 1990-2010 [8]. Fann et al. (2017) used monitoring data to estimate PM2.5-attributable
mortality for 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 [9]. Cohen et al. (2017) combined air quality model simulations,
satellite data, and ground observations to evaluate temporal trends in PM2.5-attributable disease burden at
five-year intervals from 1990 to 2015 [10].
Examples of the latter (studies of sector-specific impacts) include Caiazzo et al. (2013), who assessed the
impacts of six major economic sectors on PM2.5 and O3 -attributable mortality for year-2005 [11]. Thakrar
et al. (2020) provided a detailed breakdown of PM2.5-attributable mortality for multiple sectors, activities,
and processes for year-2014 [12].
Here, we estimate PM2.5-attributable mortality annually for 2002-2019. We disaggregate the results into
five sectors (transportation, electricity, industry, agricultural, and residential) and as well into activities,
processes, and chemical species, and by US state. These multiple disaggregations, along with temporal
trends, can shed important light on the effectiveness of past air pollution controls and help identify
challenges and opportunities for future policy efforts.

Methods
Emissions of primary PM2.5 and the four secondary precursors of PM2.5 (NOx, SOx, NH3, and VOCs), for
18 years (2002-2019), are from USEPA EQUATES [13,14]. Often, emission-inventories are carried out
for a single year at a time; spatial surrogates often change across inventories, making temporal
comparisons more difficult and less useful (i.e., more challenging to interpret). In contrast, the EQUATES
approach is internally-consistent across time and space, and covers the entire US, making it well-suited
for the research questions investigated here.
In EQUATES, emissions are provided by county or latitude/longitude; we gridded them to the InMAP
domain using spatial surrogates. Annual anthropogenic emissions in EQUATES are characterized into
5,434 Source Classification Codes (SCCs). Following Thakrar et al. (2020), we classify emissions in
multiple ways: into five broad sectors (electricity, industrial, transportation, agriculture, residential), 25
activities, 10 processes, and 5 pollutants [12]. See Supplementary Information (SI) for additional details.

EQUATES includes non-anthropogenic emissions (e.g., wildfires) and transboundary pollution (e.g.,
emissions in other countries), however, those sources are outside the scope of this analysis to maintain
consistency between emissions inputs and model capabilities.
Changes in annual-average PM2.5 concentrations in the contiguous US are modeled using the Intervention
Model for Air Pollution (InMAP), an open-source reduced-complexity model [14]. Specifically, we use
the InMAP source-receptor matrices (ISRM) to estimate changes in annual speciated PM2.5 concentrations
(five species: primary PM2.5, particulate nitrate, particulate ammonium, particulate sulfate, secondary
organic aerosol (SOA)) from each emission source. InMAP and the ISRM have been widely used in the
literature. Reported model performance indicates a population-weighted mean bias of –3.1 µg/m³ and a
mean fractional bias (MFB) of –38% against observations, and R²=0.90, MFB=–17% against
WRF-Chem. (Additional model–measurement comparisons are in the Discussion section).
We use ISRM-estimated PM2.5 concentrations, population data from the US Census, and county-level
baseline mortality rates from the US Centers for Disease Control to calculate attributable mortality
[15,16]. To spatially align emissions with the ISRM variable-resolution grid (ranging from 1 km to 48
km), we spatially allocate EQUATES inventory emissions using USEPA spatial surrogates following
recommended methodology from Spatial Allocator Tool [19]. To ensure temporal consistency, we use
population and mortality data from the same year as the emissions—for example, 2002 emissions are
paired with 2002 Census and mortality data. This step is done for each sector, activity, processes and
pollutants, for each year. We employ the dose response relationships from Nasari et al (2016), Burnett et
al. (2018), and Krewski et al. (2009), as parametrized in Tessum et al. (2017) [7,17,18].

Results
During 2002-2019, EQUATES emissions (primary PM2.5, NOx, SOx, VOCs) declined significantly (Figure
1), with large reductions for SOx (87%) and NOx (66%), modest reductions for VOC (28%) and primary
PM2.5 (14%), and an increase in NH3 emissions (20%). (Figure 1 uses Imperial units: 1 ton = 10-6 Mt =
2,000 pounds.)

Annual attributable mortality decreased 53%, from 142,300 (in 2002) to 66,300 (2019), reflecting
sector-specific reductions in attributable mortality from electricity (88% reduction, 2002-2019), industrial
(47%), transportation (63%), and residential (41%), and increases for agriculture (23%) (Figure 3).
Two noticeable sectoral changes in Figure 3 are in the electricity sector, from relatively important (2002)
to the lowest-impact sector (2019), and in agriculture, from relatively less important (2002) to the
largest-impact sector (2019). Agriculture’s increase was modest (23%), but is in contrast to large
reductions in the remaining sectors (in aggregate, 65%).

Figure 3. Annual attributable mortality by sector.

National trends in PM2.5 pollution levels and attributable mortality reflect locally-varying combinations of
policies, emissions, population density and land use, and other factors. The largest economic sector
contributing to attributable mortality by state has shifted over time (Figure 4, upper plots), from usually
transportation and electricity (2002) to usually agriculture and industry (2019). As mentioned above, and
following Thakrar et al. (2020), we also disaggregated attributable mortality by activity, process, and
pollutant [12]. Results (Figure 4, lower plots) document the dramatic reshuffling of importance of specific
activities and processes. In 2002, leading activities and processes include coal-electricity, diesel-trucks,
and gasoline- passenger vehicles. In 2019, the relative importance of livestock and fertilizer use have
increased, and coal-electricity has decreased. SOx shifted from most-important species (2002) to
least-important (2019). See SI for additional details.

plots). Annual attributable mortality, by sector, activity, process, and pollutant emitted for years 2002 and 2019 (lower plots). The
number of deaths for each category is provided in parentheses. Flows are color-coded by sector: electricity (green), industrial
(purple), transportation (blue), agriculture (pink), and residential (red). Within each column, flows are ordered from largest (top)
to smallest (bottom) deaths per year. Activities and processes responsible for more than 3,000 annual deaths are labeled.

The timing of emission-reduction matters; enacting emission reductions sooner or faster will result in
greater total benefits to health than delaying the same reductions. To uncover this aspect, one can consider
attributable mortality in cumulative, rather than annual, terms. Over the 18-year study period, in
aggregate, approximately 1.8 million deaths in the US were attributed to PM2.5 air pollution. If the
observed emission-reductions had not happened (i.e., if emissions post-2002 were fixed at 2002 levels),
we estimate that an additional 0.7 million attributable deaths (i.e., a 39% increase) would have occurred
(Figure 5). Those avoided deaths reflect the public health improvements attributable to emission
reductions during 2002-2019. Cumulatively during 2002-2019, transportation and industry were
responsible for the highest number of deaths, followed by electricity; in recent years, contributions from
these sectors have plateaued, while those from agriculture have continued to rise.
Of the 0.7 million avoided deaths, the electricity, transportation, and industrial sectors contributed the
most. The cumulative (2002-2019) avoided mortality for agriculture is negative 9700 deaths (i.e.,
reflecting that agriculture emissions are increasing, counteracting the progress made in other sectors).

difference between actual-emissions (i.e., the left plot) and if, counterfactually, emissions during 2002-2019 has stayed constant

Discussion
We investigated PM2.5 levels and attributable mortality by state, for 2002 to 2019 (annually), for each
sector, activity, process, and chemical pollutant. PM2.5 attributable mortality declined substantially (53%),
from 142,300 deaths (in 2002) to 66,300 (2019).
These emission reductions occurred across nearly all major sources, including an 89% (37,300 fewer
deaths/y) reduction in annual mortality attributable to coal-fired electricity, a 68% (16,300) reduction
from diesel-powered transportation, and 69% (15,100) for gasoline-transportation. Annual attributable
mortality for agriculture increased 23% (4,300 more deaths/y), including attributable mortality increases
of 20% (1800) for livestock, 57% (2,300) for fertilizer use, and 54% (1,300) for commercial cooking. In
aggregate during 2002-2019 (i.e., cumulative rather than annual), PM2.5 pollution resulted in an estimated
1.8 million deaths; we estimate that that number would be 0.7 million deaths larger if emission-reductions
had not happened (i.e., if emissions during 2002-2019 were constant at 2002 levels).
Additional examples of activities/processes with increasing rates for attributable mortality include garden
equipment use (35%), burning industrial waste disposal (23%), fugitive dust from road use (22%) and
tilling (11%); see SI (“Dataset”) for complete list. This list can potentially be useful for framing
emission-reduction efforts, including activities/sectors for which past emission-reduction efforts have
been successful (or not) and for which future efforts should potentially focus additional attention.
Despite overall progress, annual air pollution-related mortality remains high at 66,300 deaths in 2019,
reinforcing the fact that air pollution remains the leading environmental health risk in the United States.
These findings underscore the need for continued targeted regulatory interventions to address PM2.5 air
pollution; this need includes agricultural emissions, which remain largely unregulated compared to other
major pollution sources.

The overall reduction in attributable mortality (i.e., the 53% decline mentioned above) is primarily driven
by decreases in average exposure, owing to emission reductions; indeed, the (emission-driven) changes in
concentration, taken alone, account for a 50% drop in attributable mortality (i.e., nearly equal to the 53%
decline in mortality). Over the same period, improvements in baseline mortality rates contributed an
additional 25% reduction (i.e., baseline mortality [annual deaths per 100,000 people] was 845 in 2002,
and 715 in 2019, a 15% decrease; this matters because PM2.5-attributable mortality is calculated as a
relative risk, i.e., a relative increase in the baseline mortality) [20,21]. However, population growth (288
million (2002), 328 million (2019), a 14% increase) led to a 22% increase in total attributable mortality
[22,23]. (Here, attributable mortality nationally does not scale precisely linearly with national population
because many variables, including population, baseline mortality, and concentration, vary in space and
may be spatially correlated.) Thus, the attributable mortality decrease from improved health outcomes
nearly offset the increase from population growth. (If we instead consider annual PM2.5-attributable
mortality per 100,000 people, that rate decreased 59%, from 49 in 2002 to 20 in 2019.)
Our findings align with previous research on long-term air pollution-related mortality trends, which
documented a decline in air pollution-related mortality over time in the United States [8-10]. Additionally,
our results are consistent with studies examining sectoral contributions to air pollution [11,12], which
identified the electricity and transportation sectors as the dominant contributors in 2005, and the industrial
sector as the leading source in 2014. Lastly, the concentration declines predicted here are strongly
consistent with measurements at USEPA monitoring stations. Specifically, we compared our results
against measured annual-average PM2.5 levels at USEPA monitoring stations that had data across the
relevant years (2002 - 2019). The two trends (i.e., modeled, measured; 2002–2019) show remarkable
similarity in temporal patterns (Figure S1), with a model-measurement correlation of 0.97 (Figure S2) and
both indicating a ~5 µg/m³ reduction in population-weighted PM2.5 concentration during 2002-2019.
Our study expands upon these findings by integrating both mortality trends and sectoral contributions,
providing a comprehensive, time-evolving analysis of air pollution sources. Our 18-year sector-specific
analysis reveals the emerging dominance of agricultural emissions and the declining role of electricity
generation in air pollution-related mortality. As shown above and in Figures S3 and S4, patterns differ by
US state. These insights highlight the shifting burden of air pollution across sectors, reinforcing the need
for adaptive regulatory strategies at local, state, and national levels to address evolving sources of
emissions.

Supplementary Information
The emissions groups used in this paper follow those used in the EPA NEI source categories, but with simplified
aggregations that are more relevant for the analysis. All years in the EQUATES dataset were used, except that for
year-2010 transportation NOx emissions, owing to anomalies in the EQUATES data, we linearly interpolated
those emissions between the year-2009 and -2011 emissions.
Below are definitions of some of the emissions groups as used here to clarify their scope and meaning by Thakrar
et al. (2020) [12].
Sector. Broad aggregations of polluting activities largely following EPA NEI source categories.
Industrial & commercial. This sector largely overlaps with the EPA NEI industrial and commercial source
categories, except for industrial and commercial sources that are within the scope of the other sectors, such
as commercial cooking, which is included in the food & agriculture sector instead.
Transportation. This sector largely overlaps with the EPA NEI transportation source category, except for
transportation sources that are within the scope of the other sectors, such as off-road agricultural machinery
use, which is included in the food & agriculture sector instead.
Food & agriculture. This sector includes emissions that take place on farms and in agricultural operations,
and is extended to include emissions from commercial food processing and cooking.
Activity. A human-caused action that directly results in pollution.
Crop burning. Crop burning is solely an agricultural activity. Land management for reducing wildfire risk,
or burning logging residue, is not included within this sector nor within the scope of human- caused
emissions.
Road use. Driving on roads causes emissions primarily by disturbing dust particles present on road
surfaces, but also includes generating small particles from brake and tire wear. This activity also includes
minor contributions from oil spills.
Commercial cooking & food processing. This activity includes food processing for retail as well as restaurant
emissions.
Oil, gas & petroleum production. This activity largely overlaps with the EPA NEI source categories for
the petroleum industry and the oil and gas industry. Emissions include flares and volatilization of
products stored in tanks.
Solvent use. This includes only the use of solvents, such as applying paints or printer inks, and not the
production or storage of solvents.
Waste disposal. This activity includes emissions from site remediation, and burning waste for the purpose
of disposal. Waste combustion for use as a fuel is not included within the scope of this activity.
Materials production. This activity includes the production of any material used in goods production, such
as glass, paper, and ceramic. Emissions from mining and smelting, for example, are often included in this
activity.
Municipal vehicle use. This activity includes use of public buses and road cleaning vehicles.
Process. The means by which the pollution is generated, for any given activity.
Fuel combustion. Burning fuel for the purpose of energy use (e.g., heat or mechanical work).
Burning. This includes burning not for the purpose of energy use. Examples include waste burning, cropland
residue burning, and residential and vehicle fires.

Losses & leaks. Losses & leaks are the inadvertent loss to the atmosphere of a product that is in gaseous or
aerosol form, and typically valuable, but are not dust emissions. NH3 volatilization and NMVOC
evaporation are the main constituents of this group.

Figure S1. Trend in population-weighted annual-average concentrations of PM2.5 , 2002-2019, from EPA monitors and InMAP
estimates. Estimates from EPA monitors are based on data from the n=72 monitoring stations with measurements reported for all
18 years of the study period.

Figure S2. Comparison of population-weighted annual-average PM2.5 concentrations from 2002 to 2019 between EPA monitors
and ISRM (InMAP) estimates. InMAP estimates are consistently lower than EPA observations, likely due to the exclusion of
non-anthropogenic emissions (e.g., wildfires, windblown dust) and transboundary pollution (e.g., emissions from other
countries). Data in this figure are the same data as in Figure S3; each plotted point is one year in Figure S3. For more details on
InMAP performance and limitations, see Tessum et al. (2017) [14].

Figure S4. Trend in total PM2.5-attributable mortality by sector across the 48 contiguous U.S. states. This figure is similar to
Figure S3, but with state-specific y-axis scaling to magnify and illustrate trends in states with lower mortality levels.
