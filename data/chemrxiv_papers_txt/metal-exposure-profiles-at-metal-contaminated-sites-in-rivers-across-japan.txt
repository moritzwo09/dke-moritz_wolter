ABSTRACT

19

Understanding realistic exposure profiles of mixtures is crucial for effectively

20

predicting the ecological risks and effects of metal mixtures in natural environments on a

21

large scale (e.g., at a country level). In this study, we aimed to compile available

22

measurement data for metals relevant to ecological risk assessment in rivers across Japan,

23

identify metals of particular concern based on their relative ecological risks, and derive

24

realistic exposure profiles of these metals based on the compiled data. We focused on six

25

metals of concern (Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Al) selected by comparing available

26

measurement data and 10% inhibition concentrations for the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia.

27

We then compiled measurement data on these metal concentrations, ensuring sufficiently

28

low detection/quantification limits relevant to ecological risk assessments, from a total of

29

531 riverine sites. At 194 metal-contaminated sites, concentrations generally increased in

30

the following order: Cd (median: 0.013 μg/L), Pb (0.072 μg/L) < Ni (0.45 μg/L) < Cu

31

(1.2 μg/L) < Zn (9.1 μg/L), Al (22 μg/L). Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we classified

32

the metal-contaminated sites into three groups (Group 1: 56 sites; Group 2: 104 sites; and

33

Group 3: 34 sites). Group 1 and Group 3 were characterized by higher concentrations of

34

Cd and Ni, respectively, compared to Group 2. Further compilation and accumulation of

35

measurement data, particularly in small rivers (e.g., tributaries of major rivers), are

36

required to more accurately assess contamination levels and ecological risks from metals

37

in rivers nationwide.

INTRODUCTION

39

In aquatic environments such as streams and rivers, contamination by trace metals

40

such as copper and zinc is a long-standing environmental issue (Luoma & Rainbow, 2008;

41

Namba et al., 2020). The risk assessment approaches for many individual metals, such as

42

copper, zinc, and nickel, have seen considerable advancements, particularly with the

43

development of biotic ligand models (Adams et al., 2020). However, predicting

44

ecological impacts of metal mixtures remains a challenging task (Farley et al., 2015),

45

although a general risk assessment framework has been proposed to address this issue

46

(Nys et al., 2018). To effectively understand and predict ecological risks and effects of

47

metal mixtures in natural environments on a broad scale (e.g., a country level), it is crucial

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tdzt3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-8113 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

48

to understand the mixture exposure profiles that are likely to occur (Mebane et al., 2017).

49

In Japan, there has been no comprehensive attempt to compile exposure data or

50

evaluate exposure profiles for multiple elements, including metals, on a nationwide scale.

51

There are two national-level databases that compile results of water quality monitoring in

52

aquatic environments throughout Japan: the Comprehensive Information Website for

53

Water Environment managed by the Ministry of the Environment (https://

54

waterpub.env.go.jp/water-pub/mizu-site/) and the Water Information System managed by

55

the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (http://www1.river.go.jp/).

56

However, the reported quantification limits for metals in these databases are not

57

sufficiently low to be used for ecological risk assessments, and measurements at a

58

majority of monitoring sites have either not been performed or fall below the reported

59

limits. For instance, the reported quantification limits for Cu, Cd, and Pb are generally

60

higher than 10, 0.3, and 1 μg/L, respectively, which are close to or approximately an order

61

of magnitude higher than the U.S. EPA hardness-adjusted water quality criteria for aquatic

62

life (e.g., 2.3, 0.21, 0.42 μg/L at water hardness of 30 mg/L; U. S. Environmental

63

Protection Agency (2016); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2002)).

64

The objectives of this study were thus threefold: (1) to compile available measurement

65

data of metals relevant to ecological risk assessment in rivers across Japan, (2) to identify

66

metals of particular concern based on their relative ecological risks, and (3) to elucidate

67

the realistic exposure profiles of these metals based on the compiled data. The outcomes

68

of this study were expected to provide valuable insights into realistic concentration levels

69

and ratios, which are critical for assessing the ecological risks and effects of exposure to

70

mixtures of metals in Japanese rivers.

SELECTION OF METALS OF CONCERN

73

We first selected metals of concern by comparing measurement data for as many

74

metals as possible in rivers across Japan with toxicity test results performed under the

75

same conditions. As the measurement dataset, we used results of dissolved metal

76

concentrations surveyed at 450 sampling sites across 45 major rivers (i.e., 10 sites per

77

river) in Japan during 2002–2006 (Uchida et al., 2007). For the toxicity test data, we used

78

the IC10 (10% Inhibition Concentration) values for 50 metals, determined by chronic

79

toxicity tests with Ceriodaphnia dubia (Okamoto et al., 2021). The toxicity tests were

80

consistently conducted using filtered and sterilized tap water with a water hardness of

81

approximately 70–80 mg/L. Although water quality parameters important for considering

82

metal bioavailability (e.g., pH, water hardness, and dissolved organic matter; Adams et

83

al., 2020) can vary among sampling sites and differ between the toxicity tests and

84

sampling sites, the results of Okamoto et al. (2021) are considered ideal for the

85

preliminary screening of metals of particular concern.

86

For the 15 metals for which data were available from both sources (Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb,

87

Cd, Al, Mn, Fe, Co, Rb, Sr, Ba, Ti, V, and Cr), we calculated the ratio of the dissolved

88

concentration of each metal to the corresponding IC10 (hereafter, toxic unit, TU) as well

89

as the sum of the TUs at each sampling site. By calculating the contributions of each metal

90

to the sum of the TUs at each sampling site and ranking the metals based on the 95th

91

percentiles of these contributions, the metals in descending order were Ni (0.94), Zn

92

(0.64), Cd (0.61), Al (0.31), and Cu (0.14) at sites where the sum of the TUs ≥ 1 (i.e.,

93

metal-contaminated sites) (Fig. 1). The 95th percentiles of the contributions for Cu, Fe,

94

and Co were similar (0.14, 0.13, and 0.09, respectively). Among these three metals, Cu

95

was included in the following analysis because its IC10 of 12 μg/L (Okamoto et al., 2021)

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tdzt3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-8113 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

96

was somewhat higher than the U.S. EPA hardness-adjusted water quality criterion (e.g.,

97

6.6 μg/L at a water hardness of 70 mg/L) and because ecological risks associated with Cu

98

have been a concern in Japan (Han et al., 2016). Lead was included in the following

99

analysis because the IC10 for Pb reported by Okamoto et al. (2021) was 67 μg/L, which

100

is more than an order of magnitude higher than the U.S. EPA hardness-adjusted water

101

quality criterion of 1.7 μg/L at a water hardness of 70 mg/L. It should be noted that the

102

IC10 of 0.37 μg/L for Ni is two orders of magnitude lower than the U.S. EPA water quality

103

criterion of 38 μg/L at a water hardness of 70 mg/L. Alghouth the direct use of IC10

104

values requires some caution, IC10 values are likely acceptable for screening metals of

105

ecological concern. The following data collection and analysis were conducted for a total

106

of six metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Al).

107

DATA COMPILATION

108

In order to compile as much available monitoring data as possible for these metals in

109

rivers across Japan, we reviewed the Comprehensive Information Website for Water

110

Environment and the Water Information System as well as existing literature covering

111

over 1000 sampling sites in total (excluding the two databases). The literature included

112

peer reviewed papers (e.g., Han et al., 2013) and Japanese project reports. Based on

113

examination

114

concentrations) of all six metals were relatively low, we selected three datasets: the large-

115

scale measurement data of (Uchida et al., 2007); measurements from metal-contaminated

116

rivers affected by legacy mines as well as nearby reference rivers (Iwasaki et al., 2023:

117

26 sites; and Iwasaki et al. unpublished data: 12 sites); and measurements from rivers to

118

assess the ecological impacts of Ni (Takeshita et al., 2019: 50 sites). All these studies

119

reported dissolved metal concentrations by filtering water samples through filters with a

pore size of 0.45 μm and analyzing them using inductively coupled plasma mass

121

spectrometers (ICP-MS) or inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometers

122

(ICP-OES). We analyzed data from a total of 531 sampling sites (excluding 7 estuarine

123

sites from Uchida et al. 2007; see Figure 2a). All the complied data are available in the

124

Supporting information (Table S1).

125

METAL EXPOSURE PROFILES

126

To obtain realistic metal exposure profiles at the metal-contaminated sites where

127

ecological risks due to the five metals were of concern, we first calculated the sum of TUs

128

by dividing the measured dissolved metal concentrations by the U.S. EPA hardness-

129

adjusted water quality criteria for aquatic life (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency,

130

2016; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2002). The water quality criteria for a water

131

hardness of 20 mg/L were used as conservative “safe” concentrations (Cu: 2.3 μg/L, Zn:

132

30.2 μg/L, Pb: 0.42 μg/L, Cd: 0.21 μg/L, Ni: 13.3 μg/L, and Al: 220 μg/L) because water

133

hardness at many of the sampling sites were as low as 20 mg/L (Table S1). We used U.S.

134

EPA water quality criteria because water quality standards for aquatic life are available in

135

Japan for only total Zn (30 μg/L). Any concentration below the quantification or detection

136

limit was operationally replaced with half the corresponding limit for operational

137

purposes (see Table S1 for specific values). We then selected 194 sites where the sum of

138

TUs ≥ 1 as metal-contaminated sites (Figure 2b). In this study, a sum of TUs >1 was used

139

as the conservative criterion for selection, not to accurately assess risk, but rather to select

140

sites where ecological risks could be of concern. Together with a line of empirical

141

evidence that the exceedance of the sum of TUs beyond 1 does not necessarily lead to

142

population or community-level effects on aquatic organisms, such as fish and

143

macroinvertebrates (Iwasaki et al., 2023; Namba et al., 2021), it is important to note that

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tdzt3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-8113 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

144

such impacts may not always be observed at the selected metal-contaminated sites.

145

Based on concentrations of the six metals, the metal-contaminated sites were

146

classified using hierarchical cluster analysis with Ward's method based on Euclidean

147

distances (Ward, 1963). To ensure classification based on metal concentration ratios (i.e.,

148

concentration compositions) rather than absolute concentration values at individual sites,

149

standardized values of log-transformed concentrations were used for the hierarchical

150

cluster analysis.

151

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

152

Based on the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis (see Fig. S1 for the

153

dendrogram), we classified the metal-contaminated sites into three groups (Group 1, 56

154

sites; Group 2, 104 sites; and Group 3, 34 sites). Although there is no absolute criterion

155

for determining the number of clusters in hierarchical cluster analysis, using more than

156

four groups resulted in clusters with fewer than 20 sites. We therefore used a three-group

157

classification.

158

Despite the observed large variations in concentrations of metals, the levels of

159

concentrations at the 194 metal-contaminated sites generally increased in the order: Cd

160

(median: 0.013 μg/L)  Pb (0.072 μg/L) < Ni (0.45 μg/L) < Cu (1.2 μg/L) < Zn (9.1 μg/L)

161

 Al (22 μg/L) (Fig. 3). Compared with Group 2, where the overall metal concentration

162

levels were similar to those at all metal-contaminated sites, the Cd concentrations in

163

Group 1 were notably higher (median: 0.12 μg/L in Group 1 vs. 0.007 μg/L in Group 2).

164

Similarly, the Ni concentrations in Group 3 were relatively high (median: 17 μg/L in

165

Group 3 vs. 0.44 μg/L in Group 2). Each of Groups 1–3 included sampling sites from at

166

least two of three different original datasets (Fig. 2, Table S1), and it was difficult to

167

further interpret the geographic distribution shown in Fig. 1b. However, sampling sites

168

from legacy mine surveys (Iwasaki et al., 2023) were more frequently included in Group

169

1, whereas those from the nickel survey (Takeshita et al., 2019) were more frequently

170

included in Group 3.

171

CONCLUSIONS

172

By compiling measurement data on metal concentrations relevant to ecological risk

173

assessments, we were able to derive realistic compositions and concentration levels of six

174

metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Al) at metal-contaminated sites in rivers across Japan (see

175

Table S2 for the percentiles of metal concentrations in individual groups). This

176

information would be useful in choosing levels of metal concentrations relevant to those

177

found in Japanese rivers for metal mixture toxicity tests, enabling a better assessment of

178

their actual ecological risks. However, it should be noted that the two field studies

179

included in our dataset focused on the impacts of specific metals such as Ni (Takeshita et

180

al., 2019) or Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb (Iwasaki et al., 2023). In addition, Uchida et al. (2007)

181

have measured metal concentrations in the mainstreams of major rivers across Japan but

182

did not make measurements in tributary streams. Because levels of contamination in small

183

streams and rivers are more likely to be high because of their limited capacity for dilution

184

(Büttner et al., 2022; Iwasaki et al., 2022), further compilation and accumulation of

185

measurement data are therefore required to more accurately assess contamination levels

186

and ecological risks from metals in rivers across Japan. To this end, it is essential to

187

encourage the open accessibility of measurement data, along with their geographical

188

coordinates, in easy-to-use formats in publications such as peer-reviewed papers,

189

particularly those written in Japanese. Furthermore, the bioavailability of metals was not

190

considered when selecting the metal-contaminated sites in this study. While important

191

water quality variables such as Ca, Mg, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tdzt3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-8113 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

192

collected as complementary data (Table S1), DOC was not measured by Uchida et al.

193

(2007). Because the influence of DOC on bioavailability can be significant for some

194

metals (OECD, 2017), compiling measurement data on such water quality variables in

195

addition to metals, as well as developing predictive models when measurements are

196

unavailable, will be essential for more accurate metal risk assessments.

Fig. 1. Distribution of the contribution of each metal to the sum of toxic units. The

280

central line in each boxplot represents the median (50th percentile), while

281

the lower and upper boundaries of the box correspond to the 25th (Q1) and

282

75th percentiles (Q3), respectively. The whiskers extend to the smallest and

283

largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the lower

284

and upper quartiles. Red diamonds indicate the 95th percentiles for

285

individual metals. Gray dots represent raw data points.
