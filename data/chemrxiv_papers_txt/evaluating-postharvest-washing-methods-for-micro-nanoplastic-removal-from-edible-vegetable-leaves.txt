Abstract

25

Micro and nano-plastics (MNPs) have become a significant contamination concern in various

26

ecosystems. In agriculture, they contaminate edible plants through different sources, such as

27

irrigation and air deposition, threatening food safety and human health. It is uncertain whether

28

post-harvest cleaning methods can effectively remove MNPs from the surface of edible plants.

29

This study used confocal Raman spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)

30

to assess the efficacy of household and industrial postharvest washing methods in removing MNPs

31

from vegetable leaf surfaces. In particular, the cleaning techniques included tap water washing,

32

vegetable detergent washing, and sonication cleaning. The plastic particles tested included 42 µm

33

polystyrene (PS), 6 µm polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and 61 nm PS. In evaluating cleaning

34

methods to remove MNPs from basil leaves, the tap water washing method demonstrated high

35

removal efficacy for 42 µm PS (93.1%) but lower efficacy for 6 µm PMMA (51.6%). Vegetable

36

detergent was the most effective method for PMMA removal (73.3%). The sonication method

37

exhibited the highest removal efficacy of 59.8% among the three washing methods for removing

38

61 nm PS. This is the first time that the efficacies of common washing methods to remove MNPs

39

from fresh produce were evaluated and compared using confocal Raman spectroscopy and SERS.

40

The research offers critical insights and approaches for assessing the removal efficacy of

41

commonly used washing techniques in decontaminating MNPs from fresh produce. The findings

42

highlight the need to develop more effective washing methods to enhance MNPs removal in the

43

future.

1. Introduction

61

Plastics have found wide applications in various aspects of our lives.1,2 Because of the high

62

utilization of plastics and its low recycling rates,3 plastic contamination impacts a wide range of

63

ecosystems, such as agricultural4 and aquatic environments.5 Larger plastic debris in the

64

environment will undergo degradation, breaking down into smaller fragments,6 due to various

65

environmental factors, such as UV radiation,7 mechanical abrasion,8 and chemical weathering.9

66

The smaller pieces may be invisible to the naked eye, accumulating without being noticed. The

67

presence of plastic debris, often classified as microplastics (MPs, measuring 1 µm-5 mm) and

68

nanoplastics (NPs, measuring less than 1 µm),10 has led to adverse impacts on both human health

69

and the environment.11 Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) can easily contaminate and

70

transport in freshwater ecosystems (e.g.streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, and dams)12 through wind

71

transport,13 atmospheric depositions,14 and surface runoff from nearby lands.15 MNPs enter

72

agricultural lands through multiple pathways, such as plastic mulch application,16 sewage sludge,17

73

and irrigation.18 Those processes were reported to result in annual input of 63,000–430,000 tons

74

of MNPs in European farmlands per year, 44,000-300,000 tons in North American agricultural

75

landscapes, and 2,800-19,000 tons in Australian agricultural lands.19

76

There are concerns about the contamination of crops by MNPs-containing irrigation water, causing

77

food safety and potential health risks. Research conducted in Taiwan examined irrigation water

78

collected around the world and found the presence of MPs in all water samples.20 Another recent

79

study conducted in Italy investigated the quantity of MPs present in vegetables purchased from

80

local markets. The highest concentration of MPs was detected ranging from 72,175 to 130,500

81

particles/gram in sampled vegetables.21 Edible plants like crops can be exposed to MNPs from

82

irrigation water through foliar contact. Recent studies have revealed that foliar MNP exposure

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

83

harmed plant growth and health, as MNPs adhered to plant leaves, they accumulated and

84

underwent translocation within the plants.22–24 Therefore, it is crucial to control or eliminate crop

85

contamination by MNPs and reduce human exposure and risk. Several household postharvest

86

washing methods are commonly used to remove soil, dirt, and environmental pollutants from

87

vegetable leaves,25 such as rinsing with tap water and soaking in food detergent. Besides household

88

washing methods, industrial postharvest washing techniques for cleaning vegetables may also be

89

applied to ensure the cleanness and quality of vegetables before packaging.26 Sonication is one of

90

the most common industrial washing methods to eliminate large visible contaminants.27,28 While

91

these methods can remove certain contaminants and pathogens,25–28 their ability to clean MNPs

92

off vegetable leaves remains unknown.

93

To the best of our knowledge, there has been limited investigation evaluating the efficacy of

94

postharvest washing methods to remove MNPs from leafy vegetable surfaces. Failure to address

95

this question will jeopardize food safety, as foliar MNP contamination on edible plants can

96

adversely affect human health. Recent studies have proven MNPs as a potential contributing factor

97

to autism spectrum disorder, as well as a potential trigger for myocardial infarction, stroke, and

98

even death among patients with detected MNPs in carotid artery plaque.29,30 However, owing to

99

the extremely small size of NPs, there is a shortage of reliable approaches to detect NPs. Direct

100

detection of NPs in/on biological matrices without any labeling is difficult, even with the assistance

101

of an optical microscope. Electron microscope-based techniques, such as Transmission Electron

102

Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-

103

ray Spectroscopy (EDX), are frequently used for NP characterization. Nevertheless, the sample

104

preparation and analysis are time-consuming and expertise-demanding.31 Confocal laser scanning

105

microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) have been used to detect and monitor

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

106

fluorescent dye-labeled NPs (FNPs) within biological structures.32,33 However, they rely on the

107

use of fluorescent dyes, and the results are flawed by multiple artifacts and weaknesses: 1) false

108

positive results and potential toxicity to the tested organisms due to the leakage of fluorescent dyes

109

from the NPs;34–36 2) low signal stability induced by photobleaching;37 3) analytical interference

110

by biological autofluorescence.32,38

111

To address the above knowledge gaps and technical challenges, the objective of this study is to

112

use confocal Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the efficacy of different postharvest washing

113

methods to remove MNPs from vegetable leaves. We examined two common types of plastic

114

particles found in the environment.39 Specifically, we chose polystyrene (PS) particles with sizes

115

of 42 µm and 61 nm, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particles with a size of 6 µm. We

116

selected three washing methods for our study: rinsing with tap water, soaking in vegetable

117

detergent followed by rinsing with tap water, and sonication. These methods were chosen because

118

they are commonly used in household or industrial settings for washing vegetables. To assess the

119

efficacy of these methods in removing MNPs from vegetable leaves, we used confocal Raman

120

spectroscopy imaging to detect the MNPs on leaves before and after washing. To tackle the

121

challenge of detecting NP in biological samples, we developed a novel NP model that allows in-

122

situ assessment of NP removal by confocal surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

123

Evaluating existing postharvest washing methods will help us predict MNP residues on fresh

124

produce and potential human ingestion. Further, the results will guide the development of new

125

practices and strategies to reduce MNP exposure. Our research findings have the potential to

126

improve consumer awareness and industry regulation of MNP contaminations, contributing to a

127

cleaner, safer, and more sustainable food chain.

2. Materials and methods

129

2.1 Materials

130

Sodium citrate dihydrate and ascorbic acid were purchased from Fisher Chemical. Gold acid

131

chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) with a purity of ≥99.9% trace metals basis was obtained from

132

Sigma Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was purchased from Fisher Chemical, while sodium

133

hydroxide (NaOH) was acquired from Sigma Aldrich. 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) was

134

obtained with a purity of 90% from Sigma Aldrich. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with an average

135

molecular weight of 10,000 was sourced from Sigma Aldrich. Divinylbenzene (DVB) with a purity

136

of 80% was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Styrene (ST), which contains 4-tert-butylcatechol as

137

a stabilizer and has a purity of ≥99.9% was sourced from Sigma Aldrich. Additionally, 1.7 wt.%

138

2-methyl-propionamidine dihydrochloride (AIBA) with a purity of 97% was obtained from Sigma

139

Aldrich.

140

2.2 Preparation of MNPs

141

PS and PMMA spherical MPs were purchased from Polyscience Inc., with an average diameter of

142

42 µm and 6 µm, respectively. The model NP exhibits a core-shell structure, wherein the 4-MBA-

143

labeled gold core serves as the SERS nanotag, and the PS shell simulates the plastic surface. To

144

synthesize the gold nanoparticles (nAu), citrate-stabilized gold seeds were first prepared by adding

145

1.0 mL of 1.0 wt.% sodium citrate to 100 mL of boiling 0.001 wt.% HAuCl4·3H2O with stirring

146

and refluxing. The mixture was maintained at a boil for 30 minutes and then allowed to cool down

147

to room temperature; this was used as the citrate-stabilized gold seed suspension. Subsequently,

148

100 µL of the citrate-stabilized gold seed suspension was added to 10 mL of 1 mM HCl and 50

149

µL of 50 mM HAuCl4·3H2O solution under stirring at 700 rpm. To this mixture, 50 µL of freshly

150

prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid was added while stirring at the same speed for 30 seconds. The

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

151

suspension was then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4500 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded

152

while retaining the precipitate. This process was repeated for 4 more times and the nAu were

153

combined and resuspended to a final volume of 5 mL in ultrapure water; nAu were stored in a

154

refrigerator (4 ℃) for further use.

155

To enable SERS imaging, the nAu surface was labeled with a Raman indicator, 4-MBA. This

156

indicator was chosen because of its sharp, characteristic SERS peaks, as well as covalent bonding

157

with nAu through the Au-S bond that prevents leakage of 4-MBA. To label the nAu core, 7 µL of

158

100 mM NaOH was added to a 3.5 mL nAu suspension synthesized above and incubated for 10

159

minutes to prevent aggregation. Subsequently, 35 µL of 10 mM 4-MBA in ethanol was added to

160

the nAu suspension and incubated for 10 minutes. The 4-MBA-labeled nAu were then subjected

161

to centrifugation for 30 minutes at 4500 rpm to eliminate excess 4-MBA molecules. The

162

supernatant was discarded, and the particles were resuspended in 3.5 mL of ultrapure water.

163

The labeled nAu were used to make the core-shell structure by growing a PS polymer layer on the

164

surface. In a 150 mL three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermometer and a reflux

165

condenser, 0.15 g of PVP was added to a mixture of 40.25 mL of ethanol and 9.75 mL of ultrapure

166

water. While stirring at 1000 rpm, 25 µL of DVB and 475 µL of ST were added. The reaction

167

proceeded under nitrogen for one hour at 70 ℃. Subsequently, 1.5 mL of 1.7 wt.% AIBA was

168

added to the flask and stirred for 8 minutes. Following this, 3.5 mL of 4-MBA-labeled nAu were

169

added to the flask and allowed to react for one hour. The PS NP suspension was then centrifuged

170

three times with ultrapure water for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm to remove excess reactants. Finally,

171

the PS NPs were diluted to 1.2×109 particles/µL in a volume of 0.5 mL with ultrapure water. The

172

synthesized model PS NPs were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS, Zetasizer Nano

173

ZS, Malvern Instruments), TEM (JEOL JEM 2100F), and Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy (UV-

174

Vis, HP/Agilent 8453).

175

2.3 Basil plant cultivation and MNP exposure

176

Fresh basil plants were purchased from a local grocery store (Binghamton, NY, USA). The basil

177

plants were placed inside a clean chamber to ensure optimal exposure to light and a well-regulated

178

airflow. This environment was designed to simulate conditions conducive to the plant’s growth

179

and development, providing a controlled setting for experiments. In the process of leaf selection

180

for our experiments, the choice was made to choose face-up leaves. It was guided by the likelihood

181

of these leaves encountering MNPs during agricultural irrigation. Additionally, we maintained

182

consistency in leaf size by selecting leaves of similar size for each experiment. Before MNP

183

exposure, the leaf surface was gently cleaned with ultrapure water and examined by confocal

184

Raman spectroscope to ensure no MNP contamination. The basil leaves were treated with PS MPs,

185

PMMA MPs, and PS NPs at concentrations of 5.01 µg/g of leaf, 10.19 µg/g of leaf, and 0.054 µg/g

186

of leaf, respectively. A prior study has found the highest concentration of MPs in edible fruits and

187

vegetables to be 13.82 µg/g.21 Therefore, the MNP concentrations we used are within the

188

vegetable exposure range.

189

2.4 Postharvest washing methods

190

We evaluated postharvest washing techniques to determine their efficacy in removing MNPs from

191

the basil leaf surface. We specifically studied the impact of three commonly used household

192

methods: tap water rinsing, vegetable detergent washing, and sonication. To ensure the reliability

193

of results, three replicates were prepared in each group.

194

2.4.1 Tap water washing

195

The MNPs-contaminated basil leaf was placed under a running tap, and water was allowed to flow

196

vertically, directly onto the contaminated area. Care was taken to ensure that the entire

197

contaminated area surface received a thorough flush without excessive splashing, maintaining a

198

moderate flow. This flushing process was continued for 30 seconds. Following that, the basil leaf

199

was left to air dry.

200

2.4.2 Vegetable detergent washing

201

The vegetable detergent was purchased from a local supermarket. It was applied based on the user

202

guide by spraying five times onto the MNP-contaminated area of a basil leaf. The spray was

203

allowed to soak the contaminated area for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the basil leaf went through the

204

previously described tap water rinsing procedure for 30 seconds. Following the rinsing process,

205

the leaf was left to dry.

206

2.4.3 Sonication

207

For the sonication method, a Branson ultrasonic bath model 8800 was used to remove MNPs from

208

basil plant leaves. The ultrasonic bath operated at a frequency of 40 kHz, and the procedure was

209

conducted at room temperature (~25 ℃). In a 50 mL beaker, 40 mL of ultrapure water was added.

210

The basil leaf was immersed in the beaker and subjected to sonication for 1 minute. Subsequently,

211

the leaf was carefully removed from the beaker and allowed to dry.

212

2.5 Confocal Raman Microscopy Imaging

213

We used the Alpha300R advanced Raman spectroscope (WITec), featuring a 785 nm laser. This

214

advanced instrument is integrated with a confocal microscope, offering magnification options of

215

10x, 50x, and 100x. Equipped with an automated scanning system, this instrument facilitates 2D

216

SERS imaging. This capability is made possible through a motorized X-Y sample scanning stage

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

217

and Z-focusing function. Consequently, it allowed us to generate both bright-field images and

218

Raman maps of the MNPs on basil leaves. To ensure the quality of Raman imaging, we optimized

219

the instrumentation settings before detection, such as the laser power of confocal Raman,

220

integration time, and scanning step size. The collected data were processed using Project Five+ to

221

correct the spectra, extract relevant characteristic Raman peaks from spectra, and generate Raman

222

signal maps of MNPs. By utilizing this technique before and after washing, we could assess the

223

efficacy of each postharvest washing method in removing MNPs from basil leaves.

224

2.6 Postharvest washing methods efficacy quantification by ICP-MS

225

In addition to confocal Raman imaging, ICP-MS was used to better accurately quantify the efficacy

226

of these postharvest washing methods in removing model NP from basil leaves. The model NP

227

required acid digestion before ICP-MS due to its structure, which consists of a PS shell

228

surrounding a gold core. The initial step in ICP-MS sample preparation involved sonicating the

229

model NP particles with basil leaves for 5 minutes to break down the PS shell. To digest the gold

230

core of the model NP for ICP-MS detection of the gold element, we digested them with 1 mL of

231

aqua regia at room temperature for 2 hours. Lastly, the digested samples were filtered using

232

Biomed Scientific’s Nylon Syringe Filters, which have a 25 mm diameter and a pore size of 0.45

233

µm and diluted to the desired concentrations for ICP-MS analysis. To ensure the gold

234

concentration was sufficiently high for detection by ICP-MS, we applied 10 1 µL droplets of 0.054

235

µg/g of model NP on basil leaves, which is significantly more than what was used for confocal

236

Raman imaging. To compare the washing efficacies in removing model NP from basil leaves, four

237

groups of samples were prepared: model NP on basil leaves before washing, model NP on basil

238

leaves after washing with tap water, model NP on basil leaves after washing with detergent, and

239

model NP on basil leaves after sonication. Each group included three replicates to ensure accuracy.

3. Results and discussion

241

In this project, three postharvest washing methods were used to remove MNPs from basil leaves.

242

The results aim to determine whether the applied methods are effective for MNP removal and, if

243

not, to identify the most effective washing approach among the techniques. We used two types of

244

MPs - PS (42 µm) and PMMA (6 µm), and one type of NP - model PS (61 nm) to evaluate the

245

efficacy of different washing techniques in removing MNPs from vegetable leaves. To begin the

246

experiment, we applied 0.5~1.0 µL droplet of each type of plastic particle suspension onto basil

247

leaves. Microscopic images were taken before and after washing to visually observe the difference

248

in MNP presence. Additionally, Raman surface area scans were conducted to generate Raman

249

maps before and after washing to track the removal of MNPs. The three washing methods were

250

30-second tap water flushing; immersion in vegetable detergent for 5 minutes followed by a 30-

251

second tap water flush; and a 1-minute sonication in a beaker. Tap water rinsing is a common

252

routine practice in most households, while vegetable detergent washing is often used in either

253

household or commercial facilities for cleaning produce. Sonication technique involves the use of

254

high-frequency ultrasound waves to dislodge particles from vegetable surfaces and is a method

255

with potential advantages in small particle removal. Assessing these common methods will

256

advance our understanding of their cleaning efficacy and offer valuable insights for pollutant

257

removal method development in the future. The PS MPs and PMMA MPs were purchased from

258

the manufacturer. To confirm their sizes, we captured their microscopic images, and measured the

259

sizes with ImageJ, obtaining an average size of 42 ± 0.23 µm for PS MPs and 6 ± 1.3 µm for

260

PMMA MPs (Fig. S1).

261

3.1 MNP characterization

262

To evaluate the removal of NPs by different washing methods, we developed a novel NP model

263

that allows multi-dimensional imaging of NPs by SERS. The model NPs consist of Raman

264

indicator-labeled nAu (also called SERS nanotags) as the core and a plastic layer as the shell that

265

simulates the target plastic surface. The nAu core enhances Raman indicator signals so that model

266

NPs can be tracked directly by SERS. SERS is an advanced technique that integrates normal

267

Raman spectroscopy with nanotechnology. Unlike conventional Raman spectroscopy, SERS

268

achieves higher sensitivity through the integration of noble metal nanoparticles, significantly

269

increasing Raman signals by orders of magnitude (105~1010).40 SERS has several unique

270

advantages for imaging NPs in biological systems: 1) it has high stability and is not affected by

271

photobleaching or biological autofluorescence in contrast to fluorescence-based methods; 2)

272

Raman bands are narrower than fluorescence bands, providing molecular information with

273

differentiable bands and higher chemical specificity; 3) A Raman spectroscope collects spectra

274

within seconds and enables real-time fast continuous scanning; and 4) non-contact and non-

275

destructive analysis allows biological samples to be used for further examination. The innovative

276

integration of SERS nanotag-labeled nanoplastics (model PS NPs) with the confocal SERS

277

technique makes NPs traceable in biological samples.

278

After we synthesized the model PS NPs with SERS nanotags embedded using in-situ

279

polymerization, we characterized the size and morphology using TEM. The TEM image clearly

280

showed that the nAu cores were covered by a PS layer, creating a spherical core-shell structure

281

(Fig. 1a, 1b). PS NPs (50 particles) were measured with ImageJ to determine the average size of

282

the gold core and the thickness of the PS layer. The average nAu core diameter was 33.6 ± 0.65

283

nm. The PS shell thickness was 13.7 ± 0.18 nm, adding to 61.0 ± 0.66 nm (diameter) for the whole

284

core-shell PS NP.

Fig. 1. Panels a-b are the TEM images of PS NPs, with panel a showing an enlarged image of one
particle in core-shell structure. Panel c shows the comparison of Raman spectra between nAu (without
tagging 4-MBA) and synthesized PS NPs. Panel d is the UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the
synthesized PS NPs and nAu.

285

To examine if the nAu cores were labeled by the Raman indicator 4-MBA, we collected Raman

286

spectra from both nAu and PS NPs. As observed in Fig. 1c, the model PS NPs displayed strong

287

SERS signals (characteristic peaks of 4-MBA at 1077 cm-1 and 1585 cm-1). Compared to the nAu

288

cores (without tagging 4-MBA), the model PS NPs showed a distinct Raman spectrum pattern with

289

significantly higher SERS signal intensity. In addition, the characteristic peak of PS is observed at

290

1001 cm-1 in the spectrum of model PS NPs, proving the successful formation of PS shell on nAu

291

cores. However, the signal intensity at 1001 cm-1 is much lower than the peaks from the Raman

292

indicator 4-MBA, suggesting that without using the Raman indicator 4-MBA, tracking PS NPs

293

using the signal from PS itself would be challenging. Therefore, labeling the model NP cores with

294

the Raman indicator 4-MBA is critical. Further, the UV-Vis spectra were recorded, which

295

underwent a redshift in the absorption maxima following the formation of PS on the nAu cores.

296

(Fig. 1d). This shift can be attributed to both the increase in particle diameter and the presence of

297

the PS coating.

298

3.2 Tap water washing

299

In this study, we first evaluated the tap water washing method for removing MNPs from basil

300

leaves. To start with, we used PS MPs (42 µm) because they are observable under the Raman

301

microscope due to their bigger size and strong Raman peaks even without any SERS tracers inside.

302

Microscopic photos of PS MPs on a basil leaf before and after washing are shown in Fig. 2a and

303

2e, with the corresponding scanned areas marked in a red square. The Raman maps based on the

304

characteristic peak of PS MPs (1001 cm-1) showed a notable difference before and after washing

305

with tap water. Raman signals of PS MPs were detectable before washing (Fig. 2b), but no signals

306

were found afterward (Fig. 2f). The Raman map signals successfully matched the MPs observed

307

in the microscopic images. To further demonstrate this, the overlaid images (Fig. 2c, 2g) confirmed

308

that the signals correspond to PS MPs. The average Raman spectra of three replicates collected

309

from the Raman maps are shown in Fig. 2d. The intensity of the PS characteristic Raman peak

310

was notably higher before washing, but it significantly dropped after washing. This observation

311

aligned with the Raman mapping results. The findings of all three replicates indicated that the tap

312

water postharvest washing method was highly effective in removing PS MPs (42 µm). To compare

313

each cleaning method in removing MNPs from basil leaves, the removal efficacies were calculated

314

(Fig. S7) using the Removal Efficacy (RE) equation: RE = [(Raman intensity before washing -

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

315

Raman intensity after washing) / (Raman intensity before washing)] * 100%. The RE of the tap

316

water washing method for removing PS MPs was calculated to be 93.1%.

Fig. 2. Panels a-c show the microscopic image, Raman map scanned in the red square, and their overlaid
image, respectively, for the sample with PS MPs (42 µm) on basil leaf before washing with tap water method.
Panels e-g are the results for the same sample at the same scanned area after washing with the tap water
method. The color scale bar of Raman mapping is shown in panel h. The average Raman spectra scanned on
the leaf surfaces before and after washing with tap water method are shown in panel d. The characteristic peak
of PS (1001 cm-1) is marked with the arrow.

317

Subsequently, we applied the same washing method to assess its efficacy in removing smaller

318

particles. Specifically, we focused on PMMA MPs with an average size of 6 µm. The scan area

319

was randomly selected due to the uniform distribution of PMMA MP on the basil leaves as shown

320

in Fig. S2. Based on the observation from the microscopic images (Fig. 3a, 3e), it was noted that

321

a significant portion of the particles was removed, although a considerable number of PMMA MPs

322

remained. The Raman maps also reflected this difference, with the post-washing map showing

323

lower signals (Fig. 3b, 3f). Overlaid images were generated to visually represent the locations

324

where signals were detected (Fig. 3c, 3g). The Raman spectra (Fig. 3d) demonstrated the partial

325

removal of PMMA MPs from basil leaves by tap water washing with a RE of 51.6%, which aligned

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

326

with the visual observation from the microscopic images. To achieve more effective removal of

327

small plastic particles, like 6 µm PMMA MPs, other postharvest washing methods are needed.

Fig. 3. Panels a-c show the microscopic image, Raman map scanned in the red square, and their overlaid
image, respectively, for the sample with PMMA MPs (6 µm) on basil leaf before washing with tap water
method. Panels e-g are the results for the same sample at the same scanned area after washing with the
tap water method. The color scale bar of Raman mapping is shown in panel h. The average Raman
spectra scanned on the leaf surfaces before and after washing with tap water method are shown in panel
d. The characteristic peak of PMMA (811 cm-1) is marked with the arrow.

328

The third type of plastic particles we assessed using tap water washing was the PS NPs (61 nm)

329

synthesized above as the model NPs. Microscopic images were captured before and after washing

330

in the same scanned area (Fig. S5a, S5e). However, because of their small size, individual particles

331

of PS NP were not visible under the microscope. Considering the non-uniform distribution of PS

332

NP droplets on the basil leaves (Fig. S3), to ensure an accurate assessment of the washing methods’

333

efficacy, we chose to focus on the “coffee ring” during scanning. This area is the edge of the dried

334

droplet where particles accumulate, enabling us to obtain the most distinct results for evaluating

335

RE. Surprisingly, the Raman map showed stronger signals after washing the NP-contaminated leaf,

336

with maximum intensity in one pixel reaching 200 CCD cts (Fig. S5b, S5f). To confirm that we

337

scanned the identical area, we created an overlaid image (Fig. S5c, S5g), which verified our

338

scanning accuracy. Fig. S5d showed the average SERS spectra of three replicates before and after

339

washing. Consistently, all replicates demonstrated the same outcome: the average Raman intensity

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

340

increased in the scanned “coffee ring” area, indicating that the tap water washing method was

341

ineffective in removing NPs from basil leaves. The increase in Raman intensity after washing was

342

possibly attributed to the flushing action of tap water, which relocated some NPs to the “coffee

343

ring”. This was tested through tap water washing of the PS NP on a smooth aluminum foil surface,

344

and the same phenomenon occurred wherein the “coffee ring” area exhibited increased Raman

345

signal intensity post-washing. (Fig. S4). The result suggested that the accumulation is mainly due

346

to the “coffee ring” rather than the leaf surface structure.

347

The outcomes from the tap water washing method suggest its high efficacy in eliminating larger

348

plastics such as 42 µm PS MPs. However, for smaller MNPs like 6 µm PMMA MPs and 61 nm

349

PS NPs, the tap water washing method proved much less effective. The discovery underscores the

350

significance of our study, revealing that tap water rinsing, as the most used household washing

351

method, is insufficient for removing smaller-sized plastics. In the interest of food safety and public

352

health, it is important to evaluate additional cleaning methods.

353

3.3 Vegetable detergent washing

354

Another common household cleaning method we chose to test is vegetable detergent for washing.

355

This approach holds promise because it has the potential to change the surface properties of both

356

plastics and basil leaves such as hydrophilicity, which might facilitate the following rinsing

357

process with tap water. We specifically selected PMMA MPs and model NPs for this evaluation,

358

considering their resistance to being removed by tap water rinsing alone.

359

The microscopic images captured before and after washing the PMMA MPs-contaminated leaf

360

surface (Fig. 4a, 4e) clearly showed the effective removal of the particles. The Raman maps further

361

confirmed a decrease in detected signals after the washing process (Fig. 4b, 4f). Averaged Raman

362

spectra of three replicates (Fig. 4d) proved our hypothesis that soaking with vegetable detergent

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

363

followed by tap water rinsing was more effective in removing PMMA MPs than washing with tap

364

water alone, with a RE of 73.3%.

Fig. 4. Panels a-c show the microscopic image, Raman map scanned in the red square, and their overlaid
image, respectively, for the sample with PMMA MPs (6 µm) on basil leaf before washing with vegetable
detergent method. Panels e-g are the results for the same sample at the same scanned area after washing
with the vegetable detergent method. The color scale bar of Raman mapping is shown in panel h. The
average Raman spectra scanned on the leaf surfaces before and after washing with the vegetable
detergent method are shown in panel d. The characteristic peak of PMMA (811 cm-1) is marked with the
arrow.

365

To assess the removal of PS NPs by vegetable detergent-assisted washing, the identical area was

366

scanned before and after cleaning along the border of the “coffee ring” (Fig. S6a, S6e). In Fig.

367

S6b, the Raman map clearly shows the border of the dried PS NP droplet. However, after cleaning,

368

the border became indistinct, and the shape of the droplet changed in Fig. S6f. Looking at the pixel

369

colors in the Raman maps, it became obvious that the intensity increased, indicating a higher

370

Raman intensity after cleaning. The overlaid images (Fig. S6c, S6g) once again confirmed the

371

increase of PS NPs in the “coffee ring” after cleaning. To confirm this, we conducted three

372

replicates, averaged the results, and generated Raman spectra, with results showing higher post-

373

washing intensity compared to the pre-washing Raman intensity (Fig. S6d). This outcome parallels

374

our findings from the tap water washing method, suggesting that the vegetable detergent cleaning

375

method was ineffective in removing PS NPs from basil leaf and may relocate the PS NP particles

376

to the “coffee ring” area (Fig. S4). The outcomes of this detergent cleaning method indicate its

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

377

capability to partially remove PMMA MPs from basil leaves, which had better efficacy than

378

rinsing with tap water alone. However, for PS NPs, no removal was observed. Further cleaning

379

strategies are still needed to address this challenge.

380

3.4 Sonication

381

We further assessed another cleaning method, sonication, to evaluate its efficacy in removing

382

PMMA MPs and PS NPs from basil leaves. The hypothesis is that sonication could render the

383

particles unstable on the basil leaf surface, facilitating their removal. The decrease in the amount

384

of PMMA MPs post-washing was visible in the microscopic images. While a portion was removed,

385

a considerable number of particles remained on the basil leaf surface after cleaning (Fig. 5a, 5e).

386

The Raman maps and overlaid images visually indicated a reduction in the number of particles, as

387

fewer pixels exhibited signals after the cleaning process (Fig. 5b, 5c, 5f, 5g). In addition, the

388

Raman spectra revealed the Raman intensity of the PMMA characteristic peak before and after

389

cleaning (Fig. 5d), with a removal efficacy of 22.6%. This shows the inadequacy of this cleaning

390

method to eliminate PMMA MPs from the basil leaf surface.

Fig. 5. Panels a-c show the microscopic image, Raman map scanned in the red square, and their overlaid
image, respectively, for the sample with PMMA MPs (6 µm) on basil leaf before sonication. Panels e-g are the
results for the same sample at the same scanned area after sonication. The color scale bar of Raman
mapping is shown in panel h. The average Raman spectra scanned on the leaf surfaces before and after
sonication are shown in panel d. The characteristic peak of PMMA (811 cm-1) is marked with the arrow.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

391

The same washing and detection protocol was applied to model PS NPs. The identical area was

392

scanned by confocal Raman spectroscopy before and after sonication (Fig. 6). The average Raman

393

spectra of the three replicates observed a slight reduction in intensity (Fig. 6d), with a removal

394

efficacy of 11.1%, suggesting that sonication was better than the other two washing methods.

395

However, in terms of effective removal, the sonication method is still insufficient.

Fig. 6. Panels a-c show the microscopic image, Raman map scanned in the red square, and their overlaid
image, respectively, for the sample with model NPs (61 nm) on basil leaf before sonication. Panels e-g are
the results for the same sample at the same scanned area after sonication. The color scale bar of Raman
mapping is shown in panel h. The average Raman spectra scanned on the leaf surfaces before and after
sonication are shown in panel d. The characteristic peak of model PS NP (1078 cm-1) is marked with the
arrow.

396

3.5 model NP removal efficacy quantification by ICP-MS

397

Due to the results showing for the model NP removal, both the tap water washing method and

398

detergent washing method exhibited negative removal efficacy. The hypothesis is that particles

399

became trapped in the “coffee ring” of the droplet while washing. To gain a better understanding

400

of the removal process, we used ICP-MS to quantify the difference in gold content on the entire

401

basil leaves before and after washing, providing a more reliable measurement. As shown in Fig.

402

S7, the removal efficacies of the tap water method and detergent method for removing model NP

403

from bail leaves are relatively low, with removal efficacies of 16.46% and 16.85%, respectively.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

404

These results are consistent with the findings from confocal Raman imaging. However, the

405

removal efficacy of 59.8% for the sonication method demonstrated its effectiveness in removing

406

model NP from basil leaves, which is also consistent with the confocal Raman imaging results.

407

The ICP-MS quantification results further confirmed that the tap water and detergent washing

408

methods are not effective enough to remove the model NP from basil leaves. These findings also

409

support the hypothesis that the model NPs are relocated and trapped in the “coffee ring” during

410

the washing process.

411

4. Conclusion

412

The results from three replicates consistently demonstrated that the tap water washing method was

413

highly effective in eliminating PS MPs (42 µm) with an average removal efficacy of 93.1%. In

414

contrast, the tap water washing method proved less effective in removing the 6 µm PMMA MP

415

particles, with a RE of only 51.6%. These observations suggest that the RE is influenced by particle

416

size and/or polymer type when using the tap water washing method. Among the three washing

417

methods evaluated for PMMA MPs removal, the vegetable detergent method exhibited the highest

418

RE, reaching up to 73.3%, while the sonication method only had a RE of 22.6%. Vegetable

419

detergents containing surfactants can effectively lower the surface tension of water on vegetable

420

leaves, facilitating the easier spreading of water over surfaces, and enabling water to lift surface

421

contaminates and carry them away.41 The method involved vegetable detergent soaking and a step

422

of flushing with tap water, which enhanced the removal of PMMA particles from the basil leaves

423

compared to flushing with tap water alone. To specifically examine the impact of particle size, we

424

used the same polymer type, PS, but in a smaller size, PS NPs (61 nm) for evaluating the tap water

425

washing method. The tap water washing method only exhibited a low removal efficacy of 16.5%.

426

A similar phenomenon occurred with vegetable detergent washing for removing PS NPs. They

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qmfsc ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-1330-995X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

427

both suggest that tap water and vegetable detergent washing methods could relocate the PS NP

428

particles, leading them to be trapped in the “coffee ring” (Fig. S4). Both methods failed to remove

429

PS NPs from the basil leaf surfaces significantly while the sonication method exhibited the

430

potential to partially remove PS NPs with a RE of 59.8%. This study provides valuable information

431

and an approach to evaluate the RE of different washing methods in removing MNP contamination

432

from fresh produce. The outcomes of this study underscore the need for the development of new

433

and more effective decontamination techniques for MNP removal in the future.
