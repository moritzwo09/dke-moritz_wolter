Abstract

11

Characterizing chemical composition of semen can provide valuable insights into the exposome

12

and environmental factors that directly affect seminal and overall health. In this study, we

13

compared molecular profiles of 45 donated semen samples from general population New York City

14

participants and examined the correlation between the chemical profiles in semen vs. fertility

15

parameters, i.e., sperm count, sperm morphology, sperm motility and semen volume. Samples

16

were prepared using a protein precipitation procedure and analyzed using liquid chromatography

17

(LC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Non-targeted analysis (NTA) revealed

18

eighteen chemicals not previously reported in human exposome studies, with 3-

19

hydroxyoctanedioic acid, a cosmetic additive, emerging as a plausible candidate found to be at

20

higher levels in cases vs. controls (p < 0.01) and associated with adverse sperm motility and

21

morphology.

This study aims to be the first of its kind to utilize NTA to understand the association of

23

contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) along with a full chemical profile to find trends

24

separating poor and normal semen health parameters from each other chemically. Our results

25

suggest that the collective effects of many CECs could adversely affect semen quality.

1 Introduction

27

Male infertility

28

Infertility is defined as the failure to establish clinical pregnancy after 12 or more months of regular,

29

unprotected intercourse. Worldwide it is estimated to impact up to 12% of couples within

30

reproductive age, with 50% of overall cases due to male-specific infertility [1]. Critically, male-

31

specific infertility is an indicator of poor overall health, with increased rates of cancer [2,3], heart

32

disease [4,5], diabetes [6] and early mortality [4,7,8] all corresponding with a decline in male

33

reproductive health [9,10]. Over the nearly thirty-year period between 1990 and 2019 the rate of

34

male infertility is estimated to have increased by 75-80% [11,12,13]. Trends are most drastic for

35

younger males. Those under 30 years of age have experienced a 15% greater impact than those

36

over 30 years of age in the same timeframe [14,15]. Though fewer than 10% of men with fertility

37

issues in the United States seek regular services to solve them, those who do can spend up to 20%

38

of their annual income on treatments and expenses [16]. There is, therefore, a significant economic

39

impact from male infertility, not only in terms of healthcare costs associated with coinciding

40

medical issues, but also fertility treatment.

41

The semen exposome and environmental contributors

42

Environmental exposures to anthropogenic pollutants are suspected to contribute to the historical

43

decline in male reproductive health and semen quality [17,18,19]. Industrial, high production

44

pollutants, such as chlorophenols, nitrophenols, vinyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, phthalates,

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

45

acetaldehyde, and other antiandrogens have all produced animal and human fertility decline in

46

controlled In Vitro studies by disrupting enzyme function, changing androgen-targeting tissues and

47

altering spermatogenesis and sperm morphology (physical shape and characteristics) [17,19].

48

Heavy metals and pesticides have also been shown to negatively impact the mechanism and effect

49

of male reproductive organ processes through In Vivo animal and human epidemiological studies

50

[17,18,19]. There is growing understanding of which exogenous compounds are present in human

51

semen [20]. Chemicals found range from clear anthropomorphic sources, such as pesticides,

52

phthalates and pharmaceutical products, to more ambiguous and naturally occurring sources,

53

such as purines, furans, benzaldehydes and organic acids [21]. Recent studies have aimed to

54

examine associations between specific chemical classes and semen health. For example,

55

halogenated compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl

56

ethers (PBDEs), and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) have shown limited association with poor

57

semen health outcomes (sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm morphology, seminal

58

volume and total sperm count) [22,23]. Of particular interest are contaminants of emerging

59

concern (CEC), which are becoming more prevalent in the modern environment [24,25,26,27].

60

CECs include pesticides, such as atrazine and diamino chlorotriazine, persistent organic

61

pollutants (POPs) like chlorophenols, industrial by-products such as benzotriazoles and dioxins,

62

flame retardants/suppressors and surfactants such as polybrominated diphenyl ether and

63

perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFAS, phthalates, and heavy metals have been the three most

64

analyzed groups in human blood, semen and urine in recent years using targeted methods [28,29].

65

Many of the methods assessing exogenous contributions to poor semen focus on the many

66

environmental factors that produce them. Smoking, for example, introduces many toxins directly

67

into the lungs through primary and secondary exposure [30]. Industrial products, including

68

bisphenols, phthalates, heavy metals, nitrophenols and acetaldehydes can be introduced through

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

69

water, air and in contaminated food [31,32,33]. Non-targeted analysis (NTA) approaches designed

70

to analyze a wide range of known and potentially new chemical sources are seeing increased use in

71

medical research. Previously unknown sources of disease have been found, such as liquid crystal

72

monomers found in dust and soil [34], and benzopyran-based pesticides and phenolic industrial

73

waste in blood and prenatal samples [35,36]. The impact of individual CECs and distinct classes of

74

CECs have been well studied [24,25,26,27]; however, the combined environmental presence,

75

impact and treatment of many different classes of CEC together in the environment is less known

76

and would utilize the chemical coverage offered by NTA using LC-HRMS [24,37]. Furthering this

77

knowledge could improve the understanding of male reproductive and overall health more than the

78

study of individual chemicals and classes [31,38,39,40].

79

Exposomic profiling using non-targeted MS-based approaches

80

NTA, by design, does not limit itself to individual chemicals or chemical classes. It can screen

81

thousands of chemicals in case and control patients to look for new features of interest

82

[40,41,42,43]. Identification can often be challenging with complex matrices. High-resolution mass

83

spectrometry (HRMS) separates based on very small differences in mass, which is crucial to the

84

identification and intensity of individual ions in NTA [43]. Examples of HRMS-based chemical-

85

disease relationship and/or biomarker studies include the relationship between di-isononyl

86

phthalate metabolites and liver disease [40], and the identification of hundreds of pharmaceutical

87

biomarkers in human urine and saliva [44,45].

88

HRMS identification and validation should include consistent detection of compounds across

89

replicates and should attempt to utilize known standards for confirmation [43]. Databases such as

90

the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) CompTox Chemicals Dashboard

91

(henceforth referred to as the “CompTox Dashboard”), a regularly updated database containing

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

92

diverse information (e.g., physicochemical properties, environmental fate and transport, exposure,

93

usage, in vivo and in vitro toxicity) on over 1,200,000 known chemicals [46], the Human Blood

94

Exposome database [47], and PubChem through the National Institute of Science and Technology

95

(NIST) [48] are constantly expanding. In addition, tools such as the Metaboanalyst® [49] exposure

96

enrichment tool, can be used. The exposure enrichment tool accepts a list of compound names

97

and concentrations, analyzing them against 15 libraries containing ≈13,000 biologically meaningful

98

metabolite sets collected primarily from human studies including >1500 chemical classes,

99

providing tentative insight into the source of metabolites in biological samples. These databases

100

and tools grant new opportunities to better define chemical exposures link them to outcomes.

101

In this study, we plan to use NTA to profile chemicals in semen of young adult men in New York

102

City. We aim to discover compounds that have been overlooked using conventional targeted

103

methods. Our analysis will measure infertility parameters, i.e., sperm concentration, sperm

104

motility, sperm morphology and semen volume, providing associations between the chemical

105

profiles and sperm quality. Finally, using the exposure enrichment tool, we will use the chemicals

106

associated with these trends to highlight exposure pathways that are prevalent in low quality

107

semen compared to healthy controls.

2.1 Participant Information, Sample Collection and Storage

114

Between September 2022 and February 2023, 45 healthy men within the eligible range of 18-45

115

years of age from the New York City area enrolled in the study. All participants were informed about

116

the study in various ways, including social media posts, physical flyers, and an internal system

117

called iConnect. Each participant reported no diagnosed medical condition or use of any

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

118

medication or supplement associated with poor semen quality. After providing informed consent,

119

each filled out a baseline questionnaire before attending a single study visit. Up to 24 hours prior to

120

their study visit, participants completed a 24-hour diet recall survey [50]. On the day of the study

121

visit, they provided a semen sample at a local andrology lab (Repro Lab) following 2-7 days of

122

ejaculatory abstinence, then walked to the NYU Environmental Pediatrics research clinic where

123

they had anthropometric measurements taken and provided a urine sample. Participants had a

124

mean age of 28.9 years (range: 23-38) and median body mass index of 24.2 kg/m2 (interquartile

125

range [IQR]: 23.0-26.3).

126

Semen samples were analyzed following liquefaction at room temperature in accordance with

127

World Health Organization 1999 and 2010 reference recommendations [51], and standard semen

128

parameters were reported. The remaining samples were aliquoted into 1.8 mL polypropylene tubes

129

and frozen at -80 °C before being transported to NYU Langone Health for analysis.

130

2.2 Semen Health Parameters

131

Table S4 in the Supporting Information provides details on semen health parameters collected

132

from individual donors. Thresholds for dichotomized high/low values were based on the values

133

outlined in the WHO 1999 and 2010 reference values [51,52]. Each of the semen quality

134

parameters were given binary values (i.e. a value of 0 if above the WHO reference level, a value of 1

135

if below the reference level). Sperm morphology, or the size and shape of sperm when viewed with

136

a microscope, was assessed to give samples a percent normal morphology. For the purposes of

137

this study 30% normal sperm morphology was used as the upper limit for low morphology. The

138

WHO criterion for low motility was an upper limit of 50% motile, and the threshold for low

139

concentration/count was 20×106/mL. These values were all interpreted to have clinical relevance

140

for male fertility [53]. An upper threshold of 2 mL was used for low semen volume.

141

2.3 Standard Makeup and Analysis

142

An external standard solution for compound retention time and mass confirmation was made from

143

three mixes of selected compounds of potential interest. These compounds range from known

144

pesticides to food additives, over-the-counter drugs, vehicle fluids, and cleaning components. The

145

full list of compounds and their identification information is included in Table S1 in the Supporting

146

Information. Dilutions were made so that the concentration of each analyte was equivalent to 100

147

ppb (100 µg/L or 1/10000000 v/v) in acetonitrile.

148

2.4 Protein precipitation

149

Frozen 1.8 mL aliquots of semen were removed from -80 °C and allowed to thaw for a minimum of 1

150

hour before extraction. All volumetric pipetting was done with a 200 µL adjustable Reference2

151

pipette (Eppendorf, Enfield, CT) with 200 µL tips (Finntip, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

152

Figure 2 shows a schematic of the sample preparation and analysis procedure. 100 µL of sample

153

was pipetted into a 1.7 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube (Corning, Phoenix, AZ), followed by

154

400 µL of HPLC grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH). The mixture was vortexed for

155

20 s at 1500 rpm using a 100-240V lab vortex mixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and

156

allowed to stand for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm using a

157

miniSpin 5452 centrifuge (Eppendorf, Enfield, CT). A glass Pasteur pipette was then used to

158

transfer the supernatant to a 3 mL syringe with a 0.2 µm pore size filter (Monoject, Cardinal Health,

159

Dublin, OH), which was then used to dispense the final precipitated and filtered sample into a 300

160

µL polyspring amber glass insert vial (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). One method blank

161

of 400 µL acetonitrile and 100 µL HPLC grade water (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) was prepared

162

identically to samples for every eleven real samples (five method blanks for each set of replicates).

166

2.5 Non-targeted LC-MS/MS Analysis

167

Analysis was performed using a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC System coupled to an Exploris 240

168

Orbitrap (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Details of mobile phases, flow information

169

and mass spectral parameters can be found in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. Briefly, the

170

aqueous phase (solvent A) was 99.9% HPLC water with 0.1% HPLC methanol, while the organic

171

phase (solvent B) was 90% HPLC methanol with 10% HPLC water. LC solvents were all obtained

172

from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH). Both solvent mixtures had 5 mM ammonium acetate added.

173

The analytical column used was a 2.1×100 mm, 1.8 µm pore size Eclipse Plus C18 column. Flow was

174

set to a constant 0.150 mL/min, with the following solvent flow gradient: start at 10% solvent B for 1

175

min, ramp to 100% solvent B for 14 min, hold at 100% solvent B for 5 min, re-equilibrate at 10%

176

solvent B for 3 min. Mass voltage for positive ionization mode was set to 3500 V and scanned for

177

105-1050 m/z with a resolution of 60 000. Negative ionization mode was set to 2500 V with identical

178

m/z and resolution settings. Five quality control (QC) samples were run within the sequence using

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

179

400 µL of the 100 ppb standard mixture in acetonitrile and 100 µL HPLC grade water. This QC

180

mixture consisted of Mixture 1 from Table S1 and was used to ensure consistent mass and

181

retention time values for analytes. QC, method blank and real samples were run together in a

182

randomized order, two replicates per ionization mode (positive/negative).

183

2.6 Raw File Processing and Identification

184

Raw files obtained from the MS system were processed using MS-Dial software [53]. Details of

185

parameters used are included in Table S3 in the Supporting Information.

186

Mass spectral libraries MSMS_Public_EXP_Pos_VS17 (positive ionization) and

187

MSMS_Public_EXP_NEG_VS17 (negative ionization) were used for mass spectral matches, with

188

additional matches done through PubChem FTP. MS/MS matches of 70/100 and higher were

189

categorized as Level 2 identified, while MS matches of 70/100 and higher were categorized as Level

190

3. Molecular formula matches based on mass were categorized as Level 4, with unknowns

191

generating an accurate mass measurement being categorized as Level 5. Literature research was

192

done on Level 1 and Level 2 chemicals, as well as those that produced notable molecular

193

formulae. Level 2 spectral matches that did not meet visual inspection comparison were

194

downgraded to level 3. A shortlist of level 1 and level 2 compounds that did not appear in Blood

195

Exposome Database [47] searches was made, noting them as potentially novel or understudied.

196

Identification standards (Table S1) were used to determine the presence of a list of suspect

197

compounds within samples. Compounds that consistently matched retention time within 0.3 min

198

retention time and 5 ppm mass were categorized as Level 1 identified based on the guidelines by

199

Sumner et al, 2007 [54]. A full list of level 1 identified compounds is included in Spreadsheet S7 of

200

the Supporting Information.

2.7 Data Processing

202

The first step in preparing the data was to eliminate peaks that were suspected to be instrument

203

noise. A peak area of 10000 AU was set as the minimum with all peaks below set to zero. We then

204

applied a normal distribution to data points using calculated median and standard deviation values

205

from experimental data. The model then produced random values between the minimum

206

experimental value and the absolute minimum (zero) following the shape of the distribution. Peaks

207

with significant intensity in blanks (within 100000 AMU area of value in sample) were removed from

208

sample data tables. The initial processing steps dictate the minimum measured value, based on a

209

set cut-off point in the chromatograms. This point, providing a safe margin from the baseline, is set

210

in NTA studies due to the unknown method detection limit. The code for the imputation is available

211

as Supporting Information on GitHub

212

(https://github.com/johnsont114/UrineSemen_UsedinProcessing) as “imputation.py”.

213

Batch correction was performed using a Combat2 algorithm. Batches of samples were separated

214

into groups of 12 (11 samples and 1 blank) to form preparation batches, and groups of 50 (samples

215

run in a single day) to form instrument analysis batches. QC samples containing mixture 1 from

216

Table S1 were run along with each batch (inter-preparation-batch and inter-day) to support that

217

batch correction statistically removed variation observed between batches and that variation was

218

coming from samples, not batch numbers. Example principal component analysis (PCA) plots of

219

these corrections are displayed in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

220

2.8 Statistics and Interpretation

221

We used a regression model to examine the relationship between each compound and each

222

semen quality parameter. To ensure that our results were not skewed by the large number of

223

comparisons we were making, we used a technique called the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

224

discovery rate [55]. This method helps us control the chance of getting false positives in results by

225

setting a threshold for significance.

226

We then used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to further analyze the compounds that showed

227

the greatest significance in our t-tests. The compounds that were considered highly significant

228

were those that met the criteria of Equation 1. In this equation, 'l' represents the rank of the p-

229

value, 'm' is the total number of values, and 'Q' is the false discovery rate, which we tested at 0.05

230

and 0.10. These leave a 5% and 10% chance of getting a false positive in our results, respectively.

231

The full processed datasets for positive and negative ionization are included as supplementary

232

spreadsheets on GitHub (https://github.com/johnsont114/NTA-Semen-NYC_ProcessedData).

233

Equation 1

234

To obtain chemical exposure enrichment information a list of compounds with p < 0.05 association

235

with each semen health parameter were input into Metaboanalyst® 6.0 exposure enrichment

236

analysis [49]. Metaboanalyst® functions using compound name, so a minimum of level 3

237

identification was required for input. All three levels (level 1, level 2 and level 3) were used to

238

produce enrichment diagrams.

3.2 Non-Targeted Overview and Compound Associations with Semen Health

251

Displayed in Table 2 are the compounds identified at different levels of confidence throughout the

252

study based on the identification guidelines by Sumner et al, 2007 [54]. Between all combined

253

semen samples, 48595 chemical features were detected. 7348 were tentatively identified with MS

254

(minimum level 3), 363 with MS/MS (minimum level 2), and 33 had their identities supported with

255

standards (level 1). Table 2 also displays the number of features at levels 1, 2 and 3 that were

256

associated in some way (positively or negatively) with each semen health parameter with a t-test p-

257

value less than 0.05.

Eighteen previously unreported exposomic chemicals were identified at level 2 confidence using

261

MS/MS spectra and libraries (4 in negative mode, 14 in positive mode). Novelty was determined by

comparing the compounds’ identification information, formula and SMILES with the existing Blood

263

Exposome Database [47], which, since no semen-specific database exists, we deemed the most

264

relevant database to use in this study. Manual searches were also done in Google Scholar for

265

research specific to each chemical. Four of the eighteen unreported chemicals were associated

266

with semen health parameters (p < 0.05) and are included in Table 3. Comparison of experimental

267

and literature mass spectra only yielded 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid as a plausible candidate. Box

268

plots comparing chromatographic peak abundances between cases and controls are shown in

269

Figure 3. The two associations for 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid showed significant differences (p <

270

0.01) between cases and controls. 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid was associated with low motility

271

(Figure 3A) and low morphology (Figure 3B). A full list with details of the eighteen potentially novel

272

compounds is included in Spreadsheet S6 in the Supporting Information. Visual comparisons of

motility and low morphology. The positive ionization of low concentration (Figure 4A) showed

298

trends away, but not clear separation from healthy concentration samples. This is reflected in the

3.3 Exposure Pathway Analysis

330

Seen in Table 4 is the Metaboanalyst® 6.0 exposure enrichment data produced when the level 1,

331

level 2 and level 3 identified compounds associated with semen health parameters were input. No

332

internal process was used to confirm or validate the figures or pathways, and exposure enrichment

333

does not consider concentration or intensity of chemicals for its calculations. Therefore, the

334

results should be considered tentative to provide insight to the behaviour of chemicals and

335

metabolites identified in this study. The pathways were required to have a raw p-value of ≤ 0.001

336

and a false discovery rate (FDR) of ≤ 0.05. Low concentration, motility and volume all indicated that

337

the most significant pathway associated was traffic-related air pollution exposure, with the only

338

consumption-related pathway being marjoram consumption in low motility.

4 Discussion

348

A major aim of this study was to find associations between semen health outcomes and chemical

349

trends through NTA. HRMS can make very precise chemical mass measurements, providing a

350

distinct advantage for compound identification and comparative measurements of instrument

351

response between the same chemical in different samples. Our results indicate potential chemical

352

associations between environmental pollutants and semen health. Furthermore, the identification

353

of multiple new chemical associations with health parameters suggests that the chemical drivers

354

of poor male fertility are complex and can come from many sources.

355

Level 1 and level 2 identified compounds fell into 32 classes of compound, detailed in Figure S8 in

356

the Supporting Information, were obtained using ClassyFire [56]. Fatty acyls and carboxylic acids

357

were the most represented classes of compound, with benzenes/benzene derivatives and

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

358

organooxygens as the joint third most represented. Many of the benzenes and benzene derivatives

359

are notable since they are common in exogenous processes, such as petroleum use, plastics

360

production and in pesticide production. Previous studies have put an emphasis on identification of

361

certain chemicals that come from specific pollutant sources. Sources most often include food

362

additives, pesticides [57,58], pharmaceutical drugs, plasticizers [59], PFAS [60], surfactants, flame

363

retardants and cosmetics. Even semen analysis studies marketed as non-targeted tended to focus

364

important findings to chemicals within these classes [21]. Figure 8 includes level 1 and level 2

365

identified compounds and processes that commonly produce CECs. The chemicals included in

366

Figure 8A are all chemicals identified in the study, not necessarily those new to the exposome or

367

associated with semen health outcomes. Figure 8B includes only compounds that were identified

368

as new to the human exposome when compared to the Blood Exposome Database [47]. The

369

common categories in literature are included as sources of interest, along with a few additions.

370

Persistent and mobile compounds are compounds that tend to be prevalent consistently in the

371

environment, whether this is because of their fast transport and mobility or difficulty in breaking

372

them down. Airborne exhaust was added based on the results observed in Table 4 and the

373

likelihood of traffic-related air pollution exposure in samples. Consumer products and high

374

production volume chemicals are of interest based on the number of available chemicals in each

375

category. They have also been included in past non-targeted exposomic studies [61]. The category

376

“Other” encompasses chemicals which have unknown uses or do not fit into the categories

377

previously listed. Unknown uses can stem from proprietary materials in industry, pesticide or

378

consumer product production [43,62]. Sources were queried using the list search function of the

379

CompTox database [46]. Since there is no chemical or metabolomic database specific to semen,

380

the Blood Exposome Database [47] was used to determine if a chemical had been previously

381

reported in human exposure studies. The chemical sources and the cumulative number of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

382

chemicals have a similar profile to other chemical suspect screening papers, such as Wang et al,

383

2021 [61], who had nine categories of compounds identified using the 2021 version of the CompTox

384

Database list search.

that were not previously reported are indicated.

392

Like most biological processes, fertility is intricate and requires many considerations. The decline

393

in global fertility rates in recent years cannot entirely be placed on biological factors [11,12,13].

394

Environmental factors’ impact on fertility cannot be underestimated. A notable relationship has

395

previously been shown between poor semen health and fuel-burning air pollution, with PM2.5, PM10,

396

SO2, NO2 and PAH having the most consistent associations [63,64,65]. The pathway enrichment

397

results in our study indicated traffic-related air pollution was by far the most impactful exposure

398

pathway. This could suggest one of three scenarios: that the metabolites detected and identified in

399

this study act as biomarkers for pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and PAH; that the

400

metabolites found and identified in this study are the real cause, with PM 2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and

401

PAH also present; or, the most likely scenario, that a combination of the metabolites found and the

402

consistent associations in literature are both contributing. Future studies could be done to

403

compare the effects of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and PAH in isolation compared to the pathways

404

observed in this study.

405

Many of the chemicals identified in this study were consistent with those found in the few previous

406

non-targeted semen studies. Sánchez-Resino et al, 2023 [21] notably identified caffeine,

407

theophylline, several PFAS compounds, butyl-phthalates, and tributylamine. Both our study and

408

theirs found pesticides, though different types of pesticides. This could be a result of the human

409

geography of each of the studies, with our sample population coming from New York City and theirs

410

coming from the LED-FERTYL program, based in Europe. Sánchez-Resino et al, 2023 had a

411

particular focus on identifying the presence of their contaminants of note, with detection frequency

412

as a defining characteristic in seminal plasma, whereas our study attempted to make associations

413

between the chemicals found and specific health outcomes.

414

Standards were prepared (Table S1) for confirmation of 66 compounds identified at level 2 or level

415

3. Details of the successful level 1 identifications are included in Spreadsheet S7 in the Supporting

416

Information. Of the 33 that were subsequently identified as level 1, none were associated with

417

semen health outcomes at the BH cutoff point. Four compounds did, however, have an association

418

of p < 0.05 between case and control samples, with one overlap between health parameters (Table

419

2). No level 1 chemicals were associated with low concentration. The two associated with motility

420

were dibutyl phthalate and 2-aminophenol. Dibutyl phthalate is a known endocrine disruptor [66],

421

while 2-aminophenol is a cosmetic compound that has been linked to the metabolism of bisphenol

422

F [67]. The two level 1-confidence chemicals associated with morphology were 4-nitrophenol and

423

palmitic acid. Palmitic acid was also the lone level 1 chemical associated with low semen volume.

424

4-nitrophenol has been previously identified as an irritant, with prolonged exposure causing issues

425

with blood-oxygen transport [68,69]. Palmitic acid is a common saturated fatty acid, the imbalance

426

of which in the body can cause atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer [70].

427

No compounds (identified or otherwise) produced a definitive association with any semen health

428

outcome to the stringent level of BH cutoff. Many chemicals, however, were identified as having p ≤

429

0.005 when t-tested for significance with individual outcomes. Chung et al, 2019, a targeted GC-

430

HRMS study looking for relationships between halogenated chemicals and health outcomes, were

431

able to find similar limited associations that did not meet their correction cutoff (Bonferroni [71]

432

rather than BH) for four types of PCB, two PFOSAs, and one PBDE [22].

433

Another major aim of this study was to identify health-related associations of chemicals novel to

434

the human metabolome. The four previously unreported chemicals that have associations with

435

semen health outcomes are compounds identified based on their InChiKey and IUPAC name. The

436

results described in Table 3 and Figure 3 indicate that the cosmetic additive 3-hydroxyoctanedioic

437

acid was a plausibly identified novel contributor to variance between cases and controls.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hdgr5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-5859 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

438

This study’s strengths are in its approach to building combined associations between chemicals

439

and semen health parameters and its breakdown of individual chemical contributions to trends.

440

This study also does not rely on donors from fertility clinics and databases, but instead volunteers

441

from the general population, providing a more representative set of samples for New York City. The

442

unsupervised non-targeted analysis allows for the highlighting of previously under-reported

443

compounds and their unbiased associations with semen health parameters. Many other studies on

444

the impact of emerging chemicals have focused on groups of suspect compounds and their

445

potential impact on human biological systems [22,36]. In the case of this study, it allowed for the

446

uncovering of eighteen previously unreported chemicals. The use of multiple metrics of

447

association (i.e. PCA, exposure enrichment analysis) also allows for a greater number of avenues

448

and conclusions to be made when reviewing study data.

449

The first major limitation of the study is the small sample size (n = 45), with a relatively small

450

number of “unhealthy” participants. Sperm concentration in particular had n = 4 case

451

measurements that likely made a notable impact on the results for variance described in Figure4A.

452

Other semen studies typically use sample sets in the hundreds from fertility clinic donors and

453

programs such as LED-FERTYL [72,20]. A larger sample size that still utilized the general population

454

donors of this study would have built more confidence in results and may have provided more

455

definitive associations between chemicals of interest and health parameters. A second limitation

456

is the lack of quantitative information. Though HRMS is a valuable resource for identification and

457

measurement of intensity of chemicals, the non-targeted nature of the analysis made acquisition

458

of standards for calibration and quantification of all chemicals of interest challenging. All results

459

are therefore relative, leaving out information about seminal and environmental concentrations.

460

Knowledge of concentrations could provide insight to further classify chemicals and at which

461

levels they begin to impact semen health.

462

The main goal of future work would be to utilize a much larger sample population (1000+

463

individuals) to provide definitive associations between chemicals and semen health outcomes, as

464

per the recommendations by Chung et al, 2019 [22]. Future health outcomes would also aim to use

465

other sample types, such as hair and urine samples as proxies to better understand the differences

466

between the blood-prostate barrier and other blood barriers in the body, such as the blood-kidney

467

barrier (urine) [73,74,75]. This information would also help to contextualize contaminants by

468

showing their prevalence throughout the body’s different media. Future studies would also aim to

469

quantify chemical concentrations associated with health outcomes to help determine the levels in

470

the body and environment at which infertility starts to become impacted.

471

5 Conclusions

472

Non-targeted analysis of semen and urine samples among men in the New York City area revealed

473

over 7000 uniquely identified features. Eighteen compounds appear new to the human exposome

474

when compared with the Blood Exposome Database. One of these eighteen chemicals, 3-

475

hydroxyoctanedioic acid, was positively identified through literature spectra and had notable

476

associations with low motility and morphology. Four level 1 identified compounds also had

477

associations with semen health parameters: dibutyl phthalate and 2-aminophenol negatively

478

impacted motility, 4-nitrophenol was associated with low morphology, while palmitic acid was

479

found to be associated with both low morphology and low volume.

480

The collective relationship between the chemicals observed in the study and semen health

481

parameters provide insights into the overall association between male fertility and the exposome.

482

Though there were no single chemicals that met the minimum BH threshold for statistical

483

significance, collective PCA analysis of all chemicals with a p < 0.05 relationship with each semen

484

health parameter yielded moderate trends separating unhealthy participants from control

485

participants. Exposure enrichment analysis was used to understand the environmental sources

486

that may have influenced sperm quality. The compounds most closely related to semen health

487

outcomes yielded a notable relationship between unhealthy semen and exposure pathways

488

related to vehicle exhaust air pollution, with p-values of 3.03×10-4, 2.34×10-5 and 5.73×10-4 for

489

concentration, motility and volume, respectively.
