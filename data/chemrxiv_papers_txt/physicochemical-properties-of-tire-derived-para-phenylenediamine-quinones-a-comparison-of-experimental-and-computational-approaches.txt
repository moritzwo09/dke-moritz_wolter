Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) compounds are added to tire rubber at percent levels to sacrificially react
with oxidants for prolonged service life. Recently, the PPD transformation product N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ) has been identified in roadway runoff as a potent
toxicant for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). As 6PPD may be phased out in favour of alternative
PPDs, understanding the physicochemical properties of their corresponding quinones is important for
predicting their environmental fate, distribution, and toxicity. Here, we present experimentally
determined water solubility values for 6PPDQ and five structural analogues and find them to be several
orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by EPI Suite, a popular Quantitative Structure Activity
Relationship (QSAR) program. We also report octanol-water and air-water partition coefficients for PPDQs
using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and QSAR approaches. Both methods provided similar rank
ordering of compounds. However, DFT methods tended to underestimate log Kow values and overestimate
log Kaw values relative to EPI Suite. We discuss the strengths and limitations of both computational
approaches, the need for more experimentally derived values, and caution researchers interpreting
predicted physicochemical properties, particularly for emerging contaminants for which QSARs may be
poorly parameterized.

Tire wear particles have been identified as a source of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-pphenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ), which leads to Urban Runoff Mortality Syndrome in salmonid
species. Characterizing the physicochemical properties of 6PPDQ and structurally related paraphenylenediamine quinone analogues (PPDQs) is crucial in understanding their environmental fate,
distribution, and consequent risks towards aquatic organisms. Computational methods can provide
important insight into intrinsic molecular properties, especially where compounds are unavailable in
sufficient quantity and/or purity to carry out experimental measurements. This paper presents
experimental water solubilities and evaluates several computational methods applied to PPDQs of

Introduction
In 2021, Tian et al. identified N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone
(6PPDQ) as the cause of rain driven mass die-off events of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the
Pacific Northwest – a phenomenon known as Urban Runoff Mortality Syndrome (URMS).1 Paraphenylenediamine quinones (PPDQs) are derived from the ozonation of para-phenylenediamines (PPDs),
sacrificial antiozonants added at 0.4–2 wt% to tire rubber to extend their use.1 6PPDQ and structurally
related PPDQ analogues have been observed to enter urban waterways and have been quantified in road
dust, sediments, snowmelt, fish tissues, and other matrices.2–8 6PPDQ toxicity has been established for
other salmonid species, including brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis),9–11 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss),9,10 and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush),12 but coho salmon appear to be the most susceptible
with LC50 values ranging from 41–95 ng/L.13,14 6PPDQ appears to exhibit stereoselective toxicity, as the S
enantiomer was recently reported to be 2.6 times more toxic to coho salmon than the R enantiomer.9,15
The 2024 U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association Preliminary (Stage 1) Alternatives Analysis Report proposes
several alternatives to 6PPD,16 including structural analogs where alkyl/aryl groups (R1 and R2) are varied
(Figure 1 and Figure S1). However, the physicochemical properties of 6PPDQ and related analogs remain
largely unreported.

The physicochemical properties of a contaminant govern its environmental fate and distribution
behaviour, including physical, chemical, and biological processes.17 Characterization of these intrinsic
properties enables more accurate multi-phase models thus improving our understanding of the impact of
environmental contaminants.18 Knowledge of these properties also informs appropriate sample handling
in both the field and the lab. For example, recent studies have demonstrated that 6PPDQ sorbs to
hydrophobic plastic laboratory materials and is lost from aqueous samples open to the atmosphere.4,19,20
Understanding these loss processes is critical in developing good laboratory practices for analytical
determinations and has important implications for exposure and toxicity studies.
Of particular interest for PPDQs is their water solubility, a property which gives an upper bound
to their ability to leach from tire wear particles into the aquatic environment and contributes to both the
air-water (Kaw) and octanol-water (Kow) partition coefficients. Compounds with low water solubility such
as 6PPDQ19 pose a challenge when constructing aqueous standards or designing toxicity studies, especially
if the solubility limits are exceeded. Various structural and thermodynamic factors influence water
solubility including the strength of the solvent-solute interactions and the partial molar volume of the
compound, both of which affect the energetics of cavity formation in water. Water solubility can be
measured in several ways, but generally involves measuring the concentration of the solute in a saturated
solution of fixed composition and temperature.17 Complicating the measurement of aqueous solubility,
sparingly soluble hydrophobic compounds can be slow to dissolve into water from their pure solid or liquid
form, have a tendency to partition to container walls as well as the air-water interface, and may in some
cases self-aggregate into dimers, micelles and other lamellar structures.21
Additional challenges in experimentally measuring physicochemical properties of emerging
contaminants may arise due to cost (time, personnel, instrumentation), toxicity concerns, and low
availability of pure standards. The latter concern is particularly relevant for transformation products such
as PPDQs,19,22 as not all quinone products of proposed PPD alternatives are commercially available and

those that are may be prohibitively expensive. In such circumstances, physicochemical properties may be
predicted using a variety of computational tools. A common approach is Quantitative Structure Activity
Relationship (QSAR) models, such as EPI Suite.23 QSAR modelling involves comparing structural moieties
of the target compound to a training set of compounds with well-characterized physicochemical
properties to generate predicted properties. As such, the predictive model is most accurate when the
target compound is structurally similar to the training set, which can limit the accuracy of predictions for
complex molecules or unusual structural moieties like those found in PPDQs. EPI Suite in particular uses
two dimensional SMILES codes as input, so cannot account for variation introduced by chiral centres,
protonation states, or pH effects.24,25 Predicted properties of PPDQs have previously been reported by
Klockner et al. (2021), Cao et al. (2022), and Zeng et al. (2023) using QSARs methods,26–28 however the
accuracy of these values has not been evaluated. Given the structural complexity of PPDQs and the
relative novelty of the electron distribution in phenylenediamine quinones, it is unclear if the available
training data in EPI Suite and other QSAR models yield accurate predictions for PPDQs. This led us to
consider density functional theory (DFT) as an alternative computational approach to evaluate PPDQs.
Unlike QSAR models, DFT methods are not based on experimentally derived properties. Instead, they use
quantum mechanics to calculate the electronic structure of a molecule from first principles, which is then
used to compute the desired property.29,30 As DFT does not rely on empirical data, properties calculated
using this method may be more accurate for molecules with novel moieties that are not well
parameterized.31 However, relative to QSAR approaches, DFT calculations are computationally expensive
and can require several days of run time on a supercomputer. Simplifying assumptions about the system
such as the use of a dielectric continuum to represent the solvent rather than the use of discrete solvent
molecules can reduce the run time.32,33 Regardless of the computational approach, experimentallyderived results are needed to validate the accuracy of predicated properties and inform simplifying
assumptions.

Hu et al. recently reported the log Kow and water solubility of 6PPDQ to be 4.30 ± 0.02 and 38 ± 10
μg L-1, respectively.19 Interestingly, EPI Suite predicts a similar log Kow (3.98) but a water solubility value
over three orders of magnitude greater at 56.9 mg L-1.27 This discrepancy, along with the general lack of
physicochemical property information available for the PPDQ structural analogs, prompted us to examine
this further. Here, we compare water solubility predictions made by EPI Suite for six PPDQs to
experimental values made by directly measuring their free concentration in aqueous solution using
condensed phase membrane induction mass spectrometry (CP-MIMS).34 Additionally, we evaluate the
suitability of DFT methods relative to QSARs for the calculation of the environmentally relevant partition
coefficients Kow and Kaw.

Experimental Materials and Methods
Experimental Materials
Deionized water (18 MΩ-cm, Facility Scale Reverse Osmosis/Ion Exchange Water Purification
System, Applied Membranes Inc., Vista, CA, USA) was used to prepare analytical standards. HPLC-grade
solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON). 6PPDQ, 6PPDQ-d5, IPPDQ, 77PDQ, DTPDQ,
DPPDQ, and CPPDQ were obtained from HPC Standards Inc (>92% purity, Atlanta, GA, USA). 13C6-6PPDQ
was purchased from ACP Chemicals (Montreal, QC, CAN).
Water Solubility
The aqueous phase concentrations of PPDQs were monitored in real-time using a semi-permeable
membrane immersion probe mounted into a Teflon-backed cap screwed onto the sample vial. This
approach, termed condensed phase membrane introduction mass spectrometry (CP-MIMS), has been
described previously.4 Here, the probe consisted of an 8.0 cm long, 170 μm thick (0.30 mm ID, 0.64 mm
OD) hollow fibre polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane (Silastic brand, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA)

mounted onto 22-gauge stainless-steel hypodermic tubing. The acceptor phase was a 15/85 (v/v)
heptane/methanol solution containing 20 µg kg-1 13C6-6PPDQ internal standard (IS) acidified with 0.03%
formic acid (Fisher Chemical, Ottawa, ON). Acceptor phase was continuously delivered at 10 μL min-1 via
syringe pump (Chemyx Fusion 100, Stafford, TX, USA) with a 10 mL gas-tight syringe (Hamilton 1000 series,
Fisher Scientific) to an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Analysis was conducted using positive mode
ESI coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-MS/MS; Perkin-Elmer QSightTM 220, Waltham,
MA, USA). Instrument parameters and MS/MS transitions are listed in Table S1. Water solubility was
determined by monitoring changes in the IS-normalized MS/MS signal intensity in response to sequential
spike additions of an analytical standard solution of individual PPDQs. Each spike addition was followed
by a 10-minute stabilization period in a continuously-stirred, temperature-controlled solution at 25 ± 1 °C
for all six PPDQs, with additional experiments at 11 ± 1 and 41 ± 1 °C for 6PPDQ. The internal standard
corrected signal intensity is plotted over time (Figure 2) and the solubility was determined using the
intersection of the best-fit lines derived from the linear dynamic calibration range and data points in a
saturated solution. Solubility experiments were performed in triplicate for 6PPDQ with 13–16 spike
additions of 30. μL of 6.9 mg L-1 6PPDQ sub-stock (in acetonitrile) into 37.0 mL of DI water (pH ~ 5.5). This
resulted in a final co-solvent concentration of 0.1% v/v. A control experiment evaluating the solubility of
6PPDQ at elevated co-solvent concentration (2% v/v) showed no significant change to the observed
solubility (Figure S2). Temperatures were controlled with a recirculating chiller (2095 Bath and Circulator,
Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH, USA) to remain at 25.4 ± 0.2 °C. A sample vial was placed inside a doublewalled beaker, and water from the chiller was circulated through the outer layer. The water temperature
inside the beaker, equilibrated with the sample, was measured with a digital thermometer. The solubility
of the PPDQ analogues were examined using 10. μL spikes of stock solution (in methanol: 1.77 mg L -1
DTPDQ, 54.4 mg L-1 IPPDQ, 22.1 mg L-1 CPPDQ, 2.88 mg L-1 77PDQ, and acetonitrile: 39.4 mg L-1 DPPDQ).

Uncertainties were determined from the standard deviation of n = 3 experimental replicates for 6PPDQ
and from six different line fits for a single experiment the remaining PPDQs, as illustrated in Figure S3.
Liquid Chromatography and Log Kow
Aqueous solubility for 6PPD, 6PPDQ, and DTPDQ were also analyzed using a more conventional
analytical workflow involving liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of filtered, aqueous solutions. A
series of solutions were prepared by spiking increasing volumes of a methanolic standard (280 mg L -1
6PPD, 4.7 mg L-1 6PPDQ, 4.9 mg L-1 DTPDQ) into 40 mL vials containing deionized water with 300 ng L-1
6PPDQ-d5 acting as an internal standard (maximum methanol co-solvent ca. 2% v/v). Aqueous solutions
were equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes before filtration through a 0.45 µm Acrodisc Nylon
filter (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA) via a 50 mL glass syringe. Heptane (1.0 mL) was added
to the aqueous filtrate, and the solution was then shaken for 30 seconds and allowed to fully separate. A
500. µL aliquot of the heptane layer was taken for HPLC-MS analysis with a Thermo Fisher Vanquish MD
HPLC connected to a TSQ Fortis. A YMC Triart C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 3 µm; Chromatographic
Specialties, Brockville, ON, CAN) was used at 35 °C. Sample injections were 2.00 μL into an isocratic 0.200
mL min-1 flow of 0.1% v/v formic acid in methanol. The same m/z transitions described above (Table S1)
were employed, with additional mass spectrometer settings listed in the table footnote. Chromatographic
peak areas normalized to the internal standard were plotted against the added concentration.
The Kow for 6PPDQ was determined following the method of Hu et al. with minor modifications,
including 30 minutes of equilibration in an ultrasonic bath and separation via centrifugation at 2500 RPM
for 60 minutes.19 Quantitation of 6PPDQ in the aqueous and n-octanol phase was determined by HPLC–
MS/MS using solvent matched calibration standards ranging from 0.5–12 µg L-1 and 0.6–48 µg L-1,
respectively. To aid in the discussion of computational Kow values for the structurally related PPDQ series,
we obtained isocratic retention times with 25/75 (v/v) water/methanol eluent with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
(Figure S4, Table S2).

Computational Methods - EPI Suite
The Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite (v4.11) provided by the US EPA predicts
physicochemical properties using the two-dimensional SMILES code of a compound and quantitative
structure activity relationships (QSARs).23 Programs within EPI Suite use either a bond contribution or a
group contribution method, wherein a molecule is divided into a set of covalent bonds or groups of atoms,
each of which have been parameterized with a contribution towards a given physicochemical property
based on experimental data. The predicted property is therefore the sum of the contributions from each
bond or group, plus correction factors. The KOWWIN Program (v1.68) was used to predict log Kow values
with the group contribution method. The bond contribution method in the HENRYWIN Program (v3.20)
predicted Henry’s law constants at 25◦C in Pa∙m3 mol-1 which were converted to Kaw values via the ideal
gas law (Eqn. S1). The HENRYWIN group contribution method did not output a prediction for the PPDQs
as it is missing a value for the secondary amine. Water solubility (CWsat) was calculated from Kow with
WSKOWWIN (v1.42) using equation S2 and from the group contribution method with WATERNT (v1.01).
Computational Methods - Density functional theory
DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 16 (revision c.01)35 with the ωB97XD exchangecorrelation functional and the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Molecular geometries of 6PPD, 6PPDQ and its
analogues were optimized, and the Gibbs energy of each molecule was calculated in the gas phase as well
as in implicit water and n-octanol using the SMD solvation model.33 Gibbs energies of solvated systems
Gsolv were calculated using Eqn. 1, where Ggas is the Gibbs energy obtained in the gas phase, Egas(el) and
Esolv(el) are the electronic energy calculated in the gas phase and in implicit solvent respectively, and RT
ln (24.46) is a correction factor that accounts a change of reference state from po = 1 bar in the gas phase
to co = 1 M in solution.

For Kaw calculations, Ggas was taken directly from Gaussian output with no additional calculation necessary.
The Kow and Kaw were calculated using Eqn. 2 where ΔG is the Gibbs energy difference for the transition
from water to either n-octanol or gas phase, R is the gas constant, and T is 298 K.

Estimation of Partial Molar Volumes
Partial molar volumes of PPDQs were calculated using the Archimedean Displacement Model,38,39
a molecular-dynamics based method for accurate determinations of molecular volumes. In this technique,
classical force fields are used to represent intra- and inter-molecular interactions, which allows for explicit
solvent molecules to be included in the calculation. The partial molar volume of a solute surrounded by N
explicit solvent molecules is determined by the amount of displaced volume relative to the pure N-solvent
system when a single molecule of solute is added. Simulations were performed using GROMACS 2023 and
the OPLS/AA force field,38-41 in a cubic periodic box containing about 2000 solvent molecules and one
solute. Temperature was maintained at 298 K with the velocity-rescale thermostat (τT = 0.1 ps)36 and
pressure was maintained at 1 bar with the C-rescale barostat (τP = 2.0 ps).37

Results & Discussion
Water solubility
To determine the water solubility of 6PPDQ and its analogs, we employed a semi-permeable
membrane immersion probe to directly measure the free aqueous phase concentration in situ. This
approach was demonstrated previously by Termopoli et al.,38 showing excellent agreement between
experimental and literature values for the water solubility of pyrene at 135 μg L -1. Figure 2A shows an
example chronogram representing the internal standard-normalized MS/MS signal for 6PPDQ over time
as consecutive spike additions were added to the aqueous solution. Figure 2B displays the resulting data
wherein the signal is plotted against the added concentration. The intersection of the linear portion of the

calibration curve (below the solubility limit, black data points) and the data points clearly above the
solubility limit (red data points) corresponds to the solubility limit. Using this approach, we determined
the water solubility of 6PPDQ at 25 °C as 31 ± 5 μg L-1 which is in excellent agreement with the reported
literature value (38 ± 10 μg L-1).19 We observed that the solubility of 6PPDQ was relatively invariant with
temperature ranging from 29 ± 4 (n=3) to 42 ± 6 (n=3) μg L-1 between 11 and 41 °C (example plots given
in Figure S5).

The experimental solubilities of PPDQ analogues are presented in Figure S6 and summarized in Table 1.
The water solubility varies across this series with roughly a 50-fold difference between DPPDQ (168 μg L-

) and DTPDQ (3.5 μg L-1). In general, smaller PPDQs, such as IPPDQ and DPPDQ, exhibit higher water

solubilities (> 100 μg L-1), whereas the larger DTPDQ and 77PDQ are considerably less water soluble (< 10
μg L-1). 6PPDQ and CPPDQ exhibit intermediate solubilities at 31 and 32 μg L-1, respectively.

* Literature value for 6PPDQ has been reported to be 38 ± 10 μg L-1 following EPA guidelines with minor modifications at 20°C and

67 ± 5 μg L-1 at 23°C using a solid/liquid saturator system method.19,39 Experimental CP-MIMS result for 6PPDQ is reported as the
mean and standard deviation of n=3 experiments. All other PPDQ results are based on the mean and standard deviation of three
linear fits choosing different points to as below and above solubility for a single experiment. Error on the partial molar volume
calculations is estimated using block averaging.40
**Recalibrated according to an updated correction term (C=-2.207) in Equation S2 determined from the experimental solubility
for 6PPDQ reported here and the EPISuite predicted log Kow available in Table 2.

The observed differences in solubility for the PPDQ analogues are consistent with the expected
trend based on their partial molar volumes in water as estimated using the Archimedean Displacement
Method (Figure 3).41–44 The larger an organic contaminant is, the more water-water solvent interactions
are disrupted to create a hydrophobic cavity the compound will occupy. This process raises the chemical
potential of the solution, consequently reducing the aqueous solubility.17 As expected for a structurally

related series, a linear free energy relationship was observed between aqueous solubility and estimated
partial molar volume, with the exception of DTPDQ which exhibited a low water solubility (3.5 ± 0.3 μg L1

) for its size. Interestingly, the coefficient of determination for the six PPDQs (R2 = 0.57) improved to 0.90

with the exclusion of DTPDQ (Figure 3). It is worth noting that both DPPDQ and DTPDQ are unique in the
PPDQ series as having aryl substituents on both nitrogen atoms, potentially affecting their acid/base
characteristics via electron delocalization. While beyond the scope of this work, this may lead to
consequential pH-dependent solubility for these compounds.

Figure 3. Linear free energy relationship plotting experimental log (Cwsat) from CP-MIMS experiment against
calculated partial molar volume using the Archimedean Displacement Method. The red best-fit line includes
DTPDQ (R2 = 0.57) while the black best-fit line excludes it (R2 = 0.90). Experimental solubilities of 6PPDQ (blue) and
DTPDQ (red) determined using an off-line filtration and LC-MS method are illustrated with stripes and are included
as a reference (not used in either regression line).

The water solubility of DTPDQ was also measured by preparing a series of aqueous solutions of
increasing amounts of DTPDQ, passing them through a 0.45 µm filter, and measuring the resulting
concentrations off-line by conventional LC-MS/MS. The solubility of DTPDQ with this approach was
determined to be 11 ± 2 μg L-1. While somewhat higher than that measured directly in solution by CP-

MIMS it is still well below the trendline in Figure 3. The solubility of 6PPDQ measured by this method (41
± 3 μg L-1, Table S3), was in better agreement with the direct CP-MIMS method and also within
experimental error of the published value from Hu et al.19 The in-situ CP-MIMS data may be revealing
solution phase behaviour. In the limit of low concentration, there is a linear dynamic range regime below
10 μg L-1 consistent with employing this technique for trace level quantitative 6PPDQ determinations.4,45
However, at concentrations approaching the saturation limit, the measured free concentration in solution
appears to level off gradually (Figure 2; green coloured datapoints). This behaviour suggests some form
of self-aggregation at higher concentrations, and appears to be more pronounced for some PPDQs, such
as 77PDQ and IPPDQ (Figure S6). Hu et al. noted that 6PPDQ can form aggregates based on intermolecular
hydrogen bonding and - stacking interactions.19,46 Further computational studies are currently
underway to model the energetics of intermolecular interactions of 6PPDQ and structural analogs. In any
case, it is worth noting that conventional solubility measurements based on physical separation of
dissolved and undissolved phases (i.e., filtration or centrifugation) have the potential to overestimate the
solubility of aggregate-forming analytes.
While it remains unclear if all PPDQs are acutely toxic to aquatic organisms, it is clear that they
are soluble in water at levels exceeding the LC50 of 6PPDQ for coho by several orders of magnitude.13,14
Additionally, 6PPDQ is considerably less water soluble than the parent compound 6PPD (0.6–2 mg L-1),39,47
which has likely confounded early toxicity studies reporting experimental designs with concentration
levels exceeding the solubility limits reported here.48 The EPI Suite predicted water solubilities using
WSKOWWIN and WATERNT are also included in Table 1. Interestingly, the predicted values are 2–4 orders
of magnitude larger than the experimental water solubility reported here and elsewhere.19,39 Additionally,
the predicted water solubilities do not follow the same rank-order trend observed in the experimental
results. The accuracy of QSAR methods like WSKOWWIN and WATERNT depend heavily on the similarity
of the test molecule to the training set. This training set is publicly available through the most recent

version of the EPI Suite web app (https://episuite.dev/EpiWebSuite/#/) and users are able to view if the
database has any structural analogs for a test molecule by using the Analog Identification Methodology
(AIM) function. However, there are no analogs for 6PPDQ in the training set at this time. EPI Suite
predictions have been found to closely match experimental data for more common compounds like
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monoterpenoids,49,50 but it is known to deviate from experimental
results for more complex structures and novel functional groups.51–55
One of the notable characteristics of 6PPDQ is the unusually low basicity of the amine groups,
presumably due to the extensive conjugation and electron withdrawing power of the quinone carbonyls.
This was first noted in the description of the synthesis of 6PPDQ by Tian et al., where it remained in the
organic phase after a wash with 0.1 M HCl to remove more basic impurities.1 Whereas most organic
amines are expected to be protonated under ambient pH conditions and thus more water soluble, this is
not the case for 6PPDQ. The EPI Suite QSAR methods may therefore use parameters fitted to reproduce
the solubility of compounds with protonated amines, resulting in a significant overestimation of the water
solubility of PPDQs. This assertion is supported by the observation that replacing the amines in 6PPDQ
with alkane groups in EPI Suite, which would have a similar molar volume but not have parameters that
are biased towards protonation, results in a solubility prediction that is 3-4 orders of magnitude closer to
the experimental result (130.3 μg/L with WSKOWWIN and 42.9 μg/L with WATERNT). The WSKOWWIN
method uses a linear free energy method to predict solubility based on the compound’s log Kow and molar
mass (Eq. S2) and is therefore more convenient to reparametrize than the fragment-based WATERNT
method. We re-fitted the correction term C = 1.008 in Eq. S2 to our experimental solubility and the QSAR
predicted log Kow for 6PPDQ (Table 2) and obtained a new value of C’ = -2.207, which was used to predict
the water solubilities for the remaining analogs. The results, shown in Table 1, are significantly improved
over the WSKOWWIN predictions with the original parameters. Therefore, the relatively high
hydrophobicity and low basicity of the PPDQs combined with the paucity of experimental data for the
15

unique enamine quinone structure may explain the poor predictive performance of EPI Suite solubilities
for this family of compounds. Therefore, we recommend caution when using this QSAR method for
compounds such as PPDQs which are not well-represented by the training set. Additional factors that may
give rise to an overestimation of the PPDQ water solubilities by QSAR methods may include water
solubility training set data being biased towards compounds with high water solubilities because of
historical limitations of analytical measurement sensitivity for hydrophobic organic molecules and/or
experimental methods that do not adequately separate molecular clusters from the free aqueous phase
compounds.56 Notably, when the WSKOWWIN method was calculated using Eq. S2 with the original
correction term C and the molecular weight of a 6PPDQ dimer, rather than that of a single molecule, the
result was closer to experimental findings (6.9 × 102 μg L-1 instead of 5.1 × 104 μg L-1, Table 1). We were
not able to acquire DFT-based water solubilities due to the lattice energies for these compounds, which
is required for such calculations, currently being unknown.
Octanol – Water Partitioning
The octanol-water partition coefficients were calculated using both QSAR (EPI Suite) and DFT
(Gaussian) approaches, summarized in Table 2. The predicted Kow values for the PPDQs follow the same
rank order by both methods with the KOWWIN values (EPI Suite) being roughly 5 to 10-fold higher. Veith
and others57,58 have employed the correlation between log Kow and log (isocratic retention times) for a
structurally related series of compounds to model octanol-water partitioning behaviour. Figure 4 displays
this linear free energy relationship for the PPDQ series using our experimental retention times and the
predicted log Kow values from DFT and QSAR. The log Kow value of 3.98 predicted by EPI Suite’s KOWWIN
for 6PPDQ most closely matches our experimental value of 4.0 ± 0.2 as well as that reported earlier by Hu
et al.19 of 4.30 ± 0.02 (both overlaid on Figure 4). KOWWIN has been widely accepted to provide good
predicted log Kow values for neutral compounds.59 The calculation of log Kow is one of the most commonly
reported uses of EPI Suite in the literature.52,55,60–62 The DFT method yields a log Kow of 3.27 for 6PPDQ,

which is roughly an order of magnitude less than the experimental values. This discrepancy may be
explained by the solvent model used. The implicit SMD solvent model, which uses a dielectric continuum
to represent the solvent, has been shown to underestimate log Kow for other compounds.55,63 The use of
dielectric constants for dry n-octanol has been shown to yield more accurate results for DFT predictions;63
however, changing the dielectric here only marginally improved the log Kow result to 3.31. It is important
to note that the SMD implicit solvent model does not account for specific solvent-solute interactions such
as hydrogen bonding, so inclusion of some explicit solvent molecules around the solute may improve the
DFT prediction. However, this would also significantly increase the computational cost of the calculation.
Based on the results presented here, we recommend the KOWWIN from EPI Suite for PPDQ analogs.

log Kow values are denoted with a (+) for DFT calculated values and (x) for QSAR predicted values. Experimental log
Kow values for 6PPDQ are superimposed in solid blue for the results reported here (circle) and previously by Hu et
al. (square).19

The predicted log Kow values for the PPDQ analogs examined here range from 2.58 to 5.47, which
indicates partitioning into organic matter and biological systems is likely, and is consistent with previous
observations of PPDQs in soil/sediment phases.2,27 While a number of factors such as aquatic toxicity and

environmental persistence need to be considered, the relatively high bioaccumulation potential (log Kow
> 3) of many PPDQs poses a significant environmental risk.

Air-Water Partitioning
Understanding the air-water partitioning behaviour of PPDQs is important in predicting their
environmental distribution and in particular their ability to undergo gas-phase atmospheric transport. A
marked decrease in the aqueous concentration of PPDQs when left in open containers exposed to the
atmosphere (t1/2 ~ 14–108 hrs)4 has been observed by us and others,2,4 suggesting that air/water-interface
partitioning or some other loss process (e.g., reaction with an atmospheric component) may be occurring.
To probe this further, we have calculated the log Kaw using both QSAR (EPI Suite HENRYWIN) and DFT
methods. To our knowledge, there are currently no experimental results available for the PPDQs.
Therefore, seven test compounds with experimental results reported in Abraham et al. (2019) were used
to test these predictive models.64 These test compounds were selected for their structural similarities to

18

PPDQs and have experimental log Kaw results between -8.57 and -2.42 (Table S4). Figure S7 plots predicted
versus experimental log Kaw values using both DFT and EPI Suite methods. The results indicate better
agreement between experimental values and predicted values obtained with DFT calculations (slope =
1.04, R2 = 0.89) versus EPI Suite (slope = 0.73, R2 = 0.65). As seen in Table 2, the HENRYWIN predictions
underestimate Kaw by 2–4 orders of magnitude relative to DFT for the PPDQs, consistent with the variance
observed in the water solubility values. Furthermore, the DFT predictions for 6PPDQ agree with
COSMOtherm predictions, which calculated the log Kaw to be -8.28.65 The increased performance of DFT
relative to EPI Suite in this case may be due to the accuracy of DFT at describing molecules in the gas
phase, combined with the lack of similarity of the PPDQs to the molecules in the training sets used by
QSAR methods like HENRYWIN. Therefore, we recommend the use DFT rather than QSAR methods for the
prediction of log Kaw.
The DFT calculated log Kaw values for the PPDQs reported in Table 2 range from -7.2 for 77PDQ to
-8.9 for DTPDQ with 6PPDQ predicted to be -8.0. For context, these values are considerably lower than
pollutants observed to exhibit long range atmospheric transport, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (-2 to
-3), and are in a similar range to atrazine (-6.9) and carbaryl (-7.7)17 which are not. As such, PPDQs are not
expected to readily partition from water into the gas phase. It remains unclear what process is responsible
for the decrease in aqueous concentrations of PPDQs in open containers. To date we have not observed
any direct evidence of gas phase PPDQ arising from aqueous solution. While this observation is consistent
with the low predicted Kaw values predicted here, experimentally determined Kaw are a recognized
knowledge gap that may further elucidate the underlying loss mechanism.
Conclusions
Physicochemical properties may be measured through experimentation and predicted with
computational approaches including QSARs and DFT methods. Here, we report experimental water
solubilities for 6PPDQ (31 ± 5 µg L-1) and five structural analogs, ranging from 3.5 ± 0.3 µg L-1 for DTPDQ
19

to 168 ± 8 µg L-1 for DPPDQ. EPI Suite predictions based QSARs methods were 2–5 orders of magnitude
greater than experimental solubility results, potentially due to the anomalously low basicity of the PPDQ
amines which is not represented in the QSAR training set. Re-parameterization of the equation used by
WSKOWWIN significantly improved these predictions. Examining log Kow, we found that EPI Suite
predicted values in close agreement with experimental findings. The KOWWIN predicted log Kow values
ranged from 2.58 for IPPDQ to 5.47 for 77PPDQ, suggesting that they pose a bioaccumulation risk if
persistent. While DFT predicted a similar trend and rank order among the PPDQs investigated here, it
systematically underestimated log Kow, which may be due to the lack of specific solvent-solute interactions
in the DFT model applied. Conversely, we found DFT worked well in predicting air-water partitioning for a
series of test compounds, but as we were unable to detect gas phase concentrations we do not report
experimental Kaw values for PPDQs. DFT predicted low log Kaw values for PPDQs, ranging from -7.2 for
77PDQ to -8.9 for DTPDQ, suggesting that atmospheric transport in the gas phase is unlikely. This work
presents both experimental and computed physicochemical properties for these emerging contaminants.
As computational approaches become increasingly powerful and accessible, we encourage users to
critically evaluate their fitness for specific purposes. An abundance of computational results with
unknown accuracy may prove more hindrance than help if applied inappropriately or used in place of
experimental data.
