Abstract

19

The coastal ocean receives more mercury from riverine input (land-derived Hg) than from direct

20

atmospheric deposition. Land-derived Hg is primarily particle-bound and buried in coastal sediment,

21

where it may undergo methylation. However, its contribution to coastal sediment Hg loads remains

22

poorly constrained.

23

Here, we investigate Hg sources along an estuarine-to-marine gradient in the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic

24

Ocean) combining Hg and carbon (C) stable isotopic composition in sediments. We find a significant

25

(p<0.05) difference in δ202Hg and δ13C between estuarine (δ202Hg -0.83 ± 0.15‰, δ13C -27.3 ± 0.50‰)

26

and marine (δ202Hg -0.54 ± 0.16‰, δ13C -25.2 ± 0.80‰) sediments, and a significant correlation

27

(p<0.05) between δ13C and δ202Hg. While in-situ processes had a negligible impact on Hg isotopic

28

composition, the observed trends could be explained by the mixing of land-derived Hg (e.g.

29

vegetational uptake, anthropogenic) and direct atmospheric deposition to the marine environment.

30

Applying a binary-mixing model with regional endmembers to δ13C and δ202 signatures reveals a near

31

1:1 relationship between land-derived Hg and terrestrial C along our estuarine-to-marine gradient. This

32

relationship, if confirmed for other regions, suggests that joint observations of C stable isotopes and

33

Hg concentrations could directly constrain the transfer of land-derived Hg into coastal sediments.

Synopsis Statement:

We show that Hg and C isotopes are jointly diluted over an estuarine-to-marine gradient which

suggests that C may be used to trace land-derived Hg inputs and fates in coastal marine

1. Introduction

46

Estuarine and coastal zones are highly dynamic transition areas between land and sea, receiving

47

continuous riverine input of nutrients, suspended particulate matter, and trace metals including

48

mercury (Hg). The majority of riverine Hg is associated with particulate organic carbon [1,2] and buried

49

in sediments trough particle settling [3,4]. In sediments, Hg may undergo microbial methylation to

50

form methylated Hg (MeHg) [5,6], a potent neurotoxin, which magnifies along the trophic chain

51

resulting in high exposure levels for fish consuming populations [7–9].

52

For the global coastal ocean, riverine inputsof Hg exceed atmospheric deposition [2]. While reduction

53

of riverine inorganic Hg (Hg(II)) and its evasion to the atmosphere may partially offset the input of

54

terrestrial Hg to the coastal ocean [10], it has been estimated to be of minor importance [2,11,12],

55

likely due to the importance of transient flood events in particle export [2,13].

56

However, these estimates are highly uncertain, as Earth system models lack adequate representation

57

of estuarine and coastal processes [2], and observational data covering the estuarine-to-marine

58

continuum remain scarce [14–17]. In light of the projected increase in river flood events with climate

59

change, which will likely elevate the Hg burden to coastal zones, and the potential for continental shelf

60

regions to hold 3 to 4 times more Hg than previously estimated, it is critical to better constrain the fate

61

of Hg over the estuarine-to-marine continuum [2].

62

Hg strongly binds to reduced sulfur sites in organic matter in aquatic environments [18], influencing its

63

transport, transformations and bioavailability [7,19,20]. In riverine and estuarine systems, most Hg is

64

bound to particles [2,21–24], and this is also observed in the Adour estuary [10,25]. The strong

65

association of Hg with organic C has proven valuable in models constraining riverine Hg export to the

66

ocean [2].

67

Distinct C stable isotopic signatures (δ¹³C) serves as a tracer for C origin and cycling, with terrestrial

68

particulate organic matter typically exhibiting lighter values (i.e. -27‰ to -30‰) and phytoplankton-

69

derived C (marine) showing heavier values (i.e.-20‰ to -25‰) [26].

70

Similarly, stable isotopic composition of Hg can be used constrain sources and/or characterize

71

biogeochemical transformation processes in different matrices, such as marine sediments where Hg is

72

ultimately buried [14,16,17,27–30]. Hg has seven stable isotopes, which undergo mass-dependent

73

(MDF) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) during partial biogeochemical processes, resulting in

74

distinct signatures (δ202Hg, Δ199Hg, Δ200Hg, Δ201Hg, Δ204Hg) that reflect different sources and/or

75

processes [31,32]. While all studied biogeochemical processes [31,32] induce mass dependent

76

fractionation (MDF, δ202Hg), large mass-independent fractionation of odd Hg isotopes (odd-MIF,

77

Δ199Hg, Δ201Hg) is predominantly of photochemical origin [33] due to the magnetic isotope effect (MIE)

78

[34]. Another mechanism inducing odd-MIF, though of smaller magnitude, is the nuclear volume effect

79

(NVE) [35]. In contrast, even-MIF (Δ200Hg, Δ204Hg) is considered a conservative tracer because it is

80

thought to be exclusively generated by photochemical reactions in the upper troposphere and/or

81

stratosphere [36,37]. Atmospheric Hg(0) and Hg(II) in precipitation exhibit distinct Δ200Hg signatures,

82

allowing the differentiation of atmospheric deposition pathways [38].

83

Here we investigate a gradient of surface sediments collected from the upstream Adour river estuary

84

seaward including the initial 23.5 km of the Capbreton canyon (Bay of Biscay, Atlantic). High total Hg

85

concentrations have been reported (> 500 ng g-1) for the Capbreton canyon [5,39] which were found

86

to be correlated with the carbon-rich fine fraction [5,39] and carbon stable isotopic composition (δ13C)

87

[5]. This continuum offers a unique opportunity to investigate Hg export and cycling along the

88

transition zone from estuarine-to-marine environments. By combining stable isotopic composition of

89

Hg and C, we aim to constrain geochemical processes and identify primary Hg sources along this unique

90

land-ocean transition zone.

2. Material and Methods

92

2.1. Sampling Site

93

The Adour estuary and the adjacent Capbreton canyon are located in the south eastern Bay of Biscay

94

(northeastern Atlantic Ocean, France). The Adour estuary is a mesotidal estuary within an urbanized

95

area, while agriculture and livestock activities dominate the upstream and watershed resulting in

96

different levels of anthropogenic impact [40]. The mean annual discharge is around 300 m3 s-1 but can

97

reach more than 2000 m3 s-1 during brief flood events [10,25,41], which makes the Adour the third

98

largest freshwater inflow into the Bay of Biscay [42]. The residence time of particles in the estuary is

99

short (hours to days) compared to estuaries with a stronger marine influence [13,43–45]. It has been

100

estimated that 75 % of the annual suspended matter flux occurs over 30 – 40 days during flooding

101

events [13]. Although the Capbreton canyon has naturally been disconnected from the Adour river

102

system in 1310 AD, the Adour remains the main sediment provider for the canyon, with active infill

103

and particle remobilization processes still ongoing [46–48].

104

The Adour estuary and adjacent marine area has been extensively studied for Hg contamination and

105

potential Hg transformations [5,10,25,40,41,44,49]. It has been shown that Hg water concentrations

106

within the estuary decreased with anthropogenic Hg emissions over the past 20 years [25]. However,

107

high levels of Hg (up to 975 ng g-1) have been shown to accumulate on the slopes and terraces of the

108

canyon, along with fine, organic-rich particles [5].

109
110

2.2. Sampling

111

The collected surface sediment samples represent an estuarine (Adour) to coastal-marine (Capbreton)

112

gradient (Figure 1). The Adour samples (inter-tidal) were obtained during the MICROPOLIT project in

113

three different sampling campaigns, in May 2017, September 2017, and January 2018 [41]. Capbreton

114

samples were obtained during the HAPOGE oceanographic cruise within the first 23.5 km of the

115

Capbreton and adjacent continental shelf [5]. Details on sampling have previously been published

116

elsewhere [5,41]. In brief, Adour (n = 9) surface samples (0 – 5 cm) were collected at low tide (tidal

coefficient 81 to 108) by grab sampling while surface Capbreton (n = 24) samples were either collected

118

with a Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle corer (HROV Ariane, Ifremer) or with a Van Veen grab

119

sampler. Samples were stored in clean polyethylene bags and stored at -20°C rapidly after sampling.

125

2.3. Total Hg Concentration Measurements and Ancillary Parameters

126

All samples were homogenized and freeze-dried before further handling and ground with an agate

127

mortar and pestle before digestion and total Hg analysis (THg). THg concentrations and ancillary

128

parameters for Adour and Capbreton samples and the corresponding analytical procedures have been

129

published elsewhere [5,41]. In brief, THg concentrations were determined on 50 – 100 mg of ground

130

samples by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) on an Advanced Mercury Analyzer (AMA-254,

131

Altec) for Adour samples. THg concentrations for Capbreton samples are the sum of MeHg and

132

inorganic Hg determined by species-specific isotope dilution GC ICP-MS on sediment digests. Detection

133

limit for THg in sediments based on three times the standard deviation (SD) of the digestion blank

134

(Capbreton) was better than 0.07 ng g-1 dry weight or three times the SD of blank measurements with

135

3 ng g-1 dry weight (Adour). Accuracy and precision were determined by analyzing international

136

certified materials of riverine and marine sediments (IAEA405/433, and BCR320R/580). For both

137

analytical methods, mean recoveries/concentrations were within the 95 % confidence interval of

138

certified values.

139

Total carbon (TC), particulate organic carbon (POC), carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N),

140

the C:N ratio and grain size distribution were determined on all samples as described previously [5,41].

141
142

2.4. Hg Isotope Measurements

143

Hg stable isotopes were measured on digested samples with a cold-vapor multi-collector ICP-MS (Nu

144

PLASMA Instruments, Wrexham UK) following the method described in previous studies [50,51]. Dry,

145

finely ground sediment samples were pre-digested with 3 mL HNO3 (69 – 70 %, Suprapure) and 1 mL

146

HCl (33 – 36 %, Suprapure) for a minimum of 8 hours before digestion on a Hot Block for 4 hours at

147

85°C. After addition of 1 mL of H2O2 (Ultrapure), this was followed by a second cycle of digestion of 2

148

hours. Samples were centrifuged (10 min, 4500 rpm) and supernatant recovered and stored at +4°C

149

until final dilution to 0.5 or 1 ng g-1 with 2 % HNO3 (69 – 70 %, Suprapure) for isotopic measurements.

150

To account for sample heterogeneity, replicate digestions and analyses were performed approximately

151

every 10 samples.

152

Total Hg isotopic composition was measured for the six most abundant stable Hg isotopes (198Hg, 199Hg,

via simultaneous introduction of NIST SRM 997 thallium by nebulization. Results are reported in the

The analytical uncertainty was assessed by repeated analysis of the UM-Almaden reference material

166

and procedural standards (Table SI 1) over different analytical sessions at Hg concentrations

167

corresponding to the samples. The mean values of for the UM-Almaden reference material agreed

168

with reported reference values [52]. Reported analytical uncertainties in all Figures were based on the

169

highest 2 SD obtained on reference material or procedural SRMs (0.18 ‰ for δ202Hg, 0.12 ‰ for Δ199Hg,

170

0.09 ‰ for Δ200Hg, and 0.12 ‰ for Δ201Hg). Sample heterogeneity, expressed as 1SD of replicates (n =

171

2 or 3), was similar or below the analytical uncertainty, except for δ202Hg of two Adour samples (A8

172

and A9) from the sampling campaign conducted in September (Table SI 2).

2.5. Hg Burial rates

174

The Capbreton canyon is a large incision in the continental shelf characterized by its high sediment

175

export from the land to the deep ocean, where elevated accumulation rates (more than 1 cm yr-1) are

176

observed on terraces [39,48]. To estimate Hg burial rates on the Capbreton Canyon terraces, we used

177

dry bulk density and surface THg concentrations for two sediment cores (G09, G23), applying

178

conservative sedimentation rates of 0.19 and 0.45 cm yr-1 from literature for the Capbreton Canyon

179

(see SI section 1.3 for details).

180
181

2.6. Statistical Testing and Binary Mixing Model for Source and Process Tracing

182

Statistical analysis was conducted in R using the rstatix package. Spearman correlations were

183

calculated, and differences between sampling groups and seasons were assessed using the non-

184

parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s post hoc test.

185

All binary mixing models were calculated following generalized equations Eq 3 and Eq 4:

186

(Eq 3) 𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐴 = 𝜎

187

(Eq 4) 𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐴 + 𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐵 = 1

188

Where 𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐴 and 𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐵 are the estimated contributions of pool A and pool B to the sample, 𝜎𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐴

189

and 𝜎𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐵 are the corresponding isotopic signatures of pool A and pool B, and 𝜎𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 is the isotopic

190

signature of the sample. We used 200Hg to calculate atmospheric Hg(0) (pool A) and precipitation-

191

derived Hg (pool B), 202Hg to calculated land-derived Hg (pool A) and Hg from direct atmospheric

192

deposition (pool B), and δ13C to calculate terrestrial C (pool A) and marine C (pool B).

193

After obtaining the contributions of atmospheric Hg(0) and precipitation-derived Hg (see SI section 1.4

194

for details on endmember) based on 200Hg, these were subsequently used to calculate the excess

195

Δ199Hg (Δ199Hgexc; Eq 5). The Δ199Hgexc represents Δ199Hg that cannot be explained by the mixing of Hg(0)

196

and precipitation-derived Hg alone.

∆199 𝐻𝑔 values in the Hg(0) and precipitation endmembers, respectively.

3.1. THg concentrations, stable isotopic composition of C and Hg

209

Table 1 summarizes THg concentrations, ancillary parameters (e.g. fine fraction, δ13C, δ15N), and Hg

210

stable isotopic composition for Adour and Capbreton sampling groups. Ancillary parameters and THg

211

concentrations have been reported in detail elsewhere for both Adour [41] and Capbreton samples

212

[5].

213

THg concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in Adour samples (median = 75 ng g-1 d.w.,

214

n = 27) than in Capbreton samples (median = 138 ng g-1 d.w., n = 24). The majority of Capbreton

215

samples (16 out of 24) and several Adour samples with a high urban influence (May: A4, A6;

216

September: A4, A6, A7; January: A6), had THg concentration above the 90th percentile (94.4 ng g-1 d.w.)

217

of selected literature data (marine and estuarine sediments for which THg and isotopic composition

218

data were available; Figure SI 2). While geogenic inputs have previously been shown to be insignificant

219

in Pyrenean lakes within the Adour catchment [53], the Adour estuary is anthropogenically impacted,

220

with declining Hg burdens corresponding to decreasing Hg emissions [25]. Anthropogenic point

221

sources (e.g. station A6 near a sewage treatment plant) [25,41] are likely responsible for slightly

222

elevated THg concentrations in Adour samples while high THg in Capbreton samples have previously

223

explained by enrichment of Hg on fine, organic-rich particles [5]. Indeed, we find a significant positive

224

correlation (Spearman, p < 0.05, Figure SI 3) between THg with δ13C (ρ = 0.58) (Figure 3A), and the fine

225

fraction (ρ = 0.51), for the whole dataset (Adour and Capbreton), whereas a significant correlation

226

(Spearman, p < 0.05) between THg and POC could only be established (both ρ = 0.67, Figure SI 4) when

227

separating the two sampling groups [5,41]. This confirms that high THg concentrations farthest from

228

the coast are not due to direct anthropogenic point sources in the estuary and are driven by fine

229

particles rather than just POC.

230

A significant difference (p < 0.05) between Adour and Capbreton samples was found for POC, the C:N

231

ratio, δ13C and δ15N, but not for the fine fraction. There was, however, a significant (p < 0.05) difference

232

in the fine fraction between Capbreton shelf (median = 37.6 %) and canyon samples (median = 70.2 %)

233

(Figure SI 5). This illustrates that coarser particles are mainly deposited near shore, while finer particles

234

are preferentially transported seaward and trapped in the canyon [5]. The lower δ13C (and δ15N, C:N

235

ratio) of Adour samples is consistent with typical values for terrestrial organic matter (Figure 2), while

236

the higher δ13C (and δ15N, C:N ratio) of Capbreton samples all together indicate a greater proportion

237

of marine organic matter (Figure 2, Figure SI 5) [54]. This confirms that, based on the major carbon

238

sources, our samples are representative of a terrestrial to marine continuum.

239

Despite the differences in THg concentrations and/or ancillary parameters, no significant difference (p

240

< 0.05) for Hg stable isotopic composition was found between Adour samples collected in different

241

seasons (Figure SI 6), nor between samples collected in the Capbreton canyon and its adjacent shelf

242

(Figure SI 5). We therefore assigned all sediment samples to one of two groups, estuarine (Adour) or

243

coastal-marine (Capbreton), based on their sampling location (Figure 1).

244

The observed Hg stable isotopic composition in this study for δ202Hg, Δ199Hg, Δ200Hg and, Δ201Hg were

245

on average ± 1SD, -0.70 ± 0.21 ‰ (range = -1.06 to - 0.27 ‰), -0.05 ± 0.05 ‰ (range = -0.14 to 0.08

Observed Hg isotopic signatures in the Adour-Capbreton sediments exhibited a relatively small range

248

and were within literature values (Figure SI 2). A significant (p < 0.05) difference between Adour and

Capbreton samples was found only for δ202Hg and Δ201Hg, with heavier values recorded in Capbreton

250

samples. The most notable, significant correlation (Spearman, p < 0.05) for Hg and C isotopic

251

composition along the estuarine-to-marine continuum was observed between δ202Hg and δ13C (ρ =

252

0.78, Figure 2B), showing an enrichment in heavier isotopes for more marine δ13C signatures.

253

In summary, along the estuarine-to-marine continuum from upstream to Capbreton canyon samples

254

(Figure 2C), we observe an overall shift towards higher THg concentrations, heavier MDF (δ202Hg) and

255

odd-MIF signatures (Δ199Hg, Δ201Hg), and a transition from mainly terrestrial carbon sources to a

256

greater contribution of marine carbon sources (Figure 2).

3.2. Influence of biogeochemical processes on Hg stable isotopes

271

Biogeochemical processes can affect both the MDF (δ202Hg) and odd-MIF (Δ199Hg, Δ201Hg) isotopic

272

composition of Hg, potentially overprinting source signatures. Two mechanisms are known to

273

influence the odd-MIF, the nuclear volume effect (NVE) [35], and the magnetic isotope effect (MIE)

274

[34]. Elemental Hg evaporation [56,57] and equilibrium Hg-thiol complexation [58] are found to have

275

a NVE with experimentally determined Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg slopes of 1.65 – 2.0 and 1.56, respectively. The

276

MIE is found for example during photo-reactions of aqueous Hg, with experimentally determined

277

Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg slopes of 1.00 – 1.3 [33,59,60]. Given that MeHg typically represent a small fraction of

278

THg (<1%) in Adour and Capbreton sediments [5,40], fractionation related to methylation of Hg(II) [51]

279

or photo-demethylation of MeHg [33] can be neglected for our samples.

280

As shown in Figure 3, no clear trends were observed between the Adour river and the coastal samples

281

along the 1.00 or 1.56 Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg slope, characteristic for MIE or NVE respectively (Figure 3B). This,

282

together with the narrow range of odd-MIF (Δ199Hg = -0.14 – 0.08 ‰), suggests a limited influence of

283

photochemical reduction of Hg before incorporation into sediments for both Capbreton and Adour

284

samples. This is in line with previous studies, which observed insignificant odd-MIF in open seawater

285

beyond the signatures resulting from the mixing of two atmospheric Hg(0) and Hg(II) sources [27].

286

In contrast, a difference between estuarine and marine sediments with a shift towards heavier odd-

287

MIF signatures along the ~1.00 Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg slope due to enhanced photo-reduction in marine

288

compared to estuarine waters (Figure 3B) had previously been observed in the subtropical South China

289

Sea [17]. For our study area, however, it has been demonstrated that ~75% of the annual flux of

290

suspended solids from the Adour river occurs during flooding events, mobilizing large particles that

291

rapidly settle [13]. During such events, the short residence time and increase in turbidity can limit

292

photochemical processes [10].

293

To further address if photochemical or processes impacted Δ199Hg of our samples, we evaluate the

294

excess of Δ199Hg (Δ199Hgexc), where Δ199Hgexc represents the deviation of Δ199Hg from the expected

16
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2k6k4 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0007-1234-8740 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

295

Δ199Hg through mixing of Hg(0) and precipitation endmembers. The presence of significant positive or

296

negative Δ199Hgexc would suggest a significant influence of additional pre- or post-depositional

297

processes affecting the odd-MIF and MDF Hg isotopic composition [27]. Here, we observe neither a

298

significant ( = 0.05) Δ199Hgexc for any Adour or Capbreton sample (see Figure SI 8, Figure SI 9), nor a

299

significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s post-hoc) in mean Δ199Hgexc between Adour and

300

Capbreton sample groups. The absence of such is consistent with a significant (Spearman, p < 0.05)

301

correlation between Δ200Hg and Δ199Hg (ρ = 0.63), suggesting that the observed variation of Δ199Hg can

302

be explained by the mixing of two atmospheric sources of Hg (Hg(0) and precipitation-derived Hg)

303

alone.

304

That said, there are also other processes that may influence δ202Hg values while inducing only minor

305

or negligible Δ199Hg fractionation. One example is equilibrium Hg-thiol complexation, which enriches

306

heavy Hg isotopes in the residual dissolved pool with a fractionation factor of ~0.5 ‰ for δ202Hg and a

307

smaller fractionation (<0.1‰) for Δ199Hg [58]. Given the complexity of our study system and the

308

limitation of our data on sediments, the extent to which Hg-thiol complexation affects the isotopic

309

signature of the dissolved Hg pool remains uncertain.

3.3. Hg Burial Rates and Hg Accumulation on Fine Particles

319

The Hg burial rates were estimated for two samples located on terraces but at different distances to

320

the coast. For station G09 at the head of the canyon (3.7 km from the coast, δ13C of -25.5 ‰) receiving

321

both terrestrial and marine C, and station G23, one of the farthest stations from the coast (23.5 km

322

from the coast, δ13C of 23.9 ‰), receiving mostly marine C based on δ13C. Following THg

323

concentrations, estimated Hg burial rates were lower near the coast (G09, 197 – 466 µg Hg m-2 yr-1)

324

than for farther off-shore canyon terraces (G23, 927 – 2196 µg Hg m-2 yr-1). Hg burial rates at the canyon

325

head are 5 to 12 times higher than median global shelf (39 µg Hg m-2 yr-1) [28] burial rates, while rates

326

at the distal canyon terraces are 24 to 56 times higher, demonstrating an unprecedently high

327

accumulation of Hg in the Capbreton canyon terraces.

328

Maximum THg concentration (> 500 ng g-1 d.w.), exceeding concentrations reported in contaminated

329

shelf sediments including the Bohai Sea, China (574 ng g-1) [61], were found furthest from the coast in

330

Capbreton samples [5,39]. Azaroff et al. 2019 already hypothesized that these high Hg concentrations

331

may be controlled by the accumulation of Hg on fine particles [5], which efficiently transport Hg into

332

the Capbreton Canyon , acting as a sediment trap. They could, however, give no insight about the origin

333

of the high Hg concentrations in these samples.

334

Based on our Hg stable isotopic composition observations, we can exclude a point source

335

contamination as a possible reason for the highly concentrated Capbreton samples (above 732 ng g-1).

336

Indeed, we do not find a significant difference (p < 0.05) in Hg isotope composition (δ202Hg, Δ199Hg, and

337

Δ200Hg) between highly (above 732 ng g-1, n = 3) and low-concentrated (n = 3) Capbreton sediments of

338

the marine δ13C endmember (above -24.4 ‰) (Figure SI 10). This suggests that the Hg in both the high

339

and low-concentration marine-endmember samples originates from the same pool, raising questions

340

about the underlying processes leading to elevated THg concentrations in fine particles.

341

Both THg concentrations and δ202Hg isotopic composition for Capbreton samples were significantly

342

(p < 0.05) correlated with water depth and δ13C (thus distance to the coast; Figure 2, Figure SI 11).

343

However, the absence of a significant correlation between the fine fraction and Hg isotopic

344

composition (δ202Hg, Δ199Hg, Δ201Hg; Figure SI 11) suggests that δ202Hg variability cannot be explained

345

by particle size-dependent isotopic fractionation during particle transport.

346

Efficient accumulation of Hg on fine particles may be explained by the longer settling times of finer

347

particles in the canyon, which enables a proportionally greater organic carbon remineralization and

348

higher Hg concentrations due to “regenerative scavenging”, where Hg is rapidly re-scavenged onto

349

particulate organic matter [4,28]. In addition, frequent resuspension and transport of fine organic-rich

350

particles through gravity-driven mass movements within the canyon may allow for additional Hg

351

accumulation on fine particles [46–48]. Similar observations have been reported, far from direct

352

anthropogenic influence, for trench sediments with high Hg concentrations (up to 400 ng g-1) [28,62].

353

Given that Hg sedimentation to deep oceanic sediments is one of few ways to remove Hg from the

354

marine biogeochemical cycle [63], further investigation into the underlying processes is needed in the

355

future.

356

3.4. Discrimination of Potential Hg Sources to Estuarine-to-Marine Sediments

357

In our system, Hg mainly originates from vegetational uptake (atmospheric Hg(0)), urban influence,

358

and precipitation (mostly Hg(II)). Both are stored in soils and enter the river system through runoff

359

before being exported to the coastal ocean [25,53]. In addition, Hg may be deposited to the ocean via

360

direct atmospheric deposition of Hg(0) (dry) and Hg(II) (wet and dry) [27]. Terrestrial Hg, i.e. Hg(0)

361

sequestered by foliage and subsequently oxidized, is imprinted with a significant (>2 ‰) shift towards

362

lighter δ202Hg values [64], while post-depositional processes and Hg re-emission may induce a

363

significant shift in both δ202Hg and Δ199Hg in soils or atmospheric accumulators [64].

364

The potential sources of Hg in sediments for our study area are compiled in Figure 4 along with local

365

isotopic signatures for lichens, mosses [65], soils [65], total gaseous mercury (here assumed equal to

366

Hg(0)), precipitation [38,66], and the global open ocean [27]. Dry Hg(0) deposition typically dominates

367

Hg signatures in soils and atmospheric accumulators, such as lichens and mosses. This was also

368

established for local (catchment area of the Adour river) lichens and mosses in the western Pyrenees

369

with an Hg(0) contribution of ~80 % on average (Figure SI 9) (Barre et al. 2018, 2020). A considerable

370

deviation from the linear regression of Δ¹⁹⁹Hg and Δ²⁰⁰Hg signatures for Hg(0) and precipitation

371

suggests that most local soil, lichen, and some moss samples were affected by post-depositional

372

processes (Figure 4B). This is exemplified by a mean negative Δ199Hgexc for soils and lichens (Figure SI

373

9), while Δ199Hgexc for mosses was more variable (Figure SI 8) [65].

374

For Adour and Capbreton sediment samples, however, we do not observe such deviation of Δ199Hg

375

from the theoretical mixing between Hg(0) and precipitation-derived Hg (Figure 4D). This is in line with

376

the previously established absence of Δ199Hgexc. The absence of Δ199Hgexc in Adour sediments suggests

377

that Hg in estuarine sediments has not undergone such post-depositional processes. However, it

378

cannot be excluded that another process or source may obscure the Δ199Hgexc signature, or that most

379

lichens, and to some extent soils samples do not represent our estuarine Hg endmember found in

380

Adour sediments (Δ199Hg, possibly δ202Hg).

381

We propose that the observed shift towards heavier δ202Hg with marine δ13C reflects a gradual shift

382

from land-derived i.e. terrestrial Hg which has mainly undergone vegetational uptake with possible

383

anthropogenic impact, to a marine Hg signature from direct atmospheric deposition of Hg(II) (wet and

384

dry) and Hg(0) (roughly 1:1) [27].

385

We find that Adour sediment samples lack Δ199Hgexc and have heavier δ202Hg signatures than reported

386

for most soils, lichens and mosses of the Adour catchment area [65,67]. Barre et al. (2018) reported

387

distinct δ202Hg and Δ199Hg in lichens based on land uses. While background lichens had lightest δ202Hg

388

(-1.99 ± 0.45 ‰) and Δ199Hg values (-0.32 ± 0.10 ‰), heavier signatures were found for lichens sampled

389

within the industrial sector (δ202Hg =-1.10 ± 0.35 ‰, and Δ199Hg = -0.28 ± 0.07 ‰) and for lichens

390

directly impacted by the steel industry (δ202Hg -0.68 ± 0.32 ‰, and Δ199Hg = -0.10 ± 0.18 ‰) (Figure

391

4A) [67]. The Hg isotopic composition in Adour sediments may thus reflect a significant urban influence

392

potentially imprinted in surrounding soils, consistent with the proximity of the sampling sites to urban

393

areas and industrial facilities [41]. However, based on our data, we cannot rule out the influence of

394

marine Hg on Adour sediments in the highly dynamic estuarine system [45], potentially obscuring

395

lighter δ202Hg and Δ199Hg. All Adour sediments were influenced by displacement and frequent

396

resuspension [68], as the upstream sample (A1) of this study was collected at the limit of the salinity

397

intrusion.

398

Our hypothesis aligns with previous sediment studies on estuarine to marine gradients with similar

399

observations [14,16]. It is also supported by a study on Hg stable isotopes in filtered (0.45 µm) waters

400

over an estuarine to pelagic gradient (South China Sea) which reported a trend towards heavier δ202Hg

401

(MDF) along with a decrease in total Hg further from the coast [69], while urban influenced coastal

402

waters of the Mediterranean had δ202Hg and Δ199Hg close to 0 (Figure SI 12) [27]. Overall, this aligns

403

with our observations: as terrestrial carbon becomes increasingly diluted with distance from the coast,

404

so does land-derived Hg (- MDF), while marine carbon is associated with a distinct, heavier oceanic Hg

405

pool (+ MDF) (Figure 2B, Figure 4C).

3.5. Implications for Hg Source Apportionment in Coastal Marine Systems

420

Our data suggest that biogeochemical processes had a minor influence on Hg isotopic composition and

421

that the observed differences in δ202Hg along the estuarine to coastal-marine continuum are best

422

explained by a mixing of different Hg sources. To decipher the main sources of Hg in the study area,

423

we applied a two-endmember mixing model. The two endmembers were defined as land-derived Hg

424

i.e. derived from vegetational uptake and anthropogenic impact (lichens industrial sector), and direct

425

atmospheric deposition of Hg (open ocean).

426

We find a significant difference between sampling groups (Figure SI 13), with a higher land-derived Hg

427

contribution in Adour (70 ± 19 %) compared to Capbreton samples (33 ± 19 %). While the estimated

428

fraction of terrestrial Hg naturally depends on the defined endmembers, our results illustrate the

429

progressive dilution of land-derived Hg along the estuarine-marine sediment gradient.

430

It is notable that, if approximately 70% of Hg in sediment samples from the Adour estuary is land-

431

derived, around 30 % is not. This may be explained by a direct anthropogenic (urban) influence in these

432

sediments, the transport of marine Hg from the shelf into the Adour estuary (for instance through tidal

433

pumping), or a combination of both. However, due to the absence of Hg isotopic composition

434

difference in the “direct anthropogenic” and “marine” pools for our study area (both + MDF, as

435

obtained from literature), we are not able to resolve this question here.

436

We give a conservative estimate on land-derived Hg burial rates (Hgland-derived), considering the

437

established minimum Hg burial rates at the Canyon head (G09: 97 µg Hg m-2 yr-1) and the farthest

438

Canyon terrace (G23: 927 µg Hg m-2 yr-1), and the respective mean land-derived Hg contribution. The

439

slightly higher mean contribution of direct atmospheric deposition for G23 (29 %) than for G09 (18 %)

440

is clearly offset by higher burial rates on terraces further in the canyon, amounting to ~57 µg Hgland-

441

derived m

442

that the canyon functions as a major sediment trap for both land-derived and marine Hg.

443

To examine the joint behavior of Hg and C along this estuarine-to-marine continuum, we selected

444

endmembers based on spatial location (Figure 1, Figure 2C), with the upstream sample A1 (average of

-2

yr-1 at the canyon head and ~165 µg Hgland-derived m-2 yr-1 in farthest terraces. This underscores

445

three seasons) for the land-derived Hg and C endmembers, while samples G22-G24, farthest from the

446

coast and with the highest THg concentrations, serve as the marine endmembers. We find a linear

447

relationship close to 1 (Figure 5) between land-derived Hg and terrestrial C fractions calculated from

448

Hg and C isotopes, indicating that Hg and C are being jointly diluted in our system. In agreement with

449

the short residence time of suspended particulate matter in the estuary [43,68], the Hg and C

450

relationship indicates that both terrestrial Hg and C are efficiently exported from the estuary and

451

buried into coastal and canyon sediments.

452

Our results suggest that the fraction of terrestrial carbon in a coastal sediment sample may give direct

453

insights into the fraction of land-derived Hg it contains. This implies that the amount of land-derived

454

Hg could be adequately estimated by knowing the THg concentration and the carbon isotope

455

composition alone, reducing the reliance on Hg isotope composition measurements. On one hand, this

456

could enable new sampling campaigns and field studies with a greater temporal or regional coverage,

457

as measuring carbon isotopes is significantly simpler and far less costly than measuring Hg isotopes.

458

On the other hand, such a relationship could allow the scientific community to leverage existing

459

databases containing joint observations of Hg concentration and carbon isotope composition to

460

estimate land-derived Hg inputs into coastal oceans worldwide. Before that, however, it is imperative

461

to confirm the validity of this relationship between terrestrial C and land-derived Hg for other coastal

462

Figure 5. Binary-mixing model based on δ202Hg and δ13C values along the estuarine-to-marine
gradient suggests joint sedimentation of land-derived Hg and terrestrial C. Endmember samples (A1
all seasons, G22, G23, G24) selected based on their spatial distribution, are displayed without color.
Error bars depict propagation uncertainties (50 % confidence interval) from analytical measurement
uncertainties (δ202Hg and δ13C) and the variability between endmember samples (standard error of
mean). The continuous line represents the best fit to all while the shaded grey area indicates the
2.5th and 97.5th confidence interval of the fit.
