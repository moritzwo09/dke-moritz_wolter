Potassium ion is the most common compound in all living organisms, with intercellular
[K+]:[Na+] ratios greater than 1 across all domains of life. While most natural aquifers are
rich in sodium, it is believed that localized potassium-rich environments were crucial for
initiating prebiotic reaction networks leading to the origin of life. Several current
hypotheses, based on modern geochemical observations, suggest that hydrothermal fields
and their associated clays could have provided such environments. My work expands on
current prebiotic theories regarding the origins of high potassium concentrations by
providing a geochemical basis for the empirical observations proposed by other authors.
Here, I show how abiotic enrichment in potassium can occur during the acidic alteration of
a wide range of aluminum silicate rocks through the formation of alum salts
(KAl(SO4)2•12H2O). I further propose how simple and well-known alum chemistry can
lead to the accumulation of important biological molecules, such as phosphates, ammonia,
and carboxylic acids. I provide a general thermodynamic model, proof-of-concept
experiments, and a chemical rationale for the plausibility and importance of potassiumrich environments in the origin of life. This work suggests that potassium enrichment could
have been one of the earliest steps in the origins of life, defining the reaction conditions
where most prebiotic reactions took place. Since potassium is both the most common and
simplest component in all living organisms on Earth, understanding the geochemical
conditions that lead to potassium enrichment is valuable for comprehending the origins of
life on Earth and the search for life elsewhere in the universe, including on our closest
neighbor, Mars.

Introduction
Biochemistry of Sodium and Potassium
Most of the origin of life research has been focused on prebiotic synthesis of precursors
of peptides and nucleic acids, metal sulfides and the rise of reaction networks formed by small
molecules. Less widely appreciated is the surprising similarity of the internal composition and
smaller components that are common to all living cells, indicating common chemical origins of
life, and likely pointing to the environments where life begun. Some of these similarities, named
“Chemical Fossils” by George Whitesides are high Potassium to Sodium ratio in all living cells,
thiol and thioester chemistry, metal sulfides, isoprenoids and condensed phosphates (Whitesides,
2016).
Potassium is the most abundant cation in the cytoplasm across all domains of life; as a
general rule, intermolecular potassium concentration is one or two orders of magnitude larger in
living cells compared to non-living environments, where, generally, the predominant cation is
sodium. The ratio of potassium to sodium inside the cells is usually much larger than 1, and
approximately the inverse of the ratio observed in non-living environments (Table 1). Some
organisms, predominantly animals, spend up to 40% of all their energy maintaining this ratio.
Despite very limited chemical activity of potassium, it has numerous functions in living
cells: it maintains osmotic pressure of cell interior, it is a necessary cofactor for several oldest
highly conserved enzymes, including ribozymes, GTPases and peptidyl transfer units (Danchin,
2019). Potassium channels, responsible for extraction of Potassium from the environment, have
been found in all types of living organisms and include [K+]/[Na+] ATPases in animals, where

they are the basis of cognition, and conserved families of transporter channels in bacteria, fungi
and plants known as Trk/Ktr/HKT(Corratgé-Faillie et al. 2010).

*Varies during development stages
** in mmol/kg dry weight
*** Increased with increase of osmolarity of the medium
In 2012 Mulkijanian et al. provided strong arguments, based on analysis of evolution of
oldest enzymes, in favor of life starting in potassium rich environments rather than evolving to
use potassium later on (Mulkidjanian et al. 2012). These and several follow up papers pointed
out that modern hydrothermal fields sometimes produce vapor enriched in potassium that
potentially, and condensation of the vapor could lead to potassium rich environments where life
started. An alternative approach to the potassium-rich environments have been suggested by H.
Hansma, who pointed out that biotite micas are usually rich in potassium and magnesium, and
small, nanosized compartments between the mica sheets could have been assembly points of
early Earth polymers (Hansma, 2022). Since biotite mica formation is associated with volcanic
fields and rock weathering in general, this hypothesis can be seen as co-existing with
Mulkijanian ideas.
Sodium and Potassium are small alkaline cations; they do not have any strong catalytic
activity in aqueous reactions, and have been usually considered as counter ions, equilibrating
negative charges of “more interesting” molecules. Because of their remarkable different role in
living cells, Bracher’s group have studied their role in prebiotic chemistry, to find chemical basis
of this difference. His group have shown that sodium and potassium salts have distinct activity in
peptide condensation reactions, with potassium favoring linear peptide formation, vs. cyclic
peptides favored by sodium (Campbell T.D., 2019).
Instead of trying to find out the set of primordial reactions responsible for the selection of
potassium, I would like to point out to the simple thermodynamic differences based on the
solubilities of their salts. While the inorganic salts, such as chloride, sulfate and nitrate have very
similar solubility for both cations, potassium salts of biologically relevant anions, such as
4

phosphates, oligophosphates and carboxylic acids are almost an order of magnitude more soluble
than sodium salts (Table 2). Given that some of the early prebiotic reactions could have
happened in very concentrated solutions, created either by wet-dry cycles or molecular crowding
in the presence of early prebiotic polymers, an order of magnitude higher concentration of the
reagent can lead to 10x increase in observed reaction rate, which would make a big difference in
early selection processes. However, concentrations of organic acids as phosphates are presumed
to have been very low on early Earth and a mechanism of enrichment for these compounds has to
be proposed first. Since potassium is much more abundant geochemically, finding potassium rich
environments seems to be a more straightforward starting point.

The best way to do it is by first understanding the sources of alkaline cations in natural
waters. Both sodium and potassium in natural waters come from the chemical weathering of
common crustal rocks, igneous and sedimentary, such as granites, basalts and shales(Kastner
5

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-36wg8 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1994-0847 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

1974). Feldspars are common mineral components of most crustal rocks; sodium rich feldspars
(enriched in albite, NaAlSi3O8 , ΔG0 = -884.0 kcal/mol)(Huang 1974) are formed at higher
temperatures than potassium feldspars (K-spare, KAlSi3O8 , ΔG0 = -892.6 kcal/mol)(Huang
1974) and weather out faster, eventually producing ground water with [Na+]>[K+]. Feldspar
weathering occurs as a reaction with ground waters saturated with respect to the atmospheric
CO2 with resulting low concentrations of sodium and potassium in aqueous solution (< 1 mM at
environment temperature).

(1)

In case of potassium-rich volcanic lakes proposed by Mulkijanina et al, the weathering of
rocks follows different mechanism and is the result of leaching K-enriched volcanic rocks by
ultra-acid volcanic waters (Varekamp 2015).
Rocks at volcano-hydrothermal fields undergo acidic alteration (White 2013). Alteration
means interaction of an aqueous solution with rock when a set of igneous minerals, formed at
high temperature and unstable at the Earth’s surface, dissolves and a new set of stable lowtemperature-pressure minerals is formed. When aqueous solutions are acidic, the set of stable
minerals are rich in aluminum and includes aluminum sulfates, aluminum hydroxides and a
number of clay minerals enriched in aluminum and silica, including mica and biotite. Common
sources of acidity are magmatic HCl and sulfuric acids. The latter is formed in condensed
magmatic vapors by aqueous redox-disproportionation of the absorbed magmatic SO2 according
to the reactions (2) and (3):(Kusakabe et al. 2000)

Sulfuric acid can react with aluminosilicate matrix of rocks, and form aluminum sulfate
salts alum and alunite, for example:

(4)

There is a set of Al-sulfate minerals with different solubility in water, and thus can
undergo precipitation-based separation proposed in the previous step. The most recent
estimations of their thermodynamic properties (Stoffregen et al. 2000) have confirmed that Naalunite (NaAl3(SO4)2(OH)6) is about two orders of magnitude more soluble than alunite
(KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6), and alum (KAl(SO4)2•12H2O) (Table 2).
A two-stage mechanism based on alum formation can be proposed for the K+-enrichment
of an aqueous solution: (1) aluminum oxide and sodium and potassium cations are extracted
from aluminosilicate rocks in the presence of sulfuric acid; (2) formed solution is slowly
evaporated allowing formation of sodium and potassium alum salts; (3) soluble sodium salts are
removed by stepwise washing of the solution with neutral water; (3) the remaining less soluble
potassium alum salts are re-dissolved with fresh rain or ground water of low ionic strength,
forming potassium rich lakes or pools (Figure 1).

Results
First part of this work shows potassium enrichment possibility via thermodynamic calculations
with volcanic rocks of different composition: basalts and rhyolites. Second part demonstrates
viability of proposed approach by achieving cation separation using pure ß-Al2O3 oxide as well
as igneous and metamorphic rocks with different degree of alteration. Both theoretical and
experimental approaches suggest that potassium alum can achieve potassium over sodium
enrichment comparable to those found in modern intercellular environments.

Formation of Potassium- Rich Environments: Thermodynamic Calculations

To find the optimal conditions for separation of sodium and potassium we used water
rock titration method (Hedenquist & Taran 2013). Specifically, in this calculation, to 1kg

aqueous solution of 0.1M sulfuric acid at 25oC were added isothermally small portions of
rhyolite or basalt rocks and allowed to reach equilibrium after each step (Table 3). We excluded
Mg2+ from the calculations for the sake of simplicity, since Mg2+ sulfates are highly soluble and
will remain in aqueous phase. Here we present results for basalt. Results for rhyolite were very
similar and are included in SI.

The rock to water weight ratio varied from 1/1000 to 1/10, and the source of all chemical
species except sulfate, including [Na+] and [K+], was the rock itself. The equilibrium set of
minerals and the associated aqueous solutions as a function of rock-water ratio at 25°C is shown
in Figure 2. In a region at rock/water ratio ~ 20 g/kg supernatant has a high Al3+, Na+ and K+
concentrations. We selected a composition of the solution with maximum Al3+ and K+
concentration at r/w = 16 g/kg and modeled it's evaporation by stepwise loss of vapor and
increase in concentration of all components that resulted in precipitation of new minerals.
Precipitation started after ~50% of the vapor loss with silica, alum and anhydrite phases. In the
region corresponding to 50-90% evaporation, alum is a predominant K-bearing salt. Sodium-rich
minerals, such as highly soluble Na2SO4 occur only at the end of the evaporation, when the
solution has lost more than 92% of water vapor (Figure 2).

To form a potassium rich environment, we equilibrated 60 g of the precipitated mineral
mixture from the previous step, consisting of ~70 wt% of alum, 20 wt% of amorphous silica and
7.5% of anhydrite and less than 0.1 wt% of Na+ salts, with 1 kg of pure water. The resulting
solutions are practically Na-free with a final K+/Na+ ratio >300 for the rhyolite mixture and
K+/Na+ ratio > 30 for the basalt mixture.

Experimental Formation of Potassium-Rich Solutions via Rock Leaching and Evaporation
cycles.
To simulate water rock interactions on Early Earth we conducted leaching of several
igneous and metamorphic rocks of variable aluminum content. We added acidic sulfate solutions
with pH 1and [K+]/[Na+] ratio 1:5, which is close to the upper limit of natural potassium rich
waters, to finely crushed rocks with the initial water to rock weight ratio 10:1 and left the
mixture to evaporate at controlled relative humidity under nitrogen atmosphere. We observed
that most consistent results were obtained at relative humidity 20 to 30%. At lower humidity
sodium sulfate tended to “creep” (Van Enckevort & Los 2013) out of solution and precipitate
outside the wells where evaporation took place.
We equilibrated the solution with the rocks for one month, followed by 3 days of
evaporation. Large transparent orthogonal crystals up to 1 cm in diameter usually appeared when
90% of the solution had evaporated (Figure 2A). Rates of formation of alum crystals were the
fastest for zeolites, and the slowest for basalt and layered clays. Crystals were collected,
weighted to calculate yield and analyzed by XRD analysis with subsequent database search that
confirmed the formula KAl(SO4)2•12H2O, corresponding to alum (Table 3, Figure 5 and SI). To
demonstrate the formation of potassium-rich environments, we decanted supernatant, briefly
washed remained solids with distilled water, re-dissolved the solid in fresh portion of distilled
water, and took aliquot of solution for the subsequent ICP analysis (Table 5). Potassium content
of resulting solutions was broadly correlated with aluminum content of the minerals.

To link this work with current visionof high potassium environment I obtained alum from
reaction of basalt powder and sulfuric acid. Experimental basalt weathering led to the formation
of biotite mica (Figure 4) as one of the major decomposition products. These results link

simulating hydrothermal environments. At this temperature aluminum sulfate salts decomposed
producing a mixture of sulfates of both cations with no enrichment in potassium.
Conditions used in these experiments are mild temperature, temperatures (20-70 oC), dry
atmosphere (humidity below 30%, to allow evaporation), volcanic activity with SO2 rich
fumaroles as a source of sulfuric acid, and periodic rain and draught seasons. This fits well with
the field observations on oldest zircons, which were formed at mild temperatures and were found
incrusted in bed of strongly weathered clays(Wilde et al. 2001).

Discussion
Spontaneous formation of potassium rich solutions fits within the other processes and
reactions already explored in different origin of life scenarios. Evaporation and re-dissolution
processes described here have been used extensively in the origins of life research, including the
formation of vesicles made of fatty acids,(Deamer et al. 2006) phosphorylation of sugars(Powner
et al. 2009), polycondensation of RNA,(Da Silva et al. 2015) amino acids(Hosni et al. 2015) and
carboxylic acids.(Forsythe et al. 2015). We also observe biotite formation that has been
highlighted as a potential potassium-rich assembly hub for prebiotic macromolecules by Hansma
(Hansma, 2022), thus consolidating different views on origin of potassium.
Aluminum oxide is the key component in proposed mechanism of potassium enrichment.
Despite the ubiquity of aluminum and sulfates, there is no known organism that actively uses
them: the most common anions used by living organisms are phosphates and carboxylic acids.
Since none of those are abundant on a geological scale[26] a mechanism for concentration of
these salts had to exist. Potassium alum has been used historically to concentrate and precipitate
diluted solutions of organic molecules by neutralizing negative charge and allowing big portions
of organic molecules to coagulate. Several plausible routes to prebiotic organic molecules over

15

the years have been proposed: mainly, the delivery of organic carbon by carbonaceous chondrite
meteorites and CO2 condensation in reductive environments. In both cases carboxylic acids and
sometimes alcohols and sugars are common products are observed in low concentrations.
Precipitation with alum salts would be a plausible concentration mechanism for the organics
produces vie either pathway.
In addition to the enrichment in potassium and ammonium, acid leaching and subsequent
evaporation of brines could have facilitated the concentration of phosphates. The main source of
phosphates is apatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F,Cl)2, present in igneous rocks at 0.1-1 wt%() . During
rock’s leaching with sulfuric acid, apatite is dissolved, calcium is trapped as anhydride (CaSO4)
and phosphoric acid is liberated. The same leaching mechanisms that led to potassium
accumulation could facilitate phosphate extraction from apatite bearing rocks. Phosphate can
react with aluminum sulfate and form insoluble precipitate with aluminum oxide[30] which ca be
re-dissolved in solutions of di and tricarboxilic acids[31].
Apart from anion concentration, potassium cations are close in size to ammonia cations
and can be partially substituted by the later in alum and alunite crystalline structures[29] .
Ammonia is less abundant in rocks than potassium and probably its minerals could be found as
trace minerals in larger potassium alum deposits. Ammonia salts are often found around volcanic
lakes: ammonium alunite has been reported in volcanic gas sublimates at Vulcano volcano.
Another key players in prebiotic reaction are metal sulfides. Metal- sulfur clusters are
among oldest coenzymes found in all living organisms and there is a general agreement that they
origins were mineral, probably beginning from biomineralization of iron sulfides, such as
pyrites.[35] Pyrite is common in volcanic environment, and it was observed in all modeling
experiments where it is formed during rock weathering with high rock/water ratios (Figure 2A).

In practical terms it means that if potassium rich pond is formed from discharge of acidic spring,
the shores, where water to rock ratio is the lowest, would be enriched in pyrite.
Components that we suspect to be building blocks for the first cells could have been
found in abundance in potassium alum rich environments, resolving a concentration problem,
pointed out by de Duve and Miller[36][37] that inevitably arises in other prebiotic chemistry
scenarios. We suggest that the possibility of formation of such environments could be an
indicator of habitability of the planet.
Alum has been observed at southern highlands of Terra Sirenum on Mars, and has been
suggested an indicator for previous life on Mars.[38] It would be interesting to establish K+/Na+
ratio of these mineral deposits (for example, from degree of efflorescence during changes in
temperature). Potassium rich deposits could indicate if Mars ever had rains and periodic changes
in the levels of liquid water necessary to accumulate important prebiotic molecules for further
steps in the origins of life.

Conclusions

Potassium is a major constituent of all living organisms and it has been previously
suggested that life started in potassium rich environments, which are uncommon due to higher
abundance of chemically similar sodium ion. We have shown that during the multistep acidic
alteration of basalt and rhyolite – two of the most common components of the Earth’s crust - the
resulting eluent is enriched in potassium via formation of poorly soluble alum mineral.
Evaporation and equilibration processes, necessary for the enrichment of potassium are often
used in origin of life studies for synthesis of a range of biomolecules and well-known alum
chemistry could have led to accumulation of other prebiotic molecules, such as phosphates,

carboxylic acids, iron sulfides and ammonium. Both chemical and geochemical reactions might
well have converged early, in which case environments with high potassium concentrations or
high K+/Na+ ratios would be the signatures of life or processes related to its origins.

Experimental
Thermodynamic Simulations:
We modeled water-rock interaction using the HCS-7 thermochemical computer code
(HSC Chemistry(Roine 2007), www.outotec.com). Thermodynamic data for most aqueous
species and minerals in the HSC database were taken mainly from SUPCRT92(Johnson et al.
1992) updated to SUPCRT95. Data for some aqueous species and minerals was compiled from
other sources, up to 2005(Sverjensky et al. 1997). We simulated weathering of two types of
common igneous rocks with the composition of each rock provided in Table 1: generalized
rhyolite (volcanic rocks rich in SiO2, poor in iron and magnesium oxides) and generalized basalt
(volcanic rocks rich in iron and magnesium oxides). Magnesium was excluded from the set of
main components for the reason of simplicity and because at low temperature and under acidic
conditions its minerals are unstable and all magnesium transferred into the aqueous
phase.(Giggenbach 1988)
The prebiotic chemistry experiments are conducted across a wide range of temperatures,
from -20 to 100 oC, however the results of the analysis of the isotopic composition of Acasta
Gneiss zircons suggest that early Earth had temperate surface temperatures (20 oC) during the
times of life's origins.(Wilde et al. 2001) After taking into account this information we chose to
perform the simulations at 25 oC.

Molecular Sieve 3A 8-12 mesh beads were obtained from EM Science; Al2O3, K2SO4,
Na2SO4 GR ACS from EMD; Kaolin USP from Sigma; Montmorillonite K10 from Aldrich;
other minerals were obtained from WARD’s Natural science Geology Study pack.
In typical experiment acidic sulfate brine, pH 1, 1:5 to 1:10 [K+]/[Na+] ratio, was added
to finely-ground solids, with 10:1 initial water to rock ratio. Solutions were equilibrated up to
one month (monitored by change in pH), sometimes addition of distilled water to maintain the
same water level was necessary. After equilibration, 90% of water was evaporated, thereby
causing potassium aluminum sulfate salts to crystallize out of solution.
Formed crystals were collected, weighted (yield reported as an average of 3 independent
experiments) and characterized by XRD (D2 Phaser); remaining liquid was decanted, solid
washed with distilled water, decanted, fresh solid added and 200 µL of supernatant placed into
15 mL Falcon tubes, dissolved in 10 mL with 2% HNO3 and [K+]/[Na+] ratio was analyzed by
ICP-AES in radial mode (ICP AES Leeman Labs PS-1000). Concentrations were calculated
from calibration curves.
