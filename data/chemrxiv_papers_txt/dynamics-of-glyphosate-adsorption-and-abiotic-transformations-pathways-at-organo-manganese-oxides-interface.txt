Abstract

Glyphosate, the most commonly used and widely detected herbicide worldwide, adsorbs and

24

degrades on environmental surfaces, with natural organic matter playing a significant role in

25

these processes. This study provides mechanistic and kinetic insights on how organo-mineral

26

associations affect adsorption/desorption and abiotic oxidation of glyphosate. We use in-situ

27

ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and microfluidic experiments coupled to LC-MS determination of

28

glyphosate transformation by-products. A model protein (BSA) and Mn-oxide minerals (K-

29

birnessite and hausmannite) are used. Results indicate the presence of protein adsorbed onto

30

mineral surfaces (BSA-Mn oxide associations) favors the AMPA (+20%) over the glycine

31

transformation pathway (-55%). The AMPA pathway is also favored in experiments conducted

32

at circumneutral pH. The shift in pathway selectivity corresponds to changes in bonding of

33

glyphosate with BSA-Mn oxide associations: we observe protein association enhances the

34

contribution of the mononuclear monodentate conformation of glyphosate at the Mn oxide

35

interface. In addition, protein association protects glyphosate from abiotic oxidation by

36

diminishing Mn oxide catalytic activity (occupies surface active sites) and by forming organic-

37

organic (i.e., glyphosate-protein) complexes. Furthermore, kinetic modeling shows protein

38

association hinders the adsorption, desorption and transformation rate constants under

39

circumneutral (pH 7.2) and acidic (pH 4.6) conditions. Since organo-mineral associations prevail

40

in natural and engineer systems, the observed shifts in glyphosate transformation pathways that

41

favor the formation of AMPA (a more toxic by-product) are relevant to human and ecosystem

42

health.

Introduction

Glyphosate is used to control many weeds.1 Due to its extensive use in agriculture,

46

horticulture, forestry, and urban environments, glyphosate is frequently detected in soils, water

47

bodies, food, and human fluids.2-11 Additionally, transformation of laundry additives in

48

wastewater (e.g., aminopolyphosphonates used as antiscalants) have been identified as a new

49

source of glyphosate in European rivers.12 Detection of glyphosate and its byproducts,

50

specifically aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), occurs despite their immobilization by

51

microorganisms, abiotic degradation, or retention on metal oxides in soils.13-19 Increased public

52

concern regarding its potential toxicity and presence in the environment underscores the

53

importance of research into its persistence and interactions within ecosystems.

54

Glyphosate primarily undergoes degradation through microbial activity, with additional

55

contributions from abiotic mechanisms, which remain poorly understood.20 Whether via biotic or

56

abiotic mechanisms (Scheme S1), the degradation of glyphosate may occur through C(2)-N bond

57

cleavage, which forms AMPA (AMPA pathway), a more toxic and resistant metabolite than

58

glyphosate;21-23 and/or through C(3)-P bond cleavage (sarcosine pathway), which yields

59

innocuous products (i.e., sarcosine and then glycine).16 A third degradation pathway (glycine

60

pathway; C(3)-N bond cleavage) has also been proposed due to the inability to detect

61

sarcosine.24-26 The abiotic transformation and persistence of glyphosate and its byproducts vary

62

significantly depending on environmental conditions. For example, the half-life (t1/2) of

63

glyphosate ranges widely across soils (t1/2 ≈ 2–174 days).19, 25, 27, 28 This variation is strongly

64

influenced by adsorption potential.2, 27 Clay-rich soils with high organic matter content and low

65

pH typically exhibit lower half-lives due to greater glyphosate adsorption. In a model water/Mn

66

oxide catalytic system, which is the most commonly used system in studies of glyphosate

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jp1qd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9497-9843 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

67

oxidation, glyphosate is notably unstable and degrades much faster (t1/2 ≈ 0.19 – 0.89 hr).26, 29, 30

68

Mn oxides are ubiquitous in soils and sediments, and highly redox-sensitive31, 32 although

69

fluctuation between oxic and anoxic conditions mainly impact Mn oxidation states in pore

70

waters.33, 34 Previous studies have shown that factors such as pH,29 temperature,16, 26, 35, 36 the

71

presence of oxyanions and metals,16, 36 redox conditions,16 solid-to-solution ratio,30, 37, 38 and

72

initial concentration29, 30 influence the catalytic activity of Mn oxides (predominantly birnessite)

73

and the associated rates of transformation and pathway selectivity in the abiotic oxidation of

74

glyphosate. Furthermore, different contribution of Mn valences (II, III and IV) impact the redox

75

potential and reactivity of Mn oxide interfaces for transformation and stabilization of organic

76

carbon.31, 33, 34, 39, 40 Although the abiotic degradation of glyphosate by birnessite (δ-Mn(III,IV) O2)

77

has been extensively studied15, 16, 24, 26, 30, 35, 37, 38, there is no study demonstrating how Mn oxides

78

with lower Mn valence states (i.e., hausmannite; Mn3(II,III) O4) may contribute to adsorption and

79

or degradation of glyphosate.

80

Dissolved organic matter (DOM), another critical component in environmentally relevant

81

systems, can also affect the oxidation of organic contaminants via interactions in solution or after

82

DOM adsorption onto mineral surfaces (i.e., after the formation of organo-mineral associations,

83

OMAs). Previous studies have shown the oxidation kinetics of phenolic compounds by Mn

84

oxides (birnessite) can change in the presence of soil or water derived DOM.41-45 For example,

85

Swenson et al.41 showed that slower degradation rates result from competitive sorption between

86

phenol and DOM coupled to reductive dissolution of birnessite. Conversely, they suggested that

87

the cross-coupling reactions at the surface of DOM-MnO2 association promote the degradation

88

of phenolic compounds where enhanced DOM association led to formation of DOM-phenoxy

89

radical species (via a one-electron-transfer between phenolic moieties of DOM and MnO2).41, 46

90

In other case, Liu et al.47 reported that a DNA macromolecule due to very high adsorption

91

affinity mainly via its backbone phosphate, can block active sites of MnO2 leading to suppressed

92

oxidation of fluorescent peroxidase substrates. The inhibitory impact of organic association also

93

is derived by surface passivation, where the pre-degradation of one organic constituent lower

94

abiotic degradation of another which is associated to the dissolution/reduction mechanism.48, 49

95

Proteinaceous materials derived from plant and microbial sources are a major active component

96

of DOM in soils, sediments and aquatic environments.50-54 Proteins have a high adsorption

97

affinity to diverse mineral surfaces, such as iron (oxy)hydroxides,55-58 layer aluminosilicates,59

98

manganese oxides48, 60-62 and other natural and engineered surfaces.63-65 Generally, proteins

99

unfold upon adsorption (e.g., loss of α-helices with conversion to turns), thus increasing the

100

overall adhesive strength by the addition of hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding that

101

leads to the formation of stable organo-mineral associations (OMAs).56, 59, 62, 63, 66 Surface

102

alteration by sorbed biomolecules may influence retention, transformation, and bioavailability of

103

other organic constituents in natural systems.14, 25, 48, 58, 67, 68 Although investigations of

104

glyphosate’s degradation on bare mineral surfaces are plentiful, the role of OMAs in governing

105

the dynamics of both sorption-desorption and transformation of xenobiotics like glyphosate

106

remains largely unexplored. Research utilizing heterogeneous organo-mineral associations will

107

help us acquire a more realistic perspective of glyphosate’s fate in the environment.

108

To address the identified knowledge gaps, we investigate the abiotic transformation pathways

109

and adsorption-desorption mechanisms and kinetics of glyphosate with protein-Mn oxide

110

associations. Experiments were conducted across minerals containing different Mn oxidation

111

states (II, III, and IV) and under environmentally relevant pH conditions (4.6 and 7.2). This

112

research employs in-situ time-resolved ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and microfluidic chamber

studies coupled with LC-MS and XPS analyses. Overall, Our findings reveal how glyphosate’s

114

interaction mechanism and its transformation pathways are tightly regulated by protein

adsorption on Mn oxide minerals.

118

Experiments were conducted using two Mn oxide minerals that differ in the Mn oxidation

119

states (K-birnessite, δ-MnO2 ; (K+)x(MnIIIMnIV)O2 ·y(H2O)) and hausmannite ( (MnIIMnIII2O4).

120

K-birnessite and hausmannite were synthesized as previously described69, 70 with some

121

modifications. Briefly, the synthesis of K-birnessite and hausmannite involves adding 2 M and 1

122

M KOH (Alfa Aesar, ≥ 99.98%) solutions to a 0.2 M MnCl2⸱4H2O (Alfa Aesar, ≥ 99.99%)

123

solution at room temperature, and vigorously stirring with O2 (flow ≈ 1.2 L min-1) or without

124

oxygenation, for ≈5hr, respectively. The precipitates were centrifuged and washed with DI water

125

(18.2 MΩ‧cm) to reach an electrical conductivity below 20 μS cm-1. The purified pellets are then

126

freeze-dried and stored in N2-purged containers at 5 C° for further experiments. XRD

127

diffractograms, TEM images, and physicochemical properties of synthesized Mn oxides are

128

shown in Figure S1 and Table S1, Supplementary Information (SI).

In-situ Time-resolved ATR-FTIR Adsorption-Desorption Experiments

130

In-situ time-resolved ATR-FTIR experiments were conducted to probe glyphosate adsorption-

131

desorption dynamics and mechanisms on K-birnessite and hausmannite thin films, with and

132

without pre-sorbed BSA protein, at pH 4.6 and 7.2. Experimental details can be found in our

previous work.14, 68 Briefly, 5 μL of K-birnessite or hausmannite from 1.4 or 2.7 g L-1

134

suspensions (respectively) were drop-cast on the diamond internal reflective element (diamond

135

IRE; area ≈ 7.1 mm2) of the ATR accessory (Pike GladiATR™; Pike Technologies Madison,

136

WI) and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. Based on the specific surface area of K-

137

birnessite and hausmannite minerals (Table S1, SI), the Mn oxide films deposited on the

138

diamond IRE had a similar total surface area (TSA ≈ 0.359 × 10-3 m2). At this low TSA, the IR

139

signals of expected byproducts (e.g., glycine and AMPA) were negligible compared to that of

140

glyphosate adsorbed at the surfaces. Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize the

141

concentration of influent glyphosate (C0) for in-situ ATR-FTIR experiments; a C0 = 2 mM was

142

used to obtain high spectral signal-to-noise ratio (>10). The adsorption step (i.e., Phase 1;

143

duration = 37 min) was followed by a desorption step (i.e., Phase 2; duration = 31 min) using 10

144

mM KCl supporting electrolyte solution at pH 4.6 and 7.2. FTIR spectra were collected over a

145

scan range of 4400 –150 cm-1 with an average 96 scans and resolution of 8 cm-1 (probing

146

interval = 0.8 min). BSA-Mn oxide associations were synthesized by running 7.5 μM BSA

147

protein over pre-conditioned Mn oxide films on the diamond IRE until equilibrium (see Text S5

148

and Figure S3 in SI for details). Experiments were repeated 3 – 4 times on freshly prepared films

149

under identical conditions. All in-situ experiments were conducted under nitrogen gas purging

150

and using an open-flow through system with a rate of 0.2 mLmin-1, controlled by a peristaltic

151

pump (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). ATR-FTIR spectra were collected on a Vertex 70 FTIR

152

spectrometer (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA). After collection, spectra received an atmospheric

153

compensation, a nine-point Savitsky-Golay smoothing and baseline correction. All post-hoc

154

manipulations were performed using OPUS v.7.2 software (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA).

155

Furthermore, the spectral features in the 1200 – 900 cm-1 range were deconvoluted in order to

156

determine the different interfacial configurations of adsorbed glyphosate through its phosphonate

157

group on Mn oxide and BSA-Mn oxide interfaces. Peak fitting of the spectra was carried out

158

using a second derivative deconvolution algorithm using PeakFit package v.4.12 (Systat

159

Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Details of this process can be found in our previous work.14

160

Kinetic Modeling of Glyphosate Adsorption-Desorption in in-situ ATR-FTIR Experiments

161

Adsorption and desorption kinetics of glyphosate on Mn oxide and BSA-Mn oxide interfaces

162

were estimated using the integral phosphonate frequency region (1200 to 910 cm -1; ν(PO)). As

163

mentioned before, the IR signal of other PO-containing species (i.e., AMPA and orthophosphate)

164

in in-situ ATR-FTIR experiments were negligible, and the evolution of ν(PO) vibrational modes

165

were assumed to originate from adsorption and desorption of glyphosate only. All surface-

166

associated reactions were well described by the modified pseudo-first-order model14, using Eq.

167

(1) for adsorption (Phase 1) and Eq. (2) for desorption (Phase 2):



168

where, A(ṽ)t is the integral ν(PO) absorbance at time t (min), A(ṽ)e is the predicted integral ν(PO)

169

absorbance at adsorption or desorption equilibria, te is an arbitrary time (i.e., when Phase 1 was

170

switched to Phase 2: te ≈ 37 min), and ka and kd are the adsorption and desorption rate constants

171

(min-1), respectively.

173

Time-resolved microfluidic experiments were conducted with workflow similar to in-situ

174

ATR-FTIR adsorption-desorption experiments to probe the dynamics of glyphosate’s

175

transformation and byproduct pathway selectivity on K-birnessite and hausmannite surfaces,

176

with and without pre-sorbed BSA protein, at pH 4.6 and 7.2. A polycarbonate microfluidic

177

chamber (w = 25 mm, l = 75 mm, and h = 0.24 mm) was fabricated for this study (Figure S2A).

178

Mn oxide surfaces were prepared by drop-casting mineral suspensions on microscope slides (i.e.,

179

Mn oxide chips; Figure S2B; w = 16 mm, l = 66 mm; area ≈ 1,716 mm2). The prepared Mn oxide

180

chips had approximately the same total surface area (TSA ≈ 0.235 m2). The experiments were

181

initiated by conditioning of the Mn oxide chips by introducing a 10 mM KCl supporting

182

electrolyte solution at pH 4.6 or 7.2 for 4 hr. Then, a glyphosate solution was introduced at a

183

flow rate of 0.2 mLmin-1 for 158 min (i.e., Phase 1). Phase 1 was followed by introducing the

184

same background electrolyte solution (i.e., Phase 2, desorption; duration = 122 min). To study

185

the impact of protein-Mn oxide associations on glyphosate transformations, BSA-Mn oxide

186

associations were synthesized by introducing a 30 μM BSA solution over pre-conditioned Mn

187

oxide chips for ≈ 2.5 hr. Then, to remove loosely bound protein molecules, the surface of BSA-

188

Mn oxide chips was conditioned again by passing the same background electrolyte solution at

189

corresponding pH values for ≈ 2 hr. All transformation experiments were performed using an

190

input concentration, C0, of 0.3 mM glyphosate in 10 mM KCl solution (I ≈ 10 mM) at pH 4.6

191

and 7.2. The effluents from the microfluidic chamber experiments were collected at 1.5 min time

192

intervals using an automatic fraction collector in a deep-well plate for further analyses.

The concentrations of glyphosate, AMPA, glycine and sarcosine were measured in the

195

effluents with a direct HILIC liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) method.71 The

196

instrumentation and details of the LC-MS methodology can be found in Text S1, SI. The

197

concentrations of orthophosphate72 and ammonium73 in the effluents were measured using

198

colorimetry. Total soluble Mn was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy.

199

Kinetic Modeling of Glyphosate Reactions on Mn Oxides in Microfluidic Experiments

200

To understand the extent of the adsorption, transformation and desorption reactions, and solute

201

transport in the microfluidic system, the following mass balance equation, representing the ideal

202

plug-flow reactor (PFR) model, was applied:

[Mass accumulation]=[In]-[Out]+[Generation]-[Consumption]

(3)

203

We used the ideal PFR model where there is a steady flow (Qin = Qout = 0.2 mLmin-1) with no

204

diffusion or dispersion across the boundaries. In Phase 1, the net input by advection was based

205

on the system’s response to a “step” input, where a constant input concentration (C0 = 0.3 mM)

206

was maintained over a period of time. In Phase 2, the system was evaluated with a “pulse” input,

207

where no input concentration (C0 = 0 mM) was applied, and the effluent concentration gradually

208

decreased to zero according to the system’s residence time distribution (τ). τ measured using a

209

Br- tracer test, was estimated at ≈2.45 min for the used microfluidic chamber (Figure S2C, SI).

210

The “consumption” by reaction term includes adsorption and/or transformation reactions, and the

211

“generation” by reaction term results from the formation and/or desorption reactions. Glyphosate

212

(GP) adsorption, and its transformation and generation of byproducts in effluents may include

two parallel-consecutive reactions, as described in Scheme 1. The first reaction (i.e., adsorption

214

of glyphosate) is reversible but the transformation reactions are irreversible.

215

Scheme 1. Proposed glyphosate adsorption (1) and transformation pathways (2) on Mn oxides.

216
217

For the sake of simplicity, the intermediate species amino methyl phosphonic acid (AMPA)

218

and its adsorption-desorption rate constants are not included in this scheme. Therefore, kr,3

219

reflects the combined effects of adsorption-desorption and transformation of AMPA. Within this

220

framework, the transformation rate expressions for glyphosate, glycine, AMPA, NH4+ and Pi can

221

be written as, Eqs. 1 – 5:

where, ka and kd are the adsorption and desorption rate constants (min-1) of glyphosate,

223

respectively. kr,1 and kr,2 are the transformation rate constants of glyphosate in the glycine and

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jp1qd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9497-9843 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

224

AMPA pathways, respectively, and kr,3 is the transformation rate constant of AMPA. The term

225

“GPads” denotes adsorbed glyphosate that is an intermediate in the transformation reactions. The

226

rate equation governing glyphosate adsorption processes is presented in Eq. 6:
rateGPads 

d [GPads ]
 ka [GP]  kd [GPads ]   kr ,1  kr ,2  [GPads ]
dt

(6)

227

To solve Eqs. 1 to 5, a steady-state approximation for d[GP]/dt can be applied, assuming that the

228

system undergoes a catalytic reaction, where the adsorption reaction is very slow in comparison

229

to transformation reactions of glyphosate: kr,1 or kr,2 >> ka. Consequently, there is no

230

accumulation of adsorbed glyphosate, or it remains relatively constant throughout the reaction

231

(i.e., d[GPads]/dt ≈0). The detailed derivation of the rate constants is provided in the Text S2, SI.

232

The selectivity for the AMPA pathway, SAMPA, can be expressed by Eq. 7:74

233

Transformation of small organic molecules, such as glyphosate, at Mn oxide surfaces can lead to

234

dissolution of the Mn oxide.16, 49, 75 Surface dissolution may be caused by adsorption-chelation or

235

redox processes that result in the formation of highly soluble Mn(II/III) complexes (i.e., Mn(II/III)-

236

GP).76. For either chelation or reductive dissolution mechanisms to occur, glyphosate needs to

237

form a coordinate bond with surface-associated Mn(II) or Mn(III) atoms49, 75, 77 as shown in

where kD is the ligand-promoted dissolution rate constant (min-1), inclusive of both chelation

and/or reductive dissolution reactions. Mn oxide dissolution may proceed along with or after

244

oxidation of glyphosate (Scheme 2) depending on the Mn valence state. We propose the

on Mn oxide is also associated with surface water loss. Adsorption of BSA is higher on

261

hausmannite than on K-birnessite, and also higher at pH 4.6 than 7.2, influenced by pH-

262

dependent electrostatic forces. No significant protein hydrolysis (i.e., break of C-N linkage) was

263

observed, as no band shifts or signal loss were detected for amide II during BSA coating and

264

stabilization (Figure S3B). Therefore, we do not expect any potential interference from BSA

265

breakdown on the surface of Mn oxides in this study.

266

The (de)protonation of glyphosate significantly affects its interactions at water/solid

267

interfaces.78 The predominant glyphosate species (>98%) at pH 4.6 and 7.2 are the monoanion [–

268

OOCCH2N+H2CH2-HPO3−] and dianion [–OOCCH2N+H2CH2-PO32−], respectively (Figure S4,

269

SI). Despite being a tridentate ligand, evidence increasingly suggests glyphosate’s carboxylate

270

and amine groups do not directly interact with goethite (i.e., do not form inner-sphere (IS)

271

complexes).14, 78-80 but form H-bonds (i.e., outer-sphere (OS) complexes) with other glyphosate

272

molecules at the goethite interface and with organic molecules in OMAs (e.g., with

273

polysaccharide in polysaccharide-goethite associations).14, 68

289

Asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrational modes of the carboxylate group of sorbed

290

glyphosate were subjected to downward shifts of 4 – 24 cm-1 on Mn oxides and BSA-Mn oxide

291

associations whereas interfacial δ(NH2+) vibrational modes were shifted to lower energies by 11

292

– 29 cm-1. Generally, hydrogen bonding lowers the frequency of stretching vibrations by

293

reducing the restoring force, while increasing the frequency of bending vibrations by introducing

294

an additional restoring force.81 Therefore, glyphosate’s amine groups do not contribute to H-

295

bonding in interfacial complexes (Figure 1B). Although downward shifts were observed to be

296

greater at pH 7.2 and in the presence of BSA, No specific trend was observed in interfacial

297

carboxylate-amine bands of glyphosate adsorbed on K-birnessite and hausmannite. This

298

highlights the fact that H-bonds do not from between glyphosate’s carboxylate and amine groups

299

and Mn oxides’ hydroxyl groups, and that H-bonds mainly occur in OS complexes (Figure 1B).

300

We observed that glyphosate and BSA molecules form a reversible guest-host association in bulk

301

solution via noncovalent interactions (Figure S5). This organic-organic interaction can impact

302

glyphosate adsorption by increasing surface mixing entropy and stabilized the interfacial

303

repulsive force due to formed H-bonds within glyphosate-BSA-Mn oxide association.

304

The negative progress in the IR signal intensity at ~1650 and ~1540 cm⁻¹ in BSA-Mn oxide

305

associations, corresponding to the amide I and II bands, indicates protein loss during glyphosate

306

adsorption and desorption (Figure 1A and S3B). Additionally, the reduction at ~1650 cm⁻¹ in all

307

experiments is linked to the formation of inner-sphere (IS) complexes (i.e., P-O-Mn bonds;

308

reaction (1) in Scheme 2) via phosphonate groups. This process results in the loss of surface

309

hydroxyl groups (≡Mn-OH) due to ligand-exchange reactions.40 IS complexes are identified by

310

the appearance of IR frequencies in the phosphonate region (1200 – 900 cm-1; ν(PO)). As

311

illustrated in Figure 1B, the phosphonate groups of glyphosate can form various IS complex

312

configurations, including mononuclear monodentate (MM), mononuclear bidentate (MB), and

313

binuclear bidentate (BB). Peak assignments and fitting for the various P-O-Mn configurations

314

are detailed in Figure S6 and Table S2. The relative absorbance of P-O-Mn vibrational modes

315

indicates that pH and protein associations influence the type of IS configuration glyphosate

316

forms or prefers (Figures 1A and S6). At pH 4.6, the simultaneous disappearance of the ν(POH)

317

band at 917 cm⁻¹ and the emergence of peaks at ~980 and ~930 cm⁻¹ signify the development of

318

bidentate BB and MB coordination modes, respectively (Table S2 and Figure S6). Additionally,

319

the appearance of a phosphonate stretching vibrational mode at ~1109 cm-1, along with the

320

ν(P=O) band at ~1130 cm-1, indicates the formation of an MM configuration78 (Figure S6). This

321

MM configuration more likely occur in the presence of BSA association at pH 4.6 and under

322

both BSA-associated and non-associated conditions at pH 7.2. Overall, these results indicate

323

weaker retention and a higher likelihood of glyphosate release from BSA-Mn oxide surfaces.

324

Kinetic modeling of adsorption and desorption was conducted using the integral area of the

325

ν(PO) bands; both processes were well described by the PFO kinetic model (Figure 1B). The

326

estimated PFO parameters for adsorption and desorption (Table 1) indicate BSA association

327

hinders the rate (ka) and extent (Ae) of adsorption, and slightly hinders the rate of desorption, kd.

328

The presence of BSA association had a greater effect on hausmannite than on K-birnessite

329

adsorption-desorption kinetics. Furthermore, with BSA association the ka values for each K-

330

birnessite and hausmannite become more similar at both pH (~0.16 – 0.17 and ~0.12 min-1,

331

respectively). This suggests BSA association is more important than pH in determining rate of

332

adsorption. Further, the presence of BSA association primarily diminished the intensities of

333

adsorbed glyphosate (15.2 – 28.5 %; Δν(PO)ads) at all conditions (Figure 1C and Table 1) this

334

reduction was greater at pH 7.2 (35.9 – 59.5 %) rather than pH 4.6 (15.2 – 28.5 %).

Glyphosate Oxidation on Mn oxides and BSA-Mn Oxide Associations

340

Breakthrough curves show the concentration of byproducts from glyphosate oxidation generally

341

follow the order: phosphate > glycine > AMPA > ammonium, with similar trends but lower

342

concentrations detected in experiments with hausmannite, and at pH 7.2 (Figure 2A and S7 and

343

Table S4). NH4+ was not detected with hausmannite. These results indicate that glycine is the

344

dominant byproduct from glyphosate oxidation (at least initially) although AMPA concentrations

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jp1qd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9497-9843 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

345

increase with time suggesting favorability for the AMPA pathway at later times. BSA association

346

significantly suppressed the formation of glycine on K-birnessite at pH 4.6 and 7.2 (Figure 2B

347

and Table S4). Estimated rate constants (Table 2) for glyphosate oxidation through the glycine

348

(kr,1) and AMPA (kr,2) pathways and AMPA degradation (kr,3) suggests glycine formation occurs

349

at the early stage of the transformation sequence, but the AMPA pathway is preferred at the late

350

stage. This is in good agreement with pervious work25, 26 where AMPA was found to be more

351

resistant to degradation compared to glyphosate. Furthermore, our preliminary in-situ adsorption-

352

desorption experiments confirm that AMPA can bind to the surface of K-birnessite via its

353

phosphonate groups (Figure S8). Therefore, lower AMPA concentrations detected in effluents

354

compared to glycine (Figure 2B), and low estimated kr,3 values may include the combined

355

effects of adsorption and degradation of AMPA.26 The rate of transformations on Mn oxides

356

follow the sequence: kr,1 >> kr,2 > kr,3. Notably, K-birnessite was able to degrade glyphosate with

357

faster rates than hausmannite (kr,1 and kr,2), especially at pH 7.2 (Table 2). BSA association

358

enhanced all the transformation rate constants (kr,1, kr,2 , and kr,3), except at pH 7.2 for kr,1

359

(birnessite and hausmannite) and for kr,3 (birnessite).

360

Selectivity for the AMPA pathway, as indicated by SAMPA (Table 2), increased in the presence

361

of BSA on K-birnessite at pH 4.6 (0.43 to 0.78) and 7.2 (0.23 to 0.47). However, the presence of

362

BSA on hausmannite did not have this effect, likely due to its greater standard reduction

363

potential (E0) that results in lower catalytic oxidation activity82, 83 (E0K-birnessite ≈ 1.23 V and

364

E0hausmannite ≈ 1.83 V).84 With increasing pH, in the absence or presence of BSA, corresponding

365

SAMPA values decreased and less AMPA was measured in collected effluents while glycine

366

remained the dominant byproduct (Figure 2B and Table 2 and S4). Lasty, K-birnessite showed

conditions.

Integration of XPS results (Figure S5 and Table S4) with measured soluble Mn in the effluents

382

reveals that dissolution of Mn oxide by glyphosate is predominately due to chelation dissolution

383

mechanism at pH 4.6 (Figure 3). And this reaction is mainly governed by pH since no dissolved

384

Mn was detected in collected effluents at pH 7.2. Reductive dissolution of Mn oxides, specially

385

hausmannite, is a less significant mechanism, as the measured dissolved Mn does not show 1:1

386

proportional correlation with transformation byproducts (i.e., correspond to one-electron transfer

387

reaction, Scheme 1). On the other hand, glyphosate and dissolved Mn in the effluents show

388

1:0.75 ratio which is respond to a chelation mechanism. In the presence of BSA association the

389

extent of dissolution on Mn oxides diminishes and the glyphosate to dissolved Mn ratio is 1:0.55.

390

As previously suggested, protein fragmentation is a catalyzed hydrolysis reaction and not an

391

oxidative one62 (as is the case with other organic molecules, such as glyphosate), in which Mn

392

oxide do not reduce by BSA to Mn (II) or (III) and further loaded BSA blocks the active sites

393

that subsequently protects the surface from being dissolved or reduced by glyphosate.85, 86

394

However, the dissolution rate constant (kD) is greater at the presence of BSA association (Table

395

2). This result may be associated with mixing entropy effect.

401
402

It has been suggested that soluble Mn (more likely Mn(II) species) can decrease the oxidative

403

reactivity of glyphosate16, and phenolic contaminants41, 87 at the surface of Mn(IV) oxides. This

404

occurs because (i) Mn(II) occupy active sites when sorbed, and (ii) Mn(II) can lower the redox

405

potential of the system. As shown by quantitative XPS analysis (Table S5), increases in the

406

Mn(II) fraction at the K-birnessite surface indicate reduced Mn(II) was re-adsorbed, as suggested

407

by previous work.41, 88, 89 This process may led to surface passivation.88, 89 Furthermore, the

408

adsorption of by-products such as Pi and AMPA may inhibit the reaction. These interactions

409

suggest Mn(II) species, either in solution or at the surface, can modulate contaminant

410

transformation, affecting the persistence and breakdown of agrochemicals like glyphosate in soil

411

environments.

Glyphosate Bonding in Relation to Its Transformations

We observed that the glyphosate bonding configuration at the surface of Mn oxides

414

significantly impacts subsequent C-N bond cleavage and transformation pathways. A positive

415

strong correlation was identified between SAMPA and the selectivity for mononuclear monodentate

416

(MM) coordination complexes (i.e., SMM, see Text S6 for details) (Figure 4). The results indicate

417

that the AMPA transformation pathway may govern by the type of bond glyphosate forms at Mn

418

oxide surfaces over time. In particular, BSA association promoted the formation of MM

419

complexes, which subsequently favored the AMPA pathway. The slopes of the lines in Figure 4

420

reflect the rate of favorability for selective transformation of glyphosate via the AMPA pathway,

421

with steeper slopes indicating greater favorability. Overall, the formation of AMPA was more

422

favorable at the surface of K-birnessite compared to hausmannite. Additionally, surface

423

modifications, including decreasing pH and the presence of BSA association, further increased

424

the favorability (i.e., steeper slopes) for the AMPA pathway. In contrast, hausmannite exhibited a

425

limited tendency for SAMPA transformation compared to K-birnessite at similar SMM values.

426

These results highlight how surface type and environmental conditions impact glyphosate

427

bonding configurations at Mn oxide surfaces, dictating C-N bond cleavage and subsequent

428

transformation pathways.

Environmental Implications

437

While natural organic matter and Mn oxides are abundant33, 90 and pivotal to contaminant

438

fate41, the catalytic role of organo-mineral associations (e.g., protein-Mn oxide) in glyphosate

439

transformation remains underexplored. This study fills a critical gap, demonstrating the critical

440

role of organo-mineral associations in the abiotic transformation of glyphosate and enable us to

441

estimate glyphosate bioavailability and long-range transport in redox-sensitive environments. In

442

this study, we demonstrated that in the presence of protein association or with increasing pH,

443

both the transformation rate and capacity of glyphosate on BSA-Mn oxide associations diminish.

444

Additionally, a shift in glyphosate’s abiotic transformation pathways may occur due to changes

445

in its inner-sphere configurations. We demonstrated that the formation of monodentate

446

complexes via phosphonate groups enhances the favorability of the AMPA pathway leading to

447

increased production of AMPA, a toxic by-product, particularly at BSA-birnessite interface.

448

Conversely, at lower pH or in the absence of BSA association, the formation of bidentate

449

complexes is favored on Mn oxides, resulting in greater selectivity for the glycine pathway,

450

which is a nutritional by-product. However, the glycine pathway is the predominant

451

transformation pathway, while the sarcosine pathway, as in other studies, was not identified.25, 26

452

Shifts in transformation pathways and their dynamics are critical for health and ecosystems, as

453

DOM from various sources can enter natural systems, influencing both interfacial and organic-

454

organic interactions of organic contaminants and nutrients. Overall, This research enhances

455

understanding of organic contaminant behavior (e.g., glyphosate) at redox-active organo-mineral

456

interfaces, where surface interactions govern retention, transport, bioavailability, and

457

transformation in agricultural and engineered systems, offering insights for sustainable soil

458

management and pollution mitigation strategies.
