Understanding historical chemical usage is crucial for assessing current and past impacts on
human health and the environment and informing future regulatory decisions. However, past
monitoring data is often limited in scope and number of chemicals, while suitable sample
types are not always available for remeasurement. Data-driven cheminformatics methods on
patent and literature data oﬀer several opportunities to ﬁll this gap. The chemical stripes were
developed as an interactive, open source tool for visualising patent and literature trends over
time, inspired by the global warming and biodiversity stripes. This paper details the underlying
code and datasets behind the visualisation, with a major focus on the patent data sourced
from PubChem, including patent origins, uses, and countries. Overall trends and specific
examples are investigated in greater detail to explore both the promise and caveats that such
data offers in assessing the trends and patterns of chemical patents over time and across
different geographic regions. Despite a number of potential artefacts associated with patent
data extraction, the integration of cheminformatics, statistical analysis, and data visualisation
tools can help generate valuable insights that can both illuminate the chemical past and
potentially serve towards an early warning system for the future.

While studying historical and current chemical exposures can provide insights into their
health and environmental impacts, the re-creation of historical exposures to investigate past,
present or future health effects using analytical data is severely limited by several factors.
These include the past focus on only a few dozen target chemicals (primarily legacy
pollutants), in many cases a lack of suitable historical samples for remeasurement with
modern analytical methods, as well as the sheer immensity of chemical space under
consideration. Patent data, accessible through platforms like the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and linked to chemical structures in open databases such as PubChem1,
offers an alternative data-mining approach for examining past and potential chemical
exposures, even though a mention in a patent does not always equate the use of a chemical.

PubChem is an open database of chemical structures, properties and associated information,
providing tools for searching and analysing chemical information1. Approximately 40 million
of the 118 million compounds in PubChem (June 2024) are linked to ~51 million patent files2.
This Google Patents dataset covers 120 million patent publications from >100 patent offices
including the European (EPO), Japanese (JPO), Korean (KIPO) and US patent offices (USPTO)
plus WIPO. Each patent record provides details on the chemicals referenced in that patent,
along with patent title, abstract, application and publication dates, applicant, inventor, and
patent classification, but without context about why particular chemicals are mentioned.
Individual PubChem compound pages contain information about each patent linked to that
compound (chemical) in the Patent subsection. A single invention may be described across
multiple patent documents (e.g., patent applications, grants, and re-examination certificates)
identified with a unique patent identifier suffixed with a code (e.g., A1, A2, B1, B2). The same
patent may also be filed in multiple national agencies, which can be grouped together into
patent families.

Patent data has been used to prioritize compounds in non-target environmental studies in a
complementary manner to literature counts, aiding in the identification of potential
contaminants with known commercial uses3. A recent viewpoint highlighted a concerning
upward trend in chemical numbers across databases over time frames much shorter than the
typical time for regulatory actions4. The chemical stripes visualisation included in that

viewpoint4 sparked extensive debate, drawing significant attention, feedback and questions
from various audiences. The subsequent sonification5 and accompanying video6 by J. Perera
further intensified the discussion, leaving viewers in a state of shock or deep contemplation.
Combining international legislation, patent filing dates and region information could
potentially reveal various trends in patent numbers, as well as the effectiveness of regulatory
measures and the necessity for timely interventions. However, beyond the general upward
trend in chemical and patent numbers, deviating patterns in the stripes visualisation were
observed for various chemicals, while several potential artefacts and limitations became
apparent. This feedback motivated this article, which presents the data, code and methods
behind the chemical stripes visualisation and corresponding chemicalStripes R package7 and
performs a more detailed analysis of the patent data in PubChem for this particular context,
closing with a discussion on the potential and limitations of this data.

Chemical Stripes Visualisation
The open source chemicalStripes7 R package is available on GitLab and was developed to
create the chemical stripes figure for one or more specific chemicals by PubChem Compound
IDs (CIDs). The default is a single CID (Figure 1A), while multiple chemical forms (e.g. salts,
stereoisomers) can be handled by inputting multiple CIDs to form summarized stripes (Figure
1B). CIDs can be obtained easily from multiple starting queries using PubChem search
functionality8. In addition to the input CID(s), users can specify a date range (default 19602023), mode (patent or literature) and opt for a colourblind friendly version. The patent data
is retrieved from the “Depositor Supplied Patent Identifiers” section9 of the respective CIDs,
while the literature data is retrieved from the “Consolidated References” section10. The
default colour range is green through yellow to red (Figure 1A, C, D), reproducing a trafficlight scheme distinctive from both the warming11 and biodiversity stripes12 already produced,
whereas the colourblind friendly version is blue to red (Figure 1B), very similar to the warming
stripes (and hence not the preferred default). The chemical stripes function begins by
checking package dependencies and loading necessary libraries. It then retrieves compound
information, including the compound name, molecular formula, and number of patents ﬁled.
If patent data is available, this is then downloaded and processed, generating the stripe plot
using the ggplot2 package13, both displaying and saving the output as PNG, see examples in
Figure 1. For further details see the chemicalStripes repository7.

Since a general trend was obvious (Figure 1A, B) with clear outliers (C), the patent dataset was
analysed in more detail (the literature dataset is much smaller and currently less suitable for
these more detailed investigations). Time series clustering was performed to systematically
identify outliers, inspired by examples such as the abrupt decrease in patents for gallopamil
(Figure 1C). Region-based analysis was performed by inventor region to identify chemicals
exclusive to certain regions, or regions with similar patenting activities, while specific trends
related to chemical classes such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides or persistent compounds like
per-and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) were also explored. Additionally, network analysis
was employed to uncover relationships and connectivity patterns among chemicals in the
patent dataset. Speciﬁcally, several centrality measures were utilized to assess the
importance or inﬂuence of chemicals within the constructed network, despite their
dependency on speciﬁc context and sensitivity to small changes in network structure. Further
details are available as open source code in the ULPatentTrends15 repository.

Since the patent dataset in PubChem is huge (>4 TB of data), subsets were used to perform
these analyses. Distinct topics of interest to the environmental community were chosen to
explore further, including legacy pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs), agrochemicals
(generally data-rich chemicals) and emerging pollutants of concern (bisphenols and their
alternatives, plus PFAS). Curated lists of chemicals (often called “suspect lists”) were extracted
from online resources, including the NORMAN Suspect List Exchange (NORMAN-SLE)16–18,
CompTox19–21, the PubChem PFAS Tree22,23 and the PubChem Compound Table of Contents
(TOC) Tree2 in the PubChem Classification Browser. The agrochemical lists included the
“Agrochemical Information”, “EU Pesticides Data” and “USDA Pesticides Program” sections
from the PubChem TOC Tree2 and the S28 EUBIOCIDES24 list from the NORMAN-SLE. The
bisphenol lists included S20 BISPHENOLS25 and the alternatives list S97 UBABPAALT26 from
the NORMAN-SLE, while a polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) list was extracted from
CompTox27. For PFAS these included the PFAS considered in the PARC project28,29 (S102
PARCPFAS30) and potential persistent, mobile, toxic (PMT) PFAS (S111 PMTPFAS31) from the

Overall and Regional Trends by Chemical Lists
Information was available for 103 separate regions, with most data generally available for the
US, Europe, Japan, China, Korea and WIPO; the ﬁrst 5 were chosen for a more detailed
regional analysis. One example plot showing the top 20 of the 103 regions is shown in Figure
S1; additional plots are included in the ULPatentTrends repository15. The overall trends in
patent numbers over the diﬀerent lists broken down by the ﬁve largest regions (with all
others, including world, in the “other” category) reveal varying trends, with six of the thirteen
examples shown in Figure 2 and explained below. More examples are given in the Supporting
Information (SI) Figures S2-S6, including some breakdowns per CID, and in ULPatentTrends15.

The overall trends in the entire Agrochemicals category (Figure 2A) and the two EU and US
subsets (SI Figure S2B&C) were quite similar, although the increase in patents from China was
less pronounced for the US compared with the EU and overall agrochemical list. A slightly
diﬀerent pattern was observed for EUBIOCIDES (Figure 2B). Figure S3, a breakdown by
compound, shows that this is driven primarily by benzoic acid, propanol and isopropanol.
Further breakdowns per CID are included in ULPatentTrends15. The pattern for S20
BISPHENOLS (Figure 2C) and the alternatives list, S97 UBABPAALT, were almost identical,
dominated by Bisphenol A (see Figure S4). The plot for CompTox PCBs (Figure 2D) reveals a
markedly diﬀerent pattern with a peak around 2001, potentially due to the impact of the
Stockholm Convention signed in 2001 (eﬀective 2004) – details by CID are given in Figure S5.
This baseline is mainly 2-chlorobiphenyl, with 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl and 3,3',4,4'-

tetrachlorobiphenyl forming the peak around 2000 (see Figure S5). The diﬀerence in patent
trends for the initial versus updated PFOA listings in the Stockholm Convention (Figure 2E vs.
F), particularly in the last years (2009-2022), underscore the critical importance of updating
regulatory lists, especially in light of the increasing proportion of Chinese patents. Regional
plots for all six PFAS lists are included in Figure S6.

Discovering Important Chemicals in Lists via Centrality Analysis
Networks were constructed for CIDs from the chemical lists. Each (weighted) individual
network consisted of the CIDs from a speciﬁc list as nodes. An edge connecting a pair of CIDs
was established if both CIDs were mentioned by one patent. Each edge was further weighted
by the number of co-appearances of the two CIDs in patents. These individual networks
resulted in plots (see Figures S7-8 and ULPatentTrends15 for examples) that were quite
diﬃcult to interpret. More detailed network analysis, shown in Figure 3 (including the US in
Figures S9) helped isolate chemicals of particular interest to certain regions.

Figure 3 shows a patent network analysis of the S111 PMTPFAS list, with nodes represented
by their degree centrality for China (A) and Europe (B), and their PageRank centrality for China
(C) and Europe (D), each featuring the top 25 nodes. This analysis highlights diﬀerences in
regional patent activity related to key PFAS compounds. In plots A, B, and C, the top candidate
is tetraﬂuoroborate (CID 26255, see Figure 3E, top left, “+” symbol), which is used for
electroplating and as an electrolyte additive for batteries. In the EU PageRank Centrality plot,
it ranks only 5th, indicating a relatively lower number of patent applications involving this
compound or within this sector compared to other regions or compounds. In plot D, the top
compound is triﬂuoroacetic anhydride (TFAA, CID 9845, “*” in Figure 3E), which is second
highest in A and B, third in C. TFAA serves as a recommended desiccant for triﬂuoroacetic acid

(CID 6422, “^”), which is fourth in A and second in C, but is less prominent in Europe (B) and
absent in D. Triﬂuoroethanol (CID 6409, “°”), a solvent used in organic chemistry, ranks third
in A and B, second in D, and seventh in C. Fluometuron (CID 16562, sideways “§”), a herbicide,
is second in D, tenth in C, and lower in both A and B. Lactofen (CID 62276, “-“), another
herbicide, appears consistently across A, C and D, but is missing in B. PFOA (CID 9554, “X”), a
well-known PFAS compound restricted by the Stockholm Convention since 2019, is present in
all four plots, highest in Figure 3C (4th place). The diﬀerences between the plots underscore
how regulatory environments, industrial needs, and research priorities shape the patenting
activities related to PFAS compounds in the EU and China (and US - see Figure S9). The
presence of compounds like PFOA in both regions highlights ongoing attention to regulated
substances, but the speciﬁc applications and frequency of patent ﬁlings reveal divergent
technological focuses and market demands between the two regions. A similar analysis for
agrochemicals is included in the SI, Figure S10. Both examples show how investigating the
patent data on various lists of chemicals could help isolate “stand-out” trends in chemical
activity and act as (or help support) a potential early warning system for up and coming action.

The regional analysis of the patent dataset (see Figures S9&10) included CIDs that are unique
to speciﬁc regions, such as agrochemicals present only in China, Europe or the US, or those
unique to only two regions, such as China and Europe but not US. The analysis covering all
possible regional subsets and can be found in ULPatentTrends15; custom queries can be
formed from the CID lists. Examples for the agrochemical list are given in the TOC graphic.

Potential and Limitations of Patent Data
There are several challenges and limitations associated with analysing the chemical stripes
visualizations and patent dataset. The patent dataset, while comprehensive, may not always
be current or complete and seems to contain historical depositions that have been
discontinued (potentially partially explaining some “blips” seen around 2007 and 2016),
posing signiﬁcant hurdles for accurate data (and trend) analysis. Extracting chemical
information via image recognition or text mining from patents is challenging, since older
patent documents are lower quality and are thus quite noisy and error prone37. The dataset
in PubChem is reliant on the information provided by depositors and is mapped to CIDs during
deposition based on the data received. Often, chemicals mentioned in the introduction of
patents are not actually used in the application, leading to potential misinterpretation of their
relevance, while any chemicals that happen to appear in Markush structures deﬁned for drug
discovery purposes may be overrepresented. Chemicals can be mistakenly identiﬁed due to
their appearance in unrelated contexts, such as being part of an inventor's name. Such an
error, reported for the 1913 patent linked to PFOS (US-1257524-A), based on a ﬁgure in the
earlier viewpoint, led to a suggestion to use a higher threshold in the cut-oﬀ applied to the
scoring of name recognition in future applications. The two earliest PFOS patents currently in
PubChem (as of 29 June 2024) are due to misrecognised names: US-1257524-A was invented
by Adolf Pfoser, while US-2290705-A was invented by Wilhelm Pfost – the ﬁrst genuine PFOS
patent is 1953 (see Figure S11). Additionally, recent patents for PFOS may, for example, reﬂect
new treatment technology, not PFOS production or use. The tabular view of the patent data
in PubChem allows a quick check of the linked patents, assisting with rapid veriﬁcation (see
Figure S12); this can also be downloaded for oﬄine use.

The timeliness of patent data is a major issue. Patent records from recent years, particularly
post-2020, are often incomplete, which can skew analysis and trends; it can take 1-2 years for
the data to ﬁlter through more completely. This is exacerbated by the use of the “priority
date”, which can add an 18 month delay from ﬁling, but is the preferred date for the majority
of PubChem users. This gap highlights the need for rapid updates of data sources to ensure
that recent innovations and ﬁlings are accurately represented. The accuracy of the dataset is
heavily reliant on the eﬃciency and precision of literature mining and image recognition
algorithms, which is an area of active research37–40. Adjustments to the extraction workﬂows
can result in the exclusion of several patents from the dataset or the omission of information
such as priority dates (which, if absent, cannot be included in the chemical stripes).

246
247
248
249

Future research directions could include exploring diﬀerent patent sources, such as using AI
applications such as DeepSearch by IBM to collect and curate documents, which may oﬀer
more reliable and comprehensive data. Reﬁning the data mining tools would also help in
managing and interpreting the patent dataset more eﬀectively.

The chemical stripes package (ChemicalStripes7) and Jupyter notebooks (ULPatentTrends15)
provided as part of this work are designed to help environmental researchers explore the
possibilities of using patent data to address their environmental questions. This will help
facilitate a deeper understanding of regional trends, regulatory impacts, and innovation
landscapes in the chemical sector, as well as limitations in this data. Users are encouraged to
report any artefacts, since such feedback is crucial for reﬁning the dataset and approaches.41
Incorporating more sophisticated classiﬁcation methods in data extraction may help further
enhance the accuracy and usability of this data in the future.
