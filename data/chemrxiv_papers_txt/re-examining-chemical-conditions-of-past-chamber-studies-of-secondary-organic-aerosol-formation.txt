Abstract

29

The simulation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in 3D models generally relies on
measurements made in laboratory chamber studies. However, many of the laboratory studies that
underpin the aerosol parameterizations used in these models were carried out more than fifteen
years ago, before recent developments in our understanding of peroxy radical (RO2) chemistry
and its role in aerosol formation. As a result, limitations of past chamber experiments and the
incomplete understanding of their chemical conditions (e.g., the initiating oxidants, RO2 fate),
may skew SOA representation in models. In this work, literature SOA chamber studies,
specifically those referenced by the SOA scheme in the GEOS-Chem global model, are
simulated using a modified version of the Master Chemical Mechanism. This enables explicit
estimation of typically-unconstrained parameters which affect experimental outcomes, including
the relative importance of different oxidants, and the relative loss of RO2 to different
unimolecular and bimolecular processes. This work demonstrates that reaction conditions are
dynamic, changing within and between experiments, and that many experimental conditions
involve more than one oxidant or RO2 fate, complicating model parameterizations. However, we
also find that RO2 isomerization is important under many of the experimental conditions used,
meaning that some RO2 isomerization processes are to some extent embedded into 3D model
SOA estimates, despite no explicit representation of this chemistry.

Introduction

35

Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed from the oxidation and subsequent condensation of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is the major component of organic aerosol in the
atmosphere1,2 and therefore substantially impacts the climate and contributes to air pollution.
However, organic aerosol has long posed a challenge for 3D models, which typically do not
accurately predict its observed variability,3,4 likely due to the complexities and uncertainties
associated with the formation of SOA.

SOA formation is strongly influenced by key branch points in the chemical oxidation
mechanism, each of which operate as a function of reaction conditions.5 Two of the most
important branch points are the identity of the initiating oxidant and the fate of the resulting
peroxy radical. VOCs are most commonly oxidized by OH, O3, or NO3, and these different
oxidation pathways can affect SOA yield. For example, the reaction of isoprene with OH often
results in relatively rapid incorporation of oxygen into the molecule, reducing volatility, while
the reaction of isoprene with O3 fragments the carbon chain, resulting in two oxidized but more
volatile products. The oxidation of a VOC typically results in the formation of a peroxy radical
(RO2), a second key branch point that controls the distribution of potential products. Under a
conventional understanding of RO2 chemistry, RO2 species typically react with NO, forming an
alkoxy radical or organonitrate, or HO2, forming an organic peroxide.5 RO2 species can also
react with other RO2, forming disproportionation or dimer products, and some RO2 may react
with NO2, forming peroxyacyl nitrates, or with NO3, forming alkoxy radicals.6 These different
RO2 fates can affect SOA yields, for example by favoring fragmentation (yielding higher
volatility products) or incorporation of additional oxygen atoms (yielding lower volatility
products).
However, advances in our understanding of RO2 chemistry over the last fifteen years have
brought to light several new RO2 reaction pathways. In particular, peroxy radical isomerization,
sometimes referred to as autoxidation, has been recognized as an important pathway through
which oxygen may sequentially be incorporated into an organic molecule, rapidly forming a lowvolatility compound that may condense to efficiently contribute to SOA mass.7,8 RO2
isomerization rates are highly dependent on the structure of the RO2 species, varying over many
orders of magnitude, such that for some compounds, it may be a dominant RO2 fate, while for
others it may be irrelevant.9 While additional RO2 reactions such as the rapid formation of
ROOR species by RO2 + RO210 or the reaction of RO2 with OH11 have also been discovered in
recent years, the importance of these for atmospheric SOA formation is not yet clear.
The formation of SOA is sufficiently complex such that its explicit modeling on a regional and
global scale is prohibitive. SOA forms through the condensation of numerous products of VOC
oxidation, each of which is derived from a different complicated (and incompletely understood)
sequence of oxidation reactions, and each of which differ in vapor pressure and reactivity. In
order to make this process computationally tractable, 3D models rely on substantial
simplifications. In the simplest case, SOA is treated as a fixed yield product of the reaction or

emission of VOC precursors.3,12 However, SOA is more realistically represented when
absorptive partitioning of gas-phase organic species into the organic aerosol phase is
considered,13 typically through the use of the two-product model14 or volatility basis set (VBS).15
In either case, yields of surrogate species of different volatilities are assigned by fitting the
laboratory-measured SOA yield as a function of the organic aerosol concentration (cOA), thereby
linking laboratory results to 3D model output. While SOA yields in a VBS scheme can be
defined simply based on the identity of the VOC precursor, they may also be specified based on
VOC/oxidant pairs, or NOX-conditions (“high NOX” and “low NOX”), such that aerosol yields in
the model can be defined for different chemical environments. Within this framework, aerosol
yields may be parameterized such that under intermediate chemical conditions (e.g., competing
RO2 + NO and RO2 + HO2 reactions), SOA yields may be linearly interpolated.16–18
Because SOA parameterizations fundamentally rely on laboratory chamber experiments, they
therefore integrate any limitations from these experiments. Many limitations of chamber
experiments have been documented previously, including large differences between atmospheric
and chamber temperature, humidity, and NOX concentrations,19 as well as the partitioning of
semi-volatile and low-volatility species to chamber walls, a process which impacts observed
aerosol formation.20 An important additional limitation is that the chemical conditions used in
past chamber experiments are not typically well-characterized.21 Many laboratory chamber
studies that continue to be used as a basis for regional and global model aerosol modules were
carried out more than fifteen years ago, before the previously-discussed advances in our
understanding of RO2 chemistry (e.g., isomerization). Earlier chamber experiments were not
designed to study these unimolecular reaction pathways, and instead focused on separating
aerosol yield by reaction with specific oxidants, and/or by “high-NOx” vs “low-NOX” pathways.
Furthermore, while assessments of RO2 and oxidant fate in contemporary chamber experiments
using mechanistic modeling is increasingly common, it was much less common in older studies.
Instead, oxidant and RO2 fate was often assumed based on the oxidant added or the initial NOX
concentrations, and any such assumptions are subsequently embedded in aerosol
parameterizations. While contemporary model schemes rely on a range of laboratory studies,
they often pull from some of the same older experiments; commonly referenced collections of
volatility basis set fits include Pye et al.,18 Farina et al.,12 and Zhang et al.22
Given our evolving understanding of radical chemistry, the chemical conditions as reported in
older publications and the chemical conditions actually used in those experiments may not
always align. Where an aerosol parameterization relies on assigned RO2 conditions (e.g., reaction
with NO vs. reaction with HO2), any deviation in the true experimental RO2 fate from this binary
classification (which may arise from the importance of other reactions such as isomerization or
RO2 + RO2) may affect the accuracy of the aerosol scheme. Similarly, oxidation processes may
differ from an assumption of a single dominant oxidant, as multiple oxidants may be formed
(e.g., OH from O3 + alkene reactions, O3 or NO3 from irradiated VOC + NOX mixtures). These
effects may be unexpected, for example where these processes are influenced by trace
background NOX or by the chemistry associated with added compounds (e.g., OH scavengers).

This work seeks to re-examine chamber conditions used in literature SOA experiments, by using
explicit box modeling to estimate typically-unconstrained chemical parameters. The specific
focus here is on the initiating oxidant and the fate of RO2 radicals, which to our knowledge have
never been systematically assessed in past SOA chamber studies. The set of historical chamber
experiments examined is taken from the basis for the “Complex” aerosol scheme18 from GEOSChem, a widely used chemical transport model. This scheme describes SOA formation in terms
of both oxidant and RO2 fate, and therefore represents an appropriate study to use as a guide for
the selection of experiments. While this set of experiments is not a comprehensive list, it
includes chamber studies that form a basis for aerosol schemes in other 3D models, such that the
results of this work may be more broadly applicable. Chamber experiments are represented using
explicit chemical mechanisms, modified where possible to include appropriate isomerization
reactions. Finally, explicitly modeled oxidant and RO2 fate are interpreted in the context of their
use in aerosol parameterizations, giving insight into challenges facing experimental design and
the creation of accurate parameterizations.

Historical experiments are chosen based on Pye et al.,18 the basis for the “Complex” aerosol
scheme used in GEOS-Chem. While subsequent studies have updated the aerosol module to
include aqueous reactive uptake of isoprene oxidation products and some organonitrates
separately from the volatility basis set,23,24 that work is not considered here. The publications
covered in this work are shown in Table 1, along with basic experimental details and a brief
summary of data availability. Starting experimental conditions (NOX levels, VOC levels, etc.) are
provided in each publication, and experimental timeseries are scraped from paper figures or
provided by authors. All model parameters for each simulation are shown in Tables S.1 and S.2.

Each experiment is classified into one of six categories (last column of Table 1) based on the
oxidation conditions. While chamber experiments are often grouped simply as “high-NOX” or
“low-NOX,” these distinctions do not fully describe the underlying chemistry or RO2 fate.25
Experiment categories involving added NOX include “HONO” (which use HONO as an oxidant
precursor26,27), “H2O2, NOX” (which use both H2O2 and added NOX26,28), and “traditional
photooxidation” (which use a mixture of VOC, NOX, and UV light29). Experiments using VOC,
NOX, UV light, and added O330 are also grouped into this category based on similarities in the
observed chemistry. Experiment categories involving no added NOX include “H2O2, low NOX,”
28,27,26
and “O3, low NOX”.29,31 In all ozonolysis experiments studied here, an OH scavenger is
added to minimize OH oxidation of the precursor. Ozonolysis experiments from Zhang et al.30
are classified as “O3, some NOX” since these experiments featured measurable background NOX
concentrations of 2 – 15 ppb (sufficiently high to substantially alter observed chemistry).

Modeling is carried out using the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling, version 4.3
(F0AM).32 Chemical mechanisms are taken from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM
v3.3.1).33,34,34–37 While referenced by Pye et al.,18 α-humulene and naphthalene are not modeled
since they are not represented in the MCM. Similarly, experiments focusing on the reaction of
NO3 with β-pinene29 and isoprene38 are also omitted due to insufficient experimental data to
constrain the model. Only gas-phase chemistry is modeled, with no treatment of partitioning or
particle-phase chemistry.

Model parameters for each experiment are included in Tables S.1 and S.2.

While some mechanisms in the MCM, most notably for isoprene, include unimolecular RO2
reactions, most mechanisms used here do not yet feature unimolecular RO2 chemistry. While
RO2 isomerization rates are highly dependent on structure9 and challenging to accurately
measure or calculate, some important isomerization rates have been characterized or estimated
for all of the precursor VOCs studied. Mechanisms are therefore modified to include known or
estimated RO2 isomerization rate constants for initial RO2, defined here as the first RO2 species
formed immediately after the VOC-oxidant reaction (these species are listed in Table S.3); all
other RO2 are referred to as “subsequent” RO2. We note that because a single generation of
oxidation can include multiple RO2 species formed in sequence, “initial RO2” is not synonymous
with “first-generation RO2.” Due to the extensive uncertainties and complexities of integrating
unimolecular RO2 reactions into chemistry that occurs beyond the initial RO2 species, reactions
for subsequent RO2 are not modified. To conserve carbon without extensively re-writing each
mechanism, each RO2 isomerization reaction forms an alkyl radical, which reacts with oxygen to
form another RO2 radical, identical to an RO2 species from a later point in the mechanism. RO2
isomerization rate constants are taken from literature measurements and calculations.9,39–44

Mechanism modifications are applied to all precursor mechanisms (except that of isoprene,
which already features isomerization reactions), and are detailed in Table S.4 and Section S.1.
Some experiments use additional VOCs such as radical promoters (propene),29 which facilitate
additional OH formation through ozonolysis, OH scavengers (2-butanol, n-butanol),29–31 which
decrease OH concentrations to maximize O3 chemistry, or hydrocarbons (n-pentane),30 which are
used to dilute the precursor VOC for injection. These species are represented by a standard
mechanism from the MCM and an identical non-interacting tracer mechanism that is run in
parallel with the main simulation. This allows the subtraction of the influence of these species
during analysis, such that analysis focuses solely on the chemistry of the VOC of interest.
All experiments are first modeled based on known parameters. While the publications vary in
specificity with regard to reported conditions, they generally report initial VOC, O3, and NOX
concentrations (See Tables S.1 and S.2 for a summary of all model input parameters). Less well
quantified starting material concentrations include H2O2 (typically estimated) and OH radical
sinks (e.g. 2-butanol concentration is “sufficient to consume OH” 29). Light spectra are taken
from earlier publications for indoor chambers45,46 (See Figure S.1). Experiment length is rarely
stated explicitly and is assumed to be the same as the length of time shown in relevant figures, or
the length of time in relevant data files. Since the experiments simulated do not quantify vapor
wall losses, these processes are not represented in the model.
For each series of experiments, model runs are then tuned to match measured data by adjusting
free variables that are unmeasured or poorly quantified. Chamber light intensity is adjusted to
match reported jNO2 values28 or to fit reported VOC, NOX, and O3 timeseries.29,30 For the outdoor
experiments of Griffin et al.,29 the default sunlight intensity based on experimental date and
location is halved to best match data, likely a result of overhead aerosol or clouds. For
experiments using HONO as an oxidant precursor, a combination of NOX analyzer
measurements (which measure HONO as “NO2”), and fit to measured timeseries of VOC, NOX,
and O3 are used to constrain HONO concentrations. H2O2 concentrations are unmeasured but
estimated in several publications. While these are generally taken as the mean value of the
estimated range, the concentration is loosely constrained by the NO loss rate (which is sensitive
to H2O2 concentrations) when NO is present in the experiment. For several experiments with no
added NOX, ozone is produced when little is predicted; this is likely due to residual NOX species
off-gassing from the chamber walls.28 In these cases, ozone timeseries are best matched by
adding trace NO or NO2 to the model; in some cases, this is held constant (see Table S.2). Even
when ozone formation does not constrain [NOX], experimental conditions are unlikely to be truly
NOX-free, so a small amount of NO2 (0.1 – 1 ppb, below reported detection limit) is added to the
model. For variables that are not quantitatively constrained (e.g., a reported jNO2 value), final
tuning of these input parameters is carried out by eye to achieve a reasonable fit to reported
VOC, NOX, and O3 timeseries.
Since some experimental parameters are relatively uncertain, the effect of variability in model
inputs is explored through sensitivity testing. Light intensity and all nonzero starting

concentrations are varied individually by ± 30%. These results are first used to assess how
uncertainty in starting conditions impacts the fit between measurement and modeled results. As
described in Results and Discussion, these sensitivities are also used to explore how uncertainty
in starting conditions propagates to measured parameters associated with subsequent chamber
chemistry.
Relative VOC reactive loss pathways and RO2 fates are calculated based on F0AM outputs,
which include time series of all species in the mechanism and rates over time for each reaction.
Reactive loss pathways include reaction with OH, O3, or NO3, as well as direct photolysis for
photolabile product species such as formaldehyde. We extract reaction rates for each “oxidant”
(including hv) over time and separate them into reactions with the precursor and reactions with
other organic products. These time series are interpolated, summed, and normalized to get total
fractional reactive loss pathways for both precursor and total products. Peroxy radical fate is
assessed in a similar way. Peroxy radicals are grouped into initial RO2 and subsequent RO2, and
time-dependent RO2 reaction rates (RO2 + HO2, RO2 + NO, RO2 + NO2, RO2 + RO2, RO2 +
NO3, unimolecular RO2 reaction) are then extracted from the model output. In order to properly
account for the relative importance of reversible RO2 reactions, most notably acyl RO2 + NO2
reactions which generate peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs), rates are calculated by summing any
equilibria such that the reported rate is equal to the net flux (using the F0AM function
ExtractRates with the “sumEq” parameter set to 1). This does not affect calculated rates for other
RO2 reactions, which are not reversible in the MCM. As above, grouped RO2 fate timeseries are
used to obtain total fractional RO2 fate for initial and subsequent RO2. For all model outputs, the
influence of radical promoters, OH scavengers, and additional hydrocarbons is removed using
the output of the tracer mechanism.
Model outputs are further interpreted with respect to the fraction of RO2 reacting with NO vs
HO2, β, and the bimolecular peroxy radical lifetime, τbi. As defined in Pye et al.18, β enables
assessment of the competition between reaction with HO2 and NO (eq. 1), and is used as a
“mixing parameter” in SOA parameterizations to interpolate aerosol yields measured under
“high-NO” and “low-NO” conditions.16–18

The bimolecular peroxy radical lifetime,47–49 τbi, can be used to assess the relative importance of
unimolecular RO2 chemistry. Since unimolecular RO2 reaction rates vary over many orders of
magnitude, τbi can be used as a threshold to indicate whether a given unimolecular reaction
would be competitive, relative to the unimolecular lifetime, τuni (the inverse of the unimolecular
RO2 reaction rate constant). While prior work has often defined τbi only with respect to
bimolecular reaction with NO and HO2,49,21 we define τbi with respect to reaction with NO, HO2,
RO2, NO2, and NO3 (eq. 2), since under some chamber conditions, these additional reactive sinks
are found to contribute to RO2 loss.

Model-measurement agreement and example model output

Figure 1A shows an example model-measurement comparison from a “traditional
photooxidation” experiment in which β-pinene was oxidized in the presence of NOX, propene,
and sunlight.29 The model agrees qualitatively with the measurements, and nearly all values fall
within the envelope of timeseries generated by the sensitivity testing (lightly shaded areas).
While modeled NO2 diverges from the measurements late in the experiment, this might not be a
model error, and instead could be a result of NOy species (e.g., PANs, organonitrates) reported
as NO2 by commercial NOX monitors. For most experiments, measurements similarly
qualitatively agree with model estimates (Figures S.2 and S.3).

However, the tuned model deviates from measurements in several experiments, most notably for

this is unclear, and is not resolved by modulating light intensity or H2O2 concentrations. To
explore the impact of this difference, modeled O3 concentrations are fixed to measured values
and model outputs are recalculated for one experiment for which this occurs. These differ little
from those derived from the original model run (see Figure S.4).

283

Figure 1B-E shows oxidation rates and RO2 fate over time for the example experiment. The
precursor β-pinene reacts mostly with OH, but NO3 becomes an important oxidant as the
experiment proceeds (Figure 1B). Organic products also react mostly with OH, but photolysis
increases in relative importance as formaldehyde and other photolabile aldehydes are formed
(Figure 1C). Similarly, RO2 fate differs for initial vs subsequent RO2. Initial RO2 reacts mainly
with NO, with a small contribution from isomerization (Figure 1D). While NO is still the main
contributor to subsequent RO2 fate, RO2 + HO2 and acyl RO2 + NO2 reactions become
increasingly important later in the experiment (Figure 1E). This demonstrates how oxidant and
RO2 fate can evolve substantially over the course of a given experiment.

Relative VOC reactive losses

Integrated VOC reactive loss pathways for a larger selection of experiments are presented in
Figure 2. This figure shows fractional loss rates to each oxidant for the precursor VOC (first
column) and the organic products (second column) for a selection of experiments. These
experiments are chosen to represent a range of precursors and oxidation categories, illustrating
the variety of oxidant fates seen across the experiments modeled in this study.

In these experiments, researchers generally sought to achieve chemical conditions in which one
oxidant was dominant, for example by using an OH scavenger in ozonolysis experiments to
encourage O3 chemistry to dominate. This is largely achieved for several experiment types—
HONO, H2O2 + NOX, low-NOX H2O2, and low-NOX ozonolysis all feature precursor oxidation
largely driven by a single oxidant (OH or O3). However, this is not the case for traditional
photooxidation experiments, or the “O3, some NOX” experiments. These experiments feature a
mix of oxidants, in which oxidation by NO3 competes with oxidation by OH and O3.
The distribution of reactive pathways for reaction products (second column of Figure 2) is
dramatically different from that for precursors. Ozone reactivity is decreased as double bonds are
consumed, and photolysis becomes an important loss pathway, since many products include
photolabile functional groups. A majority of this photolysis is of small aldehydes (e.g.,
formaldehyde, glyoxal), but larger species can also contribute, depending on the VOC precursor.
While changing reactivity explains many of the differences between fractional loss of the
precursor and the products, these differences are also affected by temporal shifts in oxidant
concentrations across an experiment (e.g., increasing O3 levels).

and product losses are shown in the right column. Experiments are grouped by experimental conditions, and selected
such that each represents a distinct set of starting conditions. Experiment numbers are found in parentheses

Figure 2 also shows error bars representing the range of values observed across sensitivity tests.
Despite varying model inputs by 30%, the ranges observed here are far lower in most cases,
indicating that these results are relatively robust to uncertainties in experimental starting
conditions. The main exception is uncertainties driven by trace NO2 added to low-NOX
ozonolysis experiments (since none of these experiments are carried out under perfectly NOX-

free conditions). Perturbations to trace NO2, e.g., in α-pinene oxidation carried out by Griffin et
al.,29 substantially affect the fraction of oxidation products lost to reaction with NO3, resulting in
larger error bars. This effect is similarly observed for Shilling et al.31 where relatively little total
product oxidation occurs, leaving later oxidation dominated by NO3 reactions (since NO3 is not
consumed by reaction with the OH scavenger n-butanol in the MCM). We note that the
uncertainty ranges shown here do not include possible uncertainties in the chemical mechanism,
which may be substantial but are beyond the scope of this work.

Most OH experiments (with the exception of the traditional photooxidation experiments) feature
conditions designed to favor one RO2 fate. For experiments in which researchers sought to force
all RO2 through reaction with NO (e.g. “HONO” and “H2O2, NOX” experiments), this is often
achieved for initial RO2. Likewise, reactions with high concentrations of H2O2 but no added NOX
typically involve reaction with HO2 as a majority of initial RO2 fate (e.g. Kroll et al. low-NOX
oxidation of isoprene28).
However, numerous experiments feature mixed RO2 fates, particularly with regard to the
influence of RO2 isomerization. RO2 isomerization represents an important initial RO2 reaction
channel, particularly for the “low-NOX ozonolysis” experiments,29,31 but also for the “low-NOx
H2O2” experiments26,28 and even for some experiments in which NOX was added.27,29,30 In many
cases, the isomerization rates are fast enough to dominate the chemistry of a given RO2,
outcompeting bimolecular reaction, but limited by the fact that only some RO2 can undergo
isomerization. In the extreme example of this, ring closure reactions for aromatic species are
considered fast enough (τuni < ~10-4 s)42 to outcompete bimolecular reaction under all conditions
(for this reason, the only bimolecular reactions for initial RO2 from m-xylene (Fig. 3) stem from
the minor OH reaction channel). For RO2 isomerization reactions that involve H-atom
abstraction and hence have slower isomerization rates (e.g., τuni = 0.25 s-1 for one α-pinenederived RO244), reaction conditions can substantially affect the degree of isomerization. For
example, the importance of isomerization in the oxidation of α-pinene by Ng et al.26 shifts
considerably between experiments with and without added NOX (Figure 3). While the
concentrations of HO2 and NO required to largely shut off the isomerization pathway vary with
the isomerization rate, Figure 3 suggests that HO2 concentrations for H2O2 experiments are
typically not high enough to fully suppress unimolecular chemistry. This agrees with previous
work showing that isomerization (assuming a rate constant of ≥ 0.1 s-1) is only partially
suppressed even when [H2O2] is as high as 10 ppm.50 In contrast, reaction with NO can fully
suppress these pathways, but only when large excesses of NO are added (e.g., hundreds of ppb
NO in the oxidation of α-pinene with HONO26).

selected experiments (same as shown in Figure 2). As in Figure 2, error bars reflect the range of values observed in
response to sensitivity tests and represent the range for each type of reaction, not the cumulative range; they do not
reflect any uncertainties propagated from errors in the chemical mechanisms.

360

Subsequent RO2 chemistry can be dramatically different than that of the initial RO2. While this is
impacted by a lack of isomerization reactions in the reaction mechanisms (see Methods),
bimolecular pathways also shift substantially, due to changing reactivity and changing reactant
concentrations. One clear change is the increase in reaction with NO2, driven by increased
NO2/NO ratios (Figure 1) and formation of acyl peroxy radicals, leading to increased RO2 + NO2
reactions forming PAN. RO2 + RO2 reactions notably also increase for “low-NOX ozonolysis

experiments,” where RO2 concentrations are enhanced by the products of OH reaction with
added OH scavengers, and NO and HO2 concentrations remain relatively low. Finally, in the case
of isoprene, for which the MCM includes several unimolecular reactions of subsequent RO2,
isomerization increases in relative importance, in part to due to the gradual increases in τbi that
occur throughout some experiments. While much of this subsequent isomerization is of RO2
species formed directly from the initial RO2 isomerization, it also includes substantial
contributions from the oxidation of first-generation reaction products (e.g., OH + isoprene
epoxydiol and OH + methacrolein).

378

Like in Figure 2, the range of RO2 fates simulated with perturbed starting conditions (error bars
in Figure 3) is smaller than the range of perturbations, suggesting these values are relatively
robust to error in initial conditions. Imperfections in the chemical mechanisms, perhaps most
notably the lack of later-generation RO2 isomerization reactions likely contribute a larger (but
unknown) error to RO2 fate.

379

Comparison with SOA parameterizations

380

Chemical conditions as modeled here can be compared to how these experiments are used in the
GEOS-Chem aerosol parameterization. As mentioned above, the “Complex” aerosol scheme in
GEOS-Chem specifies aerosol yield parameters as a function of β, the fraction of RO2 reacting
with NO instead of HO2. Table 2 presents the classification of experiments used for GEOSChem18 alongside modeled oxidant and RO2 chemistry parameters.

In most cases, RO2 fates calculated here and those assumed in the parameterization generally
agree. This is particularly evident where conditions are pushed to very high levels of NO or HO2
and β falls near 1 or 0.27,28 However, several differences stand out. Sesquiterpene oxidation
experiments from Griffin et al.29 feature a mean β value of 0.93, indicating NO as a dominant
RO2 fate, but are used for parameterizing SOA at low-β (RO2 + HO2) conditions. While β values
from Zhang et al.30 (limonene) and Shilling et al.31 (“monoterpenes”) experiments fall near
expected extremes, β may not appropriately characterize these experiments due to the importance
of other RO2 pathways. A large fraction of the overall bimolecular RO2 fate (Table 2) does not
involve NO or HO2 in these sets of experiments, indicating that these experiments may not serve
as an ideal basis for SOA parameterizations relying on β.

Values correspond to modeled oxidant and RO2 chemistry from experiments used to generate the VBS
parameterization. Note that the total mean bimolecular RO2 fate does not include isomerization reactions. Standard
deviations reflect the variation within the set of experiments.

Similarly, Table 2 illustrates that most experiments feature precursor oxidation by OH or O3,
consistent with assumptions in the aerosol parameterization. The most notable exception to this
however is the oxidation of limonene in high-NOX experiments,30 where ~73% of the precursor
is oxidized by NO3. These experiments may be better suited to a parameterization of SOA
formation following reaction with NO3, since the formation of organonitrate species may impact
aerosol yields52 relative to reaction only with OH and O3.

Perhaps the most important difference between the SOA parameterization18 and the box
modeling results (Figure 3) is that β-based parameterizations do not explicitly capture
isomerization. The potential importance of RO2 isomerization can be described in terms of the
RO2 bimolecular lifetime, τbi.47,49 This metric enables comparison of RO2 conditions in chamber
experiments to atmospheric conditions,21 in addition to facilitating the interpretation of trends in

this study, in comparison with the global distribution of bimolecular lifetimes (weighted by the

τbi over the course of the experiment. The tail transparency is scaled to the percentage of precursor remaining. Point

corresponding to a range of relevant isomerization rates included in the box model are annotated at the bottom of the

Figure 4 demonstrates that experimental τbi varies over many orders of magnitude. Given this
wide range, only a limited number of experiments fall within the global atmospheric lifetime
distribution of RO2 radicals weighted by isoprene oxidation (centered at ~ 60 s and shown in
gray; the distribution is similar when weighted by monoterpene oxidation21), demonstrating that
laboratory conditions usually differ from those found in the atmosphere. However, despite the
large overall spread, experiments can clearly be grouped by their oxidation conditions.
Experiments featuring high levels of added NOX fall around τbi < ~1 s, H2O2 experiments fall
near τbi = 10 s, ozonolysis with some NOX fall around τbi = 10 – 100 s, and low-NOX ozonolysis
falls around τbi > ~ 100 s. While many “traditional photooxidation” experiments feature τbi on the
order of 1 s, some experiments30 feature longer τbi despite high NOX levels, due to suppression of
NO by O3.. The RO2 bimolecular lifetime also varies within experiments (the “tails” in Fig. 4),
often increasing by more than an order of magnitude due to decreasing HOX and NOX levels.

While for very long or very short τbi, this change over time may not substantially affect observed
chemistry, shifts across intermediate τbi may affect the importance of unimolecular reactions as
the experiment proceeds.
Comparing the RO2 bimolecular lifetime to the unimolecular lifetime of a given isomerization
reaction indicates whether that reaction will occur. The unimolecular lifetimes corresponding to
a selection of isomerization rates used in the model are annotated in Figure 4 (slower
isomerization reactions are not shown, as only the relatively fast ones are included in the
mechanisms). While these vary by several orders of magnitude, all are shorter than the mean of
the atmospheric τbi distribution, indicating that these reactions will play an important role under
most atmospheric conditions. This is consistent with an “atmospherically relevant” threshold of
0.1 s-1 (τuni = 10 s), which has been used to represent a lower bound for the rate at which
unimolecular chemistry can proceed as a substantial fraction of RO2 fate.7 The majority of lowNOX experiments involve τbi near or greater than this threshold, indicating that these chamber
experiments included the effects isomerization reactions, even well before the importance of RO2
isomerization reactions was appreciated. In contrast, higher NOX experiments feature a shorter τbi
that prevents all but the fastest reactions from occurring.

471

The wide variability of both experimental τbi and isomerization rates complicate the relationship
between experimental measurements and model SOA parameterizations. Where an isomerization
channel is extremely fast (e.g., ring closure reactions in aromatic species) so as to outcompete
bimolecular reactions under all conditions, the exclusion of isomerization in the parameterization
does not matter, since this reaction will always occur. In contrast, many “atmosphericallyrelevant” isomerization reactions (τuni ≤ 10 s) occur only under low-NOX H2O2 and ozonolysis
conditions, thereby playing a role in the gas-phase chemistry (and ultimately aerosol formation)
in these experiments. While the importance of these reactions in such experiments may not
perfectly match that of atmospheric conditions,50 their occurrence in chamber experiments means
that rapid isomerization processes are to some extent built into the global model aerosol
parameterization for RO2 + HO2 conditions. However, chamber experiments are unlikely to
perfectly capture the importance of isomerization under most atmospheric conditions. Moreover,
under high-NOX conditions, isomerization is largely quenched, such that little to no
isomerization is built into the aerosol parameterization for the high-NOX conditions.

472

Changing chemical conditions across yield curves

473

As mentioned above, aerosol yield curves (aerosol yield vs. mass concentration of organic
aerosol) can be used to derive a volatility distribution that is useful for representing SOA in 3D
models. An underlying assumption for an aerosol yield curve is that the only modified variable is
the mass of organic aerosol into which the gas-phase species partition. However, since the curve
is typically made up of measurements across a series of experiments (which typically involve
different starting precursor concentrations), variability in chemical conditions across these
experiments may affect the resulting aerosol yield curve.

Figure 5 illustrates how chemical conditions can vary across a series of aerosol yield
experiments. In this series of experiments, Zhang et al.30 oxidize limonene under dark ozonolysis
conditions, with low but nonzero NOX. While these experiments were designed to favor the
reaction of limonene with ozone, the NOX present is sufficient to make reaction with NO3 an
important contributor to limonene oxidation. As shown in Figure 5a, this is most pronounced for
experiments with low initial precursor concentrations and hence low organic aerosol
concentrations (cOA); this is due to variation of the NO3/O3 among experiments. Further, at high
precursor concentrations (and high cOA), OH generated by the ozonolysis of limonene starts to
become an important oxidant, exceeding the capacity of the OH scavenger (5 ppm 2-butanol) to
keep [OH] low.

chamber run) for experiments featuring the oxidation of limonene (O3, some NOX) from Zhang et al.30 (expt. 8 – 15).
Each experiment is depicted as a pie chart, plotted across the aerosol mass vs aerosol yield space. Panel B shows
subsequent RO2 fate for the same series of experiments plotted in the same way.

496

Peroxy radical chemistry may also shift as a function of precursor VOC concentration (and
therefore cOA). While initial peroxy radical fate is relatively stable across these experiments (see
Figure S.5), Figure 5B shows that subsequent RO2 fate can also shift across a series of
experiments. At low precursor concentrations (low cOA), reactions with NO3 and NO2 are
relatively important, while RO2 + RO2 reactions become more important at higher precursor
concentrations (and higher cOA). While our modeled subsequent chemistry does not include

503

isomerization reactions that can redistribute RO2 fate, variations in bimolecular chemistry, due
for example to differing total RO2 concentrations, are likely to persist.

510

While Fig 5 (Zhang et al.30) provides an example of how chemical conditions may shift across an
aerosol yield curve, conditions can be more uniform for other experiment types, as shown in
Figures S.7 to S.12. For experiments which clearly favor a single oxidant or RO2 fate (e.g., lowNOX H2O2 experiments), changes in VOC concentration or NOX background have a smaller
impact on modeled chemical conditions. Nonetheless some shifts, such as changes in the
prevalence of RO2 + RO2 reactions, can appear even under these more extreme conditions
(Figure S.8 and S.10).

511

Implications

512

This work demonstrates that chemical conditions in an environmental chamber often represent a
complex mix of VOC reactive loss pathways and RO2 fates, making it challenging to assign a
single pathway to a given experiment. Conditions often vary over the course of an experiment,
and between relatively similar experiments. These changes occur in both the VOC loss pathways
and the peroxy radical fate, and are caused by multiple factors. VOC loss pathways can shift as a
result of changes not only in oxidant concentration, but also in reactivity, as ozone reactivity and
capacity for photolysis changes as the VOC mixture evolves. Peroxy radical fates similarly shift
as an experiment proceeds, with NO2 driving later-generation PAN formation, greater total RO2
concentrations increasing RO2 + RO2 reactions, and decreasing NO and HO2 leading to increases
in the importance of unimolecular reactions (due to increases in τbi).

Patterns in relative VOC loss pathways and RO2 fate arise that are correlated with the varied sets
of starting oxidation conditions. While chamber experiments using HONO, H2O2 (with or
without NOX), and ozone (without NOX) all feature oxidation dominated by a single oxidant,
other types of experiments (traditional photooxidation and “O3, some NOX”) involve a mixture
of oxidants, due to the formation of substantial OH, O3, and NO3 concentrations. RO2 conditions
can similarly be grouped by experiment type, with comparable bimolecular lifetimes and
fractional RO2 fate between like experiments; few experimental conditions (low-NOX H2O2,
HONO) consistently favor a single RO2 fate.
The dynamic chemistry observed here may be relevant for the calculation of aerosol yield
curves, which represent the basis for aerosol parameterizations. As shown in this work, chemical
conditions, including both oxidant and peroxy radical fate, can sometimes vary across a series of
SOA experiments from which an aerosol yield curve is derived. Shifts in chemical conditions
which vary as a function of precursor concentration (and hence cOA) may skew measured yields,
resulting in fitted volatility distributions that do not represent a single chemical condition. The
extent to which these changes may affect measured aerosol formation is unclear, as these
changes are often subtle, and the specific impact of shifting oxidant or RO2 fate on SOA
formation is often not well understood.

When considering the application of SOA chamber studies to 3D modeling, we find that
experimental oxidant and RO2 conditions for a given experiment do not always match how it is
used in a 3D model aerosol parameterization. Most notably, the GEOS-Chem SOA
parameterization bases some low-NOX SOA formation on experiments in which NOX
concentrations are high enough to influence observed chemistry. With more experimental data
now available, reevaluating and constraining aerosol parameterizations may represent a valuable
avenue for future research. Further, since the atmosphere can involve mixed chemical fates,
future work should additionally consider whether the basis for SOA parameterizations should
expand beyond experiments targeting single oxidants or RO2 fates.21
Finally, this work highlights the importance of considering RO2 fates beyond NO and HO2 for
regional and global SOA parameterizations. Despite the limitations of previous SOA
experiments, RO2 isomerization reactions, whose importance for SOA formation was not yet
appreciated when these experiments were carried out, proceed under many of the experimental
conditions used. Ozonolysis or H2O2 experiments with no added NOx feature relatively long
bimolecular lifetimes (τbi > ~10 s), allowing for reasonably rapid isomerization (τuni < ~10 s) to
occur. Because of this, HO2-pathway aerosol yields in 3D models implicitly include the effects
of some RO2 isomerization on aerosol yields. Still, chamber experiments rarely fall into the same
range of bimolecular lifetimes that occur in the atmosphere, indicating that laboratory peroxy
radical conditions generally do not fully match those in the real environment.21 Ultimately, it is
not clear whether this approach to yield parameterizations is sufficient to characterize aerosol
formation in the real atmosphere, which may involve slower isomerization processes that do not
occur in a lab setting, or isomerization processes that may at times compete with reaction with
NO.

572

This study seeks to explore unmeasured chamber conditions used in key historical SOA
experiments, and in doing so, identifies patterns that may be useful both for designing laboratory
experiments and for implementing parameterizations of laboratory chemistry into models. Future
experimental work should consider the role of changing chemical fate with respect to first- and
later-generation compounds, and the influence of changing starting conditions across sets of
aerosol yield experiments (Figure 5). Alternative experimental designs, such as the use of steadystate continuous flow chamber experiments, may help mitigate the challenges associated with
conditions that change over the course of an experiment. Future SOA model schemes must at
least consider the uncertainties in experimental chemical conditions, if not explore the
development of wholly new frameworks to translate experimental yield measurements to the
modeling sphere.
