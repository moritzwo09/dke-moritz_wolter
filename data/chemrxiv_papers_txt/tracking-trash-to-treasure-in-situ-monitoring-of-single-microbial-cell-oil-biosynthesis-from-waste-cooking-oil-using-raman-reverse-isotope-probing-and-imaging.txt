Abstract:
Single microbial cell oil (SMCO) plays a fundamental role in maintaining the structure of cellular
membranes and as energy reservoirs. Oleaginous microbes are known to have a high content of
lipids, which often acts as a microbial factory for the bioremediation of waste cooking oil (WCO)
which is a major pollutant contaminating land and water bodies. The biomass of microbes grown in
WCO can be utilized to develop sustainable value-added products such as biodiesel, organic
chemicals, bio preservatives, biosurfactants biopolymers. Conventional methods excel in SMCO
analysis but lack efficacy for in situ or lysis-free monitoring of nascent SMCO synthesis and its
turnover dynamics. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this study we have employed Raman reverse
stable isotope probing (RrSIP) to investigate the time dependent nascent SMCO synthesis and
assimilation in Yarrowia lipolytica, a well-known oleaginous yeast. Our finding provides a unique
perspective for utilizing optical spectroscopy methods for lysis-free SMCO analysis which holds
potential for utilization as an adjunct tool in bioprocess and biofuels industries.

1. Introduction:
Waste cooking oil (WCO) generated all over the world in domestic kitchens, food processing
industries, restaurants, and others is considered as one of the major environmental
pollutants.1 Unprocessed WCO is a major concern when it is disposed in water bodies and
land which forming oily sludge and contaminating terrestrial and aquatic habitats. In addition,
reusing it for cooking has a hazardous impact on health. 2,3 As per previously reported
studies each year global WCO production is estimated to be around 15 million tons.4,5 WCO
due to its relatively simple chemical composition, primarily consisting of triglyceride esters of
glycerol with long fatty acid chains mainly oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2) makes
it a valuable feedstock from the industrial perspective.6 Multiple studies have reported its
utility to produce value-added products such as biodiesel, bioplastics, biogas, biosurfactants,
biopolymers, lubricants, and others which promotes “circularity and sustainability”.4,6–10 The
bioremediation of WCO has been done via oleaginous microorganisms and the biomass of
oleaginous yeast has become one of the increasingly favoured for sustainable value-added
products in industries as it has a fast growth rate, the inherent ability of lipid storage,
requires less labour and is highly scalable.11 In our study we have used Yarrowia lipolytica
(YL), an oleaginous yeast which can synthesize important metabolites such as microbial oil
containing high levels of unsaturated fatty acid, lipases, proteases and others.12 Bioprocess
based on YL is categorised as GRAS (Generally Recognised As Safe) by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA, USA).13,14 Due to its capability of synthesizing extracellular lipases it
stands out among yeasts to metabolize hydrophobic substrates such as WCO. Few of the
reported YL strains have the potential to accumulate lipids more than 30-45% of their dry
weight.11 The accumulation of the lipids in oleaginous microbes is mostly in the form of triacyl
glycerides (TAGs) with YL strains reported to contain 88-89% of its total lipid content .15,16
TAGs are the neutral lipids which are the most suitable form of lipid for direct conversion to
biodiesel.16 In yeast, neutral lipids are stored in lipid bodies (LBs) also known as lipid
droplets but it also maintains a significant portion of free fatty acids and sterol esters .17,18
In the previously reported studies, SMCO analysis has been performed using highly efficient
methods such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas
Chromatography Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). Determination of fatty acid profile
and quantification with high sensitivity and reproducibility has been achieved.16,19–21 However,
these methods require extraction of the lipids from cells which cannot be applied for in-situ
temporal monitoring of the nascent SMCO turnover dynamics of microbial oil synthesis and
accumulation at single cell level. Fluorescence spectroscopy is another technique for SMCO
analysis using external fluro-probes.22–25 Intracellular SMCO estimation and localization are
done using fluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorimetry.16,26 Lipid bodies of YL have
been analysed in many previous studied using fluorescence imaging. 16,23,25,27 Nile red and
BODIPY are the most used probes for lipids. However, these probes cannot provide
distinctions between specific SMCO saturation and unsaturation components. Another semiquantification method of determining lipids in YL is Flow cytometry using fluorescence
intensity for detecting the amount of intracellular lipid bodies.26. Microbial metabolites can
also be analysed by stable isotope probing using the two known techniques, Secondary Ions
Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and Raman spectroscopy.28 SIMS is a highly sensitive but
destructive method.28,29.

To maximize the utilization of oleaginous microbes for bioremediation of WCO as efficient
biomass in the bioprocess and biofuel industries, understanding the carbon flow, synthesis,
and accumulation of SMCO at the single cell level in lysis-free approach is much needed.
Through this study we propose the prospective utility of Raman spectroscopy methods in
combination with reverse stable isotope probe (RrSIP) for the lysis-free temporal monitoring
of SMCO synthesis and its turnover dynamics at the single-cell level.30–32. In this approach,
the 13C stable isotope-labelled cells are inoculated and grown in presence of 12C unlabelled
source containing culture medium. With the metabolic incorporation of unlabelled carbon in
the newly synthesized metabolites, there is a decrease in reduced mass which leads to an
increase in the wavenumber also known as blue shift of the spectral bands. Monitoring of
this shifted unlabelled band position can serve as the spectral indicator for dynamic
monitoring of nascent metabolites and unlabelled peak positions are well reported in
literature. Further, WCO is inherently a source of unlabelled carbon contributing to the
effectiveness of the RrSIP methodology. As the unlabelled carbon sources have higher
natural abundance this approach becomes cost-effective. 30–33 In previous studies, the
SMCO composition of YL has been reported to be predominated by long-chain unsaturated
fatty acids (UFA) which makes it a potential candidate for industrial use.14,34,35 As UFA is an
integral part of SMCO composition, we have used the unsaturated fatty acid Raman band as
our representative spectral tracer for in situ SMCO analysis. We have monitored de novo
and ex novo synthesis of SMCO using hydrophilic and hydrophobic sources as shown in
Fig. 1. After validating the nascent UFA band as a lysis-free tracer for SMCO analysis, we
have evaluated its applicability for monitoring converting WCO.

2.1.

Yeast Culture

Oleaginous yeast strain Yarrowia lipolytica NCIM 3472 was purchased from the National
Collection of Industrial Microorganisms, Pune, India. YL was pre-cultured in a carbondeficient synthetic broth medium (Sigma Aldrich) and supplied with 10 g/L glucose (Sigma
Aldrich). Incubation parameters for the growth were set with the temperature at 28̇ C
̊ and
the rotational shaker set at 180 RPM. The growth evaluation of YL in a synthetic medium
supplemented with unlabelled and uniformly labelled 13C glucose (99%, Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories) was performed using Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using UV-1900i UV-Vis
Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at multiple incubation time interval (2x). For performing an
inhibition assay, Cerulenin (Sigma Aldrich) a well-known fatty acid synthase inhibitor (50
µg/ml) was used. To reverse the effect of the inhibition assay, exogenous mono and
polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements (oleic and linoleic acid) were provided in 1:1 ratio. All
the standard fatty acids were obtained from Sisco Research Laboratories. Yeast lipid
extraction and protein extraction protocols were adapted from previous reports.36,37 The
Cooking oil namely palmolein and sunflower oil was purchased from a local vendor and
waste cooking oil was provided by a local eatery from IIT Dharwad. Oil samples (100 g/L)
were sterile syringe filtered before supplementing to the synthetic media as the sole carbon
source before inoculation.

Sample preparation, Single-cell Raman spectroscopy and data
analysis:

For the Single-cell RrSIP experiments, the aliquots were washed with 1x-phosphate buffer
saline (PBS, Sisco Research Laboratories). To obtain individual single cells on the ethanol
washed slide appropriate dilutions were performed at different time intervals. WITec confocal
micro-Raman spectrometer, equipped with a 532 nm laser source and 100× objective lens
was used to acquire a single spectrum from each cell. Each spectrum acquired was
averaged over 5 accumulations with a 20-second exposure time. The MATLAB software
version R2021B was used for processing the spectral data. Denoising of the spectral data
was done using the Savitzky Golay filter, baseline corrected with 5th order polynomial and
unit normalized. The mean spectra along with standard deviation and all the other plots were
generated using Origin Pro 2023b Software.

2.3.

Single-cell Raman imaging and analysis:

The single cell was obtained and mounted on a Calcium fluoride substrate as per the
previously mentioned procedure28. For the Raman imaging using WITec confocal microRaman spectrometer, the step size of the scan was kept at around 0.3 microns with a 5
second laser exposure time. The Raman hyperspectral imaging spectral data was preprocessed via routine procedures involving denoising, baseline correction and normalization.
Raman images based on SMCO tracer bands were generated using in-house codes and k
means cluster analysis using MATLAB 2021B software.38 Other plots related to
hyperspectral data were generated using Origin Pro 2023b Software.

3. Results and Discussions:
3.1. In situ Monitoring de novo synthesis of single microbial cell oil and its turnover
using unsaturated fatty acid band as the tracer
Unsaturated fatty acid is an integral part of single microbial cell oil composition. In a
previously reported study, the SMCO content of YL 3472 when compared to other YL strains
was reported to have the highest content of monounsaturated fatty acid grown in glucose

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-dbrr7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9984-5385 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

and the highest polyunsaturated fatty acid content grown in waste cooking oil.16 Band
position at 1655 cm-1 and 1605 cm-1 (cis C=C stretching vibration) in the Raman spectra of
cells have been reported as unlabelled and 13C labelled unsaturated fatty acids. 1445 cm-1
has been used to analyse the total lipid pool which should be the ideal candidate for SMCO
synthesis analysis, but this peak has not been reported to show any isotopic substitution
shift to the best of our knowledge.28,30,39–43
Our first goal was to investigate the feasibility of the RrSIP methodology for SMCO analysis.
We monitored the carbon flow from the carbon source, de novo UFA biosynthesis and
turnover of the nascent UFA in a lysis-free approach at different time intervals. Firstly, we
evaluated the growth pattern of YL grown in carbon source-free synthetic media
supplemented with unlabelled and 13C glucose using optical density measurements at
different time points 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 24, 48 hours as shown in Fig. S1(A). The growth
pattern of the cells was seen to be similar to the cells growing in carbon-source rich media,
confirming unaltered metabolic activity due to 13C substitution. Average Raman spectra of
single yeast cells along with standard deviation at different incubation time intervals (0, 2, 5,
7, 9, 12 and 24 hours) are shown in Fig. 2(A). At 0 hours, the inoculated cells are 13Clabelled, and we observed an intensified 13C-labelled UFA band signal at 1605 cm-1 and a
minor signal at 1655 cm-1 indicating that almost the entire SMCO UFA pool is 13C-labelled. At
2 hours, we observe an increase in band intensity at the 1655 cm-1 region indicating the 13C
carbon flow from culture media to cell cytoplasm and active de novo UFA biosynthesis. At 5
hours we observed an equal intensity of 1605 cm-1 and 1655 cm-1. With further increase in
the incubation time, we observe an increase in the intensity at 1655 cm-1 while that of 1605
cm-1 goes down. At 24 hours, we observe a highly intense signal at 1655 cm-1 whereas at
1605 cm-1 becomes small, but the residual intensity remains as the position is slightly
influenced by ergosterol at 1602 cm-1 and nearby biomolecular signals.44 This shows that
1655 cm-1 band can be a possible tracer of nascent UFA, but further validation is required.
Additionally, the ratiometric integrated intensity at 1655/1605 band position at different
incubation time intervals provides a quantitative insight into metabolic carbon incorporation
and turnover dynamics of nascent UFA. As shown in Fig. 2(B), an increase in 1655/1605 is
seen in earlier time points indicating the newly synthesized unlabelled UFA gradually
replacing the old pool of UFA. The curve reaches a plateau in the late incubation hours
indicating almost the entire old pool of UFA is substituted by the nascent UFA. Fig. 2(C)
shows ratiometric intensity changes in 1655/1445 showing the turnover of nascent UFA in
the total lipid pool of the single YL cells. However, this time-dependent blueshift of the UFA

band may change from strain to strain, in other species and growth parameters which needs
to be optimized accordingly. As UFA are an essential component of SMCO composition and
lipid body (also known as lipid droplet, oil body), therefore time-dependent intensity
dynamics of the nascent UFA band at 1655 cm-1 can be the evident indicative tracer for denovo SMCO synthesis and nascent SMCO turnover similar to the phenylalanine (1003 cm 1 31–33,41,45
)
and Amide I (1667 cm-1) 31–33,41,45 acting as Raman representative protein bands.

3.2.

Validation of the nascent unsaturated fatty acid band from the cells

Further to validate that the detected nascent Raman band signal at 1655 cm-1 position is
coming from unlabelled fatty acid we performed an inhibition assay (loss of function) using
cerulenin, a well-known inhibitor of Fatty acid synthase (FAS), an important enzyme in the
de-novo fatty acid synthesis pathway.46 First we wanted to confirm that the used yeast strain
is not resistant to cerulenin (50 µg/ml) treatment we performed the growth monitoring and
the treatment was done at 7 hours post-inoculation, when cells are in the exponential phase
of division, Fig S1 (B). We observed a clear inhibitory effect of cerulenin on the growth of
yeast. In the next step treatment was done at 0 hour and the average Raman spectra of
cerulenin-treated cells at multiple incubation time points were acquired which shows a
drastic reduction in signal at 1655 cm-1 attributed to nascent unsaturated band position as
shown in Fig. 3(A). The peak intensity at 1655 cm-1 is seen to be negligible from the
cerulenin-treated cell of cerulenin and the intensity at 1605 cm-1 weakens with time. This
supports the possible correlation between the peak at 1655 cm-1 and the nascent
unsaturated fatty acid band in Raman spectra as cerulenin inhibits fatty acid synthesis. The
mechanism of action of cerulenin inhibits the FAS enzyme leading to halted nascent fatty
acid generation in cells which makes the cells to survive by depleting the stored cellular
SMCO and ultimately leading to cell death.
The origin of 1655 cm-1 was also validated through “gain of function” assay. Here, we
reversed the inhibitory effect of cerulenin on the cells by supplementing them with
exogenous UFA.46,47 This rescue of the treated cells by exogenous UFA supplementation
occurs due to its preferential uptake for fulfilling the fatty acid scarcity due to inhibition of

fatty acid sythesis.46 We hypothesized that when treated cells incorporate external UFA for
its rescue, we will observe a sudden spike in peak intensity at 1655 cm-1 from cells at early
time points which is 2 hours in our study. Before supplementing it to cells we wanted to
confirm that 1655 cm-1 is unique to UFA only, to address this concern we took the Raman
spectra of some well-known standard saturated fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acids and
did a ratio metric intensity quantification determining the degree of unsaturation shown in
Fig. S2. The revived growth of cerulenin-treated cells by supplemented exogenous
unsaturated fatty acid can be seen in Fig S1(B) which can be further enhanced when
provided with saturated fatty acids. Raman spectra of rescued cells at 2 hours posttreatment, shows a highly intensified band at 1655 cm-1 which does not originate from de
novo synthesis but from the uptake of exogenous UFA Fig. 3(B). This provides further
evidence in support of the fact that the Raman band position at 1655 cm-1 of cells indeed
arises from unlabelled unsaturated fatty acid. Additionally, quantitative insight into the
ratiometric unsaturated fatty acid band intensity (1655/1605) dynamics between the
untreated cells and cerulenin-treated cells demonstrating the relative difference in nascent
UFA content over time is shown Fig. 3(C). Similarly, a relative quantitative ratio-metric
analysis was performed for cerulenin-treated and rescued cells as shown in Fig. 3(D).
Furthermore, the band at 1655 cm-1 region is broad and this is well known that the spectral
region is associated with adjacent protein band at around 1667 cm-1 (Amide I).32,48 To
address this aspect and validate that the band position 1655 cm-1 is predominately from
UFA, we extracted the proteins and lipids from the reversely unlabelled cells after 24 hours
and recorded Raman spectra. The spectral range cropped to the region of interest covering
UFA and Amide I band is shown in Fig. 3 (E). The highlighted peak position from the
extracted unlabelled lipid is observed at around 1655 cm-1 and extracted unlabelled protein
at around 1667 cm-1. Further, 1003 cm-1 peak of phenylalanine was only observed in Raman
spectra of extracted unlabelled protein which acts as a control.32

After validating that the band at 1655 cm-1 is from nascent UFA and a potential tracer for
SMCO synthesis, we further explored this band to map the distribution and dynamic of
SMCO using RrSIP imaging, Fig. 4 (A). Raman images of YL were generated from SMCO
representative bands normalised intensity using false colour at different time intervals (0, 5,
9, 12 and 24 hours) as Raman intensity is proportional to biomolecular abundances.
Corresponding optical image of the cells is also presented for a better understanding of
cellular morphology. We observed Raman images of the total lipid signal at 1445 cm-1 and
UFA signals (1605 and 1655 cm-1) are giving coinciding signals in co-localized distribution
and have high signal intensity at specific regions of cells are observed which can be
interpreted as lipid body as per previous Raman images lipid body studies. 41,42,49,50 Low
intensity SMCO band signal can be seen all over cellular regions indicating the presence of
free fatty acid as its synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm which is later stored as TAG in lipid
bodies and other forms of lipids as shown in Fig. 4(A). At 0 hour the image shows high
signal intensity distribution at 1605 cm-1. At 5 hours we see equivalent intensity distribution
from both 1605 and 1655 cm-1. However, over time the distribution of 1655 cm-1 in the
Raman image becomes significantly more and 1605 cm-1 reduces. This further demonstrates
that by using the tracer band at 1655 cm-1, the nascent SMCO distribution and turnover
dynamics can be monitored over time. Further Clustered Raman image of the cells was
generated by K-means cluster analysis (k=3). This unsupervised analysis of the
hyperspectral image data set was done at each time interval without specifying any
biomolecular bands. The hyperspectral image data set is decomposed into three different
clusters with each cluster having statistically similar spectral information. Cluster 1 was seen
to be originating from the intracellular region and the corresponding spectral component of
cluster 1 is shown in Fig. 4 (A) & (B). The cluster 1 spectral components of each time point
indicate the dynamic changes in the intensity of UFA at 1655 cm-1 from 0 hour to later
incubation time points. As discussed earlier, at residual intensity remains at 1605 cm-1 as it is
influenced by the presence of ergosterol at 1602 cm-1 and other biomolecular bands. The
spectral component of Cluster 2 also shows biomolecular information and Cluster 3 shows
signals from the background as shown in Fig. S3 (A) & (B).

3.4.

In situ monitoring of ex novo synthesis of single microbial cell oil
synthesis from cooking oil and waste cooking oil source

Ex novo single-cell microbial oil synthesis is the capability of microbial cells to metabolize
and incorporate the hydrophobic carbon sources such as oils, and alkanes and utilize it for
cellular structure, metabolism, and energy storage.51 Firstly, we grew the 13C labelled YL in
the carbon source-free synthetic medium with cooking oil namely palmolein oil and sunflower
oil as the supplemented carbon source and incubated for 48 hours. Cooking oils are majorly
composed of TAGs containing unsaturated fatty acid chains. Raman spectra of palmolein oil
and sunflower oil used in our study as the hydrophobic carbon sources are shown in Fig S4.,
YL can secrete extracellular lipases which break down TAGs into glycerol and fatty acids.
We recorded Raman spectra at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours and monitored the lysis-free carbon
flow from cooking oil to the SMCO pool validating ex novo SMCO synthesis and
accumulation by tracking the dynamics of nascent 1655 cm-1 band. At 0 hours, we noticed
residual band intensity at 1655 cm-1 indicating the cell's SMCO pool is 13C labelled. Post
inoculation at 12 hours we observed intensified band signal at 1655 cm-1 as shown in Fig. 5
(A) and (B). Over time at 24 and 48 hours post inoculation we see the intensified signal at
SMCO bands at 1655 cm-1 and 1445 cm-1 and we see a rise in band intensity at 1740 cm-1
which has been assigned to the ester bond. This indicative increase in band intensity
corroborates with the previous findings which have shown that the ex-novo synthesis
induces higher assimilation of TAGs in YL.51,52 This result aligns with the prior study, which

indicates feeding YL with oil as a carbon source has higher biomass yield when compared to
YL grown in glucose with minimal medium.53 To provide relative quantitative insight into the
accumulation of the unsaturated fatty acid from the ex novo SMCO synthesis in the already
existing UFA pool, the ratiometric integrated intensity at 1655/1605 was plotted with
incubation time showing a linear increment with time with R square value of 0.99 and 0.98
as shown in Fig. 5 (C) and (D).

After monitoring the de novo and ex novo SMCO synthesis in microbial cells targeting the
tracer UFA band, our next goal was to analyse SMCO synthesis grown in synthetic media
with WCO as the only carbon source. It is significant as SMCO produced from WCO helps in
bioremediation as well as serves as sustainable biomass in biofuel and bioprocess
industries. The WCO carbon source notably increases SMCO accumulation by folds when
compared to cells grown in glucose which has been reported in a previous study.11 Free fatty
acids in WCO can be directly used for biodiesel production using conventional well-known
methodologies such as enzymatic catalysis and noncatalytic transesterification routes.
However, it is not a very feasible approach as WCO also contains, water, glycerides,
aldehydes, organic acids and other organic compounds which hinders desirable Fatty acid
methyl esters (FAME) yield and affects the quality of biodiesel. Therefore, microbial-based

bioremediation has been utilized for a cost-effective and improved FAME yield.11 The Raman
spectra of waste cooking oil is shown in Fig. S5. We have already validated the band
intensity dynamics at 1655 cm-1 as a reliable efficient tracer to monitor the SMCO synthesis
and accumulation. We took the Raman spectra from the cells grown in WCO at 0 hour, 12
hours, 24 hours and 48 hours as shown in Fig 5 (E). When compared to 0 hour, we
observed increased peak intensity of 1655 cm-1 band at 12 hours and highly intensified peak
at 24 and 48 hours. At 24 and 48 hours we also observed intensified peaks at 1445 and
1740 cm 1. This shows that the SMCO synthesis and assimilation from waste cooking oil. To
provide relative quantitative validation into the assimilation of UFA and its turnover, the
ratiometric integrated intensity at 1655/1605 was plotted with incubation time showing a
linear increment with time with an R square value of 0.96 as shown in Fig. 5(F). Further
Raman image of the cells from the hyperspectral image data was generated at different time
intervals from 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours as shown in Fig 5 (G). We monitored distribution of the
intensity corresponding to SMCO which is 1605 cm-1, 1655 cm-1 and 1445 cm-1 for
investigating the distribution of UFA and nascent UFA assimilation dynamics. The Raman
image gives us insight into SMCO distribution, localization of lipid bodies. The SMCO tracer
band at 1655 cm-1 shows residual intensity distribution in Raman image at 0 hours which
gets intensified with the incubation time, aids in visualizing the nascent SMCO assimilation
and turnover from WCO. Further hyperspectral image data was subjected to k means (k=3)
unsupervised algorithm forming 3 clusters of different colours. with each cluster having
statistically similar information. The k means cluster image was generated with 3 clusters
and the corresponding spectral components as shown in Fig 5 (G). The spectral pattern of
components of different time intervals of cluster 1 as shown in Fig. 5 (H) which can be seen
to be the group of pixels inside the cells corroborates with dynamics of 1655 cm-1 with time.
The spectral component of Cluster 2 also shows biomolecular information and Cluster 3
shows signals from the background as shown in FIG S5. RrSIP-based in situ monitoring of
SMCO synthesized from waste cooking oil gives qualitative as well as semi-quantitative
insight in a lysis-free and non-destructive manner.
Previously, Raman spectroscopy has been used to study lipids in different microbes. In vivo
lipid profiling of oil-producing microalgae N. oleoabundans, B. braunii, B. sudeticus, C.
reinhardtii, and T. minutus was demonstrated by Seema et al using single-cell laser trapping
Raman spectroscopy and quantitative assessment of the degree of unsaturation was done
using intensity ratio (I1650 /I1440).43 Cheng et al have observed lipid droplets (lipid body) have a
higher contrast at 1654 cm-1 position when compared to cytoplasm because of the lower
contribution from the amide I band .42 Hemanth et al have used Raman stable isotope
probing-based imaging of single yeast cell Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. Pombe) cells
showing protein localization on lipid bodies targeting 13C labelled nascent protein band at
967 cm-1 and lipid droplets at 1602 cm-1 and also reported band at 1654 cm-1 as unlabelled
unsaturated lipid band.41 Using Raman imaging of single cell S. Pombe, Shinshuke et al
have shown the influence of high phospholipid contribution in 1655 cm-1 bands correlating it
with the image from lipid band at 1440 cm-1.40 Yong et al studied the intracellular distribution
and accumulation of lipids in nitrogen deficient condition of freshwater algae Scenedesmus
obliquus using Raman Spectroscopy and imaging targeting band at 1445 cm-1.39 Tsuyoshi et
al have shown the generated Raman images of the Lipid body of oleaginous diatom
Fistularia Solaris Raman band at 1445 cm-1 was observed using Raman imaging and
quantitative analysis of lipid unsaturation was studied using ratiometric intensity I1656 /I1445.
Similarly waste cooking oil has been analysed using Raman spectroscopy without using
microbial mediator studying vibrational mode at 1441, 1657 and 1747 cm-1.54 Even though
the importance of lysis -free in situ monitoring of fatty acid biosynthesis is well known, there
has not been many efforts. The overall study is a unique approach as it demonstrates a

novel application of reverse stable isotope probing combined with Raman spectroscopy and
imaging for in-situ monitoring and visualization of single microbial cell oil synthesis which has
never been done before. Further visualisation of nascent SMCO distribution and turnover
was also analysed using Raman imaging. The RrSIP-based approach can be an intriguing
adjunct for monitoring the waste cooking oil metabolic incorporation and nascent microbial
oil dynamics in an extraction-free approach.

4. Conclusion:
Our findings suggest that the RrSIP coupled with Raman imaging holds immense potential
as an adjunct lysis-free assay to analyse, monitor and visualize lipid dynamics in a
qualitative and relatively quantitative manner. This approach is simple and cost-effective
which can serve as a versatile tool in lipidomics for biofuel and bioprocess industrial
applications.
