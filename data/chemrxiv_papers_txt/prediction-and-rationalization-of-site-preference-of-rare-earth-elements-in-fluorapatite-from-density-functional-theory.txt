ABSTRACT
Fluorapatite (FAp, nominally Ca10(PO4)6F2) has been identified as an important host-material for rare
earth elements and yttrium (REY) in marine sediments. REY can be accommodated in either the larger
6+3 coordinated Ca1 site or the smaller 6+1 coordinated Ca2 site, yet little is known about the site
preference of REY through the lanthanide series despite its importance for understanding REY
enrichment processes in FAp. Theoretical investigations based on density functional theory (DFT)
predict that all REY intrinsically prefer the smaller and more ionic Ca2 site. The Ca2 site preference is
less pronounced when the excess of positive charge resulting from the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution is
compensated by a coupled Na+ for Ca2+ substitution, instead of the energetically more favorable Si4+
for P5+ coupled substitution. The site preference varies quadratically with the ionic radius of REY and
linearly with the sum of their first and second ionization energies. The quadratic shape of the site
preference is similar to the shape of Onuma diagrams, which suggests that the local effective elastic
constant of the site controls the site preference, rather than the nominal size of the site. Despite being
smaller, the Ca2 site has a lower effective elastic constant, and is, therefore, more flexible than the Ca1
site for accommodating larger and smaller trivalent REY cations. Concentration-dependent
computations show that REY clustering is thermodynamically favorable, except for Yb and Lu.

INTRODUCTION
Incorporation of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in apatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH,Cl,F)2) has been
extensively studied in the past decades, when it was recognized that this mineral is the dominant host
for REY in common magmatic/metamorphic rocks.1,2 This topic has attracted renewed attention
recently3‚Äì7 after the discovery in 2011 of deep-sea muds rich in REY in the Pacific Ocean,8 and the
further identification in 2014 of fluorapatite (FAp) as their main host phase.9 REY enrichment can reach
ore-grade in FAp, and therefore marine deposits are considered a potential resource for strategic REY
used in industrial and technological applications, such as permanent magnets, electronic equipment
and catalysis.10 Knowing the crystal chemistry of REY in FAp would help us unravel the geochemical
formation conditions of this georesource and may help develop efficient extraction processes.
The crystal structure of FAp has two non-equivalent calcium sites.11 The Ca1 site is 9-fold
coordinated with oxygen atoms (d(Ca1-O) = 2.554 √Ö), and exhibits C3v symmetry. The smaller Ca2 site
is 7-fold coordinated with six oxygen atoms (d(Ca2-O) = 2.462 √Ö) and one fluorine atom (d(Ca2-F) =
2.311 √Ö, average = 2.440 √Ö), and exhibits Cs symmetry. The Ca1 polyhedra are linked to each other
through faces and to Ca2 polyhedra through corners. In contrast, the Ca2 polyhedra are linked to each
other through corners, not faces. In this way, the Ca1 polyhedra form rigid chains and the Ca2 polyhedra
flexible spirals along the c-axis. The two different Ca chains are interlinked by PO4 tetrahedra (Figure
1).12 Electron and laser probe micro-analysis of magmatic/hydrothermal apatite showed that REY are

incorporated in the crystal structure and substituted for Ca.7 Three questions arise from this result: (1)
in which Ca site are REY preferentially incorporated in the structure, (2) does the partitioning of REY
among the two sites vary through the lanthanide series as a function of the REY concentration, and (3)
how is the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution charge compensated?
The three questions are regularly addressed in the literature, generally indicating that the nature of
the sample (e.g., synthetic vs natural) may cause diverging results, although the Ca2 site is more
commonly reported as the incorporation site of REY. In 1973, Mackie et al.13 synthesized Nd-doped
FAp with a concentration of about 14,000 ppm (mg/kg), which they characterized by single-crystal Xray diffraction. They found that Nd occupies the two Ca sites when Nd is supplied as NdF3 and only the
Ca2 site when it is supplied as Nd2O3. Incorporation of Nd in the Ca2 site with Nd2O3 as dopant source
was confirmed by Fleet et al.14 in 1994 at a Nd concentration of 82,000 ppm. Preference of Nd for the
Ca2 site is also predicted by density functional theory (DFT). Bertolus and Defranceschi15 calculated in
2000 the thermodynamic stability of all possible structural configurations of Ca8NdNa(PO4)6F2 and
Ca9Nd(PO4)5(SiO4)F2. Na+ and Si4+ were incorporated in the models to balance the excess of positive
electric charge resulting from the Nd3+ for Ca2+ substitution. Nd was predicted to occupy the Ca2 site
regardless of the charge compensation mechanism, whereas Na preferred the Ca1 site. X-ray powder
diffraction and infrared spectroscopy were used by Get'man et al.16 in 2010 to study the incorporation
of Sm and Gd in hydroxyapatite (HAp, Ca10‚àíxREYx(PO4)6(OH)2‚àíxOx). Sm and Gd were both found in the
Ca2 site. Luminescence emission of Eu3+ indicates that Er occupies the Ca2 site both in HAp
(Ca10‚àíxEr2x/3‚ñ°x/3(PO4)6(OH)2)17 and in oxyapatite (Ca10‚àíxLax-0.2Eu0.2(SiO4)6Ox/2‚ñ°4‚àíx/2).
The relative preference of REY for the Ca1 and Ca2 sites through the REY series was studied on
both natural and synthetic samples. In 1991, Hughes et al.18 determined the structure of REY-containing
natural apatite using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. They found that the light (i.e., larger) REE (La ‚Üí
Sm) have a marked preference for the smaller Ca2 site. This observation contrasts with bond valence
calculation, which suggested that only La, Ce, and Pr are substituted preferentially at the Ca2 site, while
Pm and Sm should preferentially occupy the Ca1 site. Fleet et al.19 revisited this question in 1995 on
synthetic FAp doped at 79,000 - 110,000 ppm using also single-crystal X-ray diffraction. They found
that the Ca2/Ca1 site occupancy ratio decreases monotonically with the effective ionic radius (IR)20,21
of the REE. For example, the Ca2/Ca1 ratio of La (VIIR = 1.03 √Ö) was 4.04 and that of Dy (VIIR = 0.91
√Ö) was 1.54. This trend is inconsistent with an IR effect only, because the Ca1 site is larger than the
Ca2 site.
In summary, previous studies have shown that REY favor the Ca2 site with, however, some
differences depending on the synthesis method (e.g., NdF3 vs. Nd2O3), and suggested a possible trend
in the relative preference of the lanthanides for the two sites, which remains unexplained.
Regarding the charge balance of the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution, three main possibilities may exist:
Ca vacancies, coupled cation or coupled anion substitution.18,22,23 The two last are most relevant in the
context of marine deposits as sodium ions and silica are present in seawater:

Recently, we have studied the incorporation of Ce3+ in FAp using high energy-resolution fluorescence
detected extended X-ray absorption fine structure (HERFD-EXAFS) spectroscopy and DFT.24 We
showed that Ce occupies the Ca2 site and that Na favors the Ca1 site at a doping concentration of
~15,000 ppm. In absence of meaningful reference energies for ‚Äúfree‚Äù Ca2+, P5+, Si4+ and Na+ cations to
balance chemical equations, the most favorable charge-compensation models were obtained by
comparing their energies relative to those of reference structures in which Ce and the co-dopant are
well-separated and thus minimally interacting. Using this scheme, we found that the charge
compensation with a ùëÜùëñùëÇ!!" for ùëÉùëÇ!#" substitution (eq 2) is energetically more stable than that with a Na
for Ca1 substitution (eq. 1). Furthermore, the coupled Ce3+-Na+ and Ce3+-Si4+ substitutions preferentially
take place at short distance in the FAp structure (e.g., edge-sharing CeO7-SiO4 linkage, Figure 1b). Site
preference and ionization energies were correlated linearly for divalent cations. On the basis of the

atomic charge of divalent substituents, we found that the Ca2 site is more ionic, and therefore is
preferred by dopants with low ionization energies (e.g. Ba) over those with higher ionization energies
(e.g., Mg).
Here, we extend our previous study on Ce to the whole REY series and explore the effect of REY
concentration, focusing on the two main charge-compensation mechanisms, i.e., Na and Si co-doping.
We reveal an intrinsic preference of all REY for the Ca2 site which is enhanced by the Si-based charge
balance. However, at high concentration REY can be stabilized in the Ca1 site if the charge is balanced
by Na.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY
Geometry optimization of the pristine and doped FAp models was carried out using DFT,25 in
combination with Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials26,27 as implemented in the
Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) software,28,29 running on a Linux-based high-performance
computing platform.30 A plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was chosen, along
with the generalized gradient approximation developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)31 to
describe the exchange-correlation potential, coupled with the density-dependent dispersion correction
(dDsC).32,33 The parameter controlling the convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistency cycle
was set to 10-6 eV, and the maximum force convergence threshold was fixed to 0.05 eV/√Ö. An electronic
Fermi-Dirac smearing with a width of 0.026 eV was used, but given the large band-gap of the materials
studied, the smearing had no impact on the converged electronic structure. All relative and reaction
energies discussed in this study refer to electronic energies. Calculation of free energies requires a

phonon computation, which is prohibitively expensive for the largest systems studied herein (1344
atoms), and an estimate of the configurational entropy at different REY concentrations.
FAp crystallizes in the hexagonal system with the P63/m space group,12 and the unit cell has 10
calcium (Ca), 6 phosphorus (P), 24 oxygen (O), and 2 fluorine (F) atoms. The REY concentration was
varied by changing the size of the FAp cell. A single unit cell was used for the high concentration of
about 100,000 ppm (Ca8REY1Na1(PO4)6F2 and Ca9REY1(PO4)5(SiO4)F2) (Figure S1a), a 2 x 2 x 2
supercell for the intermediate concentration of about 12,500 ppm (Ca78REY1Na1(PO4)48F16 and
Ca79REY1(PO4)47(SiO4)F16), as in our previous study24 (Figure S1b), and a 4 x 4 x 2 supercell for a
concentration of about 3,125 ppm (Ca318REY1Na1(PO4)192F64 and Ca319REY1(PO4)191(SiO4)F64) (Figure
S1c). The unit cell is described by 3 x 3 x 3 K-points, and the supercells are probed at the gamma point.
We verified that energies obtained with the unit cell and super-cell models were very similar (Table S1).
The dispersion-corrected PBE-dDsC functional was chosen over the Perdew-Wang34 functional (PW91)
used by Bertolus and Defranceschi15 in their Nd-FAp study based on the comparison of the cell
parameters for FAp obtained experimentally12 and theoretically (Table S2). This is also in agreement
with our previous study on Ce-doped FAp.24 The deviation of the calculated a and c parameters relative
to experiment is 0.5-0.6% with PW91 and <0.1% with PBE-dDsC. The accuracy on geometry is clearly
better with PBE-dDsC. We note that after completion of the computations reported herein, a benchmark
study has been published, recommending the use of dispersion corrections for simulating apatites35
and that dispersion corrections have a long history in being used for apatites.36 Additional spin-polarized
DFT+U computations are included to the Supporting Information (Figures S2) which overall show
similar results to the ones presented herein, but are plagued by difficult-to-converge wave functions
and, thus, numerical noise. The effective Hubbard parameter (U-J) of 4 eV was applied to the REY forbitals as recommended by the open quantum materials database (OQMD).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Charge Compensation. Previous DFT computations on Nd15 and Ce24 showed that the positive
charge resulting from the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution is balanced locally by a coupled Ce3+-Na+ or Ce3+Si4+ substitution. This prior analysis was extended to all REY by calculating the difference in electronic
energy between the ‚Äúclose‚Äù association of the REY and Na/Si dopants (distance <4 √Ö) and the well-

separated arrangement ‚Äúfar‚Äù (distance of ~9 √Ö and ~17 √Ö in the 2x2x2 and 4x4x2 supercells,
respectively). The location of REY and the co-dopant are depicted in Figure 2 for the 2x2x2 cell. Results
are shown in Figure 3 with the two models denoted ‚Äúclose‚Äù and ‚Äúfar‚Äù at a constant concentration of
12,500 ppm. The difference is always negative, meaning that the most stable arrangement is obtained
when the REY and its co-substituent are in close contact, in agreement with the previous theoretical
reports for Nd and Ce.15,24 The gain in energy between the far and the close models is highest when
REY occupy the Ca2 site (denoted REY2) with Si as co-dopant. When Na provides the charge-balance,
it is the REY1 (REY in Ca1 site) substitution that gains the most energy. However, the additional stability
procured for REY1 when Na is displaced from 9 √Ö (far) to the close position is generally not large
enough to counterbalance the intrinsic preference of REY for the Ca2 site (seen in all well-separated
arrangements, Figure S3). In addition, in absolute terms Na provides less stability than Si. This finding
means that charge compensation is more efficient with Si than with Na, regardless of the REY site
occupancy. A main reason for the difference between Si and Na is that the Si tetrahedron allows for
charge compensation at shorter distance to the REY (d(REY1-Si)= 3.08 √Ö for a shared corner), d(REY2Si)= 2.99 √Ö for a shared edge) than does Na (d(REY1-Na)= 3.41 √Ö, d(REY2-Na)= 3.96 √Ö)). Hence, Si
maximizes the Coulombic interactions. The shorter REY1-Na distance compared to REY2-Na distance
is also well in line with Na stabilizing the REY1 site. In summary, local charge compensation by Na
partially counteracts the intrinsic Ca2 preference of REY, whereas Si further enhances it. In the
following, all discussed coupled Na‚ÜîCa and Si‚ÜîP substitutions refer to the ‚Äúclose‚Äù arrangement
(distance < 4 √Ö), unless otherwise stated.

Variation in Bond Distance and Cell Volume. The average REY1-O distances are greater than
the average REY2-O distances, as observed for the Ca-O distances in FAp (d(Ca1-O) = 2.55 √Ö, d(Ca2O) = 2.44 √Ö)12 (Figure 4). In agreement with expectations, d(REY1-O) and d(REY2-O) decrease
approximately linearly with IR along the REY series (R2 = 0.84 and 0.89, respectively). Consistent with
the IR values of the respective cations, substitution of REY for Ca enlarges the polyhedra volume for
La and Ce whereas other REYs contract it. The REY1 and REY2 regression lines have a slope of 0.6
and 1.1, respectively, and 2.53 and 2.45 √Ö intersects. These values are the same for the Na and Si cosubstitutions, within uncertainty of the regression. The two intersects agree well with the expectation
that their values, corresponding to a zero difference in IR, match the size of the Ca sites. In other words,

the +II vs +III oxidation states of Ca and REY marginally influence the size of the site. Another significant
result is that our computations reproduce the relative slopes of approximately 2:1 for the REY1 and
REY2 sites obtained experimentally by Fleet and Pan based for four REY single-crystal X-ray diffraction
measurements.37 Clearly, the Ca1 site is ‚Äústiffer‚Äù than the Ca2 site (smaller slope of the linear
regression), i.e., it does not adjust as easily to a change in the size of the dopant compared to the Ca2
site. This point will be of importance when discussing below the relative site preference and the
connection to Onuma diagrams.
Fleet and Pan (1995)37 observed that the unit-cell volume decreases when the average bond
distance decreases in synthetic (La,Nd,Gd,Dy)-substituted FAp.37 Consistent with this observation, we
found that the difference of volume between the REY substituted and pure Ca FAp is strongly correlated
(R2 = 0.97) with the difference of IR between REY and Ca through the REY series (Figure S4). In
contrast to the bond distance-IR relationship discussed previously, the intersect of the linear regression
deviates significantly from zero (which would indicate identical volumes for REY and Ca FAp), especially
for the Si co-substitution, suggesting non-negligible ‚Äúdilation‚Äù compared to unsubstituted FAp for equal
REY and Ca IR. This is likely related to the longer Si-O (~1.64 √Ö) vs P-O (~1.55 √Ö) bond. These findings
attest to the physical soundness of the DFT analysis.

Figure 4: Variation of the average REY-O distances with the effective ionic radius in FAp for the Na (a) and Si (b)
co-dopants at REY concentration of 12,500 ppm. All IR values are for the six-fold coordination. For reference
purpose, the Ca-O distances are also reported on the graph, but are not included in the linear regressions.

Site Preference and effect of REY concentration. The preferred site occupancy of REY was
assessed from the difference in energy between the Ca2 and Ca1 site occupancies (E(REY2) ‚Äì
E(REY1)). The energy difference, reported in Figure S5 for 12,500 ppm REY, shows that REY are
always preferably incorporated in Ca2 with Si as co-substituent. Charge compensation with Na also
favors REY entering Ca2, except for Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm and Eu, which weakly prefer Ca1. To assess
the influence of REY concentration on the site preference, computations were performed also at
100,000 ppm concentration (one REY atom per unit cell) and at 3,125 ppm concentration (4 x 4 x 2
supercell, Figure 5). As expected, a change from 12,500 ppm to 3,125 ppm marginally modifies the
energetics of the site preference for all investigated compounds (<0.02 eV). REY2 is always the
preferred incorporation mode regardless of the REY concentration in the case of Si charge balance.
The REY2 preference is most pronounced at 100,000 ppm. In contrast to REY-Si co-doping, REY1 is
preferred at 100,000 ppm for REY-Na co-doping, except for Yb and Lu for which the two sites are
isoenergetic. The inversion of site preference for highly REY-Na doped FAp is due to the stabilization
of the REY1 site by Na already seen at lower concentration. Results suggest that the relative site
occupancies depend on the nature of the co-substituent at all concentrations, but that (locally) high REY
concentrations are necessary to favor REY1 over REY2.

Figure 5: Effect of the concentration of REY in FAp on their site preference with Na (a) and Si (b) as cosubstituent. The Ce-Na energy difference is so close to zero at 12,500 ppm, that it is not visible on the graph.

The energetics of REY clustering in FAp was estimated by calculating the reaction energy (‚àÜE) for
moving REY from a diluted to a more concentrated model. For the 12,500 ppm ‚Üí 100,000 ppm reaction,
the energetics is
‚àÜE = E(12,500 ppm) + E(FAp-unit-cell) √† E(100,000 ppm) + E(2x2x2-FAp) (3)
Figure 6 shows that ‚àÜE is negative, which means that phase-separation is thermodynamically preferred
at high REY concentration. The energy difference is about 0.05 eV for REY-Si, while it is about four
times larger for REY-Na. Note that this energetic estimate does not account for configurational entropy,
which would favor homogeneous, well-dispersed solid-solutions instead of phase separation.
Substantial REY mobility in FAp fostered by minimization of entropic configuration requires
temperatures of about 700 ¬∞C. At the temperature prevailing on the earth‚Äôs surface, our computational
results predict that REY tend to be clustered in FAp above ~1% concentration and at thermodynamic
equilibrium.
The energetics for other reactions give a somewhat more nuanced picture. The energy difference
between the 3,125 and 12,500 ppm models is now positive and does not significantly depend on
whether the charge is compensated by Si or Na (Figure S6). This indicates minimal REY-REY
interactions, as expected at relatively low concentrations. Light, and thus large in size, REY have

negligible energy difference, whereas a positive difference close to 0.1 eV is observed for heavy REY.
Two effects are in competition: (i) the ‚Äúsize‚Äù effect, visible at 3,125 ppm, which favors dilution to
accommodate the size-mismatch of the REY in the substituted site, and (ii) dopant clustering, visible at
100,000 ppm, which provides a better screening of charge-defects. The second effect is stronger for
large, Na-compensated REYs (Figure 6). Finally, the enrichment from 3,125 ppm to 100,000 ppm
reflects the competition between the two effects, as the reaction is essentially isoenergetic for small
REY (typically Yb) (Figure S7). In contrast, phase separation into high concentration domains is
preferred for the larger REY such as La and Ce.

Site Occupancy Ratios. The REY site occupancy ratios at equilibrium were calculated from the
Boltzmann distribution function at 700 ¬∞C and compared to the experimental values obtained on REYrich FAp ([REY] = 79,000 - 110,000 ppm) synthesized hydrothermally at 685-700 ¬∞C by Fleet and Pan
(1995).37 Calculations were performed at 12,500 ppm and 100,000 ppm for direct comparison with
experimental values and to evaluate the dependence of the REY2/REY1 ratio on the REY
concentration.
The analysis presented in Table S3 and S4 highlights how our theoretical models compare with
experimental results obtained for the four measured REY (La, Nd, Gd and Dy).37 First of all, the site
occupancy ratios for the Na and Si models at 100,000 ppm are in poor agreement with experiment: The
predicted values for the Na models are below one (except for Yb and Lu), suggesting that Ca1 sites
should be preferentially occupied. In contrast, the four measured REY preferred the Ca2 site. The
reverse affinity is observed for the Si models. They predict Ca2/Ca1 site occupancy ratios of about
eight, compared to ratios between 1-4 observed experimentally. In addition, discrepancy between
observation and prediction is compounded by significant concentration effects, particularly for the Na
models (Figure 5). This disagreement is, however, not entirely surprising given that elemental analysis
of the four measured REY suggests about 40% Si and 60% Na charge compensation and that the
concentration of REY varied between 0.5 (Dy) and 0.8 (Nd) for 9 Ca in the unit cell (our 100,000 ppm
models correspond to 1 REY and 9 Ca). The results for the 12,500 ppm models are in better agreement
with experiment. For La and Nd, the Si models fairly match experimental values. For Gd, a mixed
(Na+Si) model would bring theory and experiment into agreement. Finally, for Dy, the Na models well
match experimental values. This comparison illustrates the challenges: Intermediate concentrations
and mixed Si/Na co-doped models could be necessary to yield good agreement between theory and
experiment. Overall, concentration effects are found to be important, cautioning the use of concentrated
synthetic samples to understand dilute natural samples. This becomes more important in view of the
trends for Na and Si models that diverge at high REY concentration, as discussed previously.

Controls on REY Site Occupancy. The major controls on REY site occupancy have generally been
interpreted in terms of the respective size of the Ca1 and Ca2 sites, although a thorough understanding
is still lacking. Figure 7 shows that the site preference, expressed as the E(REY2)-E(REY1) energy
difference, varies quadratically with IR. The second-degree polynomial coefficient of determination is
>0.9 for both Na and Si. Interestingly, the shape of this curve is reminiscent of the Onuma diagrams,38‚Äì
41 which are used in geochemistry to describe empirically the controlling influence of ionic radii and
valence-state of substitutional doping atoms on partitioning coefficients during crystallization of a
mineral from a melt or fluid. In Onuma diagrams, the parabolic shape indicates that the energetic cost
for doping increases in both directions, i.e., larger and smaller atoms or ions are disfavored compared
to atoms that minimize the size mismatch. Our representation is quite different from the usual Onuma
diagrams, however, because we are not computing partitioning coefficients with respect to the melt, but
relative site preferences for the same material and same dopant in an isovalent series. It is noteworthy
that the maximum of the parabola in Figure 7 is roughly located near to zero on the x-axis, where the
REY and Ca have similar size. Despite a certain degree of uncertainty, a shift of about 0.02 √Ö towards
smaller REY radii is observed. This suggests that the ‚Äúnominal‚Äù size difference between the Ca1 (larger)
and Ca2 (smaller) sites does not lead to a marked site preference for REY: both larger and smaller REY
have a preference for the Ca2 site. Still, the small shift of the maximum to smaller REY radii is in line
with the Ca2 site being smaller.
The physical parameters underlying explanations for Onuma diagrams are considered to be the
excess of elastic strain energy and the dielectric polarization energy. The latter depends only weakly
on the size of the substituent. Hence, it is mostly the elastic strain energy that is responsible for the Ca2
site preference as a function of IR. As described previously, the O-coordination environment of the Ca2
site is about twice as flexible as that of the Ca1 site. Hence, together with the flexible F- coordination,
as attested by the existing solid-solutions and exchanges between fluor- (F), hydroxy- (OH), and chlor(Cl) ligands in apatite, the effective (local) elastic constant of the Ca2 site is likely lower than that of the
Ca1 site. The lower stiffness of the Ca2 site derived from DFT calculation is explained structurally by
the high flexibility of the corner-sharing Ca2-Ca2-Ca2 polyhedral chains (Figure 1). This finding could
well explain the preferred incorporation of REY in the Ca2 site.

explanation. The Ca1 and Ca2 sites differ in their degrees of ionicity (0.429 e and 0.475 e,
respectively).24 Therefore, just like for divalent ions,24 the ionization energies of REY may also influence
the site preference. Figure 8 shows that the site preference is linearly correlated with the sum of the
first and second ionization energies with coefficients of determinations of R2 = 0.77 for the Na models
and R2 = 0.73 for the Si models. The correlation is lower with the second ionization energy alone (R2 =
0.72 for Na and R2 = 0.66 for Si, Figure S8) and weak with the sum of the first, second, and third
ionization energies (R2 = 0.31-0.37, Figure S8). The regression slope is negative, which indicates that
REY which are more difficult to ionize than Ca prefer the more ionic Ca2 site in FAp. In our previous
study,24 we found the reverse relationship for divalent cations: those which are more difficult to ionize
than Ca (e.g., Mg and Cd) prefer the Ca1 site, whereas those which are more easily ionized prefer the
Ca2 site (e.g., Ba and Sr). The opposite trend can be rationalized by recalling that trivalent ions are
naturally more ionic than divalent ions. Therefore, they are generally better stabilized in the most ionic
site (Ca2). On the other hand, divalent ions, which are less prone to lose their electrons, favor the less
ionic Ca1 site.

CONCLUSIONS
This work presents a detailed theoretical study of the incorporation of REY in FAp. REY are intrinsically
better stabilized in the more ionic and smaller Ca2 than in the Ca1 site with a Si co-dopant in close
proximity (< 4 √Ö). Charge compensation with Na in a Ca1 site close to REY stabilizes the light REY in
the Ca1 site at low and medium doping level (3,125-12,500 ppm) and all REY, except Yb and Lu, at
high REY concentration (100,000 ppm). The enrichment reaction is exothermic from 12,500 ppm to
100,000 ppm for all REY, suggesting that there is a thermodynamic driving force for phase-separation
at ambient temperature. Deviation of Yb and Lu from this trend suggests a competition between
favorable interactions among REY atoms leading to clustering, on one hand, and size-mismatch effects
that are easier to accommodate when REY are dispersed in the FAp structure, on the other hand.
A quadratic correlation, reminiscent of Onuma diagrams, was found between the energetics of the
site preference and the ionic radius at 12,500 ppm. The top of the parabola, where stabilization in Ca2
is minimum, peaks where the REY and Ca have similar effective ionic radii. The Onuma-shape of the
ionic radius dependence of the site preference suggests that the Ca2 site is more flexible (i.e., has
lower effective elastic constant) than the Ca1 site, which is also supported by the slope of the REY-O
coordination distance as a function of the ionic radius. Being linked through corners, the Ca2 polyhedra

are more apt to deform than the face-sharing Ca1 polyhedra. Furthermore, the Ca2 site preference was
found to depend linearly on the ionization energy of REY. Noteworthily, the stabilization energy in the
Ca2 site increases with the ionization energy for trivalent REY cations, whereas it decreases with the
ionization energy for divalent cations.24 In summary, ionization energies of REY, together with the lower
effective elastic constant of the Ca2 site compared to the Ca1 site, i.e., Ca2 is intrinsically more apt to
stabilize differently sized ions, appear to be the two main thermodynamic driving forces for their
partitioning between the Ca1 and Ca2 sites.
