Abstract
Germicidal UV (GUV) disinfection is effective against airborne pathogens, but it has been recently
reported to increase indoor air pollution. Conventional GUV at 254 nm is applied in the upper room only
due to skin/eye safety limits, while “Far UVC” (e.g. at 222 nm) is applied across the whole room due to
less restrictive safety limits, enabling simpler installation and disinfection. We investigate GUV between
185 and 310 nm by modeling, in search of an optimal wavelength with both high disinfection and safety.
For a specific fluence rate, GUV-induced air pollution health risks are at least ~20 times larger below 245
nm than above it. This is mainly due to O3 production through O2 photolysis below 245 nm, with a
contribution from particulate matter formation from enhanced volatile organic compound oxidation. When
normalized to a constant CDC-recommended disinfection rate of 5 equivalent air changes per hour
(eACH), pollution risk below 245 nm is also at least ~20 times that above 245 nm. At very high
disinfection rates such as 20 eACH, the difference between the ratios below and above 245 nm is
smaller, but still a factor of ~20. Our results show a clear advantage of upper-room GUV vs. Far UVC for
indoor air quality. These results appear robust despite substantial uncertainties in absolute disinfection
efficiencies, which are a critical limitation for widespread GUV application. Thus, there is no optimal GUV
wavelength across all important criteria (exposure limits, disinfection efficiency, indoor air quality, and
logistic requirements), and these tradeoffs should be considered in different situations to maximize the
overall benefit. Use of Far UVC may require simultaneous deployment of air cleaning for pollution. As
new practical UV light sources at wavelengths other than 222 and 254 nm keep being developed, this
study provides guidance for evaluating and selecting wavelength(s) for GUV air disinfection.

Synopsis
As 200-235 nm germicidal UV (GUV) leads to both more efficient air disinfection and more air pollution
than 245-280 nm GUV does, multiple factors should be considered for maximal benefit of GUV
deployment.

INTRODUCTION
For nearly a century, germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) disinfection has been applied for inactivation of airborne
pathogens, which cause diseases after inhalation of aerosols containing them.1–3 Although there were
early attempts to widely implement GUV,4 it has predominantly remained a specialized technique in
medical contexts, mostly for tuberculosis transmission reduction.3 The COVID-19 pandemic prompted
research confirming the significance of airborne transmission for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory
pathogens.5,6 Consequently, there has been a surge in interest in various methods to remove pathogens
from the air and/or inactivate them, including ventilation, filtration, and air disinfection,6,7 with a particular
focus on GUV.3,8
GUV involves lamps that emit light in the UVC range to irradiate indoor air, inactivating pathogens in
airborne particles.8 Traditionally, filtered mercury lamps have been employed for this purpose, with their
most intense emission at 254 nm ("GUV254").9 As exposure to 254 nm UV is harmful for humans,
GUV254 can only be applied to the upper room or inside ducts.10 Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there
has been growing interest in shorter wavelengths, specifically "Far UVC" in the range of 200-235 nm. Its
most popular implementation is based on KrCl* excimer lamps with a peak emission at 222 nm
("GUV222").8 This interest is due to the fact that direct human exposure to GUV222 is much safer than to
GUV254. The most recent recommendation from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
Hygienists (ACGIH) suggests that GUV222 is 29 times and 51 times safer for human eye and skin
exposures than GUV254.11 This allows irradiation of the occupied whole room and thus a simpler
installation,8 and the measured disinfection efficiency of GUV222 is often higher than that of GUV254 for
airborne pathogens,12,13 despite substantial uncertainties.14–18 UV sources at other wavelengths (e.g., 270
and 282 nm) have also been reported to be used for pathogen inactivation, with disinfection efficiencies
being wavelength-dependent.12,19,20
Recently there have been multiple reports that GUV can produce indoor air pollutants, e.g., O3,21–24
oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA),23–25 sulfate
aerosol,26 and ultrafine particles (UFP).25 These reports cover both GUV222 and GUV254, and include
experiments (in both controlled and real-world settings) and numerical simulations. Nevertheless, there is
a key difference between the indoor air pollution induced by GUV222 vs. GUV254: there is significant
direct O3 production through O2 photolysis at 222 nm, which is not possible for GUV254, since O2 cannot
be photolyzed by UV with wavelengths longer than 245 nm.27 O3 can react with some common indoor
volatile organic compounds (VOC), e.g., limonene, to form OVOC and SOA.24,28 O3 can also be
photolyzed in the whole UVC range, producing OH radicals, the main atmospheric oxidant, which can
oxidize a wide range of species in the air and also form UFP, OVOC, sulfate, and SOA.24,26,29 O3 can also
react with NO2 to form NO3 radicals, another potent oxidant.30 GUV lamps at other wavelengths are
expected to induce similar chemistries, since many of the reactions described above will also be active.
However, the amounts of secondary air pollutants formed from GUV at different wavelengths are
different, since the UV absorption cross sections of the key species are strongly wavelength-dependent
(Fig. 1A), leading to complex wavelength-dependent reaction rates.27
Ozone, particulate matter (PM, of which SOA is an important fraction), UFP, and many OVOC (e.g.,
formaldehyde) are known to have deleterious effects on human health.31–34 There are well established
quantitative relationships between human health risks and exposures to O332 and PM,33 enabling
estimation of net premature mortality associated with exposure to both across a range of GUV
configurations.

In addition to GUV222 and GUV254, devices emitting at other wavelengths for practical germicidal use
have been developed recently. While disinfection efficiency and air pollutant production of all these GUV
devices both depend on the wavelength, these dependencies are complex, and their tradeoff has never
been systematically studied in a wavelength-dependent manner. Here we evaluate the ratio of GUVinduced secondary air pollution to disinfection efficacy over a wide range of wavelengths with high
wavelength resolution, in search of an optimal wavelength(s) that can minimize safety issues (air
pollution, UV exposure risk etc.) while achieving a certain disinfection goal.

elevated (see Panel (A)), and thus only upper-room applications are possible. At the wavelengths in the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Indoor Air Chemical Model
The model used in this study is based on that developed in ref 23 for GUV-induced indoor air chemistry.
The model in ref 23 was adapted from the chemical model of oxidation flow reactor 29 for inorganic radical
chemistry under UVC irradiation. Part of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism36 was added to
describe organic chemistry in a simplified manner. The model has two modes, for upper- and whole-room
applications, respectively. In the upper-room mode, the irradiated volume accounts for 15% of the whole
room and the air exchange between the irradiated and unirradiated spaces is fast (240 and 42.4 ACH for
the upper and lower parts of the room, respectively).23 For our base case the overall room ventilation rate
is kept at 1 ACH. The model runs are conducted in KinSim,37 a chemical-kinetic solver within Igor Pro 9
(Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA).
Several updates to that model have been made. Several key parameters have been refined to better
represent the indoor and outdoor conditions, including outdoor air composition and emission rates of
indoor gases. VOC emission rates are set to values such that their steady-state concentrations in the
model case with a ventilation rate of 0.4 ACH, the other settings described here, and no UV correspond to
the mean values reported by Logue et al.38 0.4 ACH is selected as a typical ventilation rate of US
residences.39 This relatively low ventilation rate results in relatively low VOC emission rates in the base
model case. The secondary pollution corresponding to these emission rates can be considered as a lower
limit. We also apply penetration factors to the outdoor gas- and particle-phase species when they are
transported indoors. The updates to the key parameters are detailed in Table S1.
We also update the aerosol formation and partitioning from simple literature yield-based calculations for
different VOCs in ref 23 to a more detailed dynamic treatment. The framework for the dynamic aerosol
formation and partitioning is based on a two-product volatility basis set (VBS), with the products being
semivolatile and low-volatility species.40 We assume the saturated vapor concentrations of the two
products to be 10 and 0.0001 μg m-3. Their VBS product coefficients of the oxidation of limonene, i.e., the
main indoor SOA precursor, and of the second-generation oxidation of the semivolatile product to the lowvolatility one were fitted to experimental results.28 These coefficients for the other SOA precursors are
estimated based on the literature yields and reported in Table S2. In addition to the partitioning between
gas and particle phases, we also include gas and particle deposition onto the indoor surface, at 7.2 and
0.25 h-1,41 respectively. While gas-particle partitioning is reversible, surface deposition of gas and particle
products is assumed to be irreversible in the model, given the very high equivalent absorptive mass of the
walls.42
Inorganic particle-phase species are also included in this model. Both non-volatile and volatile parts are
considered, with the latter assumed to be NH4NO3. Inorganic aerosol concentration has no impact on the
partitioning of organic species at equilibrium, but inorganic particle-phase species are assumed to form
inorganic cores in aerosols in the model, which can affect the particle size and condensation and
evaporation rates of organics.43

This model also accounts for the influence of human occupants on the indoor air composition. 10
occupants are assumed to be sitting in the room. Exhalation of CO2 and emission of NH3 from occupants
are included, with the emission rate of 0.21 m3 h-1 person-1 and 0.4 mg h-1 person-1, respectively.44,45 For
organics that occupants emit, we consider those contributing most to the total OH reactivity in the room
air, i.e., isoprene and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), whose emission rates are 260 and 19 μg h-1
person-1, respectively.46–48 Release of 6-MHO from human skin to the gas phase due to heterogeneous
reactions of skin lipids and O3 and the gas-phase reactions of 6-MHO with OH and O3 are also taken into
account.49,50 The reactions/processes added into the model for the chemistry of isoprene and 6-MHO are
listed in Table S3.
To investigate the impacts of GUV irradiation at different wavelengths, GUV is assumed to be
monochromatic in individual simulations in this study. A set of 126 model runs (1 nm intervals between
185 and 310 nm) are carried out for each model case. We also assume that the UV field in the room (or
the upper and lower parts of the room in the upper-room mode) is uniform. This is unrealistic for the
wavelengths below 200 nm, where photoabsorption by O2 and water vapor can cause substantial UV
attenuation within a short optical pathlength.27 But this does not affect the discussions and the
conclusions of this study, as the wavelengths below 200 nm are only for illustrative purposes and not
recommended for any practical GUV use.
The model requires absorption cross sections and quantum yields of all photolyzable species in the
model between 185 and 310 nm. Some of those, particularly at shorter wavelengths, are unavailable in
the literature and need to be estimated. We use cross sections and quantum yields from the JPL
Chemical Kinetic Data Evaluation27 and the MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of
Atmospheric Interest35 whenever they are available. This is the case for all photolyzable inorganic species
and some photolyzable organic species. For other organic species, we adopt a strategy similar as in refs
23,51 to estimate their absorption cross sections. Unavailable cross sections at shorter wavelengths are
estimated by extrapolation of data available in the literature for the wavelengths close to the unavailable
ranges. Extrapolation can be done in linear or logarithmic scale, depending on the characteristics of the
available data. Quantum yields are always assumed to be 1 because of the high energy of photons at the
short wavelengths where estimation is required, unless the JPL Chemical Kinetic Data Evaluation27
recommends a non-unity value.
Air Disinfection Efficiency Scenarios
GUV disinfection efficiency data are often highly uncertain and different measurements can span a very
wide range. In this study, we propose two scenarios for wavelength-dependent disinfection rate
coefficients (kd) to account for the large discrepancies present in the literature studies.
The critical data for our study concerns the relative dependence of disinfection efficiency vs. wavelength.
Absolute differences will impact the absolute amount of pollution per unit disinfection, but not the relative
amount which is a focus of our study. To our knowledge, three studies of measurements of efficiencies of
GUV inactivating SARS-CoV-2 at multiple wavelengths (covering 222 nm, 254 nm, and other
wavelengths) are available.12,19,20 Ma et al. measured a kd (e-fold decay) of 3.27 cm2 mJ-1 at 222 nm,
which is in the middle of the measurements available in the literature, ranging from 1.47 to 12.4 cm2 mJ1 14–18
,
while the other two studies both reported 222 nm kd substantially lower than this range. Since ~270
nm is the main RNA/DNA absorption peak wavelength (Fig. 1A), and the absorption and disinfection near
this wavelength have been relatively well studied, we use the 270 nm kd of ref 12 as the reference and
scale the values at all wavelengths reported by Schuit et al. and Fujimoto et al.19,20 by factors of 4.1 and

2.4, respectively, so that all the three kd at 270 nm are identical (Fig. 1D). It can be found that the relative
values (peak shape) above 250 nm from these three studies are in a relatively good agreement with each
other, as well as with the RNA/DNA absorbance trend at these wavelengths. The (after-scaling) kd values
for the whole wavelength range (~195-305 nm) from the fit by Fujimoto et al. are called the Fujimoto
scenario, as compared to other multiwavelength measurements, the Fujimoto dataset can serve as the
lower limit of the possible range of kd after scaling (Fig. 1D). The values for <195 and >305 nm are
estimated with an extrapolation based on the data at the adjacent wavelengths.
After scaling the kd values, some diversity is observed at the lower and higher wavelengths across the
literature studies. kd above ~280 nm from Schuit et al.19 are higher than those from Fujimoto et al.20. kd at
222 nm from Ma et al.12 is substantially higher than those at 222 nm from the other two studies. Thus we
construct the “high-wings” disinfection efficiency scenario by combining the (after-scaling) kd above 275
nm from Schuit et al., those between 235 and 275 nm from Fujimoto et al., and that at 222 nm from Ma et
al. The values between 222 and 235 nm are interpolated and those below 222 nm are estimated with an
extrapolation based on the RNA/DNA and protein absorbance at those wavelengths (Fig. 1A,D). The
relative values between 222 and 298 nm in the “high-wings” scenario also agree well with the recent
measurements of wavelength-dependent disinfection efficiencies for aerosolized viruses MS2 and Phi652
(Fig. 1D).
Total relative risk increase and equivalent “outdoor” concentrations of PM and O3
Increases in either PM or O3 can increase pollution mortality. As their changes are not proportional in
different situations, it is desirable to define a single parameter that captures the overall pollution impact to
simplify the analysis of this complex problem. We define a total relative risk increase (TRRI) as the
combined increase in mortality risk relative to the no-UV case due to increases in various air pollutants for
a given condition, i.e.,
𝑇𝑅𝑅𝐼 = ∑𝑆 ∆𝑅𝑅𝑆

Eq. (1)

where ΔRRS is the increase in all-cause mortality risk ratio (relative risk; RR) due to pollutant S when
GUV is on compared to the no-UV case. As concentration-mortality relationships, which are essential for
quantifying TRRI, have been well established only for PM and O3 to date 32,33, the TRRI in this study only
includes the contributions from PM and O3.
To estimate ΔRRS, both the RR for pollutant S under the conditions with and without GUV need to be
estimated. The latter for a typical indoor space with an outdoor concentration of S (𝑥𝑜𝑆 ), denoted as
𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑜𝑆 ), can be calculated by applying the concentration-response function for pollutant S, i.e.,
Weichenthal et al.33 for PM and Turner et al.32 for O3. Note that the concentration-response functions for
common air pollutants were developed based on their outdoor concentration. RR in this study is
expressed as a function of outdoor air pollutant concentration, although conceptually the health response
should be a consequence of exposure to a pollutant, both outdoors and indoors, not that of outdoor
concentration of that pollutant.
In the presence of GUV, the exposure to air pollutants changes compared to the no-UV case due to
indoor concentration changes. In this case, RR cannot be calculated simply from the actual outdoor air
𝑆
pollutant concentration. Therefore, we define an equivalent “outdoor” concentration of pollutant S (𝑥𝑜,𝑒𝑞
).

To obtain 𝑥𝑜,𝑒𝑞

is equivalent “indoor” concentration of S, which a typical indoor space without GUV would

RESULTS
We simulate the indoor air chemistry induced by monochromatic GUV at different wavelengths between
185 and 310 nm (1 nm interval) for both whole-room and upper-room applications (modes). We simulate
a typical indoor classroom: 300 m3 with 10 occupants, a ventilation rate of 1 air change per hour (ACH) (a
value between typical US residential and commercial building ventilation rates)39,58 with typical US

outdoor air composition, and median emission rates for indoor air pollutants, including limonene38 (see
Materials and Methods for details) as the base case for both the whole- and upper-room applications. In
the upper-room mode, 15% of the room volume is irradiated by GUV. This upper-room space exchanges
air with the lower part at 240 ACH (36 ACH averaged over the whole room). Sensitivity cases under
different conditions are discussed below. Both modes are simulated at all wavelengths so that we can
perform a comprehensive comparison in this study. In practice, use of the whole-room mode should be
limited to GUV below ~235 nm, in order to comply with the eye and skin exposure limits recommended by
the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).8 Whole-room applications
might be allowed between 235-250 nm if the fluence rates or exposure times are lower (Fig. 1B).
Wavelengths between 185 and 200 nm are also included in the simulations to illustrate and compare the
effects of the main chemical and disinfection processes at different wavelengths. Below 200 nm UV can
photolyze water vapor and directly generate OH radicals in large amounts, in addition to increased O3
production. For example, this chemistry is utilized in oxidation flow reactors to accelerate atmospheric
oxidation processes.29 In practice, UV lamps emitting in this range (e.g., unfiltered low-pressure mercury
lamps) should not be used for disinfection because of their strong pollutant formation, the rapid UV decay
within a short distance from the lamp that does not allow whole-room disinfection (due to strong
absorption by O2 and water vapor), and the potential health impacts of direct exposure being unclear.
We calculate ΔPM (PM concentration increase with UV relative to the concentration when there is no-UV)
and ΔO3 (O3 increase relative to the no-UV case) vs. wavelength for both whole-room and upper-room
modes. Since mortality is the largest and most serious health impact of air pollution, to summarize the air
pollution impacts with a single quantity, we define a total relative risk increase (TRRI; see Materials and
Methods for details) for mortality due to long-term exposure to PM and O3 relative to the no-UV case
(TRRI = ΔRRPM + ΔRRO3, where ΔRRPM and ΔRRO3 are the increases in all-cause mortality risk ratios due
to PM and O3, respectively).
In the following, we first present the results for a constant fluence rate (1 μW cm-2) at each wavelength,
which do not involve highly uncertain wavelength-dependent disinfection efficiencies. Then, we show the
results for two specific disinfection rates (5 and 30 equivalent air changes per hour (eACH)) across
different wavelengths, which do involve uncertain and wavelength- and pathogen-dependent disinfection
efficiencies.

Constant Fluence Rate at each Wavelength
Fig. 2A shows TRRI vs. wavelength at an average fluence rate of 1 μW cm-2 (effective fluence rate
averaged over the whole room for either mode). Mortality risk generally increases as the GUV wavelength
decreases towards 185 nm. Two large jumps in TRRI occur at ~244 and ~199 nm. These correspond to
large increases in ΔO3 and in ΔPM, respectively.
Above 245 nm, O3 cannot be directly produced through O2 photolysis by GUV. GUV photolyzes O3 and
produces OH in a similar way as in the troposphere, i.e., via production of O(1D), which then reacts with
water vapor to form OH.27,29 As a result, ΔO3 is negative at most wavelengths >245 nm. It becomes
slightly positive only above ~290 nm, where i) O3 photolysis is much weaker due to O3 absorption cross
section being >1 order of magnitude lower than its peak value at 254 nm, and ii) O3 production in the
same way as in the troposphere (i.e., via NO2 photolysis, which produces O(3P) that recombines with O2
and forms O3) is much stronger due to the NO2 absorption cross section being ~1 order of magnitude
higher than at ~250 nm. At >245 nm, TRRI is dominated by ΔPM, almost all of which results from VOC
oxidation by OH (Fig. 2A).
Below 242 nm TRRI (>~0.0013) is at least 20 times larger than at >245 nm (<~6x10-5), mostly due to ΔO3
resulting from O2 photolysis (Fig. 2A). Although the contribution of ΔPM to TRRI is smaller compared to
ΔO3 for our base case, ΔPM in this wavelength range is substantially larger than above 245 nm. A much
higher O3 concentration at 200-242 nm promotes terpene ozonolysis and leads to most of the increase in
ΔPM, consistent with Jenks et al.28 The OH increase relative to the no-UV case in this wavelength range
is of the order of 103 molecules cm-3, and thus cannot lead to a substantially higher ΔPM than above 245
nm. TRRI monotonically increases with decreasing wavelength, because of the same trend on the (1 nmaveraged) cross section of O2 absorption (Fig. 1A), which leads to direct O3 production.

Below 198 nm, water vapor can be photolyzed, leading to a strong direct production of OH.
Consequently, compared to 200-242 nm, OH concentration increases at least by a factor of 15. This high
OH rapidly oxidizes VOCs and causes a large increase in ΔPM (and hence TRRI) by about an order of
magnitude (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, O2 absorption and ΔO3 do not have a large increase around 199
nm, and thus do not contribute to this drastic increase in TRRI.
Note that the results of both whole- and upper-room simulations at 1 μW cm-2 are reported in Fig. 2A, and
they are almost identical. This is due to the air exchange between the irradiated and unirradiated spaces
in the upper-room mode being faster than the other production and loss processes of O3 and PM at this
fluence rate. This indicates that at 1 μW cm-2, if both whole- and upper-room modes use UV light at the
same wavelength (e.g., both at 222 nm), they lead to almost the same disinfection and air pollution.
Constant Disinfection Rate
We also examine mortality risk at specific disinfection rates. Two effective disinfection rates for the whole
room (not only for the irradiated space, in the upper room case), i.e., 5 and 20 eACH, are investigated.
The former is the value recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
close to that from the World Health Organization recommendation (6 eACH) for COVID-19.59,61 The value
of 20 eACH is chosen because the mid-value of the upper-room GUV254 fluence rate range (30-50 μW
cm-2) recommended by the CDC for tuberculosis60 leads to a disinfection rate close to 20 eACH in our
model. The fluence rates needed to achieve these disinfection rates are different at each wavelength (Fig.
S1), as they are inversely proportional to the (pathogen-specific) disinfection rate coefficients (kd) at each
wavelength. Measurements of kd have large absolute uncertainties (1-2 orders of magnitude, Fig. 1C), but
mostly consistent trends vs. wavelength (within factors of 2-3; Fig. 1D). To investigate the disinfection vs.
pollution tradeoff vs. wavelength, while accounting for the differences in relative wavelength trends in the
literature, we investigate two disinfection efficiency vs. wavelength scenarios (Fujimoto and “high-wings”;
Fig. 1D; see Materials and Methods for details). The Fujimoto scenario is based on Fujimoto et al.;20 the
“high-wings” scenario has higher disinfection efficiencies at <235 nm and >270 nm (higher “wings” in the
disinfection efficiency curve).
At 5 eACH of disinfection, the TRRI of the upper- and whole-room modes are still very close (Fig. 2B). For
the Fujimoto disinfection efficiency scenario, TRRI at 5 eACH is not substantially different from that at 1
μW cm-2 in the wavelength range of interest of this study, except for those >290 nm. This similarity is
because i) the relative variation in the disinfection efficiency coefficient (kd; in base e, same hereafter) of
this scenario with wavelength is relatively small (within a factor of 2 between 185 and 290 nm; Fig. 1D),
and ii) a fluence rate of 1 μW cm-2 and a kd around 1.5 cm2 mJ-1 (a ballpark value for this estimate) at a
ventilation rate of 1 ACH result in a disinfection rate of 5.4 eACH. The drastic increase of TRRI at 5 eACH
above 290 nm corresponds to the fast decrease of the disinfection efficiency as the wavelength increases
from 290 to 310 nm. When kd is low at these wavelengths, the fluence rate needed for 5 eACH is high,
which causes more secondary air pollution. Large differences between the two kd scenarios results in
high uncertainty in TRRI in this region.
For the “high-wings” disinfection efficiency scenario, TRRI at 5 eACH below 235 nm or above 275 nm is
lower than that for the Fujimoto scenario (Fig. 2B). This difference is due to the higher kd for the “highwings” scenario at these wavelengths. TRRI at 5 eACH does not monotonically increase with decreasing
wavelength between 200 and 235 nm, unlike the Fujimoto scenario (Fig. 2B), but rather stays about
constant. This is due to the stronger increase of kd in the “high-wings” scenario in this wavelength range,
which allows reduced fluence rate that offsets the increased air pollution (if fluence rate is constant)

shown in Fig. 2A. TRRI at 5 eACH in the “high-wings” scenario below 235 nm is still >20 times larger than
that above 250 nm, mainly due to the strong direct O3 production by O2 photolysis at shorter wavelengths
as discussed above.
The results for 20 eACH show a significant (about 50%, Fig. 2C) difference between the upper-room and
whole-room setups. When the disinfection rate is higher, the fluence rate in the irradiated space for the
upper-room mode is also higher. As a result, the viable airborne pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) gradient
between the unirradiated and irradiated spaces becomes more pronounced, and the disinfection rate for
the whole room is limited by the transport of viable SARS-CoV-2 from the unirradiated space to the
irradiated space through air exchange between these two zones. A disinfection rate of 20 eACH averaged
over the whole room in the upper-room mode requires a high fluence rate that may result in the SARSCoV-2 concentration in the upper room significantly lower than that in the lower room, depending on the
airflow patterns in the room, assuming the lamps are installed in the ceiling.23 This reduces the efficacy of
the upper-room GUV and in turn requires a higher effective fluence rate (averaged over the whole room)
than in a whole-room setup. According to our additional simulations at different disinfection rates (1-30
eACH; Fig. S2), this discrepancy between the two modes for a specific disinfection rate starts becoming
significant at a disinfection rate ~10 eACH and increases drastically as the disinfection rate approaches
the limit due to in-room air exchange, i.e., 36 eACH (for the volume of the whole room) in our simulations.
Impact of Variations in Indoor Conditions
We also investigate how the results change over large ranges of ventilation rates of 0.1-30 ACH, and of
indoor VOC emission rates (relative to the base case) of 0.1-10. This sensitivity study is performed only
for the “high-wings” disinfection efficiency scenario, where the TRRI at “wings” wavelengths (i.e., <235 nm
and > 275 nm) is lower than in the Fujimoto scenario. Since the results above indicate that there are
mainly two distinct wavelength regions (for whole- and upper-room GUV, respectively), we explore the
ratio of TRRI between 222 (in the whole-room mode) and 254 nm (in the upper-room mode), the most
representative wavelengths of each region, at disinfection rates of 5 and 20 eACH (Fig. 3). Even so,
except for the strongest (weakest) ventilation and the weakest (strongest) indoor emissions explored, the
222 nm-to-254 nm TRRI ratio is >1 and, under most conditions, >10 (Fig. 3A,B). Moreover, the conditions
with TRRI ratio <1 correspond to TRRI ratio <0, due to negative TRRI (less air pollution compared to the
no-UV case) for GUV254 under these conditions. Note that the higher TRRI ratios at low ventilation rates
and/or high indoor VOC emissions are no longer directly due to O3 formed through O2 photolysis, but
mainly due to PM formed through VOC ozonolysis, as the high TRRI at 222 nm under these conditions
are mostly contributed by PM (Fig. 3C). The drastic decrease of the contribution of O3 to TRRI with
decreasing ventilation rate below 0.9 ACH is associated with the equivalent “outdoor” O3 (in terms of
exposure mortality; as calculated in the way described in Materials and Methods) decreasing below the
threshold in Turner et al.32 (Fig. S3), below which no mortality risk increase due to O3 was reported by
Turner et al. Note that this lack of reported mortality risk increase in their O3 concentration-mortality
relationship resulted from scarcity of low ambient O3 concentrations. Even at low equivalent “outdoor” O3
concentrations, low levels of one of the two main contributors, indoor O3, may be related to strong O3
loss62 and high levels of O3 reaction products. The latter is associated with negative health effects,63
although, to our knowledge, a quantitative concentration-mortality relationship that can be used in this
study has not been developed.

DISCUSSION
In practice, GUV at 200-235 nm and that at >245 nm are almost only used for the whole-room and upperroom applications, respectively. As discussed above, wavelengths below 200 nm are of little practical
interest. Because of low disinfection efficiency and high cancer risk (Fig. 1A), wavelengths above 280 nm
are also not practically useful. In the following, we thus only compare 200-235 nm (shorter) and 245-280
nm (longer).
It can be concluded with high confidence that longer-wavelength (245-280 nm) upper-room GUV
produces substantially less secondary indoor air pollution per unit disinfection than shorter-wavelength
(200-235 nm) in whole-room applications (Fig. 2). We first discuss the uncertainties in the results, and
then their implications.
Uncertainties in Disinfection Rates
The absolute values of kd are a major source of uncertainty of the absolute pollution mortality-todisinfection ratio, but much less so for the relative trend of that ratio with wavelength. For instance, the
absolute values of kd for SARS-CoV-2 at 222 nm reported in different studies range about two orders-ofmagnitude.14–18 If the real kd at 222 nm is close to the high end of the range of the literature
measurements (~12 cm-2 mJ),16 the fluence rate needed to achieve a specific disinfection rate is about ¼

of that for the “high-wings” scenario, and the corresponding TRRI is also about ¼ of that scenario.
Conversely, if the real kd at 222 nm is close to the lower values reported in the literature, the
corresponding TRRI would be an order-of-magnitude larger.
Literature kd values for the same pathogen are generally higher in aerosols than in aqueous solutions.64,65
The relative trend of kd across wavelengths reported in Ma et al.12 is consistent with RNA/DNA absorption
for >245 nm and with the measurements and the explanation (higher contribution from protein and lipid
damage) by Lu et al. (Fig. 1A,D).64,66 These authors recently reported aerosol-based multiwavelength kd
measurements for other viruses than SARS-CoV-2 (MS2 and Phi6; Fig. 1C,D),52 whose relative
wavelength trend agrees well with Ma et al.,12 but is different from other literature results.19,20 These
comparisons across wavelengths show that the relative dependence of kd on wavelength (see Materials
and Methods for detail) is within a factor of ~3 for wavelengths near 222 nm and within a factor of 2
for >245 nm for all the studies that have reported multiwavelength measurements for SARS-CoV-2 in
solution and other viruses in aerosols (Fig. 1D).12,19,20,52 This results in limited uncertainty on our
conclusions about the relative trend. As the range that (after-scaling) kd reported in the literature span is
largely captured by the Fujimoto and “high-wings” scenarios, the uncertainty about the relative trend is
unlikely to be substantially larger than the difference between the results of these two scenarios.
The extrapolation of kd below 222 nm in the “high-wings” scenario could be too optimistic, as kd is
estimated to increase as fast as the protein or RNA/DNA absorption efficiencies, without accounting for
aerosol shielding effects.67 Thus the pollution per unit disinfection below 222 nm for this scenario could be
a lower limit. Nevertheless, the possible underestimation of the pollution per unit disinfection below 222
nm only reinforces our conclusion that this pollution at shorter wavelengths is higher than at longer
wavelengths.
Uncertainties in Pollutant Formation
There are also uncertainties associated with the chemistry model. The root cause of higher TRRI below
235 nm is O3 produced from O2 photolysis. This is a simple photochemical process whose kinetic
parameters were well quantified decades ago.68,69 The O3 production rate through this pathway is
governed by the O2 absorption cross section, whose relative uncertainty is ~20%.35 The estimation of the
cross sections and quantum yields of organic species whose measurements are unavailable in the
literature (see Materials and Methods for detail) may also introduce uncertainty into the model. We
quantify the potential impact of this treatment for organic photolysis in the UVC range with a sensitivity
case where all organic photolysis processes are removed. The relative change in ΔPM of the sensitivity
case is up to ~15% below 290 nm, and within a factor of 2 between 290 and 310 nm (Fig. S4). The
relative change in ΔO3 is negligible below 245 nm but larger above this wavelength. Nevertheless, the
contribution of ΔPM to TRRI between 200 and 245 nm is minor. And ΔO3 between 245 and 290 nm is
negative, of which the amplification cancels the contribution of ΔPM to TRRI in this wavelength range
(Fig. 2). These lead to the very small relative change in TRRI between 200 and 290 nm. At longer
wavelengths, as discussed above, practical interest of GUV is low, and the relative change in TRRI is still
within a factor of ~2.
Despite the uncertainties in the kd and the chemistry model, the difference in TRRI is so large (>1 order of
magnitude) that the conclusion that longer-wavelength (245-280 nm) GUV produces much less air
pollution than shorter-wavelength (<235 nm) GUV for a specific disinfection rate is robust.
Implications for the net health benefit of GUV device deployment

As ~85% of the air that people inhale is indoors54 and typical indoor-to-outdoor O3 ratios are ~25% in the
US,57 indoor O3 accounts for about half of O3 exposure of the US population. As discussed by Xiang et
al.,53 indoor O3 exposure is a main contributor to the observed correlation between outdoor O3
concentration and mortality. Here, based on key results of this study and some simple estimations, we
consider if the mortality due to GUV-induced indoor air pollution can be significant compared to the
number of lives that GUV air disinfection can save from airborne diseases.
At a fluence rate of 1 μW cm-2 (corresponding to a disinfection rate of several eACH for SARS-CoV-2,
depending on kd), ΔO3 between 200 and 235 nm ranges from ~4.9 to ~1.2 μg m-3 (~2.5-0.6 ppb), with that
at 222 nm being 2.7 μg m-3 (1.4 ppb). Considering the about-half contribution of indoor O3 to O3 exposure,
we estimate such an indoor ΔO3 of 2.7 μg m-3 to be equivalent to an outdoor O3 increase of 4-5 ppb, to be
used in the concentration-response relationships that have been developed only with outdoor data. This
may lead to a ~0.9% increase in all-cause mortality (if O3 increases PM as discussed above, the mortality
increase could be even higher), while ~2.4% of the deaths in the US in 2023 were related to COVID19.70,71 For simplicity, mortalities due to both other airborne diseases (e.g., influenza and tuberculosis)
and exposure to other secondary indoor air pollutants (e.g., OVOCs) are ignored here as they are
expected to be smaller.32,72 As GUV usually reduces airborne disease transmission and increases air
pollution exposure of indoor space occupants at the same time, a long-term use of short-wavelength
(200-235 nm) GUV devices without air pollution mitigation measures would be likely to both save lives
from COVID-19 and other airborne diseases and increase mortality due to GUV-induced O3 pollution. If
GUV device installations are still too low to significantly change the dynamics of an airborne epidemic, the
numbers of lives it saves and the deaths caused by its air pollution could be of the same order of
magnitude. When the highest values of kd at 222 nm reported in the literature are considered (~x4 higher
than the “high-wings” value),16 mortality due to air pollution would be an order-of-magnitude lower than
lives saved from airborne diseases by GUV disinfection. GUV-induced air pollution would be a smaller but
still significant concern. On the other hand, if the real kd at 222 nm is close to the lower end of the range
of the literature measurements, 222 nm GUV application might bring little net health benefit due to air
pollution.
As a consequence, the traditional upper-room longer-wavelength (245-280 nm) GUV application is still of
high interest, particularly for long-term use (when community transmission of airborne disease(s) of
interest is sustained) at moderate fluence rates (e.g. 5 eACH), as it results in much lower GUV-induced
secondary indoor air pollution and thus the related mortality by about an order of magnitude or more.
Is there an optimal GUV wavelength?
In summary, across the wavelengths explored in this study (185-310 nm), there is not an optimal
wavelength that is the best in terms of disinfection efficiency, ease of practical use, secondary air
pollution, and exposure safety. There are wavelength ranges obviously worse than others, i.e., 185-200
nm (due to very high secondary air pollution and nearly impossible practical functioning in real indoor
settings) and 280-310 nm (due to high cancer risk and low kd). Whole room 200-235 nm and upper-room
245-280 nm represent two regimes of operation with clear tradeoffs. In terms of air pollution per unit
disinfection, longer-wavelength GUV has a clear advantage over its shorter-wavelength counterpart.
Nevertheless, this advantage does not negate the less logistic requirement, ability to reduce close-range
transmission, and the potentially higher kd of shorter-wavelength GUV, and hence the highest possible
disinfection rate in its whole-room application, all of which can be critically helpful for a fast response to
an emerging airborne disease and suppression of an airborne epidemic. Shorter wavelength long-term
applications may necessitate the integrated use of pollution scrubbers (e.g. O3 removal catalysts and PM
filters).

Current upper-room installations use mostly 254 nm, partially due to low cost of the lamps.8 There are
longer wavelengths with slightly better ratios of GUV-induced indoor air pollution per disinfection (Fig. 2).
At a specific disinfection rate, GUV near 280 nm, where GUV exposure cancer risk is still relatively low
(Fig. 1A), can reduce TRRI to about half compared to that at 254 nm. However, the uncertainties in
disinfection rates and higher cost of operating at other wavelengths result in limited incentives to operate
upper-room systems away from 254 nm. Increasing the upper room air exchange rate (e.g., with a fan)
can be a way to improve the performance of upper-room GUV (in terms of air pollution per unit
disinfection) when the disinfection rate needed is high.23,60 A strong air exchange (achieved through
mixing as recommended by CDC tuberculosis guidelines)60 between the lower and upper room can limit
the penalty of airborne pathogen depletion in the upper room at a high GUV fluence rate, thus lowering
the fluence rate needed and reducing associated air pollution. Air pollution mitigation, such as ozone
destruction and PM filtering, can be performed for both whole- and upper-room GUV, albeit at additional
cost, to maximize the overall health benefit of GUV applications.
The future of whole-room shorter-wavelength GUV depends partially on more accurate determinations of
kd in the real world. If real kd are at the lower end of the literature, its use may be limited to periods or
locations with high mortality risk from airborne diseases, such as health care settings where infectious
disease and/or immunocompromised patients are present, or high occupancy settings with unsuspected
infectious individuals like jails and prisons. If real kd are at the higher end of literature, wide-scale
deployment with small pollution scrubbers may be attractive.
