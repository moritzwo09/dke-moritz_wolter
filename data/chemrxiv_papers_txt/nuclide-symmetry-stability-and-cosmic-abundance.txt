99.5% of ordinary polynucleonic matter. These are the most kinetically resilient (stable) nuclides
within the highly exothermic reaction conditions of cosmic nucleosynthesis. This paper analyzes
the relationship between a nuclide’s equinucleonic (Z=N) composition and its relative cosmic
abundance. Structural symmetry emerges as a sensitive and specific predictor of superabundance
within a proposed alternating nucleon model. The model derives from the proton’s radius (r
=0.8414 fm), the hadron’s prolate shape (from the transition to the proton’s first excited state,
the ∆+(1232) resonance), and the separation distance between a pair of bound nucleons (≈ 0.8
fm, from the nucleon-nucleon potential). Various nucleon geometries were considered for each
nuclide, with preference given to structures having optimal numbers of stable proton-neutron
short-range interactions and whose model radii (derived from the regular polygon radius
formula) best correlate with experimental charge radii (r(31)=.98, p<.001). Remarkably, the bestfit solutions for the eight superabundant Z=N nuclides categorically demonstrate bilateral
structural symmetry, in which neutrons reflect protons on opposite sides of a bisecting chiral
plane. Conversely, when an element’s stable isotopes are compared, the best-fit structures in
which nucleon symmetry is not possible (generally because proton and neutron numbers are
unequal) are less abundant by ≈ 2 orders of magnitude. Symmetry is ubiquitous in nature, and
the proposed alternating nucleon model is consistent with the axiom that structural symmetry
confers structural stability.

1. Introduction
Protons and neutrons are the smallest units of ordinary matter to have measurable size. The nucleon
structure of matter begins with the empirical knowledge of structural and compositional factors leading
to the superabundance of light nuclides. These include nuclear shape, sequence and occupancy of
nucleons, kinetic stability, and density, addressed here within the framework of a proposed nucleonic
cylindrical lattice model. The model’s representational coordinate-space geometry is surprisingly
straightforward and comprehensible on its own terms.
Introductory textbooks commonly depict protons and neutrons as hard spheres, closely packed
within a roughly spherical nucleus. While useful stoichiometrically, empirical evidence suggests that
neither nucleons nor nuclei are generally spherical. The charge radii of the larger nuclides may roughly
scale with the cube root of the mass number, consistent (in many cases) with a spherical nucleus. [1]
However, below 7Li, the erratic sawtooth radius-to-mass of the lightest nuclides is not compatible with
sphericity (figure 1). Neither are individual nucleons spherical. The electromagnetic excitation of the
nucleon to its first excited state, the ∆ resonance, has provided clear evidence of a prolate spheroid

Figure 1. A nuclide’s charge radius-to-mass number plot is initially

of sphericity scales poorly with the lightest nuclide radii. (The formula’s
proportionality constant typically ranges from 1.2 to 1.3.)
(football shape) deformation of the ground state charge distribution. [2] Atomic spectroscopy of the
deuteron (2H) also indicates a prolate shape. [3] Curiously, the radial charge and point-proton densities
of the stable helium isotopes 3He and 4He suggest a hole or central depression in the nuclide structure.
[4] (12C and 16O demonstrate a similar central dip in their radial charge densities. [5] [6]) And no closepacked nucleon model accounts for the deuteron radius of 2.12 fm, which is oddly larger than the 4He
nucleus of 1.68 fm, even though the latter has twice as many nucleons. [7] This is not consistent with a
crystalline lattice of closely packed nucleons, in contrast to the generally constant or flat central charge
densities of the medium to heavy nuclides. Given that 99.9% of the ordinary (baryonic) mass of the
universe is contained within the lightest nuclides through 36Ar, these curiosities and inconsistencies are
no trivial matter.
In addition to nuclide structural factors, nucleon knock-out experiments (in which a projectile
impacts a target and the momenta of the fragments are compared) have demonstrated an important
compositional factor. Nucleons pair up within nuclei to form short-range correlated pairs (SRCs). [8]
(These are predominantly proton-neutron pairs due to the action of the spin-dependent tensor part of the
strong nuclear interaction. [9]) More recent knock-out experiments using high-energy electron beams
directed towards nuclei from carbon to lead demonstrate that pn SRC pairs are a universal phenomenon
and similar in all nuclei. [10] The pn SRC pair represents a prototypic stable proton-neutron NN
interaction, in contrast to the unstable proton-proton or neutron-neutron interactions. Clearly, the pn
SRC pair is important and must be accommodated within a comprehensive treatment of the atomic
nucleus.
The proton/neutron ratio of the most abundant stable nuclides also bears mentioning. Though
hydrogen (the proton) comprises most of the ordinary matter of the universe (74%), when nucleons
combine to form the most durable polynucleonic matter, they do so in a one-to-one ratio of protons to
neutrons. [11] 99.5% of ordinary baryonic matter by mass (aside from hydrogen) contains equal numbers
of protons and neutrons (figure 2). The equality of nucleons is an essential attribute of the kinetically
stable forms of matter.
The relationship between nuclide composition and cosmic abundance was a focal point of Maria
Goeppert-Myers’ 1963 Nobel lecture: "That nuclei of this type are unusually abundant indicates that the
excess stability must have played a part in the process of the creation of elements." [12] She was
referring to the kinetic stability or durability of nuclides containing "magic numbers" of protons and
neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, etc [13]) created in the highly energetic processes of stellar nucleosynthesis.
However, a survey of cosmic abundance indicates that of the top 10 most abundant nuclides [11], only

He and 16O contain magic nucleon numbers. Goeppert-Myers’ statement nonetheless speaks to the
implicit relationship between a nuclide’s kinetic stability and its cosmic abundance. Inasmuch as cosmic
abundance implies kinetic stability, the compositional factor that most closely correlates with abundance
is the equality of protons and neutrons.
While only two of the ten most abundant light nuclides have magic numbers of protons or
neutrons, alpha cluster models demonstrate a higher success rate at anticipating relative cosmic
abundance. Seven of the ten most abundant nuclides are alpha nuclides. Exceptions include 1H, 14N, and
56
Fe, whose abundances are predicted by neither the shell model nor alpha cluster models. While the
unusually abundant alpha nuclides contain a whole number of multiples of helium nuclei (by definition),
the best-fit geometric molecular arrangements of clusters of alpha particles are challenging to reconcile
with experimental charge radii. Royer and Eudes report various geometric arrangements of helium

nuclei within the nuclides "#!C, "!$O, #%
"%Ne, "#Mg, and "!S, yielding respective best-fit radius predictions
of 2.43 fm (versus experimental of 2.47 fm), 2.83 fm (vs 2.70 fm), 2.79 fm (vs 3.01 fm), 2.85 fm (vs
3.06 fm), and 3.37 fm (vs 3.26 fm). [14] Although the data set is small, the correlation between predicted
and experimental is r(3)=.87, p=.056, which is not statistically significant at p-value < .05. The charge
radius predictions of clusters of 4He nuclei correlate only loosely with experimental charge radii. This
may suggest a rearrangement of nuclear material into nuclide geometries consistent with experimental,
perhaps as a final step in the alpha process.
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods provide the most accurate picture of interactions at the
nucleonic level. The approach is not intended for the introductory-level science student, but the generally
spectacular results offset the complexity. Many of the basic properties of nuclei can be obtained from
mean-field approximations (as opposed to 3D coordinate-space geometric systems), which replace
interactions between individual particles with an average effective interaction or “molecular field.” [15]
Carlson et al. present an overview of nuclear physical properties (including point-proton radii) for A ≤
12 nuclear ground states using Green's function Monte Carlo methods (GFMC) in TABLE I of a review
article. [16] Computational difficulties limit current GFMC simulations to few-nucleon systems, so the
data set is limited, but the point-proton radii rp of included stable nuclide data through 12C demonstrate
a strong positive correlation with experimental (r(6)=.99, p<.00001). All values are in fm, and
experimental results follow each GFMC rp prediction in parenthesis: 2H 1.98(1.96), 3He 1.76(1.76), 4He
1.43(1.46),6Li 2.39(2.45), 7Li 2.25(2.31), 9Be 2.31(2.38), 10B 2.28(3.31), 12C 2.32 (2.33).
In addition to structural and compositional factors, a more subtle but equally perplexing challenge
relates to the sequence and occupancy of nucleons within nuclides through 36Ar. The list of stable

nuclides progresses stepwise, one nucleon at a time, except for the unstable 5 and 8 amu nuclides. Why
isobars of these two nuclides are unstable and why the sequence of stable nuclides progresses one
nucleon at a time is unclear. Further confounding the matter, the selection of either a proton or a neutron
during each successive step of the sequence appears random. A complete structural model of the atomic
nucleus ought to predict why the addition of one type of nucleon (and not the other) would result in the
next stable nuclide while somehow accommodating the disruption in the stepwise sequence at the 5 and
8 amu nuclides.
Again, the compositional factor that most closely correlates with nuclide abundance is an equality
of protons and neutrons. This factor is clearly necessary, but apparently not sufficient, for nuclide
durability. Both 6Li, 8Be, 10B, and 36Ar have equal numbers of protons and neutrons but are among the
rarest of naturally occurring nuclides. [11] Conversely, 56Fe is one of the top 10 most abundant nuclides,
having an unequal number of nucleons (26 protons versus 30 neutrons). Its unusual abundance may
arise out of the formation of 56Fe as one of the last exothermic (thermodynamically favored) fusion
reactions in the nucleosynthetic chain, resulting in the accumulation of 56Fe as an end product of
supernovae nucleosynthesis. [17]
While the lighter nuclides are generally more abundant than heavier nuclides (see figure 2), the
elements lithium, beryllium, and boron are ≈ five orders of magnitude less abundant than the next three
heavier elements, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (from which they derive). [11] All six are initially
produced by stellar nucleosynthesis, a highly kinetic environment that subjects nuclei to what structural
engineers might term a “dynamic impact load.” [18] However, the fragile isotopes of lithium, beryllium,
and boron (along with 3He) are thought to be destroyed shortly after formation. [19] Instead, their natural
occurrence is a result of spallation, a process involving the fission by a cosmic rays of carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen, respectively. [20]
A clue to the implied structural fragility of the spallation nuclides may arise from the difference
in the charge radius determinations obtained from electron scattering versus muon scattering
experiments. [21] In Angeli’s 1999 table of nuclear radii, the seven e-scattering radius measurements
for 6Li range from 2.38 to 2.76 fm, ≈25% smaller than those produced by the three µ-scattering
determinations ranging from 3.1 to 4.2 fm. From the same table, the 25 e-scattering measurements for
12
C range from 2.35 to 2.53 fm, largely overlapping the ten µ-scattering determinations ranging from
2.40 to 2.60 fm. Additionally, the 12C determinations are significantly more precise, regardless of
method. Since the muon is ≈ 200 times as massive as the electron, the impact of heavier muons may
deform and distort the fragile 6Li nucleus while having minimal effect on the durable 12C nucleus.
Angeli’s updated 2013 table of nuclear radii conveys similar information relating to the errors and
uncertainties of radius determination within the term ∆tot R (fm). The scarcity of the spallation nuclides
coincides with the magnitude of their ∆tot R. [7] For relatively fragile (and scarce) 6Li, the ∆tot R =
0.0390 fm is more than an order of magnitude larger than the relatively durable (and abundant) 12C ∆tot
R = 0.0022 fm. This pattern extends generally to all spallation nuclides versus the significantly more
abundant equinucleonic nuclides. Presently, no structural model of the atomic nucleus easily accounts
for the structural fragility that leads to the scarcity of lithium, beryllium, and boron.
Here, we present a 3D coordinate-space model that is rigorously consistent with the accepted
empirical knowledge of the atomic nucleus and yet remains accessible across all disciplines of science.
Best-fit structures correlate near-perfectly with IAEA-accepted charge radii for all stable nuclides
between 1H and 36Ar. Structures below 7Li assume various geometries, while above 7Li nuclide
structures build upon progressively larger anisotropic cylindrical lattices of alternating protons and
neutrons. Remarkably, one end of the anisotropic nuclear cylinder exhibits steric features that determine
the sequence and occupancy of successive nucleons, which generally favor the formation of stable
proton-neutron NN interactions and pn SRC pairs. Within the parameters of the model, nuclides
exhibiting bilateral symmetry predict cosmic abundance, while those isotopes in which symmetry is not
possible (generally because proton and neutron numbers are unequal) correlate with scarcity.
2. The Model
If atomic nuclei are bound systems of discreet protons and neutrons, a geometric representation of the
nucleus must include both the size and shape of the nucleon in addition to the separation between them.

The NN interaction determines this separation. It is derived phenomenologically and depends on factors
such as spin, alignment, orbital motion, and local nuclear environment. Commonly used NN potentials
include the Argonne AV18 potential, as well as the Paris, CD-Bonn, and Nijmegen potentials. [22] The
minus derivative of the potential yields the force between a pair of bound nucleons, which is short-range
and dependent on the distance between them (figure 3(b)). The interaction is repulsive below r = 0.7 fm,
but above this threshold, the interaction is attractive, reaching maximal attraction at ≈ 0.8 fm. [23] The
result is a potential well that maintains the distance between bound nucleons around a nadir wherein
attractive and repulsive forces balance.
The shape of the hadron is also relevant to the coordinate space packing of nucleons. Multiple
studies of the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the proton have led to the expectation of a non-spherical
nucleon shape. These studies analyze the transition to the first excited state of the nucleon, the ∆(1232)
resonance. [24] [25] [26] [2] figure 3(a) illustrates one perspective on the ground and excited states of
the neutron. [27] The proton and neutron have nearly the same mass (938 MeV) and are otherwise
identical in every respect except charge. Buchman (2005) suggests that the repulsive spin-spin state
between like-flavored quarks and the attractive spin-spin state between unlike-flavored quarks positions
the pair of like quarks at opposite ends of the prolate nucleon, leaving the unlike quark in the center.
[27]
The spatial extent of the qualitative linear representation of quark triplets produces the elongated
or prolate ground state nucleon shape shown in figure 3(a). This depiction is purely representational as
individual quarks have never been isolated, and the uncertainty principle precludes knowing their exact
locations and momenta. Additionally, the ground and excited state deformations shown in figure 3(a)
appear to result from their respective quark distributions; in reality, each quark is surrounded by a
deformed cloud of quarks and antiquarks. [28]
The qualitative quark triplet depiction proves useful in the geometric modeling of nuclide radii
regardless of its relationship to reality in a manner perhaps analogous to the depiction of electron pairs
in Lewis’s dot structures. In the context of the model, qualitative quark depictions imply average quark
positions that define the spatial extent of the nucleon. In concert with the separation between nucleons
derived from the NN potential (figure 3(b)), the model predicts the deuteron's IAEA-accepted charge

short-range correlated pair (deuteron). Per the model, the nucleon radius is determined by the spatial
extent of its qualitative quark positions. Thus, the proton radius rp=0.84 fm is the distance from the
proton’s central down quark to an adjacent up quark, equivalent to the nucleon separation set by the
NN potential. The deuteron’s predicted radius of 2.10 fm (half the rotational diameter of 4.20 fm)
correlates with the experimental deuteron charge radius rd = 2.13 fm. [53]

radius remarkably well. The deuteron in figure 3(c) is the prototypic representation of the ubiquitous
short-ranged correlated pn pair, or pn SRC [10] , a pair of strongly interacting nucleons whose distance
of separation is comparable to their radii. The force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, so
attractive and repulsive forces balance (i.e., the force between nucleons equals zero) at the graph’s nadir
where the slope of the NN potential is zero, defined by Ishkhanova at ≈ 0.8 fm. [23] For the purposes of
predicting light nuclide radii, the best fit to experimental occurs when the approximation ≈ 0.8 fm is set
specifically equal to the proton’s charge radius 0.84 fm. [29] A geometric ball-and-stick representation
of the deuteron’s quark positions then emerges in which the rotational diameter (4.20 fm) equals the
sum of the proton and neutron lengths (1.68 fm each, twice the proton’s radius) plus the separation
distance between them derived from the NN potential (0.84 fm), as shown in figures 3(c) and 4. This
yields a rotational radius of 2.10 fm (half of 4.20 fm), a ≈99% fit to the experimental deuteron charge
radius of 2.13 fm. [29]
This representational quark geometry exemplified by the deuteron applies to the remaining
nuclide structures. As shown in figure 3(c), the quark-to-quark spacing between nucleons is equivalent
to the quark-to-quark spacing within nucleons, both equal to 0.84 fm. This leads to a generalizable
regular 0.84 fm spacing between sequential average quark positions without regard to nucleon positions.
This regular spacing becomes an essential constant when incorporated within the radius formula of a
regular polygon (formula 1) to predict the charge radius of 4He and larger nuclides, as shown below.
The list of stable nuclides through 36Ar progresses stepwise, one nucleon at a time, and proposed
structures will (generally) be addressed in a similar stepwise fashion. The next stable nuclide after the
deuteron is 3He, but the structure of 4He will be addressed first for the sake of expediency. One candidate
structure for 4He is a qualitatively linear arrangement of its 12 quarks. The regular spacing of 0.8414 fm
between sequential quarks yields a total length of 9.255 fm and a rotational radius half this at 4.628 fm.
This is far greater than the experimental charge radius of 4He 1.6755(28) fm [7] , and it becomes
necessary to consider a denser arrangement of nucleons. A circular arrangement provides the desired
symmetry and density. A better correlation with the experimental charge radius of 4He arises from the
qualitative positioning of its 12 quarks on the 12 vertices of a dodecagon (12-gon), shown in figure 4.
The predicted radius 𝒓 derives from the general radius formula of a regular polygon as shown in Formula
(1), where a is the distance between two neighboring quarks (0.8414 fm), and the number of sides (or
vertices) n equals 12, the number of quarks:

proton’s radius. Rotation may distort 6Li’s

nuclides are drawn to scale relative to the

The regular polygon formula predicts a 4He radius of 1.625 fm, which falls within the range values
included in Angeli(1999) (1.61-1.70, n=11(e-scattering)) [21], and is a close approximation to the
IAEA-accepted charge radius of 1.6755(28) fm. [7] Importantly, this point-symmetrical circular isomer
is consistent with the empirical knowledge of helium structure, which indicates a hole or central
depression in the electron scattering radial charge densities of 3He and 4He, as reported by McCarthy et
al. [4]
The best-fit structure of 3He derives from the same regular dodecagon structure. 3He has only nine
quarks, however, so three of the 12 dodecagon vertices are unfilled. The resulting irregular horseshoe
shape (figure 4) shifts the center of mass away from the dodecagon center, precluding the use of the
regular polygon formula. The new center of mass must be calculated by weighted average. The predicted
radius of rotation is 1.92 fm (versus the accepted charge radius of 1.9661(30) fm [7]), as determined by
the distance from the calculated center of mass to the farthest quark (figure 4). The predicted radius of
1.92 fm is well within the range of the 3He charge radius values included in Angeli (1999) (1.84-1.97
fm, n=9 (e-scattering)). [21] The shift away from the dodecagon center consequently imparts to 3He a
predicted radius larger than 4He (≈1.68 fm). Like the circular structure of 4He, the resulting horseshoe
shape of 3He also has a central depression or a hole in the charge radius, as reported by McCarthy et al.
[4] (Many of the remaining light nuclides though 36Ar demonstrate a similar central depression in the
charge densities. [6])
There is a precipitous drop in abundance after the helium isotopes in the plot of cosmic abundance
as there is no stable five amu nuclide. The half-lives of the isobars 5He and 5Li are measured in
yoctoseconds (one preceded by a decimal point and 22 zeros), and this mass gap effectively halts the
proton-proton nucleosynthetic chain from continuing beyond 4He. [30] The alternating nucleon model
predicts this mass gap as no five amu nuclide can form an uninterrupted ring of alternating nucleons
analogous to the ringed arrangement of nucleons in 4He. The proton/neutron bound state is the only
stable NN bound state, and at some point, in a closed circular arrangement of five nucleons, there would
be an unstable proton-proton or neutron-neutron interaction precluding ring closure.
The radius prediction of 6Li derives from Formula 1 and a qualitative distribution of its 18 quarks
into a regular octadecagon (18-gon). The predicted radius of 2.432 fm is within the range of reported
charge radius values included in Angeli(1999) (2.38-2.76 fm, n=7 (e-scattering)). [21] If the ring
arrangement of four nucleons in 4He produces a kinetically stable structure (as indicated by its
abundance and low ∆totR =0.0028 fm [7]), then a ring arrangement of six nucleons may result in a more
lax structure for 6Li. Ring laxity and nuclear rotation may then distort the octadecagon into an oval
(figure 4) with a long-axis radius of rotation closer to the IAEA accepted charge radius of 2.5890(390)
fm. [7] Alternatively, as with any lax ring, the structure may demonstrate stable node/anti-node
oscillation states [31], in which the long axis of the oval oscillates between 0° and ≈ 90°. Furthermore,
the proposed non-rigid structure of 6Li may account for its unusually large uncertainty of charge radius
measurement (∆totR =0.0390 fm [7]) across an unusually wide range of reported experimental radius
values (2.38-2.76 fm) by electron (e)-scattering. [21] The significantly larger charge radius values
obtained by muon (µ)-scattering (3.1-4.2 fm [21]) may relate to the greater mass of the muon (200x
greater than the electron), which may mechanically perturb or distort the 6Li structure during µscattering experiments, resulting in a larger muon charge radius.
Subsequent best-fit alternating nucleon structures build upon the 6Li ring by the incremental
addition of nucleons, resulting in the more linear radius-to-mass above 6Li shown in figure 1. 7Li is a
6
Li ring with a neutron inclusion in the ring’s center (figure 4). The neutron inclusion is similar in
principle to the orbiting nucleons of a halo nucleus, which mechanically enlarge the experimental charge
radius. [32] However, rather than orbiting around the nucleus in a halo, the 7Li neutron inclusion
occupies the interior of the nucleus. The included neutron effectively inflates the loose oval of 6Li (with
its large long axis radius) into a more rigid ring having an effectively smaller rotational radius. The
radius prediction of 7Li is thus the radius of the surrounding six nucleon ring. As with 6Li above, the
radius of 2.432 fm is predicted by formula 1 and a regular octadecagonal arrangement of 18 quarks,
resulting in a close match to the value accepted by the IAEA 2.4440(0.0420) fm [7], and well within the
range of the 7Li charge radius values included in Angeli (1999) (2.38-2.44 fm, n=4 (e-scattering)). [21]

Li is an order of magnitude more abundant than 6Li, which is atypical. Isotopes having an odd mass

number are generally at least an order of magnitude less abundant than the even mass number isotopes
to either side. The greater abundance of 7Li may imply greater kinetic stability. Perhaps the 7Li neutron
inclusion serves as an architectural cross-member that stabilizes the lax 6Li ring by distributing dynamic
impact loads, similar in principle to the function of a cross-member within a bridge truss. [33]
8
Be is an alpha nuclide with a half-life ≈ 10-16 seconds. The 8Be mass and instability suggest a
transient bound state of two helium nuclei. The present representational model predicts a nucleon
sequence in which a proton added to the 7Li neutron inclusion would create a stable pn SRC pair, and
that the SRC would then associate with the 6Li ring within a 6Li + 2H bound state. The proposed structure
is shown in Table 1 below. However, given that there is no stable 8 amu isobar, it may be that the
proposed node/anti-node vibrational instability of the lax 6Li ring structure (as discussed above) might
be sufficiently destabilizing to preclude binding to 2H.
The best-fit alternating nucleon structure of 9Be combines a 6Li base ring bound to a 3 nucleon
npn sequence on a second incomplete ring, as shown in Table. Using the ring separation value rs =
0.9616 fm determined from the structure of 12C (discussed below), the predicted radius of 2.47 fm is
well within the range of the 9Be charge radius values included in Angeli (1999) (2.20-2.53 fm, n=9 (escattering)) [21] , and a close match to the value accepted by the IAEA 2.5190(0.0120) fm. [7]
Importantly, each of the three nucleons on the second ring is associated with its opposite isospin nucleon
on the 6Li base ring to form proton-neutron pairing of another type.
The next two stable nuclides, 10B and 11B, have roughly the same experimental charge radius as
7
Li. All three radii ≈ 2.42 fm, essentially the same radius (2.43 fm) predicted for a regular octadecagon
by formula (1) where n =18 quarks (6Li) and a is the proton’s radius (0.8414 fm). Within the model, 7Li,
10
B, and 11B all have a base 6Li ring structure with the mass of their additional nucleons contained within
the interior of the 6Li ring. Thus, the predicted radii of all three nuclides equate to the radius of the
exterior base 6Li ring. 7Li has a neutron inclusion, as discussed above, but within the proposed 10B
structure, the exterior 6Li ring loosely includes a ringed four-nucleon 4He nucleus instead of a neutron.
The extremely low cosmic abundance of 10B (see figure 2) is consistent with a loose association between
the rings. The proposed structure of 11B is the same as 10B but with an additional neutron tethering the
base 6Li ring to the included 4He ring. 11B is four times more abundant than 10B, indicating that the added
neutron has a stabilizing effect similar to the example of 7Li. Here we suggest that the added neutron
may tether the two rings together, as shown in Table 1. These two nuclides 7Li and 11B, along with 19F
and 31P below, are examples where an additional neutron may structurally reinforce and thus bestow
greater durability and abundance. Regardless, the somewhat precarious nature of the proposed spallation
nuclide structures is intentional and designed to reflect a measure of expected fragility commensurate
with their low relative cosmic abundances.
In mechanical systems, the lamination of flexible materials confers both stiffness and strength.
[34] The proposed structure of 12C comprises two stacked 6Li rings (figure 5) sharing a common
geometric axis. The open ring structure is consistent with the central dip in the point-proton density of
12
C, as illustrated by Carlson (2015). [16] Although the individual 6Li rings are lax and fragile within
the model, the “lamination” of two 6Li rings predicts a more rigid and durable structure for 12C, as
suggested by its unusually high cosmic abundance and low uncertainty in measurement ∆tot R = 0.0022
fm. [35] Each 6Li ring qualitatively distributes 18 quarks on the vertices of a regular octadecagon having
sides a = 0.8414 fm and r = 2.432 fm per Formula 1. The proposed structure of 12C exhibits perfect point
symmetry. This implies that the distance from the 12C center of mass to any of its 36 qualitative quark
positions is the same and equal to the IAEA-accepted charge radius of 2.4702 fm. The 12C abundance,
symmetry, and small uncertainty in measurement (∆tot R = 0.0022 fm [35]) are consistent with stability
and rigidity, making 12C ideal for setting the standard distance between adjacent parallel rings necessary
for predicting the radii of multi-ring structures. The charge radius and perfect point symmetry
geometrically fix the ring separation rs at 0.9616 fm. Additionally, the prolate nucleon has a long-axis
radius equivalent to the proton’s radius of 0.8414 fm. The 0.9616 fm distance between rings limits the
short-axis radius of the prolate spheroid nucleon to half this, or 0.4808 fm, when the nucleon is
associated in parallel with an opposite isospin nucleon on an adjacent ring.
12
C and 13C have nearly identical radii (2.47 fm and 2.46 fm, respectively), even though 13C has
an additional neutron (figure 5). This is similar to the cases of 7Li, 10B, and 11B discussed above, all three

Figure 5. The nucleon structure of a light nuclide sterically determines whether an additional proton
or neutron will be incorporated within the next stable nuclide. The sequence generally favors the
formation of one or more stable NN interactions (i.e., pn PRC pairs). Where the addition of either
nucleon (as in the case of 14N) or neither nucleon (as in the case of 12C) results in a stable sequential
NN interaction, the progression defaults to adding a neutron in order to maintain a stable ratio of
neutrons ≥ protons. (This flow diagram intends to indicate a sequence and occupancy of nucleons
rather than a sequence of nucleosynthesis.)
of which have the same charge radius and additional mass contained within a base 6Li ring. Here, the
additional neutron of 13C is included within the 12C structure and, therefore, has a charge radius
essentially identical to 12C. The relative abundance of 13C (two orders of magnitude less than 12C)
suggests that the additional neutron may not confer structural durability, unlike the neutron inclusions
of 7Li and 11B.
While a neutron added to 12C results in a stable product, a proton added to 12C may be disfavored
for coulombic reasons, given the positive charge on both the 12C nucleus and the proton, and given that
unstable 13N (figure 5) would be left with an unfavorable ratio of protons > neutrons. The addition of a
proton to 13C, however, results in greater stability as this additional proton links to the central neutron
to form a pn SRC pair. After calculating the center of mass (COM) and the distance from the COM to
the farthest qualitative quark position, the best fit to the experimental radius of 14N places the SRC on a
third parallel partial ring (figure 5). The model radius prediction of 2.61 fm is a close match to the value
accepted by the IAEA 2.5582(0.0070) fm. [7] An additional neutron to 13C results in an unstable neutronneutron interaction to form unstable, radioactive 14C (figure 5). (The addition of individual nucleons is
not intended to indicate nucleosynthetic reactions but rather to indicate a steric role for the sequence and
occupancy of nucleons.)
As the sequence progresses, the addition of a neutron to the third parallel partial ring of 14N creates
a second pn PRC pair with the proton already there, yielding 15N whose predicted radius of 2.61 fm
matches the value accepted by the IAEA of 2.6058 (0.0080) fm. Importantly, the addition of a proton to
14
N would also create a pn PRC pair, but forms unstable 15O (figure 5). In this case, the addition of the
proton is disfavored for coulombic reasons due to an unfavorable ratio of protons > neutrons.
The model structure of 15N has a three-nucleon npn sequence on a third incomplete ring bound to
12
a C. The addition of a proton to either of the two neutrons already present on the third ring enhances
overall stability by creating a pn PRC pair to form stable 16O, with a predicted radius of 2.61fm as
compared to an experimental radius of 2.6991(0.0052) fm. [7] Conversely, there is no placement of an
additional neutron that would create a pn PRC pair. The steric structure of 15N thus selects which type

of nucleon may be added to form the next stable nuclide. Figure 5 illustrates a steric selection role in
predicting nuclide stability.
The model structure of 16O contains a complete 12C double ring plus a third partially-filled ring
containing a sequence of four alternating nucleons beginning with a neutron and ending with a proton
(figure 5, upper right). The addition of either a proton to one end or a neutron to the other could create
a stable pn PRC pair. However, an additional proton would result in an unstable ratio of protons >
neutrons, so the addition of a neutron is favored. The next stable nuclide is thus 17O with a predicted
radius of 2.73 fm, compared to an experimental value of 2.6932(0.0075) fm. [7]
The structure of 17O contains a 12C double ring and a sequence of five alternating nucleons. The
sequence begins and ends with a neutron. Per the aforementioned selection rules, the addition of a proton
would bind to both these neutrons, close the ring, and create two new pn PRC pairs. The resulting
structure is unstable, however. The predicted structure of 18F has a 6Li ring stacked on a 12C ring. We
propose that the instability of 18F relates to the node/antidote vibration of 6Li (see above), precluding an
effective interaction with 12C. The next stable nuclide in the sequence is 18O, whose structure is identical
to 17O but with an additional neutron inside the nuclear cylinder. The predicted radius of 18O is 2.74 fm,
while the IAEA-accepted radius is 2.7726(0.0056) fm.
Predicted versus experimental charge radii of subsequently described nuclides are featured in
Table 1. The intent is to describe the sequence and occupancy of nucleons and not to describe
nucleosynthetic processes.
The addition of a proton to 18O results in two additional pn SRCs within the next stable nuclide,
which is 19F. The model predicts a 6Li ring stacked on a 12C ring. The structure is similar to 18F, but the
node/antidote vibration of 6Li may be stabilized by the additional neutron in a manner analogous to the
role of the tethering neutron in 11B. The addition of a proton to this tethering neutron results in 20Ne,
comprising a pn SRC pair atop a triplet of 6Li rings. The addition of either a proton or a neutron to 20Ne
could create a stable pn PRC pair. However, an additional proton would result in an unstable ratio of
protons > neutrons, so the addition of a neutron is favored to produce 21Ne. The model then predicts that
only the addition of a proton has the potential to form a pn SRC pair, but the resulting 22Na is unstable
for reasons not anticipated by the model. Thus, a neutron is added to form 22Ne. The additional model
is not able to form a stable NN interaction with the npn sequence of 21Ne but may be included in the
center. The addition of a proton forms two stable pn PRCs on an incomplete 4th ring to form 23Na, as
shown in Table 1. An additional neutron completes the 4th ring to form 24Mg. An added neutron is
included in the cylinder space to form 25Mg. As with 21Ne, the model anticipates the addition of a proton,
but this would form unstable 26Al. Instead, a second neutron is included within 26Mg. The addition of a
proton results in two additional pn PRCs for 27Al within a three-nucleon npn sequence on a 5th
incomplete ring. An additional neutron to either end of the npn sequence would result in a pn SRC to
form 28Si. The subsequent addition of either a proton or a neutron to the other could create a stable pn
PRC pair, but the neutron is favored (resulting in 29Si) because an additional proton would create an
unstable ratio of protons > neutrons. The model then predicts the addition of a proton to 29Si, but 30P is
unstable for reasons perhaps similar to the instability of 18F. The next stable nuclide thus adds a neutron
to form 30Si. An additional proton forms two additional pn SRCs and completes the 5th ring of 31P,
followed by the addition of another proton to form 32S, resulting in another pn SRC pair. The subsequent
addition of either a proton or a neutron to 32S could create a stable pn PRC pair, but an additional proton
would result in an unstable ratio of protons > neutrons. Thus, an additional neutron is favored to produce
33
S. Similar to the previous, the model then predicts that only the addition of a proton has the potential
to form a pn SRC pair, but the resulting 34Cl is unstable for reasons not anticipated by the model. Thus,
a neutron is added to form 34S. An additional proton results in an additional pn SRC pair within 35Cl,
followed by the addition of a proton, which completes the 6th ring and forms two additional pn SRCs
within 36Ar.
2.1. Rotational considerations in radius prediction.
Any rotation in a three-dimensional space can be analyzed using a combination of the three principal
axes. [36] Where a rigid body has an axis of symmetry, this axis will correspond to a principal axis of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2mrns ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3887-2966 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

rotation. The most stable rotational axis is where the greatest mass is distributed the farthest from the
rotational axis, and rotation about this major inertia axis corresponds to the minimal kinetic energy.
The model assumes that a nucleus rotates in space and that the manner of rotation determines its
spatial extent and, therefore, its radius. The radii of most light nuclides are best predicted by end-overend tumbling rotation (indicated by italics and preceded by rT in Table 1), in which case the radius is
determined by the distance from its center of mass to its farthest average quark position. This implies a
radius of rotation through the nucleus center of mass and orthogonal to the length of the model nuclear
cylinder. In some of the lightest nuclides, rotation may look more like the wobble of a plate spinning on
a table just before it comes to rest. This type of rotation is called precession, and the method of radius
determination assumes the rotational radius is half the distance between the two average quark positions
farthest from one another within the proposed nuclide structure. The rotational axis, in this case, passes
through the geometric center of the base 6Li ring and is orthogonal to the geometric plane occupied by
the 6Li ring. For many of the nuclides 7Li through 16O, the manner of rotation didn’t make a difference
to the radius prediction. However, in the cases of 14N, 15N, and 16O, the precessing radius (rP)
determinations of 2.61, 2.61, and 2.61 fm (respectively) were a better fit to experimental than the
tumbling radius predictions of 2.79, 2.84, and 2.80 fm (respectively). The experimental charge radius of
16
O (2.70 fm) is halfway between the precessing prediction of 2.61 fm and the tumbling prediction of
2.80 fm and may represent a mix of the two rotational states. As an aside, the manner of rotation may
be a factor in a nuclide’s nuclear magnetic moment.

Figure 6. Model charge radius predictions demonstrate
strong positive correlation with IAEA-accepted charge radii
(black solid line), (r(31)=.98, p<.001).
3. Results
As shown in figure 6, predicted radii of the proposed structures of the stable nuclides through 35Cl
correlate well with experimental except for gaps around 6Li, 19F, and 24Mg. The radii of these structures
derive from the formula of a regular polygon, the proton's radius, the hadron's shape, and proton-neutron
separation as determined by the NN potential. The sequence and occupancy of nucleons within proposed
structures was predicated on the stability of the pn SRC pair and a stable ratio of neutrons ≥ protons.
Within Table 1, each nuclide is enclosed in a box, and below each nuclide symbol is the cosmic
abundance cited as the number of atoms relative to silicon, set arbitrarily at one million (1 x 106). The
isotopic percentage within an element is shown in parenthesis below this, and for elements that have
only one stable isotope, such as 23Na, the number is 100%. Below the graphic depiction of each
cylindrical nuclide is the IAEA-accepted charge radius in bold, followed by the model-predicted radius
in italics. The assumption here is that nuclei are rotating in space, and the manner of rotation can be

either end-over-end tumbling (rT) or precessing (rP), as discussed above. Below the charge radius
prediction is the nucleon separation energy, which is determined from the difference in total binding
energy between the nuclide of interest and the previous stable nuclide (1 amu lighter).
The bottom number in each nuclides box is the nuclear magnetic moment (µ), an experimentally
determined value. [37] It is thought to derive from the spin of nucleons and their quarks but is not simply
the sum of quark magnetic moments. [38] While spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum, the
nuclear magnetic moment also depends on orbital angular momentum, which relates to how a nucleus
rotates in space. [39] This is particularly relevant when considering that the best-fit manner of rotation
of most nuclides in Table 1 is a tumbling rotation; for others, it is precessing, and for some it can be
either. The µ equals zero due to nucleon pairing effects when the numbers of protons and neutrons are
both even. Since stable nuclides through 36Ar increase one nucleon at a time, every other magnetic
moment will equal zero, beginning with 16O. Otherwise, the nuclear magnetic moment µ is unique for
each nuclide and varies in sign and magnitude as mass number increases.
The key to Table 1 is shown in the table’s lower right corner. Neutrons are white, and protons are
red. The table begins with 7Li, corresponding to the linear portion of the radius-to-mass plot depicted in
figure 1. Beginning with 7L, structures evolve by the incremental and predictable addition of nucleons
and demonstrate a structural periodicity that recurs every 12 nuclides, as shown. This is in contrast to
the irregular shapes of the lightest nuclides depicted in the lower right of the table. Structural periodicity
corresponds to columnar trends in nucleon binding energies and nuclear magnetic moments, to be
discussed in greater detail below.
The Roman numerals across the top of Table 1 refer to the “anisotrope” group number, defined
in this context as the number of nucleons common to the anisotropic end of each nuclide in a column.
The anisotrope is depicted in red and white nucleons, while the other end of the nuclear cylinder remains
essentially inert and is depicted in gray and pink nucleons below the anisotrope. With the exception of
the boron nuclides, the anisotrope group number additionally corresponds to the unique nucleon
configurations present on the evolving end of the anisotropic cylinder. As described in the Model
section, the anisotrope guides the sequence and occupancy of nucleons, and best-fit radii result when
nucleons are added only to the anisotrope end of the evolving nuclear cylinder. As there are twelve

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2mrns ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3887-2966 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

anisotrope groups (Roman numerals), the anisotrope configurations include up to 12 nucleons arranged
within up to two stacked 6-nucleon rings.
There are three Periods listed down the left side of Table 1. The structure of the anisotrope
generally evolves in the same way across each Period by adding one nucleon at a time in a predictable
configuration. The boron isotopes 10B and 11B represent an exception; however, their smaller-thanexpected experimental radii present a challenge to structural elucidation, which was resolved by placing
a 4He ring nucleus within the center of each, as shown. This structural contortion and potential weakness
in the structure may account for boron’s low cosmic abundance (discussed previously). [40] As an aside,
the inclusion of neutrons and alpha particles within the center of the nuclide may set a precedent for the
increased density of nuclide structures above 36Ar.
The eight equinucleonic (Z=N) nuclides through 36Ar exhibit a chiral bilateral plane of symmetry
(double blue line) and comprise 99.5% of polynucleonic baryonic matter. Above 35Cl, however,
structural symmetry is no longer a sensitive and specific predictor of abundance. Within the model,36Ar
is point-symmetrical but comprises only 0.3% of elemental Ar, while 40Ar is argon’s most abundant
isotope at 99.66%. The equal numbers of protons and neutrons in 6Li do not result in a rigid, symmetrical
nucleus through which a plane of symmetry may be drawn. 10B is also asymmetrical in spite of its equal
protons/neutron numbers (as shown), precluding a plane of symmetry. Nuclei containing a neutron
inclusion, such as 13C, are symmetrical but do not contain a chiral plane of symmetry in which protons
reflect neutrons on opposite sides of a chiral plane of symmetry.
4. Discussion
The alternating nucleon structures featured in Table 1 were assembled using first principles and
empirically accepted nucleon size, shape, and distance of separation, guided by the known stability of
the proton-neutron NN interaction. The final step in structural elucidation was the vetting of a
structure’s calculated predicted radius against the experimental charge radius, and the structures
correlating best with IAEA-accepted charge radii were included in Table 1. Compliance with accepted
charge radii generated a mix of symmetrical and asymmetrical structures, and bilateral structural
symmetry emerges as a sensitive and specific predictor of light nuclide abundance.
4.1. The 12-nuclide periodicity.
The sequence of stable light nuclides progresses one amu (nucleon) at a time, skipping the five and
eight-amu nuclides. The process of structural elucidation proceeded the same way. According to the
method described above, each provisional nuclide was vetted against the experimental charge radius,
and the one correlating most closely with the experimental appears in Table 1. During the process of
elucidation, certain structural patterns emerged, recurring with predictable periodicity. Starting from an
open ring, the next nucleon would occupy the center, the second added nucleon would pull the center
nucleon onto a parallel ring, and the sequence would add nucleons incrementally to become three, four,
and five nucleon sequences before finally adding a sixth nucleon to complete a parallel six-nucleon ring
identical to 6Li. The process would then repeat itself.
Within the nuclides 7Li, 13C, 19F, 25Mg, and 31P, each successive nuclide is 6 amu greater than the
last. The anisotrope of each structure is the same, each having a single neutron within a nucleus
comprising one or more complete rings, and the five nuclides display structural periodicity. If nuclear
physical properties spring from nuclear structure the way that the atomic physical properties (like
ionization energy or ionic radius) derive from electron orbital structure, then nuclear properties (such as
µ and nucleon separation energy) should exhibit respective periodicity. The µ’s of these five nuclides
are (respectively) +3.26, +0.702, +2.63, -0.855, and +1.13, while the respective nucleon separation
energies (in MeV) are 7.2, 5.0, 10.5, 7.3, and 12.4. Neither sequence reflects clear trends in µ or nucleon
separation energy, however. Neither do the other six nucleon sequences beginning with 8Be, 9Be, 10B,
11
B, and 12C exhibit convincing trends in nucleon separation energy, or non-zero trends in µ.
This is in contrast to the evidence for columnar trends in µ and nucleon separation energy in Table
1, organized around 12-nucleon periodicity. Group I, for example, demonstrates an increasing trend in
nucleon separation energy and a decreasing trend in µ. The columnar trends in the nuclear magnetic
moment tend to decrease in magnitude down an anisotrope group while maintaining the sign or staying

at zero, with the exception of groups VII and IX, in which the sign differs between periods. The sign
disparity in groups VII and IX between Periods I and II may relate to the effects of precessing rotation
on the magnetic moments of the Period One nuclides.
These trends are not like the two-dimensional trends found in the Periodic Table of the Elements
(such as ionization energy or atomic radius), which trend in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
As Table 1 demonstrates, nuclear trends in nucleon separation energy are one-dimensional and confined
to a column. The trends vary from group to group but exhibit a conspicuous pattern. The trend is
downward in group I, and upward in group II. Thereafter, the trends alternate regularly by two so that
the trend in groups III and IV is up, groups V and VI down, groups VII and VIII up, groups IX and X
down, and finally, groups XI and XII up. The cause of this pattern warrants further investigation.
4.2. en bloc movement of nucleon substrates
The correlation between the accepted nuclear radius and the prediction is statistically near-perfect but
falls short for the nuclides 6Li, 19F, 20Ne, 23Na, and the three stable isotopes of magnesium. In figure 6,
these nuclides represent gaps between the model prediction (red dashed line) and the experimental
charge radius (solid black line), and model predictions underestimate the experimental radius. The
underestimation may result from the on-bloc movement of nucleon substructures. The proposed
structure of 19F may contain two distinct substructures: a 7Li bound to a 12C. The low abundance of 19F
may suggest that the association is relatively fragile if each substructure possesses the capacity to move
independently relative to the other. The 7Li may sublux or slide over the top of the 12C, resulting in an
elongation of the experimental radius. The structure of 24Mg may comprise a bound state of two 12C
nuclei, the nucleons of each moving en bloc relative to the other. One 12C might sublux over the other
during nuclear rotation, resulting in elongation and a larger-than-predicted experimental charge radius.
A ≈0.3 fm lateral shift of one 12C relative to the other would be sufficient to bring the predicted radius
of 24Mg (2.82 fm) in line with the experimental (3.06 fm).
4.3. Steric selection anomalies
There are seven (out of 33) instances where the model predicts that the addition of a proton will result
in the next stable nuclide, but instead, the addition of a neutron results in the next stable nuclide. The
deuteron adds a proton to produce stable 3He, for example, whereas the model anticipates the addition
of a neutron to form a triton (which is unstable). In another example, the model’s steric selection
mechanism anticipates the addition of a proton to 7Li to produce 8Be, but 8Be is unstable. Likewise, the
model anticipates the addition of a proton to 17O, 21Ne, 25Mg, 29Si, and 33S, but in each of these five
instances, the stable isotope arises instead from the addition of a neutron resulting in 18O, 22Ne, 26Mg,
30
Si, and 34S. In total, the model’s steric selection mechanism predicts the next stable nuclide in 26 of
the 33 instances. Importantly, the nuclides resulting from these 26 successful predictions constitute
99.39% of the ordinary polynucleonic matter of the universe by mass, while the seven nuclides resulting
from the unanticipated addition of a neutron constitute a scant 0.09% of the polynucleonic mass of the
universe.
5. Conclusion
The vast majority of ordinary baryonic matter aside from hydrogen comprises just eight nuclides:
&
"# "&
"!
#%
#&
#$
'#
#He, !C, (N, $O, "%Ne, "#Mg, "&Si, and "!S. They all contain equal numbers of protons and neutrons.
The relevance of these “Big Eight” nuclides to a complete understanding of nuclear science cannot be
overstated.
Symmetry is ubiquitous in nature, and evidence abounds that structural symmetry confers
structural stability. [41] [42] [43] [44] Within the model, bilateral structural symmetry develops as a
sensitive and specific predictor of nuclide abundance, and structural asymmetry emerges as a predictor
of cosmic scarcity. The conclusion of this paper is that matter aggregates in alternating nucleon
sequences to optimize the formation of stable NN interactions and maximize the number of pn SRC
pairs. Nuclides having equal numbers of protons and neutrons intrinsically contain the maximum
number of pn SRC pairs. The alternation of nucleons implicitly generates the observed equal numbers
of protons and neutrons within the most abundant forms of matter. Within the model, the equality of

proton/neutron numbers manifests as structural symmetry, conferring to the eight superabundant
equinucleonic nuclides sufficient kinetic stability to withstand highly exothermic Big Bang or stellar
nuclear reaction conditions and emerge in high relative cosmic abundance.
