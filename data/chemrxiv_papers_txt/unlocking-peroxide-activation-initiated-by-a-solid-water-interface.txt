Abstract:

14

Activation of the peroxide (O–O) bond at a solid-liquid interface is a key aspect of

15

biological and chemical oxidation reactions due to its fundamental role. An oxidation

16

mechanism exemplified by typical Fenton-like persulfate-based heterogeneous

17

oxidation, in which electron transfer dominates, is almost universally accepted.

18

However, we present experimental results that challenge this view. At a solid-liquid

19

interface, we show that protons are thermodynamically coupled to electrons. In situ

20

quantitative titration yielded direct experimental evidence that the coupling ratio of

21

protons to transferred electrons was 1:1, indicating a net proton-coupled electron

22

transfer in which both the proton and electron enter the redox cycle. These findings will

23

inform future developments in peroxide activation technologies, enabling more

24

efficient redox activity via tight coupling of protons and electrons.

25

One-Sentence Summary:

26

At a solid-water interface, activation of the persulfate O–O bond actually occurs by the

27

coupled transport of both proton and electron equivalents rather than by pure electron

28

transfer.

30

Transition metal–mediated O–O bond activation plays pivotal roles in many

31

biological and chemical oxidation reactions, which are particularly important for

32

sustainable solutions to the problems currently faced by modern society (1–10).

33

Chemical oxidation using metal oxide materials (MOx) at solid-solution interfaces [e.g.,

34

redox processes used for sustainable water treatment (2,11)] are typically described

35

using the redox paradigm. However, the electron transfer (ET)–centered view of redox

36

reactions is increasingly challenged in the context of reaction thermochemistry (12–14)

37

because chemical bonds are formed or broken via the temporary addition or removal of

38

electrons. In such instances, an electron may be transferred in conjunction with a proton,

39

through a mechanism termed proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) (15,16). This

40

interdependent coupling occurs when the free energy perturbations associated with ET

41

at the interface of a redox system cannot be disregarded (12,17,18). The coupling

42

implies that the initial and final states of ET significantly differ because of non-zero

43

nuclear reorganization (i.e., solvent reorganization and/or ion transfer). Here, we focus

44

on charge-compensated cation coupling, in which the free energy of ET reflects the

45

characteristics of the cations, rather than the intrinsic properties of MOx. This coupling

46

ensures that thermodynamic equilibrium is reached, thereby implying that PCET is

47

thermodynamically preferred. However, such joint participation of electrons and

48

protons conflicts with the prevailing view of an interfacial redox reaction, in which the

49

fundamental nature of the reaction is regarded as the addition or removal of electrons

50

(i.e., pure ET). Despite extensive research regarding redox bond-making/breaking at

51

solid-solution interfaces (19–21), there remains a lack of knowledge concerning the

52

coupled proton transfer (PT) and ET of redox processes used for sustainable water

53

treatment (2,11); this lack of knowledge hinders improvement. This study explicitly

54

demonstrates that proton coupling at a solid-solution interface typically accompanies

55

ET, stimulating further investigation of how redox water treatments could be improved.

O–O bond at a solid-water interface is initiated by two interlinked redox half-reactions. The first,
termed (A), is the transition from M(m+n)+ [high-valent metal (–oxo) species] to Mm+ (low-valence
metal), which serves as a key process in the oxidation of model pollutants. The second is (B), the
transition from Mm+ to M(m+n)+, which involves cleavage of the O–O bond. The conventional
categorization of oxidation pathways as (C) ETP and (D) OAT, which focuses primarily on electron
transfer, is inadequate because it does not include the formation of high-valent metal (–oxo) species.
The (E) HAT hypothesis is untenable because it assumes that the proton and electron originate and
terminate in the same bond. In the case of transition metal-mediated O–O bond activation at a solidwater interface, the electron (e–) is typically found occupying the available d-state at the metal site,
while the proton (H+) attaches to the interfacial O atom. The volcano plot of the apparent rate
constant (kapp in L min–1 g–1) versus pH and the molar ratio of consumed PMS to removed PhOH
for (F) CuO, (G) NiO, and (H) Co3O4 is shown here for mean values and error bars. Error bars
indicate the standard deviation of duplicate measurements (n = 2). Experimental conditions: [PMS]
= 0.3 mM, [PhOH] = 0.15 mM, catalyst = 0.2 g L–1, T = 25 ± 2 °C, 0.2 M borate or glycine buffer.

75

Persulfate-based heterogeneous oxidation is a prototypical and extensively studied

76

redox wastewater treatment process (22–25) (Fig. S1). In the present study, we study

77

this well-defined Fenton-like reaction system, which ensures water safety. Benchmark

78

MOx-based

79

peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HO–OSO3–) and peroxydisulfate (PDS, O3SO–OSO32–) (Fig.

80

S2)—enabling the linkage of MOx metal redox transformation to the oxidation of

81

organic pollutants. The process can be subdivided into high-valent, metal-induced, non-

82

radical oxidation steps (Figs. 1A and 1B). This process has created a paradigm shift in

83

the water treatment field; the historical focus on pollution control has shifted toward a

84

more sustainable approach that incorporates resource recovery (26,27). This shift

85

changed the mode of organic elimination from mineralization (associated with

86

production of CO2 and H2O) to polymerization, enabling water purification to be

87

associated with low-level carbon emissions (2,3,28). Using this knowledge, significant

88

advances have been made in the development of sustainable water treatments (2,3,28).

89

However, the high-valent, metal-induced, oxidation mechanism remains unclear; there

90

are three currently recognized oxidation pathways (29): An electron-transfer process

91

(ETP), hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) (Figs. 1C–E).

92

All primarily involve redox-driven ET; the coupled protons have been largely

93

overlooked. We hypothesize that PT, similar to ET, occurs at a solid-water interface.

94

The present study examines the proton-coupled nature of well-characterized

95

interfacial redox reactions, with a particular focus on persulfate-based heterogeneous

96

oxidation. The volcano relationship between the rate constant and the pH, exemplified

97

by one benchmark MOx-based catalyst (CuO), is confirmed. Mechanistic studies

98

indicate that activation of the persulfate O–O bond is only mediated by interfacial Cu

99

sites via a concerted PCET (CPET) pathway, yielding high-valent metal (–oxo) species

100

(CuIII) that serve as key intermediates during the oxidation of model pollutants

101

including phenol (PhOH) and 2,6-dimethylphenol (2,6-M-PhOH) to organic radicals.

102

Thus, both processes facilitate radical polymerization at a solid-water interface. The

103

catalytic activity during oxidative polymerization is affected by the proton activity (pH);

104

pH significantly alters the activity (up to 46.33-fold for CuIII). Quantitative acid–base

105

titrations tracking the evolution of [H+] reveal that, during CPET, the H+/e–

106

stoichiometry is almost 1:1. Changes in pH affect the CPET process of other benchmark

107

MOx (NiO and Co3O4) and thus the oxidation activities of NiIV=O and CoIV=O.

108

Oxidative polymerization can be extended to another typical aromatic, aniline, yielding

109

organic polymers; these results demonstrate the generalizability of CPET in terms of

110

initiating radical polymerization at a solid-water interface.

111

Mechanisms solely focused on ET do not explain the non-monotonic kinetic/pH

112

dependencies

113

Our study began with pH activity profiling (Figs. 1F–H) in a batch reactor with

114

representative reactants: benchmark MOx (CuO, NiO, and Co3O4) (30), a persulfate

115

oxidant, and model pollutants. The studied pH range is detailed in Note S1. The

116

catalytic activity of the model CuO-activated PMS process (Fig. S3) expressed as an

117

apparent rate constant (kapp in L min–1 g–1) (Fig. S4) is not pH-dependent (PCET

118

predicted either a volcanic or caldera-shaped kinetic dependence on pH) (14,31–33); a

119

similar result has been previously reported (34) (Note S2). We hypothesized that the

120

discrepancy could be resolved by considering the instantaneous change in interfacial

121

proton concentration (35) triggered by a reaction-induced local pH shift. One potential

122

solution might utilize borate and glycine buffers, which attenuate the nearly interfacial

123

local pH gradient within acceptable tolerances (Note S3). A novel finding emerged

124

under well-buffered conditions: a large kinetic pH effect manifested as a kinetic gap of

125

approximately two orders of magnitude (46.33-fold) (Figs. 1F, S5 and Table S1).

126

Critically, a failure to consider the interfacial and bulk solution pH gradients can mask

127

identification of this effect, leading to the commonly observed weak rate-pH scaling

128

effect (Note S4). Another potentially counterintuitive result was the non-monotonic

129

nature of the pH-dependent kinetics; the maximum kapp occurred at a unique inflection

130

point of pH 6.2 (Figs. 1F, S5 and Table S1). The volcano-shaped activity versus pH

131

profiles of other benchmark catalysts, including NiO and Co3O4 (Figs. 1G, 1H, S6, S7

132

and Table S1), provide further evidence to support this conclusion. These profiles show

133

that the pH-dependent activity variations described above are common. Such pH-

134

determined behavior indicates proton activity at the solid-water interface. This proton

135

activity has not yet been considered by researchers focused on typical interfacial redox

136

reactions, such as persulfate-based oxidations. The non-monotonic kinetic/pH

137

dependencies cannot be fully explained by the conventional ET-focused view; it is

138

essential to consider PCET.

139

Unnoticed PT at a solid-water interface

140

To identify previously unrecognized protons, we used electron equivalents that

141

could resolve the reaction path. Electron conservation is not consistent with the

142

conventional radical-oxidation/pollutant-mineralization mechanism (Fig. 1F, Table S2

143

and Note S5) (11,36); non-radical oxidation is also involved, as indicated by the near-

144

unity molar ratio of consumed PMS to removed phenol as the pH increases from 6.0 to

145

9.0 when CuO is utilized (Fig. 1F). This phenomenon was expected (26). However, the

146

relative importance of the radical and non-radical paths remains unclear. Chemical

147

oxygen demand (COD) measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed

148

that non-radical oxidation explained > 81.51% of PhOH removal (see Methods S1–3,

and Fig. S8). Semi-quantitative electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and

150

radical-probing experiments [using benzoic acid (37,38) and iopromide (39) to probe

151

for ·OH/SO4•− and SO4•−, respectively] (Methods S4 and Figs. S9, S10) showed

152

that ·OH, SO4•−, O2•−, and 1O2—in either the bulk solution or surface-bound form—

153

were not engaged in oxidation. Radicals explained less than 19.12% of PhOH oxidation

154

(Note S6); the non-radical pathway is the primary mechanism, rather than a supporting

155

mechanism.

formation is of the PhO· intermediate. (C) EPR spectra of the CuO/PMS system at pH 6.8, 7.4, and

175

Next, we explored the intermediates and products of the non-radical pathway. The

176

surface-accumulated PhOH oxidation product was a crosslinked polymer (Fig. S8) that

177

did not peel from the surface into the solvent (Note S7). We inferred that a reactive

178

phenoxy radical (PhO·) intermediate (not yet directly detected) explains formation of

179

the crosslinked polymer (Note S8), considering that PhOH exhibits three active H-sites

180

(at the ortho-/para-positions of phenolic–OH). If this inference is correct, concealment

181

of two-thirds of the H-sites (at the two ortho-positions) might hinder crosslinking. We

182

thus implemented a hypothesis-driven approach; we modified PhOH to 2,6-M-PhOH

183

(with only one active H-site in the para-position). As expected, 91.06% of 2,6-M-PhOH

184

was converted into non-crosslinked products (Methods S5–7, and Fig. S11).

185

Specifically, 33.82% of products were chain-like polyphenyl ethers (formed via C–O

186

polymerization) (Figs. 2A and S12), whereas 57.24% of products were 3,3′,5,5′-

187

tetramethyldiphenoquinone (created via C–C coupling) (Fig. 2B and S13); all products

188

formed via oxidation of 2,6-M-PhOH. The polymerization and coupling products were

189

identified using COD measurements, TGA, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization

190

time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), gel permeation chromatography

191

(GPC), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Figs. 2A, 2B, S12–

192

S14 and Note S9). The predominant PhO· intermediate (> 91.06%) is similar to those

193

previously reported (2,26). Importantly, the oxidation of PhOH to yield PhO· involves

194

a PT (40,41); this aspect cannot be disregarded.

195

We next sought to identify the active site for conversion of PhOH to PhO·. This

196

site engages in selective oxidation of primary organic pollutants; the removal

197

efficiencies differ between electron-rich (with electron-donating groups, -OH and/or -

198

NH2) and electron-deficient (with electron-withdrawing groups, -COOH and/or -NO2)

199

organics (Fig. S15). Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra resemble volcanoes (Fig.

200

S16), suggesting that CuIII is the critical intermediate initiating PhO· generation. This

201

suggestion is supported by previous results (25) and our EPR spectra (Fig. 3C) that

202

revealed the typical seven-line EPR signal of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidone-N-oxyl

203

(DMPOX) was produced via oxidation of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)

204

by CuIII. The formation of DMPOX entails the exclusion of 1O2 and abrupt generation

205

of a substantial quantity of ·OH, as described in Figure S9 and Note S10. The

206

pronounced pH-dependent correlation between kinetic activity (Fig. S5) and EPR peak

207

height (Fig. 3C) indicates that low-valent CuII undergoes oxidation to high-valent CuIII

208

in a pH-dependent manner. A similar conclusion can be drawn regarding the final

209

oxidation products of methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO); these are biphenyl compounds

210

or hydroxylated products, as revealed by spectrally matched LC-MS (Fig. S17), and

211

they were previously suspected to result from direct CuIII oxidation (25). Ultraviolet–

212

visible spectral analysis revealed a transient CuIII–periodate complex (42,43) (Fig. 3D

213

and Note S11), providing additional evidence to support our conclusion. Next, we

214

conducted open-circuit potential versus time (OCPT) tests (Method S8 and Fig. S18) to

215

track the efficiency of the CuIII-to-CuII transition with and without PhOH. Prior to

216

PhOH addition, the dominant valence state was that of electrochemically generated

217

CuIII. However, the accelerated CuIII quenching upon addition of PhOH indicated that

218

CuIII produced PhO· through oxidation of PhOH. The key role of CuIII was substantiated

219

by addition of a CuIII quencher (Fig. S19), after which phenol polymerization ceased.

220

Thus, PhO· production reflects oxidation by CuIII.

221

Evaluations of other benchmark MOx, thus NiO and Co3O4, revealed that high-

222

valence NiIV=O and CoIV=O were kinetically competent oxidants, associated with

223

97.35% (NiIV=O) and 91.83% (CoIV=O) PhOH oxidation to PhO·. The details are

224

presented in Figures 1G, 1H, and S20. These results are comparable to the

225

approximately 100% PhOH-to-PhO· reactions catalyzed by transition metal (Cu, Ni,

226

Co, and Fe) single-atom catalysts (2). Our experiments show that high-valent metal (–

227

oxo) species (CuIII, NiIV=O, and CoIV=O) are key intermediates of PhOH

228

coupling/polymerization; they extract an H-atom (H•) from PhOH to generate

229

PhO· (Eqs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, our research platform enabled investigation of how

Fig. 3. Evidence for the CPET mechanism controlling the activation of the O–O bond initiated
by a solid-water interface. A comprehensive CPET mechanism consists of two coupled redox halfreactions. The first reaction (A) is the oxidation of PhOH to PhO·, which involves the abstraction
of H• from PhOH by the electrophilic CuIII, accompanied by the reduction of CuIII to CuII. In contrast,
the latter (B) is characterized by the formation of CuIII from CuII through heterolytic O–O bond
activation, where the molar ratio of transferred electrons to coupled protons is close to 1:1, as shown
in this study. This indicates that the interfacial O–H bond is directly involved in the oxidation of
CuII to CuIII. This suggests that the O–H bond is simultaneously broken in response to the temporary
removal of an electron from CuII to CuIII. This, in turn, suggests that the conversion of CuIII to CuII
corresponds to the formation of O–H bonds, as shown in A. The capture and quantification of the
coupled protons were achieved by the implementation of an appropriately performed liquid-phase
acid–base titration for (C) CuO/PMS (experimental conditions: [PMS] = 0.1 mM, [CuO] = 2.0 g L–
1), (D) CuO/PDS (conditions: [PDS] = 0.1 mM, [CuO] = 2.0 g L–1), (E) NiO/PMS (conditions:
[PMS] = 0.1 mM, [NiO] = 2.0 g L–1), (F) NiO/PDS (conditions: [PDS] = 0.1 mM, [NiO] = 2.0 g L–

(conditions: [PDS] = 0.1 mM, [Co3O4] = 2.0 g L ). The molar ratio of coupled protons to transferred

253

These results indicate that the formation of the high-valent metal (–oxo) species is significantly
influenced by the stoichiometric proton/electron coupling ratio.

254

Evidence for I-PCET

255

Two general mechanisms, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and CPET (2), involve

256

extraction of H• from PhOH by electrophilic high-valent metal (–oxo) species (CuIII,

257

NiIV=O, and CoIV=O). The low kinetic isotope effect of k [KIE, KIE = kPhOH(H)/kPDOD(D)]

258

(Method S9 and Fig. S21) and its high temperature dependence [i.e., KIE inversion at

259

higher temperatures (32)] (Fig. S22), show that CPET is involved. Thus, the proton (H+)

260

and electron (e–) respectively originate and terminate the distinct bonds. In contrast,

261

HAT requires H+ and e– to both originate and terminate the same bonds (44). In the

262

context of benchmark transition metal oxides (CuO, NiO, and Co3O4), CPET is

263

plausible considering that e– populates the available d states of the metal and H+ attaches

264

to the interfacial O atom (Eq. 3). These observations indicate that oxidation of PhOH

265

to PhO· is a form of coupled H+/e– transfer (1:1 H+:e– stoichiometry), followed by

266

CPET-mediated H+/e– addition to distinct interfacial trapping sites (Fig. 3A). Thus, the

267

high-energy intermediates typically observed during sequential ET and PT steps are

268

absent. The negligible variation in solution pH after high-valent metal (–oxo) species

269

react with PhOH reinforces this conclusion (Fig. S23). Notably, the PCET mechanism

270

involved at a solid-water interface is composed of two interlinked redox half-reactions.

271

The initial reaction is substrate oxidation; a high-valent metal (–oxo) species is the

272

active oxidant (described above) (Figs. 1A and 3A). The second reaction comprises

273

formation of a high-valent metal (–oxo) species via heterolytic O–O bond activation

274

(12) (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, an understanding of the I-PCET process is compromised

275

by the limited data regarding the coupled proton that accompanies the generation of

276

high-valent metal (–oxo) species via O–O bond cleavage. More research focused on

277

this proton is needed.

280

solid-water interfaces did not identify PT (2,25,45). A possible explanation is that

281

reactions mediated by coupled protons tend to be unnoticed because they are ubiquitous.

282

In contrast, the thermochemistry [i.e., energy difference between bonds broken and

283

formed that affects reaction equilibria, typically described using a “square scheme” (Fig.

284

S24) (12,14)] implies that ET and PT are thermodynamically coupled to ensure charge

285

equilibrium (12,18,44). Accordingly, the coupled movement of proton charges

286

compensates for the transferred electrons. The mechanism may be either a concerted

287

PCET [where the H+ and e– are transferred in the same kinetic step (46)], a separate but

288

coupled pathway [PT precedes ET (PTET)], or ET followed by PT (ETPT) (32)). We

289

propose that the formation of a high-valent metal (–oxo) species involves a net PCET,

290

thus comprising an inextricably coupled transfer of e– and H+. Qualitative experimental

291

support for this hypothesis is provided by the model CuO-activated PMS reaction,

292

which is associated with a pH reduction indicating a loss of H+ to solution (Fig. S25).

293

However, quantitative verification has been lacking, partly due to the difficulty

294

associated with determining the H+/e– stoichiometry m/n [an integer ratio according to

295

Dalton’s law (Eq. 4)]. Because the bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) of X–H (Eq.

296

5) is the “gold standard” thermochemical descriptor of I-PCET (12,18,44), it is

297

reasonable to speculate that tight H+/e– coupling involves cleavage of the surface-H

298

bond, increasing pKa (pKa = –logKa, where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) at the

299

surfaces of metal oxides and yielding high-valent metal (–oxo) species upon electron

300

removal (Fig. 1B and 3B). This speculation assumes that H+ generation upon

301

dissociation of the surface-H bond will be stoichiometric, accompanied by ET.

302

Consequently, trapping and quantification of coupled protons (dissociated H+) could

303

directly yield to the critical m/n stoichiometry governing formation of high-valent metal

304

(–oxo) species, enabling a comprehensive understanding of I-PCET. Thus, we present

305

stoichiometric-H+ experimental measurements obtained via appropriate, liquid-phase

306

acid–base titrations (Note S12). We quantify dissociated-H+ levels by determining

307

changes in total surface-hydroxyl density (47,48).

The need for equivalent protons can be represented by ascertaining dissociative

311

H+ behavior in a model of MOx-mediated O–O bond activation/I-PCET half-reaction

312

(Figs. 1B and 3B). In the presence of 0.1 mM HO–OSO3– and excess benchmark MOx

313

(2.0 g L–1 CuO) (Note S13), the overall dissociated-H+ concentration was 0.093 mM,

314

implying a H+/e– molar ratio of 1:2 attributable to O–O bond cleavage along with 2-e–

315

transfer (Figs. 3C, S26 and Table S3). This result conflicts with the predicted 1:1 H+/e–

316

stoichiometry of CuIII formation (12,18,44). Furthermore, an identical but O2-free

317

reaction yielded a similar result (Fig. S27 and Table S3). The contradictory outcomes

318

are attributable to the presence of H+ acceptors in HO–OSO3– (Eqs. 2 and 6); H+

319

transferred to the product-H2O cannot be determined via titration. If this hypothesis is

320

correct, replacement of HO–OSO3– with O3SO–OSO32– via H+-acceptor site-directed

321

mutagenesis might yield a stoichiometrically compatible H+ level (Eqs. 2 and 7). As

322

anticipated, the ratio of transferred e– to coupled H+ was 1:1 (Figs. 3D, S28, S29 and

323

Table S3), confirming the existence of a rigorous solid-water interface PCET in which

324

the O–H bond is directly involved (Fig. 3B). To confirm that this I-PCET was not

325

unusual, we extended the range of high-valent metal (–oxo) species from a form that is

326

typically unstable, thus CuIII (49) (as previously described), to stable complexes

327

(NiIV=O and CoIV=O) (49) and measured the H+/e– ratios of transition-metal-oxide

328

(NiO and Co3O4)-mediated O–O bond activations. As expected, 2-coupled H+ was

329

involved in NiIV=O and CoIV=O formation, linked to 2-e– transfer (Figs. 3E–H, S30–

330

S37 and Table S3). The H+/e– stoichiometry is 1:1, evincing the generality of this I-

331

PCET mechanism.

345

formation of PhO· and high-valent metal (–oxo) species (Note S14), which is relevant

346

in the model CuO-activated PMS context. The duplicated kapp values are plotted as a

347

function of pH in Figure 1F, which reveals the dependence on proton activity. This

348

dependence is confirmed by the fact that log(kapp) (approximately) scales with the

349

Brønsted slope or the Brønsted α with the pH. The α predicted by Marcus theory is

350

approximately 1/2 under the low driving force of a free energy barrier (18,32) (Fig. 4A

351

and Note S15). It is imperative to emphasize that the Brønsted α, which establishes a

352

linear correlation between the logarithm of the CPET rate constant [log(kCPET)] and the

353

logarithm of the equilibrium constant [log(keq)] or the scaled driving force (|ΔG°CPET|)

354

(50), would provide an invaluable insight into the sensitivities of reaction barriers (rates)

355

to changes in free energy (i.e., the driving force) during rate-limiting I-PCET. Figure

356

4A shows that as the pH increases from 6.0, kapp rises in a log-linear manner up to pH

357

6.2, with a slope of 0.46 ± 0.16 log(L min–1 g–1) pH−1; after pH 6.2, kapp decreases with

358

a slope of –0.58 ± 0.07 log(L min–1 g–1) pH−1 up to pH 7.0; and the slope finally becomes

359

–0.51 ± 0.04 log(L min–1 g–1) pH−1 from pH 7.2 to 9.0. Indeed, the initial fractional

360

slope of log(kapp) pH−1 (0.46 ± 0.16) is consistent with an approximately α-1/2 scaling,

361

as predicted by Marcus theory (18,32). This slope suggests that the relationship between

362

log(kapp) and pH is analogous to the plot of log(kCPET) versus log(keq) or the plot of the

363

barrier force versus the CPET driving force, ΔG‡ versus |ΔG°CPET|. These relationships

364

highlight the pivotal role of PT, which agrees with the proposed I-CPET mechanism

365

(14,18,32,51). Moreover, log(kapp) pH−1 scaling, largely independent of buffer

366

concentration (Fig. S38), provides further support for the I-PCET mechanism because

367

it is not perturbed by solvent. However, the electron-only or proton-only pathway is

368

medium-dependent, and charges move (52). Note that the Brønsted slope exhibits an

369

apparently negative α-scaling based on pH [–0.58 ± 0.07 and –0.51 ± 0.04 log(kapp) pH−1]

370

(Fig. 4A) across the extensive pH range of 6.2 to 9.0. The reason for this negative α-

371

scaling is unclear, and further investigations are required.

372

In the widely accepted CPET mechanism, BDFE constitutes the central energetic

373

parameter (12,18,32). We thus hypothesized that a change in ΔG°PT (the free energy for
15

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gvprb ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6089-9837 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

374

PT) according to pH would exhibit a strong correlation with the abovementioned,

375

complex pH dependence. The negative α-scaling of log(kapp) pH−1 reflects the fact that

376

ΔG°PT determines PT-keq (12,32); moreover, ΔG°ET (the free energy for ET) is in close

377

balance with ΔG°PT to maintain a remarkably constant BDFE (18). This constant BDFE

378

indicates that the dependence of ΔG°PT on pH (53) enables ΔG°PT to be tuned via

379

regulation of the acidity and basicity of proton donors and acceptors, respectively. The

380

free energy relationship lends further support to the notion that the rate would exhibit

381

distinct responses to alterations in both ΔG°PT and ΔG°ET. This notion can be adequately

382

described using Marcus-type formulations (54,55). Specifically, if ΔG°PT increases

383

when ΔG°ET is already large, ΔG°CPET may approach the intrinsic barrier (λ) of the

384

CPET, resulting in a rate that is near the peak of the Marcus parabola (32,56). Note also

385

that the irregular dependence of kapp on pH, combined with the pH-varying ΔG°PT,

386

indicates changes in the base and oxidant strengths (ΔG°PT and ΔG°ET). Considering

387

the structural diversity of the Cu-site, and the redox evolution of the site during the

388

catalytic cycle (Figs. 1B and 3B), it is unsurprising that ΔG°PT and ΔG°ET vary,

389

consistent with the fact that the valence state of the Cu-site switches between CuII and

390

CuIII, thereby explaining the variations in ΔG°CPET caused by changes in both ΔG°PT

391

and ΔG°ET. These variations are attributable to differences in base and oxidant strengths

392

of the Cu-site. In particular, CuII and CuIII, which are Lewis acids, vary based on

393

protonation and deprotonation interactions; ΔG°PT disproportionally influences kapp.

394

Because pKa serves as an index of proton-donating ability, substantial changes in the

395

Cu-site pKa during oxidation of CuII to CuIII would modify the relative contributions of

396

ΔG°PT and ΔG°ET to ΔG°CPET. The linear ΔG°CPET could become non-monotonic with

397

respect to pH, based on the co-existence of CuII and CuIII. Indeed, simultaneous

398

deprotonation of CuII and CuIII is promoted at high pH (≥ 6.2). The titrated pKa of CuII

399

is 6.45 ± 0.31 (Fig. S39); the pKa of CuIII is presumably less than 7.0 (Note S16). These

400

disparate pKa values result in two very distinct effects on the ΔG°PT, influencing the

401

CuII-to-CuIII PT responsible for formation of high-valent metal (–oxo) species (ΔG°PT1)

402

(Eq. 8, Figs. 1B and 3B), and on the CuIII-to-CuII PT, triggering PhOH-to-

403

PhO· oxidation (ΔG°PT2) (Eq. 3, Figs. 1A and 3A). Thus, in contrast to ΔG°PT1, which

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gvprb ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6089-9837 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

404

chemically favors a pH increase (from 6.0 to 7.0) (Fig. S39 and Note S17), ΔG°PT2 is

405

chemically unfavorable within the same pH region (Fig. S40). The contributions of

406

ΔG°PT1 and ΔG°PT2 to PT-keq are combined when determining ΔG°PT; these combined

407

contributions explain the negative α-scaling log(kapp) pH−1 correlation. Thus, ΔG°PT,

408

rather than pH, controls the kinetics; ΔG°PT declines as the pH increases from 6.2 to 9.0.

409

The linear correlation between kapp and ΔG°PT is a defining characteristic of an I-PCET

410

reaction. Next, we considered the BDFE, which is conceptually analogous to the free

411

energy sums of pKa and E° (the equilibrium potential at the standard state of proton

412

activity, pH 0) plus the ΔG° for H+ + e–  H• (CG) (12). We thus explored kapp behavior

413

very close to the CuO pKa because if the surface Brønsted-basic site (i.e., surface

414

hydroxides near CuII) served as a proton donor, PT would be exquisitely sensitive to

415

pKa and the inflection point of the volcano-shaped activity profile would

416

(approximately) equal the pKa (12). As anticipated, the experimental pKa was 6.45 ±

417

0.31 (Fig. S39), indicating that the surface Brønsted-basic hydroxide site (also termed

418

the Lewis-acid site redox–linked PT component) participated in PCET in a manner

419

analogous to that of enzyme-catalyzed reactions (57). This finding confirmed that PT

420

plays a pivotal role in the kinetics. The CuIII-to-CuII PT is the reverse of the above steps

421

(Figs. 1A, 3A and Eq. 3). At higher pH values (≥ 6.2), unfavorable protonation of CuIII

422

inhibits PT from PhOH (corresponding to PhOH-to-PhO·) (Fig, S40). Thus, re-

423

reduction of CuIII is regulated by PT. Note that calculation of ΔG°PT is not yet feasible;

424

the structure and energetics of the transition-state CuIII remain unknown. Consequently,

425

it is not possible to build a rigorous mechanistic model that accurately predicts kinetic

426

trends. However, the primary I-PCET thermochemical parameter (i.e., the BDFE that

427

dictates PCET reactivity) can be investigated via slow scan–rate cyclic voltammetry

428

(CV) (58) (Fig. S41). The quasi-reversible Eeq plotted as a function of the applied pH

429

yielded an intercept E° value of 0.405 ± 0.04 V versus a standard hydrogen electrode

430

(SHE) at pH 0; the E° was then converted to a BDFE of 62.1 ± 1.4 kcal mol–1 using a

431

more general form of thermochemical cycling (18) (see Note S18 for details) (Fig. 4E).

432

Together, these outcomes substantiate the fact that PT is coupled with ET via redox Cu-

433

sites, emphasizing the mechanistic attributes of I-PCET.

435

The thermodynamic analyses were further extended to NiIV=O and CoIV=O to

436

emphasize the generality of I-PCET. The volcano-shaped kapp profiles versus pH (Figs.

437

1G and 1H) were fitted to extract the log-linear dependence of kapp on pH and

438

log(kapp) pH−1 slopes. The values for NiIV=O are 0.32 ± 0.01 (pH 5.0 to 8.0) and –0.31

439

± 0.10 (pH 8.0 to 8.8); for CoIV=O, these values are 0.31 ± 0.02 (pH 5.8 to 6.3) and –

440

0.34 ± 0.02 (pH 6.3 to 9.0) (Figs. 4B and 4C). Notably, the Brønsted α values were

441

considerably smaller than the anticipated 1/2 (18,32), indicating that ΔG°CPET

442

substantially increases and then gradually approaches the CPET λ predicted by Marcus

443

theory (18). However, the interpretation of such shallow slopes is unclear, although

444

several recent rate/driving force studies of PCET also showed very small α-values (59–

445

61). The Bernasconi principle of non-perfect synchronization (NPS) (62) assumes that

446

fundamental reactions involving multiple concurrent processes (e.g., electron

447

localization/delocalization and bonding/cleavage) may proceed via “unbalanced” or

448

“asynchronous” transition states (62–64). We thus suggest that the transition state of I-

449

PCET involves concerted transfer of H+ and e–, but in an asynchronous manner. Then,

450

a larger α leads to a more pronounced PT “character” of the transition state and a greater

451

sensitivity to changes in PT-driving forces (65,66). Accordingly, the PT characteristics

452

of the rate-determining transition states may differ among NiIV=O, CoIV=O, and CuIII,

453

reflecting variations in CPET synchronicity. The observed variations in α may indicate

454

one- and/or two-electron valence interconversions at Lewis-acid metal sites. These

455

include CuIII ⇄ CuII (1-e–), CoIV=O ⇄ CoIII/CoII (1- and 2-e–), and NiIV=O ⇄ NiII (2-e–)

456

(switchable electronic states, or “redox isomers”), as well as Lewis-acid metal site–

457

dependent valence tautomerism (67) (with lesser ETs and relatively greater PTs leading

458

to increased α values; for example, CuIII ⇄ CuII associated with more complete PT

459

during CPET compared with CoIV=O ⇄ CoIII/CoII and NiIV=O ⇄ NiII). In contrast to

460

CuIII, the volcano-shaped activity inflection point for NiIV=O occurs at pH 8.0 (Fig. 4B),

461

which considerably differs from the pKa values of NiO (pKa1 = 4.29 ± 0.32, pKa2 = 9.10

462

± 0.22) (Fig. S42). Notably, the NiIV=O inflection point is very close to pHpzc (pHpzc =

463

8.15 ± 0.05 according to quantitative titration) (Fig. S42); this similarity has not been

464

previously reported. To illustrate the importance of the inflection point at pHpzc, the

465

surface Brønsted acid–base characteristics of the model catalyst NiO were manipulated

466

to obtain NiO-air (Figs. S43, S44 and Note S19), and a strikingly analogous outcome

467

was observed (Fig. 4D). The pHpzc (7.55 ± 0.03 of NiO-air according to quantitative

468

titration) affected the activity-inflection point pH (7.6) (Figs. 4D, S43, and S44)). The

469

pHpzc also predicted the activity-inflection point pH of another model catalyst, Co3O4

470

(Fig. S45). One possible explanation is that high-valent metal species require

471

electronically stable oxygenic ligands (NiIV=O and CoIV=O), rather than less stable

472

metal–oxo species (CuIII) (49). Alternatively, the electrostatic effects of a double-layer

473

charge structure may be involved. A deviation from the pHpzc pH triggered double-layer

474

reorganization and thus shifts in ΔG°CPET (68). Moreover, the BDFE values of NiO and

475

Co3O4 were calculated to be 83.2 ± 1.2 and 83.8 ± 1.4 kcal mol–1, respectively (Figs.

476

4E, S46 and S47), thereby emphasizing the explicit dependence on PT.

477

To enhance the overall understanding of I-PCET via transition metal-mediated O–

478

O bond activation, we now summarize the principal mechanistic features that

479

distinguish I-PCET from well-studied reactions such as electrocatalytic PCET (E-PCET)

480

(Note S20), with a primary focus on proton activity (pH), particularly at the solid-liquid

481

interface. One difference is the noncovalent, inner-sphere hydrogen-bonding

482

interaction (Fig. S48); the hydrogen bonding strength between a protic PMS-oxidant

483

and a metal site limits the proton tunnelling rate, thus affecting the generation of high-

484

valent metal (–oxo) species. Furthermore, the I-PCET mechanism is based on the

485

kinetic dependencies of the surface Brønsted acid–base parameters, particularly pKa

486

and pHpzc. This relationship is primarily attributable to changes in free energy, which

487

greatly affect keq. Additionally, in contrast to the electrified interface of E-PCET, where

488

an aqueous electrochemical double layer controls the kinetics and thermodynamics of

489

both PT and ET (69), the solvation interface hosts the chemical potentials of protons

490

and electrons; the potentials are tuned according to the redox potentials of the metal

491

centers (CuIII, NiIV=O, and CoIV=O), thus favoring I-PCET. Finally, I-PCET is defined

492

by concerted but asynchronous PT and ET. The difference in synchronicity of CPET is

493

attributable to the valence tautomerism of the metal center.

494

To further extend polymerizations mediated by persulfate-based oxidation, we

495

examined another typical aromatic, aniline. As expected, PT created organic radicals,

496

followed by crosslinked and polymerization products (Fig. S49). These data illustrate

497

the broad range of organic contaminants that can be polymerized.

498

Conclusions

499

This study highlights the pivotal roles of coupled protons in redox reaction

500

activities at the solid-water interfaces of various persulfate-based, oxidative

501

polymerization model systems. Further research is required to derive a thermochemical

502

model that fully describes the relationship between the reaction rate and the driving

503

force, particularly with respect to how coupled electrons and protons (i.e., net PCET)

504

proceed across a solid-solution interface. Our findings suggest that reaction rates can

505

be increased by modifying the force that drives interfacial PT through pH alteration

506

during the overall PCET reaction. The data also indicate that the principal parameters

507

of benchmark MOx-based catalysts, namely the Lewis acid/base (electron

508

withdrawing/donating) potentials and Brønsted acid/base (proton donor/acceptor)

509

characteristics, govern I-PCET. This enables rational catalyst design.

510

Careful acid–base titration analyses revealed a 1:1 proton:electron stoichiometry

511

regarding the key fundamental components (PT and ET) of interfacial redox reactions.

512

There are two coupled redox half-reactions, comprising the CPETs of CuII-to-CuIII and

513

CuIII-to-CuII. The former reaction forms high-valent metal (–oxo) species, whereas the

514

latter reaction oxidizes PhOH to PhO·. MOx-mediated O–O bond activation proceeds

515
