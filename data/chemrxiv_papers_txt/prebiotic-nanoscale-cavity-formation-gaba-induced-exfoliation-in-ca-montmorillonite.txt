Abstract
We present exfoliation of a crystalline clay induced by the small carbon-chain amino
acid, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), upon adsorption-desorption interaction. We experimentally investigated the interaction between Ca-montmorillonite clay (Ca-Mt)
and GABA, a non-proteinogenic amino acid commonly found in carbonaceous meteorites. Despite evidence of only transient adsorption onto the clay surfaces, GABA
exhibits the capacity to act as an exfoliator. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy reveals a nonreversible structural change of the Ca-Mt aluminosilicate network induced by GABA.
Powder XRD analysis and TEM imaging reveal that localised, partial exfoliation of
the clay layers occurrs after interaction with GABA, creating internal nanoscale cavities in-between adjacent clay layers. These results demonstrate that an elementary,
monomeric species can act as an exfoliating agent in a prebiotically-relevant scenario,
and that in this process, nanoscale confined environments are formed. This work may

to the origin of life on rocky (exo)planets.

Introduction
Since the first exoplanet ratification in 1992, 1 several thousands of exoplanets have been
found, directing the field of prebiotic chemistry into a new era. The quest to decipher
universal mechanisms for the origins of life on terrestrial planets is brought to the fore as we
gain more knowledge of possible planetary environments in habitable zones beyond our Solar
System. 2 One of the major hypotheses on origins of life on Earth is Darwin’s warm little
pond, set in Hadean times, around when first landmasses started to form. 3,4 In this warm
pond scenario, that may be extended to other lifeless rocky planets, organics and minerals
interact in a shallow water environment undergoing dry-wet cycling. 5 This primeval eon is
also thought to have experienced extraterrestrial input of organics, with a period of significant
meteoritic bombardment and dust influx. 4 Through this, off-world organics may be delivered
to planetary surfaces, enriching the prebiotic planetary chemical inventory. 6 Meteoric and
cometary dust studies reveal a fortitude of monomeric biomolecular building blocks, amongst
which are a great variety of amino acids. 7 The contribution of off-world organics is specifically
relevant to the sub-aerial warm pond setting. 8 Studying interactions of common off-world
organics and abundant surface minerals is crucial for gaining insights into processes that
shape prebiotic pond environments and more generally, on life as a universal phenomenon.
Clay minerals, presumed to be ubiquitous on rocky planets that have/had liquid water
on their surface, 9 have a great affinity to adsorb organics and are known to catalyse chemical
reactions. 10,11 They have been identified on Mars 12 and are expected to have also existed
on early Earth. 9 Due to their extensive surface area and unique properties, clay surfaces are
hypothesized to play a key role in prebiotic chemistry on lifeless worlds, where concentrations
of organics are generally low and non-enzymatic catalytic functions are required. 13 Clay sur2

faces are regarded as a sink for certain protein-forming amino acids (termed ’proteinogenic’),
locally increasing the amino acid concentration through adsorption. These proteinogenic
amino acid-clay interactions have been widely investigated in the context of origins of life. 14
Particularly, the swelling clay montmorillonite (Mt) has chemical and structural properties
that make it a favourable candidate for prebiotic surface chemistry (Figure 1). Using X-Ray
Diffraction (XRD), the structure of Mt has been shown to swell and shrink reversibly under dry and wet conditions, possessing a basal spacing of 9.6 Å when completely dehydrated
and up to 15 − 21 Å when its interlayer is saturated with water. 15 Under wet-dry cycling,
oligomerisation reactions of proteinogenic glycine (adsorbed from 10 mM−1 M aqueous solutions) on Mt surfaces have been demonstrated to become energetically favourable, due to
temporary lowering of the local water activity (the type of surface sites involved in this process is debated). 16 Under different conditions, a preferred heteropeptide oligomerisation in
a system including L-Arginine and L-Glutamic acid adsorbed onto Mt has been reported. 17
Other studies, have demonstrated that Mt is able to catalyse RNA polymerisation, 18 where
certain proteinogenic amino acids act as coenzymes. 19

Non-proteinogenic amino acids, despite their plentiful and universal characters, are less
investigated and are often disregarded for their prebiotic relevance. However, non-proteinogenic
amino acids may indirectly influence processes that contribute to organic complexity. γaminobutyric acid (GABA) is a small-sized (7 − 8 Å) 20 non-proteinogenic amino acid, that
has been found to be present in similar concentrations to that of glycine in carbonaceous
meteorites. 21 Hence the abundance of GABA in prebiotic times in warm pond settings could
have been significant (with respect to other amino acids). GABA has been found to only
weakly adsorb to clay surfaces (physisorption) 22 and therefore has been discarded from origins of life research, as it is deemed a non-viable competitor of proteinogenic amino acids.
Interestingly, however, GABA is known to induce mineralogical modifications in aluminosilicate minerals such as zeolites, that also have exposed siloxane surfaces. 20 Information is
lacking when it comes to understanding how clay properties may be affected by interactions with small monomeric building blocks, and more specifically, by meteorite-common,
non-proteinogenic amino acids such as GABA.
One possible outcome of such organo-clay interactions is a structural change in the clay’s
layered structure, termed exfoliation. In this irreversible process, aluminosilicate layers are
spatially separated from each other. Short peptides (a few monomers long) have been shown
to induce exfoliation in Mt, 23 by being intercalated in the clay’s interlayer spaces and forcing
the aluminosilicate layers apart. Though widely investigated in material sciences, 24 clay
exfoliation induced by interactions with organic building blocks and the associated structure
and surface changes, are yet to be addressed in the field of origins of life.
In this paper, we report a study of the interaction of varying concentrations of nonproteinogenic GABA (100 mM−2 M) with a natural, well characterised calcium Mt clay
(Ca-Mt). ATR-FTIR spectra are given to reveal possible interaction and/or any changes
in chemical bonding in the GABA-exposed Ca-Mt. XRD patterns of clay samples provide
structural information used to inspect the reversibility of observed effects. TEM imaging is
employed to allow for direct observations of the clay structure after exposure to GABA.

Results and discussion
Below the results of the GABA adsorption experiments onto Ca-Mt clay are presented. Measurements of GABA-exposed Ca-Mt samples after washing and drying (’exposed samples’)
and measurements of these samples after rehydration by only water vapour (’rehydrated
samples’) are shown (see Experimental, SI). First, the ATR-FTIR spectra of the samples exposed to different concentrations of GABA are given and discussed. FTIR spectra of GABAexposed samples alongside rehydrated samples in the Si-O stretching region are treated and
presented. Subsequently, powder X-Ray Diffraction (pXRD) measurements of d(001) peaks
for GABA-exposed and rehydrated samples are given, investigating both possible structural
changes in of Ca-Mt after GABA exposure and the reversibility of the clay’s swelling. Finally,
TEM imaging of rehydrated Ca-Mt samples is presented to unravel any physical changes to
the clay’s internal structure.

Transient adsorption of γ-aminobutyric acid
Figure 2 depicts the normalised ATR-FTIR spectra of GABA-exposed Ca-Mt samples (solid
curves, grey to black with increasing GABA concentration), alongside a control sample
(dashed curve). Figure 2a shows the normalised absorbance as a function of frequency for
the full spectral range gathered (450 − 4000 cm−1 ). There are three regions of interest; I.
fingerprint region of organics and OH bending modes 1300 − 1700 cm−1 (Figure 2b), II. OH
(and NH) stretching region 3000 − 3700 cm−1 (Figure 2c), III. Ca-Mt clay absorbance region
450 − 1250 cm−1 (Figure 2d). We focus on regions I and II to examine the extent of GABA
adsorption and water content-related changes, and on region III to scrutinize changes in the
chemical bonds of the mineral as a function of initial GABA concentration.
The intense peak at 1640 cm−1 in region I (Figure 2b) is the OH bending mode of adsorbed
water. 25 Most, but not all water is lost after dehydration of the GABA-exposed samples.
Interestingly, the OH bending intensity decreases with increasing GABA concentration, in-

dicating less water is retained in the dehydrated clay after it was exposed to GABA. This
is most apparent after exposure with 2 M GABA concentration. The weak spectral feature
centered at 1425 cm−1 originates from the mineral sample itself, as also observed in the control sample. There is no indication of GABA itself being absorbed. Any GABA fingerprints
would be expected around 1579, 1398 and 1309 cm−1 . 26
In region II (Figure 2c), two main spectral features related to OH stretching can be found;
a broad feature around 3400 cm−1 attributed to adsorbed water molecules and narrower a
band at 3620 cm−1 related to OH stretching of OH groups within the clay’s structure. 25
Similar to the OH bending band of the clay in region I, the 3400 cm−1 band also decreases
with exposure to increasing GABA concentrations, confirming the clay drying more easily
after increased exposure (Figure 2c). Also similar to region I, there are no features pointing
to any GABA absorption. Although the 3410 cm−1 fingerprint of GABA could possibly be
obscured by the dominating OH bands, there is also no indication of any GABA absorption
around 3028 cm−1 . 26 GABA molecules (predominantly in the zwitterionic state at these
experimental conditions 27 ) are expected to interact via electrostatic interaction with the
negatively-charged siloxane surfaces of Ca-Mt. The absence of any GABA bands in the
exposed samples demonstrates that GABA does not remain adsorbed to the surfaces of
Ca-Mt after washing (see SI for ATR-FTIR spectra of water washes of GABA-exposed CaMt), even at the highest concentration examined. This finding is consistent with the known
weak-adsorption behaviour (physisorption) of GABA on clay surfaces. 22
Although GABA does not remain at the mineral surface after washing, major changes
are observed in IR bands related to the mineral in region III (Figure 2d). Here, there
are multiple bands associated with the clay’s atomic structure, particularly, Si-O stretching
(950 − 1150 cm−1 ) and bending (450 − 550 cm−1 ) modes, and OH bending modes connected
to different cations within the clay’s structure such as Al, Mg and Fe. 25,28 Moreover, there
are two bands associated with cristobalite, one of the silica polymorphs that constitute about
25% of the natural clay material used in this study. 25 The most marked change in the ATR-

FTIR spectral region III (Figure 2d), is in the shape of the broad envelope created by the
overlapping Si-O stretching bands. Here an increasing shift in the maximum of the envelope
to higher wavenumbers is observed as a function of increasing initial GABA concentration.
Other bands of Ca-Mt are also observed to change in response to GABA exposure, with the
changes being most prominent with maximum GABA exposure. The bending vibration of
Si-O-Si at 460 cm−1 , associated with the silica tetrahedral layers, increases in intensity with
increasing GABA concentration. Intensities of the Al-OH-Al bending at 916 cm−1 , the AlOH-Fe bending at 886 cm−1 , and the Al-OH-Mg and Fe-OH-Fe bending at 844 cm−1 decrease
with increasing GABA-concentration exposure. Changes in Si-O stretching and bending
bands are closely related to the structural state of the clay’s aluminosilicate network 29 and
can reflect a structural alteration of Ca-Mt (Figure 1). The dependency of the alterations
on the GABA concentration and these alterations persisting even though no lasting GABA
adsorption is observed, point to a transient GABA-Mt interaction.

Local structure changes in Ca-montmorillonite layers
The nature of the structural changes can be further investigated by looking more closely
to the behaviour of the Si-O stretching band envelope at 950 − 1150 cm−1 . A peak-finding
procedure was applied to the Si-O stretching region to find and fit the individual vibrational
mode contributions and plot their positions as function of initial GABA concentration (see
Experimental). The modes of both exposed (black) and rehydrated (blue) Ca-Mt samples
were analysed. Figure 3 shows the ascertained band frequencies of two Si-O-Al (out-ofplane and in-plane) modes and two Si-O-Si (in-plane) modes as function of initial GABA
concentration. The out-of-plane Si-O-Al band position around 1098 cm−1 is displayed in
Figure 3a. In the case of the GABA-exposed Ca-Mt samples (black), its position is red
shifted by approx. 14 cm−1 for high GABA concentrations with respect the control sample.
On the contrary, its in-plane counterpart does not change, even for the highest GABA
concentration (Figure 3b). The positions of the in-plane Si-O-Si bands are not (Figure 3c)

or only slightly affected (Figure 3d). The change in the out-of-plane Si-O-Al mode, whilst
its in-plane counterpart remains unaffected, points to a change in the [001] direction (Figure
1) and suggests a structural alteration of Ca-Mt 30 induced by the interaction with GABA.

Figure 3: Si-O stretching vibration frequencies of Ca-Mt as a function of initial GABA
concentration for dehydrated GABA-exposed samples (black) and rehydrated samples (blue).
Si-O-Al stretching modes around (a) 1100 cm−1 : out-of-plane, (b) 1040 cm−1 : in-plane. SiO-Si stretching modes around (c) 1070 cm−1 : in-plane (higher-frequency), (d) 1000 cm−1 :
in-plane (lower-frequency). See Figure 1 for an illustration of these Si-O stretching modes
in Ca-Mt structure. All y-axes have a range of 42 cm−1 .

Introducing water molecules back into the altered Ca-Mt effectively masks the frequency
shift in the perpendicular direction that is observed for the exposed samples (Figure 3a,
blue line). Notably, the small shift in the Si-O-Si stretching lower-frequency mode of the
dried, exposed sample becomes accentuated upon re-adsorption of water (Figure 3d). The
shift of the mode is correlated with GABA concentration and cannot be due to differing
water uptake, as the water weight gain is controlled to be similar for all samples in the
rehydration step (see SI). Thus, even after rehydration, the change that GABA induces in

the structure of Ca-Mt is retained. The Si-O-Si in-plane stretching modes are internal modes
occurring within the tetrahedral sheets (Figure 1). Any disruption induced by either water
or GABA is expected to affect these bands. As only the lower-frequency Si-O-Si stretching
band seems to be affected by exposure to GABA, this confirms that the Si-O-Si network
is being disrupted, but only locally and not significantly enough to disrupt both Si-O-Si
vibrational modes (Figures 3c, d). In summary, the GABA-altered Ca-Mt samples maintain
their structural alteration upon rehydration, thus pointing towards an irreversible process
that has taken place. These irreversible effects should be observable in other behaviours
that depend on interactions of the clay’s siloxane surfaces, such as in the reversibility of the
swelling behaviour of Ca-Mt.

Irreversible alteration of Ca-montmorillonite layered structure
Complementary to ATR-FTIR data, XRD data of Ca-Mt provides long-range structural
information for both the [001] direction that is perpendicular to the clay layers and the periodicity of the structure in other lattice directions. The clay’s response to water adsorption
and its reversible swelling capacity is hereby examined for GABA-altered samples. Figure 4a
presents the normalised XRD d(001) peak of GABA-exposed samples, for 2 M GABA-altered
Ca-Mt samples (black) and control Ca-Mt samples (unexposed to GABA, grey dot-dashed).
For full pXRD patterns acquired see SI. The d(001) peak of the control sample is asymmetric,
wide and of relatively low intensity (Figure 4a). The behaviour of the control sample is consistent with the literature documented behaviour of Ca-Mt upon dehydration. 15 Dehydration
of Ca-Mt results in intensity loss and shape change (flattening and asymmetric widening)
of the XRD d(001) peak due to water loss from the interlayer spaces and their consequent
collapse. After GABA exposure, a change in the pattern of the d(001) peak is observed. The
2 M GABA-altered Ca-Mt sample exhibits an even more diminished peak compared to that
of the control sample. Lack of a peak shift or increase in intensity with respect to the control
sample, reiterates that GABA did not remain within the clay’s interlayer spaces. 31 In other

words, the absence of the Ca-Mt d(001) peak, confirms that GABA is not intercalated in
the interlayer spaces of Ca-Mt after washing and points to only transient adsorption. This
is consistent with ATR-FTIR findings that show no signs of GABA adsorption onto Ca-Mt
basal surfaces after the washes (Figures 2b, c). Moreover, further weakening of the already
weak XRD d(001) peak after exposure to 2 M GABA concentration, reiterates the lower
retention of water in comparison to the control sample. This is consistent with ATR-FTIR
findings that show a decreased intensity of adsorbed water band around 3400 cm−1 (Figure
2c). In short, water is more effectively lost from the 2 M GABA-altered sample, resulting
in the lower intensity of the water FTIR bands and d(001) peaks compared to the control
sample.
Figure 4b shows the normalised XRD d(001) peak of 2 M GABA-altered Ca-Mt samples
(black) and control Ca-Mt samples (unexposed to GABA, grey dot-dashed) after rehydration.
As expected, re-adsorption of water in the Ca-Mt control sample results in the reappearance
of the d(001) peak, demonstrating the clay’s reversible swelling behaviour. 15 Intriguingly,
this is not the case for the 2 M GABA-altered Ca-Mt. This sample does not recover its
d(001) peak to the same intensity as the control sample. To assess this effect, the area
of the d(001) peaks and the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) as a function of initial
GABA concentration are examined for the rehydrated samples and presented in Figures 4c,
d, respectively. While the area of the d(001) peak significantly decreases, the FWHM of the
peak does not change as a function of the initial concentration (even though the standard
deviation increases). As the intensity of the d(001) peak in the 2 M GABA-altered sample is
not restored to control sample levels, our results indicate that the GABA-induced structural
change of Ca-Mt suppresses its reversible swelling capacity. No significant changes in other
lattice directions are observed, including the [100] direction (see SI). Concomitantly, the
results suggest that the long-range crystal periodicity in the [001] direction is not completely
destroyed, as the d(001) peak is partially regained, even after the GABA-induced alteration.
Given the FTIR results that show a shift of internal vibrational modes and reflect local

changes in the Ca-Mt mineral, both techniques together suggest that the changes induced
by GABA are very local in the (001) surfaces, but that these can have a large effect on the
material properties of Ca-Mt.
Reduction in the intensity recovery of the d(001) peak in the pXRD upon rehydration
of GABA-exposed Ca-Mt (Figure 4c) could be related to (partial) exfoliation of the clay. 32
Another, independent indication for clay exfoliation, arises from the FTIR analysis that
reveals shifts of the out-of-plane Si-O-Al vibrational mode (Figure 3a) associated with this
particular structural alteration. 30 Clay exfoliation is further associated with an enlargement
of outer-surface area at the expense of interlayer surfaces. 29 We observe signs for this effect, as water loss upon dehydration is easier in the GABA-exposed clay compared to the
control sample, according to FTIR spectra and XRD data. Exfoliation has been observed
with a range of clay materials and organic molecules, 24 including some few monomers-long
peptides. 23 However, in this work we observe exfoliation after merely a transient adsorption
of a small-sized organic molecule, namely in the presence of GABA in water without preceding chemical treatment. Previous works report that exfoliation is also associated with
increasing XRD d(001) values, originating from the retention of large organic compounds
within the clay structure, and increase in FWHMs of the XRD peaks due to micro-stresses 23
or formation of particles smaller than 50 nm. 33 Here, however, we observe a different behaviour, suggesting a different exfoliation mechanism is in play. Short carbon-chain amino
acids (up to 8-carbons, 24 mM) with a terminal amino group are thought to lie flat within
the interlayer space, 34 limiting their ability to cause exfoliation. Still, our pXRD results
and FTIR analysis strongly point to (partial) exfoliation of Ca-Mt occurring, induced by
transient interaction with GABA. Therefore, we present below Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging to directly observe and characterise the exfoliation in the Ca-Mt
samples after alteration through interaction with GABA molecules.

Partial exfoliation and nanoscale cavity formation
Figure 5 presents TEM images of the rehydrated samples. Figure 5a shows an image of the
Ca-Mt control sample, which exhibits features of ordered 2:1 aluminosilicate layers visible
as equally spaced dark lines, alongside material with a cloudy and/or granular appearance.
This image is an example of a grain with nicely ordered layering. Some images of the
control sample exhibit slightly distorted layering (see SI). Figure 5b presents a 2 M GABAaltered Ca-Mt sample (with equal water weight gain upon rehydration, see SI). Remarkably,
multiple nanoscale cavities can be observed. These are found in between adjacent (distorted)
aluminosilicate layers. The cavities are estimated to form in a significant percentage of the
grains, up to 25%, after the GABA exposure (see SI). No cavities are found in the control CaMt sample. The nanoscale cavities are always accompanied by distorted layering, which also
appears more often after exposure (see SI). The cavities have an average size of 3.08±1.66 nm
in the [001] direction, with the smallest and largest cavity possessing a respective size of
1.35 ± 0.20 nm and 6.30 ± 0.31 nm. Surprisingly, these nanoscale cavities are observed to
occur mid-layer, predominantly embedded within the interior of the sheet structure, and not
restricted to the edges where the sheets terminate.
TEM imaging not only confirms GABA-induced (partial) exfoliation is taking place,
but goes beyond it to show that in this process, local nanoscale cavities are formed midlayer within the distorted aluminosilicate layered structures. The direct observation of these
nanocavities confirms the ATR-FTIR and pXRD results presented in this study, which indicate localised, irreversible structural changes occur. Note that no absorbance peak is
observed at 3691 cm−1 (Figure 2c), which is characteristic of the 1:1 clay kaolinite. 28 This
suggests that the 2:1 aluminosilicate layers remain intact in the exfoliation/cavity formation
process. Yet, due to the exfoliation, there is a loss of coherency of the layered structure of
Ca-Mt, predominant in the direction perpendicular to the layers (the [001] direction). This is
physically manifested by the formation of local nanoscale cavities, visible by TEM imaging.

Figure 5: TEM images of rehydrated Ca-Mt (water weight gain 18%): (a) control sample,
where white arrows mark well-ordered aluminosilicate layers and (b) 2 M GABA-altered
sample, where black arrows indicate a couple of the nanoscale cavities between adjacent
aluminosilicate layers.

The (partial) exfoliation seems to originate from the transient interaction character of
GABA with Ca-Mt. This character can also allow for GABA recycling, which might explain the localised, interior appearance of the cavities. A single GABA molecule can then
repeatedly damage the clay structure at the same area and do so for a longer time when it
is located mid-layer. The recycling would lead to a local self-amplification effect, bringing
about the partial exfoliation. Even at GABA concentrations lower than 2 M, for example at
400 mM, the effects are already observable in the FTIR spectra (Figures 2d, 3d) and XRD
data (Figure 4c), for a contact time as short as two-hours. Therefore, a striking possibility
is that even when considering the low organic concentrations expected in prebiotic environments (presumably only up to few mM), this self-amplified alteration effect on the clay’s
structure observed in this study can possibly not be neglected.
The formation of nanoscale cavities within the Ca-Mt clay can have far-reaching impact.
The physicochemical conditions in these (semi-)confined cavities could dramatically differ
from the external conditions. For example, binding of water within the interlayer space of a

the presence of supercooled water. This effect was observed in Mt, 35 and in other clays such
as halloysite 36 and vermiculite. 37 While in these studies, 2D confinement of water was investigated, computational work has shown that nano-pores can hold bound, unfreezable water
up to a pore size of 2.3 ± 0.1 nm. 38 It is not experimentally known how dissolved/adsorbed
organics influence this behaviour, but these nano-scaled cavities with bound water activity
could promote polymerisation reactions as lowered water activity is a requirement. 16 The
nano-scaled pores also allow for localised organic concentrations, pH (also influenced by the
presence of organics), and other parameters that are different from the outside conditions.
This positions the nanoscale cavities in a non-equilibrium state with respect to the external
environment, a required starting point for many life-relevant processes.
Our results shed new light on processes that organo-clay interactions with exogenous
organic species can induce. GABA is a non-proteinogenic, predominantly meteoric species.
It is not expected to undergo polymerisation, yet our results reveal the importance of incorporating such organic species in origins-of-life research and the possible importance of
exogenous delivery. This work illustrates that an exogenous species can significantly change
the physicochemical nature of the surface clay. The transient GABA-induced interaction
irreversibly alters the Mt swelling clay, resulting in the formation of nanoscale cavities and a
suppressed swelling capacity, paving the way to more complex surface-catalysed chemistry.

Conclusion and Outlook
This work provides fundamental insights into processes that may play a key role in prebiotic warm rock pool environments, exemplifying that structural changes in clay be can
induced by interactions between small organics and these minerals. GABA, a meteoric, nonproteinogenic amino acid, is experimentally found to act as an exfoliating agent of Ca-Mt
upon its transient adsorption under prebiotically-relevant temperatures and mild conditions.
The nature of the GABA-Mt interaction is transient, yet the alteration of Ca-Mt is irreversible. GABA induces (partial) exfoliation, leading to the formation of local, nanoscale
cavities between adjacent aluminosilicate layers. This causes loss of layer coherency and
suppression of the reversible swelling capacity of the clay. The local, non-edge defects influence the properties of the material predominantly in the direction perpendicular to the
clay layers and can be detected by analysing the IR signatures of the dehydrated clay. The
localised character and interior placement of the partial exfoliation points to an amplification
effect with the GABA being recycled (repeatedly adsorbed and desorbed) before being lost.
These further suggest that the GABA-induced exfoliation behaviour of Ca-Mt is inherently
different compared to other, well-investigated, clay exfoliation mechanisms. The formation
of nanoscale cavities could be of major importance to origin-of-life research, and might have
indirect implications on proteinogenesis on rocky (exo)planets. The emergent nanoscale
cavities are (semi-)confined nano-environments inside the clay’s layered structure, in which
conditions may differ significantly compared to the external environment (e.g. change in
water activity, pH, increased organic concentrations). Further research is needed in order
to elucidate the mechanism governing the exfoliation process and to investigate the possible
importance to the origins of life on rocky planets.

Experimental
Calcium montmorillonite STx-1b (Ca-Mt) source clay was purchased from the Clay Mineral
Society, USA. The chemical formula of STx-1b is
(Si7 .753 Al0.247 )(Al3.281 M g0.558 F e0.136 T i0.024 M n0.002 )(Ca0.341 N a0.039 K0.061 )O20 (OH)4
and the cation exchange capacity value is 66.1 ± 2.1 100meq/100gr. 25 The fine clay fraction
with a diameter ≤ 2 µm was separated by sedimentation in ultrapure Milli-Q water (18.2
MΩ*cm @25◦ C, 1.5ppb TOC), where the settling velocity was calculated according to Stokes
law. After sedimentation, the clay was dried in an oven at 180◦ C in air for at least one week.
The sedimentation procedure was confirmed successful using SEM imaging. This fine clay
fraction was then used throughout the experiments. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (≥ 99%)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

Experimental procedure
Ca-Mt-GABA suspensions were prepared in the following fashion: GABA solutions of concentrations 100 mM, 400 mM, 700 mM, 1 M and 2 M in Milli-Q water were added to Ca-Mt
in the ratio of 3 mL solution per 100 mg clay. The pH of the GABA solutions was not adjusted. pH was measured at room temperature using a Mettler-Toledo pH probe calibrated
with standard solutions (see SI). The control experiments with Ca-Mt water suspension were
conducted with Milli-Q water, thus did not contain any GABA. All suspensions were stirred
at a rate of 650 rpm whilst retained at 80◦ C for two hours (’suspension-adsorption’ step)
in 10 mL glass vials that were loosely covered with pierced aluminium foil to prevent water
evaporation. The suspensions were then separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was collected. The remaining solid clay samples were washed twice
by re-suspending the solids in about 5 mL of Milli-Q water, followed by shaking at 1000 rpm
for 15 minutes, after which the samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes, enabling
the collection of the washed supernatants (see SI). The twice-washed solid clay samples

were dehydrated at 120◦ C in an oven with the fan function on (i.e. under flowing air) for
163 hours and 40 minutes (samples that have undergone this treatment are referred to as
’exposed samples’). Three separate experimental repetitions of the suspension-adsorption
procedure followed by washes and dehydration, as described above, were performed on different occasions. For two of these repetitions, that took place at two consecutive days, the
same GABA 2 M stock solution was used. The third repetition, that took place at a later
occasion, required the preparation of a new stock solution.
Rehydration procedure: Dehydrated solid samples of control and GABA-exposed Ca-Mt
were rehydrated by humidification with water vapour generated from MilliQ water in a sealed
box until a weight gain of about 15-30% was measured (so called ’rehydrated samples’). Two
rehydration sets were performed, using GABA-exposed and control Ca-Mt samples from two
respective experimental repetitions. The humidification time was 24 hours for the first set
and 6 hours for the second set. For each rehydrated clay sample, the ratio of weight of
adsorbed water to weight of dehydrated clay (’adsorbed water weight gain’) was calculated.

Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy
ATR-FTIR measurements were carried out using a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrometer ”Frontier” with a ”GladiATR” mount (Pike technologies). The ATR mount was connected to a nitrogen/air flow in over-pressure starting at least 30 min before measuring. The measurements
of solid samples were carried out with a resolution of 2 cm−1 (data interval 0.5 cm−1 ), and
were a composite of 64 scans that were accumulated over a spectral range of 450 − 4000 cm−1
at room temperature. A background scan was collected before each solid sample measurement. The measurements of liquid samples were carried out using the same resolution, but
by accumulating 8 scans in the spectral range of 450 − 4000 cm−1 at room temperature. A
background scan was collected after every 4 − 5 liquid samples.
Baseline subtraction was carried out by first identifying the baseline using a linear fit of

spectral ranges in which no absorbance bands were expected nor observed, namely between
2400 − 2800 cm−1 and 3800 − 4000 cm−1 . The linear fit was then subtracted from the entire
spectrum. Peak position determination was performed using second derivative analysis. 39 To
obtain a usable second derivative plot it was necessary to smooth the data within our regions
of interest, a common practise for this type of analysis. 40 The data was smoothed using a
second order Savitsky-Golay filter 41 with a 31-point window. This allowed us to calculate
the first derivative curve, which was also smoothed in the same manner, to determine the
second derivative plot of each spectrum. The points that define a minimum in this plot correspond to absorbance-band positions and were identified using a Matlab script. The peak
finding procedure was applied to the (greater range of the) Si-O stretching band envelope at
885 − 1285 cm−1 and to the range of 450 − 660 cm−1 , that includes the Si-O-Al bending mode
at 519 cm−1 selected for normalisation. The 519 cm−1 mode was selected as it represents
the in-plane vibrational mode furthest from the interlayer space, that is assumed to be least
affected by interactions of the basal siloxane surfaces. For intensity-normalisation to this
mode, a fitting procedure employed Gaussian functions at the derived band positions (including position uncertainty of ±4 cm−1 for dehydrated samples and ±6 cm−1 for rehydrated
samples) in the range of 450 − 660 cm−1 with band widths of 26 ± 4 cm−1 . The final spectra
are averaged spectra of available experimental repetitions with the standard deviation as
function of frequency displayed as highlighted margins around the averaged curves. 42

Powder X-Ray Diffraction
pXRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku MiniFlex II diffractometer with a Nifiltered Cu Kα source (λ=1.540562 Å) operated at voltage of 30 kV and current of 15 mA.
For X-ray detection, a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector with a Be window of diameter ϕ23 mm
and length of 80 mm was used. A single-crystal silicon low background sample holder with a
0.2 mm deep and 8 mm diameter cavity was used. Powder samples were ground then pressed
into the cavity in the sample holder to create a flat and uniform surface, excess material

was removed. All measurements were carried out in the range of 3 − 40(◦ 2θ). In the ranges
of 3 − 10(◦ 2θ) and 34 − 40(◦ 2θ), measurements were carried out in 0.01◦ resolution with
scanning rate of 0.5◦ /min. In the range of 10 − 34(◦ 2θ) they were carried out typically in
0.05◦ resolution and rate of 2.5◦ /min, and for a few samples in resolution of 0.01◦ and rate
of 0.5◦ /min.
Background measurements that were gathered on the same day as the sample measurements
were smoothed using a 21-point moving average and subtracted from each diffractogram.
Diffraction data obtained with a resolution of 0.01◦ were binned to 0.05◦ resolution to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio. The diffractograms were area normalised to the Ca-Mt d(105) peak
in the range of 34 − 39.5(◦ 2θ) of one of the control samples. Normalisation was conducted
separately for the GABA-exposed and rehydrated clay data sets. The Mt d(105) peak was
chosen for normalisation in all cases, as it did not change shape and position for different
samples. The final diffractograms are averaged diffractograms of available experimental
repetitions with the standard deviation as function of ◦ 2θ value displayed as highlighted
margins around the averaged curves. 42 The d(001) diffraction peaks of Ca-Mt were fitted to
Lorentzian functions 43 of the form y = P1 /((x − P2 )2 + P3 ) + C in the range of 4 − 8 (◦ 2θ).
The FWHM of each Ca-Mt d(001) peak was derived using the fit parameter P3 according to
p
F W HM = 4P3 (1 + s) (following equation 21 in ref 44 ), where s is the asymmetry factor,
chosen have a value of 0.5 for all peaks. The area of each Ca-Mt d(001) peak was obtained
by integrating over the fitted Lorentzian function.

Electron Microscopy
TEM imaging was performed using a Thermo Fischer TFS Talos F200X S(TEM) instrument,
at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Rehydrated Ca-Mt samples (control and GABA 2 Minteracted) with 18% weight gain due to water adsorption were examined. Image analysis was
performed using ImageJ program. We analysed 29 images of the 2 M GABA-altered sample
and 16 images of the control sample (see SI). To determine average basal spacing for each

sample, we analysed images exhibiting both well-ordered and distorted layered structures,
excluding cavities. To quantify the occurrences where well-ordered vs. distorted 2:1 layered
structures appeared, we manually selected and categorised all the available TEM images
where at least 4-5 adjacent layers were clearly visible (not including image multiplicity). For
ordered/distorted categorisation, in cases where a distorted layered structure was observed
the image was counted as ’distorted’ even if an ordered structure was present at another part
of that image (i.e. not counting a single image twice). This was performed for both control
and 2 M GABA-altered rehydrated samples. Cavity size determination was performed by
measuring the cavity size in the [001] direction ten times for the same cavity and calculating
the average and standard deviation. A total number of ten cavities were analysed, observed
in seven different images.
