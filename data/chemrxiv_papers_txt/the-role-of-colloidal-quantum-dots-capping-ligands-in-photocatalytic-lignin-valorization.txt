Abstract
The efficient transformation of biomass into high-value chemicals remains a significant
challenge, with surface ligand manipulation offering a promising approach to enhance
catalytic performance. In this study, we investigate the role of organic ligands in the
photocatalytic conversion of lignin into functionalized aromatics using cadmium sulfide
(CdS) quantum dots (QDs). By tuning the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of ligands, we
successfully form stable QD colloidal solutions, ensuring effective contact between the QDs
and lignin. We determined that thiyl ligands triggered the photocatalytic conversion of lignin
models. These ligand modifications, including the anchor group and alkyl chain length, are
shown to play a critical role in facilitating electron transfer during photocatalysis.
Furthermore, it was discovered that the mechanism of C-C and C-O bond cleavage at the
Œ≤-O-4 linkages can be influenced by the substituents on the aromatic rings of lignin, a finding
that has not been previously reported. Our findings not only advance the understanding of
ligand-controlled catalysis but also present a new pathway for efficient lignin biomass
valorization and organic transformation processes using QD-based photocatalysts.

Introduction
Disrupting the strong reliance on petrochemical compound industry and guarantee
sustainable development could only be achieved by establishing a biorefinery model
capable of exploiting a complete valorization of lignocellulosic biomass, the largest
renewable source of carbon, which is composed of a carbohydrate fraction (cellulose and
hemicellulose, up to 70 wt%) and an aromatic-rich polymer fraction (lignin, up to 30 wt%).
Both fractions must be valorized, unfortunately, up to now, only the carbohydrate fraction is
efficiently repurposed in lignocellulosic biorefineries,1,2 through pulp manufacturing, whereas
a substantial byproduct stream of lignin (technical lignin) is released as a waste, or burnt as
low energy fuel, despite being a source of highly desirable aromatic compounds. 3,4

However, given its distinctive aromatic structure, widespread availability, and low-cost lignin
valorization has the potential to serve as a primary alternative to petroleum for producing
high-value aromatic compounds. Lignin is made up of three main sub-units p-hydroxyphenyl
(H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) crosslinked by C-C and C-O linkages. 5,6 Among them, the
Œ≤-O-4 ether linkage is the core target of lignin valorization because it is the most abundant
and weakest bond, compared to bonds like Œ≤-Œ≤ resinol and 5-5‚Äô biphenyl which are more
resistant and present greater challenges.7 However, the Œ≤-O-4 availability could be strongly
decreased by lignin extraction process, while affecting the depolymerization. Some
strategies have employed the lignin-first concept, which basically consists of avoiding lignin
extraction processes and cleaving the maximum theoretical Œ≤-O-4 linkages, directly from
milled wood. Unfortunately, the complex mixture of carbohydrate and aromatic products
without a trend selectivity makes lignin-first difficult to be exploited. Whereas the organosolv
technique remains the most effective technique for maintaining Œ≤-O-4 bonds and producing
clean and faster depolymerization. 2,3
Controlled and efficient depolymerization of lignocellulose biomass continues being one of
the most difficult challenges, current technologies continue employing thermal and chemical
catalytic methods, which is not effective due to the high cost and because there is no control
on the depolymerization.8,9 Different approaches have been tested to enhance aromatic
monomer production, among them, the ‚Äúnatural way‚Äù based on microbial engineering has
gained attention for its high selectivity through the specific contact between the lignin bond
ligands and the biocatalyst, often composed by enzymes or microorganisms. The
performance of this technique is based on boosting the ligand interaction between ligands
and the catalytic active center. Unfortunately, it represents cost-effectiveness, poor efficiency
and a high-energy-demand technique, however, it represents a good example of ligand
triggering depolymerization of lignin. 2,3
On the other hand, lignin depolymerization via photocatalysis has gained attention for its
sustainability and ability to control the depolymerization through regulating different
properties on nanomaterial semiconductors such as bandgap, optimal band-edge position,
surface area, morphology, etc.10‚Äì13 In addition, it offers advantages such as lower energy
requirements, minimal by-products, scalability, and environmental benefits.14‚Äì17 Although
there are some studies using photocatalytic routes for lignin depolymerization, there is a
lack of interest in determining the effect of nanomaterial ligands and their contribution to
depolymerization. This is mainly, since organic ligands on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces,
which regulate nucleation and growth kinetics during nanocrystal synthesis, have historically
been regarded as deleterious to catalytic efficiency, therefore these organic capping agents
are often eliminated through post-synthetic treatments.18‚Äì20 However, some studies have
revealed that surface ligands can significantly enhance the performance of nanocatalysts,
by acting as mediators and challenging this traditional perspective.21
Some researchers have demonstrated that the efficiency of quantum dots (QDs)
photocatalysts with organic ligands could enhance the depolymerization based only on the
length of ligand and the steric hindrance.7,22‚Äì28 However, research on the role of ligands in
photocatalysis for larger molecules remains limited. In this study, CdS quantum dots with
various surface ligands are systematically examined for photocatalytic depolymerization of
lignin. First, simple lignin models such as benzyl alcohol (BA), and 2-phenoxy-1phenylethanol (Ppol) were tested to test the catalytic oxidation and the two-step oxidation-

reduction routes. Then a series of dimer lignin models was studied to check the influence of
electron-donating groups in the substrate. We demonstrate that catalytic performance is
highly influenced by the structure of organic ligands and reveal the mechanism involved by
which surface ligands regulate the photocatalytic conversion of lignin. To the best of our
knowledge, it represents the first report that demonstrates the activity and selectivity given
by ligands agent on nanomaterials photocatalyst, furthermore, By taking advantage of light
as a renewable energy source, photocatalysis supports sustainable and circular bioeconomy
initiatives to depolymerize lignin into valuable chemicals and monomers.

Results and discussion
CdS quantum dots were synthesized using the conventional hot injection technique with
minor changes.29 Subsequent surface modification and the procedure to obtain all the
photocatalyst are provided in the Supporting Information (Table S1). IR spectra (figure S1)
allowed to verify the presence of organic bands such as the ùõé O-H and ùõé C=O stretching
band characteristic of carboxylic acids, as well as the loss of ùõé C-H stretching characteristic
of CdS/OA. The UV/vis technique (figure S2) corroborated that the first excitonic peak of
nanocrystals is not affected by ligand exchange. However, a short red-shift was evidenced
in the CdS/BF4 which was attributed to aggregation effects. While TEM images (Figure S3)
allowed to verify the presence of nanocrystals of about 3.1 nm for most of the nanocatalysts
except for CdS/BF4, whose diameter was 3.2 nm. However, comparing with the When
calculating the particle size using the Peng equation, it was found to be approximately 4.3
nm.30 This discrepancy in size can be attributed to the fact that solvents in UV/vis
spectroscopy can influence the hydrodynamic radius of the particle, thereby leading to an
increase in the actual size of the quantum dot. The 1H NMR technique was used to confirm
the presence and attachment of ligands to the surface. Figure S4 demonstrates a distinct
shift in the chemical shift of the C-H signal when the ligand is free compared to when it is
attached. As an example, for the MPA molecule alone, the two protons from the methylene
groups showed a resonance multiplet signal at about 2.63 ppm according with previous
reports.31,32 The formation of the Cd‚ÄìMPA complex in ligand exchange clearly involves the
deprotonation of the thiol group. Compared to the free molecule, the chemical shift and
broadening of the two resonance signals indicate the formation of the Cd‚ÄìMPA complex.
The same behavior was observed with the rest of ligands.33‚Äì36 Based on this study, it was
estimated the density of ligands on CdS quantum dots. In a standard case using CdS-OA at
a concentration of 10 mg/mL, the OA concentration was determined by integrating the
alkene resonance in the 1H NMR spectrum employing 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene as
internal standard. This afforded an average 3,62 OA/nm2 (based on the 4,2 nm of diameter
determined by Peng equation). Similarly, the ligand density of mercaptoalkanoic acid ligands
was determined using dimethyl sulfone as internal standard (figure S5) and the alkyl
hydrogen integration was employed to calculate the density of the associated ligands.37,38
Apparently, the CdS/MBA presented the higher ligand density with 7,98 MBA/nm2 which
could be produced by œÄ-œÄ stacking. So, the conjugated ligand 4-mercaptobenzoic acid
(MBA) could introduce fewer trap states and exhibit a similar charge transfer rate in QD
ensembles, but could affect the photocatalytic performance.39,40
Photocatalytic conditions are presented in the Supporting Information. Figure 1 shows the
photocatalytic response of the QDs covered with different ligands. First, benzyl alcohol and

2-phenoxyphenylethanol were tested as lignin models compounds to check the ability of
photocatalyst to depolymerize lignin. Benzyl alcohol, which has a hydroxyl group in CŒ± next
to aromatic ring, was subjected to oxidation, being quantitatively transformed to
benzaldehyde by employing L-Cys, MPA or ME as ligands. A similar behavior was observed
when 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol, which presents the Œ≤-O-4 bond, the target linkage
mimicking those present in lignin‚Äôs structure was employed as substrate, yielding phenol
(PhOH) and acetophenone (APO) as major products (scheme S1 and S2 are presented in
the Supporting Information, showing the structures of subproducts and conditions of
photocatalytic reactions).

Different researchers have studied the photo-depolymerization of lignin based on the
scission of C-C or C-O involved in the Œ≤-O-4 linkage. All of them emphasize that
photoinduced holes will attack the CŒ±-H of the Œ≤-O-4 bond of lignin to form CŒ± radical first
this process is known as ‚Äúoxidative dehydrogenation‚Äù. Although, some of them consider that
the hydroxyl group at the CŒ± position (CŒ±-OH) will be dehydrogenated into the carbonyl group
(CŒ±=O) reducing the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the adjacent CŒ≤-O bond from 69.2

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-db58r ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4914-2918 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

to 55.9 kcal/mol, which makes the subsequent CŒ≤-O bond cleavage much easier, following
photocatalytic reduction ensues, but employing two step strategy.41,42 Recently, it has been
reported that after CŒ± radical formation, electrons can directly or indirectly combine with
generated CŒ± radicals to facilitate the C-O or C-C bonds cleavage.43 Using this approach,
only it is necessary to perform a one-step photoreaction, avoiding separate and purify the
generated intermediate ketones, which simplifies the whole reaction.44 This mechanism was
initially observed by Wang et al. using CdS QDs as a photocatalyst.45 In their experiments
with model compounds (2-phenoxy-1-phenyl-ethanol and 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanone),
they discovered that the photocatalytic conversion of a ketone intermediate was notably slow
with CdS QDs, suggesting the involvement of an alternative pathway, likely a radical
mechanism. DFT calculations showed that generating a CŒ± radical through interaction with
a photogenerated hole significantly reduced the C‚ÄìO bond dissociation energy (BDE) from
55 to 7.8 kcal/mol, a much greater effect compared to oxidizing CŒ±‚ÄìOH to CŒ±=O.
Similarly, this hypothesis was corroborated in this study by the photocatalytic conversion of
the lignin models. First, the CdS/OA (solubilized in n-hexane) were tested to oxidize BA,
without effective conversion (lower than 5%), indicating a lack of efficiency between the
interaction of photogenerated charges and the substrate. These findings clearly
demonstrate that adjusting the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of ligands in polar or
nonpolar solvents to form a QD colloidal solution is crucial for the photocatalytic conversion
of lignin models and solid native lignin. The ligand exchange allowed to obtain photocatalyst
with mercapto-carboxylic groups which allowed the solubilization of the QDs in polar
solvents. The photocatalytic reaction of BA and Ppol, was carried out in a mixture of
CH3CN/H2O (Supporting information contains details), it was observed that ratio of organic
solvent could affect the selectivity of products. Furthermore, the figures 1a and 1b, present
the conversion, yield product and selectivity of photoconversion of BA, whereas Figures 1c
and 1d show the same behavior but employing Ppol as substrate. Note that in both cases
same trend was obtained where the ligands MBA, MUA and BF4 had the worse conversion.
This inefficient performance is closely related to the limitation of photogenerated charges to
reach the surface, specifically with mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which has a long
aliphatic chain (CH2)10. On the other hand, MBA could stabilize the photogenerated charges
due to its conjugated structures that exhibit increased stability due to the delocalization of
electrons within œÄ bonds, stabilizing the photogenerated charges by resonance. In contrast,
CdS/BF4, coated by an inorganic anion, should not have the problem of preventing
photogenerated charges from reaching the catalyst surface. However, the low conversion of
substrate and lack of selectivity remarked that this photocatalyst could suffer aggregation
related to the synthetic procedure involved, which required DMF solvent to obtain the
colloidal solution of quantum dots.46,47
Meanwhile, L-Cys, MPA, and ME ligands demonstrated high conversion and outstanding
selectivity. This effectiveness is attributed not only to the short length of the ligands but also
to the thiyl radicals that could be generated by photogenerated holes on the quantum dot
surfaces. Figure 1 stablished that the photocatalytic conversion of lignin models was led by
the generated thiyl radicals, which were employed to oxidize the BA to benzaldehyde.
Whereas in the case of Ppol, the thiyl radicals favor the CŒ± radical formation by the oxidative
hydrogenation, then, the photogenerated electrons produce the reductive bond cleavage.
Figure S7, demonstrated the kinetic performance of these ligands with Ppol, showing that in

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-db58r ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4914-2918 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

5 hours of reaction have been reached yield products close to 80% and more than 85% of
conversion.
To investigate how the thiyl radicals are involved in the photocatalytic process, different
experiments were conducted. Figure 2A shows the influence in photoluminescence
properties of CdS/OA, when an aliquot of Ppol (0.01 mmol) was added, there was not a
drastic change in the fluorescence. However, when the same quantity of MPA (0.01 mmol)
was introduced in the cuvette with CdS/OA, a quenching was immediately formed. It means
that the photogenerated holes are extracted by the MPA, and there were no recombination
effects. So, the 3-mercaptopropionic acid acts as apparent ‚Äúhole scavenger‚Äù. Once
confirmed the effect of mercapto-carboxylic ligands on the optical properties of QDs, the
presence of radicals produced by photocatalytic study were detected employing DMPO (5,5dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide) and HPLC-MS (see Supporting Information). Figures 2b and
2c, showed the adduct created between the CŒ± radical in Ppol and the thiyl radical of MPA,
respectively. This experiment confirmed that thiyl radicals were created during the
photocatalytic experiment.

After corroborating that thiyl radicals were involved in the photocatalytic reaction, different
lignin models related to Ppol were tested to check the influence of organic substituents and
Œ≥-chain structures. CdS/L-cys was employed as the best photocatalyst to check the
reactivity. Table 1 summarizes the yield product of the compounds obtained by
photocatalytic reaction. It was observed that when Œ≥-chain is incorporated in the structure
the selectivity of products changed; while the cleavage of the C-O bond is maintained (Table
1, entry 2), when electro-donating groups are incorporated in the aromatic ring, the
corresponding aldehydes are obtained. For instance, methoxybenzaldehyde was produced

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-db58r ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4914-2918 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

with 9% of yield product (Table 1, entry 4). Entries 5 and 6 illustrate the conversion observed
when three electron-donating groups were introduced into the aromatic ring. Both entries
led to the formation of aldehyde compounds, albeit in varying proportions. The presence of
a Œ≥-chain resulted in a significant increase in aldehyde yield (22%) compared to the absence
of a Œ≥-chain (8%). This suggests a synergistic interaction between the substituents of the
lignin monomer model and the Œ≥-chains, influencing the mechanistic pathway of the
photocatalyst. Consequently, a combination of cleavages of C-O and C‚ÄìC bonds in Œ≤-O-4
models is demonstrated. However, this hypothesis must be studied employing theoretical
calculations and DFT approaches. A simple experimental study was carried out to detect an
intermediary capable of producing the aldehyde route. Two lignin model dimers employing
3-methoxy donating group, with and without Œ≥-chain were tested with DMPO to verify the
behavior. Figure 3A shows the mechanistic route involved in the photocatalytic reactivity.
Unfortunately, Figures 3B and 3C revealed that identifying any radical other than the one
generated through oxidative dehydrogenation in CŒ± was not possible. So, although
experimental results show a combination of C-C and C-O cleavage pathways for the Œ≤-O-4
bond, further studies are required to validate this hypothesis.

Based on the results of lignin models, we tested the photocatalytic depolymerization of
lignin. First, lignin was extracted from beech wood according to the protocol described in the
Supporting Information. (Lignin Beech-EthanoSolv, BES).48,49 In a typical experiment, 10 mg
of BES were added into the test tube reactor and photocatalytic reactions were following
according to previous experiments. However, after the reaction was completed, the entire
solvent volume was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator. Subsequently, 2 mL
of dichloromethane was used to dissolve the monomers. This solution was analyzed by
GCMS and GCFID to quantify the monomers obtained. The unreacted lignin was studied by
2D-HSQC method. Figure 4 shows the spectra obtained for aliphatic and aromatic region.
The most prominent result was the disappearance of the aliphatic signals associated with
the Œ≤-O-4 bond.50,51 The structures molecules in blue represent the contributions of CŒ±-H,
CŒ≤-H and CŒ≥-H. It was determined that the CŒ≥-H suffered littles changes, which means that
there are remanent fragments unreacted after photocatalytic reactions.

Similarly, in the aliphatic region, signals corresponding to phenyl coumarin and resinol units
remained unchanged during the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that photocatalysis was
effective only in cleaving Œ≤-O-4 bonds. Additionally, the aromatic region (Figure 4c and 4d)
shows a reduction in signal contributions, which may suggest a loss of conjugation. This
results in distinct signals corresponding to non-conjugated molecules that are more
accessible, representing monomers. Similarly, although the signal covers a smaller area, it
exhibits higher intensity.51
Another way to confirm the cleavage of Œ≤-O-4 bonds is by using a semiquantitative 2DHSQC method.37,45 By analyzing the 13C-1H cross-signal assignments (Table S4), it was
possible to correlate the aliphatic region with aromatic signals associated with Œ≤-O-4 bonds.
Figure S10 displays the integral zone linked to these signals. This approach allowed us to
estimate the theoretical maximum monomer yield. Table S6 shows that prior to the reaction,
the theoretical maximum monomer yield was 17.5%, whereas after the reaction, only 2.1%
bonds remained, indicating that the photocatalytic reaction achieved an 88% monomer yield
conversion.

A more accurate method to quantify monomer yield is by using calibration curves for the
major monomers produced, vanillin and syringaldehyde (Figure S11). This aligns with the
results obtained for the lignin model compound, suggesting that the mechanistic pathway
may change when the substrate is highly condensed and contains electron-donating groups.
Various tests were conducted to ensure the reproducibility of lignin BES depolymerization
(Table S7), yielding 2.97% for vanillin and 4.30% for syringaldehyde. To assess monomer
production efficiency, the nitrobenzene oxidation (NBO) method, also known as alkaline
nitrobenzene oxidation (AN oxidation), was applied to analyze the total monomers present
before the BES reaction. Table S7 shows a maximum monomer yield of 4.1% w/w for vanillin
and 4.7% w/w for syringaldehyde. By comparing the total amount of vanillin and
syringaldehyde produced after photocatalytic reactions to the total monomers initially
present, the experimental monomer yield was determined to be 82.6%. This result closely
aligns with the semi-quantitative values obtained using 2D-HSQC. These findings confirm
that the efficiency of monomer production exceeds 80%
The production of monomers and lignin depolymerization can also be analyzed using gel
permeation chromatography (Figure 5). Initially, before the reaction, lignin was
predominantly composed of macrostructures (Mw = 1516). However, after the reaction, most
of these structures were converted into trimers consisting of 3-4 monomer subunits (Mw =
670). Additionally, monomers with molecular weights around 231 and 171 were detected,
which are likely associated with the production of vanillin and syringaldehyde.
In summary, this research demonstrated the vital role of semiconducting QD ligands in the
photocatalytic conversion of lignin, driven by thiyl-mediated ligands. It underlines the
importance of regulating not only the hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties of organic
ligands, which influence dispersion and colloidal stability, but also enabling charge transfer
from the QD core to the catalytic surface. Furthermore, the study found that electrondonating groups in lignin model compounds can significantly impact the mechanistic
pathway of photocatalysis, which has been studied by theoretical DFT studies to identify the

underlying mechanisms. This work confirms that photocatalytic lignin conversion enhances
the production of high monomer yields and functionalized aromatics.
