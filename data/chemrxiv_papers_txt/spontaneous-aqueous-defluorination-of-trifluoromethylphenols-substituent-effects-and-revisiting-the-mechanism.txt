Environmental Significance

15

The environmental transformation of some aryl-CF3 pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals

16

produces trifluoromethylphenols (TFMPs), which are environmental contaminants themselves

17

and can be precursors to the very persistent pollutant trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Alternatively,

18

this study demonstrates that certain TFMPs can undergo complete hydrolytic defluorination in

19

aqueous solutions, depending on their chemical structure. Understanding what drives this

20

spontaneous defluorination can provide insight into why certain C−F bonds can break, despite

21

the general stability of organofluorine compounds. Designing aryl-CF3 compounds to favor

22

defluorination pathways without TFA formation could harness the benefits of the –CF3 moiety

23

in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals while reducing their environmental persistence.

ABSTRACT

26

Trifluoromethylphenols (TFMPs) are environmental contaminants that exist as transformation

27

products of aryl-CF3 pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Their −CF3 moiety raises concerns as

28

it may form problematic fluorinated transformation products such as the persistent pollutant

29

trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This study investigates the hydrolysis and spontaneous

30

defluorination mechanisms of 2-TFMP, 3-TFMP, 4-TFMP, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP under

31

environmentally relevant aqueous conditions, and under alkaline pH to investigate the

32

mechanism of defluorination. 3-TFMP did not undergo hydrolysis. The other TFMPs reacted

33

to primarily form the corresponding hydroxybenzoic acids and fluoride. High-resolution mass

34

spectrometry identified a benzoyl fluoride intermediate in the hydrolysis of 4-TFMP and other

35

dimer-like transformation products of the 4- and 2-Cl-4-TFMP. Density functional theory

36

calculations revealed that the key defluorination step proceeds via an E1cb mechanism, driven

37

by β-elimination. Experimental and computational results demonstrated substituent-dependent

38

differences in reactivity, and the importance of the deprotonation of TFMPs for the hydrolysis

39

reaction to proceed. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the complete

40

defluorination of TFMPs and broader implications for the environmental defluorination of other

41

PFAS.

INTRODUCTION

44

Trifluoromethylphenols (TFMPs) are important building blocks for many pharmaceuticals

45

and agrochemicals containing aromatic trifluoromethyl (aryl-CF3) functional groups (Figure

46

1A).1,2 Fluorine (F) has a small atomic radius, the highest electronegativity, and forms strong

47

bonds with carbon.3 By substituting all hydrogens in a methyl group (−CH3) with F atoms, the

48

performance of aryl-CF3 products are often enhanced through, for example, increased metabolic

49

stability and lipophilicity.3 However, the high stability of C−F bonds raises concerns about the

50

persistence of these compounds and their fluorinated transformation products (TPs) in the

51

environment.4,5 For example, the well-recognized TP of fluoxetine 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol

52

(4-TFMP)6–8 produces the very persistent and very mobile pollutant trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)

53

via photochemical reactions.7,9,10 2-Cl-4-TFMP is a TP of diphenyl ether herbicides like

54

acifluorfen, oxyfluorfen and fluoroglycofen,11–13 yet its environmental chemistry has not been

55

studied. In addition to their identification as transformation products in laboratory studies, 3-

56

TFMP and 4-TFMP have been measured in the environment.14,15 Aryl-CF3 compounds are

57

classified as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) according to OECD definition,16,17 and

58

therefore are receiving heightened interest. Understanding the environmental reactivity of

59

TFMPs is essential for understanding the environmental fate of many aryl-CF3 pharmaceuticals

60

and agrochemicals.

61

Hydrolysis is an important abiotic transformation pathway for organic pollutants. Previous

62

research observed that 2- and 4-TFMP can undergo hydrolysis resulting in spontaneous

63

defluorination under alkaline conditions.6,9,18–23 Reuben G. Jones first reported the base-

64

mediated defluorination of 4-TFMP in 1947, observing that higher concentrations of 4-TFMP

65

spontaneously defluorinated and polymerized in NaOH solutions, eventually stabilizing with

66

no further defluorination.18 Later, in 1973, Sakai and Santi observed complete hydrolytic

67

defluorination of 2- and 4-TFMP in buffered solutions (pH 6.5 – 13), yielding 2- and 4-

68

hydroxybenzoic acid (2- and 4-HBA), respectively.19 More recently, environmental chemists,

69

including the Mabury group,6,20,21 Manfrin et al.,22 and Bhat et al.,9 reported similar

70

defluorination reactions. The spontaneous defluorination of certain TFMPs under

71

environmentally relevant conditions contradicts the common perception that C–F bonds are

72

difficult to activate and that fluoride (F−) is a poor leaving group.24 The mechanism of this

73

spontaneous defluorination remains largely unexplored due to the lack of identified

74

intermediates (IM) and TPs. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain the

75

reactivity differences caused by substituent effects.

76

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in environmental chemistry to

77

calculate the thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions, particularly for environmental

78

chemistry reactions involving reactive transient intermediates that cannot be characterized by

79

common analytical methods.25–27 By optimizing reactants, intermediates, products, transition

80

states (TS) and calculating the proposed reaction pathways, it is possible to assess the

81

plausibility of these pathways from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. Combined

82

with experimental data, DFT calculations have been successfully applied to explain the

83

degradation of PFAS25–27 and the hydrolytic defluorination of fluorinated pharmaceuticals.28

This study investigated the mechanism of TFMPs that undergo spontaneous defluorination

93

in aqueous solutions under environmentally relevant conditions. To explore the substituent

94

effects, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP were studied in aqueous solutions (Figure 1B). Two

95

different pH buffer solutions were used to study the effect of deprotonation on hydrolysis

96

kinetics, and Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to identify TPs.

97

The most plausible spontaneous defluorination mechanism was derived through DFT

98

calculations combined with experimental data.

Chemicals

102

All chemicals were used as received and are described in the Supporting Information (SI-1).

103

Hydrolysis Experiments and Analysis

104

Solutions of 10 mM phosphate (pH 7) or carbonate (pH 10) buffers were prepared in

105

ultrapure water. Stock solutions of 2-, 3-, 4-TFMP (5 mM) and 2-Cl-4-TFMP (1 mM) were

106

prepared in ultrapure water from neat material. Aqueous stock solutions were stored in the dark

107

at 4 °C, and then warmed to room temperature before use. Reaction mixtures were prepared by

108

diluting TFMPs to 10 µM in 10 mM buffers in 100 mL polypropylene volumetric flasks.

109

Experiments were performed in triplicate in polypropylene Falcon tubes wrapped in aluminum

110

foil to minimize exposure to ambient light. Room temperature experiments (~21 °C) were run

111

in a dark drawer with temperatures monitored using an electronic thermometer. To determine

112

the free energy of activation, experiments at pH 10 were also performed at higher temperatures

113

(30 °C and 40 °C) in a hot water bath, where temperatures were recorded with a mercury

114

thermometer. At set time points for each experiment, 1 mL aliquots were mixed with 1M HCl

115

to quench hydrolysis prior to analysis. 5 µL of 1 M HCl was added to the pH 7 aliquots, and 15

116

µL of 1 M HCl was added to the pH 10 aliquots. The concentrations of TFMPs and their

117

corresponding TPs hydroxybenzoic acids (HBAs) were monitored by high performance liquid

118

chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a UV detector. Detailed instrumental conditions are

119

provided in the Table S1. All calibration standards were prepared from neat material dissolved

120

in HPLC grade methanol.

121

Plotting ln (Ct/C0) versus time (t) provided the pseudo-first-order rate constants, k (eq 1).

122

The half-lives (t1/2) of the compounds were determined from eq 2. The Eyring equation (eq 3)

123

was used to plot ln (k/T) with respect to 1/RT for each experiment (eq 4), where k is the pseudo-

124

first order rate constant (s-1); T is the absolute temperature in K; R (8.314 J/(mol·K)) is the gas

125

constant; kB (1.38 × 10–23 J/K) is the Boltzmann constant; h (6.626 × 10–34 J·s) is Planck’s

126

constant; κ is the transmission coefficient (close to 1 in most cases). The slope of the eq 4 fitting

127

plot provided the experimental free energy of activation (ΔG‡, kcal/mol).

To determine the fluorine mass balance of pH 10 hydrolysis experiments, F− formation

129

was tracked by the Fisherbrand Accumet AB250 pH/ISE meter and fluoride ion selective

130

electrode (ISE). Fluorine mass balance experiments were run in duplicates, and 1 mL aliquots

131

were combined with 1 mL of TISAB II prior to analysis. F− calibration standards were prepared

132

from NaF dissolved in ultrapure water. TFMPs were also quantified by HPLC-UV in these

133

separate experiments.

134

The aliquots taken at the beginning and the end of pH 10 hydrolysis experiments were

135

analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with an Orbitrap

136

HRMS to identify TPs. To determine how pH may affect TP formation (i.e., ester formation

137

relying on the deprotonation state of phenol-OH), for 4-TFMP, additional aliquots from pH 7

138

were also analyzed. Detailed UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS parameters are listed in the Table S2.

139

Suspected TPs are listed in Table S6.

Computational Methods

141

DFT calculations were performed by the Gaussian 16 (Revision C.01)29 at 298.15 K and 1

142

atm. Geometry optimization was calculated at M06-2X/6-311+g(d,p) level of theory. Integral

143

equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM) was used to account for solvation

144

effects to structure optimization.30 Frequency analysis was performed to verify there were no

145

imaginary frequencies for local minima and only one single imaginary frequency for transition

146

states (TS). Single-point energy was calculated at M06-2X/6-311++g(2d,2p) level of theory, as

147

the M06-2X functional is suitable for calculating main group element energies,31,32 and the same

148

level of theory has been applied to explain the oxidative degradation of PFAS.25,26

149

We specifically considered a hybrid solvation model for key elementary reactions to

150

account for solvation with water. For the explicit solvation, one, two, five, or six explicit H2O

151

molecules were added to calculations. For the implicit solvation, the solvation free energy was

152

taken into account in the Gibbs free energy (Gf) of a molecule by using solvation model density

153

(SMD) model33 as indicated by Chen et al.28 and Qin et al.34 Gf values were also corrected for

154

the standard state in solution as indicated by Zhang et al.25,26 For reactions with explicit H2O

155

molecules, the Gf of H2O was corrected for its concentration (55.3 M) deviation from its

156

standard state (1 M).28 Refer to SI-3 and SI-9 for more details.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

159

Degradation Kinetics

160

Hydrolysis was observed for 2-TFMP, 4-TFMP, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP at pH 7 and pH 10

161

(Figure 2), but not for 3-TFMP even at elevated temperatures. In a solution buffered with

162

carbonate to a pH of 10.2, and at a temperature of 40 °C for 24 hours, no degradation of 3-

163

TFMP, nor formation of its hydrolysis TP 3-HBA was observed by HPLC-UV (Figure S1). We

164

propose that 3-TFMP is unlikely to undergo hydrolysis in the aqueous environment. It is,

165

however, known to undergo photolysis.9,22

174

TFMP (0.0147 ± 0.0005 h-1) and 2-TFMP (0.0051 ± 0.0002 h-1). Due to the large difference in

175

deprotonation between the TFMPs, we propose that the faster reactivity of 2-Cl-4-TFMP is due

176

to the importance of the role of the deprotonated phenolate species in the hydrolysis reaction.

177

In a pH 7 solution, 2-Cl-4-TFMP, with a pKa value of 7.09, is 47% deprotonated. Conversely,

178

4-TFMP has a pKa value of 8.51 and 2-TFMP has a pKa value of 8.12, and thus, at pH 7 are

179

3.9% and 6.9% deprotonated, respectively (see Table S3). The more the TFMP is deprotonated,

180

the faster it appears to react, suggesting that the pKa of the compound has a considerable impact

181

on reactivity.

182

When the compounds were tested in a solution buffered to pH 10.2 ± 0.1, the reactions

183

rates increased for all TFMPs, and the order of TFMP reaction changed, with 4-TFMP

184

becoming the fastest. At this pH, over 97% of each TFMP was deprotonated (see Table S4 for

185

exact values of deprotonation), so substituent effects could be evaluated. 4-TFMP reacted 41

186

times faster at pH 10.2 with a rate of 0.612 ± 0.008 h-1 compared to its reaction at pH 7 (Figure

187

B and Table 1). This is attributed to more 4-TFMP being deprotonated in the alkaline solution.

188

2-Cl-4-TFMP has a slower reaction rate (0.109 ± 0.004 h-1) than 4-TFMP (Figure 2). Similarly

189

to pH 7, at pH 10 2-TFMP reacted much slower than the other two TFMPs, with a reaction rate

190

of 0.0661 ± 0.0008 h-1. When tested at an elevated temperature of 30 °C in pH 10 solution, we

191

were able to compare our 4-TFMP and 2-TFMP degradation rates with those reported by Sakai

192

and Santi over 50 years ago.19 We found that our measured rates closely align with theirs (Table

193

1), despite the different buffers used: their experiments in 200 mM borate buffer, and ours in

194

10 mM carbonate. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous literature to compare to

195

our 2-Cl-4-TFMP results.

196

4-TFMP is the most well-studied TFMP, however, reports on its hydrolytic stability are

197

conflicting. Some suggest 4-TFMP rapidly loses HF upon dissolution in water,6,20 while others

198

propose that spontaneous defluorination requires conditions that significantly deprotonate the

199

phenol-OH group; otherwise, degradation is minimal, or the hydrolysis defluorination rate is

200

inferred to be extremely slow.19,21 In ultrapure water (pH0 5-6), we observed no degradation of

201

4-TFMP over 4 hours (Figure S1), likely due to full protonation of the phenol-OH group.

202

Therefore, we suggest that the spontaneous defluorination of 4-TFMP in aqueous solution is

203

highly reliant on the deprotonation state of its phenol-OH group.

Transformation Products Identification

212

Hydrolysis of 2-, 4-, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP resulted in the formation of the corresponding

213

HBAs (Figure S2). Since the hydrolysis rates of 2-Cl-4- and 2-TFMP at room temperature

214

(22 °C) are much slower than that of 4-TFMP, raising the temperature to 30 °C and 40 °C

215

allowed their reactions to progress sufficiently to compare their HBA formation to that of 4-

216

TFMP. When the reactions neared completion at pH 10 and 40 °C, HBA was formed in near

217

stoichiometric amounts (> 92%) (Figure S2). The production of HBA results in the release of

218

three equivalents of F− as the other product of the reaction. The fluorine mass balance of TFMPs

219

plus F− (normalized for the 3:1 molar formation ratio) accounted for over 92% of the initial

220

TFMP concentration at each sampling time point (see Figure S3). HBA and F− formation below

221

absolute stoichiometric yields for TFMP hydrolysis can be attributed to the formation of other

222

small amount fluorinated TPs as described below.

223

HRMS was used to search for additional TPs, either as intermediates of the reaction from

224

TFMPs to HBAs, or other stable products of the reaction. In the hydrolysis of 4-TFMP, the

225

benzoyl fluoride TP-4-1 was observed (Figure 3). The formation of this benzoyl fluoride

226

supports the hypothesized pathway where deprotonated 4-TFMP first eliminates F− and forms

227

a highly reactive conjugated electrophile quinone difluoromethide. This quinone then forms an

228

aryl difluoromethanol (−CF2OH) compound through nucleophilic addition with H2O or OH−,

229

and unstable −CF2OH subsequently eliminates HF to form TP-4-1 (Figure 3). Analogous

230

benzoyl fluoride TPs were not observed for other TFMPs, either due to lower formation, or

231

decreased stability of the benzoyl fluorides, resulting in lower concentrations in our samples.

The HRMS of 4-TFMP and 2-Cl-4-TFMP hydrolysis experiments identified novel dimer-

233

like TPs in addition to HBAs, while for 2-TFMP only 2-HBA was detected (Figure 3). TP-4-3,

234

TP-4-4, TP-2Cl-2 and TP-2Cl-3 are ester TPs whose exact mass was identified (see Table S6).

235

We propose the esterification in TFMP hydrolysis only occurs through the deprotonated

236

phenolate groups of either TFMP or HBA reacting via a nucleophilic addition-elimination

237

mechanism with the benzoyl fluoride intermediate. The deprotonation of the phenol-OH is

238

essential for the ester TP formation. At pH 7, 4-TFMP hydrolysis formed only TP-4-2 and TP-

239

4-3, with no detection of TP-4-4 after 24 hours. At this pH, the phenol-OH of 4-HBA remains

240

fully protonated due to its pKa of 9.10 (Table S5). At pH 10, the phenol-OH of 4-HBA is 92%

241

deprotonated. The phenolate (phenol-O−) is a stronger nucleophile than the phenol-OH, and

242

enables the reaction with benzoyl fluoride to produce TP-4-4. 2-TFMP does not form an ester

243

analogous to TP-4-4, because the phenol-OH of 2-HBA (salicylic acid) remains fully protonated

244

at both pH 7 and 10 (see Table S5). The lack of the ester analogous to TP-4-3 for 2-TFMP may

245

be due to the steric hindrance caused by the ortho-position of the fluorinated moiety relative to

246

the phenol-OH. The formation of these esterification products may be limited in the real-world

247

aqueous environment where concentrations are lower, but it is also possible that other aromatic

248

pollutants or organic matter with nucleophilic group (–NH2, –OH) in the environment may react

249

with the benzoyl fluorides.

DFT-Assisted Mechanistic Insights into Spontaneous Defluorination of TFMP

256

Based on our experimental findings, we determined that the TFMP-phenolate is the species

257

undergoing the hydrolysis reaction and not the protonated TFMP. Thus, we considered

258

scenarios where only the TFMP-phenolate exists. Experimental data at pH 10 was used, and

259

DFT calculations were performed for the TFMP-phenolates only.

260

Investigation of Rate-Determining Step (RDS)

261

The initiating step of the spontaneous defluorination of TFMPs involves breaking a strong

262

C–F bond. During this step, the TFMPs undergo dearomatization, leading to an energy increase.

263

We determined that the initiating step is also the rate-determining step (RDS) (Figure 4C and

264

Figure S6). For the RDS, we examined scenarios starting from the TFMP-phenolate and

265

forming hydrated intermediates with varying numbers of explicit water molecules (Figure 4A

266

and Figure S5). Discussion on how solvation changes the free energy of activation (ΔG‡,

267

kcal/mol) is given in the Supplementary Information, SI-9.

268

The DFT-calculated ΔG‡ for the hydrolytic defluorination of 4-TFMP (21.2 kcal/mol) and

269

2-TFMP (22.6 kcal/mol) closely matched the experimental values of 22.6 kcal/mol and 23.5

270

kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2). The calculated ΔG‡ for 2-Cl-4-TFMP falls within the standard

271

deviation range of its experimentally determined ΔG‡. 4-TFMP is the most reactive at pH 10 in

272

our laboratory experiments, and has the lowest ΔG‡ of the three TFMPs determined both

273

experimentally and theoretically. 2-Cl-4-TFMP is more reactive than 2-TFMP (Figure 2B),

274

however, based on our ΔG‡ determination, we cannot attribute the faster reactivity to a lower

275

energy RDS. This is because of the larger relative error of our experimental ΔG‡ of 2-Cl-4-

276

TFMP, compared to the other TFMPs. DFT calculations reported the highest ΔG‡ for 2-Cl-4-

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3b77x ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

277

TFMP, but this does not align with our experimental observations, which suggests the current

278

hybrid solvation model used may be insufficient to fully capture the real conditions. The RDS

279

transition state structures for three TFMPs shared similar key features: stretched C–F bonds,

280

hydrogen-bond interactions between explicit water molecules and the phenolate, and

281

stabilization of the transition state through interactions between the water O-H and the

282

departing F− (Figure 4A).

Investigation of TFMP-phenolate Electronic Properties

298

The –CF3 substituents in TFMPs impart environmentally relevant phenol-OH pKa values

299

as a strong electron-withdrawing groups. Then, the deprotonated phenolates promote the

300

cleavage of a C–F bond via a E1cb mechanism, releasing the first F− of ortho and para –CF3,

301

giving dearomatized quinone difluoromethides. This process is similar to the environmental

302

transformation of the insecticide DDT into DDE via carbanion-mediated chloride elimination.36

303

In contrast, the negative charge does not delocalize to the meta position, rendering the meta –

304

CF3 group resistant to β-elimination, as seen with 3-TFMP, which resists hydrolysis even in a

305

pH 10 solution at 40 ℃. Additional electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring can

306

delocalize the negative charge, thereby decreasing the potential of β-elimination and

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3b77x ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

307

defluorination. NPA analysis determined that the β-carbanion in 2-Cl-4-TFMP has a charge of

308

–0.264, lower (in absolute value) than –0.288 observed in 4-TFMP (Figure 4B), aligning well

309

with lower observed reactivity of 2-Cl-4-TFMP compared to 4-TFMP. Bond dissociation

310

energy (BDE) calculations further reveal that 4-TFMP and 2-Cl-4-TFMP have equivalent C–F

311

BDEs (120.6 kcal/mol), whereas 2-TFMP has a higher BDE of 122.3 kcal/mol, corresponding

312

to its consistently lowest reactivity of the TFMPs studied.

313
314

Investigation of the Quinone Difluoromethide Intermediate Rearomatization

315

After the initiating rate-determining step, the energy profiles of 2-, 4-, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP

316

are generally downhill, involving barrierless reactions and reactions with low energy barriers

317

that lead to the rearomatization of the reactive quinone difluoromethide intermediates (Figure

318

4C and Figure S6).

319

In Figure 4C, the quinone difluoromethide intermediate IM-4-1 can undergo a barrierless

320

reaction with OH– to form the same IM-4-2 (ΔG = –39.1 kcal/mol, see potential energy surface

321

scan results in Figure S7), a rearomatization process that is both thermodynamically and

322

kinetically favorable. For 2-Cl-4-TFMP and 2-TFMP, the barrierless reaction between OH– and

323

their corresponding quinone difluoromethides is also the more favored pathway (illustrated in

324

Figure S6, with potential energy surface scan results shown in Figure S7). These quinone

325

difluoromethides are highly reactive electrophiles, rapidly captured by OH– or other

326

nucleophiles, making them undetectable via regular HRMS or 19F NMR.

327

For the intermediate IM-4-2, the unstable –CF2OH structure readily eliminates HF via a

328

hydrogen-bonding network. Adding explicit water molecules to the TS of this HF-elimination

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3b77x ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

329

reduced ΔG‡ from 24.8 to 13.3 kcal/mol, consistent with prior studies.25 Alternatively, IM-4-2

330

can undergo intramolecular proton transfer to form IM-4-3, where the negatively charged

331

oxygen in –CF₂O– facilitates the leaving of F– with ΔG‡ of only 8.2 kcal/mol, making it highly

332

favorable kinetically. Similar scenarios are observed for 2-Cl-4-TFMP and 2-TFMP. After the

333

removal of first two F−, all three TFMPs generate the corresponding (deprotonated) benzoyl

334

fluorides, which reacts either with H2O/OH− to eliminate the last F− and to form benzoic acids

335

or with other nucleophiles such as phenol-O− to form dimer-like TPs.

336
337

Defluorination compared to other PFAS

338

Despite the extreme environmental persistence of many organofluorine compounds due to

339

the strength of the C–F bond, some compounds undergo partial or complete spontaneous

340

defluorination. In this study, specific TFMPs achieved complete defluorination because, in the

341

RDS, the negative charge of the phenolate is delocalized through conjugation, driving β-

342

elimination of a single F− to form reactive electrophilic α,β-unsaturated ketones (Figure 1C).

343

These α,β-unsaturated ketones immediately undergo further reactions to eliminate the second

344

and the third F−.

345

Although one carbon involved in the β-elimination defluorination reaction of TFMPs is an

346

aryl-carbon (sp2 hybridized), and many PFAS molecules are composed of alkyl-carbons (sp3

347

hybridized), similar β-elimination defluorination mechanisms have been observed in other

348

PFAS chemistry and usually occur in the early stages of the overall reaction. For instance,

349

perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) can undergo decarboxylation in polar aprotic solvents, forming

350

a perfluoroalkyl carbanion that drives β-elimination of an adjacent C–F bond to give a

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3b77x ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-8329 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

351

perfluoroalkene.27 DFT calculations revealed a ΔG‡ of 19.5 kcal/mol for this β-elimination

352

step,27 comparable to the ΔG‡ values observed for TFMPs in our study. For polyfluorinated

353

compounds, it has been reported that the presence of easily removable H or Cl atoms can

354

indirectly trigger defluorination.37,38 Multiple electron-withdrawing C–F bonds can weaken

355

other chemical bonds to facilitate dissociation. In this work, the phenol-O–H bonds in TFMPs

356

are more readily dissociated than the equivalent non-fluorinated methylphenols (cresols). For

357

example, the pKa of 4-TFMP is 8.51 compared to 10.25 for 4-methylphenol, due to the

358

trifluoromethyl group stabilizing the carbanion. For sp3-sp3 hybridized carbons, 6:2, 8:2, 10:2

359

fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (n:2 FTCA, Cn-1F2n-1CF2CH2COOH, n = 6/8/10) can transform

360

into n:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (n:2 FTUCA, Cn-1F2n-1CF=CHCOOH, n =

361

6/8/10) biotically or abiotically.39,40 This abiotic transformation is facilitated by a base,39,40

362

likely through the deprotonation of a C–H adjacent to the carboxyl group, leading to β-

363

elimination and the formation of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Similarly, 8:2

364

fluorotelomer aldehyde (8:2 FTAL, C7F15CF2CH2CHO) is unstable in water, and loses HF to

365

produce the 8:2 fluorotelomer α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (8:2 FTUAL, C7F15CF=CHCHO).41 A

366

recent study suggest that an unsaturated perfluorinated compound E-perfluoro-4-methylpent-

367

2-enoic acid [(CF3)2CFCF=CFCOOH] can undergo microbial defluorination, where similar

368

base-facilitated β-elimination defluorination contributes as part of the mechanism.37

CONCLUSIONS

371

Here, we report a comprehensive investigation into the hydrolysis kinetics and

372

defluorination mechanisms of TFMPs in the aqueous phase. Hydrolysis experiments were

373

conducted in pH 7 phosphate buffer and pH 10 carbonate buffer to evaluate the reactivity of 2-,

374

3-, 4-, 2-Cl-4-TFMP. Among these, 2-, 4-, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP showed significant spontaneous

375

defluorination in aqueous solutions, while no hydrolysis of 3-TFMP was observed. The

376

reactivity of TFMPs was strongly influenced by the deprotonation state of the phenol-OH. At

377

pH 7, the TFMPs were only partially deprotonated, resulting in slow reaction kinetics. At pH

378

10, all TFMPs were fully deprotonated, leading to faster reaction kinetics, with relative

379

reactivities following the order 4-TFMP > 2-Cl-4-TFMP > 2-TFMP.

380

HBAs and F− were the major TPs for the three TFMPs, as confirmed by their molar yields

381

and fluorine mass balance. Orbitrap-HRMS identified new TPs, including a benzoyl fluoride

382

intermediates for 4-TFMP and dimer-like products for 4-TFMP and 2-Cl-4-TFMP, offering

383

additional insights into the reaction mechanisms.

384

The key RDS for defluorination involved β-elimination via an E1cb mechanism, initiated

385

by the deprotonated phenolate. DFT calculations provided detailed insights into this process,

386

highlighting the critical role of water molecule solvation in stabilizing the phenolate and

387

facilitating β-elimination. The reactivity was influenced by both the C–F bond BDE and the

388

negative charge distribution on the phenolate of the TFMPs. Additionally, DFT calculations

389

revealed that following the RDS, the rearomatization of the reactive quinone difluoromethide

390

intermediate was highly favorable both thermodynamically and kinetically. These findings

391

enhance our understanding of defluorination pathways for TFMPs and provide insights into the

392

defluorination chemistry of other PFAS. This may be used to design aryl-CF3 compounds that

393

favour defluorination in the environment, thus minimizing their environmental impact.
