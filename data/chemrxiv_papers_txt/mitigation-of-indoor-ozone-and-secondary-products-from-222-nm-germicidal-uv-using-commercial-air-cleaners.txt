Far-UVC light, especially germicidal UV light at 222 nm (GUV222), has received considerable
attention for its potential to deactivate airborne pathogens indoors and prevent the spread of
infectious disease. However, GUV222 also generates ozone (O3), posing human health risks and
initiating additional photochemistry that may degrade indoor air quality. Air cleaners pose an
opportunity to counteract the drawbacks of GUV222 by removing harmful byproducts; however,
this has never been demonstrated. Here, we conduct laboratory experiments in a 7.5 m3 Teflon

chamber using two commercially available air cleaners—a manganese-oxide-catalyst “ozone
cleaner” and an activated-carbon-HEPA “volatile organic compound (VOC) + particulate matter
(PM) cleaner”—in tandem with a GUV222 lamp. We show that both cleaner types remove a wide
range of chemical species, including many not specifically targeted by the cleaners. Application
of chamber results to a photochemical model environment suggests that a single cleaner can
achieve modest reductions in O3 levels and substantial reductions in secondary pollutant levels
within typical indoor environments. These results indicate that indoor air pollutants from GUV222
can be mitigated through the use of air cleaning technology, thereby improving indoor air quality
while maximizing the potential benefit of germicidal UV for human health.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought substantial attention to air cleaning technologies that can be
deployed for mitigating transmission of airborne pathogens in indoor environments. One notable
example is germicidal UV (GUV), in which ultraviolet irradiation is used to inactivate pathogens1;
targets that can be inactivated by GUV include the microbes that cause COVID-19, measles,
influenza, and tuberculosis.2–4 A major recent focus has been the use of far-UVC sources,
particularly 222 nm KrCl excimer lamps (GUV222).4,5 Light at this wavelength is safer for human
exposure5,6 than older GUV technologies such as 254 nm light,4,7 enabling whole room irradiation
even when the room is occupied.

53

55

One concern with GUV222 is the potential for the formation of ozone (O3), a major respiratory
irritant. At short wavelengths (<242 nm), molecular oxygen photodissociates (R1), which can lead
to O3 formation (R2).8

Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated non-negligible O3 production from GUV222.9,10 In
addition to O3 itself being a health risk,11 it can initiate further photochemistry, including formation
of the hydroxyl radical (OH). O3 and OH can react with alkenes in the indoor air and on indoor
surfaces, leading to the formation of oxidized volatile organic compounds (OVOCs).12,13 Such
chemistry can also produce secondary organic aerosol (SOA), including ultrafine particles, which
poses a major human health hazard.14,15 Previous studies have demonstrated the formation of these
secondary byproducts when using GUV222.16–20 A simple approach for mitigating exposure to such
secondary pollutants is increased ventilation;16,21 however, this is not always possible in all
situations.

An alternative approach is the use of commercially available air cleaners to actively remove
pollutants from the indoor air. Key technologies include manganese oxide catalysts to decompose
O3 to O222–24 (as well as oxidize formaldehyde (CH2O)25–27), activated carbon to adsorb gas-phase
organic species and O3,28,29 and HEPA filters to remove particulate matter (including SOA).30
These air cleaning technologies present a promising opportunity to mitigate the negative effects of

However, to the best of our knowledge, this has never been investigated in a systematic way.

Here, we assess the efficacy of air cleaners in mitigating byproducts from a GUV222 lamp within a
Teflon chamber. In addition to studying the removal of O3 generated from the lamp, we also
examined the removal of secondary organic products (OVOCs, SOA) generated from the reaction
of O3 with added alkenes: limonene, a major component of cleaning products, and 6-methylhept5-en-2-one (6-MHO), formed from the oxidation of squalene in skin oil. Because oxidative and
photolytic air cleaning technologies may themselves risk the formation of byproducts,31,32 we
focused solely on technologies based on physical removal (sorption, filtration) only. We observe
substantial removal of a number of unwanted byproducts and other indoor pollutants, including
many that are not directly targeted by the cleaners. Experimental results are then used to inform a
photochemical model of air cleaner operation alongside GUV222 irradiation in a typical indoor
environment, to investigate the efficacy of air cleaners in mitigating harmful byproducts in more
realistic indoor settings.

Experiments were carried out in a 7.5 m3 Teflon chamber, fitted with inlet ports for the introduction
of chemical species and clean air flow, and outlet ports for instrument sampling.33 Clean air was
supplied via a zero-air generator (Aadco Model 737) at a total flow of 20 L min-1 [equivalent to
0.16 air changes per hour (ACH)]; some of this flow first was sent through a bubbler filled with
Milli-Q water to increase the humidity of the chamber. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C and
35% relative humidity in order to replicate typical indoor air conditions. A summary of
experiments used in this study is provided in Table S1.

GUV222 irradiation was supplied via a single KrCl excimer lamp (OSLUV Open Luminaire fitted
with an Ushio Care 222 B1 emitter, peak emission at 222 nm), placed directly outside the Teflon
chamber at the center of one side (the same setup as used in previous GUV222 studies using this
chamber20) (Figure S1). The average fluence rate in the chamber was estimated to be 3.0 ± 0.2
μW cm-2 based on chemical actinometry measurements; this is roughly consistent to (but
somewhat lower than) estimates based on a geometric projection of the irradiance field (Section
S2.1). Two air cleaners were tested: a manganese oxide catalyst-based cleaner (CDA-250,
Oxidation Technologies) hereafter referred to as “ozone cleaner”, and an activated carbon- and
HEPA-based cleaner (GC VOC, IQAir) hereafter referred to as “VOC + PM cleaner”. In both
cases, the cleaner was placed along the bottom of the chamber in one of the corners, positioned
~0.5 m away from the walls (Figure S1). To insert the cleaner into the chamber, a large port on
the chamber side was opened to place the cleaner in, and the port was then closed and the chamber
flushed overnight. The VOC + PM cleaner was operated at a medium flow setting, corresponding
to a flow rate of 61 L s-1, in order to be most comparable with the measured flow rate of the ozone
cleaner (59 L s-1; see Table S2 for air cleaner parameters), though there may be uncertainty in the
measurements.

For all experiments, 10 ppb of a dilution tracer (hexafluorobenzene (C6F6), 99%, Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to the chamber via injection in the clean air make-up flow line (Figure S1), followed
by a 15-minute waiting period to allow mixing and obtain a stable signal. The subsequent steps
(turning on the lamp, turning on the air cleaner, and/or adding chemical species) were then
performed, in an order that varied with each type of experiment. For experiments with added VOC,
either 50 ppb of (R)-(+)-limonene (C10H16, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) or 50 ppb of 6-methylhept-5-en2-one (6-MHO) (C8H14O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected. For chemical actinometry
experiments, 50 ppb of tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected. For the
NO2 removal experiment, 80 ppb of NO2 was introduced to the chamber by metering the flow from
a standard cylinder (1.93 ppm, balance air, Linde). No aerosol seed or any other species were
added.

Real-time measurements of gas- and particle-phase species in the chamber were conducted with a
suite of analytical instrumentation, summarized in Table S3. Ozone was measured with a UV
absorption O3 monitor (2BTech). NOx measurements were made with a chemiluminescence
NO−NO2−NOx analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a cavity-attenuated phase shift NO2
monitor (CAPS, Aerodyne Research, Inc.). A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector
(GC-FID, SRI) was used to monitor limonene, hexafluorobenzene, and tetrachloroethylene. A
modified PTR334 was run as an ammonium chemical ionization mass spectrometer (NH4+-CIMS)
in most experiments to provide measurements of OVOCs, including 6-MHO; in limonene removal
experiments, the instrument was run as a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) to
measure limonene (see Table S1 for experiment summary). Fiber laser-induced fluorescence
(FILIF35) was used for the measurement of CH2O. An LI-7000 CO2/H2O analyzer (LI-COR)
provided CO2 measurements. Gas-phase mass spectrometric data were background-subtracted and
corrected for dilution. Particle measurements included an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS,
Aerodyne Research, Inc.37) for chemical composition and a scanning mobility particle sizer
(SMPS, TSI) for size distributions. Particle-phase data were corrected for dilution and wall losses.
Further details on data analysis and quantification approaches are described in Section S1.1.

First, we examined direct emissions of air pollutants from the cleaners, which may themselves be
sources of undesired gases: in our earlier work, we demonstrated that many commercially available
air cleaners emit species such as CH2O.32 Both cleaners studied were found to emit CO2 and water
vapor when turned on, as shown in Figures S7 and S8. The VOC + PM cleaner had no other
apparent emissions. The ozone cleaner also emitted NO (Figure S9) and acetone (Figure S10)
when turned on. The NO emissions were fitted to a rate of 0.005 ppb s-1 (Figure S9), though slight
discrepancies between modeled and measured data suggest that the ozone cleaner may remove NO
in addition to emitting it.

149
150

We note that other species that we cannot measure might also be emitted; for instance, alkanes are
not detected by our instrument suite. Further, changes in emission rates may occur over longer

timescales than explored here. Despite these uncertainties, these measurements of direct emissions
highlight the need to fully characterize air cleaners in order to better understand their implications
for indoor air quality. The emissions can both initiate chemistry, as demonstrated by the NOx
chemistry from the ozone cleaner’s NO emissions (Section S4.1 and Figure S11), and also may
be harmful to human health. Such trade-offs must be considered to fully assess the net health
benefit of the air cleaners.

The effectiveness of the air cleaners for removal of O3 from GUV222 was investigated by operating
the cleaners in the chamber alongside a 222 nm KrCl excimer lamp. Figure 1 shows O3 levels
when turning on first the GUV222 lamp and then the cleaner. Results are shown for the ozone
cleaner (Figure 1a) and the VOC + PM cleaner (Figure 1b). The O3 production rate during the
lamp-on periods was measured as 25 ± 0.2 ppb hr-1, consistent with expectations and in line with
previous studies.9 When either air cleaner was turned on, the O3 dropped extremely rapidly,
indicating efficient removal by the cleaners. The removal rates (determined by fitting the decrease
to a simple exponential) were 0.33 min-1 for the ozone cleaner and 0.41 min-1 for the VOC + PM
cleaner. We note that for the ozone cleaner, due to the NO emission, there may be some O3 removal
via NO + O3 reaction. The VOC + PM cleaner, which contains activated carbon filters, was able
to remove O3 as quickly as the ozone cleaner, in agreement with previous studies demonstrating
O3 removal by activated carbon.29,38,39 Even with the GUV222 lamp on, each cleaner ensured that
O3 steady-state levels were very low (~1.2 ppb), only slightly higher than the lamp-off baseline
(~0.7 ppb). As shown in Figure S6, when the cleaners were turned off, O3 immediately resumed
growing in at the previous rate. These findings demonstrate that air cleaners can indeed mitigate
O3 produced by GUV222 lamps when run concurrently. Air cleaners are thus a promising way to
counteract O3 generation from indoor use of GUV222, though as mentioned above, trade-offs with
emissions must be considered for each specific use case.

To explore the effects of air cleaners on O3-initiated chemistry (e.g., ozonolysis of alkenes present
in the indoor environment), a set of experiments were run in which limonene (a common ingredient
in fragrances and cleaning products) was added to the chamber. Adding limonene and then turning
on the GUV222 lamp led to the formation of secondary products in both the gas- and particle-phase,
including (but not limited to) limonaldehyde, CH2O, and SOA (Figure S12). These products are
consistent with the expected chemistry of limonene reacting with O3.40–42 Such oxidation products
have also been observed in previous experimental studies and predicted in modeling studies of
limonene in the presence of GUV222.16,43,17,18,20

Both the ozone cleaner and VOC + PM cleaner were found to remove the oxidation products, as
well as remove limonene (tested in separate experiments; see Table S1). Figure 2 shows the
removal of these species (limonene, limonaldehyde, CH2O, and SOA) by each air cleaner,
normalized by the respective species concentration when the cleaner was turned on. Gas-phase
species were removed efficiently by both cleaner types. Notably, CH2O, a major hazardous indoor
air pollutant,44 was completely removed within 10 minutes of turning on the ozone cleaner,
consistent with expectations based on previous studies of CH2O oxidation on manganese oxide
catalysts. The VOC + PM cleaner reduced CH2O concentrations by 90% within 20 minutes, and
achieved complete removal on a longer time scale (Figure S13).

Also shown in Figure 2 is removal of other species relevant to ozone chemistry and/or indoor air
quality. Additional experiments were run with the introduction of 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one (6MHO), a compound formed from the ozonolysis of squalene, a major component of human skin
oil.45 Both cleaners removed 6-MHO, as well as its ozonolysis products (the major product being
4-oxopentanal, C5H8O2;46,47 see Figure S14), highlighting the wide range of organic compounds
that air cleaning technologies can mitigate. Removal of inorganic species such as NO2 (another
indoor air pollutant) and halogenated species such as the dilution tracer, C6F6 (Figure S15), was
observed as well.

SOA removal was substantially different between the two devices, with the VOC + PM cleaner
achieving ~20 times faster removal than the ozone cleaner (Table 1). The HEPA filter used in the
VOC + PM cleaner allows for efficient removal of particles, whereas the SOA removal by the
ozone cleaner occurs only via physical losses of particles within the device. Despite these vast
differences in removal rates between cleaners, for each individual cleaner the rate of removal was
largely independent of particle size. Both removed ultrafine (<100 nm) particles at similar rates to
larger particles (Figure S16), indicating their ability to mitigate not only fine particulate matter
but ultrafine particles (which represent a particular health hazard)15 as well.

Table 1 gives the clean air delivery rate (CADR), the rate at which a cleaner delivers air free of a
given species, of each species for both cleaners. The CADRs were calculated from the baselinecorrected decay of a species, subtracting dilution and wall loss, and multiplying by chamber
volume; further calculation details are given in Section S1.2. These CADR values are notably
higher than CADRs measured for other air cleaners in our previous work,32 likely due to
differences in volumetric throughput and removal technology between the various cleaners. Given
the largely effective removal of particles and many gas-phase species by the air cleaners, both
GUV222 and non-GUV222 indoor scenarios likely benefit from operation of these devices.

Extrapolation to Indoor Environments

The laboratory chamber experiments described above demonstrate that air cleaners can efficiently
remove a variety of species formed from GUV222 irradiation, including both O3 and secondary
pollutants (OVOCs, SOA), as well as other species found in indoor air (other VOCs, NO2).
However, the laboratory chamber is a highly simplified system, with many factors (such as room
size, ventilation, deposition, and fluence rate) differing between the chamber environment and
real-world indoor environments.

Here, we applied the results of the chamber experiments to a simple photochemical model in order
to investigate the implications of using air cleaners in typical indoor environments. The model,
described in Barber et al.,16 characterizes key indoor air processes—VOC emissions, background
O3 in the ventilation air, loss of O3 to the ventilation system, and O3 deposition onto surfaces. Air
cleaner removal of species was added into the existing model, using rates based on the CADRs
measured in this study (see Section S5.1 for more detailed information). The model includes two
“lumped” VOCs: one that reacts only with OH, and another that reacts with both OH and O3. All
oxidation products are lumped and allowed to react with OH, and SOA is formed based on a
specified yield (10%). As in Barber et al., a range of irradiation levels and ventilation rates were
explored. Fluence rates spanning from 0 to 15 μW cm-2 were used to cover a wide range of
scenarios, from no GUV to high-intensity irradiation. Ventilation rates ranged from 0.1 to 10 air
changes per hour (ACH), spanning common indoor values and including the minimum American
Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommendations
(homes: 0.35 ACH, offices: ∼2−3 ACH, and healthcare settings: 10 ACH).48 A room size of 150
m3, equivalent to that of a small-to-medium sized classroom or office, was used to replicate a
representative indoor environment in which GUV222 might be deployed.49,50 Given the air flow
rates of the cleaners (~216 m3 hr-1, Table S2), their operation in a room of this size provides an
increase of only ~1.44 effective air changes per hour (eACH); hence, the modeled removal of a
species by a given cleaner will be substantially slower than that observed in our smaller laboratory
chamber, where the cleaners provided an increase of ~28.8 eACH (Section S5.2).

As the ozone cleaner emits NO which may lead to NOx chemistry, the importance of the emissions
was investigated by adding NO emission into the model (using the rate measured in the chamber
and scaled to the model room size). Only emission was included, with no further chemistry or loss
processes besides ventilation, to provide an upper bound on the steady-state NO in the model
scenarios. As shown in Figure S18, even in the lowest-ventilation case (0.1 ACH), the steadystate NO level from the emission is only 9 ppb. This is significantly lower than concentrations

Figure 3 shows key model results. Steady-state concentrations of O3, gas-phase oxidation
products, and SOA are provided for indoor scenarios with no air cleaner (Figure 3a), with the
ozone cleaner (Figure 3b), and with the VOC + PM cleaner (Figure 3c). The steady-state O3 levels
were reduced by 8-28% when running either cleaner type compared to the no-cleaner scenario.
The O3 concentrations in these indoor scenarios are largely governed by influx from the outdoor
air via the ventilation system—hence the increasing O3 with increasing ventilation rate—alongside
O3 production by GUV222. Because operation of the cleaners adds up to ~1.44 eACH, there is only
a small increase in fresh air delivery, and thus only modest reductions in the steady-state O3 levels
were achieved for these conditions. The model output shown in Figure 3 is based on using one air
cleaner, and so the addition of a second cleaner would provide greater reduction in O3 levels (see
Figure S19). Furthermore, the model operates on the assumption that the room is always wellmixed, which may not be accurate in real-world scenarios. Since there may be local areas of high
O3, particularly near the GUV222 lamp, the placement of the air cleaner could impact its
effectiveness in decreasing overall O3 levels within the room. Real-world testing, modeling, and/or
optimization of the relative placement of the two represent important areas of future work.

Figure 3. Effects of ventilation rate and GUV222 fluence rate on modeled indoor air quality across
scenarios with (a) no air cleaner, (b) an ozone cleaner, and (c) a VOC + PM cleaner. Shown are
steady-state concentrations of O3, organic oxidation products (OVOC), and SOA as predicted by
the photochemical box model. Additional model results are given in Figure S20.

The presence of O3 in the indoor scenarios enables OH production (model output of [OH] is shown
in Figure S20), and both of these oxidants can react with VOCs leading to the formation of gasand particle-phase oxidation products (OVOCs and SOA, respectively). Modeled steady-state
concentrations of OVOCs and SOA are shown in Figure 3. For these secondary products, the air
cleaners were able to reduce the concentrations substantially, in some cases by an order of
magnitude or more. The formation of secondary products depends on the concentrations of VOC
and O3, and since both reactants are removed by the cleaners, there is a multiplicative decrease in
the product formation rate. Additionally, the products themselves are also removed by the cleaners,
leading to an even greater decrease in steady-state concentrations. Hence, the net effect of the air

cleaners is a dramatic reduction of secondary products, despite the relatively low eACH increase;
the benefit is especially pertinent for the low-ventilation cases.

The power of air cleaners for removal of indoor pollutants suggests that they can be beneficial in
minimizing O3-related risks associated with indoor use of GUV222, particularly under lowventilation conditions. They can also be useful for improving indoor air quality in non-GUV222
settings: in the non-irradiated (0 μW cm-2) scenarios, operation of the cleaners reduced OVOC and
SOA concentrations by up to 97% (depending on ventilation). Though direct emissions by the
cleaners themselves may be of concern and require greater characterization, these results
demonstrate the general efficacy of commercially available sorption- and filtration-based air
cleaners for a variety of indoor environments and irradiation levels.

Any indoor use of GUV222 must consider the trade-offs between germicidal benefits and air quality
disbenefits. Though a detailed analysis of these trade-offs is beyond the scope of this work, we
show that air cleaner removal of pollutants can potentially shift the trade-off substantially, by
improving air quality and thus increasing the range of scenarios where GUV222 could provide a
net health benefit. Uncertainties remain, including the longevity of air cleaner efficacy and changes
in emissions over extended periods of use, as well as the effect of the placement of cleaners within
a room. These are critical areas of future work in understanding and optimizing the use of air
cleaners, with or without GUV222, to promote healthier indoor environments.
