Abstract

Sustainable energy materials for energy storage applications are crucial for a reliable energy
transition. However, evaluating material sustainability in early stages of energy material
research is a big challenge, as it is difficult to predict the final industrial process and supply
chain of the investigated material. In this work we showcase that a sustainability evaluation
can already be conducted in the early stage of electrocatalyst research. We provide a case
study of two highly active alkaline oxygen evolution catalysts La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and
La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ with a thin film model-catalyst approach. For the sustainability evaluation, we
consider the material criticality, compare precursor prices, conduct an environmental impact
analysis of the precursors based on life cycle assessment and provide a qualitative discourse
for social impacts of raw material extraction. We find that La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ has a reduced
environmental footprint, smaller precursor supply risk and 10 times lower precursor price
compared to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ. However, for both perovskites the high environmental impact
and high supply risk of lanthanum is of immediate concern towards larger scale application
purposes. Sustainability evaluation in the early stages of energy material research can be a
great chance to develop new material selection strategies leveraging sustainability in later
stages of materials research for the energy transition.

1. Introduction
Countries around the world attempt to reduce their dependence on coal, oil and gas in the
energy, industry, and transportation sector1. For that, renewable energy generation, energy
storage and conversion technologies are mandatory for a reliable energy transition and a
proceeding defossilization of the economy. With that, the global economy develops from a
fossil fuel-intensive to a material-intensive economy, as large quantities of complex functional
materials are required for technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, electrolyzers, fuel
cells and batteries2–4. It is estimated that for fulfilling the Paris climate agreement, the mineral
requirements will quadruple by 2040 compared to today’s mineral needs in the energy
sector2,3. The shift to material-intensive large-scale applications leads to new criticalities of raw
materials, and technological, scientific, economic, environmental, and social challenges.
Energy storage and conversion technologies such as batteries, fuel cells and electrolyzers are
particularly crucial for capping energy supply and demand gaps in the energy grid and are
required for several power-to-X applications5–7. For example, water electrolysis such as alkaline
water electrolysis (AWE) is a key pillar in the transformation process towards a defossilized
economy. The hydrogen produced from renewable sources can be used directly as final energy
carrier or can be converted further together with captured CO2 into e.g. methane, synthesis
gas, liquid fuels, or other chemicals 5,6. The battery, fuel cell and electrolyzer technological core
components typically consist of at least a cathode, an anode, and a solid or liquid electrolyte.
Typical elements required for these core components include noble metals such as iridium (Ir),
ruthenium (Ru) and platinum (Pt) for electrolyzers and fuel cells8,9. Furthermore, elements
such as manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) are used for the cathode in
lithium-ion batteries10 and solid oxide fuel cells 11, and in alkaline water electrolyzers for both
electrodes8. Most of these elements are considered critical for the global economy. For
example, the EU categorizes several of the materials shown in Figure 1a critical 12 (see red
colored materials), highlighting that key materials for electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries are
linked to a possible vulnerability of large economies such as the EU 12.
To limit or substitute those elements of concern, the early-stage materials science community
makes large efforts to shed light on the chemical and physical properties of energy materials
that are “less scarce”, “more earth abundant” and “less costly” than state-of-the-art
electrolyzer, fuel cell and battery materials 13–19. However, different terms such as “shortage”,
“scarcity”, or “earth abundance” and the price are often not clearly defined and not quantified

for the investigated materials. Moreover, the environmental, geopolitical, or social impacts are
seldomly considered, although they are of high importance for the prevention of potential
supply chain disruptions, ecosystem damage or social disparities. In general, early-stage
research is not and should not be limited by selective material choices, as only unrestricted
research across the full periodic table can uncover groundbreaking findings of natural
phenomena and material properties. At the same time, a more holistic material evaluation in
early-stage material research presents an opportunity for sustainable energy material research
and development from the onset.
For this reason, there are growing efforts by governmental and scientific institutions to
quantify potential risks for material supply, ecological, economic and social aspects as well as
technological requirements for new electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries 12,20–29. Recently, the
effort for holistic material choice evaluation in early-stage material development was
recommended by Klemenz et al. who explain that a “second-best” performance material can
be more sustainable in a holistic evaluation than the material with the higher performance 23.
Helbig et al. recommend to evaluate material sustainability in basic research to estimate
possible supply risks and environmental impacts using the example of yttrium manganese
oxide (YMnO3) for electronic applications 24. Porzio and Scown recommend to compare new
battery technology performances and their potential environmental impact to push
sustainable battery development 25. Eikeng et al. provide an extensive study on the future
availability of critical raw materials for commercial hydrogen electrolyzer and fuel cell
technologies. They point out the potential supply lacks of, for example, nickel for AWE or
platinum group metals for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers 30. Yet, this study includes
neither an estimate of new or alternative materials that are in early-stage development nor a
full sustainability evaluation. However, conducting a more holistic material evaluation in earlystage materials research is extremely challenging because the observed material’s
functionality as well as physical and chemical properties in laboratory scale model systems
need to be projected to global material supply chains and industrial application standards.
Here, we showcase how a more holistic sustainability material evaluation can be conducted
in early stages of electrocatalyst research. First, we briefly survey important sustainability
parameters and their evaluations applied for energy materials, because the know-how and
implementation of different sustainability parameters is not yet common practice for energy
material research in early stages 23,24,26. Based on this we provide a case study where we

compare the two perovskite oxides La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ as electrocatalysts for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in AWE with a model catalyst approach.
We choose perovskite oxide ABO3 catalysts as they are often discussed as attractive candidates
for low temperature AWE catalysts at the anode 18,31–38. Perovskite oxides crystalize in an ABO3
structure where the A-site is typically occupied by rare earth elements or alkaline earth
elements and the B-site by transition metals (Figure 1b)39. Their variety of physical and
chemical properties39 makes them also suitable for many applications such as solid oxide fuel
cells11,40,41 or high temperature water electrolysis 42,43. Figure 1b shows a sketch of an
integrated AWE stack with the perovskite oxide OER catalyst layer that is marked in red. In
AWE, perovskite oxides may improve the sluggish kinetics of the OER 31,32, in which hydroxyl
ions are oxidized to oxygen gas at the perovskite catalyst interface (Figure 1b).

Figure 1: a) elements that are typically used for electrolyzers, fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries

in the EU criticality assessment 2023, the elements in blue are considered non-critical. Ni is a
strategic element and Carbon (C*) is natural graphite 12. b) Integrated AWE stack: anode and
cathode consist of a current collector and catalyst layer. On the cathode, the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) takes place and on the anode, the OER is catalyzed by the perovskites.

La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ is a widely studied OER catalyst exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity in low
temperature AWE,33,35,44–46 (similar to the record-activity but structurally unstable
(Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ)37,38,47,48). However, strontium (Sr) and Co are elements of high concern
due to their expected depletion of known reserves in the next 20-50 years and 50-100 years,
respectively49. In contrast, calcium (Ca) and Fe are considered to have unlimited supply in a
foreseeable future23,49,50 and some studies have shown that La 0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ shows catalytic
activity in low temperature AWE 37,51. To compare the catalytic activity of the two perovskite
oxides in the OER we take a thin film model catalyst approach as it facilitates the determination
of intrinsic catalytic activity and leads to a reliable comparability of the catalyst performance
as a basis for an early-stage sustainability evaluation 52.
The case study is applied to assess both electrochemical activity as well as the material
sustainability with material criticality, economic, environmental and social parameters. For the
sustainability evaluation, we consider the electrocatalyst material criticality based on the
critical raw material study of the European Commission 12. Furthermore, we compare precursor
prices of the two catalysts and consider several environmental impacts based on life cycle
assessment (LCA). Additionally, we make a qualitative discourse for social impacts of raw
material extraction. The case study reveals that the use of Ca and Fe can indeed yield
significant improvements in terms of material criticality, precursor prices and environmental
impact. At the same time, however, our assessment also reveals that the material criticality
and negative environmental impacts of lanthanum (La) is of concern for both perovskites. Our
study highlights the necessity and chances to define and quantify sustainability parameters in
early stages of energy material research.

2. Methodology for a sustainability evaluation of energy materials
Figure 2 displays the aspects of a sustainable evaluation of materials which are relevant for
electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries 23. These sustainability evaluation concepts comprise
material criticality, economic, environmental and social impacts, as well as material recycling
and technical performance. As in the early stages of material research the know-how and
implementation of such sustainability parameters is not common practice23,24,26, we briefly
introduce the aspects shown in Figure 2 and introduce which methods can be used in
sustainability evaluations to analyze and quantify the different parameters. Each aspect
contains a section on the methodology that was used in our case study for the evaluation of

La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ electrocatalysts, as summarized in Figure 2b. For the case
study, we first obtain the OER catalytic activity of La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) to define the underlying base for the sustainability evaluation. Then we
elaborate potential industrial synthesis routes to find common precursor materials that can be
used for the fabrication of La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ on large scale. Based on the
catalytic activity and identification of the catalyst precursor materials, we determine the
different sustainability parameters.

electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries with the example of OER catalysts in AWE. b) methods and
resources used in the case study for the sustainability evaluation

2.1 Material criticality

It is estimated that sufficiently large material resources exist for most of the currently used
energy materials that are required for the full energy transition 2,3,53–55. As resources are in
definition economically viable extractable minerals today or in the closer future 56, it implies
that the minerals earth abundance is high enough for the energy transition. However, despite
the existence of sufficiently large resources, the current extraction rates and market supplies
of some crucial materials are predicted to be too low to meet the extraordinarily increasing
demand in material supply for the energy transition and other industries in the near
future2,3,53–55. Hence, the material supply for the energy transition depends on the expansion

of the mining industry and reliable supply chains within a network of geopolitical
interdependencies, rather than on the general abundance of elements in the Earth's crust as
a purely geological concept. Reviewing the current extraction and production rates57 also in
dependence of the depletion of known reserves49 might give an overview of possible shortterm material shortages, but neglects for example low supply chain diversifications, political
instabilities of supplying countries, import reliance on other countries, export prohibitions,
material recycling rates, or possible material substitution options in applications12,27,49.
To evaluate these aspects, so-called material criticality assessments are used. The strongest
economies USA 27,58, China59, the EU12 and Japan 60 periodically conduct criticality assessments
for raw materials61 to estimate material supply risks in their economy and to assess which
impact a potential material shortage can have on their industrial sectors. For example, the
critical raw material assessment published by the European Commission is based on the
quantification of the EU material supply risk and economic importance in the most relevant
industrial sectors 28. Above a certain threshold of both parameters, the material is defined as
critical12. Because material criticality is a quantified and periodically updated parameter from
the governmental institutions, the material criticality can serve as an instructive input to
compare possible material shortages for energy materials in the early stages of energy material
research 26.
In this work, the European Commission’s critical raw material methodology (EC-CRM 202312)
was chosen to compare the material criticality based on the economic importance and supply
risk of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ raw materials. It should be noted that the EC-CRM
2023 method is not a forecasting tool but uses recent data in its current CRM report 12. The
economic importance of a raw material is determined by the share of an end-use application’s
value added to the EU economy. It is reduced when the material in question can be substituted
by another raw material in the end-application. The supply risk is calculated from the supplying
country concentration weighted with the world governance indicators and also weighted with
the import reliance of the EU. The supply risk is reduced by the end-of-life recycling input rate
(EOL-RIR) and is also reduced when the raw material can be substituted by other materials in
an end-application. The underlying calculations for the economic importance and the supply
risk are shown and explained in detail in the supporting information (SI) supplementary note
N1 and were taken from ref. 28. Moreover, we projected the possible demand of perovskite

oxide precursors in AWE (based on our experimental results) in 2050 to estimate if supply
bottle necks might occur for the EU economy.

2.2 Economic parameters
To predict the possible profitability of, for example, batteries, fuel cells or electrolyzers
including their required materials, the investment and operational costs need to be related to
the final market price. To calculate the full costs typically the CapEx (Capital Expenditure) and
OpEx (Operational Expenditure) method are used 23,62,63. To render the full life cycle costs of a
technology the life cycle costing (LCC) method is a strong tool that can also include externalized
costs of environmental impacts23,64.
During early-stage material research, the projected industrial CapEx and OpEx as well as
market price are hardly known. However, there are possible options to estimate different costs.
For example, the price of necessary precursor materials or the energy costs for material
fabrication can be estimated if the (scalable) production process is projected.
In this work, we employ the precursor prices determined for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and
La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ to identify possible differences in economic impact. For precursor materials
that are traded globally and have global market prices, the prices were taken from the institute
of rare earth elements and strategic metals (ISE - Institut für Seltene Erden und Metalle) (see
price details in SI Table T1 including the access date). For domestically traded precursor
materials, price estimates were taken or requested from German suppliers (SI Table T1). A
cumulative price of the precursor materials for 1 kg of stoichiometric La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3 and
La0.6Ca0.4FeO3 was calculated based on the required masses of the precursors shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Required precursor masses for 1 kg perovskite. The molar content of 1 kg perovskite
was calculated for LSCO (4.4 mol) and LCFO (4.9 mol). Required stoichiometric amounts for
each cation were calculated accordingly and related to the required mass of the precursor
material. The oxygen content was not stoichiometrically balanced here, as it originates from
precursor anions such as the nitrates or acetates in the later stage of fabrication as well as
from oxygen in the air in the calcination step.

2.3 Environmental parameters
Despite being envisioned as environment-friendly technologies, the production, operation and
end-of-life of electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries can have severe impact on the environment,
particularly given the high material demand 53. Therefore, the minimization of environmental
impacts must be considered over the entire life cycle of the technologies 2. Especially, the
mining and processing industries are extremely energy and resource-intensive and largely
influence the environment 65. For example, up to 2000 m3 of water are required to extract one
ton of Co metal, which even increases up to 1.2 Mio m3 of water for Pt group metals66. Besides
potential water scarcities, other factors such as high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
extensive land transformation, and toxification are crucial factors that are for example
endangering living space, biodiversity and agricultural land 66. LCA, which is implemented in
well-defined ISO standards 67, quantifies and evaluates such environmental impacts68. A
description of the major steps in the LCA methodology can be found in the SI note N2 and in
the references 69,70.
In this paper, we identified the environmental impacts of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ
precursors serving as catalysts at the anode of AWE based on a LCA approach. The

environmental impacts were conducted with the ecologic footprint method (EF) 3.1 that is
recommended by the European Commission 69,70. The impact categories evaluated here are
climate change, water use, land use, acidification, human ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity,
eutrophication marine and freshwater, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation and
ionizing radiation. Table 2 shows the impact category indicators and units of the evaluated
categories.
Further, we determined the so-called “functional unit” (FU) that is important for an
appropriate comparison of different products or techniques by LCA. In this study, 1 kg catalyst
load of the two perovskites serves as FU because both perovskites show comparable catalytic
mass activity and hence, produce comparable amounts of oxygen (and hydrogen) gas. As
detailed in section 3.1, the mass activity was determined by CV.
The environmental impacts were taken from the ecoinvent3.9 database, based on the
precursor masses in Table 1. The datasets used for the different precursors can be found in the
SI Table T2.

If the technical performance is significantly different, the required material mass can be scaled
(via e.g. a larger geometric surface area) to achieve similar hydrogen outcomes. This
automatically leads to a higher material consumption for the catalyst with smaller mass
activity71.

2.4 Social parameters
Energy material supply chains are recently intensively discussed regarding their social impact
especially on workers and local communities of raw material extraction 21,72. For those cases,
the UN has published human right guidelines for enterprises and governments 73 (implemented
in the social responsibility standard SA8000), tracking child labor, forced work, health and
safety, discrimination of employees and much more 74,75. Moreover, the EU just recently passed
the law for social responsibility throughout the whole supply chain 76. For energy materials
such as noble metals or transition metals the often-mentioned hazardous conditions in
artisanal mining are criticized 72. The hazardous working conditions are even more dramatic
when child labor is involved 21.
Qualitative and (semi-)quantitative tools for a social life cycle assessment (sLCA) have been
developed 77,78 and applied to energy technologies 79–81. However, social impact assessment
methodologies have a lower stage of maturity than environmental LCA78. Typically, sLCA
requires extensive data collection, often inaccessible on the level of early-stage research.
Hence, this study considers existing literature for a qualitative identification of hazardous
working conditions and the existence of child labor for the raw material extraction of the
precursors for La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ.

2.5 Material recycling
Recycling and substitution of critical materials are risk minimizing factors as they directly
reduce the dependency of the raw material supplying countries and companies12,82. This is
reflected in the calculation of the supply risk in the EC-CRM 202312. However, today’s recycling
rates and secondary material usage are relatively low for many relevant materials 12,82. For
example, the “End-of-life Recycling Input Rate” (EOL-RIR)82 of the platinum group metals and
the rare earth metals is only 12 % and 1%, respectively12. In this paper, the current EOL-RIR
was considered as a separate indicator to identify if sufficient secondary material supply exists
for the relevant precursor materials of La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ. Then, we assess if

the available recycled materials are suitable for the projected perovskite synthesis. Based on
this, recycled precursor materials are considered for the sustainability evaluation.

2.6 Technical performance
In early-stage energy material research, the focus typically lies on the understanding of
physical and chemical structure-property-relations to reveal new material design rules that can
lead to higher application performances. The material composition, efficiency and durability
can improve the sustainability of the technology’s whole life cycle, as the economic,
environmental, and social impacts directly scale with the required material consumption.
On the one hand, early-stage materials research is often based on model systems that depart
from the real geometry in the final application, leaving significant room for improvements by
engineering of the final assembly. On the other hand, such model systems have the advantage
to facilitate a systematic chemical and physical analysis of the materials of interest and at the
same time allow a precise comparison of a broad range of materials. In this paper, we compare
the OER catalytic mass activity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ thin films that have the
advantage of providing comparable surface morphologies facilitating the observation of
intrinsic catalytic properties.
3. Case study: La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ catalysts in alkaline water electrolysis
3.1 Catalytic activity results of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ thin films
To compare the intrinsic catalytic activity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ in the OER, we
deposited 20 nm thick catalyst layers by pulsed laser deposition to achieve comparable surface
morphologies that have a route mean square roughness of 3-5nm (see atomic force
microscopy scans in the SI Figure S1a). A comparable surface morphology facilitates obtaining
the intrinsic catalytic activity decoupled from larger surface area differences typically
appearing with powder synthesis routes 52. The crystallographic characterization of the thin
film stack can be found in the SI Figure S2. A platinized Si substrate was chosen as current
collector to avoid contact resistances (see sample stack in Figure 3a; 5 nm Ti were used as
adhesive interlayer). Note that the Pt layer itself has a much lower OER activity than perovskite
catalysts83, so that it serves merely as electrical contact and does not contribute to the intrinsic
activities of our model perovskites. Moreover, the Pt layer is fully buried underneath the
perovskite layer as demonstrated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements

presented in the SI Figure S1c, so that any contribution of the Pt layer to the observed OER
activity can be excluded.
To relate the OER intrinsic activity to the catalyst mass load (i.e., to determine the mass
activity), CV was conducted. We determined the OER activity of La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and
La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ perovskite oxide thin films in a rotating disk electrode setup in a 3-electrode
configuration. Figure 3a shows representative averaged CV scans obtained for the two thin
films. Both perovskites exhibit comparable OER mass activity reaching about 0.75 mA/µg at an
anode voltage of 1.76 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). The standard deviation of the
CV potentials is 9-11 mV for La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ and 20-25 mV for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and is calculated
from three different samples of each perovskite. It was determined at three different currents
along the CV scan at 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8 mA/µg (the standard deviation differences of 9-11 mV
and 20-25 mV stem from these three different points).
As shown in Figure 3b, the total charge converted during the CV scan per µg catalyst is
comparable for both catalysts, with a slightly larger value obtained for La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ. The
standard deviation of the charge per µg was calculated from three different samples of each
perovskite. Hence, a similar amount of oxygen and respectively hydrogen were produced,
implying a comparable performance of both materials for their envisioned application as OER
catalysts. Both samples were exposed to the electrolyte with the same geometric surface area,
where double layer capacitance measurements showed consistent capacitance values for
both, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ (SI Figure S1b).
While these lab-based rotating disk electrode measurements are ideal for determining relative
catalytic activity, they are less ideal for the determination of the catalyst stability in a final
application scenario 84,85. Particularly, degradation rate and lifetime depend on the system
integration of the catalyst layers; enhanced lifetimes were reported for integrated catalysts in
membrane-electrode assemblies compared to RDE experiments 84,85. While these studies
confirmed that accurate stability tests under industrial conditions are inaccessible using a
model-system approach and testing setup, various model-system studies of these and similar
compounds have shown that very thin layers of perovskite oxides are sufficiently stable to
serve as model systems to assess and compare activity trends 33,86,87.
Therefore, we rely on the intrinsic activity comparison as a starting point for a comprehensive
material evaluation in early-stage catalyst research. The similar mass activity and generated
charge in one CV cycle suggests that comparable amounts of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and

La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ catalysts may be projected for the final electrolyzer assembly to achieve
similarly efficient hydrogen production. We hence elaborate economic and environmental
aspects based on the FU of 1 kg perovskite.

La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ thin films. Anodic and cathodic scans were averaged to remove capacitive
current contributions. b) Charge per µg catalyst passed in one CV cycle. A comparable charge

3.2 Projected synthesis routes of perovskites on large area electrodes
While the determination of the intrinsic catalytic activity of the selected materials is done
ideally on laboratory- and model-system level, a quantification of the projected sustainability
parameters must consider the projected industrial-scale production route. Perovskite oxides
for industrial applications are typically synthesized via solid-state or wet-synthesis
methods39,88. Since the solid-state route is more susceptible to impurities, requires higher
reaction temperatures, and typically forms larger particles which is coupled to a lower specific
surface area39,88, we consider the wet chemical methods to achieve high-purity nanoparticles
for a potential industrial perovskite oxide synthesis. Note that identified precursors are also
suitable for the solid-state route besides Fe scrap as that would have to be converted to iron
oxide first89.

In Figure 4, the projected synthesis routes for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ are shown,
starting from the raw material input to the finally coated electrode for AWE. In this scenario,
La, Sr, and Co containing rocks are extracted and further processed to La 2O3, SrCO3, and Co 3O4.
For the La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ production La and Ca containing rocks are extracted from mines and
processed to La2O3 and CaCO3. In contrast, Fe can be used from iron scrap, since high amounts
of iron scrap are available on the scrap market. The iron scrap can be directly converted to iron
nitrate90 or another organic metal salt, and hence generally bypass the mining process. Note
that not all scrap types are applicable. Here, an alloy free91 and new iron scrap can be chosen
and potentially be used for the perovskite oxide synthesis. More details about the option to
use recycled materials can be found in the material recycling section below.
In the subsequent production step, the precursor materials are dissolved in acidic solution to
form metal nitrates or other metal-organic acid salts. Stoichiometric amounts of the precursor
solutions are then mixed, combined with additives and calcined to arrive at fine nanoparticle
perovskite powders. The nanoparticles are then deposited on large-area metal electrodes via
for example screen printing92,93, jet printing, tape casting, or electrochemical deposition
(Figure 4 bottom)39,89,94.

The latter process steps to arrive at the functional nanoparticles are typically quite similar for
the perovskite family, and La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ in particular95,96. Therefore, for
a direct comparison of the two perovskites, we can focus on the production of the precursor
materials La 2O3, SrCO3, CaCO3, Co3O4 and iron scrap (marked in Figure 4 with the box
“precursor fabrication”). The subsequent common process steps will similarly add to the full
sustainability evaluation, e.g. through the calcination step which requires a high energy input
but can be regarded similar for both materials under test. In the following, the material
criticality, raw material prices, as well as environmental and social impacts resulting from the
precursor masses for 1 kg perovskite (see Table 1) are discussed with a focus on the precursor
materials.

3.3 Sustainability evaluation results
3.3.1 Material criticality
In the current EC-CRM 2023 assessment, a material is considered critical when the supply risk
(SR) parameter exceeds a value of 1 and the economic importance (EI) parameter exceeds a
value of 2.8 (shaded area in Figure 5)12,28. As shown, Sr, Co and lanthanum (La) are hence
considered as critical in the 2023 EU assessment whereas limestone (the major source for
Calcium (Ca)) and iron (Fe) ore are considered as non-critical. Both, limestone and Fe ore have
a high economic importance for the EU, but the supply risk is low because of a high
diversification level of supplying countries inside and outside the EU 12.
Sr is evaluated as critical, primarily because it is essential to produce magnets and pyrotechnics
and has only one EU supplying country (Spain). It is hence affected by both a high economic
importance as well as a high supply risk. Co is evaluated as critical primarily because its supply
is poorly diversified, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (with 63 % the main global Co
supplier) is suffering from high political instability. Furthermore, Co is essential to produce
several alloys and hard materials that add high value to the EU economy. La is critical due to a
high supply risk of 3.5 and a high economic importance of 2.9. This is because 85 % of the
global La supply is coming from China where La is extracted as well as processed. Since La is
not recycled and not easily substituted in relevant applications, the EU relies to a large extent
on La import from China. La mainly adds value to the EU economy as component in fluid
cracking catalysts and other catalysts12. While the depletion of known La reserves is projected
17

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ft8zt ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0207-7840 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

to occur within the next 100-500 years49, the high geopolitical dependencies and low supply
chain diversification for La supply can be a significant supply risk in the closer future.
Based on this evaluation, exchanging Sr and Co for Ca and Fe can reduce the overall material
criticality of our model catalysts. However, La is of immediate concern for both perovskites
regarding its high supply risk.

La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ adapted from 12. Ca* is limestone and Fe the iron ore 12.
Projected increase in demand for perovskite oxides in the EU based on experimental results
To estimate how many tons of perovskite would be required for AWE in a gigawatt scale in the
EU in the future, we calculated the power-to-mass ratio based on our model systems and
compared it to an estimated hydrogen demand scenario in 2050 based on ref. 97. With that, it
can be estimated if some of the perovskite precursors would require larger supply chain
expansions than others in comparison to today’s EU material consumption.
Here, we calculated the mass-to-power ratio at 1.76 V vs RHE with an output of 0.75 mA/µg.
At this operating voltage the required perovskite mass-to-power ratio is around 0.76 t/GW
under the assumption that the perovskite catalysts form dense 20 nm thick layers on
commercial electrode surfaces and are operated in 0.1 M KOH solution at room temperature
(as according to our experiments). Note that AWE electrolyzers are typically operated in 510 M KOH solution at 40-85°C8,98,99. Hence, the industrial operating conditions have an
influence on the final mass-to-power ratio of the perovskites as well as the operational catalyst
18

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ft8zt ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0207-7840 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

lifetimes. However, this calculated mass-to-power ratio is comparable to the estimate of Ir
catalyst ratio which is 0.75 t/GW in acidic proton exchange membrane electrolysis 30. The
comparability of catalyst loads in AWE is hard because Ni as the main catalyst material is also
applied as substrate and as bipolar plates material 30.
To upscale the power-to-mass ratio to the forecasted EU hydrogen consumption in 2050 it is
estimated that 429 GW of AWE power is required in a high demand scenario (HDS)
(calculations found in SI table T397). To cover this demand the here investigated perovskite
catalyst layers would sum up to around 325 t perovskite. As not all AWE plants will be operated
with perovskite oxides, this number is an upper limit for the experimental results. Such
perovskite catalyst loads in AWE correspond to 5-6 % of the recent, annual EU lanthanum
consumption 100, 0.8 % of the average EU Co consumption 101 whereas the other elements Sr,
Ca and Fe fall below the average EU consumption of 0.1 % 102–104(see for details of the EU
material consumption SI table T3).
As we chose here thin film catalysts that have comparably smooth surface morphologies to
obtain a fair comparison of the catalytic performance, final mass-to-power ratio may be
further optimized and influenced by material morphology engineering, catalyst integration,
and by the application of industrial operation conditions. However, an estimate of possible
material consumption gives an overview of possible supply bottle necks. The relatively larger
supply chain expansion of La compared to the other precursors as well as lanthanum’s high
material criticality might hence lead to a threat for the application of both perovskites.
3.3.2 Economic impact based on precursor prices
The market prices of the required precursor materials reflect a direct indicator of the economic
impacts in the materials selection. Figure 6 shows the cumulative precursor price per kg
perovskite for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ. Detailed price information and sources are
summarized in SI Table T3. The cumulative precursor price for 1 kg perovskite is about 10 times
lower for La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ compared to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ. For La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ the cumulative price
is dominated by Co 3O4 while La2O3 and SrCO3 share only ~10 % of the precursor costs. For
La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ, the iron substitution reduces the cumulative price by a factor of 10, where
iron scrap makes up only 15 % of the projected La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ price. The rest of the
cumulative price is shared by La2O3 and CaCO3 with 57 % and 27 %, respectively.

3.3.3 Environmental impacts of precursor production
Figure 7 shows the environmental impact results of the precursor materials for 1 kg perovskite
oxide for the categories climate change, water use, land use, acidification potential, human
toxicity and ecotoxicity. Further impact category results on eutrophication, photochemical
ozone formation, ozone depletion and ionizing radiation are shown in the SI Figure S3. Detailed
definitions of the single impact categories can be found in ref. 70.
For all environmental impact categories from Figure 7 and Figure S3, the use of Fe from scrap
instead of Co from Co 3O4 for the perovskite oxide B-site significantly decreases the
environmental impact, particularly for the categories climate change, water use, acidification
potential, and human toxicity. In contrast, SrCO3 and CaCO3 precursors both have almost no
environmental impact in all categories. For La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ, the La2O3 production dominates in
all impact categories by at least 90 %. Also, for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, the La2O3 production makes up
at least 75 % of the environmental impact in the four categories land use, ecotoxicity
freshwater, marine eutrophication, and ozone depletion, indicating that the use of La in both
catalysts implies severe environmental burdens.

3.3.4 Social aspects
A quantitative analysis of the social impacts is elusive on the level of early-stage research.
However, we highlight some key aspects that can yield a preliminary assessment of the
expected social impacts of raw material extraction.
With respect to the Co mining industry, social impact assessments exist mainly for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, as main supplier of Co. While there are regulated working
standards for artisanal mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many mining sites do
not follow those rules and many artisanal miners do not have the knowledge about these
regulations. Hence, mining tunnels are exceeding the allowed tunnel length, and several safety
constructions are often not installed 105. Although child labor is also regulated in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, 29 % of the miners were children in 2011, reflecting the
high poverty in the country105. In contrast, the use of iron scrap is generally acknowledged to
have a positive social impact as, for example, the use of iron scrap reduces climate change
related socio-economic costs globally, as it reduces CO2 pollution 106.

The assessment of social impacts in the La industry is less mature107. However, it is reported
that the rare earth industry in China causes health problems for the directly involved
stakeholders such as increased exposure to radioactive tailings 107–111. Moreover, it is stated
that the environmental burdens of rare earth material processing are so high that it is hard to
get a permission for rare earth processing sites in developed countries107. Therefore, rare earth
material processing takes mainly place in less developed countries 107.
In contrast, with Spain as a major supplier for Sr in the European Union102, child labor and
hazardous working conditions are regulated and can be considered as negligible in the
European Union. Likewise, Ca is also locally sourced in Europe 103 and to our knowledge no child
labor or hazardous working conditions are reported.

3.3.5 Material recycling
Environmental, economic, and social impacts as well as the material criticality, can be
potentially improved if recycling rates increase and accessible secondary material supply is
provided, especially in the case of La and Co, which were found to have the largest economic
and environmental impacts.
Today, the EOL-RIR of Co is already around 22 %12. However, the recycled Co is to a large extent
embedded in Co-alloys and therefore not directly accessible for Co 3O4 recovery112. The use of
recycled Co from battery cathodes would potentially be suitable for the perovskite production,
but competes with the battery market itself 113,114. Therefore, our case study is based on the
primary (non-recycled) material supply for Co3O4.
In contrast, Fe has a high recycling rate (EOL-RIR 31 %12) and certain scraps are suitable for the
precursor production. Fe scrap can be domestically available and Fe scrap contributes to the
comparably low Fe market prices and the lowered environmental and social impacts.
The EOL-RIR of La is only 1 %12, and hence, for the perovskite production not applicable at this
stage. The same holds for limestone with an EOL-RIR < 1 %12 . However, as Ca is a non-critical
material and CaCO3 production from primary sources has a low environmental impact, the
need for increased recycling rates is of lower priority. The Sr EOL-RIR is nearly zero12 and hence
not considerable for secondary material input today. Given the material criticality of Sr, Co and
La, efficient recycling may reflect a future strategy to mediate the high supply risk for the
primary material supply.

4. Discussion
All analyzed sustainability parameters of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ OER catalysts are
summarized and compared in Table 3. While the two perovskites exhibit a comparable
technical performance in our laboratory-based experiments, several sustainability parameters
of La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ have a lower impact compared to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (marked in green/red color
in Table 3). This includes that the supply risk of Ca and Fe is low compared to Sr and Co.
Moreover, the projected price of La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ is 90 % lower than for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ because
Co is avoided. The environmental impact of La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ is at least 25 % lower compared to
La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ in those categories, where cobalt oxide production is having a significant
impact. However, in the environmental impact categories that are dominated by La 2O3
production, both La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ have similarly high environmental impact
(marked in black). La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ has potentially a lower social impact than La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ
because Co mining often involves child labor and can occur under hazardous working
conditions. Nevertheless, La processing can also occur under hazardous working conditions
which is a disadvantage for both.
In summary, the exchange of Co to Fe may hence be assessed as generally beneficial for the
majority of sustainability parameters. Similarly, the exchange of Sr by Ca further reduces the
overall supply risk of the perovskite. Nevertheless, the presence of La yields a significant
challenge for the catalyst usage in larger scales for both perovskites and has to be addressed
in the future.

Our analysis emphasizes that material sustainability evaluation in early-stage research can
provide additional criteria for materials selection next to physical and chemical
performances23. These criteria might act as an additional driver to test and to optimize
materials that have a lower supply risk as well as lower economic, environmental and social
impacts in their final application 23,24,26. If the results of the sustainability evaluation are not as
clear as in this case study (a clearly preferred perovskite), multi-criteria decision analysis
(MCDA) can be used to structure decision-making processes. MCDA includes mathematical
approaches to cluster many individual results into fewer but more manageable results 115.
At the same time, our case study revealed both the chances and limitations as well as required
assumptions to arrive at a quantitative sustainability evaluation. Model catalysts, as employed
in this study, are ideal for determining intrinsic catalytic activity as they have comparable
surface morphologies and are independent of additional stack assembly related resistances.
24

Hence, for the comparison of two materials that are supposed to serve the same function
(here the anode electrocatalysts in AWE), the model catalysts can be quantitatively related to
sustainability parameters via their mass activity. However, the scaling to industrial applications
is limited, as for example lifetimes and loadings of final electrolyzer stacks are hard to predict
which is indispensable to project and approximate the final electrolyzer production and
operation impact. Nevertheless, a first evaluation can be made with the model system
approach if the assumptions and conditions are well-defined. This can be the basis for material
choices in later stages of material research.
Testing a broad field of materials with catalyst model systems in early-stage research can be
the general basis for a material preselection in applied research of energy materials.
Implementing a sustainability evaluation already at early stages of material research can be a
strong opportunity to identify less sustainable material compositions, and potentially refocus
the research. As found in this study, reducing the La content or even eliminating it could
improve the sustainability of the material even more as compared to the sole exchange of Co
and Sr to Fe and Ca. However, the replacement of La has to be tested for OER catalyst
performance to make a further decision on the necessity of La containing perovskite catalysts.
One option could be to replace La fully with Ca on the A-site where some recent studies show
that CaCoO3 116or CaFeO3 51 show high catalytic activity. Nonetheless, it was also reported that
the usage of only alkaline earth elements on the A-site might lead to a faster structural
transformation 47,48. Another option could be to replace La by other rare earth elements such
as dysprosium or neodymium but these are also critical raw materials 12 and do not have a
lower environmental impact117,118. Hence, they are not necessarily suitable for a La exchange.
In further feedback loops, the sustainability of energy materials can be evaluated both in
applied research (e.g., testing the catalyst in an actual electrolyzer stack) as well as in industrial
research (e.g., long term tests under industrial conditions) (Figure 8). The latter includes the
development of a sustainable material design strategy for final scaling parameters and longterm technical performance. Such a feedback loop between energy material research and
sustainability evaluation would be beneficial at all stages of research to constantly reevaluate
and leverage the sustainability of material-intensive technologies.

5. Conclusion
We showcased to which extent a sustainability evaluation can be conducted for model OER
catalysts in early-stage research. First, as we elaborated, quantifying and comparing possible
material shortages for a future-oriented materials selection, criticality assessments can be a
stronger indicator than mere ‘earth abundance’ maps that are solely geological perspectives.
Material criticality assessments such as from the European Commission determine raw
materials supply risks by also quantifying their geopolitical interdependencies which is crucial
for sufficient material supply for the energy transition.
Furthermore, economic and environmental parameters can already be related to the mass
activity of model catalysts in the lab-scale based on projected industrial synthesis routes.
Environmental impact categories considered in LCA can be assigned to the precursor materials
of the energy material and can be weighted according to their expected performance. Also,
social impacts can be considered on a qualitative scale to identify if, for example, hazardous
working conditions exist in raw material extraction. Moreover, secondary material input from
recycling presents an attractive parameter if sufficient supply is offered on the commodity
market and if the secondary material can be used for precursor production. Also, estimates of
potential future demands of the investigated materials in a forecasted green energy economy
(e.g., in the year 2050) can be compared to current material consumption to get an overview
which materials might challenge the expansion of the supply chain more than others.

Based on such analysis, materials of high concern can be exchanged or avoided, or material
design strategies can be refocused already in early stages of energy material research. Our
case study demonstrates that an efficient feedback loop between materials research experts
and sustainability experts can pave the way for new and sustainable energy material design.
Balancing sustainability and technical performance at all stages of energy material research
might benefit the energy transition.
While it remains of utmost importance not to generally restrict the elemental choices in
fundamental materials research and to explore unknown properties and phenomena
independent of industrial scenarios, the early-stage consideration of sustainability aspects
reflects an efficient opportunity to improve existing technologies in a holistic and sustainable
manner. As the energy transition requires massive material consumption, and an established
hydrogen economy is only one branch of it, early-stage material research with less critical
materials, higher recycling rates, lower environmental, social and economic impact can drive
a successful and especially feasible energy transition.
6. Experimental methods
Thin film fabrication: The thin films of La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ were fabricated with
pulsed laser deposition (TSST, B.V., Netherlands) from ceramic targets provided by Toshima
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Japan). For the perovskite oxide growth, an oxygen partial pressure
of 0.05 mbar, deposition temperature of 650 °C and a laser energy of 2.2 J/cm2 (La0.6Ca0.4FeO3δ)

and 2.6 J/cm2 (La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ) of a KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm) were applied.

10x10 mm2 single crystalline silicon substrates (from Siegert Wafer, Germany) were sputtered
(Univex sputter tool, SIEMENS, Germany) with a 5 nm Titanium adhesive layer for the
subsequent Pt sputter deposition of 50 nm. The platinized silicon substrate was used to ensure
metallic contact.
Thin film characterization: The surface morphology was determined with an atomic force
microscope (Cypher SPM, Oxford Instruments, Research Asylum, Germany) in the tapping
mode. The silicon tips were provided by NanoWorld AG (Switzerland) with a force constant of
42 N/m and a mean width of 30 µm. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction was conducted with a
D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) that is equipped with a
Cu anode as Kα x-ray source.
Electrochemical characterization: Electrochemical measurements were conducted in with a
rotating disk electrode setup (Pine Research Instrumentation, Inc, USA) at a rotation speed of

samples were placed in a customized PEEK cap on the RDE rotation shaft and sealed towards
the electrolyte with an O-ring (diameter of 0.75 mm) so that a defined surface area was
exposed to the electrolyte. The electrolyte concentration was 0.1 M KOH made from KOH
pellets provided by Sigma Aldrich (99.9 %) and deionized water (Milli-Q, >18.2 M Ω cm). Before
the start of the measurement, the electrolyte was purged with oxygen for 30 min. Double layer
capacitance measurements were conducted for La 0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ from 0.1-0.2 V vs Hg/HgO and
for La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ from 0.2-0.3 V with increasing sweep rates from 10 mV/s to 500 mV/s. CV
scans were conducted between 0.2 V-1.15 vs Hg/HgO. The CV scan was averaged from the
back and forward sweep in the OER potential regime. To transfer the values to the RHE scale
we measured the electrode potential between an RHE (HydroFlex, USA) and the Hg/HgO
electrode in the electrolyte. The potential scale of the CV scans was iR corrected, where the
uncompensated resistance was determined by the x-axis offset in the high frequency range of
a PEIS measurement (20k-0.1 Hz with 20 mV amplitude) at open circuit potential.
