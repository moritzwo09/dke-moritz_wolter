Abstract

13

Acidic pollutants have long been known to have detrimental impacts on remote ecosystems and

14

subject to assessment through long-term monitoring with low cost methodologies, such as passive

15

sampling. Atmospheric oxidation is becoming recognized as a source of novel persistent

16

perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) derived from volatile poly- and perfluorinated alkyl

17

substance (PFAS) precursors. In this work, nylon substrate passive air samplers that are selective for

18

atmospheric acids are described and verified through extensive quality assurance and control tests,

including controlled chamber tests for sampling rates. The sampling rate for gaseous trifluoroacetic

20

acid (TFA; C2) was established experimentally, with ultra-trace detection limits at parts per

21

quadrillion by volume mixing ratios (ppqv; 10-15 mol mol-1) demonstrated for a one week sampling

22

period. Sampling rates for the C3-C6 homologues of the PFCA family were derived from two

23

diffusion theories of varying complexity. Proof-of-concept measurements were performed at urban,

24

rural continental, and remote marine sites in Canada for over a year. All PFCA homologues from C2-

25

C6 were detected above the method detection limits, with abundance decreasing with increasing chain

26

length and from urban to rural to remote locations. Atmospheric abundance was dominated by TFA,

27

which also showed trends consistent with known sources of precursors and atmospheric oxidation

28

chemistry. This new PFCA-specific passive air sampling method represents a promising new option

29

for the study of PFCA formation, transport, and fate in the atmosphere.

Environmental significance statement

32

Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) are persistent and mobile in aquatic systems. The production

33

and global dispersion of these molecules is understudied in the atmosphere due to the lack of validated

34

sampling techniques that can be widely deployed. A robust and cost-effective passive air sampling

35

technique was developed to measure the distribution of gaseous atmospheric PFCAs at three locations

36

across Canada over a year, with trifluoroacetic acid the most abundant and showing summer

37

enhancement due to known precursor emissions and atmospheric chemistry.

41

Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), a sub-class and terminal degradation product of per-

42

and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are pollutants in the environment that are known to be

43

persistent due to their strong carbon-fluorine bonds. Unique properties of PFAS, such as their

44

hydrophobicity, lipophobicity, thermal stability, and resistance to various chemical agents, has

45

resulted in their production for use in a variety of commercial products. 1 As a consequence, PFCAs

46

are found in the environment from direct emissions through their use as processing aids 2,3 and from

47

indirect degradation reactions of precursor PFAS.4,5

48

PFCAs have been found ubiquitously in the global environment, even though they are not

49

naturally occurring.6–8 Their chemical stability prevents their degradation under typical environmental

50

conditions and arguments have been made that PFCAs have exceeded their planetary boundary. 9,10

51

Atmospheric formation of PFCAs is recognized as an important pathway for global

52

contamination.5,11–13 The atmospheric abundance of PFCAs and their drivers over long temporal and

53

wide spatial scales are of high importance and demand accurate atmospheric measurements through

54

targeted methods that can be easily adopted by the global community of researchers. 14,15

55

Passive air samplers (PAS) have been employed by scientists and air quality analysts for many

56

years to provide an inexpensive and power-free sampling method. 16,17 These features make them

57

suitable for challenging deployments, including in remote areas, and in large numbers to capture

58

spatial scale changes in environmental concentrations, albeit at days to months temporal resolution.

59

The functional principle of PAS is to retain the analytes of interest by sorbing them onto a collection

60

medium,16 which occurs either due to the analytes preferentially partitioning into it, on to it, or

61

facilitated more selectively by a reactive uptake process.16,18

62

A few studies have explored the use of PAS for sampling PFCAs with polyurethane foam

63

disks (PUF), different types of porous divinylbenzene and polystyrene resin (XAD), or a combination
3

64

of both.19,20 The sorption of PFCAs onto PUF has generally been found to be low, reaching

65

partitioning equilibrium for most compounds after just one day. 20 Although the addition of XAD

66

embedded resin improves performance by approximately two orders of magnitude, several challenges

67

remain.20 A linear sampling uptake was only observed over a few weeks, limiting usefulness for

68

sampling at monthly to annual timescales.20 Additionally, the PUF or PUF-XAD combination

69

required extensive sample preparation involving hours of continuous Soxhlet extraction from the PUF

70

and XAD using solvents, followed by further time for concentrating the extract using rotary

71

evaporation.21 Furthermore, method development of PAS has not considered the emerging importance

72

of ultra-short-chain PFCAs, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA),

73

which are known to be present in atmospheric and deposition samples at much higher levels than

74

PFCAs with 4 carbon atoms or more (≥C4).21–25 Thus, increasing needs are being communicated by

75

the scientific community for a different type of passive air sampler and analysis method(s) to address

76

these challenges. An attractive avenue worth considering is one which takes advantage of the acidic

77

properties of PFCAs which have not been selectively targeted by passive air sampling methods to

78

date.

79

Nylon-based PAS have been established as effective collectors of abundant through ultra-trace

80

quantities of atmospheric acids. The suitability of nylon, a polyamide material, as a collecting medium

81

for atmospheric acids dates back to the 1980s when it was found to efficiently and quantitatively

82

collect acids such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid (HNO3).26,27 Since then, nylon with highly

83

controlled properties like porosity and thickness has been used as a collection medium in PAS for the

84

collection of gaseous HNO3.17,28–30 Unlike PUF-XAD-based PAS, the extraction procedure for nylon-

85

based PAS is fast and simple and the nylon sorbents have been demonstrated to be reusable. 17,31 The

86

sampling rates of these samplers are also possible to calibrate28 and they have been deployed in remote

87

regions. They were shown to measure gaseous HNO3 at mixing ratios as low as 9 parts per trillion

88

(10-12 mol mol-1, pptv) during a 35-day sampling period, with the potential to detect lower values if

89

deployed longer, demonstrating their ultra-trace capabilities. 17 Considering that gaseous PFCAs

90

would be classed as strong atmospheric acids and are found at ultra-trace levels, these nylon-based

91

PAS present a promising new option for atmospheric monitoring and study of the chemistry and

92

transport of PFCAs. With recent developments in generating known gas phase quantities of PFCAs

93

alongside a chemically selective passive air sampling medium,32,33 more reliable and accurate

94

measurements of their atmospheric abundance should be possible to obtain from direct calibration in

95

atmospheres of known composition. Primary standard calibration is particularly important, as no

96

atmospheric sampling technique for PFCAs has undergone formal validation to date and other

97

measurement approaches rely heavily on method intercomparisons.

98

Calibration of gas-phase samplers can be performed by controlled chamber experiments

99

and/or by orthogonal chemical measurement techniques in the field, where we define orthogonal as

100

independent measurements of a compound using fundamentally different sampling and/or detection

101

techniques. Controlled chamber calibrations of nylon passive samplers have been shown to produce

102

reliable uptake sampling rates (commonly referred to as dose-response rates) for HNO 3. This

103

approach allows a robust calibration across the dynamic range of expected environmental

104

concentrations, whereas field derived rates are heavily dependent on the composition of ambient air.

105

Annular denuders have been used as an orthogonal sampling technique to calibrate nylon-based PAS

106

for gas-phase HNO3, both in the field and using an atmospheric chamber. 17,28 Denuders have also

107

been used to quantify gas-phase PFCAs based on their chemically-explicit selectivity for acids, a

108

property which has been standard practice by monitoring agencies for strong acids for decades, 34 even

109

though they have not yet been fully validated for PFCAs through controlled experiments. 35,36 Despite

110

this, annular denuders are currently the best active sampling option for quantitatively collecting

111

gaseous PFCAs that avoids sampling biases of other commonly used active sampling techniques. 15,35

112

The goal of this work is to validate the use of nylon PAS for PFCAs in the gas phase by

113

calibrating the PAS and validating an extraction method, which are then paired with established

114

quantitative techniques. Spike and recovery, internal standards, and a variety of blanks were evaluated

115

for the PAS analytical method steps were used to ensure efficient extraction and quantitation of

116

PFCAs, and for prevention of contamination bias. A sampling rate calibration was conducted for TFA

117

using an atmospheric chamber with gas mixtures controlled through a permeation device and a zero-

118

air generator. The sampling rate of other PFCAs was predicted by extension from TFA using Graham

119

and Fuller’s Laws for diffusion.17,37 The resulting method provides a validated passive air sampling

120

method for TFA in the gas phase and a reliable framework for application to atmospheric PFCAs with

121

carbon chain lengths up to C6. A suite of PAS was deployed in replicate at urban, semi-urban, and

122

remote Canadian locations that include continental and coastal sites. Deployments of weeks to months

123

were typical, but spans with a total duration of up to a year were possible when detecting C2-C6

124

PFCAs in the remote atmosphere where sites were difficult to access. We show that this technique

125

overcomes many of the current challenges for gas phase PFCA measurements such as selectivity,

126

dynamic range including ultra-trace detection limits, sampling site selection, and maintenance

127

requirements, while also minimizing costs.

137

Sigma Aldrich. Stock solutions of PFCAs for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)

138

analysis were prepared in ethyl acetate (EtAc; HPLC Grade; Anachemia VWR, PA, US) at 500

139

μg/mL, which were diluted to working concentrations (0.5-250 µg/L). Mass-labeled 13C2-TFA

140

(>97%) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals; 13C3-PFBA was purchased as a mixture

141

with other labelled PFCAs in MeOH (2 μg/mL; MPFAC-C-IS) from Wellington Laboratories. These

142

compounds were combined into one MeOH solution and used as internal standards (IS) for GC-MS

143

analysis. Diphenyl diazomethane (DDM; >90%) was synthesized in-house using established

156

The custom-built nylon-based PAS are based on an adaptation from our previous design that

157

was used to measure ultra-trace levels of gaseous HNO3.17 The filter pack sampler assembly (Figure

158

1A) is composed of one nylon membrane filter (47 mm diameter, 0.45 μm pore size, 115 μm thickness,

159

Sartorius, Fisher Scientific, P/N 2500647N), one polypropylene filter (PP; 47 mm diameter, 2.0 μm

160

pore size, 180-250 μm thickness, Tisch Scientific, SKU: SF14908), one petri dish (60 x 15 mm, Fisher

161

Scientific), two polyfluorotetraethylene (PTFE) rings (52 x 2 mm, McMaster Carr, P/N 8547K33),

162

and one polycarbonate ring (53 x 4 mm, McMaster Carr, P/N 8486K541).

163

The PTFE and PP materials were used as inert surfaces to minimize sorption bias and are

164

effectively cleaned between uses by our standard washing procedures. Weatherproof enclosures

165

painted with a reflective silver coating are used to protect the filter pack assembly from atmospheric

166

conditions (e.g. strong winds) that would cause sampling to diverge from a diffusion regime,

167

precipitation interactions which could introduce contaminants and alter the sampling rate. The paint

168

reflects sunlight to reduce temperature differences in the filter pack assembly compared to the ambient

169

air temperature. Atmospheric acids, including PFCAs, ideally sorb onto the nylon filters through an

170

acid-base reaction, with one likely mechanism illustrated in Figure 1B in addition to reaction with

171

any terminal amino groups. The PP filter, a deactivating material, physically blocks particles or other

172

suspended atmospheric contaminants from reaching the nylon.

atmospheric acids to nylon filters, where analogous reactions can take place at terminal amino groups;
(C) diffusion sampling rate (kd) controls on the rate of adsorption (kads) for quantitative collection of

collected on the overlying filter.

180

This PP barrier allows gas molecules, inclusive of acids, to permeate at a constant rate through

181

the material pores (kD; Figure 1C) followed by selective chemisorption of acids. A concentration

182

gradient is thus created between the PP and nylon filters, facilitating continuous diffusion of acids to

183

the nylon substrate. The sampling rate of acid analytes may be reduced by the solubilization (k H) or

184

reactive uptake (kR) of gas-phase acids to the PP filters when water or particulate matter (PM) have

185

been accumulated (Figure 1C).17,28 The PP filter implemented here replaces more expensive PTFE

186

filters previously used, with material selection rationale and experimental validation through ambient

intercomparison provided in the Supporting Information (SI; Section S1). Details on our custom-made

188

passive air sampler standard operating procedures have been revised in this work and follow below.

189

The washing, assembling, and extraction procedures of PAS were adapted from Place et al.,17

190

replacing the PTFE filters with PP filters, to reduce costs. Our cleaning procedures for the sampler

191

materials prevent the fluoropolymers from potentially acting as a source of PFCA contamination

192

through release of residuals.39,40 A cleaning procedure for the PP filters was developed by rinsing 6

193

times in a 1 L PP container with DIW, soaking in DIW for 12 h, rinsing an additional 6 times, and

194

soaking again for a minimum of 12 h. Nylon membrane filters were prepared by rinsing 6 times in a

195

1 L PP container with DIW, soaking for a minimum of 12 h in 0.015 M of Na 2CO3 to displace any

196

bound acid impurities, rinsing another 6 times with DIW, and soaking in DIW again for a minimum

197

of 12 h. Both types of filters were air dried for 2 h between two Kimtech ® Kimwipes on a clean

198

benchtop before being installed into filter pack assemblies with clean gloves and tweezers. The

199

support rings are installed into the petri dishes with the nylon and PP filters tightly secured between

200

them. The PAS are then covered with the lid of the Petrie dish, secured using tape, placed into sealed

201

Ziploc bags, and refrigerated until deployment.

202

At sampling locations, including within the experimental chamber, PAS were removed from

203

the Ziploc bags, separated from the petri dish covers, and secured at the top of the weather shield

204

using hook and loop fastener, as shown in Figures 1A and S1. The weather shields are then hung on

205

a stable structure for the sampling period duration and the filter packs are then removed from the

206

shields during collection in the reverse order. Field blanks are filter pack assemblies transported to

207

the sampling locations, exposed to the surrounding air for 10 seconds by removing the Petri dish

208

cover, which are then re-covered and placed back into the Ziploc bags for extraction alongside the

209

atmospheric passive samples.

210

For extractions, 15 mL Falcon® conical tubes were precleaned with six rinses of DIW and one

211

final rinse with HPLC MeOH. Nylon filters were taken out of the filter pack assemblies with DIW-

212

cleaned tweezers and gently rolled to transfer into the tubes. Extraction conditions were first

213

optimized through spike and recovery experiments, which were conducted at TFA levels of 400 ng

214

with 0-4 mM NaOH at room temperature (22 °C) and 4 °C. The optimal method for TFA (3-4 mM

215

NaOH at either temperature) was then applied to a mixture of 0.5-100 ng of C2-C6 PFCAs, reflective

216

of their relative and absolute abundance, to ensure quantitative recovery across the target analyte suite

217

(Section S2; Table S1). Therefore, IC-CD or IC-MS analysis used 3 or 4 mL of 3-4 mM NaOH in

218

DIW added to the tubes containing the nylon filters which were sonicated for 15 min, followed by

219

storage in the refrigerator at 4°C overnight with the filter left in the extraction solution (Figure S3),

220

followed by removal of the filter, transfer of an extract aliquot to an autosampler vial, addition of

221

internal standards (for MS only), and direct analysis. For GC-MS analysis, 4 mL of 0.1 M NaOH in

222

Optima® methanol was added to the Falcon® conical tube containing nylon filters and sonicated for

223

15 min. In either extraction for analysis, the filters were removed from the extract prior to removing

224

an aliquot for analysis or further sample preparation. Extraction efficiencies determined by spike and

225

recovery (Section S2; Table S1) were applied for quantitative determinations in calibration chamber

226

experiments due to the controlled matrix and our use of internal standards. Since the recoveries across

227

the homologue suite were broadly quantitative, we report the determined ambient atmospheric mixing

228

ratios through the use of internal standards, but without recovery correction, to present conservative

229

values. Internal standards were added prior to sample preparation for GC-MS analysis, adapted from

230

the method of Ye et al.25 Nylon filter extracts in 0.1 M NH4OH in MeOH were blown down with

231

nitrogen gas at 30 °C. The residues were reconstituted in 500 µL of ethyl acetate and 500 µL DCM.

232

Ten microliters of 0.1 M DDM in DCM were added to derivatize the extracted PFCA analytes. The

tubes were vortexed twice for 10 s and sonicated for 15 min to promote the completion of the reaction,

234

followed by transfer to an autosampler vial for analysis.

2.3

Validation of new nylon material for acid sampling

236

Nylon-based PAS have been well-characterized for collecting HNO 3(g) in the atmosphere

237

(Place et al., 2018), but recently the standard material, Nylasorb, has been discontinued and

238

alternatives needed to be identified. Thus, quality control checks were necessary to validate the new

239

material in these samplers using HNO3, in addition to a controlled calibration for TFA.

240

An ambient intercomparison was first undertaken to measure HNO 3(g) in outdoor air using

241

nylon passive sampling with filters manufactured by Sartorius, due to the Nylasorb discontinuation

242

by Pall (SI; Section S3). The new filters were deployed alongside acid-selective sodium carbonate-

243

coated annular denuders attached to a vacuum pump. This experiment was conducted to determine

244

whether the sampling rate of the new nylon membrane was the same or different from the previously

245

validated Nylasorb material.17 Three deployments were conducted between July 2020 and April 2021

246

on the roof of the Petrie Science and Engineering Building at York University in Toronto, Ontario,

247

Canada (44.7738o N, 79.5071oW, 220 m above sea level). Meteorological conditions were monitored

248

using a co-located customized Campbell Scientific weather station that included an anemometer,

249

temperature, pressure, and relative humidity sensors (Table S2). The annular denuder preparation

250

procedure followed the EPA Compendium Method IO-4.2.41 Specific details of the sampling strategy

251

and annular denuder preparation and extraction are presented in the SI (Section S2). Denuders were

252

deployed in one or two medium volume active air samplers (URG-3000ABC, URG Corp, Chapel

253

Hill, NC, USA), containing four to eight annular denuders, and 2.5 µm cutoff particulate matter

254

cyclones to prevent sampling of aerosols with the gas, as these small particles pass through the

255

denuders by design. The flow rate for each denuder was ~8 L min -1. The first and second deployments

256

consisted of a total of 8 denuders, while only four denuders were used to validate the determined

257

sampling rate in the third. Field blank filter pack assemblies were exposed to outdoor air for 30 s

258

when deploying the sampling filters. Aqueous extracts of the annular denuders were stored at 4 oC

259

until analysis by IC (Section S3).

260

2.4

Calibrating PAS with gaseous trifluoroacetic acid

261

To effectively determine the sampling rate of our nylon-based PAS they need to be exposed

262

to measured quantities of gas phase PFCAs. Here we use TFA and establish its sampling rate using

263

orthogonal measurements by annular denuders. Due to its low molecular weight, TFA is the most

264

volatile of the PFCA suite and known to be the most abundant in the atmosphere, making this

265

calibration ideal to pursue.15,21–25 Calibrations performed under controlled conditions to minimize bias

266

in the determined sampling rate due to changes in temperature, humidity, and wind speeds. We created

267

stable and atmospherically-relevant TFA mixing ratios and humidity using an atmospheric simulation

268

determination.28,42 Our chamber gas handling system was developed in-house with all components

270

described in detail in the SI (Section S4 and Figure S6). It includes a home-built zero-air generator

271

(adapted from 43) to control dilution rates for setting TFA mixing ratios, a permeation device to emit

272

a constant mass of TFA,44 a clean 1 m3 perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) atmospheric chamber (Welch

273

Fluorocarbon, Inc) outfitted with two fans (Orion fans, OA4715-12TB) to keep the contents well

274

mixed, and retort stands to affix the PAS within the chamber interior. A simple sensor

275

(ONA47D9XCF, Pimoroni Enviro+) inside the chamber measured relative humidity and temperature.

276

Methods for the preparation and extraction of denuders have been previously described in Ye et al.25

277

and can be found in detail in the SI (Section S5). Passive samplers and denuders were analyzed using

278

IC-CD. Full analytical details can also be found in Section S5 of the SI. Briefly, the IC-CD was

conducted on a 300 μL sample aliquot using an anion-selective preconcentration column (5×23mm,

280

18 µm dp, 6% DVB) followed by separation on an anion-exchange analytical column (AS23 4×250

281

mm, 6 µm dp, 55% DVB, Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 1 mL min -1 using a gradient separation.

282

The annular denuder was necessary to quantify gas-phase TFA within the chamber, as it was

283

expected to undergo wall interactions (SI; Section S6), reducing the mixing ratio compared to that

284

assumed when using only the TFA permeation rate. 45,46 Chamber experiments were performed at TFA

285

mixing ratios of 135 or 373 pptv (equivalent to 0.7 and 1.9 µg m-3) at 27 ± 3 °C and a relative humidity

286

(RH) of 40 ± 5 %, with sampling times varying from hours to days. In total, these experiments

287

delivered 14 exposure levels (i.e. concentration x time) to triplicate PAS placed within the chamber

288

for a single experiment, for a total of 42 measurements. Each chamber experiment included an annular

289

denuder sample, for a total of 14. Combined, these were used to generate the sampling rate curve via

290

linear regression of the mass of TFA extracted from the nylon filters (ng) relative to the time-weighted

291

concentration of TFA present in the chamber measured by the annular denuder.

292

2.5 Ambient atmospheric sampling

293

The PAS were deployed in four locations in three areas of Canada: Saturna Island, BC;

294

Toronto, ON (two locations); and Tadoussac, QC (Section S7; Table S3). Saturna Island samples were

295

collected on a remote hilltop approximately 1 km from the coast. A single sample was collected from

296

Dec 2021 to Dec 2022. Toronto samples were collected on the rooftop of Petrie Science and

297

Engineering Building at York University, with five samples collected between May 2022 and June

298

2023. A second set of five Toronto samples was collected from a residential area between April 2022

299

and June 2023. Tadoussac samples were collected in a rural area approximately 750 m from the St.

300

Lawrence River. Four samples were collected between January and October 2022. Three replicates

301

were deployed during each period at each site, though some were lost during sampling (Table S3).

302

Field blanks were brought to the site and exposed for 10 seconds before being sealed again within

303

Ziploc bags. Sampling heights at least 0.5 m above the ground. Samples were extracted and analyzed

304

by GC-MS or IC-MS. Full IC-MS method details can be found in the SI (Section S5). Briefly, 750

305

μL of the sample was injected to an anion-selective concentrator column (5×23mm, 18 µm dp, 6%

306

DVB) and separated by anion exchange (2×250mm, 7 µm dp, 55% DVB, alkanol quaternary

307

ammonium exchanger) using a mobile phase gradient. Isotopically labelled internal standards were

308

added to all samples prior to analysis, where each PFCA was corrected for matrix effects and

309

instrument fluctuations with its corresponding mass-labelled internal standard, except PFPrA which

310

used the 13C4-PFBA mass-labelled internal standard. This internal standard has a different retention

311

time from PFPrA and may not properly account for ion suppression or enhancement that can occur

312

for PFPrA in each sample. Thus, the quantification for PFPrA is less robust than the other PFCAs in

313

this method.

3. Results and discussion

316

3.1 Passive Sampling Method Innovations, Quality Control, and Validation

317

Several adaptations for this sampling methodology were implemented and are briefly

318

described here with full details provided in the SI. To reduce costs, the protective overlying filter of

319

PTFE was replaced with one of PP and the resulting ambient atmosphere intercomparison of triplicate

320

samples with each approach showed no significant difference in the collected mass. A slight increase

321

in the lower limits observed for replicate relative standard deviation when measuring C2-C6 PFCAs

322

underwent an increase from 0.7 to 4.1 % (Section S1). New nylon filter materials were also assessed

323

and were found to exhibit no change in the average HNO 3 sampling rate. However, an increase in

324

variance between replicates with the new nylon material was observed, as the material properties are

325

not focused by the manufacturer on uniformity for gas phase passive sampling (Section S3). As a

326

result, we recommend collection of replicates at all times to ensure the precision of atmospheric

327

abundance measurements can be reported. If future monitoring requires increased method

328

performance, this can be readily obtained by increasing the number of replicate samples to five or

329

more (Section S3).

330

Alongside these changes, additional quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) tests

331

were conducted, specifically targeting PFCAs, that have not been previously reported for HNO 3

332

passive samplers (spike and recovery, field blanks) or annular denuders (field, method, analytical

333

blanks) in order to optimize the quantitative performance of the technique. Quantitative recoveries of

334

PFCAs from the nylon filters were obtained and handling of both apparatuses were confirmed to be

335

analytically robust against systematic error (Section S2).

336

Spiked levels at 100 and 400 ng of TFA were designed to fall within expected levels recovered

337

from chamber experiments which spanned 50-1100 ng followed by IC-CD analysis. Lower

338

concentration spike and recovery experiments were conducted using the IC-MS at relevant masses

339

obtained from ambient samples, with 4 ng for TFA, 20 and 1 ng for PFPrA, and 20 and 0.5 ng for C4-

340

C6. These were all found to yield quantitative recoveries (75-125%) using an extraction solvent of 3

341

mM NaOH conducted at either 4 °C or room temperature. In the absence of a competing ion (OH -), it

342

was not possible to recover the analytes from the filters (< 15 % at either concentration level), with

343

recoveries increasing with OH- concentration. The best overall accuracy and precision were obtained

344

at 3-4 mM for the analyte suite (Figure S3). Similar recoveries were obtained for the GC-MS method,

345

although slightly lower due to losses arising from the additional sample preparation steps (Table S1).

346

Positive controls were also performed with denuder extracts by spiking them with 100 μg of TFA.

16

347

The spiked denuder extract obtained a recovery of 100.7 ± 0.4% (n=3), indicating negligible bias

348

associated with the diluted matrix.

349

Negative controls were performed in the form of extraction solvent and method blanks for the

350

annular denuders, in addition to field blanks for PAS. The GC-MS, extraction solvent, method, and

351

fields blanks (n = 3 each) were found to be below the limit of detection (LOD) for the C3-C6 PFCAs,

352

indicating no discernable contamination arising from the PAS method and from the field sampling

353

procedure. Trace levels of TFA were occasionally detected in field blanks, on the order of 1-5% of

354

the sample mass collected, with higher relative values found where outdoor mixing ratios were low

355

and sampling durations were short. For analysis with the IC-CD, no detectable signal of TFA or

356

PFPrA was observed in the extraction solvent, method, or field blanks of PAS. Overall, the QA/QC

357

resulting from each analysis method demonstrates that PFCA contaminants from the assembling,

358

transport, storage, and disassembling of PAS are below the detection limits of these two techniques.

359

Therefore, signals arising from atmospheric or experimental samples collected in the lab truly reflect

360

the exposure of the nylon substrates and their accumulation of gaseous PFCAs present in those

361

environments.

365

3.2 Chamber calibration of TFA using an atmospheric chamber

366

The nylon-based PAS were calibrated for TFA by inserting them into a clean chamber with a

367

known amount of gas-phase TFA measured by collection on Na 2CO3-coated annular denuders on the

368

chamber outflow. The chamber levels of TFA are considered ultra-trace in the atmosphere.

369

Monitoring TFA in the chamber by annular denuder (µg m -3) corrects the delivered quantities

370

for chamber wall losses. The observed quantities were then multiplied by the sampling duration in the

371

chamber (h) to obtain the sampling rate relationship.28,29,47 As the latter term applies more broadly to

372

pharmacological experiments, we preferentially use the term sampling rate throughout this work. The

373

amount of TFA extracted from the nylon filter was corrected for the known 83% extraction efficiency

374

from spike and recovery (Section S2). The relative standard deviation between PAS triplicates within

375

the chamber ranged from 2%-30%, with 12 of the 14 triplicate sets having a relative standard deviation

376

of 15% or below (Figure 2). This reflects the expected consistent mixing provided by the fans within

377

the chamber. These outcomes are consistent with the variability in calibration reported in other

378

chamber studies for PAS, including previous calibration of nylon PAS for HNO 3.28,29,47,48 The small

379

negative intercept in Figure 2 (red line) might suggest negative bias with the TFA quantified by PAS

380

or positive bias with the TFA quantified by annular denuders.

381

In Section S2, the QA/QC demonstrated that quantitative recoveries were obtained for

382

annular denuders, with method blanks showing no detectable signal. Additionally, PAS spike and

383

recoveries experiments achieved quantitative outcomes, the efficiency of which were corrected for

384

in Figure 2, also with no detectable signal in the PAS blanks. Therefore, a calibration with a non-

385

zero intercept due to bias would not be consistent with the results of the QA/QC, as all calibration

386

samples were above the method LOQ. The assessment of these QA/QC metrics mean that assigning

387

the origin as a known point on the chamber sampling rate curve is justified. This assertion is

388

supported by the error associated with the least-squares intercept clearly encompassing the origin in

389

the free form fit (Figure 2, caption). This final form of the calibration line passing through the origin

390

is consistent with PAS-chamber calibration studies for HNO 3 that have reported PAS negative

391

controls to be free of bias or are able to apply blank correction. 28,29,48

Figure 2. Chamber calibration of PAS for TFA. Each data point represents the mean measurement of
triplicate PAS versus an annular denuder measurement multiplied by exposure time. The error bars
are the standard deviation of triplicate PAS determinations. The sampling rate is determined using the
inverse of the slope obtained by linear regression in the form y=mx+b with R 2 being the coefficient
of determination. Upper and lower boundaries (red dotted lines) represent the confidence bands of the
linear regression at a 99.73% confidence interval of the least-squares regression slope (red line; y =
0.0097 (±0.0018) x - 0.06 (±0.11), R2 = 0.97). When the origin is required to be a point on the line as
determined by the QA/QC results from these experiments, the regression takes the form of the black
line (y = 0.0089 (±0.0010) x, R2 = 0.81). All calibration measurements lie above determined method
LOQs for PAS and denuders (black dotted line).

403

Based on these justifications, the sampling rate function passing through the origin is the most

404

representative approach for accurate analytical determinations (Figure 2). Taking the inverse of the

405

slope, the sampling rate for TFA is 113 ± 12

406

for TFA, so comparison to other studies is not feasible. The coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0.81)

407

indicates a strong linear response for quantifying TFA. We do not observe any suggestion that the

408

PAS neared saturation at the upper range of these calibration levels. While saturation levels of

409

Sartorius nylon filters have not been quantified in the current PAS, they have been characterized with

410

no overlying filters for Nylasorb filters to be 5700 μg m -3 × h of HNO3 or 411 μg of NO3- extracted,

411

which is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than the amount of TFA recovered in our most

412

concentrated extract.29 Considering the current Sartorious nylon filters are thicker, which should result

413

in more chemisorption sites compared to the Nylasorb filters, and that the current setup includes a PP

414

overlying filter that reduces the uptake rate of gas-phase acids, it is expected that the saturation level

415

of the new alternative filters in this work will be greater than the prior report. The resulting

416

atmospheric sampling detection limit for TFA is 7 ppqv at a timescale of one week to 0.6 ppqv at a

417

3-month interval, and commensurately lower if deployed for a year (Section S7, Table S4), provided

418

that the total burden of acids do not exceed the overall filter capacity, which varies from urban to rural

419

environments.

421

3.3 Predicted sampling rate for other PFCAs

422

A chamber calibration using a primary gas standard for PFCAs is time consuming, making

423

reasonable theoretical options to extend the measured TFA sampling to the remaining suite of PFCA

424

homologues appealing. Here we considered two approaches based on our past and current work. First

425

using past determinations of HNO3 sampling rates determined under field conditions, as this would

426

allow comparison to our measured TFA sampling rate as a secondary check on the theoretical model.

427

Second by using the measured TFA rate alone, as a representative member of the PFCA family in

428

terms of molecular properties.

429

Within both approaches, we used a theoretical model based on differences in known molecular

430

diffusion properties of two test molecules. Molecular effusion is the central principle of the PAS

431

collection strategy, leading to the diffusion coefficient-driven uptake of the target PFCAs on the nylon

432

substrate. We considered two frameworks of differing degrees of complexity and therefore accuracy,

433

which were Graham and Fuller’s Laws (eqn S2-S3, Section S8) to assess a relative rate of effusion

434

based on molecular mass alone, or in combination with molecular volume, respectively.

435

In the first approach, the prediction of the TFA sampling rate by Graham and Fuller’s Laws

436

using the field-derived sampling rate of HNO3 was found to be different by 60% from the measured

437

TFA sampling rate in our chamber experiments. A number of underlying environmental and

438

experimental factors are potential driving factors for the discrepancy and are discussed in detail in

439

Section S8 of the SI. Ultimately, a relative sampling rate for PFCAs based on HNO 3 has insufficient

440

experimental grounding to correctly predict the measured TFA sampling rate.

441

Therefore, in our second approach the measured TFA sampling rate was treated as most

442

suitable option for crafting a theoretical determination of sampling rates for ≥C2 PFCAs. Using TFA

443

as a reference also ensures that the target molecules under consideration are all within the same

444

chemical family - consisting of a hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic carboxylate head group. Both laws

445

yield similar predicted values for the ultra-short chain PFCAs (C2-C4) while the longer chained

446

PFCAs yield higher sampling rate slopes through Fuller’s Law. This difference is due to the inclusion

447

of molecular volumes in Fuller’s method, which diverges from Graham’s Law using only relative

448

mass for larger molecules. Here, the sampling rate discrepancy for the longest homologue detected in

449

our ambient work, PFHxA, has a 5% larger predicted value using Fuller’s Law (Table 2). Evidence

450

that Fuller’s Law is better at predicting diffusion rates of organic molecules has been reported. 49–51

451

Gu et al.,49 in particular, demonstrated Fuller’s Law to predict diffusivities of halogenated organic

452

gasses very well when compared with measured values. Some of the molecules tested included

453

fluorinated compounds such as CH2F2 (HFC-32), hexafluorobezene, and 1-fluorohexane, where the

454

difference between the predicted and measured values were ≤ 9 %. Since PFCAs are organic

455

halogenated molecules, Fuller’s Law is therefore better suited for predicting the diffusion rates of gas-

456

phase PFCAs - and by extension their sampling rates. While homologues beyond PFHxA were not

457

detected in our ambient samples (Section 3.4), the phase distribution of longer chain PFCAs (C7-C14)

21

458

is not well established,15 and we provide sampling rate predictions for these molecules in Table S6.

459

The predicted sampling rates can be used to determine atmospheric mixing ratios of these PFCA

460

homologues using our nylon-based PAS, since their recoveries are quantitative (Table S1). Given the

461

very similar physical properties of our PFCA analyte suite, this method is the first to yield a

462

quantitative passive sampling approach that is selective for PFCAs. Uncertainties in these

463

measurements will stem from the variability in the underlying calibration data, although systematic

464

errors have been minimized as much as possible through the chamber experiments with TFA and

465

recovery QA/QC work for the entire analyte suite.

The result provides mixing ratios which should be accurate within an order of magnitude or better for

471

these other PFCA homologues. Greater certainty at this time is not possible, due to the lack of

472

established validated atmospheric sampling methods 52 with which to intercompare our method. This

473

theoretical approach also opens the door to estimating atmospheric levels of other volatile acidic

474

PFAS and haloacetic acids that have similar structural features to TFA and no established gas phase

calibration methodology (e.g., perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids, Gen-X, etc.).

3.4 Measurement of ambient air

477

Measurements of gaseous PFCAs were performed in three different areas of Canada over the

478

course of approximately one year (Figure 3). To determine mixing ratios, we used the calibrated

479

sampling rate of TFA and the Fuller’s Law predicted sampling rates for the C3 to C6 PFCAs.

480

Detection limits vary based on deployment time and analytical method. For an 8-week deployment—

481

similar to the shortest time frame considered here—LODs for PFCAs analyzed using IC-MS (Table

482

S4) ranged from 0.3 to 1.6 parts-per-quadrillion mixing ratios (10 -15 mol mol-1, ppqv) which are

483

equivalent to mass loadings of 3.6 to 15 picograms per cubic metre of air (pg m -3). Despite mass

484

loadings being commonly used to set exposure limits, they are dependent on homologue molecular

485

weight. We consider mixing ratios to be more informative for our discussion when evaluating relative

486

atmospheric abundance and processes governing the formation and fate of PFCAs. In all PAS, TFA

487

was detected, while PFPrA, PFBA, PFPeA, and PFHxA were detected in 86, 93, 57, and 21 % of

488

samples, respectively.

489

The relative mixing ratios of PFCAs generally decrease with increasing chain length, with

490

TFA substantially higher than other PFCAs. Levels of TFA ranged from 11.0 to 200 ppqv, while all

491

other PFCAs were between 0.2 and 26.4 ppqv (Figure 3, Table S3). As expected, as atmospheric

492

mixing ratios approached the method detection limits (Table S4) for the sampling timescale and

493

analytical technique, the variability within the replicate samples (Table S3) increased beyond 30%.

494

Given the extremely low levels quantified by this technique, this level of uncertainty at <10 ppqv

495

mixing ratios is reasonably acceptable. The inverse relationship between chain length and mixing

496

ratios is generally consistent with relative levels reported for atmospheric deposition and air

497

measurements,11,21–25 as well as predicted by a model of atmospheric degradation of PFAS

498

precursors.13 This relative abundance of PFCAs is consistent with known sources, as the number of

23

499

potential atmospheric precursors increases with decreasing chain length. 5,13 This is especially true for

500

TFA, which can be formed from PFAS precursors, as well as numerous heat transfer fluids. 5,53

501

Samples in Toronto and Tadoussac were collected with sufficient temporal resolution to

502

observe seasonal differences. In both locations, we observed that TFA mixing ratios were higher in

503

the summer and lower during the winter. This seasonal trend for gaseous TFA has previously been

504

observed in Toronto24,36 and elsewhere.54–56 Seasonal differences for TFA have been attributed to

505

increased photochemical activity in summer, as well as increased emissions of precursors. 24,36,57 No

506

clear seasonal trend was observed for the other PFCAs. This similarity between seasons is generally

507

consistent with other gaseous C4-C6 PFCA measurements made in Toronto, 24,58 while we are not

508

aware of any other measurements with which to compare our C3 PFCA data.

509

Potential sources of PFCAs vary between the sites sampled: Toronto is an urban area with

510

many potential PFCA sources; Tadoussac is a rural area that is downwind of urban regions; and the

511

sampling location on Saturna Island is a remote site planned by the Canadian Air and Precipitation

512

Monitoring Network to receive mainly marine airmasses from the North Pacific. Gaseous TFA

513

followed the trend of urban>rural>remote, with Toronto measurements highest and the lowest

514

measurement on Saturna Island. This is generally consistent with the spatial trend predicted by models

515

describing atmospheric formation of TFA from precursors.59,60 Similarly, PFPrA was higher in urban

516

Toronto and lowest in remote Saturna Island. The C4 to C6 PFCAs were generally higher in Toronto,

517

but measured levels were more similar across the different areas. This is generally consistent with the

518

spatial trend predicted from atmospheric formation of PFCAs from PFAS precursors. 13 Within

519

Toronto, we observed that levels of TFA were higher at York University compared to the residential

520

Toronto during the summer of 2022 using chemical ionization mass spectrometry with acetate

523

ionization.24 That study measured mean (±standard deviation) TFA of 546 (±255) ppqv over ~8 weeks

524

a few km from York University (Figure S9). While this is higher than the values measured by the

525

PAS, given the spatial and temporal variability in Toronto and measurement uncertainties, we

526

consider these levels to be generally consistent. Other PFCAs were measured at similar levels by the

527

PAS at the two Toronto sites.

acid (PFBA, C4), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA, C5) from three locations in Canada: Saturna
Island, BC, Toronto, ON (York University site), and Tadoussac, QC. Error bars show relative error
(n=2) and standard deviation of replicate (n≥3) samples. PFHxA (C6) was not included because of
low detection frequency. Mass loadings (units: pg m -3) are provided in Table S3, as these units are
used in policy, but not informative in terms of assessing atmospheric formation and fate processes in
a consistent manner across the homologue suite of PFCAs.

4. Conclusion

538

The nylon-based PAS developed to sample atmospheric HNO 3 have been successfully

539

extended for use and calibrated for the collection of gaseous TFA using a primary gas phase standard,

540

with a theoretical extension for the sampling rates of the C3-C6 PFCA homologues. These results

541

present the first ever PAS calibrated for gaseous TFA with the ability to sample ultra-trace levels at

542

the parts per quadrillion (ppqv, 10-15 mol mol-1) at one week sampling durations and sub-ppqv at

543

timescales of months. Rigorous QA/QC was performed to ensure a robust methodology and therefore

544

quantitation of TFA by PAS and annular denuders within the calibration experiment. The QA/QC

545

performed included intensive analysis of reagent through field blanks, spike and recovery at relevant

546

quantities in real atmospheric samples, and inclusion of isotopically labeled internal standards to

547

account for matrix effects in the analysis. Analysis and method detection of the PFCA target suite

548

was accomplished using three analytical instruments: a GC-MS and an IC-CD or IC-MS.

549

The PAS design was optimized compared to our prior work for this analyte suite and to make

550

the method more robust and financially accessible. We replaced the expensive PTFE overlying filter

551

with a cheaper PP filter and found no significant changes in sampling rate and precision. The TFA

552

sampling rate for our custom-built PAS was determined to be 113 ± 12

553

sampling rate for the C3-C6 PFCA homologues were predicted using Graham's and Fuller's law based

554

on this chamber calibration for TFA, which we expect to be accurate considering the very similar

555

physical properties and the knowledge that they are recovered from the PAS quantitatively. Of these

556

two laws, Fuller's law is expected to be best suited for predicting the sampling rate of these organic

557

halogenated compounds and was used to convert recovered quantities to mixing ratios of PFCA

558

collected from across Canada. Atmospheric abundance by homologue showed TFA present in greatest

quantity, with abundance then decreasing with increasing PFCA chain length. The relative abundance

560

between the urban, rural, and remote sampling sites reflected the known sources expected within or

561

upwind of these sampling sites. At a seasonal scale, it was observed that TFA increased in abundance

562

alongside known atmospheric precursor source patterns and oxidative reaction pathways of those

563

precursors. All of these trends are consistent with expectations regarding abundance, distribution, and

564

chemistry governing the presence of gaseous PFCAs in the atmosphere.

565

This novel PAS represents the first PAS specifically calibrated for TFA and the only PAS that

566

is chemically selective for PFCAs. The calibration of our nylon-based PAS for TFA paves the way

567

for measuring similar, difficult to measure, novel acidic compounds while addressing limitations of

568

previous methods, such as selectivity, dynamic range inclusive of ultra-trace detection limits,

569

sampling site selection, and labour intensity, while also minimizing cost.
