Finding relevant chemicals in the vast (known) chemical space is a major challenge for environmental
and exposomics studies leveraging non-target high resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) methods.
Chemical databases now contain hundreds of millions of chemicals, yet many are not relevant. This
article details an extensive collaborative, open science effort to provide a dynamic collection of
chemicals for environmental, metabolomics and exposomics research, along with supporting
information about their relevance to assist researchers in the interpretation of candidate hits. The
PubChemLite for Exposomics collection is compiled from ten annotation categories within PubChem,
enhanced with patent, literature and annotation counts, predicted partition coefficient (logP) values, as
well as predicted collision cross section (CCS) values using CCSbase. Monthly versions are archived on
Zenodo under a CC-BY license, supporting reproducible research, and a new interface has been
developed, including the chemical stripes on patent and literature data, for researchers to browse the
collection. This article further describes how PubChemLite can support researchers in
environmental/exposomics studies, describes efforts to increase the availability of experimental CCS
values, and explores known limitations and potential for future developments. The data and code
behind these efforts are openly available. PubChemLite content can be explored at

Environmental and exposomics researchers are faced with the daunting task of determining which
chemicals, among other factors, may be either potentially detrimental or beneficial in the context of
human and/or environmental health. Non-target screening (NTS) methods leveraging high resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) approaches are now commonly used to explore complex samples due to
high sensitivity and selectivity plus improved availability of HRMS instruments1,2. Ion mobility
spectrometry (IMS), which separates molecules based on their size and shape, is also increasingly
accessible. The calculated collision cross section (CCS) values serve as an additional parameter to
support identification in NTS3,4,5. Nonetheless, the identification and - importantly - interpretation of
features detected during NTS is still challenging, while integration of IMS/CCS into workflows remains
poor, hindering the broader adoption of NTS1. Identification in NTS primarily relies on mass spectral
libraries, suspect lists (lists of hundreds or thousands of chemicals that may occur in the samples) and
chemical databases, as recently reviewed elsewhere1,2.

A diverse array of compound databases, often openly accessible, serve as primary sources of candidates
for identification in NTS. These range from hundreds of thousands to just over a million entries (e.g.,
HMDB6 with 220,945 metabolites and CompTox7 with 1,218,248 chemicals as of 20 Nov. 2024), through
to hundreds of millions of entries (e.g., ChemSpider8, PubChem9 and the Chemical Abstract Services
(CAS) Registry10, with 129, 119 and 219 million chemicals as of 20 Nov. 2024, respectively). Since the CAS
Registry is licensed and ChemSpider introduced limitations to their application programming interface
(API) in 2018, PubChem has become the de facto standard large chemical database for open sciencebased NTS methods. While PubChem, with >1000 sources, integrates the contents of many of the
smaller openly available databases, PubChem also includes tens of millions of entries that are neither
likely to be found in the environment, nor pertinent to the exposome. This hinders both the
performance and efficiency of NTS. Additionally, many of the chemicals in other potential sources for
NTS identification efforts, such as the Global Chemical Inventory (350,000 chemicals)11 and various lists

from European regulators contributing to the NORMAN Suspect List Exchange (NORMAN-SLE)12 include
large proportions of chemicals that have very little supporting evidence about their existence and
relevance, which makes interpretation of potential hits in NTS very challenging.

To mitigate these challenges, a subset of PubChem called PubChemLite was developed specifically to
streamline NTS identification and interpretation13. PubChemLite has been integrated into existing HRMS workflows, such as patRoon14 and MetFrag15. Although PubChemLite is familiar to many researchers
already, the original 2021 article13 was primarily technical. This article explains PubChemLite for an
environmental/exposomics audience and details extensions since the original publication, including the
development of an open experimental CCS pipeline in PubChem, integration of predicted CCS values in
PubChemLite to support IMS, and finally a new web interface (https://pubchemlite.lcsb.uni.lu/).

The full technical details of PubChemLite are published elsewhere13. Briefly, PubChemLite is derived
from major categories relevant to environmental/exposomics applications appearing in the PubChem
Table of Contents (TOC) pages of the PubChem database16. The ten categories currently used to compile
PubChemLite (see Figure 1) are: Agrochemical Information (AgroChemInfo), Associated Disorders and
Diseases (DisorderDisease), Drug and Medication Information (DrugMedicInfo), Food Additives and
Ingredients (FoodRelated), Identification (Identification), Interactions and Pathways – Pathways subset
(BioPathway), Pharmacology and Biochemistry (PharmacoInfo), Safety and Hazards (SafetyInfo), Toxicity
(ToxicityInfo), Use and Manufacturing (KnownUse). These categories have remained consistent since the
original publication, except for the “Biomolecular Interactions and Pathways” category, which was
renamed by PubChem to “Interactions and Pathways” in 2022, then limited to the Pathways subset in
May 2023 (see Results and Discussion). The input files and code for the PubChemLite build system are
available on the Environmental Cheminformatics (ECI) GitLab repository (see Data Availability
Statement).

Any compound with one or more of the selected annotation categories is included. The matching
compounds (represented by PubChem Compound IDentifiers, CIDs) are aggregated by the first block of
the InChIKey into a primary entry and related CIDs, where the primary entry is the neutral or “parent”
form. Entries such as mixtures, disconnected substances, or those causing errors, such as some
transition metals, are excluded (see the build system code for details13). Chemical information (SMILES,
InChI, InChIKey, formula, mass), patent and literature (PubMed) counts plus predicted XlogP values are
retrieved in bulk using PubChem APIs. The chemical identifiers, mass and XlogP values correspond to the
“parent” (primary entry), while the annotation, patent and literature counts are aggregated across all
related CIDs. Importantly, the presence of an entry in PubChemLite means that at least one of these
annotation categories is available for each CID, with the resulting information publicly available on
PubChem to help interpret the relevance of the candidate, see Figure 1. Since the chemical content of
PubChem changes daily and annotation content weekly, PubChemLite is built and evaluated early Friday
mornings, following the weekly PubChem update cycle. New versions are currently released publicly
(typically last Friday of the month) on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5995885 redirects to the latest
version).

Although several methods to predict CCS values are available, few of these are suitable for a large
database like PubChem, or even PubChemLite. The calculation time of quantum methods (e.g., MobCal17
and ISiCLE18) is prohibitive. Furthermore, since ISiCLE only predicts values for C, H, N, O, P and Scontaining compounds, ~40% of PubChemLite would remain uncovered. Machine learning (ML)
prediction methods developed on experimental CCS datasets are much faster, with options including
AllCCS19, CCSbase20, SigmaCCS21, DeepCCS22. and CCS Predictor 2.023. Since initial calculations with
CCSbase were promising, this became the method of choice to establish pipelines for PubChemLite.
Calculations are performed using cs3db (the code base behind CCSbase20), which has been re-trained
with the updated experimental database in CCSbase using the same methodology20, modified to run on
PubChem internal systems. Following the monthly PubChemLite release, CCS value calculations (by
PubChem) are triggered on the second day of the following month. The resulting file is transferred by
FTP, merged into the PubChemLite files, quality-controlled, then released to Zenodo (DOI:
10.5281/zenodo.4081056 redirects to the latest version).

To ensure that ML models have better coverage of environmentally relevant compounds to improve
their predictions, part of this work involved establishing a pipeline to integrate experimental CCS values
into PubChem. Currently PubChem contains CCS values from the Baker Lab24,25, CCSbase20 and four
collections via the NORMAN-SLE12: S50 CCSCOMPEND26,27, S61 UJICCSLIB28,29, S79 UACCSCEC3,30 and S116
REFCCS31. These values are displayed on individual records in PubChem and navigable in the PubChem
Classification Browser via the CCSbase, Baker Lab, NORMAN-SLE and the Aggregated CCS trees (see
Figure 2).

PubChemLite Web Interface

141
142
143

The PubChemLite web interface is developed as a plugin for the ELIXIR-Luxembourg Data Catalog32,33. It
is developed in Python, CSS, HTML and Javascript, using RDKit34,35 for structure depiction. For full details,
see the PubChemLite-web code on GitLab.

The PubChemLite interface is based almost entirely on the information available in the archived
PubChemLite-CCSbase CSV files (see Figure 3), except that additional synonyms (excluded from
PubChemLite files for efficiency) are retrieved from the PubChem FTP site for better searchability.
Additionally, records are enhanced with visualizations of the annotation categories and tables of the CCS
and associated adduct mass values. Finally, the chemical stripes36,37,38 are included where available for
both literature and patents (see Figure 4). The original chemical stripes R version was rewritten in
Python for integration in PubChemLite-web, with code available in both repositories38,39.

168

The performance of PubChemLite is monitored weekly with every build using the evaluation dataset of
977 compounds established in the original publication13. The ranking performance has been quite stable
over the three-year period, with median rank=1 of 794 (81.3%), 1-2 of 917 (93.9%), 1-5 of 960 (98.3%)
and 12 (1.2%) failures (compounds absent from PubChemLite due to lack of corresponding annotation).
The respective ranges [min;max] are rank=1 [788;800], 1-2 [909;922], 1-5 [955;963] and [10;15] failures.
The current performance is close to the median values: rank=1 of 797, 1-2 of 916, 1-5 of 960 and 11
failures and slightly better than the original publication (794, 912, 954, respectively, and 15 failures;
October 2020 version). The distribution of annotation content included in PubChemLite, including the
total number of entries between Feb. 2022 and Nov. 2024, is shown in Figure 5.

Overall, despite PubChem increasing in content dramatically over that time, PubChemLite has remained
generally stable at ~380,000 entries, growing slowly over time. The systematic increase of the
BioPathway category (purple, Figure 5) starting in October 2022 introduced a number of irrelevant
candidates in preliminary results of non-target studies40 and caused continual expansion; this content
was switched to the “Pathways” subcategory rather than the entire “Interactions and Pathways”
heading in May 2023 (see Figure 1), improving performance and interpretability of candidate hits. The
dramatic increase in FoodRelated information was due to the integration of FooDB41 into PubChem
annotation content; despite the large increase in that category, the overall candidate numbers remained
stable, indicating that many of these candidates already had other annotation content in PubChemLite.
The increase and then decrease of content in the DiseaseDisorder category in March-April 2024 was due
to an update of one data source that suddenly introduced many low-quality candidates - upon
contacting the contributor they checked their data and identified several issues; the fixes were
processed by 12 April (see Figure 5). Overall, the continuous monitoring and use of PubChemLite in
various NTS studies helps ensure relevance and usefulness for the community.

The experimental CCS data in PubChem currently (5 Nov. 2024) includes a total of 22,192 experimental
CCS values corresponding to 8099 unique compounds (CIDs). The contributions include 1554 CCS values
for 1136 CIDs from the Baker Lab24,25; 17,187 CCS values for 6242 CIDs from CCSbase20; and 3451 CCS
values corresponding to 869, 574, 148 and 205 CIDs from the NORMAN-SLE12 collections S50
CCSCOMPEND26,27, S61 UJICCSLIB28,29, S79 UACCSCEC3,30 and S116 REFCCS31, respectively. Information is
available for 98 adducts, where the most common adducts are [M+H]+ (7545 CCS values, 4278 CIDs), [MH]- (4279 CCS values, 2064 CIDs), [M+Na]+ (4064 CCS values, 2831 CIDs), [M+K]+ (1179 CCS values, 1140
CIDs) and [M+H-H2O]+ (1154 CCS values, 1113 CIDs).

Predicted CCS values calculated with CCSbase are available for all but 12 CIDs in PubChemLite, since
these could not be parsed with RDKit (the toolkit used in cs3db), despite being compatible with the
toolkits used in PubChem (OpenEye) and MetFrag (CDK). Toolkit compatibility has been explored
elsewhere recently42. Nevertheless, 12 failures out of 389,779 CIDs corresponds to only ~0.003% of the
dataset. In contrast, 11,373 (~2.9%) XlogP values are missing from the same file (values cannot be
calculated with the XlogP model43 used by PubChem). The CCSbase model currently in use has been
trained on a slightly different set to the public CCSbase website and the numbers integrated in
PubChemLite may differ slightly. Since a major motivation to improve the availability of open
experimental CCS values was to increase the amount of relevant data for predictive systems such as
CCSbase, the pipelines presented in this article have been designed to allow upgrades of the CCSbase
model once they are ready. The predicted CCS values in PubChemLite have already been applied in NTS
studies44.

PubChemLite has been used in several NTS applications; user feedback helps ensure the relevance for
environmental screening. Collaborative research activities have already identified less relevant content
(as described above), but also poor coverage (possible lack of annotation content) for compounds in
sediments. The chemical stripe integration helps researchers visualize and interpret the chemical history
over time36, while the annotation summary pages display basic information available simply, providing
direct access to PubChem for the full content. The predicted CCS values will help improve NTS workflows
for IMS, while the growth of the experimental CCS dataset will help predictive models such as CCSbase
improve
accuracy
and
relevance

time.
