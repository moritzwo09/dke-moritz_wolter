Abstract: The numerous risks associated with the toxicity of conventional quaternary

19

ammonium salts (QASs) to various groups of living organisms have prompted the search for

20

new, safer biologically active compounds synthesized in a sustainable manner from renewable

21

raw materials. Here, we describe new QASs of natural origin containing quinine-based cation

22

and anions derived from proteinogenic amino acids – L-asparagine and L-alanine. The quinine-

23

derived QASs were thoroughly characterized in terms of correctness of chemical structure,

24

physicochemical properties, and biological activity. It was discovered that due to quinine

25

activity, the new salts exhibit strong antifeedant activity toward stored products pests, and in

26

the case of elongation of the alkyl substituent in the 1-alkylquininium cation, they also become

27

potent disinfectants.

28

The performed analyses also allowed to assess the environmental risk by determining toxicity

29

to monocotyledonous (Sorghum bicolor) and dicotyledonous (Sinapis alba) terrestial plants,

30

freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna) at various

31

concentrations of the test substance. None of the QASs of natural origin showed phytotoxicity,

32

and salts containing short alkyl substituents in quinine-based cations were noticeably less toxic

33

to aquatic organisms than the other tested compounds. The results indicate that although a trade-

34

off between antimicrobial activity and aquatic toxicity must be made when designing new

35

quinine-based antiseptics, it is possible to obtain potent, naturally-derived and relatively low-

36

toxic biopesticides based on quinine and amino acids.

1. Introduction

42

Quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) are a group of chemicals manufactured and used on a mass

43

scale around the world. Their favorable surface properties and biological activity have resulted

44

in decades of use as cleaning agents, emulsifiers, preservatives, algicides, cosmetic additives,

45

as well as antiseptics and disinfectants (Arnold et al., 2023; De et al., 2015). However, the

46

increasing use of conventional, fully synthetic QASs, particularly evident in recent years due

47

to the COVID-19 pandemic (Arnold et al., 2023), represents a significant environmental burden

48

due to their limited biodegradability, accumulation tendencies (Pati and Arnold, 2020) and their

49

very high toxicity toward organisms present in water and soil (Badmus et al., 2021;

50

Kaczerewska et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2015). Due to the persistence of QASs in the

51

environment at constant, low concentrations, there is also a genuine risk of widespread

52

acquisition of resistance by pathogenic microbes to this most commonly used type of

53

disinfectants (Jia et al., 2022). Moreover, due to their good surface properties and ability to

54

form micelles, QASs may also be responsible for the spread of hydrophobic toxic substances

55

in the environment (Badmus et al., 2021).

56

For the above reasons, a strategy of replacing toxic QASs characterized by low biocompatibility

57

with safer active substances of natural origin and taking into account environmental risks of

58

their production and use is reasonable (Zhang et al., 2021). This approach involves replacing

59

fully synthetic cationic QASs with salts of natural origin, including amphiphilic betaine

60

derivatives (Homa et al., 2024; Merkova et al., 2018; Vonlanthen et al., 2011), which can be

61

obtained in sustainable ways and are characterized by lower ecotoxicity. A particularly

62

interesting variant of this strategy consists in the use of natural compounds with favorable

63

physicochemical or biological properties as a scaffold for new active ingredients. For example,

64

quinine, the oldest, naturally derived antimalarial drug, is currently attracting interest in the

65

scientific community and provides a promising foundation for the structures of active

66

pharmaceutical ingredients (Jones et al., 2015; Terunuma and Hayashi, 2022). In this regard, it

67

should be noted that recently effective methods have been developed for obtaining QASs with

68

a cation derived from quinine (McNeice et al., 2020; Pernak et al., 2020), for which a number

69

of beneficial applications have been proposed to date. Quinine-based QASs may be applied as

70

catalysts for stereochemical reactions that are stable in alkaline media (McNeice et al., 2020),

71

modifiers for enantiomer separation (Sintra et al., 2019), and plant growth regulators

72

(Rzemieniecki et al., 2021). Due to the confirmed antifeedant properties toward insects

73

exhibited by quinine (Jermy, 1990; Lazzari et al., 2024; Ramaswamy et al., 1992), the prospect

74

of application of quinine-based QASs as biopesticides to reduce insect feeding on plants and

75

stored grain may represent a promising direction (Pernak et al., 2020). The search for new ways

76

to counteract insect feeding in a sustainable and environmentally safe manner is particularly

77

important, since ongoing global warming significantly contributes to the increase in insect

78

metabolism, as well as their need for food. In the case of a 2 °C temperature rise compared to

79

the pre-industrial levels, yield losses caused by pest insects could increase by as much as 46%

80

for wheat, 13% for rice and 31% for corn (Deutsch et al., 2018). Given that the projected

81

increase in global temperature is very likely to reach 2.5–2.9 °C by the end of this century

82

according to the latest UN report (United Nations Environment Programme, 2023), pest activity

83

is also expected to rise faster and to higher levels.

84

In previous work, no attention was paid to the environmental fate of quinine-based QASs as a

85

new type of pollutant, nor did they consider the toxicity of these compounds to living

86

organisms. In order to mitigate negative environmental effects, in the course of designing the

87

new compounds, the strategy of obtaining new naturally-derived QASs was extended. The

88

cation derived from the plant alkaloid was combined with natural anions of L-asparagine and

89

L-alanine, proteinogenic amino acids that constitute the building blocks of proteins in living

90

organisms. There is no information about harmful effects of these amino acids on human and

91

animal health (Garlick, 2004). The synthesized quinine-derived QASs were subsequently tested

92

in terms of their lipophilicity, antimicrobial activity, biopesticidal activity toward pest insects,

93

and their toxicity toward terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms. The results obtained in the

94

course of this study allowed a meaningful determination of the application potential of the new

95

quinine derivatives, as well as the risks associated with their possible introduction into the

96

environment.

141

method (Pernak and Rzemieniecki, 2020). First, quinine monohydrochloride dihydrate was

142

dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (0.9 dm3 per 100 g of hydrochloride) at 25 °C, and then, an

143

equimolar amount of potassium hydroxide was added. The precipitate was filtered off and

144

thoroughly washed with warm (40–50 °C) water. In the next stage, the obtained quinine free

145

base was subjected to quaternization with 1-bromoalkanes comprising 4, 8, or 12 carbon atoms

146

in the alkyl chain according to the methodology described previously (Rzemieniecki et al.,

147

2021). 1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)quininium bromide was obtained according to a similar

148

methodology. First, quinine free base (0.03 mol, 9.733 g) was alkylated using 2-bromoethanol

149

(0.0315 mol, 3.936 g). The reaction was conducted for 48 hours at 35 °C in 30 cm3 of either

150

DMSO or DMF. The post-reaction mixture was transferred to a dropping funnel and added

151

dropwise to vigorously stirred ethyl acetate, and the resulting precipitate was filtered off, dried,

152

and recrystallized twice from methanol-acetone (1:3 volumetric ratio). The resulting quaternary

153

ammonium bromides were pulverized, dried and stored over P4O10. A semi-automatic EasyMax

154

reactor with a vessel of 100 cm3 equipped with a reflux condenser, a stir bar and a temperature

155

sensor (Mettler Toledo, USA) was used to perform all quaternization reactions.

156

2.3.2. Quinine-derived QASs with amino acid-derived anion

157

In the last stage, L-asparagine and L-alanine QASs with quinine-derived cations were obtained

158

using the previously obtained bromides as cation sources. First, the respective quaternary

159

ammonium bromide (0.01 mol) was dissolved in ethanol (20 cm3) and placed in a 50 cm3

160

EasyMax™ reaction vessel equipped with a stir bar and a temperature sensor. Next,

161

AmberLite™ HPR550 OH highly alkaline anionic resin (15 cm3) was placed in the vessel, and

162

the system was stirred for the next 15 minutes. The resin was subsequently filtered off from the

163

post-reaction mixture and washed with 10 cm3 of ethanol. In the next step, 20 cm3 of aqueous

164

solution containing 0.01 mol of the respective amino acid (L-asparagine, 1.321 g or L-alanine,

165

0.891 g) in zwitterionic form was added to the filtrate and the mixture was stirred for the next

166

30 minutes. The solvents were afterwards removed using a rotary vacuum evaporator, and the

167

raw product was dissolved in 15 cm3 of anhydrous methanol. In the next step, the resulting

168

solution was filtered to remove any potential residue of unreacted amino acid. The solvent was

169

afterwards removed using a rotary vacuum evaporator, and the residue was dried using a

170

Schlenk line (pressure: 2·10-5 bar) while heating to 40 °C for at least 8 hours. The obtained

171

QASs were refrigerated at 4 °C in airtight vessels to prevent moisture absorption and potential

172

decomposition.

173

2.4. Water solubility

174

Solubility in water of the obtained compounds at 25 °C was tested using the flask method

175

described in the OECD 105 Guidelines (OECD, 1995a). First, a preliminary test was performed,

176

which consisted in adding increasing amounts of water to a determined amount (0.1 g) of test

177

substance and shaking it for 10 minutes after each addition to determine an approximate

178

solubility. Subsequently, exact solubility was determined for low-soluble compounds. First, a

179

determined amount of pulverized solid, greater than can be dissolved in 10 cm3 of water, was

180

placed in 3 glass vials, and then water (in 10 cm3 aliquots) was added to each vial. In addition,

181

2 more vials containing the same amount of water, but 2 or 3 times more test substance, were

182

prepared to establish the effect of the dissolution of potential impurities on the solubility results.

183

The vessels were stoppered and then stirred at 30 °C for one day. Next, one of the standard vials

184

was equilibrated at 25 °C for 24 hours, and then the aqueous solution was collected from the

185

suspension with a syringe equipped with a filter with a hydrophilic membrane. The

186

concentration of test compounds in water was determined spectrophotometrically using a

187

VWR® UV-5300PC spectrophotometer (VWR International, Belgium) based on calibration

188

curves made previously (at λmax = 235 nm). Second and third vials were tested after being stirred

189

at 30 °C for 2 and 3 days, respectively, using the same procedure. Two additional vials with an

190

increased amount of test substance were tested after 3 days of stirring (alongside the third vial).

191

Finally, the solubility was calculated as the average of 5 results collected for each compound.

192

2.5. Octanol-water partition coefficient

193

The octanol-water partition coefficient values (KOW) of the synthesized salts were determined

194

by the shake-flask method according to the OECD Test No. 107 guidelines (OECD, 1995b).

195

Measurements were performed using mutually saturated distilled water and 1-octanol in a glass

196

vial containing a magnetic stir bar. The synthesized products were dissolved in distilled water

197

(or 1-octanol, depending on their water solubility) at chosen concentration corresponding to the

198

values adopted for the phytotoxicity and aquatic toxicity tests (1 g per 1 dm3 of octanol or

199

water), and then proper amounts of the second solvent (octanol or water) were added. Two

200

duplicate runs were also carried out with different solvent ratios: 2 cm3 of 1-octanol and 4 cm3

201

of water (2:1), 4 cm3 of 1-octanol and 4 cm3 of water (1:1) and 8 cm3 of 1-octanol and 4 cm3 of

202

water (1:2). All vials have been shaken at constant temperature of 25 °C. All obtained samples

203

were subsequently centrifuged after 24 h and the aqueous and octanolic phases were collected

204

with a syringe. The concentrations of compounds in water and in 1-octanol were determined

205

spectrophotometrically using a VWR® UV-5300PC spectrophotometer (VWR International,

206

Belgium) based on calibration curves made previously (at λmax = 235 nm for aqueous solutions,

207

236 nm for 1-octanolic solutions). Two repetitions of each measurement were performed in a

208

specific solvent ratio (1:1, 1:2 and 2:1). Finally, the log KOW was calculated as the average of 6

209

results collected for each compound.

bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) of the tested substances was determined

221

using the microdilution method based on methodology described previously (Kaczmarek et al.,

222

2021) with some modifications. First, a series of two-fold dilutions of the tested substances in

223

the concentration range of 0.48–1000 mg dm-3 were prepared in 96-well microplates in MH

224

broth (for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli), TSB (for S. marcescens, M. catarrhalis and M.

225

226

or PDB (for F. graminearum). Then, suspensions prepared from 24-hour cultures of indicator

227

microorganisms in broth media at a final concentration of 105 CFU cm-3, were inoculated into

228

the microplates with diluted substances. Incubation was carried out for 24 hours at 30 or 37 °C,

229

depending on the indicator microorganism. The inoculate of F. graminearum was prepared in

235

the growth of the microorganism by at least 90%. MBC/MFC values were determined by spot

236

inoculation of 10 mm3 of cultures from wells with no growth observed in the MIC assay on an

237

agar medium and incubation for 24–48 h at 30 or 37 °C. The lowest concentration of the tested

compounds were applied in the form of aqueous solutions at the defined concentration, with the

243

exception of 1-alkylquininium bromides and free base quinine, which were applied in the form

244

of solutions in water-DMSO mixture with volumetric ratio of 7:3. Water-DMSO mixture was

245

used as a control.

246

2.7. Biopesticidal activity

247

The bioassay experiments were conducted using adult granary weevil beetles (Sitophilus

248

granarius L.), larvae of confused flour beetle (Tribolium confusum Duv.) and larvae of khapra

249

beetle (Trogoderma granarium Ev.). Insects were grown on a wheat grain or whole-wheat meal

250

diet in laboratory colonies, which were maintained at 26 ± 1 °C and 60 ± 5% relative humidity.

251

Choice and no-choice tests for insect feeding were conducted following a previously described

252

procedure (Klejdysz et al., 2016). Wheat wafer discs (1 cm in diameter and 1 mm thick) were

253

saturated by dipping them either in methanol only (control) or in a methanolic solution of the

254

studied compounds (1%) to be tested. After evaporation of the solvent (30 min of air-drying),

255

the wafers were weighed and offered to the insects in plastic boxes as the sole food source for

256

5 days. The feeding of insects was recorded under three sets of conditions: (1) on two control

257

discs (CC), (2) on a choice between one treated disc (T) and one control disc (C; choice test),

258

and (3) on two treated discs (TT; no-choice test). Each of the three experiments was repeated

259

five times with 3 adult beetles (S. granarius), or 10 larvae (T. confusum or T. granarium). The

260

number of insects depended on the intensity of their food consumption. The adults used for the

261

experiments were unsexed and 7–10 days old. After 5 days, the discs were reweighed, and the

262

average weight of eaten food was calculated as previously described (Klejdysz et al., 2016).

263

The total deterrence coefficient classifies the total activity of the compounds tested according

264

2.8. Influence on germination and early development of terrestial plants

269

Phytotoxicity tests of the obtained salts were carried out in accordance with OECD 208

270

guidelines (OECD, 2006), using PhytotoxkitTM plastic containers (MicroBioTests, Belgium).

271

Two species of plants – dicotyledonous (white mustard, Sinapis alba) and monocotyledonous

272

(sorghum, Sorghum bicolor) were used as test organisms. The designated wells in plastic

273

containers were filled with 90 cm3 of certified, OECD-compliant dry soil (MicroBioTests,

274

Belgium) and then the soil was saturated with 25 cm-3 of aqueous solution of the analyzed

275

compounds. Two concentrations of test solutions were selected: 1 g dm-3 and 10 g dm-3. For the

276

compounds insoluble in water at 10 g dm-3 only the test at 1 g dm-3 was performed, and in the

277

case of 1-dodecylquininium bromide, which was insoluble in water at 1 g dm-3, the experiment

278

was performed using test solutions with lower concentration (0.1 g dm-3). Pure deionized water

279

was used to saturate the soil in the control sample. Subsequently, a sheet of absorbent paper

280

was placed on the saturated soil, and 10 seeds of the selected plant were placed with 1-cm

281

spaces in a single row. Samples were incubated in vertical position, at 26 ±1 °C for 96 hours

282

and the number of germinating seeds in each sample was checked every 24 hours. After the end

283

of the experiment, photos showing plant development were taken and length of roots and shoots

284

of the young plants was measured using ImageJ software. The average growth of the root and

285

stem was calculated in relation to the results recorded for the control sample.

286

2.9. Aquatic toxicity studies

287

Three aquatic organisms were chosen to assess the acute toxicity of the synthesized compound:

288

freshwater green alga Chlorella vulgaris and a crustacean Daphnia magna. In addition, chronic

289

toxicity of a selected compound was assessed for D. magna in a reproduction test.

2.9.1. Acute toxicity toward algae

291

The experiments were carried out on model C. vulgaris (SAG 211-11b) cells obtained from

292

Culture Collection of Algae at Göttingen University (Germany) according to the methodology

293

described in OECD 201 Guidelines (OECD, 2011). Algae were cultivated in OECD TG

294

medium prepared as described in the Annex 3 of the OECD 201 Guidelines in sterile conditions.

295

To accomodate C. vulgaris to test conditions, algae cells have been cultured in OECD medium

296

for 4 days before tests. The inoculum was continuously aerated with sterile air and illuminated

297

with magenta (red + blue) LED grow light with the illuminance of 5500 ±800 lx. Before tests,

298

the inoculum was diluted with pure medium until its absorbance of monochromatic light (688

299

nm) was in the range of 0.05–0.08 at 10 cm path. To obtain the desired range of concentrations,

300

19 cm3 portions of diluted inoculum were mixed with 1 cm3 of the prepared toxicant solution

301

in OECD medium. In the case of control samples, 1 cm3 of pure OECD medium was added.

302

The selected compounds were tested in triplicates at a series of geometrically decreasing

303

concentrations: 1000, 100, 10, 1, and 0.1 mg dm-3. For 1-dodecylquininium bromide, due to its

304

low solubility in water and expected high toxicity, a different series was used: 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01,

305

and 0.001 mg dm-3. The absorbance at 688 nm was tested for each sample using 10 cm-long

306

glass cuvettes, and the measurements were conducted at the start of the experiment and after 72

307

hours. The contents of all test vessels were mixed and illuminated continuously during the test,

308

and their position was randomized to achieve similar levels of illumination for each sample

309

throughout the experiment. The tests were conducted at 22–23 °C. The rate of algae growth

310

inhibition was calculated according to the following equation:

311

𝜇=

312

where 𝑂𝐷𝑡2 and 𝑂𝐷𝑡1 are the absorbances of the tested solution at the start (𝑡1 ) and at the end

Freshwater D. magna organisms no older than 24 hours were cultured at the Poznan University

Guidelines (OECD, 2004) and used as test organisms according to the methodology compliant

322

with the OECD 202 Guidelines and ISO 6341 standards. The multi-well Daphtoxkit F plates

323

for the tests were purchased from MicroBioTests Inc. (Gent, Belgium). The Elendt M4 medium

324

was aerated for 1 hour before the tests and the organisms had access to food (C. vulgaris

325

suspension) before the start of the test. In the next step, 10 cm-3 aliquots of the solution of a

326

given compound in Elendt M4 medium at the specified concentrations: 1000, 100, 10, 1, and

327

0.1 mg dm-3 (with the exception of 1-dodecylquininium bromide, which was tested at 100, 10,

328

1, 0.1, and 0.01 mg dm-3 concentrations) were introduced into each of the 5 cells in a given row

329

of the Daphtoxkit F plate. In the case of the control samples, pure medium without the addition

330

of toxicant was used. Next, no less than 20 daphnia were placed in the first column of cells.

331

Then, from each of the first cells in the first column, 20 daphnia were taken out and divided so

332

that there were 4 cells in each row containing 5 specimens in 10 cm3 of toxicant solution of the

333

same concentration. Then, the plate was covered with parafilm and closed with a plastic cap.

334

The prepared kits were incubated at 20 °C without light. Number of motionless organisms were

335

counted after 24 h and 48 h. Immobilization rate was then calculated for each concentration in

2.9.3. Chronic toxicity toward D. magna

345

For chronic toxicity testing, D. magna organisms from the same culture as the individuals used

346

for acute toxicity testing were used. The experiment was carried out according to the semi-static

347

test methodology described in the OECD 211 Guidelines (OECD, 2012). The solutions of a

348

selected compound in non-aerated Elendt M4 medium at sub-lethal concentrations (determined

349

based on the results of the acute toxicity test) were placed in 5 glass beakers for each

350

concentration. Pure medium was used for control samples. In the next step, a single female D.

351

magna organism no older than 24 hours was placed in each vessel and the vessels were

352

illuminated with white LED light with the illuminance of 1200 ±600 lx and 16L:8D

353

photoperiod. The range finding experiment was conducted for 21 days. The test medium was

354

renewed 3 times a week, and the organisms were fed living algal cells (C. vulgaris) daily.

355

Following the appearance of first brood, living offspring was counted and removed daily from

356

the vessels. The parent animals which died accidentally or inadvertently were excluded from

357

the test. At the end of the experiment, the number of living offspring produced per surviving

358

parental animal was counted and the effect of each concentration of the toxicant on D. magna

359

reproduction was calculated and expressed in relation to the results recorded for the controls.

363

Currently, the design of methods for the efficient synthesis of new biologically active

364

substances poses a challenge due to the need to adapt the developed method to the principles of

365

green chemistry and sustainable development and prevent waste production, while maintaining

366

the cost-effectiveness of the process, the possibility of scale-up and the possibility of obtaining

367

the desired substances of high purity. The significant scale of this problem is illustrated by the

368

amount of the environmental factor (E-factor, i.e., the ratio of the mass of waste per mass of

369

product). Typical values of this indicator for the processes of obtaining pharmaceuticals and

370

fine chemicals are in the range from 5 to 100 (Sheldon, 2017), which shows the problem

371

associated with the significant amount of waste generated by the above-mentioned chemical

372

industries. In the course of multistage synthesis of compounds with often complex chemical

373

structures, technological problems also cause side reactions that result in impurities that are

374

difficult to separate without chromatographic methods.

375

The above problem occurs, among others, in the case of the alkylation of quinine, which

376

degrades at elevated temperatures with the formation of numerous derivatives with similar

377

chemical structures (Dawidowicz et al., 2018). In our past research, we proposed a favorable

378

method for highly efficient (95% yield) conversion of technical quinine hydrochloride extracted

379

from natural raw material (cinchona bark) into quinine free base (Pernak and Rzemieniecki,

380

2020), followed by efficient alkylation of quinine using 1-bromoalkanes and DMSO as solvent

381

at 35 °C to reduce the amount of degradation products of the alkaloid (Pernak et al., 2020). A

382

thorough three-step purification of the crude product yielded QASs with 1-alkylquinium cation

383

in satisfactory yields (>80%) (Scheme 1).

384

We applied an analogous method to obtain 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium bromide, which to our

385

knowledge has not yet been described previously. However, the introduction of a hydroxyl

386

moiety into the substituent significantly altered the properties of the finished product, thus it

387

was necessary to modify and develop a new method for purifying the reaction mixture to

16

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9146-0082 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

388

remove the resulting quinine degradation products. In the first stage of purification, the post-

389

reaction mixture was slowly introduced into the ethyl acetate, which acted as an anti-solvent.

390

The precipitate was subsequently recrystallized twice from a mixture of methanol and acetone.

391

Since the yield of the synthesis and purification process of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium

392

bromide was relatively low (56%), an attempt was made to select more favorable synthesis

393

conditions. When the reaction environment was changed from DMSO to a solvent with similar

394

physicochemical properties – DMF – an increase in total process yield was achieved (up to

395

73%), most likely due to the precipitation of a larger amount of the main product in the first

396

purification step. At the same time, it should be noted that while the use of DMF provides

397

significantly better process efficiency and translates into a reduction in the amount of waste

398

generated per product mass output, this solvent is considered as potential carcinogen and long-

399

term exposure results in harmful effects to human health (Luo et al., 2001). Therefore, further

400

research is warranted to develop more efficient and safer methods for the synthesis and

401

purification of quinine derivatives with a 2-hydroxyethyl substituent. However, the solvents

402

used in the course of purification of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium bromide belong to the group

403

of media recommended by the CHEM21 solvent selection guide, and moreover, DMSO (unlike

404

DMF) is not considered a hazardous solvent (Prat et al., 2016). In addition, the solvents can be

405

easily recovered and reused in the same process. The results of the syntheses and the basic

406

properties of quinine-based quaternary bromides with butyl (1Br), octyl (2Br), dodecyl (3Br),

407

and 2-hydroxyethyl (4Br) are summarized in Table 1.

Scheme 1. Process of obtaining quinine-derived QASs with an amino acid anion.

411

In the next step, the bromide anion was exchanged for the natural anion of a proteinogenic

412

amino acid: L-asparagine or L-alanine. The bromide anion is characterized by limited acute

413

toxicity (van Leeuwen et al., 1987), however, in elevated concentrations it exhibits neurotoxic

414

effects (Thornton and Haws, 2020), and also affects iodine metabolism in the body (Pavelka,

415

2009). According to the 4th principle of green chemistry (“Designing safer chemicals”), it is

416

reasonable to replace it with anions characterized by the absence of toxic effects on the human

417

body (Garlick, 2004). To incorporate the amino acid anion into quinine-based QASs, the

418

previously described method of converting 1-alkylquininium or 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium

419

bromides into the corresponding quaternary ammonium hydroxides using anionic ion exchange

420

resin in ethanol of natural origin was used. The resulting hydroxides were then neutralized with

421

the appropriate anion source to yield the desired products and water (Pernak et al., 2020). The

422

method is sustainable and conforms to the principles of green chemistry, and its main

423

advantages include low energy input (the process is conducted at atmospheric pressure at room

424

temperature), very high yields (>99%), no contamination of the final product with halides, and

425

the use of safe reaction media that can be easily regenerated and reused. The only by-products

426

are the water formed during neutralization (Scheme 1) and the inorganic salt with a bromide

427

anion obtained after regeneration of the ion exchange resin.

428

Due to the insolubility of the zwitterionic L-asparagine and L-alanine in ethanol, the amino acids

429

were added in the form of an aqueous solution. After evaporation of the solvents and drying of

430

the residue, quinine-derived QASs with either L-asparaginate or L-alaninate anion were

431

obtained (Table 1). In contrast to 1Br–4Br, which were white crystalline solids, the obtained

432

QASs with the amino acid anions were amorphous solids with glassy appearance at room

433

temperature. According to the results of DSC analyses, new compounds (4Br, 1Asp–4Asp,

434

1Ala–4Ala) did not exhibit first- or second-order phase transitions in the measurement range

435

from -80 to 120 °C, although at temperatures exceeding 128 °C, the release of gaseous thermal

436

decomposition products could be observed for QASs containing the amino acid anion. The

437

exact results of the above-mentioned analyses are summarized in Table A.2 (Supplementary

438

Data).

439

Taking into account the need to assess the environmental impact of the new methods of

440

chemical synthesis, we calculated Green Chemistry Metrics (GCM) values for the quinine

441

quaternization (1Br–4Br) and for the anion exchange reaction from bromide to amino acid

442

anion (1Asp–4Asp, 1Ala–4Ala). The results are summarized in Table 1. Despite the 100%

443

atom economy of the quinine conversion reaction to 1Br–4Br, the need for additional media in

444

the course of purification of the finished salt results in an increase of the E-Factor values (8.58–

445

11.13). These values are within the range typical for industrial synthesis of fine chemicals

446

(Sheldon, 2017). The lower efficiency of the 4Br synthesis process results in higher E-Factor

447

values compared to the more efficient syntheses of 1Br–3Br compounds. The E-Factors for the

448

aforementioned reactions may be lowered by improving the selectivity of the process to lower

449

the amount of by-products requires to be separated.

The anion exchange process is characterized by more favorable GCM values compared to the

456

syntheses of 1Br–4Br. Despite the lower atom economy (82–86%) resulting from the nature of

457

exchange reaction, the total alkalization and neutralization efficiency is almost equal to the

458

theoretical one (>99%), which translates into a reduction in waste generation and lowers the

459

negative environmental impact. This is indicated by E-Factor values ranging from 1.90 to 1.97,

460

more than twice as low as the lower end of the E-Factor range characteristic of fine chemicals

461

synthesis (5–50).

462

The new amino acid anion QASs (1Asp–4Asp, 1Ala–4Ala) are characterized by higher water

463

content (from 1.44% for 2Ala to 2.69% for 3Ala) compared to the values determined for

464

bromides (0.2–1.0%). This is a typical phenomenon for QASs with the amino acid anion

20

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9146-0082 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

465

(Kaczmarek et al., 2022). More thorough drying would require a dry environment in a glovebox

466

and the use of multi-stage azeotropic distillation. For 4Asp and 4Ala salts with a 2-

467

hydroxyethyl substituent, it was impossible to determine the exact water content due to the high

468

hygroscopicity of these compounds; the water content values recorded during the analyses (9.6

469

±0.24% for 4Asp and 8.2 ±0.15% for 4Ala) were characterized by two orders of magnitude

470

greater measurement error than for the other compounds tested – the error value for other

471

compounds ranged from 0.002 to 0.005%.

472

Low solubility in water may be the reason for the low bioavailability of biologically active

473

substances (Bhalani et al., 2022). Quinine in its free base form is a poorly water-soluble

474

substance (0.05 g dm-3) (Yalkowsky et al., 2010), and the solubility of QASs 1Br–4Br is

475

strongly correlated with the length of the alkyl substituent: 1Br with a short (butyl) substituent

476

(9.3 g dm-3, Table 1) is dissolved more than 70 times better than its analog 3Br with a long

477

(dodecyl) substituent (0.1 g dm-3). In contrast, the presence of a hydroxyl group in the short

478

substituent of 4Br increases the solubility in water to more than 250 g dm-3. It should be noted

479

here that the chemical structure of the anion has an even more significant effect on the solubility

480

of quinine-based QASs in water, and the replacement of the bromide anion with either an L-

481

asparaginate or L-alaninate anion results in ready solubility (more than 1000 g dm-3), with the

482

exception of 3Ala, which still showed very good solubility (more than 500 g dm-3). Given the

483

relationship between the solubility of active substances in water and their bioavailability

484

(Bhalani et al., 2022), combining quaternary cations with low affinity for water with amino acid

485

anions may result in increased bioavailability of new QASs, although more thorough studies

486

are required to confirm the validity of utilizing such a strategy.

489

For all new quinine-based QASs (4Br, 1Asp–4Asp, 1Ala–4Ala), spectral analysis was

490

performed using FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR techniques. The results of the spectral

491

characterization of the products are shown in Supplementary Data (Figs. A.1–A.27). In the 1H

492

NMR spectrum of 4Br, a triplet occurred at a chemical shift of 5.59 ppm, which was not visible

493

in the spectra of 1-alkylquininium bromides (1Br–3Br). This signal was identified as

494

originating from the hydroxyl group in the substituent in 4Br. Moreover, in the 13C NMR

495

spectrum of the same compound, a signal at 61.8 ppm can be observed, originating from the –

496

CH2– group in the immediate vicinity of the hydroxyl group. Both these signals confirm the

497

successful 2-hydroxyethylation process and the correct chemical structure of 4Br. A

comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of 4Br and 1-ethylquininium bromide described in the

499

literature (Pernak et al., 2020) is shown in Fig. A.28 (Supplementary Data).

500

The successful anion exchange for either the L-asparaginate anion (1Asp–4Asp) or the L-

501

alaninate anion (1Ala–4Ala) was also confirmed. The appearance of characteristic signals from

502

the newly introduced amino acid anion was observed, and the integration of the new signals in

503

the 1H NMR spectra indicated an equimolar ratio of cation and anion in the new QASs.

504

Characteristic signals from the anions in the proton spectra of 1Br, 1Asp and 1Ala are shown

505

in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the hydrogen atoms in the –CH2– group in L-asparagine differ

506

in terms of chemical environment due to the chirality of the amino acid (Wishart et al., 2009).

507

It should be noted that the diastereotopic hydrogen atoms in the CH2 group in the L-asparaginate

508

anion are characterized by different chemical environment due to the chirality of the anion. The

509

difference between the chemical shifts of those atoms reaches approximately 0.4 ppm (see

510

signals A1 and A2 in Fig. 1) in the spectra of the obtained L-asparaginates (1Asp–4Asp).

Figure 1. Comparison of 1Br, 1Asp and 1Ala 1H NMR spectra (0.5–7.0 ppm)

513
514

All characteristic signals originating from the quinine-based cations, which were present in the

515

NMR and FT-IR spectra of 1Br–4Br, occurred in the spectra of the L-asparaginate and L-

516

alaninate salts as well, which indicates that no significant changes in the structure of the cation

517

occurred as a result of the ion exchange reaction. The triplet (0.77–0.78 ppm) occurring at the

518

baseline of the 1H NMR spectra, as well as the corresponding signal at approximately 10 ppm

519

in the 13C NMR spectra, originate from the –CH3 group in the ethyl substituent of

520

dihydroquinine, a minor residue of which is present in quinine extracted from natural sources.

521

It should be noted that methods for complete removal of dihydroquinine prior to derivatization

522

of the alkaloid are known, although they require expensive and waste-generating preparative

523

techniques (e.g., HPLC or UPLC with special stationary phases (Borges, 2015)). No significant

524

signals from other organic impurities were observed in the NMR spectra. Nevertheless, it was

525

noted that the introduction of proteinogenic amino acid anions notably alters the chemical shifts

526

of hydrogen atoms in 1-alkylquininium or 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium cations, particularly in

527

the quinuclidine group, compared to the spectra of the corresponding bromides (Fig. 1).

528

To assess the chemical stability of new QASs, additional 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 2

529

exemplary salts: 1Asp and 1Ala were acquired 5 and 7 months following their synthesis,

530

respectively. From the comparison of the obtained spectra (Fig. A.29, Supplementary Data), it

23

531

can be observed that the same signals originating from cations and anions of QASs are present

532

in the spectra obtained both immediately after synthesis and after long-term storage. This result

533

implies that the new QASs can be stored in pure form for at least 5 months without the

534

appearance of any decomposition products in noticeable amounts.

535
536

3.3. Octanol-water partition coefficient

537

As a measure of a lipophilicity, the octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW) makes it possible

538

to estimate the interaction of a chemical compound with a variety of biological interfaces. For

539

example, there is a correlation between the values of log KOW and skin permeability coefficient

540

(Kp) – a parameter describing the ability of an active ingredient to penetrate the skin, which is

541

important for the design of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (Olejniczak et al., 2024). It

542

is also possible to estimate the bioavailability of new pesticides based on their log KOW value

543

(Akamatsu, 2011). In addition, log KOW is useful in predicting the environmental fate of new

544

compounds, for example, by estimating the probability of bioaccumulation of the analyzed

545

substance in tissues or soil. Determination of log KOW values is required by REACH regulations,

546

and a value of this parameter higher than 4 indicates a high probability of bioaccumulation (The

547

European Parliament and the Council, 2006).

548

The new quinine-based QASs are characterized by moderate hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, and

549

their log KOW values range from -1.34 (4Ala) to 1.84 (3Br). The dependence of the log KOW

550

values on the anion and the substituent in the cation is shown in Fig. 2, while the exact values

551

are summarized in Table A.3 (Supplementary Data).

553
554

Figure 2. Octanol–water partition coefficient determined for the quinine-based QASs

555
556

Expectedly, the length of the alkyl substituent in the quinine-based cation is the most important

557

parameter affecting the log KOW. The presence of a long dodecyl substituent is the main reason

558

for the increased lipophilicity of compounds 3Br, 3Asp, and 3Ala, even despite the presence

559

of a highly hydrophilic amino acid-derived anion in the case of the latter two. In contrast,

560

compounds with a short butyl substituent show significant hydrophilicity (log KOW < -0.5). The

561

introduction of a hydroxyl group into the short alkyl chain does not increase the hydrophilicity

562

of 4Br compared to 1Br, although both 4Asp and 4Ala are characterized by lower log KOW

563

values (-1.18 and -1.34, respectively) compared to 1Asp (-0.91) and 1Ala (-0.90). In all

564

analyzed cases, the exchange of the bromide anion for the proteinogenic amino acid anion

565

resulted in a significant reduction in log KOW. It should also be noted that all quinine-based

566

QASs have significantly higher hydrophilicity compared to quinine free base (log KOW = 3.44)

567

(Hansch et al., 1995).

568
569

3.4. Antimicrobial activity

570

In the context of acquiring multidirectional resistance by strains of pathogenic microorganisms

571

against commonly used disinfectants (e.g., benzalkonium chloride) (Maillard, 2022; Merchel
25

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9146-0082 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

572

Piovesan Pereira and Tagkopoulos, 2019; Nordholt et al., 2021), as well as the risks associated

573

with the penetration of synthetic cationic surfactants into the environment and their high

574

toxicity toward aquatic organisms (Tezel and Pavlostathis, 2015), it becomes necessary to

575

search for new, safer active ingredients with potent antimicrobial activity among compounds

576

of natural origin. Therefore, the biological activity of the obtained quinine-based QASs against

577

various microbes that pose a serious threat to human health, especially to immunocompromised

578

patients in hospital settings, was investigated. The microorganisms tested included pathogenic

579

foodborne bacteria (L. monocytogenes) and microbes responsible for opportunistic infections

580

with potentially serious consequences (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, C. albicans).

581

Moreover, the influence of new QASs toward F. graminearum, a pathogen of numerous

582

important crop plants (e.g., barley or rice) at all stages of their development was determined.

583

In addition to salts with bromide or amino acid anion, the antimicrobial activity of quinine in

584

the form of hydrochloride and free base was also examined. All tested microorganisms were

585

susceptible to QAS-type disinfectants and none of the bacterial strains selected contained any

586

genes determining resistance to the antimicrobial activity of this group of compounds (e.g.,

587

qacE or qacEΔ1). Determined values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), as well as

588

minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) are summarized in Table A.4

589

(Supplementary Data).

The results indicate that 3Br, 3Asp and 3Ala comprising a dodecyl substituent showed the

highest antimicrobial activity. They were characterized by MIC values of <1 mg dm -3 for the

600

tested Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative M. catarrhalis, while MIC determined for the

601

other Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. marcescens) and the fungi R.

602

mucilaginosa and F. graminearum ranged from 3.9 to 31.25 mg dm-3 (Fig. 3). MBC/MFC

603

values against the mentioned microorganisms were equal or twice as high (<0.48–62.5 mg dm-

604

). These results indicate that 3Br, 3Asp and 3Ala demonstrate activity against pathogens at the
27

605

level of benzalkonium chloride, commonly applied as a potent disinfectant (Rzemieniecki et

606

al., 2019). Relatively low susceptibility to the tested dodecyl substituted QASs was noted only

607

in the case of C. albicans (MIC 15.62–62.5 mg dm-3, MFC 62.5–250 mg dm-3).

608

QASs with a short substituent (butyl or 2-hydroxyethyl) in the quinine-derived cation, on the

609

other hand, exhibited low antagonistic activity towards the tested microorganisms (MIC and

610

MBC/MFC up to above 1000 mg dm-3), comparable to that of pure quinine. On the other hand,

611

2Br, 2Asp and 2Ala comprising a medium-length substituent (octyl) in the cation showed

612

noticeable levels of activity toward most of the microorganisms tested, although they were less

613

active compared to their counterparts with a dodecyl substituent.

614

Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the length of the alkyl substituent and

615

the associated amphiphilicity of the quinine-based cation is the main factor affecting the level

616

of antibacterial activity. Hence, it can be stated that obtained compounds most likely exhibit

617

antimicrobial activity according to the same mechanism as other amphiphilic QASs (Tischer et

618

al., 2012) – this is also indicated by the higher susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to the

619

tested compounds compared to other groups of microorganisms. MIC and MBC/MFC values

620

were in the vast majority of cases independent of the chemical structure of the anion. Only in

621

the case of E. faecalis 2Asp and 2Ala were characterized by significantly reduced activity

622

compared to 2Br, but such differences were not observed between 3Asp or 3Ala, and 3Br.

623

Thus, it can be concluded that the strategy of introducing a non-toxic amino acid anion into

624

QASs does not cause significant changes in the antimicrobial activity of quinine-based salts.

625
626

3.5. Biopesticidal activity

627

Taking into account recent reports on the antifeedant activity of QASs comprising anions

628

derived from amino acids (Kaczmarek et al., 2024, 2022) and the confirmation of the

629

biopesticidal activity of quinine (Pernak et al., 2020), we analyzed the antifeedant properties of

the obtained bromides and amino acid salts comprising quinine-based cations toward adult

631

forms of granary weevil (S. granarius) and larvae of 2 species: confused flour beetle (T.

632

confusum) and khapra beetle (T. granarium). As in the case of antimicrobial activity tests,

633

quinine free base and quinine hydrochloride were used as reference substances. The results of

634

the tests are summarized in Fig. 4, while the exact values are summarized in Table A.5

635

(Supplementary Data).

Analysis of the results showed that the majority of the tested QASs exhibited good antifeedant

644

activity toward adult granary weevils as well as khapra beetle larvae, and very good activity

645

toward confused flour beetle larvae. A deviation from this rule was observed only in the case

646

of 4Br, 4Asp and 4Ala containing a 2-hydroxyl substituent, for which the total deterrence

647

coefficient T toward granary weevil showed values ranging from 81 to 99, comparable to the

29

648

values achieved for the reference compounds (95). 4Asp was further characterized by

649

significantly worse activity toward confused flour beetle larvae than the rest of the tested

650

compounds and reference substances. Also in our previous studies, we observed that excessive

651

hydrophilicity of the cation can negatively affect deterrent activity – choline analogs (Pernak et

652

al., 2007) and compounds containing hydroxyl (Stachowiak et al., 2020) or ester groups

653

(Kaczmarek et al., 2022) in the cations are generally characterized by worse T values compared

654

to QASs with cations based on synthetic surfactants with long alkyl chains (Niemczak et al.,

655

2019).

656

The introduction of an alkyl substituent into the quinine cation resulted in an increase in

657

antifeedant activity against adult granary weevils compared to the reference substances; for 5

658

QASs (2Br, 1Asp, 2Asp, 2Ala, 3Ala) the difference to the references was statistically

659

significant (Fig. 4). The length of the substituent in the 1-alkylquininium cation had no effect

660

on the performance of the compounds with bromide anion, while in the case of L-asparaginate

661

and L-alaninate, 2Asp and 2Ala containing an intermediate-length (octyl) substituent had the

662

best effect against adult weevils (T equal to 136 and 139, respectively). However, these results

663

were not significantly different from the T values determined for most compounds with either

664

butyl or dodecyl chains.

665

The antifeedant activity of the tested compounds toward larvae of khapra beetle (T. granarium)

666

was highly varied, with T values ranging from 45 (4Ala) to 169 (2Ala). In the case of this pest,

667

no clear dependence of biopesticidal activity on the type of cation or anion was observed.

668

Interestingly, an incidental, statistically significant increase in the activity was observed for

669

2Ala compared to the other salts. Like in the case of S. granarius, many of the quinine-based

670

QAS obtained were characterized by at least good antifeedant properties and showed

671

significantly better activity toward khapra beetle larvae compared to quinine hydrochloride (T

672

= 59). Interestingly, quinine in the form of the free base also demonstrated significantly better

673

activity toward khapra beetle (T = 121) compared to the hydrochloride form – such

674

discrepancies between the selected reference substances were not observed for the other species

675

tested.

676

With the exception of 4Asp, all quinine-based QASs showed very good (T > 150) antifeedant

677

properties toward confused flour beetle larvae regardless of the type of substituent in the cation

678

or anion structure (Fig. 4). This is most likely due to the very strong effect of quinine structure

679

on inhibiting the feeding of this species – the T value determined for quinine free base in

680

confused flour beetle tests was equal to 189. Thus, it can be concluded that the activity of

681

quinine against T. confusum larvae is comparable to that of azadirachtin (T = 192, see Fig. 4),

682

a substance known for its very potent biopesticidal properties. Although quinine is

683

characterized by potent antifeedant activity toward some mosquito species (Lukenge et al.,

684

2023), its activity toward stored product pests is reported to be significantly lower compared to

685

azadirachtin or neem oil formulations (Sanané et al., 2021). This is also true in the case of most

686

of the obtained quinine-based QASs, which did not reach the effectiveness of pure azadirachtin

687

(T = 194) to khapra beetles, and only 2Ala (T = 169) exhibited similar antifeedant activity

688

toward larvae of this species. In the case of adult granary weevils, the differences were even

689

more pronounced and pure azadirachtin (T = 190) was noticeably a superior feeding deterrent

690

than any of the quinine-based compounds tested. However, the very good antifeedant activity

691

of quinine (in the form of the free base and hydrochloride) toward T. confusum larvae, that also

692

determines high efficacy of the majority of quinine-based QASs, is a surprising result and

693

indicates the legitimacy of further research into the use of this alkaloid and its derivatives in the

694

protection of plants and seeds against pests. It should also be emphasized that despite the

695

exceptional biopesticidal activity of azadirachtin to a broad spectrum of stored product pests,

696

this substance cannot be profitably obtained by synthetic methods due to its complex chemical

697

structure (Jauch, 2008). In addition, azadirachtin is difficult to extract in large quantities from

31

698

Azadirachta indica plant matter which contributes to its high price. Therefore, the search for

699

feeding deterrents derived from other, more readily available natural resources remains a

700

legitimate approach. Moreover, given the high antimicrobial activity of salts 3Br, 3Asp, and

701

3Ala toward F. graminearum (a fungal pathogen of seeds and plants) and other microorganisms

702

(see Fig. 3), there is some potential for using the quinine-based QASs with longer alkyl

703

substituents for comprehensive biopesticidal protection of stored grain against both pest insects

704

and harmful plant pathogens. However, further research in this area needs to be preceded by

705

analyses of the toxicity of the new QASs, as well as their environmental fate and effects on

706

stored grain quality.

707
708

3.6. Phytotoxicity

709

Both the pesticide residues in the soil (Bragança et al., 2018) and the presence of antifeedant

710

on seeds (de Paulo Barbosa et al., 2023) may have a negative effect on plant germination and

711

development. Therefore, the effect of quinine-based QASs and a reference substance (quinine

712

hydrochloride) on seeds of a dicotyledonous (white mustard, S. alba) and a monocotyledonous

713

plant (sorghum, S. bicolor) was studied at different concentrations. The effect of the application

714

on the germination capacity of the plants is shown in Table A.6 (Supplementary Data), while

715

Fig. 5 shows the effect of the obtained compounds on the growth of shoots and roots of white

716

mustard. An analogous graph for sorghum (Fig. A.30) and a summary of the exact results of

717

the phytotoxicity tests (Tables A.7 and A.8) can be found in Supplementary Data.

721
722

Regardless of the chemical structure of the test compound, 80–100% of seeds of both plants

723

germinated after 96 h after treatment. This range coincides with the germination capacity of

724

untreated seeds according to the manufacturer's specifications. Thus, none of the applied QASs

725

or the reference formulation showed significant phytotoxicity at concentrations up to 10 g dm -

726

3

727

germination delays were observed during the experiment compared to the control.

728

Analysis of young white mustard plants revealed an interesting effect of the new quinine-based

729

QASs on the growth rate of roots and shoots (Fig. 5). At a concentration of 1 g dm-3, the tested

730

salts caused an increase in shoot length by 31–100% compared to the control, while roots were

731

elongated by 24–158%. 4Asp and 4Ala had the strongest stimulating effect on root growth, and

732

in their case the differences in white mustard root length (152% and 158%, respectively) were

733

statistically significant compared to the control. Regarding the shoot elongation, a significant

at the earliest stage of white mustard and sorghum development. Also, no significant

33

734

difference to the control was also recorded for 4Asp (100% increase). The beneficial effect of

735

4Asp and 4Ala may be due to the high hydrophilicity of these compounds (log KOW < -1), which

736

may positively influence the bioavailability of quinine-based cation in the soil. At the same

737

time, it should be remembered that the cation and anion of QASs behave differently in the soil

738

and their effects on plants should be considered separately (Homa et al., 2024). Given that 4Br

739

with the same cation stimulated root and shoot growth to a lesser extent, it can be predicted that

740

the plant growth-stimulating effect observed for 4Asp and 4Ala is a product of the beneficial

741

effect of the 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quinium cation and the enhancement of metabolism caused by

742

exogenous application of proteinogenic amino acids (Sowmya et al., 2023). It should also be

743

emphasized that the growth-stimulating activity of quinine in terrestrial plants has not yet been

744

studied in detail, and thus further research of this phenomenon is recommended.

745

At elevated concentrations (10 g dm-3), a difference in the effect of QASs with L-asparaginate

746

and L-alaninate anions was observed. The addition of 1Asp–4Asp continued to stimulate white

747

mustard root growth up to 79% compared to the control, although it did not stimulate shoot

748

elongation. In contrast, for compounds 1Ala–3Ala an inhibition of root (up to -43%) and shoot

749

growth (up to -28%) was observed. Conversely, the addition of 4Ala at 10 g dm-3 resulted in a

750

95% and 29% increase in root and stem length, respectively. The observed phenomenon can be

751

explained by the fact that L-alanine in high concentrations can cause phytotoxic effects in some

752

dicotyledonous plants (Alfosea-Simón et al., 2021).

753

In the case of young sorghum plants, the addition of quinine hydrochloride or quinine-based

754

QASs at a concentration of 10 g dm-3 or lower did not cause statistically significant changes in

755

root or shoot length compared to the control. Thus, no phytotoxic effect of the obtained

756

compounds was observed toward sorghum. Since growth inhibition was not observed at a

757

statistically significant level for white mustard either, it can be concluded that application of

758

the obtained QASs on the stored grain for pest protection will not cause phytotoxic effects.

However, more detailed studies on a wider spectrum of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous

760

plants are needed to assess the risk of quinine-derived biopesticides application in the

761

agrochemical operations.

3.7. Aquatic toxicity
3.7.1. Freshwater green algae (Chlorella vulgaris)

765

Proteinogenic amino acids are relatively harmless to many groups of aquatic organisms, and

766

their exogenous addition can have beneficial effects on algal growth. Among other things,

767

positive effects of amino acid addition have been observed on the increase in biomass of

768

freshwater algal cultures of C. vulgaris (Koochi et al., 2023). On the other hand, surface-active

769

QASs containing long alkyl substituents are characterized by high toxicity to aquatic organisms,

770

including microalgae (Zhu et al., 2010). This is due to the same mechanism of interaction with

771

cell membranes, which is responsible for the antibacterial activity of these compounds (Sanches

772

et al., 2023), as well as adverse interactions with organelles, including chloroplasts (Pawłowska

773

et al., 2019). Given the important role of algae as an essential source of food and oxygen in

774

aquatic biocoenoses, assessing toxicity of new chemicals to this group of organisms is important

775

in the course of the environmental risk analysis. According to the studies we performed on C.

776

vulgaris, the obtained quinine-based QASs are characterized by a diverse range of acute

777

toxicity. The estimated ErC50 values ranged from 0.1 (3Br, 3Asp, 3Ala) to more than 1000 mg

778

dm-3 (1Asp). The determined ErC50 ranges are summarized in Fig. 6, while the growth

779

inhibition values of C. vulgaris for the corresponding toxicant concentration are summarized in

780

Table A.9 (Supplementary Data).

786

Harbawi, 2014)

787
788

As in the case of antimicrobial activity, toxicity toward algae was determined by the type of

789

substituent in the quinine-derived cation. All compounds with a dodecyl substituent (3Br,

790

3Asp, 3Ala) exhibited the same ErC50 range (0.1–1 mg dm-3), comparable to the toxicity toward

791

C. vulgaris recorded for other QASs with a dodecyl chain, such as benzalkonium chloride

792

(ErC50: 0.22 mg dm-3) (Zhu et al., 2010) or salts with an imidazolium cation (0.37 mg dm-3)

793

(Zhang et al., 2017). No differences were also noticed between the toxicity of the 3 salts with

794

an octyl substituent (2Br, 2Asp, 2Ala, ErC50: 1–10 mg dm-3). It should therefore be

795

emphasized that optimization of the quinine-derived cation structure for antimicrobial activity

796

(especially in the case of 3Br, 3Asp and 3Ala) also leads to a significant increase in acute

797

toxicity against C. vulgaris, which presumably results from the analogous mechanism of action

798

of amphiphilic QASs against cells of both pathogenic microorganisms and algae (Sanches et

799

al., 2023). Thus, this means that despite their natural origin and enhanced biocompatibility,

800

potential quinine-based quaternary disinfectants containing a long alkyl substituent should still

801

be treated as a potential pollutant, and their release into the environment and concentration in

802

wastewater should be closely monitored analogously to “conventional” QASs of synthetic

803

origin (Arnold et al., 2023).

804

Compounds with a short butyl or 2-(hydroxyethyl) substituent were “practically nontoxic” (El-

805

Harbawi, 2014) and exhibited ErC50 values exceeding 100 mg dm-3. Thus, they were less toxic

806

than quinine hydrochloride (10–100 mg dm-3). Interestingly, a decrease in the toxicity against

807

C. vulgaris (ErC50 >1000 mg dm-3) to a level where the chemical can be considered “relatively

808

harmless” (El-Harbawi, 2014) was noted for 1Asp. Thus, it can be concluded that the

809

introduction of an amino acid anion into the structure of QASs could reduce the toxicity of the

810

quinine structure toward C. vulgaris in some cases, although it had no effect on reducing the

811

adverse effects caused by QASs comprising a quinine-based cation with a longer alkyl

812

substituent.

813
814

3.7.2. Freshwater crustaceans (Daphnia magna)

815

Freshwater crustaceans of the D. magna species are highly sensitive to the presence of a wide

816

range of chemicals in water, including cationic surfactants. QASs of synthetic origin such as

817

benzalkonium chloride, didecyldimethylammonium chloride or cetyltrimethylammonium

818

bromide are characterized by acute toxicity toward D. magna at very low concentrations (EC50

819

<0.1 mg dm-3) (Fuchsman et al., 2022; Homa et al., 2024; Nowacka et al., 2023), which qualifies

820

them in the “super toxic” category. This forces special caution in the disposal of conventional

821

disinfecting agents and prompts the search for active ingredients characterized by lower toxicity

822

to aquatic animals.

823

The acute toxicity analysis revealed that among the obtained quinine-based QASs, compounds

824

with cations containing either a short (1Br, 1Asp, 1Ala, 4Br, 4Asp, 4Ala) or a medium-length

825

(2Br, 2Asp, 2Ala) substituent were characterized by EC50 values against D. magna in the range

826

of 10–100 mg dm-3 (“slightly toxic”, Fig. 6). The harmful effect of the listed salts is presumably

37

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9146-0082 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

827

due to the aquatic toxicity of quinine, since the EC50 range estimated for the reference

828

compound (quinine hydrochloride) is identical. As with the toxicity analyses conducted for C.

829

vulgaris, extension of the alkyl chain to 12 carbon atoms resulted in a significant increase in

830

toxicity to crustaceans (EC50: 0.1–1 mg dm-3). These results indicate that 3Br, 3Asp and 3Ala

831

containing 1-dodecylquininium cation, which determines their potent antimicrobial properties

832

are at least moderately toxic to multiple classes of freshwater organisms and should be

833

thoroughly controlled as substances potentially hazardous to the aquatic environment in the

834

case of their potential application. However, quinine-based QASs with dodecyl substituent were

835

still less toxic than conventional QASs used in disinfectant formulations. The exact results of

836

the acute toxicity tests toward D. magna are summarized in Table A.10 (Supplementary Data).

837

Of all the compounds tested, 1Asp was characterized by good or very good antifeedant activity,

838

and its toxicity toward test organisms from a wide range of systematic groups (bacteria, fungi,

839

terrestrial plants, freshwater algae, freshwater crustaceans) was the lowest. Due to the low value

840

of log KOW (-0.91) it was also characterized by a low risk of bioaccumulation. Therefore, an

841

additional chronic toxicity study was conducted to determine the ability of D. magna to

842

reproduce in an environment contaminated with 1Asp at sublethal concentrations (≤ 10 mg dm-

843

3

844

The data obtained show that at low concentrations (0.01 mg dm-3 and 0.1 mg dm-3), 1Asp did

845

not affect the reproduction of D. magna females, and the number of parthenogenetic offspring

846

did not differ significantly from control organisms. Conversely, the applied QAS caused a

847

reduction in the number of offspring by an average of 48% as well as other adverse effects

848

(occurrence of aborted eggs and dead neonates) at a concentration of 1 mg dm-3, indicating the

849

presence of toxic effects. It should be noted that no relationship was observed between the

850

concentration of 1Asp and the mortality of D. magna; only four parent organisms (one in

). The results of the study are summarized in Fig A.31 and Table A.11 (Supplementary Data).

38

851

control, one at 0.01 mg dm-3, one at 1 mg dm-3, and one at 10 mg dm-3) died inadvertently

852

during the experiment.

853

Fascinatingly, increasing the concentration of 1Asp to sublethal levels (10 mg dm-3) did not

854

result in a further increase in toxicity toward D. magna, but instead caused a biostimulatory

855

effect. At the highest concentration of 1Asp tested, the reproductive output increased by 32%

856

compared to the control, and no mortality or signs of stress were observed during the test. This

857

unexpected phenomenon may stem from compensation for the toxic effects of 1-butylquininium

858

cation due to biostimulation induced by elevated concentrations of L-asparagine in the medium.

859

Despite the lack of data on the effect of exogenous addition of L-asparagine and other on D.

860

magna, there are reports that indicate a beneficial effect of proteinogenic amino acid addition

861

on the reproduction of the genetically similar Daphnia pulex (Fink et al., 2011). In the context

862

of this result, further, more thorough studies are warranted to test whether the addition of

863

proteinogenic amino acids can reduce the negative effects of chemicals exhibiting chronic

864

toxicity on aquatic crustaceans.

865
866

4. Conclusions

867

In this study, new naturally-derived quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) with quinine-based

868

cation and two amino acid anions: L-asparaginate and L-alaninate were obtained for the first

869

time using a sustainable, environmentally friendly synthesis method. and the acquired FT-IR

870

and NMR spectra allowed confirmation of their chemical structures. The new compounds

871

exhibited many times higher solubility in water compared to known 1-alkylquininium

872

bromides. The antimicrobial activity of the analyzed quinine-based QASs increased with the

873

elongation of the alkyl chain in the cation, and the chemical structure of an anion had no

874

influence on this effect. The 1-dodecylquinium salts inhibited the growth of most of the

875

microbes tested at concentrations below 16 mg dm-3, thus showing activity at the level of

39

876

commercially available disinfectants. Most quinine derivatives also proved to be good or very

877

good feeding deterrents active toward stored product pests, particularly effective against T.

878

confusum larvae. In view of this high activity, and due the low availability and high price of the

879

most effective natural antifeedants for storage pests (i.e. azadirachtin), further research to

880

determine the optimal chemical structure and dose of quinine-based QASs to achieve optimal

881

biopesticidal activity is warranted.

882

No significant phytotoxic effects were observed for any of the tested compounds in

883

concentrations below 10 mg dm-3, which is a promising preliminary result in the context of the

884

potential application of new compounds. Interestingly, although QASs with an amino acid

885

anion and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium cation were characterized by weak antifeedant activity

886

and had no antimicrobial properties, their application on seeds caused accelerated growth of

887

white mustard plants compared to the control. This result implies the potential use of more

888

hydrophilic forms of quinine-based QASs. As with conventional QASs, the aquatic toxicity of

889

the analyzed quinine derivatives was related to the length of the alkyl substituent in the cation.

890

Despite the lack of clear toxicity of salts with 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)quininium and 1-

891

butylquininium cations toward algae (ErC50 > 100 mg dm-3), QASs containing a longer alkyl

892

chain were moderately or highly toxic toward C. vulgaris. Toxicity toward D. magna was

893

mainly due to the adverse effects of quinine. An additional chronic toxicity test against D.

894

magna, performed for the least harmful QAS with a 1-butylquinium cation and an L-

895

asparaginate anion, showed no long-term effects at concentrations of 0.1 mg dm-3 and below.

896

Surprisingly, at sublethal concentration (10 mg dm-3), inhibition of the chronic toxicity of this

897

salt and positive effects on the reproduction of test organisms were observed.

898

The results of the conducted studies indicate that quinine is an interesting raw material for the

899

synthesis of new biologically active compounds, and its quaternary salts containing short alkyl

900

substituents exhibit low or mild toxicity to microbes, terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms.

901

In addition, they are effective biopesticides that prevent stored product pests from feeding with

902

moderate or high efficiency. Moreover, the elongation of the alkyl chain in the quinine-derived

903

cation, allows for synthesis of new QASs with potent disinfectant properties, albeit at the

904

expense of their increased toxicity to aquatic organisms. Therefore, it should be emphasized

905

that quinine-based cations that determine antimicrobial activity are also toxic to multiple classes

906

of aquatic organisms and, despite their higher biocompatibility, should be treated as emerging

907

pollutants like conventional QAS disinfectants currently in use. From the above, it also follows

908

that new QASs such as 1-butylquininium

909

microorganisms and low-toxic, but with favorable antifeedant activity – offer a potentially safer

910

alternative as dedicated biopesticides in applications where the disinfectant activity of new

911

QASs is not required.
