Abstract

we explored uronium as a sensitive and robust reagent cation for ionizing moderately polar, basic, and neutral compounds at ambient pressure. Urea, a solid chemical safe to
humans with negligible vapor pressure under
normal circumstances, is desorbed by x-ray irradiation, forming the uronium ion. We experimentally determined the calibration factors
and behavior under different humidities for several semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs),
amines, and ammonia, and explored the ionization characteristics using theory. In laboratory measurements of α-pinene and dimethyl
sulfide (DMS) oxidation systems we characterized how uronium chemical ionization complements other ionization. Beyond excellent sensitivities to several key components (including
amines, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pyridine,
N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), verbenone and
dimethylformamide (DMF)) allowing detection

The vast chemical diversity of compounds relevant for gas-phase molecular analytics necessitates the combination of complimentary ionization approaches optimized for specific classes
to enable comprehensive mass spectrometric
detection. For the ionization of weakly polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chemical ionization at low pressure (e.g. protonor charge-transfer) is more suitable. Negative mode ionization at ambient pressure has
delivered superior performance for moderately
and highly polar acidic compounds. Numerous alternative positive mode ionization techniques have been explored to detect basic and
polar neutral compounds, for which negative
polarity and low-pressure ionization techniques
have shown insufficient performance. Several ion attachment reagents, such as ammonia and amines, have been previously proposed
for more sensitive and soft ionization at ambient and reduced pressures. However, these
reagents are often reactive, toxic, and difficult to control, impeding their applicability
and operability. Inspired by these challenges,

CIMS lies in the trivial handling of the reagent
supply and long-term stability of the ion production system. Overall, uronium CIMS represents an innovative technique with significant
potential for standardization and wide applicability, given its demonstrated detection efficiency that complements negative mode and
low-pressure ionization techniques, safety, and
low maintenance requirements.

tive, these reagents are reactive, hazardous, and
difficult to control, limiting their applicability.
Müller et al. 21 have developed a novel lowpressure ammonium generation method that
does not require the provision of ammonia, reducing the risks related to corrosion and toxicity. Still, the method does not fully meet the requirements for accurate and sensitive measurements. One of the limiting factors for the ammonium ionization scheme is the small size of
the primary ion, which presents challenges related to ion transmission in the mass spectrometer, limiting the control and quantification capabilities of these CI systems. 22 In addition, the
common method of providing ammonia in an
aqueous solution is prone to drift, affecting the
primary ion distribution and consequently altering the ionization regime. 19,23 Despite these
limitations, ammonium CIMS garnered significant interest due to its ability to cluster with
a wide range of compounds, providing complementary capabilities to conventional PTR-MS
and negative mode CIMS. Motivated by these
challenges and the need for a holistic analysis
of gas-phase species, we set out to find a better alternative for positive mode ion attachment
ionization targeting SVOCs, in particular moderately polar, lowly oxygenated, and basic compounds. The result of this exploration is the
discovery of the uronium chemical ionization.
Urea (NH2 C(O)NH2 ), is a simple yet remarkable organic compound, known for its biological, chemical, and industrial relevance. Urea
became the first organic compound synthesized from inorganic substances by Friedrich
Wöhler 24 in 1828, challenging the vitalism theory of organic chemistry and marking the advent of modern organic synthesis. 25 Urea is a
well-known hydrogen bond donor that forms
strong eutectic mixtures with a variety of compounds. 26 Structurally, urea is composed of two
amino groups (−NH2 ) attached to a central carbonyl group (C−O), a configuration that imparts high polarity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds. This molecular arrangement renders urea highly soluble in water, facilitating its
natural occurrence in biological systems as the
principal nitrogenous waste product of protein
metabolism in mammals. Synthesized in the

Introduction
Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry
(CIMS) is an essential analytical technique for
the direct gas-phase analysis of a wide range of
compounds in multiple applications including
industrial process control, 1 air quality monitoring, 2 food science, 3 medical research, 4 and
atmospheric science. 5 Multiple customized approaches have been developed in pursuit of
the efficient detection of the vast spectrum of
molecules that exist in the gas phase. The
polarity, 6 pressure, 7 temperature, 8,9 and electronic structural features 10 of the reagent ions
define the dimensionality of the chemical ionization (CI) regimes, resulting in a specific
selectivity and sensitivity profile of a given ionization scheme for particular compounds.
Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry
(PTR-MS) using hydronium as a reagent ion
at low pressure has become a widely adopted
technique for analysing VOCs. 11 While it is an
excellent analysis tool for less polar and more
volatile molecules, it is, by nature, less selective
and more fragmenting towards more functionalized species. 12–14 Polar acidic and highly oxygenated species are best detected by negativemode chemical ionization, such as nitrate, bromide, and iodide CIMS. 15–18 A number of techniques have been proposed for the sensitive
detection of several SVOCs, often constituting lowly oxygenated, moderately polar, and
basic molecules – compound classes for which
PTR-MS and negative mode ion attachment
techniques exhibit reduced sensitivity. The
most notable methods are ammonium 19 and
aminium 6,20 CIMS. While versatile and sensi2

liver, it provides a non-toxic mechanism for ammonia excretion, underscoring its critical role in
maintaining nitrogen balance in living organisms. 27
To the best of our knowledge, despite its
emblematic role in science and nature and its
favorable electronic structure, urea has never
been tried as a CIMS reagent. The main challenge to overcome in the current work was to
produce a sufficient gas-phase concentration of
urea, a compound with negligible vapor pressure. The solution we found was x-ray desorption of solid-phase urea at room temperature. This novel method allowed us to create a
sufficient number of uronium cations to act as
CI reagent ions in a controlled and sustainable
manner. To explore the suitability of uronium
as a CI reagent we conducted a series of experiments to determine the sensitivity and stability
of ionization reactions to a range of chemical
compounds in varied humidities. Experiments
were supported by quantum chemical studies to
elucidate these reactions from a theoretical perspective. To explore the complementarity of the
uronium to other CI reagents we performed series of VOC oxidation experiments using MultiPressure Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MPCIMS). 7 To validate the applicability of
the method for the detection of ammonia in ambient air measurements, we performed a sideby-side comparison with a dedicated quantum
cascade tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectrometer (QC-TILDAS, Aerodyne
Research Inc.) widely used for quantification of
atmospheric ammonia. 28

Figure 1 shows the geometry of the way solid
urea was provided to the ionization volume.
High-purity urea (VWR Chemicals, analytical
reagent grade) is deposited into a custom-made
holder (polyether ether ketone, PEEK) which is
placed between MION2 electrodes exposing it
to x-rays. The physical process of how urea is
understood to sublimate is discussed in the Results and Discussion section. An electric field
transports the ions into the ambient pressure
ion-molecule reactor (IMR). The reagent gas in
the ionized volume is kept apart from the sample gas by auxiliary gas flows. The reaction
time within the IMR is approximately 25 ms.
The sample gas then enters the Orbitrap mass
spectrometer through a heated capillary (inner
diameter 0.58 mm, length 58 mm). The capillary temperature was kept at 300 ◦ C. Data
were analysed with the Orbitool software package. 32 For VOC oxidation experiments, the ionization schemes were cycled between uronium
(NH2 C(O)NH3+ ), nitrate (NO3 – ), and fluoranthenium ions(C16 H10+ ) to assess the complete
gas-phase product distribution. 7

institute. Ambient air was sampled to the uronium CIMS through a makeshift inlet (4 m long
10 mm inner diameter PTFE tubing) from the
window of a laboratory located in the suburbs
of Helsinki, Finland. At the end of the ambient measurements, both instruments sampled
indoor (laboratory) air for a few hours, during which ammonia was also evaporated from a
cloth to explore the response to higher concentrations.

Measurement data
Quantum chemical calculations

This study generated data for calibration purposes, as well as data from laboratory flow reactor experiments aiming at α-pinene and DMS
oxidation products, and observations from ambient field measurements.
The sensitivity of uronium for the detection
of a number of compounds was determined in a
set of calibration experiments that used a liquid
calibration unit (LCU, Ionicon Analytik 37 ). In
the apparatus, dilute aqueous analyte solutions
are sprayed into a heated chamber (110 ◦ C) and
carried by a carrier flow (1 lpm) into the main
sample flow (20 lpm). Solutions were prepared
in water, to avoid potential interferences from
solvents such as e.g. methanol. Multi-point calibrations were carried out under varying degrees
of humidification, from dry (RH< 5%) up to
80% relative humidity, and dosing levels varying by up to a factor of 30 (Fig. S1).
To create a spectrum of compounds with variable degree of oxidation, qualitative α-pinene
oxidation experiments were carried out in a
flow tube reactor (reaction time 6 s) under nearambient conditions. A-pinene vapors were obtained by bubbling inert nitrogen through a liquid reservoir. Ozone was generated from synthetic air via UV light irradiation.
DMS oxidation experiments employed the
same flow tube apparatus as the α-pinene experiments. DMS was dosed from a bottle (Air
Products, 100 ppmv). Ethylene was added as
dry OH source, and ozone was generated from
synthetic air via UV light irradiation.
To evaluate the quantification capabilities under ambient conditions, we performed a sideby-side comparison with a dedicated ammonia

To explore the energetics of uronium ionization,
several calculations were performed. The stabilities of ionic adducts of compounds listed in
Table S1 with protonated urea (CO(NH2 )2 H+ )
along with their respective tendencies to protonate, were examined using computational
quantum chemical methods. A systematic conformational search was done using the MMFF
molecular mechanics method in the Spartan ’24
program (Wavefunction, Inc). Single-point energies were computed at the B3LYP/6-31+G*
level 38–40 for all conformers using Spartan ’24,
and those within 5 kcal mol−1 in electronic energies of the lowest-energy conformer were
considered for geometry optimizations. Geometry optimizations were first carried out
at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory and
subsequently at ωB97X-D/6-31+G* (with
frequency calculations) 41 for the conformers
within 2 kcal mol−1 in electronic energies of the
lowest-energy conformer. The energies of the
lowest energy conformers were further refined
at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP level
of theory. These geometry optimizations and
frequency calculations were performed with the
Gaussian 16 program, 42 while the ORCA 5.0.3
program 43 was used for DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations.
As the hydrogen bonding sites are less obvious for the iodine-containing systems, a different approach was adopted to find their lowest energy clusters with uronium. The partial
atomic charges for all iodine molecules and uronium were calculated with Gaussian 16 using
the Pop=MKUFF keyword at the M062X/aug4

cc-pVTZ-(PP) level of theory. Iodine pseudopotentials were taken from the EMSL basis
set library. 44,45 The atomic charges were then
used for conformational sampling where the
molecules were treated as rigid (intramolecular bonds and angles between bonds remain
fixed) using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
algorithm implemented in the ABCluster program. 46–48 The following values were used for
key parameters, pop = 1000, gen = 100,
−lm = 3000. The resulting structures were
then first optimized using semiempirical xTB
method with “vTight” criteria. 49–51 The structures were then filtered to remove duplicates,
as described in Kubečka et al. 47 . The resulting structures were first optimized at the
M062X/SDD level of theory, and then at the
M062X/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level of theory on the
subset of molecules within 5 kcal mol−1 of the
lowest energy geometry in relative electronic
energies. Finally, the energies of the lowest
energy molecules were refined at the DLPNOCCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP level of theory using
ORCA program, which were used to calculate
the cluster binding enthalpies.

Results and discussion
Generation of uronium ions
The saturation vapor pressure of urea is very
low, at room temperature only about 10−8 atm
(Fig. S5). Experimentally, uronium ions are observed only if some of the (solid) urea is illuminated by the x-ray charger (Fig. 1). Providing urea vapors conventionally from a reservoir
of solid urea in an external reagent vial does
not create any uronium signal, not even if the
length of lines are minimized and ample time
(one week) is dedicated for conditioning. On
the other hand, if urea is introduced into a clean
MION2 ion source and exposed to x-rays, the
uronium signal appears instantaneously.
The exact mechanism by which urea sublimates to the gas phase is not clear, e.g., it
is not clear whether neutral urea, uronium, or
urea radicals evaporate. The enthalpy of sublimation of urea is approximately 95 kJ mol−1 ,

exchange reaction U · U · H+ + H2 O −−→
U + U · H2 O · H+ (here, U denominates urea)
is energetically not favorable (enthalpy difference 14.6 kcal mol−1 ) but still relevant given the
sheer abundance of water.
Figure 2c shows the remarkable long-term stability of uronium generation over more than
2 months. Without any retuning or resupply
of reagent, neither the monomer nor the dimer
abundance deviated more than 10% from the
average. The result is a testament to the low
evaporation rate, even in the presence of constant x-ray irradiation. The robust operation
without the need for daily or even monthly
maintenance should not only facilitate easier
deployments but — by introducing less changes
— also improve the quality of acquired data.

or 1 eV. 52 X-ray ionization kicks out electrons
from their orbital. Relaxation of the atom to
a lower electronic state releases energy (typically multiple eV) for evaporation to occur. 53–56
This is similar to Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), although the exact
mechanism of volatilization and charging remain unknown. 57 We conclude that x-ray irradiation is required to induce significant sublimation of urea and the generation of uronium
ions. 58,59
We tested the approach to generate reagent
ions from solids different than urea. The x-ray
irradiation of ammonium nitrate salts also produces nitrate ions. 53 Here, the relative abundance of the nitrate dimer appears to be lower
than when nitrate is formed from the irradiation of nitric acid vapors, provided from a liquid
reservoir. At the same time, the intensity of the
monomer ion was enhanced. This is consistent
with a lower effective vapor concentration of nitric acid. The shifted distribution of the reagent
ion using x-ray desorption might be exploited
to enhance the sensitivity of nitrate chemical
ionization to specific compound classes. 15 The
mechanism of ion production from a solid precursor substance appears to be not limited to
urea, and is warranted to be explored further.
Figure 2a shows the mass spectrum in the
absence of analytes. Uronium and the urea–
uronium cluster are the only dominant peaks.
The observation of the dimer and oligomers is
similar to that of other ionization approaches
−
(NO−
3 , Br , etc.). The uronium–water peak
was only observed at trace intensities at high
RH (1000 cps or 10−4 ncps at 80% RH). This
is consistent with a relatively low binding enthalpy between uronium and water (see below
the theoretical analysis). The abundance of
contaminant peaks is low, with contaminants
not exceeding 5·10−3 relative intensity (Fig. 2a)
when analytical grade urea is used.
The sensitivity of the abundance of reagent
ions to changes in humidity is shown in Fig. 2b.
The abundance of the monomer is essentially
constant. The abundance of the dimer decreases by approximately 50% when going from
dry to wet conditions (80% RH). Between 20%
and 80% RH the decrease is only 20%. The

in Table S1. The protonation of urea occurs
preferentially at the carbonyl group as the resulting cation is 16.02 kcal mol−1 lower in enthalpy compared to the cation with the proton
on the nitrogen atom. The calculated proton
affinity is 209.85 kcal mol−1 (compare literature
value of 208.8 kcal mol−1 60 and an estimated
1.6 kcal mol−1 error margin for the DLPNOCCSD(T) method in predicting binding enthalpies 61 ) and the dipole moment is 2.34 D
– ammonium, in contrast, does not possess a
net dipole moment. The most stable analyteuronium cluster geometries contain hydrogen
bond interactions from the carbonyl and at
least one amino group of uronium. Analytes
with multiple polar functional groups may exhibit interactions to multiple groups, e.g., triethylene glycol (Fig. 3), syringol, or glyoxal.
The interaction of uronium connected to two
functional groups distinguishes it from e.g. ammonium, where only one significant interaction
is established. The affinities of uronium to form
a cluster are generally slightly stronger than
those of ammonium (Table S1 and Xu et al. 23 ),

due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen
compared to nitrogen. As a result, uronium
clusters tend to be more stable and protonation
by uronium is less likely.
Small molecular clusters with less than about
8 atoms are likely not efficiently collisionally
stabilized during ionization, leading to lower
instrument sensitivities despite strong binding
enthalpies. 17,62 For example, the chemical ionization of IO by bromide or nitrate is not as
efficient as that of e.g. sulfuric acid. 63 The substantial number of atoms of uronium should
make it a better reagent ion to detect small
molecules like IO. However, the calculated binding enthalpies of IO and other iodine oxidation
products were found to be unfavorably low (Table S1).
Figure 4 shows the calculated enthalpies for
different clusters against fragmentation into
uronium and the analyte. The enthalpies are
shown here because they were shown to better predict ionization efficiencies than free energies. 62 Higher binding enthalpies generally lead
to higher chances of ionization, as long as the

system size allows sufficient dissipation of energy. 17,62
The enthalpy for uronium to cluster with urea
to form the UUH+ dimer ion (35.16 kcal mol−1 ,
Fig. 3e) influences to what extent the dimer
participates in the formation of analyte–
uronium clusters. Due to the strong binding enthalpy of the uronium–urea cluster, it forms stable reagent ion dimers under our experimental
conditions. The ionization of an analyte then
happens through a ligand exchange reaction,
where analyte–uromium clusters with binding enthalpies in excess of 35.16 kcal mol−1 are
more efficiently ionized than the more weakly
bound clusters. Importantly, the binding enthalpy between uronium and water is relatively
low (20.56 kcal mol−1 ), such that the reagent
ion is not strongly interacting with water, and
humidity sensitivities are minor.
Another route for newly formed clusters is the
fragmentation into neutral urea and protonated
analyte. This is more likely for compounds with
high proton affinity. The energetics of the uronium proton transfer reactions were determined
for different compounds and are illustrated in
Fig. S6, showing trends and outliers within different compound classes. The extent to which
the fragmentation occurs depends on the energies, the distribution of energy within the cluster, and the dissipation of excess energy to the
bath gas. The initial interaction between uronium and analyte determines the overall likelihood for ionization.
The trend of increasing binding enthalpies for
e.g. the amines is the combined result of the
changing dipole moment and the ability of the
larger molecules to adapt energetically favorable configurations. In case of diisopropylamine
(Fig. 3b), the two methyl groups with net positive charge provide steric hindrance and make
the uronium ion bond with the NH group less
favorable. However, the proton affinity of diisopropylamine is very high (232.5 kcal mol−1 64 ),
resulting in excellent detection in its protonated
form.

sible that water could help in the ionization of
small molecules via sacrificial cooling. 66
Table 1 summarizes the experimental sensitivities. The detection limits attainable with
uronium are in the parts per trillion per volume (pptv) to parts per quadrillion per volume
(ppqv) range, as combination of uronium’s favorable tendency to interact with the analytes
and the maximized opportunity for ionization
to occur during the relatively long reaction time
(approximately 25 ms) under ambient pressure.
For this reason, these detection limits are of
similar magnitude as e.g. those attainable for
sulfuric acid using a nitrate CIMS. In absolute
terms, at maximum sensitivity, as few as 10 attomoles are required to produce 100 counts, the
lowest detectable signal.
The sensitivity to DMSO was characterized to
be very high, with respective detection limits in
the ppqv range. This is particularly interesting
in light of the importance of atmospheric DMS
oxidation, which, by forming sulfuric acid, is
a globally important driver of particle formation. The details of the oxidation mechanism,
e.g., the branching of pathways, are still being investigated. 67,68 Beyond DMSO, clusters of
uronium with DMSO2 were apparently also observed in exploratory flow tube experiments of
DMS oxidation. However, accurate calibration
factors could not be produced due to the lack
of calibration standards.
The sensitivity to amines is likewise favorably
high, both for detection as cluster with uronium
or as protonated molecule. In our oxidizing atmosphere that promotes the formation of acids,
amines are important to atmospheric aerosol
particle formation. 69,70 Ammonia, the isolated
functional amino group, is only detected as cluster with uronium, due to the minute mass of
ammonium. The amines (larger than methylamine) are also detected in their protonated
form. It might be considered a happy coincidence that the sensitivity to the tested amines
is approximately inverse to their atmospheric
abundance, i.e., the sensitivity to the relatively
common ammonia is lower than e.g. dimethylamine. One could also argue that less interacting, more volatile gases should occur at higher
abundance. Regardless, the trend in sensitivity,

Figure 5 shows the measured calibration factors derived from the multi-point calibrations
under varied humidity (see Methods) for the
different compounds on the left axis, while the
right axis indicates the respective limits of detection, estimated as the volume mixing ratio
corresponding to the assumed lowest detectable
peak intensities of 100 cps. All signals are normalized by the sum of the uronium monomer
and dimer ion. The abscissa is the calculated
binding enthalpy of the uronium–analyte cluster, the energy associated with the first interaction between the analyte and uronium. The
markers indicate the calibration factor for detection as cluster (blue hourglass) or protonated
analyte (red circle). The dashed grey lines connect the two respective experimental calibration factors via the binding enthalpy of the cluster against fragmentation into the protonated
analyte and neutral urea. The uronium-analyte
clusters tend to fragment into the protonated
analyte and neutral urea if energetically favorable. In this case, the detection of a target compound via the protonated analyte yields better
sensitivity. For example, the fragmentation of
the uronium–trimethylamine cluster into urea
and trimethylaminium is favorable by about
15 kcal mol−1 , and trimethylamine is mostly detected as trimethylaminium. Vice versa, triethylene glyocol is mostly detected as cluster
with uronium. As expected from theory, higher
sensitivities are found for larger binding enthalpies. 62 Acetone is detected with a surprisingly low sensitivity, which we speculate to originate from some sort of reactive interaction between acetone and urea. 65
Figure 5 further illustrates the humidity sensitivity of the calibration factors, a known feature to different ionization schemes. In case
of ammonia, one compound exhibiting a more
pronounced sensitivity, the calibration factor
varies by a factor 5, requiring proper account
of changes in humidity during measurements.
Most of the other compounds tested exhibit a
calibration factor that varies not more than a
few 10%. While a clear trend is lacking in the
limited set of compounds tested, it seems plau9

in line with binding enthalpies, is welcome.
The chemical ionization of amines has been
previously accomplished by proton-transfer reactions 71–74 . Nowak et al. 75 ,76 pioneered the
detection of ammonia by ethanol CIMS 77 , and
developed an improved CIMS employing acetone dimers for the detection of ammonia. 78,79
Protonated ethanol or acetone ions were later
also used as ionization reagents to also selectively detect other high proton affinity base
compounds (e.g. amines and ammonia 80,81 ).
Sipilä et al. 82 explored dosing sulfuric acid in
an NO−
3 CIMS for the detection of ammonia
and amines via clustering with the bisulfate
ion. However, operational complexities of these
prior CIMS approaches have hampered their
adoption by the general atmospheric CIMS
community. We believe that the robust operation of the uronium CIMS facilitates routine
measurements of amines, thereby better constraining atmospheric particle formation.

abundances of ammonia in atmospheric measurements. In absence of a dedicated NH3 free
overflow system, the instrument background of
the CIMS measurement was accounted for by
subtracting the lowest normalized signal intensity observed during the observations. The
intensity of the detected peak was scaled by
a humidity-dependent calibration factor (8.6 ·
10−7 ncps pptv−1 for the moist ambient measurements and 6.2 · 10−7 ncps pptv−1 for the
drier indoor measurements). The thusly baseline corrected and scaled time series (1 min averages) are shown in Figure 6 (red markers)
along with the QC-TILDAS time series. Volume mixing ratios ranged from a few 10s of pptv
to single ppbv during the ambient measurements, to 3 ppbv indoor VMR and peaking at
around 100 ppbv in the spiked experiment.
The ratio of VMRs measured by the uronium CIMS and QC-TILDAS is generally unity
within a maximum deviation of a few 10%. The
fairly long CIMS inlet line used for the comparison limits the temporal response to changes
in NH3 abundance. Differences in line conditioning hamper the direct comparison of the
data during the transients of the laboratory ex-

Figure 6: Ammonia and amine abundance in ambient and laboratory air. On Feb 26, ammonia
was evaporated into the laboratory to test the response to high VMR. The uronium CIMS derived
ammonia time series agrees well with the QC-TILDAS-determined time series. Methylamine is only

periment, but it appears that there is a good
correlation across at least 2 orders of magnitude in abundance, from several 10s of pptv
to several ppbv. Determining the NH3 instrument baseline was hampered by the absence of
a dedicated ambient sampling inlet and lack of
ammonia scrubber, and would be required for
the accurate determination of absolute ammonia concentrations in independent deployments
of a uronium CIMS that lack the luxury of a reference instrument. Determining the NH3 baseline is notoriously difficult, reflected in the fact
that QC-TILDAS is dedicating 30% of the time
to assessing the instrument background, sampling from zero air every 15 min. Overall, the
comparison shows that uronium CIMS can be
used to measure atmospheric bases, and given
even higher sensitivities, it should provide an
excellent handle on other amines.
Figure 6 further shows the timeseries of
methylamine (CH3 NH2 ), C2 H6 NH (dimethylamine), and C3 H9 N (trimethylamine). The
time series were scaled with the laboratory derived calibration factors and corrected for the
respective instrument background by subtracting the lowermost value of the time series,
equivalent as for ammonia. The thusly determined volume mixing ratios are in the sub-pptv
range for ambient measurements, and pptvs for
indoor air. Methylamine is only detected during the spike experiments, somewhat in con-

trast to the expectation of observing it at abundances higher than other amines. 69,83 The separation of isomers (e.g., by gas chromatography)
would be required to positively attribute the
detected peaks of the larger amines to the different isomers, but should be possible given the
very low detection limits.

Laboratory α-pinene experiments
Figure 7 shows the capability of uronium to ionize organic molecules in the α-pinene oxidation
experiments relative to nitrate and fluoranthenium ionization in a Kendrick and a van Krevelen diagram. Nitrate chemical ionization is
well known to be selective to highly oxygenated
compounds. 84 Low-pressure positive ionization
(e.g. PTR) creates sensitivity to lowly or nonoxygenated volatile compounds. Here, fluoranthenium was used to detect α-pinene, the
non-oxidized precursor and other reaction products. 7 Uronium positive mode at ambient pressure bridges the gap between these two schemes
and extends the sensitivity to lowly oxygenated
compounds. Figure 7 reinforces that the chemical variety of trace gases requires the use of
different ionization schemes across polarity and
pressure to attain comprehensive detection sensitivity.

and intensities of compounds with varying number of oxygen atoms detected during α-pinene
oxidation experiments using nitrate, uronium and fluoranthenium ionization (blue, red, yellow

Multiple ionization schemes are needed to create sensitivity to the chemically varied spectrum of
volatile (precursor) gases and oxidized reaction products.

Conclusions

sic compounds including ammonia and amines
— compounds that are notoriously difficult to
measure — facilitates the enhanced and more
routine assessment of bases in ambient CIMS
deployments. The sensitivity range synergizes
with that of low-pressure positive and ambientpressure negative ionization, enabling a nearcomplete coverage with just one mass spectrometer. 6,7
Another benefit of uronium ionization over
similar approaches, e.g., ammonium ionization,
is the alleviation of several operational challenges, specifically the robust and stable provision of ions, the possible normalization due to
its moderate mass, and the easy and safe operation. Because of the negligible vapor pressure,
contaminating the instrument with the reagent,
a common hazard with nitric acid and ammonia, is also obviated.
In addition, we have successfully tested
the x-ray irradiation of ammonium nitrate, a
solid with a vapor pressure similar to that of
urea, 85,86 for the generation of nitrate reagent
ions. Lower nitric acid and higher nitrate concentrations might allow optimizing the sensitivity of nitrate CIMS to a broader range of
compounds. 15
Overall, we believe that the method of xray reagent desorption in general, and uronium

Uronium CIMS and means of providing reagent
precursor via x-ray desorption of solids is a new
approach for sensitive analysis of complex gas
mixtures. We inspected uronium’s applicability as a reagent ion through series of laboratory experiments, featuring multi-point calibrations to several compounds of interest in wide
range of humidities. The interpretation of the
experimental results was supported by theoretical study including quantum chemical computations of reaction thermodynamics between
uronium and analytes under investigation. To
assess the complementarity of uronium to lowpressure and negative mode ionization schemes
we conducted series of α-pinene and DMS oxidation experiments yielding a wide range of reaction products of different volatilities using an
MPCIMS system. To test the applicability of
uronium CIMS for the quantification of trace
gases in demanding applications, we conducted
ambient measurements alongside QC-TILDAS,
a standard technique for atmospheric ammonia
measurements.
The ability of uronium to selectively form
strong clusters and the resulting applicability
in ambient-pressure IMRs create excellent sensitivities to several key compound classes. The
exceptional sensitivity of uronium CIMS to ba12

chemical ionization in particular, can improve
the operability of CIMS, enhance its performance for gas-phase analytics in atmospheric
and environmental research, and pave the way
towards its standardization and wider use in industrial applications.

lines indicate is the volume mixing ratio equivalent to the instrument background (if present)
when the inlet is overflowed with pure nitrogen. The diamond marker indicate the detection limit
calculated as three times the standard deviation of a the instrument background (if present). Lastly,
the hexagonal marker is the volume mixing ratio equivalent to 100 cps signal, the approximately
