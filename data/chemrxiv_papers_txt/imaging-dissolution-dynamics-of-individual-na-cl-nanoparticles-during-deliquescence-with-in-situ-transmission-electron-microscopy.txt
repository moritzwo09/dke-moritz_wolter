Abstract
Water vapor condensation on hygroscopic aerosol particles plays an important role in cloud
formation, climate change, secondary aerosol formation, and aerosol aging. Conventional
understanding considers deliquescence of nanosized hygroscopic aerosol particles a nearly
instantaneous solid to liquid phase transition. However, the nanoscale dynamics of water
condensation and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence remain obscure
due to a lack of high spatial and temporal resolution single particle measurements. Here we use
real time in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of individual sodium chloride
(NaCl) nanoparticles to demonstrate that water adsorption and aerosol particle dissolution prior to
and during deliquescence is a multistep dynamic process. Water condensation and aerosol particle
dissolution was investigated for lab generated NaCl aerosols and found to occur in three distinct
stages as a function of increasing RH. First, a < 100 nm water layer adsorbed on the NaCl cubes
and caused sharp corners to dissolve and truncate. The water layer grew to several hundred
nanometers with increasing RH and was rapidly saturated with solute, as evidenced by halting of
particle dissolution. Adjacent cube corners displayed second-scale curvature fluctuations with no
net particle dissolution or water layer thickness change. We propose that droplet solute
concentration fluctuations drove NaCl transport from regions of high local curvature to regions of
low curvature. Finally, we observed coexistence of a liquid water droplet and aerosol particle
immediately prior to deliquescence. Particles dissolved discretely along single crystallographic
directions, separating by few second lag times with no dissolution. This work demonstrates that
deliquescence of simple pure salt particles with sizes in the range of 100 nm to several microns is
not an instantaneous phase transition and instead involves a range of complex dissolution and
water condensation dynamics.

Introduction
Nanosized hygroscopic particles provide nucleation sites for water condensation and
droplet growth. Droplet formation involves deliquescence, the phase transition from a solid aerosol
to a nano-sized liquid water droplet, followed by spontaneous growth into a micron sized droplet.
Atmospheric aerosol particles derive from human activities, including stack emissions, vehicle
exhaust, and pesticides, and the natural environment, such as sea spray, dust, and forest fires.1
These particles undergo a series of complex reactions and eventually form cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN), which interact with water molecules in the atmosphere and significantly impact both
climate and human health.2-6 For instance, CCN concentration impacts cloud structure, which
influences Earth's energy balance through albedo, lifetime modulation, and precipitation, playing
a crucial role in climate regulation. Additionally, the interaction of respiratory microdroplets
carrying pathogens with water vapor impacts respiratory disease transmission.7 Understanding the
interaction of aerosol particles with water vapor is therefore vital to establish accurate models for
precipitation, climate change, and aerosol disease transmission.8,9, 10
Hygroscopicity refers to the ability of an aerosol particle to uptake water vapor from air
and determines the resulting aerosol particle size as a function of the relative humidity (RH).11, 12
Many hygroscopic compounds, such as sodium chloride (NaCl) or ammonium sulfate, have a
characteristic RH at which they convert from a solid to a liquid drop, termed the deliquescence
point. Aerosol particle deliquescence point is typically determined by measuring the ensemble
averaged mass growth factor (wet mass/dry mass) as a function of RH.13 This measurement shows
no water uptake below the deliquescence RH and then a discrete jump in mass growth factor upon
deliquescence.14-16 These prior works suggest that deliquescence occurs instantaneously at a given
RH and have informed the prevailing assumption of instantaneous aerosol particle dissolution at
the deliquescence RH in current aerosol models.17 However, some recent works have shown that

water condenses on NaCl particles prior to the macroscopic deliquescence point and have
measured finite dissolution rates prior to deliquescence.18-21 Aerosol salts are generally nonspherical in shape, which is expected to influence the dynamics of water adsorption and particle
dissolution in a way that cannot be captured by bulk analysis techniques. The dissolution
mechanisms of hygroscopic aerosol particles and the related water condensation dynamics remain
obscure due to the lack of single particle measurements.
High spatial and mass resolution single particle measurements, such as in situ atomic force
microscopy (AFM), electrodynamic balance, optical microscopy/light scattering, and
environmental electron microscopy can reveal selected dynamics of water-aerosol interactions.
AFM has visualized droplet formation on hygroscopic nanoparticles, but only reveals droplet
surface topography with no information about the droplet interior, such as the aerosol particle
dissolution dynamics.22,

23

Optical microscopy can observe particle dissolution and

recrystallization, but has a spatial resolution limit of ~500 nm.14, 24, 25 Electrodynamic balance
measures mass growth factor of individual aerosol particles as a function of RH, but provides little
information about the aerosol particle morphology or dissolution dynamics during
deliquescence.26-28 Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) and environmental
scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) can image individual hygroscopic nanoparticles with
nanometer scale spatial resolution during deliquescence.29-31 In ETEM the use of differential
pumping apertures around the sample region enables keeping the sample, typically a standard
carbon coated TEM grid, at a higher pressure (~10 mbar) than the high vacuum in the microscope.
Cooling the sample is required to raise the RH to the deliquescence point of hygroscopic salts.
Prior ETEM experiments have observed water uptake and shape changes of nanosized aerosol
particles prior to the deliquescence point. However, these techniques are limited to low water

partial pressures of ~10 mbar, which is not representative of pressures in the troposphere. Further,
prior scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging
did not provide significant contrast to distinguish between the droplet and aerosol particle, which
prevented visualizing and quantifying aerosol particle dissolution dynamics during deliquescence.
In this study, we employ a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based in situ TEM
sample cell to visualize water condensation and dissolution dynamics of cuboid NaCl
nanoparticles with single nanometer spatial resolution prior to and during deliquescence.32-34
Atmospheric aerosols are generally a mix of inorganic and organic compounds and NaCl is
representative of highly hygroscopic aerosol particle well-known to readily deliquesce under
relevant atmospheric humidity conditions. Real time movies of water condensation and aerosol
particle dissolution with increasing RH unveiled complex dynamics prior to deliquescence. The
use of scanning TEM (STEM) imaging provided high contrast between the NaCl particle and
surrounding water droplet that permitted detailed quantitative analysis of droplet growth and
aerosol particle dissolution dynamics. Aerosol particle dissolution and water condensation
occurred in three qualitatively distinct stages with increasing RH, including adsorption of a ~100
nm water layer, temporal fluctuations in particle shape, and intermittent dissolution dynamics not
previously observed by other single particle methods. This work unveils complex dynamics
leading up to deliquescence and challenges the common conception that deliquescence of
nanosized aerosol particles is a single-stage instantaneous phase transition. We expect that the in
situ TEM methodology established here will become a powerful approach to investigate more
complex multicomponent, multiphase aerosols and their interaction with water.

Materials and Methods
MEMS sample preparation
The in situ TEM cell was composed of two microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
chips, each composed of a silicon base with a 550 x 50 µm hole in the center covered by a
freestanding 50 nm thick amorphous silicon nitride film. One chip was patterned with four 500 nm
gold spacer posts at the corners to set the chamber height. Each chip was cleaned with acetone and
methanol to remove a protective photoresist coating and dried gently with filtered compressed air.
The chips were plasma cleaned (Harrick Plasma, PDC-32G) with an air plasma for 45 seconds to
remove residual carbon contamination from the solvent. After a wait period of several hours to
allow the chips to lose their temporary hydrophilicity, the aerosol particle sample was deposited
on the chip that is illuminated by the TEM electron beam first (see in NaCl Sample Preparation).
Sample chips with NaCl particles were stored in sealed containers with silica gel desiccant until
use.

NaCl Sample Preparation
Aerosol particles were deposited on MEMS chips using the setup shown in Figure S1a.
Briefly, a 0.01 g/mL aqueous NaCl (ACS, 99.0% min, Thermo Scientific Chemicals) solution was
atomized and the liquid droplet stream was passed through a silica gel diffusion drier to form dry
NaCl particles using a sheath flow of filtered room air. The resulting dry NaCl nanoparticles were
charged with Krypton 85 and then impacted on an electrically grounded MEMS sample chip
supported on a steel mesh. The particle concentration was monitored downstream using an
Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter (TSI 3756 with a detection lower limit of 2.5 nm) and

was found to always be > 105 cm-3. The deposition time was 4 hours and sample flow rate was 0.3
L/min. The sample chips were stored in a closed container with silica desiccant prior to use.

In situ TEM
We used a commercially available MEMS based in situ TEM holder with minor
modifications for all experiments (Poseidon Plus sample holder, Protochips, USA). The
microfluidic lines (PEEK HPLC tubes) in the sample holder were first flushed with 200 proof
ethanol, filtered compressed air, and finally dried in a vacuum pump (Pfeiffer Vacuum, USA)
overnight to remove residual water and ethanol. The sample holder was then plasma cleaned with
an air plasma for 15 minutes to remove residual carbon. A microfluidic gas chamber was formed
by sandwiching together two silicon MEMS chips and aligning the imaging windows. The bottom
chip was surrounded by a gasket and the top a metal plate, which together hermetically sealed the
sample region at near atmospheric pressure (Figure 1a). A leak test was performed in a vacuum
pump overnight to guarantee that the sample was hermetically sealed, with the sample reaching a
minimum pressure of at least 8.6×10-5 hPa within 15 minutes. The microfluidic cell initially
contained room air with an RH of ~30-40%. The RH in the sample chamber was increased by
flowing filtered room air through a water-filled Nafion® humidification tube (Perma Pure, MH™Series Humidifiers) into the sample region at a rate of 0.5 mL/s (Figure S1b). The high RH vapor
was delivered to the sample chamber via fluid tubes connecting the sample chamber to the back of
the sample holder. The RH was measured continuously using an RH meter (Vaisala HMT330 with
an error of ± 2%) at the outlet of the TEM sample holder. However, deliquescence of NaCl
occurred at an RH of ~64% as measured at the sample holder outlet, suggesting that this RH
measurement was incorrect due to water vapor adsorption in the sample holder. We performed a
set of control experiments that showed the RH measured at the gas flow inlet to the sample holder

was consistent with the expected deliquescence RH. We determined a correction factor for the
outlet RH measurement, 1.16 ± 0.01 , which was used to correct all RH data (Figure S2 in
Supporting Information). The control experiments for correcting RH for water vapor losses in the
microfluidic tubing are described in the Supporting Information. All RH data displayed in this
article are expected to have an error of at least ± 2%, which is the instrument error. However, there
are other potential sources of error that are difficult to quantify, which are discussed below in the
results.
All imaging experiments were performed with a JEOL JEM-2100F operating at 200 kV
and 40 pA beam current. Images and in situ movies were captured in bright field (BF) scanning
TEM (STEM) imaging mode with a camera length of 10 cm. STEM imaging was utilized because
it produces high contrast, high resolution images at low electron fluxes even for relatively thick
sample substrates and water layers.35, 36 The electron flux was calculated by dividing the beam
current (in e-/s) by the STEM image area to yield a value in e-/Å2 s. Control experiments with NaCl
nanoparticles in ~40% RH vapor were performed to establish the optimal imaging magnification
range that did not cause electron beam damage to the NaCl (See Supporting Movie 1 for full in
situ movie).37 We found that a magnification of < 100 kX and a dwell time of 5 𝜇𝑠 did not cause
observable damage to NaCl particles with sizes of ~500 – 1000 nm, which corresponds to electron
fluxes of < 0.374 e-/Å2 s. In situ STEM videos were recorded at a framerate of 10 fps by Camtasia
Studios screen capture software and processed in ImageJ and VideoMach. Custom scripts written
in MATLAB were used to track the droplet and particle projected area as a function of time and
RH in the in situ TEM movies. The droplet and particle edge detection had an error of ± 1 pixel
based on visual inspection and comparison of the segmented image and the original image. The
script measuring the NaCl surface curvature was adapted from Driscoll et al.38

Results and Discussion
The RH in the sample cell was increased from ambient levels to the deliquescence point of
NaCl by flowing humidified air into the sample chamber (Figure 1a, Figure S1). This procedure
of introducing humid air slowly increased RH over several hundred seconds, which contrasts with
aerosol instruments that measure steady state aerosol size/mass as a function of RH to track
hygroscopic growth. The slow RH increase rate coupled with continuous movie mode imaging
allowed observing intermediate states of aerosol particle hydration prior to deliquescence. We
repeated the experiment on around 20 different particles over separate three experiments and
observed similar phenomena each time.
Aside from the instrument error of ±2%, temperature fluctuations and the imaging electron
beam were the main potential sources of error in the RH measurement. The room temperature was
used for RH measurement, which could vary slightly from the sample temperature. However, the
TEM instrument room has strict temperature control and the sample was allowed to thermally
equilibrate for ~10 minutes after placing in the microscope so this is unlikely to lead to significant
error. The previous study by Wang et al. showed that the electron beam was able to prompt water
vapor condensation by decreasing the local water vapor pressure (increasing the local RH).39 In
this prior study the authors showed that a broad, stationary TEM beam with an electron flux of
0.226 e-/Å2 s induced water condensation from saturated water vapor (RH = 100%). Here we used
STEM mode with a smaller electron flux of < 0.1 e-/Å2s and subsaturated vapor. Taken together,
this suggests the electron beam will not promote water condensation. As shown below, several
measurements showed that NaCl deliquesces under the electron beam near the accepted value of
75%, suggesting temperature difference and the electron beam did not significantly modify the RH.

Electron beam damage of particles during TEM imaging can be due to knock-on or
sputtering damage. For instance, Ott et al. showed electron beam damage of ammonium sulfate
particles caused formation of circular holes.37 Supporting Movie 2 shows electron beam damage
of an NaCl particle at ~40% RH due to sputtering/knock-on at a magnification of 400 kX (electron
flux of 4.15 e-/Å2 s). Electron beam damage to the NaCl particles was not observed for low
magnifications (< 100 kX) and electron fluxes (< 0.374 e-/Å2 s) used to collect the data in this
study (Supporting Movie 1). As long as magnification was limited to < 100 kX, we did not observe
any qualitative differences in the dynamics of the NaCl dissolution and droplet growth.
Hygroscopic growth measurements on aerosolized particles are ideally performed in the
aerosol phase; however, a sample substrate was required to image the nanoscale dynamics of
particle dissolution and droplet growth. Prior work has shown that the surface could have an impact
on the hygroscopic growth.31 Chatre et al. showed that anisotropic droplets can grow on
ammonium sulfate on a hydrophilic surface during imaging with environmental SEM.31 However,
there was no indication in this study that a hydrophilic surface significantly impacted the
deliquescence RH. Indeed, several prior studies measured the deliquescence point of salt particles
on hydrophobic surfaces and achieved reasonable values.16, 18, 22 The contact angle of a saturated
NaCl solution on the silicon nitride was measured to be 86 ± 0.17° (Figure S3). Control
experiments indicated that the SiN surface alone did not condense water. Supporting movie 3
shows that droplets only grew on the salt particles when the RH was approaching the deliquescence
point and no droplets formed on the bare SiN. Our experimental deliquescence point was always
near 75%, which was close to the literature value. The previous studies and our data strongly
suggest the SiN surface did not significantly impact the water uptake dynamics or deliquescence
point.

and RH = 74.5%. Images were acquired at a magnification of 60 kX and electron flux of 0.090 e/Å2 s. The particle size at t = 0 s was 1010 nm × 960 nm. The error of each length measurement
was ± 10 nm and the error of the area measurement was 0.0139 µm2.
Initially, images showed dry NaCl nanoparticles with irregular cuboid shape in contact with
45% RH room air (Figure 1b, See Supporting Movie 4 for full in situ movie). Increasing RH to
66% caused the sharp corners of the NaCl cubes to dissolve and formed nearly isotropic cubes
with truncated corners. A ~100 nm water layer was observed around the NaCl droplet as a lighter
‘halo’ around the dark contrast particle. As we increased RH to near the deliquescence RH the

water layer grew into a circular droplet (303.1 s) and the NaCl particle dissolved (307.8 s). The
slow increase in RH over time and high contrast between the NaCl and water droplet enabled
tracking their projected areas with time and RH (Figure 1c). Deliquescence occurred at a measured
RH of about 74%, marked by complete dissolution of the NaCl particle and a rapid increase in the
growth rate of the water droplet. We compared the growth factor of an NaCl particle as a function
of RH to prior measurements by Gupta et al. (Figure 2, Supporting Movie 3).16 The volume of the
particle and droplet cannot be determined from the TEM images, which provide 2D projections of
the objects. Instead we utilized the “2D Area Ratio” as implemented by Gupta et al., which is the
ratio of the droplet projected area to the initial dry NaCl projected area as determined from optical
microscopy images.16 Interestingly, recasting the 2D area ratio as a function of the RH revealed
hygroscopic growth of the NaCl prior to the deliquescence point starting at about RH = 65%,
whereas the literature measurements showed essentially no growth until the deliquescence point.
The 2D area ratio increased monotonically up to an RH of 74.5%, at which point the NaCl
dissolved completely and the liquid droplet grew larger than the image area and could not be
measured any longer. We take this point as the deliquescence RH.

particle size at t = 0 s was 880 nm × 680 nm. The error of each length measurement was ± 10 nm
and the error of the area measurement was 0.011 µm2.
Careful inspection of the in situ TEM movies revealed water condensation and particle
dissolution occurred prior to deliquescence via a multistaged dynamic process (Figure 3, See
Supporting Movie 4 for full in situ movie). We observed three RH ranges that produced
qualitatively different aerosol particle dissolution and water condensation dynamics. The RH
ranges of the three stages were defined based on the water layer thickness and dynamics and the
NaCl particle shape and dissolution dynamics. We note that the RH range for each condensation
stage could vary from particle to particle depending on factors such as initial particle size/shape
and RH inaccuracies. Figure 3a shows time lapsed images of an NaCl nanoparticle as a function
of RH and time. The first stage of water adsorption spanned an RH range of about 46 – 53% and
was characterized by minimal change in the projected area of the NaCl particle (Figure 3b),
adsorption of a sub-100 nm water (Figures 3c), and dissolution and rounding of the corners of the
NaCl cube. The intensity line profiles of the droplet and NaCl particle in Figure 3c represent the
pixel intensities of the line drawn in the 159 s image in Figure 3a. The pixel intensities are
inversely proportional to the local density, material thickness, and atomic number of the material
in each pixel; the water layer has lower density and thickness (in the beam direction) than the NaCl
so it had larger pixel intensity values. The intensity profiles provide information about the shape
of the water layer and the NaCl cube in the 3rd dimension. Based on the intensity profiles the water

did not form a sessile droplet initially but instead assumed a negative curvature, wetting both the
silicon nitride and the NaCl particle (Figure 3d). This was likely because water was found to
partially wet the silicon nitride with a contact angle of 86°. It is possible the negative curvature of
the region where the NaCl met the silicon nitride encouraged water condensation; however, we
could not measure the 3D shape of the NaCl cube or water layer so it is not possible to estimate
the local negative curvature. The intensity of the center NaCl remained the approximately same,
which suggested that either water did not adhere to the top of the cube or the water layer was very
thin. After deliquescence the droplet assumed a sessile droplet shape (t = 268 s). Rounding of sharp
corners is consistent with prior ETEM observations and is due to the increased solubility of high
curvature corners as described by the Gibbs-Thomson effect.24,25,40, 41 The second stage of water
condensation prior to deliquescence occurred over an RH range of about 54 – 68%. Here the water
layer thickness, observed as an orange halo around the NaCl in the false colored images, increased
to between 100 – 200 nm and the curvature of the NaCl cube corners fluctuated in time. The third
stage of water condensation occurred at RH > 68% and was distinguished by a monotonic increase
in the droplet area and decrease in the NaCl projected area until the aerosol particle completely
dissolved. Interestingly, dissolution occurred in discrete steps instead of continuous isotropic
dissolution.

The second stage of water condensation was investigated in more detail by measuring the
NaCl surface curvature as a function of time and RH (Figure 4, See Supporting Movie 4 for full
in situ movie). Here the surface curvature (r) is defined as the reciprocal of the radius of the incircle
for a given set of points along the surface of the NaCl particle. When determining and comparing
cube corner curvature, we note that the terminology, “high” or “low,” for corner curvature is
relative to the curvature of that corner at a different time or relative to a neighboring corner of the
same cube. Figure 4a shows time lapsed in situ BF STEM images of an NaCl cube with the water
layer removed by digital background subtraction to isolate the NaCl particle for analysis. Here we
observed the top right cube corner curvature fluctuated every few seconds between a low and high
curvature state via dissolution and crystallization. There was nearly no change to the particle area
during this dynamic process. The curvature change dynamics can be observed very clearly in the
in situ STEM movies (Supporting Movies 4-6). We note that all corners of a given cube
experienced curvature fluctuations with one or two corners typically showing the largest
fluctuations. The corner with the largest curvature fluctuations was different for different particles
(Supporting Movies 4-6). Mapping the surface curvature of adjacent cube corners showed that the
curvature fluctuations were anticorrelated in time (Figures 4b-e). For instance, the righthand cube
corner in Figure 4d showed an increase in curvature that was synchronized in time with a decrease
in the left-hand corner curvature (Figure 4d,e). The synchronized increase/decrease in adjacent
corner curvature was further evidenced by the negative Pearson’s correlation coefficient over these
time ranges (inset Figure 4c,e). The curvature of non-adjacent corners showed nearly no time
correlation (Figure S4).

The corner curvature time fluctuations can be explained in terms of curvature-dependent
solubility and NaCl concentration fluctuations in the droplet (Figure 4f). According to the GibbsThomson effect, the solubility of a solid increases with increasing (positive) surface curvature:41
4𝜎𝑉 𝑟

𝑐𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙 = 𝑐∞ exp [ 𝑅𝑇𝑚 ],

(1)

where 𝑐𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙 is the curvature dependent solubility, 𝑐∞ is the bulk solubility, 𝜎 is the surface energy
of the NaCl, 𝑉𝑚 is the molar volume of solid NaCl. Interestingly, there was minimal change to the
projected area of the NaCl particle or water droplet while the RH increased by ~10%. This suggests
that the water droplet was saturated with NaCl over this range, halting dissolution. We propose
that fluctuations in the NaCl nanoparticle shape were due to small scale fluctuations in local water
partial pressure or vapor pressure at the droplet surface, which caused water exchange between the
droplet and vapor phase. These fluctuations could be due to small local fluctuations in gas flow
rate, temperature, or droplet curvature. Prior work by Wang et al. revealed that the local
temperature near a condensing water droplet imaged with LP-TEM could fluctuation ± 10 °C due
to electron beam heating and the latent heat of condensation. 39 Likewise, contact line pinning to
surface defects or patchy surface chemistry on the silicon nitride could locally change the water
curvature, leading to changes in local water vapor pressure.42 Exchange of water between the vapor
and liquid phase in turn decreased or increased the local droplet solute concentration, promoting

crystallization or dissolution depending on local surface curvature. We propose two potential
mechanisms—dissolution-crystallization and surface diffusion—by which the NaCl cube could
reconfigure its shape in response to local droplet NaCl concentration changes. The dissolutionrecrystallization mechanism relies on the slightly asymmetric initial shape of the NaCl (dynamic
shape factor of 1.0843), which causes the corner curvatures to decrease by unequal amounts during
the initial corner rounding in stage one of water adsorption (Figure 4f.i). The curvature
fluctuations of two adjacent corners with unequal curvature occurs via exchange of NaCl ions with
the droplet in response to fluctuations in the droplet solute concentration. For instance, if the
droplet NaCl concentration, 𝑐𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙 , is less than the solubility (s1) of corner 1 (Figure 4f.ii) and
larger than the solubility of corner 2 (s2), this will cause synchronized NaCl dissolution at corner
1 and crystallization at corner 2. In other words, the droplet is subsaturated near corner 1 and
supersaturated near corner 2.
A second potential pathway for the corner curvature fluctuations is surface diffusion of
NaCl from regions of high curvature to low curvature (Figure 4f.iii). High curvature cube corners
have intrinsically higher chemical potential compared to regions of lower curvature.44 Instead of
dissolving into solution, NaCl ion pairs at high curvature regions could respond to local decreases
in droplet solute concentration by moving to regions of lower curvature and chemical potential via
surface diffusion. Deposition of NaCl on the cube faces separating adjacent corners was not
observed because the <100> facets are stable and defect free, which introduces a substantial
nucleation energy barrier.45 Instead, NaCl ion pairs moved along the <100> facets, potentially as
rapidly diffusing “floating islands,”45 and deposited on cube corners that contain defects and low
coordination number surface sites with low nucleation energy barriers. This proposed mechanism
is consistent with the experimentally observed anti-correlation between the curvature of adjacent

corners and the uncorrelated curvature changes of non-adjacent cube corners (Figure S4).
However, due to the limited spatial resolution of the low dose in situ STEM imaging required to
prevent electron beam damage, it is not possible at this time to distinguish whether the dissolutionrecrystallization or surface diffusion mechanism control the curvature fluctuation dynamics.
Figure 5 displays the dissolution dynamics of an NaCl particle with an initial dry edge
length of ~1 𝜇𝑚. Once the RH was within a few percent of the deliquescence point, the droplet
grew rapidly in time and the NaCl cube dissolved concurrently (Figure 5a, see Supporting Movie
4 for full in situ movie). Interestingly, the NaCl particle intermittently dissolved in discrete steps
with each dissolution step occurring along a single <100> plane, as opposed to dissolving
continuously and isotropically along all crystal directions. This is exemplified in the images at the
296 s and 302 s time points and shown by the time dependent NaCl projected area (Figure 5b) and
time dependent droplet growth and particle dissolution rates (Figure 5c). The dissolution rate plot
in Figure 5c shows that discrete dissolution steps were interspersed by lag times of several seconds
where the particle area remained constant. The liquid droplet surrounding the NaCl displayed
discrete growth steps that mirrored the particle dissolution steps in time. Correlation analysis of
the droplet growth and NaCl dissolution rates showed strong anti-correlation with a Pearson’s
correlation coefficient of R = -0.84. The terrace-ledge-framework for crystal dissolution predicts
that dissolution begins from a defect site at the corner of the NaCl, which then propagates across
the crystal face to remove the entire crystal plane.46 Our observations show that this mechanism
can rapidly remove several lattice planes in a few seconds.

5d).19 The mass normalized dissolution rate ranged from 10-3 – 10-1 s-1 and increased as a function
of time and RH, in agreement with the prior measurements by Ma et al. for micron sized NaCl
aerosol particles. However, in contrast to the prior work, the in situ observations here showed that
the instantaneous dissolution rate did not increase monotonically with increasing RH due to the
intermittent dissolution process. Instead, this analysis revealed that the average dissolution rate
increased with RH due to more frequent and larger dissolution steps. As the RH increased the water
condensation rate onto the surface of the droplet increased, decreasing the droplet solute
concentration and thus increasing the thermodynamic driving force for crystal defect generation
and crystal plane dissolution. Taking the ensemble average over many particles undergoing this
discrete dissolution process would indeed be expected to produce an apparent monotonic increase
in dissolution rate as observed by Ma et al.
The lag times between discrete dissolution steps partially stemmed from saturation of the
water with NaCl, which temporarily halted dissolution. Further RH increases caused additional
water condensation and a decrease in the droplet NaCl concentration, which spurred additional
dissolution steps. These dynamics contrast dissolution processes in bulk liquid where the solute
concentration is nearly constant with time and the particle dissolves continuously.47-49 Here a

negative feedback loop was established where NaCl dissolution rapidly saturated the liquid droplet
and temporarily halted dissolution.
In contrast to conventional understanding of deliquescence, these experiments demonstrate
non-instantaneous water uptake on NaCl, where water condenses first as a film on the NaCl surface,
followed by formation of liquid droplet that co-exists with a solid NaCl particle.43 Conventional
understanding has considered water absorption as a significant water uptake mechanism only for
sparingly soluble and insoluble aerosol particles.50 Soluble hygroscopic particles are generally
considered to uptake water primarily due to solubility-driven hygroscopic growth, i.e., Raoult’s
law induced decrease in water vapor pressure.17 This work demonstrates that both water absorption
and hygroscopic growth significantly contribute to water uptake on hygroscopic NaCl particles.
The Hybrid Activity Model (HAM) for water uptake was developed to consider water uptake by
both adsorption and hygroscopic growth.51 While this model and prior light scattering experiments
have suggested water uptake follows this mechanism, the model and measurements could not
capture the dynamics of water uptake or particle shape change and dissolution. Our work clearly
demonstrates with single particle measurements that water absorption is an important water uptake
mechanism for hygroscopic particles. It further demonstrates that empirical single particle
measurements are required to understand water uptake and particle dissolution dynamics prior to
and at the deliquescence RH.
This work demonstrated direct nanoscale visualization of water vapor condensation on
individual NaCl nanoparticles and the subsequent particle dissolution dynamics using a closed in
situ TEM sample cell with RH control. This in situ TEM approach to observing hygroscopic
growth of aerosol particles is distinguished from prior measurements by the slow increase in RH
with time and continuous movie mode imaging of single nanoparticles, this enabled observing

intermediate states of water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution dynamics prior to
deliquescence. Water was observed to interact with NaCl in three qualitatively different stages as
the RH was increased from room levels (~40%) to the deliquescence point of ~75%. Initially, a <
100 nm water layer adsorbed on the NaCl and caused preferential dissolution of the sharp cube
corners. With increasing RH, a few hundred nanometer water layer deposited on the NaCl and the
curvature of adjacent cube corners was observed to fluctuate in time. We proposed
dissolution/recrystallization and surface diffusion mechanisms that are consistent with the
experimentally observed fluctuation dynamics. Finally, we observed intermittent dissolution of the
NaCl particle and co-existence of a solid particle and liquid droplet at RH levels very near the
deliquescence point (> 70%). Intermittent dissolution was likely due to saturation of the liquid
droplet with NaCl and the slow rate of defect site generation on the NaCl surface. NaCl aerosol is
relevant to the atmosphere and well-known for its propensity to swell and form droplets at both
sub and supersaturated RH conditions. This work enhances our understanding of deliquescence of
hygroscopic aerosol particles using direct nanoscale visualization to unveil complex dissolution
phenomena occurring prior to deliquescence, even for highly hygroscopic particles such as NaCl.
This concept of water adsorption prior to deliquescence and subsequent multi-step dissolution has
been previously postulated, it was mainly attributed to partially water soluble substances.52, 53
Although particle surface is needed for water condensation, the prevailing theory considers aerosol
particle volume and bulk solubility at deliquescence as the sole driver of droplet growth. Recent
work here and elsewhere questions these widely used aerosol particle deliquescence theories.
Importantly, this work challenges the idea of prompt deliquescence for highly soluble and
hygroscopic aerosol particles with visual evidence and emphasizes the need for single particle,
nanoscale characterization of dynamic aerosol phase processes.
