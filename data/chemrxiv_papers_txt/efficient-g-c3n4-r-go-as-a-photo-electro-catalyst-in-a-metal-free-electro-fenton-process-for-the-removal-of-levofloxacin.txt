Emerging pollutants significantly impact various ecosystems due to their complex composition,
poor biodegradability, and high toxicity. There are several methods for removing these pollutions like
advanced oxidation processes, Photo catalyst, and electro chemical processes. The electro-Fenton
process combines the advantages of electrochemical and advanced oxidation processes. However,
issues such as residual iron remain problematic.
In this project, a composite catalyst of g-C3 N4 and rGO, which is completely organic, metal-free,
efficient, economical, and green, was utilized as a catalyst in a photo-electro-Fenton-like process
to remove the antibiotic levofloxacin. The optimal conditions of this process, including current
densitye, pH, aeration rat, concentration, and composition of the catalyst, were investigated and the
optimum amounts of them are 50 mA/cm2 , 4 ,400 ml/min ,120 mg/l and g-C3 N4 /rGO-1 composite
respectively. The performance of the synthesized catalyst was compared with that of pure g-C3 N4
in the process. The electro-Fenton process without light exposure and the photocatalyst process
were also compared with this process under optimal conditions.
The results demonstrated that the synergistic effect of these processes enhanced levofloxacin
removal, achieving a removal percentage of 87% within 90 minutes. The stability of the catalyst
was evaluated over four consecutive cycles, showing only a 15% decrease in removal efficiency
during the fourth cycle. Additionally, the kinetics of reactions at different conditions were studied,
and the reaction rate constants were calculated at a constant temperature.

Introduction

Water pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental challenges worldwide. In recent years, the
growing diversity and complexity of pollutant compounds
have made the release of emerging contaminants a critical concern. Additionally, the intricate nature of various wastewater types has led researchers to characterize
their properties using rheological methods. These emerging pollutants, which include unregulated chemical, microbial, and radiological substances, pose a severe threat
to ecosystems due to their complex composition, persistence, and high toxicity. Among them, antibiotics are
particularly alarming, as they interfere with essential biological processes. The widespread use of antibiotics in
modern society has significantly increased their presence
in wastewater, establishing them as major emerging pollutants [1–7].
Among the various categories of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones stand out as particularly hazardous in aquatic

environments [8]. These compounds find wide applications in treating infectious diseases of the respiratory
tract, genitourinary tract, and skin structures [9]. Levofloxacin (LEV), a third-generation fluoroquinolone, exhibits a broad spectrum of antibacterial effects [10]. Consequently, residual amounts of levofloxacin accumulate in
the food chain, posing a global threat to both aquatic
and terrestrial ecosystems [11]. The release of such pollutants into the environment, infiltrating different water
sources, necessitates enhanced water purification methods for various uses. Removing these substances during
water treatment presents more challenges and complexities than treating wastewater containing these pollutants,
highlighting the urgent need for innovative wastewater
treatment technologies [12].
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) offer a promising solution by converting recalcitrant organic pollutants
into harmless products such as carbon dioxide and water [13]. Fenton’s reagent, a combination of hydrogen
peroxide (H2 O2 ) and ferrous ion, is one of the most com-

mon methods of advanced oxidation for removing organic
pollutants from water. This method boasts non-toxic
reactants and products, with hydrogen peroxide decomposing into water and oxygen, making it environmentally
friendly [3].
Despite its advantages, the conventional Fenton process has still some challenges such as the requirement for
high iron concentrations and the generation of sludge,
leading to secondary pollution. The electro-Fenton process, where hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion are generated electrochemically, addresses some of these issues [14]. However, the problem of metal leaching and
the need for secondary purification persist. A promising alternative is the electro-Fenton-like process utilizing metal-free catalysts, which not only outperforms the
Fenton-based process at higher pH levels but also eliminates the need for metal reclamation [15].
Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ), a photocatalytic
nanoparticle composed of organic carbon and nitrogen,
presents a notable solution. Its easy and accessible
synthesis without metals makes it a prominent candidate for various applications. To harness more visible light, strategies like doping, defect engineering, and
compositing with other materials can enhance the band
gap and properties of g-C3 N4 [16–18]. Studies indicate that graphene-based nanoparticles, with their twodimensional network and sp2 conjugation structure, can
increase hydrogen peroxide production in the oxygen reduction reaction, a crucial aspect of the electro-Fenton
process. Moreover, the extensive conjugated carbon
structure in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) provides high
electrical conductivity, making this composite suitable
for diverse applications, including organic contaminant
removal [19, 20].
Despite extensive research on advanced oxidation processes, particularly electro-Fenton, the creation of secondary pollution has hindered their widespread adoption.
In this article, we explore a novel approach: the photoelectro-Fenton-like process, utilizing a fully organic catalyst consisting of graphite carbon nitride and reduced
graphene oxide. This innovative method is employed to
tackle emerging pollutants, particularly focusing on levofloxacin, a resistant antibiotic contaminant.
This study investigates the synthesis and characterization of g-C3 N4 /rGO composites and evaluates their performance as photo-electrocatalysts in the photo-electroFenton-like process for the efficient removal of levofloxacin. The optimal operational conditions and the
stability of the catalyst are also examined to provide an
understanding of its potential for practical applications.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Materials

Graphite flat was purchased from Redoxkala company, and Levofloxacin (> 99.0 wt %) was purchased
from Tehrandarou company. Sodium sulfate (Na2 SO4 ),
Sodium thiosulfate (Na2 S2 O3 ), sulfuric acid (H2 SO4 ),
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and urea were obtained from
Merk company. Graphene oxide was obtained from Persian Shimi company. Throughout the experiment, ultrapure water was used.
2.2.

Preparation of Catalysts

g -C3 N4 Preparation: Graphitic carbon nitride, a
metal-free catalyst, was synthesized from a urea precursor as follows:
15 mg of urea was added to a crucible, and it was completely wrapped with thick aluminum foil. The crucible
was then placed in a furnace and heated to 550 ◦ C at a
heating rate of 5 ◦ C/min. The synthesis was carried out
at this temperature for 3 hours. Finally, after cooling to
ambient temperature, carbon nitride was obtained with
a conversion rate of 3%.
g -C3 N4 /rGO Preparation: g-C3 N4 /rGO was prepared via a green calcination method [21] using a mixture
of urea and graphene oxide. To synthesize this composite
with different compositions, the precursors were dissolved
in 200 mL of deionized water and sonicated 30 minutes to
improve solubility. Next, the solution was stirred thoroughly for 3 hours at 700 rpm and 65 ◦ C, ensuring a
homogeneous combination of precursors.
In the next step, the solution was placed in an oven
at 70 ◦ C overnight to dry completely. After drying, the
precursor was finely ground using a mortar. Finally, composite catalysts with 0.1, 1, and 10 compositions of rGO
were synthesized based on the conversion rate of urea. In
this article, the name rGO/g-C3 N4 -x is used to specify
the composite catalyst (x = 0.1, 1, 10) (Figure 1).

Characterization Methods

The morphology of the electro-photo catalysts was
characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron
Microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The crystal phase of the catalysts was
analyzed using X-ray crystallography (XRD-PW 1730
λ = 1.54059 Å: Cu LFF). Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to confirm correct synthesis by identifying the bonding vibrations of the catalysts.
Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) was conducted
to calculate the band gap of the nanoparticles. In order to
determine the type of photocatalyst and the conduction

0.22 µm film every 10 minutes. 50 µl of 0.1 M sodium

band levels, Mott-Schottky analysis was performed using a Galaxy carbon working electrode, graphite counter
electrode, and AgCl/Ag reference electrode. The photoluminescence technique (PL) was conducted to analyze
the photoluminescence properties of the catalysts. Additionally, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was
conducted to determine the specific surface area of the
synthesized nanoparticles.

Photo Electro-Fenton-like Performance
Evaluation

The activity of the Photo Electro-Fenton-like (PEFL)
system was evaluated by the degradation of levofloxacin. Degradation experiments were conducted in
a single-compartment cell with a two-electrode system
consisting of graphite anode and cathode electrodes
(2 cm × 3 cm × 5 mm) placed 2 cm apart. Air was bubbled directly into the reaction solution through a pipe
positioned near the cathode. Levofloxacin at a concentration of 25 ppm in 250 mL of 0.05 M Na2 SO4 electrolyte was degraded under various conditions of aeration, current density, initial pH, catalyst concentration,
and catalyst composition over 90 minutes at room temperature. The initial pH was adjusted using 0.1 M NaOH
and 0.05 M H2 SO4 .
2.5.

Analytical Methods

The concentration of levofloxacin was measured using
an ultraviolet spectrometer (Shimadzu/UVmini-1240) at
its characteristic peak of 298 nm throughout the experiment. The calibration curve is shown in figure S1. Before
the electrocatalytic degradation, the solution containing
levofloxacin and catalyst was stirred for 20 minutes in a
dark box to investigate the adsorption of g-C3 N4 /rGO.
Samples of 1 mL were withdrawn and filtered through a

Characterization

The FESEM and TEM images of the nanoparticles
are illustrated in Figure 2. As shown in these images,
the layers in reduced graphene oxide (Figure 2b) are
more separated from each other compared to the layers
in graphene oxide (Figure 2a). This increased separation between the layers enhances the accessibility of the
active sites of the catalyst and improves mass transfer.
The sheet-like structure of graphitic carbon nitride (gC3 N4 ) is clearly visible in Figure 2c. These sheets are
well-defined and exhibit a distinct morphology. When
combined with reduced graphene oxide, as seen in the
g-C3 N4 /rGO-1 composite, the g-C3 N4 sheets are placed
on the rGO layers, creating a synergistic structure (Figure 2d-f). This arrangement in the composite material is
advantageous as it maximizes the contact area between
g-C3 N4 and rGO, facilitating efficient charge transfer.
The improved separation of rGO layers and the strategic placement of g-C3 N4 sheets contribute significantly to
the enhanced photo-electrocatalytic performance of the
composite. This structure is particularly beneficial in the
electro-Fenton process for pollutant removal, as it promotes better interaction with the pollutants and efficient
degradation. To analyze the crystallographic structure
of pure g-C3 N4 , rGO, and the g-C3 N4 /rGO composite,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed, and the
results are presented in Figure 3.
According to the literature, graphitic carbon nitride
(g-C3 N4 ) exhibits two main peaks at around 13° and 27°,
corresponding to the tri-s-triazine units and its layered
structure, respectively. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
shows a peak at around 27° and another at approximately
42°, which are associated with its loosely stacked sheets
and turbostratic band orientation, respectively [22, 23].
The XRD patterns of the samples align well with those
reported in the references.
The presence of the peak at around 42° in the rGO
pattern indicates the absence of graphite formation, confirming the successful reduction of graphene oxide. The
g-C3 N4 /rGO composite exhibits similar XRD peaks as
its individual components. However, the intensity of
the peaks in the composite is reduced compared to pure
g-C3 N4 . This reduction in peak intensity suggests increased defect formation in the composite catalyst due
to the addition of rGO, which disrupts the crystalline
order of g-C3 N4 .

The incorporation of rGO into the g-C3 N4 matrix re-

sults in a more disordered structure, which can enhance
the composite’s catalytic properties by providing more
active sites and improving the overall efficiency of the
photo-electrocatalytic process in the electro-Fenton system.
FTIR analysis was employed to investigate the
bonds and functional groups present in the synthesized
nanoparticles, with the results displayed in Figure 4. A
peak in the 3000–3625 cm-1 range corresponds to the OH
functional group, which is significantly weakened in rGO
due to the reduction process. Additional characteristic
peaks include the C=O bond around 1730 cm-1 , which indicates the presence of carbonyl groups, and a peak at approximately 1600 cm-1 , confirming the graphitic domain
and sp2 hybridized carbon structure [24]. g-C3 N4 exhibits distinct peaks indicative of its chemical structure.
Peaks around 3080 and 3200 cm-1 correspond to N-H
bonds, representing residual amino groups and absorbed
water, respectively. The CN heterojunction peaks, seen
in the range of 1200–1640 cm-1 , reflect the presence of
C-N and C=N bonds within the material. Triazine ring
structures are confirmed by peaks at 806 and 735 cm-1 ,
and a peak around 885 cm-1 corresponds to C-H bond
vibrations, further confirming the successful synthesis of

g-C3 N4 [25].
The FTIR spectrum of the g-C3 N4 /rGO composite
catalyst shows the characteristic peaks of g-C3 N4 , affirming its presence in the composite. In addition, a distinct
peak related to the C=C bond appears around 980 cm-1 ,
indicating the successful formation of the composite material. This peak signifies the integration of graphene
oxide into the graphite carbon nitride matrix, enhancing
its structural and electronic properties [23].

FIG. 4: FTIR spectra of rGO, g-C3 N4 , and

The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of pure g-C3 N4 ,
rGO, and the composite catalysts are presented in Figure 5. To determine the value of the energy gap, the Tauc
plot, which is a graph of (αhv)2 versus photon energy
(hv), was utilized [26]. The energy gap can be calculated
in electron volts (eV) using the following equation:
E=

hc
γ

or E = hv

(1)

In these equations, “α” represents the absorption coefficient at a specific wavelength, “h” is Planck’s constant,
“c” is the speed of light, “γ” is the wavelength of radiation,
and “v” is the frequency of light. The energy gap values
are obtained by drawing a tangent line on the curve at
the points where the curve rises with a steep slope in the
Tauc plot [26]. According to Figure 5a, rGO has a very
low band gap, which can accelerate electron-hole recombination. However, when rGO is added to g-C3 N4 , it
enhances the performance of g-C3 N4 in the visible light
range by reducing its large band gap [23].
The band gap values for g-C3 N4 , g-C3 N4 /rGO-1, and
rGO are 2.89 eV, 2.80 eV, and 1.98 eV respectively. Correspondingly, the activation wavelengths are 429 nm,
443 nm, and 626 nm, respectively.
The valence band (VB) is crucial for determining the
photooxidation characteristics of the photocatalyst. The

VB edge potential can be calculated using the energy
gap (Eg ) and the conduction band (CB) edge potentials. Mott-Schottky plots, with the reference electrode
of Li+ /Li, can be used to determine the CB potential, as
the conduction band is approximately equal to the flat
band potential [23].
To obtain the conduction band potentials, a tangent
line is drawn on the Mott-Schottky plots at the points
where the curve rises with a steep slope. Figure 6 shows
the Mott-Schottky plots of pure g-C3 N4 , rGO, and gC3 N4 /rGO-1. To convert the results of Mott-Schottky
plots from the reference electrode of Ag/AgCl to the reference electrode of Li+ /Li, a value of 3.26 is added as
a change in the potential value of the conduction band
measured with the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This
shift gives the potential value of the conduction band
with the Li+ /Li reference electrode.
According to the slope of the curves, all photocatalysts are n-type. The potential values of the conduction bands, valence bands, and the energy gaps for
the synthesized catalysts are listed in Table I. These
values provide insight into the electronic structure and
photo-electrocatalytic performance of the g-C3 N4 /rGO
composite, confirming its potential effectiveness in the
electro-Fenton process for removing pollutants.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic analysis was
employed to evaluate the suppression of electron-hole recombination in the synthesized catalysts, pure g-C3 N4 ,
and rGO. The results are presented in Figure 7.
For the g-C3 N4 /rGO nanocomposite, the presence of
rGO significantly decreases the fluorescence intensity.
This reduction in fluorescence is attributed to rGO acting
as an electron collector, which facilitates more efficient
electron-hole separation in the g-C3 N4 /rGO composites.
The enhanced separation of charge carriers is expected to
improve the overall photo-electrocatalytic performance of
the system [27].
Furthermore, the decrease in the peak intensity of the
PL spectra indicates an increase in structural defects
within the composite [28]. These defects can serve as
active sites for catalytic reactions, thereby further enhancing the efficiency of the photo-electrocatalyst. This
dual effect of improved charge separation and increased
active sites underscores the potential of the g-C3 N4 /rGO
composite in applications such as the electro-Fenton process for removing emerging pollutants.
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was conducted to determine the specific surface area of the
synthesized nanoparticles, and the results are presented
in Table II. Catalytic reactions are typically surfacedependent, meaning that the reaction rate generally increases with a larger surface area.
However, as shown in Table II, the specific surface areas of the catalysts do not differ significantly. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the efficiency of these catalysts
is more closely related to their electron transfer mecha-

Effect of pH

The pH of the solution is a critical parameter influencing the progress of reactions in Fenton-based processes.
The results of levofloxacin (LEV) removal at different pH
levels are presented in Figure 8a. As shown in this figure, the removal efficiency of levofloxacin over 90 minutes
of reaction time was 72.87% at pH 2, 87.46% at pH 4,
and 86.62% at pH 6, with the highest removal efficiency
observed at pH 4.
In electro-Fenton-based processes, acidic pH levels exhibit much higher efficiency compared to basic pH levels [39]. This is because the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), which is the primary reactant in the Fenton reaction, increases in acidic conditions according to
the following reaction:
O2 (g) + 2H+ + 2e− → H2 O2

nisms rather than their surface areas. The enhanced performance observed in the g-C3 N4 /rGO composites can be
attributed to the improved electron-hole separation and
increased structural defects, as indicated by the photoluminescence and Mott-Schottky analyses. These factors
collectively enhance the catalytic activity, emphasizing
the importance of electronic properties over mere surface
area in this context.

However, at pH levels below 3, hydrogen peroxide is
converted into oxonium ion through the following reaction [40], which diminishes the efficiency of the Fenton
reaction:
H2 O 2 + H + → H3 O +

(pH < 3)

Numerous studies have reported that the optimal
pH for the electro-Fenton process is between 3 and

electro-Fenton and photocatalytic processes further supports the optimal performance of this process at pH=4.
This combination likely enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species and improves the degradation efficiency of pollutants such as levofloxacin.
4.2.

Effect of Catalyst Concentration

The amount of catalyst used is another critical parameter in photo-electro-Fenton processes. The catalyst in
this process enhances the production rate of hydroxyl
radicals by generating electron-hole pairs, thereby increasing pollutant removal [43]. The results of LEV removal with different catalyst concentrations are shown in
Figure 8b.
As illustrated in Figure 8b, the optimal catalyst concentration for this process is 120 mg/L, with a removal efficiency of 87.46%. The removal efficiency increases with
increasing catalyst concentration from 60 to 120 mg/L
but decreases beyond this point. The removal efficiencies
of levofloxacin at catalyst concentrations of 60 mg/L and
240 mg/L are 85.98% and 81.00%, respectively, after 90
minutes of reaction.
The decrease in removal efficiency at higher catalyst

concentrations can be attributed to several factors. Excessive catalyst amounts may lead to aggregation, reducing the effective surface area and hindering light penetration. Aggregation can scatter light, decreasing the number of photons reaching the catalyst surface [34]. Additionally, high concentrations of photocatalysts can limit
mass transfer and prevent the diffusion of reactants to the
active sites on the catalyst surface [44], thus reducing the
rate of pollutant removal.
4.3.

Effect of Current Density

Since the production of hydrogen peroxide through Reaction 2 is directly dependent on the current intensity, optimizing this parameter is crucial for the photo-electroFenton process. In addition, energy consumption costs
highlight the importance of optimizing current density.
The results of investigating the effect of current density
on LEV removal are presented in Figure 8c.
As shown in Figure 8c, the removal efficiency of levofloxacin increased with increasing current density from
30 to 50 mA/cm2 during 90 minutes of reaction, reaching a maximum value of 87.46% at 50 mA/cm2 . Beyond
this point, the removal efficiency decreased. The removal
efficiencies at 30 mA/cm2 and 100 mA/cm2 were 57.55%

and 84.92%, respectively. Although the percentage of removal at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 was the highest after 30 minutes, the significant increase in energy
consumption at this current density makes it economically unfeasible.
The decrease in efficiency at current densities above
50 mA/cm2 can be attributed to the conversion of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen to water at high current
densities, as described by the following reaction [42]:
O2 (g) + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2 O

(4)

Additionally, high current densities can lead to the excessive production of active species such as hydroxyl radicals on the electrode surface. Although these species are
crucial for pollutant removal, their overproduction can
stimulate side reactions, reducing the overall efficiency.
Furthermore, increasing current intensity raises the likelihood of oxygen production at the anode and hydrogen
production at the cathode. This shift decreases the production of hydrogen peroxide, thereby lowering the process efficiency [45].
4.4.

Effect of Aeration

One of the key advantages of electro-Fenton-based processes is the production of hydrogen peroxide via electrochemical methods, facilitated by aeration at the cathode
during the process [46]. Therefore, it is essential to optimize the amount of aeration to enhance system performance while minimizing economic costs. The results of
the tests determining the optimal aeration level for this
process are presented in Figure 8d.
As shown in this figure, increasing the aeration rate
from 0.2 L/min (with a removal efficiency of 84.99%) to
0.4 L/min improves the system’s performance, achieving
the highest removal efficiency of 87.46%. Beyond this
point, the removal efficiency remains almost constant,
reaching 87.55% at an aeration rate of 0.6 L/min during
90 minutes of reaction.
Increasing the aeration rate to the optimal level enhances the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water,
thereby maximizing H2 O2 production. This increase in
H2 O2 production is directly related to the higher gen-

eration of hydroxyl radicals, which are crucial for pollutant removal. However, beyond the optimal aeration
rate, the process efficiency plateaus. This plateau occurs
because the dissolved oxygen in the water reaches saturation [45]. Furthermore, excess oxygen bubbles increase
the resistance of the solution and the likelihood of side
reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, which can reduce
overall process efficiency [47].
By determining the optimal aeration point, we can
improve the efficiency of the electro-Fenton process for
levofloxacin removal, ensuring effective treatment of
wastewater while keeping economic costs in check.

4.5.

Effect of Catalyst Composition

Three different combinations of catalysts were synthesized to investigate the optimal composition of gC3 N4 /rGO for the efficient removal of LEV using the
photo-electro-Fenton method. The results of the efficiency of the removal of levofloxacin using these photoelectrocatalysts are presented in Figure 8e.
As shown in Figure 8e, the pollutant removal efficiency
increases with the increase of rGO in the catalyst up to
1%, after which the removal efficiency decreases. The
synthesized catalyst exhibited the highest pollutant removal rate of 87.46% at a composition of 1% rGO. In this
composition, the synergistic effect of the g-C3 N4 photocatalyst and the rGO electrocatalyst likely enhances performance. The removal efficiencies for the compositions
of 0.1% and 10% rGO were 85.07% and 84.38%, respectively.
At very high concentrations of rGO, aggregation and
masking of the active surface area are the primary causes
of the diminished overall efficiency of the catalyst [48].
Furthermore, the BET results confirm the aggregation
at very high concentrations of rGO.
By optimizing the composition of the catalyst, particularly the ratio of g-C3 N4 to rGO, we can significantly
improve the efficiency of the electro-Fenton process for
the removal of levofloxacin, ensuring effective wastewater treatment.

Determination of Reaction Kinetics

4.8.

Determining the degradation kinetics is crucial for designing effective treatment systems for wastewater. The
degradation kinetics of levofloxacin were modeled using
a first-order reaction, which accurately predicted levofloxacin concentrations over time with very low error,
consistent with the experimental data. The reaction kinetics are described by the following equation:

ln

C
C0


= −Kt

(5)

Where C is the concentration of levofloxacin at time t,
C0 is the initial concentration of levofloxacin, and K is
the reaction rate constant.
The reaction rate constants were measured under different conditions and presented in Figure 8. The results provide valuable insight into optimizing the process
conditions to achieve maximum efficiency in levofloxacin
degradation.

Comparison of Photocatalyst,
Electro-Fenton-like, and
Photo-Electro-Fenton-like Processes

Comparison of g -C3 N4 and g -C3 N4 /rGO
efficiency in electro fenton process

To evaluate the synthesized catalyst, the efficiency of
the photo-electro-Fenton process for LEV removal with
the composite catalyst was compared to the pure g-C3 N4
catalyst. The results of this comparison are shown in
Figure 9.
As seen in Figure 9, the heterojunction of g-C3 N4 rGO
enhances the separation of photo-generated electron-hole
pairs [27], thereby increasing the progress of the following
reaction and overall efficiency:
H2 O2 + e− → ·OH + OH−

(6)

The g-C3 N4 /rGO composite generates active species, in+
cluding ·OH, O·−
2 , and h , through the photoelectric synergy between rGO and g-C3 N4 [50]. This significantly
accelerates the degradation efficiency of levofloxacin.
The efficacy of pollutant removal in the process using the g-C3 N4 catalyst and the g-C3 N4 /rGO composite
was 80.42% and 87.46%, respectively. These results indicate that the g-C3 N4 /rGO-1 composite catalyst is more
effective than pure g-C3 N4 , highlighting the benefits of
combining g-C3 N4 with rGO for enhanced photo-electroFenton performance.

4.7.

To investigate the effects of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes and their combination on LEV removal, the best catalyst composition was used under optimal conditions determined for these three processes.
The results are shown in Figure 8f.
As depicted in Figure 8f, both photocatalyst and
electro-Fenton-like processes are capable of removing levofloxacin. However, the synergistic effect of combining
these processes significantly enhances the performance of
the photo-electro-Fenton-like process.
The removal efficiencies for the photocatalyst, electroFenton-like, and photo-electro-Fenton-like processes are
43.77%, 80.15%, and 87.46%, respectively. These results
clearly demonstrate that the combination of photocatalytic and Fenton-based processes leads to a higher efficacy in pollutant removal. The synergistic effect arises
from the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and improved electron-hole separation [49], which
accelerate the degradation of levofloxacin.
By leveraging the strengths of both photocatalytic and
electro-Fenton-like processes, the photo-electro-Fentonlike process offers a more efficient and effective method
for wastewater treatment, achieving higher removal rates
of emerging pollutants such as levofloxacin.

Conclusion

In this project, g-C3 N4 and rGO composite was synthesized from graphene oxide and urea precursors. To
ensure the correct synthesis of the catalysts, various
analyses such as FE-SEM, XRD, FTIR, PL, and MottSchottky were utilized. These composites were then employed as the main catalysts in a photo-electro-Fentonlike system to investigate their performance in removing
levofloxacin, a model antibiotic. The optimal conditions
for the process were determined to be: current density
= 50 mA/cm2 , aeration rate = 0.4 L/min, pH = 4, and
120 mg/L of the 1% reduced graphene oxide composite
catalyst. The performance of the process was compared
with systems containing pure g-C3 N4 catalysts. Furthermore, the photocatalytic process, electro-Fenton-like process, and photo-electro-Fenton-like process, all using gC3 N4 /rGO as their main catalyst, were compared. Additionally, the reaction kinetics was studied under different
conditions. The kinetics was found to follow a first-order
reaction model.
Table III provides a comparison of the conditions, catalysts, and pollutants used in electro-Fenton-based processes from this study and those reported in other articles. This comparison serves as a valuable roadmap for
future research, highlighting the advancements made and
identifying areas for further exploration.
