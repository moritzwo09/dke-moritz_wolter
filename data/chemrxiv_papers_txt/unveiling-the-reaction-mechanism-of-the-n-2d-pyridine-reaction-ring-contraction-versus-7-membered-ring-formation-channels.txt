ABSTRACT: Despite the relevance of the reactions of the prototypical nitrogen-containing sixmembered aromatic molecule (N-heterocyclic) of pyridine (C6H5N) in environmental science,
astrochemistry,

science,

prebiotic

chemistry,

and

material

science,

few

experimental/theoretical studies exist on the bimolecular reactions involving pyridine and neutral
atomic/molecular radicals. We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the
elementary reaction of pyridine with excited nitrogen atoms, N(2D), aimed at providing
information on the primary reaction products and their branching fractions (BFs). From previous
crossed molecular beam (CMB) experiments with mass-spectrometric detection and present
synergistic calculations of the reactive potential energy surface (PES) and product BFs we have
unveiled the reaction mechanism. It is found that the reaction proceeds via N(2D) barrierless
addition to pyridine that, via bridged intermediates followed by N atom “sliding” into the ring,
leads to 7-membered ring structures. They further evolve, mainly via ring-contraction mechanisms
toward 5-membered ring radical products and, to a smaller extent, via H-displacement mechanisms
toward 7-membered ring isomeric products and their isomers. Using the theoretical statistical
estimates, an improved fit of the experimental data previously reported has been obtained leading

 0.20), C3H3N2 (1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl) + C2H2 (BF = 0.11  0.06), and C5H4N2 (7membered ring molecules or pyrrole carbonitriles) + H (BF = 0.28  0.10). The ring-contraction
product channels C4H4N (pyrrolyl) + HCN, C3H3N2 (1H-imidazolyl) + C2H2, C3H3N2 (1Hpyrazolyl) + C2H2, and C5H5 (cyclopentadienyl) + N2 have statistical BFs of 0.54, 0.09, 0.11, and
0.07, respectively. Among the H-displacement channels, the cyclic-CHCHCHCHNCN + H
channel and cyclic-CHCHCHCHCN2 + H are theoretically predicted to have a comparable BF
(0.07 and 0.06, respectively), while the other isomeric 7-membered ring molecule + H channel has
a BF or 0.03. Pyrrole-carbonitriles and 1H-ethynyl-1H-imidazole (+ H) isomeric channels have an
overall BF = 0.03. Implications for the chemistry of Saturn’s moon Titan and prebiotic chemistry,
as well as for understanding the N-doping of graphene or carbon nanotubes, are noted.

1. INTRODUCTION
Pyridine, the simplest azarene with gross formula C5H5N, is largely used as an intermediate for
the manufacture of bioactive products, such as medicines, herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.1
While it is not abundant in nature, its derivatives are part of important biomolecules such as niacin
(Vitamin B3), pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.2-5 Some
pyridine derivatives were identified in carbonaceous chondrites and also in the pristine sample of
the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu collected by the Hayabusa2 mission.6 Its derivative
nicotinonitrile (3-cyanopyridine) is one of the molecules synthesized in a version of the StanleyMiller experiment with C2H4/NH3 mixtures.7 Because of that and considering that it is an organic
molecule simple enough to be synthesized in abiotic processes, it has been searched also in the
interstellar medium and in the atmosphere of Titan (the massive moon of Saturn) where a plethora
of N-containing organic molecules have been already identified.8 In the case of Titan, the presence
of protonated pyridine and pyrimidine was speculated by the analysis of the mass spectra recorded
by the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft,9 but ground-based
attempts to verify that by using the ALMA telescope could not confirm its presence and only upper
limits were derived.10 Nonetheless, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and N-containing
PAHs (N-heterocyclic compounds and aromatic amines) have been invoked11 to explain the strong
unidentified emission near 3.28 μm recorded by Dinelli et al.12 In addition, the analysis of the data
recorded by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer Ion Beam Spectrometer (CAPS-IBS) strongly
suggests that PAHs and N-containing PAHs are responsible for the heavy positive ion signal
recorded at 170–310 Da.13 PAHs and NPAHs are also considered as the carriers of the unidentified
spectral bands (namely, the diffuse interstellar bands and the unidentified infrared bands) detected
in several regions of the interstellar medium,14 but neither pyridine nor any other individual Ncontaining aromatic compounds have been identified in the interstellar medium, and only upper
limits for pyridine abundance were reported in C-rich circumstellar envelopes to date.15 Several
pyridine formation routes in both cold and hot extraterrestrial environments have been proposed1621

and, therefore, its missing detection suggests the presence of efficient destructive processes that

deplete gaseous C5H5N.22 For instance, in O-rich environments, the reaction with atomic oxygen
is efficient in degrading it with the main products being pyrrole and CO.23 In the upper atmosphere
of Titan, an important active species that could consume pyridine, as well as other aromatic

compounds, is atomic nitrogen in its first excited state 2D. N(2D) can be formed by various N2
dissociation processes, including extreme ultra-violet (EUV) photolysis, but also dissociative
photoionization, dissociation via electron impact, galactic cosmic ray absorption, and N2+
dissociative recombination (see Ref. 24 and references therein). The 2D state is metastable with
radiative lifetimes of 13.6 and 36.7 hours for 2D3/2 and 2D5/2, respectively,25,26 and is known to be
very reactive with saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons27-35as well as with nitriles,3638

water39,40 and H2/D2.41,42
Until recently, not much was known on the reactivity of N(2D) with aromatic compounds. In a

recent paper, a combined experimental and theoretical study on the reaction N(2D) + benzene was
reported.43 Experimentally, the reaction was studied under single-collision conditions by the
crossed molecular beams (CMB) scattering method with mass spectrometric detection (MS) and
time-of-flight (TOF) analysis and in a continuous supersonic flow reactor. The global rate constant
as a function of temperature from 50 K to 296 K and the product branching fractions (BFs) were
determined.43 In addition, electronic structure calculations of the reactive potential energy surface
(PES) were performed, and the product BFs were also determined via RRKM/ME (RiceRamsperger-Kassel-Marcus/Master Equation) estimates.43 The absence of an entrance barrier in
the derived PES corroborated the experimental data on the rate coefficients which were found to
be in the gas-kinetic range (ca. 2 × 10−10 cm3 s−1) over the 50–296 K range of temperatures
investigated. Experimental and theoretical BFs agree in identifying the ring-contraction channel
leading to C5H5 (cyclopentadienyl) and HCN to be largely dominant.43
Another reason to pursue the study of N(2D) reactions with aromatic compounds is to
understand the N-doping of graphene or carbon nanotubes via the use of plasma. N-doped
graphene is an interesting material for electrocatalysis and biosensing applications.44-46 According
to the data available, N-doped graphene includes graphitic N atoms (with the nitrogen atom in the
graphene plane), pyridinic N and pyrrolic N atoms.44-46 Among the different methods to dope
graphene, the nitrogen plasma treatment is a simple approach that allows efficient material surface
modification.44-46

of atomic nitrogen.47 Further investigation48 revealed that the reactions of N(2D,2P) with the cation
of toluene are able to form bridged intermediates of the same kind we have found for the reaction
N(2D) + C6H6.43 From that bridged structure, the N atom “slides” into the ring forming a 7membered structure that can then evolve further.
In a recent Letter we reported the results of a CMB study of the title reaction at a collision
energy (Ec) of 33.5 kJ/mol with a preliminary analysis of the experimental data.49 From the data
analysis, we were able to identify two main groups of product channels: a group of channels
associated with H-displacement mechanisms accompanied by the formation of a variety of
isomeric C5H4N2 co-products, and a group associated with the formation of two heavy co-products,
corresponding to ring-contraction mechanisms and elimination of HCN and/or C2H2, CN, and N2.
Since the resolution in determining the product translational energy was not good enough to
distinguish among isobaric products, we could not provide detailed BFs. Nevertheless, from the
backward-forward symmetric shape of the product angular distributions, it resulted quite clearly
that the reactive system behaves statistically.49 This has motivated us to pursue a theoretical
characterization of the PES and of RRKM BFs, in spite of the difficulties expected after the work
done for N(2D) + C6H6 and in consideration of the symmetry loss in the case of pyridine.
Here, we report quantum chemical calculations of the C5H5N2 PES as well as RRKM/ME
computations of the product BFs at the collision energy of the CMB experiment and as a function
of temperature. The theoretical work warranted an improved analysis of the earlier CMB
experimental data and a reconsideration of the global product BFs.
From the combined experimental/theoretical results a clearer picture of the N(2D) + pyridine
reaction mechanism, including the product channel distribution, has emerged. Overall, the
approach is the same that we employed for the investigation of a variety of reactions between
N(2D) and saturated29,30 and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons,33-35 simple nitriles,36-38 as well as
benzene.43
The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the theoretical and experimental
methods, respectively. Section 4 presents the theoretical results, while section 5 summarizes the
improved analysis of the earlier experimental data and the comparison with the theoretical
predictions. Discussion follows in section 6 and Conclusions are given in section 7.

2. THEORETICAL METHODS
2.1. Electronic structure calculations of the potential energy surface. The N(2D) + C5H5N
reaction PES was investigated adopting a well-established computational strategy previously used
for the characterization of similar bimolecular reactions.34-36,43,50-52 In detail, the lowest stationary
points (minima and transition states) were located at the B3LYP53,54 level of theory, in conjunction
with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set.55,56 The optimization of the stationary points was then refined
using the same hybrid density functional with a larger basis set, i.e., the Dunning correlation
consistent valence polarized aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.57-59 Harmonic vibrational frequencies were
computed at the same level of theory in order to check the nature of the stationary points, i.e.
minimum if all the frequencies are real, saddle point if there is one, and only one, imaginary
frequency. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations60,61 were performed to assign the
identified saddle points. All the energies were corrected to 0 K by adding the zero-point-energy
(ZPE) correction computed using the scaled harmonic vibrational frequencies, evaluated at the
B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level. The energy of N(2D) was estimated by adding the experimental62
separation N(4S)–N(2D) of 230 kJ/mol to the energy of N(4S) at all levels of calculation.
Furthermore, the exothermicity of the main product channels, which were demonstrated to be
relevant from RRKM calculations, was evaluated performing more accurate calculations at the
CCSD(T) level corrected with a Density Fitted (DF) MP2 extrapolation to the complete basis set
(CBS) and with corrections for core electron excitations. In particular, the energies were computed
as:

ECBS= E(CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ)+[E(CCSD(T,core)/cc-pVTZ)-E(CCSD(T)/ccpVTZ)]+[E(DF-MP2/CBS)-E(DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ)]

where E(DF-MP2/CBS) is defined as:

E(DF-MP2/CBS) = E[(DF-MP2)/aug-cc-pVQZ]+0.5772*[E(DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ)-E(DFMP2/aug-cc-pVTZ)]
The E(DF-MP2/CBS) extrapolation was performed using Martin’s two parameter scheme.63

Since the accuracy of our best computed values should not be better than the “chemical accuracy”
of 1 kcal/mol (4.184 kJ/mol), we rounded all the reported energies to 1 kJ/mol. All DFT
calculations were performed using Gaussian 0964 while the CBS calculations were performed
using MOLPRO.65,66 The analysis of the vibrational frequencies was performed using Avogadro.67
2.2. Statistical estimates of the product branching fractions (BFs). Statistical RRKM
calculations for the N(2D) + C5H5N reaction were carried out using a code implemented in our
group for this purpose.36,50-52,68 The microcanonical rate constant k(E) for a specific reaction, at a
𝑁

𝑇𝑆
specific total energy, is given by the expression69 𝑘(𝐸) = ℎ𝜌(𝐸)
where N(E) represents the sum of

states of the transition state at energy E, ρ(E) is the density of states of the reactants, and h is
Planck’s constant. N(E) is obtained by integrating the relevant density of states (DOS) up to energy
E, and the rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator model is assumed. Where possible, tunneling (as well as
quantum reflection) was included in the RRKM calculations using the corresponding imaginary
frequency of the transition state and calculating the tunneling probability for the corresponding
Eckart barrier. For the cases in which we were not able to locate a clear transition state in the exit
channel, the corresponding microcanonical rate constant was obtained through a variational
approach: k(E) was evaluated at various points along the reaction coordinate and the point which
minimizes the rate constant was chosen, in accordance with the variational theory.70 In some cases,
however, that approach could not be employed because of some difficulties in the electronic
structure calculations of the intermediate points, and the transition state was assumed as the
products at infinite separation. After the calculation of all microcanonical rate constants, a Markov
(stochastic) matrix was set up for all intermediates and final channels to derive the product
branching fractions for the overall reaction. Finally, a Boltzmann averaging allowed us to obtain
the branching fractions for each product channel as a function of temperature.
RRKM/ME calculations were carried out individually for initial intermediates resulting from
the addition of N(2D) to pyridine in our PES. We have identified, indeed, six possible
intermediates, all formed without an entrance barrier according to our calculations (see Figure 1;
see also Figure S1 of the Supplementary Information for the scan of the entrance channels pointing
to absence of a barrier for those approaches). In cases like this, it is not easy to estimate the global
value of the product BFs because it is not possible to establish how the initial reaction flux is
distributed among the initial intermediates. In a purely statistical approach, however, we can
assume that the initial association process between the reactants is partitioned between the various

intermediates based on their DOS, calculated considering their relative energy (that is, the well
depths associated with them) and the values of vibrational frequencies and rotational constants.
The rotational densities of states were calculated using an inverse Laplace transform of the
corresponding partition functions. Subsequently, a convolution between the rotational densities of
states and the corresponding vibrational ones was performed using a direct count algorithm.
The strong assumption here is that, when the two reactants start interacting in the long-range
potential region, the system already behaves statistically.

identified leading to six different addition intermediates (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory) (see text).

3. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
The details of the CMB experiment were reported in our previous Letter.49 Briefly, using a CMB
apparatus described elsewhere,71-74 two continuous supersonic beams of the reactants were crossed
at 90o under single-collision conditions in a large scattering chamber kept at 1.510-6 mbar in
operating conditions. The detector (a tunable electron impact ionizer followed by a quadrupole

mass filter and a Daly type ion detector) can be rotated in the plane of the reactants and a chopper
wheel can be used to measure the TOF distributions of the reactants (using the single-shot
configuration) and products (using the pseudorandom configuration). The atomic nitrogen beam
was produced by a radio-frequency discharge source where high dissociation (about 60%) of N2 is
achieved. Atomic nitrogen, produced in a distribution of electronic states, was characterized in our
laboratory by Stern-Gerlach magnetic analysis.75 72% of N atoms are in the 4S ground state, while
21% and 7% in the metastable excited states 2D and 2P states, respectively. The presence of N(4S)
and N(2P) in the beam does not affect our experiments as already observed in the other reactions
that we have investigated with the same source. Details on the experimental conditions and beam
production can be found in Ref. 49. The experimental collision energy, Ec, and the center-of-mass
angle, CM, were 33.5 kJ/mol and 66.5°, respectively.
Product angular distributions, N(Θ), were measured in the laboratory (LAB) reference frame
by modulating at 160 Hz the pyridine beam for background subtraction. Product TOF distributions
were measured by the pseudo-random chopping method at 6 μs/channel. Pivotal to the success of
the experiments has been the use of soft-ionization at 17 eV electron energy to suppress or mitigate
interferences from dissociative ionization processes of reactants, products and background
gases.71,76 In this kind of experiments, quantitative information is obtained by moving from the
LAB coordinate system to the center-of-mass (CM) one and analyzing the best-fit product angular,
T(), and translational energy, P(E′T), distributions into which the total CM product flux, ICM(,
E′T)total, can be factorized.71 The best-fit CM functions are derived by a forward convolution fit of
the total product LAB angular and TOF distributions. When at a certain mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)
value we observe the contributions from more than one channel, the convolution routine makes
use of the equation ICM(, E′T)total = i wi [T()P(E′T)i], where the wi parameters represent the
relative contribution of the apparent integral cross section of the ith channel and are determined
during the best-fit procedure.71,76 The wi parameters enter in the evaluation of the product channel
BFs, as described elsewhere.71
In our previous Letter, during the data analysis we were only able to disentangle two groups of
reaction channels: the H-displacement channels and the ring-contraction channels. Because of the
low resolution and unfavorable kinematics, we could not distinguish among the possible isomeric
co-products in the H-displacement channels nor the almost isobaric co-products of the

HCN/C2H2/CN/N2 formation channels. Here, a more detailed analysis of the experimental
distributions guided by the theoretical BFs is presented (see below).

4. THEORETICAL RESULTS
4.1. Potential energy surface. The characterization of the PES has been a daunting task due
to the different possible attacks in the ortho, meta, para, and ipso positions and bridge additions.
Also, the first intermediates formed following the initial addition steps can isomerize to many other
intermediates before reaching the exit channels. Indeed, as already observed for the N(2D) +
benzene reaction,43 the large input energy provided by the electronically excited atomic nitrogen
and the ability of N and C to form three and four bonds, respectively, lead to a notable number of
possible rearrangements, all accessible because the involved transition states are below the total
energy associated with the asymptote of the reactants. To reduce the cost the calculations, a
preliminary scrutiny of the PES was performed at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. Many
different pathways were identified in this first screen, but some of them are obviously not
competitive (and, therefore, are expected to be minor) because of the presence of very high
transition states and/or numerous rearrangements before reaching the product exit channel. For

this reason, we carried out RRKM calculations to identify the reaction pathways that give a nonnegligible contribution and for them we repeated the calculations at the more accurate B3LYP/augcc-pVTZ level of theory. Finally, the enthalpy changes of the main channels were recalculated at
the very accurate CBS level. RRKM calculations of the BFs were also repeated considering the
more accurate energy of the stationary points along the relevant reaction channels. The structure
(in terms of cartesian coordinates) of the stationary points identified in the PESs are reported in
the Supporting Information (Table S1).
As already mentioned six initial intermediates have been identified upon the N(2D) attack to

the pyridine ring. All of them are formed without an entrance barrier, as in the case of the similar
N(2D) + C6H6 reaction.43 In Figure 1 a close-up of the entrance channel of the global PES is
illustrated. The addition of N(2D) in the para position (pathway 1 in the Figure 1) leads to the
formation of the i1 intermediate which is located 214 kJ/mol below the reactant energy asymptote.
By overcoming a very small barrier (associated with transition state T3), i1 easily isomerizes to i3
(located at −332 kJ/mol) which is characterized by the presence of a 3-membered ring in a bridged
10

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-clrtd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4371-149X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

structure. The i3 intermediate can also be formed directly by bridge addition of N(2D) to carbon
atoms at the meta and para positions (pathway 3). The addition of N(2D) in the meta position
(pathway 2 in the Figure 1) leads to the formation of the i2 intermediate which is located 224
kJ/mol below the reactant energy asymptote. By overcoming very small barriers (associated with
T1 and T21), i2 easily isomerizes to i3 or to i6 (located at −341 kJ/mol), another intermediate
characterized by the presence of a 3-membered ring in a bridged structure. The i6 intermediate can
also be formed directly by bridge addition of N(2D) to carbon atoms at the ortho and meta positions
(pathway 4). It should be noted that, with our calculations, we were unable to identify a structure

similar to i1 and i2 but with the nitrogen atom added in the ortho position. Any attempt in this
direction has always led to the i6 bridged structure upon optimization. This result may indicate
that the structure formed by addition at the ortho position is not stable or that any transition state
prior to its isomerization to i6 is so small that it cannot be computationally identified because of
the convergence to the i6 structure when performing optimization. We have tested numerous other
DFT methods without being able to isolate that structure. As a matter of fact, also the i1 and i2
intermediates have to overcome very small barriers of ca. 1 kJ/mol to isomerize into the
corresponding bridged structures, but those were sufficient to allow the identification of their
structures upon optimization. The lack of an ortho-addition intermediate and the very small
isomerization barriers for i1 and i2 pose other problems on how to handle the different initial
intermediates for RRKM estimates of BFs (see below). Finally, N(2D) can add also at the ipso
position forming the i1-i intermediate (−361 kJ/mol) that holds a N-N σ bond (pathway 5). By
overcoming a barrier of 140 kJ/mol, i1-i can isomerize to i2-i, another intermediate characterized
by the presence of a 3-membered ring in a bridged structure. Also in this case, i2-i can be formed
directly by bridge addition of N(2D) to carbon atoms at the ipso and ortho positions (pathway 6).
After these initial steps, many possible reaction pathways can occur. Here we will comment
and further inspect only those pathways that make an appreciable contribution to the most
significant reaction channels (see Figures 2-4) according to our RRKM calculations. Other
pathways that we were able to identify along the PES (but which do not contribute significantly)
are shown in Figures S2–S5 of the Supporting Information for completeness.
Once formed (either in pathways 1, 2 or 3), the i3 intermediate can isomerize to i4 (located
454 kJ/mol below the energy of the reactants), a 7-membered ring species with two nitrogen atoms
in the ring (see Figure 2). The associated transition state, T4, (+10 kJ/mol with respect to i3) clearly

shows the breaking of a C-C bond that allows the N atom to “slide” into the ring. In turn, the i4
intermediate can directly dissociate to the products of channel (11), one of the H-displacement
mechanisms. The calculated enthalpy change of channel (11) is −129 kJ/mol. Alternatively, i4 can
follow the path T5 → i30 → T7 → i7→ T13, leading to the products pyrrolyl radical (C4H4N) +
hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (channel (1)). Additionally, a different isomerization path, T6 → i8 →
T9→ i9→ T12, is responsible for the formation of the 1H-imidazolyl radical and acetylene
(channel (3)). The global reaction enthalpy of the two product channels (1) and (3) are −427 kJ/mol
and −297 kJ/mol, respectively, at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.
On the other hand, whether formed in pathways 2 or 4, the i6 intermediate isomerizes to i17
(located 466 kJ/mol below the reactant energy asymptote), another 7-membered ring species with
two N-atoms in the ring formed via the fission of a C-C bond and the “sliding” of the N-atom into
the ring (a small barrier represented by T22 is easily overcome – see Figure 3). The 7-membered
ring i17 intermediate can isomerize to i23 and then to i7 leading ultimately to the already described
pyrrolyl + HCN product channel (1) through the path T28 → i23 → T33→ i7→ T13. A different
exit channel from i17 is represented by H-loss with formation of the product channel (2) (H00=
−174 kJ/mol) in a barrierless fashion (see Figure 3). A competing H-loss channel starting from i17
is associated with the C4H4N-CN (1-cyano-N-cyclopentadiene) co-fragment (channel (7)),

accessible via the path i17 →T24 → i19 → T26→ i21→ T35. Other possible product channels,
originating from different isomerization processes, are characterized by the formation of
C4NH4CN (3-cyano-N-cyclopentadiene) + H (channel (9) (see Figures 2 and 3)), C3H3NN-CCH +
H (channel (10) (see Figure 2)), and 1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2 (channel (4) (see Figures 2 and 4).
Finally, i2-i (whether formed directly or by the isomerization of i1-i in pathways 5 and 6) easily
evolves toward another 7-membered ring intermediate (i3-i) by overcoming a barrier of 5 kJ/mol
associated with T2-i (see Figure 4). Once formed, the i3-i intermediate can directly dissociate,
leading to the formation of H + cyclic-CHCHCHCHCN2 (another 7-membered ring species)
(channel (6)) in a barrier-less process. Alternatively, several isomerization processes can take
place. Formation of pyrrolyl + hydrogen cyanide products (channel (1)) is possible through the
path T3-i → i4-i → T6-i → i7-i → T10-i. Alternatively, a ring contraction channel leading to the
elimination of molecular nitrogen and the formation of cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) radical (channel
(5)) is possible via the sequence T4-i → i5-i → T9-i. This is the most exothermic channel of the
global PES with a H00 of −574 kJ/mol at this level of theory. Another pathway originating from
i3-i leads to the formation of 1H-pyrazolyl + acetylene (channel (4)), through the T5-i → i6-i →
T8-i → i15 → T18 reaction path. The i15 intermediate is a species which is formed also in
pathways 1, 2, and 3 (see Figure 2). Finally, another H-loss channel leading to the C4NH4CN
(pyrrole-2-carbonitrile) co-fragment (channel (8)) (see Figure 4), starting from i7-i is possible
(from i6-i there is also a higher energy path to channel (4) via T7-i → i8-i → T12-i).
In conclusion, from our electronic structure calculations of the global PES, we have identified
the 11 main exothermic product channels which are listed below (a 12th channel is also considered
because in our previous analysis of the experimental results we considered a CN formation
channel):

→ C4NH4-CN(2H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile) + H

→ C4NH4-CN(3H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile) + H

While the channel notation is the same used in the Figures 2-4, here the reaction enthalpies are
those obtained at the more accurate CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory (these values are in parentheses
in the Figures 2-4). As visible, there is reasonable agreement with the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ values
(with the largest deviation being ca. 20 kJ/mol), thus corroborating the choice of the method to
derive the entire PES. The reason why the reaction enthalpies for some channels differ up to about
20 kJ/mol can be due to correlation effects, which are better taken in account in the case of
CCSD(T)/CBS calculations
The structures of the main molecular products are shown in Figure 5.

In addition to the five ring-contraction channels and seven H-displacement channels,
abstraction of an H atom by N(2D) is also possible, forming NH and three different (ortho, meta,
and para) pyridinyl radicals C5H4N. These channels are calculated at the CBS level to be
exothermic by 114, 95, and 89 kJ/mol for o-, m-, and p-attack, respectively. We were unable to
locate a transition state for the H-abstraction, even though the presence of an entrance barrier is
expected. To be noted that in the related system O(1D) + benzene, a submerged transition state was
located for the analogous H-abstraction mechanism.77 Despite that, the calculated BF for the Habstraction mechanism was found to be minor (confirmed by the experimental results).77
Overall, the PES obtained for the N(2D) + C5H5N reaction is similar in many aspects to the one
developed for the N(2D) + C6H6 reaction.43 Because of the symmetry loss due to the presence of a
nitrogen atom in the structure of pyridine, the global C5H5N2 PES is much more complex and a
larger number of reaction pathways and product channels are present.
4.2. RRKM/ME estimates of the product branching fractions. RRKM estimates of product
BFs were performed at the collision energy of the CMB experiment49 and for two different
temperatures, 200 K and 300 K, corresponding to the temperature of Titan’s atmosphere at 1000
km of altitude (where the molar fraction of N(2D) has its peak)78 and room temperature,
respectively. The calculated BFs refer to the zero-pressure limit, which nicely simulates the
conditions of the CMB experiments and is a good approximation of the very low pressure of the
thermosphere of Titan. The RRKM approach allows the calculations of unimolecular processes
(isomerizations and dissociations) of reaction intermediates. Three sets of independent
calculations were carried out starting from the intermediates i3, i6 and i2-i because (i) i1 and i2
promptly isomerize to i3 and i6 because T2 and T1/T21 are degenerate with their minima and (ii)
the only destiny of i1-i is to isomerize to i2-i. In the Tables 1-3 the channel specific BFs are
reported at the CMB Ec and for T = 50, 200 and 300 K (the values at 50 K are shown to see the
possible trend by decreasing the available energy).
In all cases and under all considered conditions, the dominant channel is the one leading to
C4H4N(pyrrolyl) + HCN (channel (1)) with a BF varying from 0.614 (i3), 0.687 (i6), and 0.583
(i2-i) at 50 K to 0.545 (i3), 0.558 (i6), and 0.538 (i2-i) under the conditions of the CMB experiment.
The second channel by importance when starting from i3 and i6 is the 1H-imidazolyl + C2H2
channel (3) with BFs of 0.254 (i3) and 0.197 (i6) at 50 K that decrease to 0.239 (i3) and 0.173 (i6)
under CMB conditions. Channel (3) is minor in the case of the i2-i PES portion where, instead, the

As already mentioned, there are no obvious ways to quantify how the reactive flux is distributed

channel leading to the isomeric product (1H-pyrazolyl) and C2H2 (channel (4)) has comparable
BFs (0.196 at 50 K and 0.197 under CMB conditions). The formation of one or more 7-membered
ring products with different structures is always significant, with the largest yield associated with
the formation of cyclic-CHCHCHCHNCN in channel (2) from i6 (0.093 at 50 K and 0.229 under
CMB conditions). The channels (5) leading to cyclopentadienyl + N2 is also significant when
considering the i2-i PES portion. All the other product channels appear to contribute marginally to
the global reactive flux, showing very small values of BFs. Overall, there is a mild dependence on
the available energy for most channels. Nevertheless, the yields of the 7-membered ring products
clearly increase with the total energy while the yield of the main channel (pyrrolyl + HCN)
decreases. We were unable to estimate the possible contributions of the H-abstraction mechanisms,
but we expect them to be minor by analogy with the O(1D) + C6H6 reaction.
As already mentioned, there are no obvious ways to quantify how the reactive flux is
distributed among the different initial intermediates because all pathways 1-6 were found to be
barrierless (see Figure S1). Therefore, we decided to treat the system as statistical already in the
first portion of the PES associated with the entrance channels. Given the absence of the ortho
addition intermediate and the very reduced stability of intermediates i1 and i2 (which readily
isomerize to i3 and i6 due to the very low transition states involved), we estimated the partitioning
of the reactive flux by considering the DOS of the i3, i6 and i1-i/i2-i intermediates, i.e. the first
intermediates along the pathways 1-6 that can have a significant lifetime. This is a rather rough
approximation that, however, does not affect the BF of the most important channels while it has
some effect on the minor ones.
For this reason, we propose the global BFs calculated in this way in Table 4, to be compared
with the experimental data. We remind the reader that we do not distinguish 1H-pyrazolyl from
1H-imidazolyl or the possible H-displacement isomeric products experimentally.
The DOS values, that depend on the relative energy of the stationary points and on geometrical
parameters (which affects the values of vibrational frequencies and rotational constants), are
reported in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. In the evaluation of the relative importance of
the partial BFs associated with i3, i6 and i1-i/i2-i we have multiplied by a factor of 2 those of i3,
i6 and i2-i because of the possibility of a symmetrical bridge addition.
Overall, by inspecting both the partial and global values of the BFs, the title reaction is
characterized by the competition between three main reaction channels: (i) ring-contraction

followed by formation of the pyrrolyl radical and HCN (common to all identified pathways), (ii)
H loss, to form essentially a 7-membered ring co-product (whose structure is different for the
different pathways) and (iii) ring-contraction followed by formation of 1H-imidazolyl/1Hpyrazolyl radical and acetylene.

methodology at 300 K and 200 K are also reported.

5. IMPROVED ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND COMPARISON WITH
THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
Our preliminary analysis of the experimental data reported in Ref. 49 indicated the occurrence
of two main classes of product channels associated with (i) H-displacement or (ii) ring-contraction
mechanisms with the formation of two heavy products. As already noted in Ref. 49, the
experimental resolution did not permit us to disentangle the relative contributions of the various
19

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-clrtd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4371-149X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

possible isomeric C5H4N2 co-products of the H-displacement channels or to assess the relative
contributions of the heavier co-products of energetically possible HCN, C2H2, CN, and N2 forming
channels. Therefore, the preliminary best-fit was carried out using only two sets of T(θ) and P(E'T)
functions, one referring to a global H-displacement channel (assuming that the most probable Hchannels was the most exothermic one) and the other to the HCN forming channel (expected to be
the main ring-contraction channel by analogy with the N(2D) + benzene reaction, as assessed in
our recent publication43). Using this approach, we could not well reproduce the detailed shapes of
product angular distributions simultaneously at both m/z = 65 and 66.49 However, in the absence
of theoretical support, a fit using more than two contributions was not warranted. At the time we
anticipated that theoretical work on the full PES was planned.
After the PES and RRKM predictions of product BFs performed in the present work, we can
now reconsider the preliminary fit of the data by exploiting the theoretical predictions to assist a
more detailed interpretation of the experimental results. It is important to underline that the shapes
of the CM product angular distributions derived in the preliminary fit of Ref. 49 are clearly
indicating that the reaction proceeds via the formation of a long-lived complex,79 thus justifying
the use of an RRKM approach. The revision of the LAB data fit has the aim to verify whether the
experimental data can be reproduced using the theoretical BFs or whether BFs somewhat different
from the theoretical ones are actually required. This approach ultimately leads to the elucidation
of the detailed reaction mechanism.
We recall that reactive scattering signals were observed49 at:
(a) m/z = 92 (C5H4N2+), which is the mass of the parent ion of the molecular co-product in all
the energetically open H-displacement channels (2, 6-11) (see Figures 2-4 of the PES);
(b) m/z = 91 (C5H3N2+), which is the (−1) daughter ion of the m/z = 92 product;
(c) m/z = 67 (C4H5N+), which could be the mass of the parent ion of 1H-imidazolyl and 1Hpyrazolyl radicals possibly produced in channels (3) and (4), respectively, and/or of the
pyrrole isomer produced in channel (12). Note that daughter ions of co-products associated
to the H-displacement channels at this m/z are not expected, because it would require the
emission of a C2H moiety in the dissociative ionization process, an unlikely process;
(d) m/z = 66 (C4H4N+), which is either the mass of the parent ion of the pyrrolyl radical
(channel (1)) or the (−1) daughter ion of 1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl and pyrrole from

channel (3), (4), and (12), respectively. Note that daughter ions from co-products associated
to the H-displacement channels can also contribute to this m/z signal;
(e) m/z = 65 (C4H3N+), which can be associated to daughter ions of the molecular/radical
products of all channels mentioned above, including channel (5);
(f) m/z = 41, a likely daughter ion from heavy co-products of H-displacement channels, and
perhaps from also ring-contraction channels.
The velocity vector (so called “Newton”) diagram for the N(2D) + pyridine experiment is
depicted in Figure 6. In the figure the circles superimposed on the Newton diagram correspond to
the maximum velocity that each indicated product can attain by assuming that all the total available
energy ETOT (ETOT = Ec − ΔH00) is channeled into product translational energy. Only the four
products predicted by RRKM to be most abundant (see Table 4) are shown. The circles related to
the H-displacement channels have been represented with just one circle which refers to the
statistically most favored H-forming channel (2) leading to cyclic-CHCHCHCHNCN (indicated
as C5H4N2 in Figure 6) formation; the corresponding circles for the heavy co-products of the other
slightly less or more exothermic H- forming channels would have only slightly smaller or larger
radius, respectively, and would barely be discernible on the scale of the figure. The Newton
diagram reported here is different with respect to the one reported in Ref. 49, where the circle
related to the H-displacement channels was drawn by considering the most exothermic H-forming
channel (7) leading to 1H-pyrrole-1-carbonitrile (C5H4N2), the circles associated with C4H4N
(pyrrolyl) (+ HCN) and with C4H5N (3H-pyrrole) (+ CN) were shown, and the two circles
associated with the C2H2 forming channels were missing.
Note that in the previous report49 the relative intensities at m/z = 92, 67, 66, 65, and 41 were
erroneously reported as 1.00, 0.08, 0.28 0.91, and 0.94. A careful revision has indicated that in the
signal at m/z = 92 was included an incorrect intensity of also the daughter ion m/z = 91. In addition,
the m/z = 67 small intensity was based only on a single measurement at the peak of the angular
distribution and could not be verified whether all signal was clean reactive signal and, as such, it
was not included in the estimate of the product BFs. Full angular distribution data were only
recorded at m/z = 66 and 65, which correspond to the parent ion and the (−1) daughter ion of the
pyrrolyl radical as well as from the (−1) daughter ion of the imidazolyl and pyrazolyl radicals but
could also in part arise from daughter ions of the co-products of H-forming channels. Because the
pyrrolyl component can be separated from that of the H-forming channels, we know the ratio

concentric circles delimit the maximum velocity that the possible indicated primary products can attain in the CM
system if all the available energy goes into product translational energy. The circles delimit also the LAB angular
range within which the indicated primary products can be scattered. The four most relevant reactive channels are
indicated: C5H4N2 (+ H) (red circle), drawn by considering the energetic of channel (2) which has the largest RRKM

(parent ion)/((−1) daughter ion) of pyrrolyl. In the revision we have assumed that at 17 eV the
reactive signal at m/z = 67 could only be due to the parent ion of the imidazolyl/pyrazolyl, in a
fraction (0.35) with respect to the (−1) daughter ion equal to that of pyrrolyl. After this correction,
the most intense reactive signal is associated with m/z = 41. The revised relative intensities of the
reactive signal at m/z = 92, 91, 67, 66, 65, and 41 (at 17 eV electron energy) are 0.73, 0.17, 0.003,
0.30, 0.97, and 1.00, respectively at Θ = 68 (which is close to the CM angle). Finally, as pyrrolyl
does not give significant (-2) ion intensity at 17 eV, we have assumed the same for
imidazolyl/pyrazolyl. These assumptions appear to be supported by the data analysis and
theoretical predictions of BFs (see section 5.1 for the present overall revision of the product BFs).
The relative amount of mass 67 contributing to the small, total reactive signal corresponding to
imidazolyl/pyrazolyl products, is only 24% of the total, the main amount appearing at the (−1)
daughter ion m/z = 66. Since the experimentally estimated BF of the C2H2 elimination channels

(which could include also the N2 elimination channel) is 0.11  0.06 (see Table 4), we think that
the uncertainty associated to the m/z = 67 relative contribution is accounted for in the large error
bars of more than 50% for the BF of these channels.
As discussed in Ref. 49, angular distributions were measured for only m/z = 92, 66, 65, and 41,
because the signal-to-noise ratio at m/z = 91 and 67 was too low. The angular distribution at m/z =
92, 66, 65, and 41 are portrayed in the Figures 7(a), 7(b), 7(c), and 7(d), respectively. Note that the
error bars at m/z = 41 are considerably larger than at m/z = 65, despite the similar reactive signals,
because the background in the detector at m/z = 41 was substantially higher than at m/z = 65. In
contrast, TOF distributions were only measured for m/z = 65, which yielded the best signal-tonoise (S/N) ratio and carries the fingerprints of both H-displacement and ring-contraction channels.
The TOF distributions at m/z = 65 for three different LAB angles are shown in Figure 8.
The reported measurements at m/z = 92 were performed using 70 eV electron energy (count
rate 30 counts/s), while for m/z = 66, 65, and 41 soft electron ionization at 17 eV was employed,
because it permitted a significant reduction of interferences from fragmentation of higher mass
species. For m/z = 92, a measurement at the CM angle using 17 eV electron energy (count rate 11
counts/s) was also acquired for normalization purposes. Count rate for m/z = 41 was 15 counts/s
at 17 eV.
As can be seen from Figure 7(d), the m/z = 41 angular distribution is, within the error bars,
similar to that measured at m/z = 92, indicating that it originates from dissociative ionization of
the heavy co-product(s) of the H-displacement channel(s). In contrast, the LAB angular
distributions measured at m/z = 66 and 65 (see Figures 7(b) and 7(c)), while exhibiting the central
part (peaked around the CM angle) similar to the m/z = 92 distribution (see Figure 7(a)), exhibit a
clear tail (or shoulder) extending significantly towards smaller angles (forward direction) (the
backward direction could not be explored because measurements beyond 80° were not possible
due to the closeness to the detector of the direction of the pyridine beam). This indicates that other
reactive contributions are also present in the m/z = 66 and 65 angular distributions, arising from
other channels besides those contributing to m/z = 92 and 41, and exhibiting very different
kinematics and dynamics.
It should be noted (see Figures 7(b) and 7(c)) that the contribution of the tail (or shoulder) (at
small angles) to the angular distributions, with respect to the main peak centered around the CM,

is lower for m/z = 65 than for m/z = 66. Since we recorded only a weak signal at m/z = 67 (parent
ion of pyrrole, and also of imidazolyl/pyrazolyl) and we know that pyrrole fragments little (about
7% at 300 K and 70 eV electron energy) to the (−1) daughter ion m/z = 66 and none to m/z = 65,
the strong reactive signal at m/z = 65 cannot be attributed to a (−2) daughter ion of pyrrole,
especially at 17 eV electron energy, but rather it reflects the (−1) daughter ion of the pyrrolyl
radical (parent mass 66), which is instead expected to fragment substantially in the ionizer to m/z
= 65, even at 17 eV. We remind that m/z = 67 also corresponds to the parent mass of
imidazolyl/pyrazolyl, which are expected to fragment substantially to the (−1) daughter ion of 66
(similarly as pyrrolyl fragments substantially to the (−1) daughter ion). That is, we do not expect

imidazolyl/pyrazolyl to fragment significantly to m/z = 65. Therefore, we have indication that
signals observed at m/z = 66 and 65 come mainly from the pyrrolyl radical (with HCN co-product)
from channel (1)) rather than from the pyrrole (or isomer of it) (with CN co-product) from channel
(12); but, notably, imidazolyl/pyrazolyl from channels (3)/(4) can also contribute somewhat to the
m/z = 66 signal, as well as being responsible of a small reactive signal observed at the parent mass
m/z = 67.
Since from the above arguments we have ruled out the occurrence of the CN forming channel
(and this is corroborated by theory which finds it to have a negligible BF), and considering that
theory predicts the N2 forming channel to have a BF of only 0.07 and the pyrazolyl/imidazolyl
forming channels of 0.11/0.09 (see Table 4), we have attempted a more refined best-fit of the
experimental data than we did in the earlier Letter,49 using in the simulations the statistically
predicted

BFs

of

the

three

main

channels

(H-displacement,

HCN

forming,

and

pyrazolyl/imidazolyl (theoretical global BF = 0.20) forming), to verify whether they are consistent
with the experimental data. Therefore, the simultaneous best-fit of the product angular and TOF
distributions at m/z = 66 and 65 was carried out using three different sets of T(θ) and P(E' T)
functions, one set associated with the theoretically predicted predominant H forming channel (2)
(BF = 0.07), and the other two sets to the pyrrolyl + HCN channel (1) (BF = 0.54) and 1Himidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2 channels (3) and (4) (global BF = 0.20). These channels are
theoretically the most sizeable product channels (see Table 4). Within this simulation the functions
associated to channel (2) can also reflect other H-displacement channels which cannot be
disentangled experimentally. That is, these T(θ) and P(E'T) functions are overall best-fit functions
for H-displacement channels. Analogously, the functions associated to channel (3) (BF = 0.09) can
also encompass channel (4) (pyrazolyl, BF = 0.011).
As can be seen from the Figures 7 and 8 the new, improved best-fit of the data is rather good.
In particular, with respect to the original, simplified best-fit analysis of Ref. 49, it has been possible
to account for the different relative contributions of the small angle shoulder in the angular
distributions at m/z = 66 and 65. Specifically, this indicates that 1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl
(parent mass 67) fragments more to m/z = 66 than to m/z = 65 with respect to pyrrolyl (parent mass
66) that fragments strongly to m/z = 65). That is, 1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl are mainly detected
at m/z = 66 (the fraction at m/z = 67 is estimated using the previously estimated fragmentation of

pyrrolyl); in fact, the contribution of 1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl is negligible in the simulation
of the angular distribution at m/z = 65) (see Figure 7(c)).
The corresponding best-fit CM T(θ) and P(E'T) functions for the three dominant channels (2),
(1), and (3)/(4), used to simulate the data in the present, improved fit, are shown in Figure 9. It can
be appreciated that also in the revised fit the T()s of the three main channels are backwardforward symmetric (although with a somewhat different degree of polarization), and this indicates
that the reaction proceeds via a long-lived complex mechanism79 confirming that it can be treated
with a statistical approach, as done here. The hatched areas in Figure 9 represent the CM functions
that still afford an acceptable fit of the data.
The P(E'T) distribution (Figure 9-rhs) for the H-displacement channel(s) peaks away from zero
(at about 40 kJ/mol) with a tail extending up to slightly above 200 kJ/mol. In the figure, the total
available energies (𝐄𝐓𝐎𝐓 ) for channels (2), (7), and (6) are indicated with arrows. Based on those
characteristics we cannot exclude that also H-displacement channels other than (2) and (6) do
contribute to the reactive signal, including the most exothermic channel (7), because the molecular
product can be formed in highly excited internal states. The fraction of the total energy released as
product translational energy, 〈fT〉, relative to the maximum E'T of the prominent channel (2), is
0.40. Since the P(E'T), within its error bars, extends beyond the ETOT for channel (2), a small
fraction of also channel (7) is likely to contribute. Indeed, the P(E'T) for the overall forming
channels (Figure 9-rhs-top panel) is well consistent with predominant channels (2) and (6) and a
minor channel (7). Note that theory predicts an overall BF of 0.19 for the H forming channels,
with specifically BF = 0.07, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 for the channels (2), (6), (11) and (7-10),
respectively (see Table 4). Note also that the contribution of channel (7) is calculated to be the
largest one among the minor four H-channels (7-10) listed in the Tables 1-3, that give an overall
BF = 0.03 (see Table 4). Overall, the experimental BF of 0.28  0.10 agrees, within the error bars,
with the theoretical BF of 0.19 for all the H-displacement channels.
The P(E'T) of the HCN forming channel (1) dies off at the maximum total available energy of
this channel, and <fT> is 0.32, indicating that 68% of the total available energy goes into internal
excitation of the pyrrolyl and HCN products (see Figure 9-rhs-middle panel). The data at m/z = 65
could also contain some contribution from the parent ion of cyclopentadienyl (+ N2) (channel (5));
however, experimentally we are not sensitive to this contribution, which theoretically is predicted
to be minor (BF of 0.07 vs 0.54) with respect to the dominant pyrrolyl (+ HCN) channel (1). Also

the P(E'T) of the 1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2 channels (3) and (4) dies off at about ETOT
of the most exothermic of the two channels and reflects a <fT> of 0.35 (for 1H-imidazolyl), which
implies that about 65% of the total available energy goes into internal (ro-vibrational) excitation
of the molecular/radical co-products.

preliminary estimate of the product BFs taking in account, in addition to the improved 3-channels
analysis described here, (i) the corrections of the relative intensity at m/z = 92, 91, and 67 described
above and (ii) a different fragmentation pattern of the pyrrolyl and imidazolyl/pyrazolyl radicals
to the (−1) daughter ion which is now assumed to be similar. At 17 eV the parent and the (−1)
daughter ions are in the ratio 0.35/1.00, with an overall contribution at lower daughter ion
fragments very small (ca. 0.11), as inferred from the dramatic reduction of the fragmentation of
pyrrole (both at 300 K and 900 K, the latter mimicking an internally hot reaction product) when
the ionizing electron energy is lowered from 70 eV to 17 eV.
The experimental BFs derived in the present analysis are given in Table 4. Experimentally we
could achieve an improved best-fit of the data with three main sets of product channels: that
corresponding to H-displacements, with overall BF = 0.28  0.10, and those corresponding to two
ring-contraction channels. Of the latter channels, one (dominant) is channel (1) leading to pyrrolyl
+ HCN (BF = 0.61  0.20) while the other one leads to 1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2
(channels (3)/(4), BF = 0.11  0.06). Remarkably, now the ratio of the BFs of the ring-contraction
and H-displacement channels, (0.720.20)/(0.280.10) is reversed with respect to the value of
(0.350.15)/(0.650.20) estimated in the previous report. The main reason of this difference
comes, within the 3-channel analysis suggested by theory, from the estimate of the similar
fragmentation pattern of the pyrrolyl and imidazolyl/pyrazolyl radical products. Note that the
information from theory about the dominant relevance of the pyrrolyl channel (1) and the
imidazolyl/pyrazolyl channels (3) and (4) has been crucial. The new product BFs are also much
more in line with the experimental/theoretical study on the related N(2D) + C6H6 reaction, for
which the HCN formation was largely dominant. Those findings prompted the present theoretical
work and the re-analysis of the CMB data of Ref. 49.
Experimentally, the ratio between the ring-contraction channels and the H-displacement
channels is about 2.61.5, and this is somewhat lower than the value of about 4.3 predicted by
theory. In fact, as can be seen in Table 4, according to the theoretical predictions, the dominant
product channel at Ec = 33.5 kJ/mol is channel (1) leading to pyrrolyl + HCN (BF = 0.54). Among
the possible ring-contraction channels, second in importance are channels (4)/(3) leading to (1Hpyrazolyl)/(1H-imidazolyl) + C2H2 (BF = 0.11 and 0.09, respectively), with formation of 1Hpyrazolyl + C2H2 (BF = 0.09) mainly occurring from the i-addition (see Table 3) (and only in very
minor part (see Table 1) from other pathways). Notably, cyclopentadienyl + N2 (channel (5)), only

formed from ipso addition (see Table 3), has a smaller BF of 0.07. The third most important
channels are those leading to the 7-membered ring (cyclic-CHCHCHCHNCN) + H (channel (2)
(BF = 0.07), with the other two isomeric 7-membered ring product channel (6) and (11) having BF
= 0.06 and 0.03, respectively (see Table 4). Four other isomeric H-displacement channels being
minor, with global BF = 0.03 for channels (7-10), among which channels (7) and (8) give the
largest contribution (see Tables 2 and 3).

DISCUSSION

In discussing the present experimental/theoretical results on the N(2D) + pyridine reaction it is
useful to refer to the experimental/theoretical results recently published on the related N(2D) +
benzene reaction that we studied at the comparable collision energy of 31.8 kJ/mol. 43 The latter
reaction was found to proceed via barrierless addition of N(2D) to the aromatic ring of benzene,
followed by the formation of several cyclic (five-, six-, and seven-membered ring) intermediates
that undergo unimolecular decomposition to bimolecular products. The large value of the rate
coefficient (ca. 2  10-10 cm3 s−1 over the 50–296 K explored range) corroborated the theoretical
prediction of a barrierless reaction.43 At the Ec of 31.8 kJ/mol the ring-contraction channel was
experimentally found to be largely dominant (BF = 0.92  0.04), with a minor contribution (BF =
0.08  0.04) coming from H-displacement channels. Theoretically, it was possible to disentangle
the observed ring-contraction channel into two contributions: a dominant C5H5 + HCN product
channel (BF = 0.745) and a minor C4H4N (pyrrolyl) + C2H2 product channel (BF = 0.056). At the
same time, the H-displacement channels were theoretically predicted to be associated to the
formation

of

o-C6H5N

(o-N-cycloheptatriene

radical)

(BF

0.135),

C5H5CN

(cyanocyclopentadiene) + H (BF = 0.053), and p-C6H5N (p-N-cycloheptatriene radical) + H (BF
= 0.011). A mild dependence of the BFs on the temperature (or Ec) was noted, mostly affecting
only the o-C6H5N + H vs the HCN channels relative yield.
After the data analysis revision presented here, the reaction mechanism of N(2D) with the
isoelectronic pyridine turns out to be quite similar to that with benzene as the ring contraction
channel(s) are now dominant while the H-displacement channels are minor. However, the
experimental BF for the H-displacement channels is substantially larger for N(2D) + pyridine (by
more than a factor of two) than for N(2D) + benzene (BF = 0.28  0.10 vs 0.08  0.04). Also the

theoretical calculations point to some differences, with a smaller BF for the HCN channels (BF of
0.54 for pyridine vs 0.745 for benzene), a larger BF for the C2H2 channels (3) and (4) (global BF
of 0.20 for pyridine vs 0.056 for benzene), and a similar BF for the H-displacement channels
(global BF of 0.19 vs 0.199) (see Table 2 in Ref. 43 for N(2D) + benzene BFs). The small yield of
1H-pyrrole-1-carbonitrile/2H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile/3H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile in channels (7-9)
predicted for the N(2D) + pyridine reaction has the equivalent (cyano-cyclopentadiene) in N(2D)
+ benzene also formed with a small BF.43 The very small yield of the 1H-ethynyl-1H-imidazole +
H channel has its counterpart in very small yield of the channel leading to 1-ethynyl-1H-pyrrole +
H in the reaction with benzene.
As for channels (1) and (12) (HCN + C4H4N and CN + C4H5N products, respectively),
statistical calculations indicated that the situation is similar to that incurred in the related N(2D) +
benzene reaction,43 where a dominant yield was predicted for the HCN channel and a negligible
one for the CN channel. Clearly, similarities as well as differences are present when comparing
the two systems.
We note that formation of C4H4N2 (pyrimidine) + CH, a weakly exothermic channel (H00 =
−59 kJ/mol) (not listed) could not be experimentally probed because its parent mass (m/z = 80)
would be fully masked by the intense elastic peak of the very intense pyridine beam (mass 79) due
to the 13C natural isotope abundance. However, it was predicted to have a negligible BF in our
RRKM calculations. Similar results were found in the reaction N(2D) + benzene for the analogous
channel leading to pyridine + CH (a similarly weakly exoergic channel) that was predicted by
statistical RRKM calculations to be negligible with respect to H displacement and ring contraction
channels.43,82,83
The present results have some implications both on the chemistry of the atmosphere of Titan
as well as on N-doping of graphene in plasmas. Concerning the chemistry of Titan, our results
contribute to clarifying the chemistry involving N-aromatic species. As already noted in the
Introduction, pyridine has been searched for in the atmosphere of Titan but a dedicated ALMA
campaign could only derive an upper limit ∼1.15 ppb above 300 km assuming a constant profile.
According to current photochemical models, the mole fraction of N(2D) becomes significant above
an altitude of 800 km78,84 and a signal at m/z=80 (possibly protonated pyridine or one of its
isomers) was recorded by INMS onboard Cassini between 1027 and 1200 km.13 There are possible
formation routes of pyridine including ion-molecule reactions9 or the neutral-neutral reactions CH

+ pyrrole,85 CN + 1,3-butadiene16-19 and N(2D) + benzene.43,82,83 Our results indicate that, even if
formed, pyridine can quickly undergo a chemical reaction with N(2D) itself causing mostly ringcontraction processes, either with formation of the pyrrolyl radical + HCN or with formation of
1H-imidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2 and (to a lesser extent) of N2 + cyclopentadienyl radical. The
H-displacement channels are mainly represented by the formation of 7-membered ring radicals
and, to a minor amount, of 1H-pyrrole-1-carbonitrile/2H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile/3H-pyrrole-3carbonitrile in channels (7-9). If formed, the possible fate of these species in the conditions of Titan
will be to further react with the most abundant molecules and radicals at that altitude. In particular,
as already noted in the case of the o-C6H5N radical formed in the N(2D) + benzene reaction,43 their
reactions with atomic hydrogen (which is present in the thermosphere of Titan) will convert the 7membered ring radicals formed in channels (2), (6) and (11) into pyrrolyl radical + HCN or 1Himidazolyl/1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2, as can be clearly appreciated from the PES of Figures 2-4, once
the 7-membered ring radicals and H act as reactants. 1H-pyrrole-1-carbonitrile/2H-pyrrole-2carbonitrile/3H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile and 1-ethynyl-1H-imidazole, instead, are closed-shell
species that could accumulate under the conditions of Titan. Regarding the fate of the pyrrolyl
radical, we note that, according to our CMB results on its formation channel, only 32% of the
available energy goes into product translational energy, leaving 68% of it as internal energy of the
two products. That means that the pyrrolyl radical can be formed with enough internal energy to
decompose into C2H2 + CH2CN, a process that needs +245.3 kJ/mol to overcome the highest
transition state along the pyrrolyl decomposing pathway.86 In conclusion, under the conditions of
Titan, the title reaction will either lead to the formation of small aromatic or highly unsaturated Nrich cyclic compounds (thus contributing to the building-up of those complex structures that are
called into play to either explain the IR emission band at 3.28 µm or the CAPS-IBS mass
spectrum11-13) or to a significant degradation of pyridine toward much smaller and abundant
moieties like HCN, C2H2, CH2CN. Furthermore, the title reaction can be considered an efficient
destruction route of pyridine that adds to the other possible reactions with charged species18 and
cannot be considered a formation route of pyrimidine.
Concerning the implication for the N-doping of graphene via the use of plasmas, we note here
that the results we have obtained on this system as well on the related N( 2D) + benzene reaction
can contribute to clarify the mechanism at play. It has been shown that the longer the exposure to
the nitrogen plasma, the larger the number of nitrogen atoms that enter into the structure of
32

graphene will be. This is fully consistent with the results we have seen here as no reduction of
reactivity is expected for the title reaction (in which the aromatic ring already contains nitrogen)
with respect to the case of benzene since both are barrierless reactions. Also, the global reaction
mechanisms are very similar and the only contribution that reduces the N-content of the molecular
structure, that is the channel leading to N2 + C5H5, was seen to be minor, even though it is the most
exothermic channel of the title reaction. The analysis of the structure of N-doped graphite indicates
the presence of 7-membered and 5-membered rings upon nitrogenation. This is also consistent
with the structures that we have identified along the PES. Obviously, in the case of the N(2D)
reaction with graphene, most of the degrees of freedom which are typical of a gas phase reaction
will be lost and the structures which are similar to those of the intermediates shown in Figures 24 are expected to be stabilized.

CONCLUSIONS

The PES of the reaction N(2D) + C5H5N was calculated theoretically and the product BFs were
derived from RRKM/ME statistical computations. The electronic structure calculations of the PES
indicate that the reaction proceeds by barrierless addition of N(2D) to pyridine. Some assumptions
of how to partition the initial reactive flux were necessary. A revised analysis of previous CMB
experimental data gave product BFs that are in line with the present theoretical predictions. Two
main types of mechanisms are ruling the overall reaction: H-displacement and ring-contraction.
The ring-contraction mechanisms leading to pyrrolyl + hydrogen cyanide and to 1Himidazolyl/pyrazolyl + acetylene (and possibly also to some cyclopentadienyl + N2) were found
to be dominant in the CMB experiments (with BF of 0.61  0.20 and 0.11  0.06, respectively), in
good agreement with RRKM predictions according to which the channel leading to pyrrolyl +
HCN (BF = 0.54) and to 1H-pyrazolyl + C2H2 (BF = 0.11) and 1H-imidazolyl + C2H2 (BF = 0.09)
dominate. H-displacement channels give a significant contribution in the CMB experiments (BF
= 0.28  0.10) as well as in the RRKM estimates (overall BF = 0.19), corresponding to the
following channels: cyclic-CHCHCHCHNCN + H (channel (2)) (BF = 0.07), cyclicCHCHCHCHCN2 + H (channel (6) (BF = 0.06), cyclic-CHCHNCHCHCN + H (channel (11) (BF
= 0.03), and several isomeric C5H4N2 + H channels (overall BF = 0.03).
Pyrimidine is not formed through an N/CH exchange channel.

It is quite interesting that the main products of the title reaction are the pyrrolyl and
imidazolyl/pyrazolyl radicals. These radical intermediates play key roles in atmospheric
chemistry, combustion, biochemistry, and many other chemical processes due to their high
reactivity. Numerous photochemistry experiments have been carried out on pyrrolyl and
imidazolyl radicals and, very recently,87 also direct spectroscopic measurements (using highresolution photoelectron imaging and photodetachment spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled
pyrrolide and imidazolide anions) have been reported to probe the electronic structure and
spectroscopy of these important radicals.
The effect of increasing the energy available to the system is modest. Some competition
between the ring-contraction channels (mainly pyrrolyl + HCN) and the H-displacement channels
leading to 7-membered-ring molecules + H can be appreciated and rationalized by considering that
a larger internal energy content will favor the prompt dissociation of the 7-membered intermediates
against their isomerization. Under the conditions relevant for Titan thermosphere (T = 200 K), the
yield of pyrrolyl (C4H4N) increases while that of the main 7-membered ring channels decreases
with respect to the CMB conditions. The BF of the other very minor channels are not so sensitive
to temperature. This information may be useful for theoretical modeling of the atmosphere of
Titan.
A more general conclusion is that aromatic rings are not so resistant to the chemical attack as
commonly believed, at least not in the case of very energetic reactants like electronically excited
species. This is the fifth case we have investigated where ring-contraction of small aromatics
(benzene or pyridine) is a significant (if not the dominant) reaction pathway, after O(3P,1D) +
benzene (significant in the case of the 3P reaction, dominant in the case of the 1D reaction),88,89
O(3P,1D) + pyridine (largely dominant in both cases),23 O(3P,1D) + toluene (significant in the case
of the 3P reaction, dominant in the case of the 1D reaction)90 and N(2D) + benzene (largely
dominant).43 It will be interesting to verify whether a similar mechanism is present also in the case
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as naphthalene, which are supposed to accumulate in
various environments because of their chemical stability.
A comment on the possible implications for prebiotic chemistry is in order. Our results indicate
that the title reaction is an efficient destruction route of pyridine, provided that N atoms in the first
electronically excited state can be produced by the photolysis of molecular nitrogen or other
mechanisms. Such processes are active in the atmosphere of Titan and might have been possible

in the unshielded primitive terrestrial atmosphere. Contrary to what was previously suggested, not
only is the N(2D) + pyridine reaction not a viable way to produce pyrimidine, but it rather helps
prevent pyridine buildup. It would have been very interesting to find a mechanism for the
formation of the pyrimidine which is the backbone ring structure of several key biological
molecules, that is, the nucleobases uracil (in RNA), cytosine (in RNA and DNA), and thymine (in
DNA). Other formation routes will need to be explored.
Finally, the present results as well as those on the N(2D) + C6H6 reaction help in understanding
the mechanism of N-doping graphene via the use of plasma.
