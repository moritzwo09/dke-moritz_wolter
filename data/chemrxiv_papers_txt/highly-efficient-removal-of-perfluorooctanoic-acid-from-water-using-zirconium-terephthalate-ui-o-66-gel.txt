Abstract: The extensive use and environmental release of
perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever
chemicals”, has raised significant health and environmental concerns.
Due to their persistence and resistance to natural degradation, PFAS
appear in concerningly high concentrations, e.g., in our drinking water.
Among these substances, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is
particularly prevalent. This study explores the application of
synthesized zirconium terephthalate (UiO-66) metal-organic
framework (MOF) gel for highly efficient removal of PFOA from water.
The UiO-66 gel not only maintains the structural stability of its powder
form but also offers improved ease of handling. Structural
characterization by PXRD and TEM analyses revealed the gel's
nanocrystalline structure (~20 nm in size), which was further
confirmed by electron diffraction. Quantitative NMR spectroscopy
demonstrated a PFOA removal efficiency of 96%. The successful
absorption of the polyfluoro compound into the UiO-66 gel after
filtration was confirmed by the detection of fluoride within the gel
structure using STEM-EDS elemental mapping. In addition, to
demonstrate the potential of developing membrane platforms as
practical and scalable solutions for environmental remediation, the
performance of a MOF gel filter was successfully tested.

use in pollutant removal in water[17] and air[18] and specifically for
the harvesting of PFAS[19–23]. Their primary applicability relies on
producing a microcrystalline powder, limiting their use in platforms
that require increased packeting therefore hindering a scalability
as filter membranes.
Zhou et al.[22,24] have reported the molecular mechanism of MOFs
to harvest PFAS, while Wong et al. have shown the importance of
a high defect density in the MOF structure to enhance PFOA
harvesting.[25] However, MOFs in powder form still have several
disadvantages in practical applications.[26] They exhibit poor
processability and handling[27] and poor hierarchical pore control
due to their extensive crystalline structure.[28], mass transfer
limitations in packed beds and columns[27,28], and limitations in
assembly into practical devices due to the limited mechanical
support of the microcrystalline powder[29]. Over the years,
scientists have investigated MOF in gel form rather than in powder
form as these gels can as well self-assemble into discrete
crystalline nanoparticles[30], forming a colloidal network that
aggregates in a liquid phase[31]. MOF-gels represent a highly
defective and hierarchical porous structures[32–34] and thereby
exhibit enhanced performance in catalysis and gas storage[35],
better mechanical stability compared to MOF-powders[28] and high
versatility in forming into various shapes such as coatings, films,
membranes, and monoliths[27,28,36].

The increasing prevalence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
a class of molecules used in our society since the 1940s for their
chemical stability, has raised significant health and environmental
concerns due to their persistence and widespread use[1]. These
chemicals, often called 'forever chemicals,' persist in the
environment due to their resistance to natural degradation.[2]
PFAS contamination occurs mainly in surface waters and
therefore also leads to contamination in foods such as fish and
seafood.[2] Among these PFAS molecules, perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) is one of the most commonly used. Given the urgency,
practical solutions are needed to remove PFOA from
contaminated water, ensuring the access to safe drinking water
and effective wastewater treatment.
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), are known as extensive
crystalline materials[3–6] with immense applicability in many
fields[7–9] such as catalysis[10,11], gas separation[12], sensing[13–15]
and molecular sieving[16]. Another significant application is their

In the field of water filtration, methods such as ultrafiltration
represent a versatile method that can effectively harvest several
pollutants[37,38]. However, to be efficient, ultrafiltration must be
performed at lower transmembrane pressure, increasing
concerns about cost and maintenance required to maintain
vacuum[39,40].
Lastly, in the field of PFAS degradation, two studies investigated
photocatalysis for the defluorination of PFAS[41,42] at low
temperature, advancing the field by providing a relative simple
and inexpensive degradation of these compounds. However, the
PFAS accumulation that triggers these reactions still remain an
unsolved problem. A method for their initial accumulation is crucial
to use in combination with effective PFAS degradation[43].
Here, we propose to combine the advantages of easy handling of
MOF-gels to capture PFOA with high efficiency using a platform
that allows fast and cost-effective pollutant removal and
accumulation. In our study, we investigate the structural
properties of the MOF-gel before and after filtration of PFOAcontaminated water, the distribution of adsorbed PFOA, and the
efficiency of pollutant removal. The gel's porous structure and
nano crystallinity were confirmed by Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) as well as electron diffraction (ED). The gel was then
immersed into a controlled PFOA solution, and Fluoride Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (19F-NMR) was used to analyze the
supernatant to assess the pollutant harvesting performance.
Solid-state NMR provided further insights into the interaction
between the fluorinated compound and the gel matrix, shedding
lights into the nature of these bindings. Elemental mapping by
Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) in scanning electron
microscopy (STEM) was applied to confirm the ability of the gel to
absorb PFOA, to visualize the spatial distribution of PFOA within
the gel, and to verify the uptake on the nanoscale. Finally, to prove
that the gel could function as a PFOA accumulator, the gel was
used as a filter and the contaminated water was passed through
to test the scalability of the approach proposed here. Our results
prove that MOF-gels, such as UiO-66 gel, can provide an efficient
and scalable platform for PFAS remediation, and pave the way for
new practical solutions for these environmental challenges.
As the initial step, zirconium terephthalate gel (UiO-66 gel) was
synthesized by mixing zirconium oxide chloride octahydrate and
terephthalic acid in dimethylformamide (DMF) with acetic acid as
modulator and left overnight in an oven at 120° C (see SI for
further details). The subsequent washing procedure, with DMF
first and water second to remove the non-react residues, formed
a gel separated from the solvent. PXRD and TEM studies were
performed to investigate the morphology of the gel in a dry state.
PXRD (see Figure S1 in SI) showed a broad peak at around 5
degrees. This peak broadening indicates that the colloidal
particles are very small (in the nanometer range) and therefore
below the detection limits of PXRD but still indicating a discrete
ordering in the material. ED in TEM (Figure 2a) shows distinct
rings confirming the crystalline nature of the UiO-66 gel. The highangle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM image in Figure 2b
reveals a hierarchical porous structure of the gel. The
corresponding STEM-EDS elemental mapping of zirconium
(Figure 2d) and oxygen (Figure 2e) showed a complementary
distribution, as expected for zirconium oxocluster in UiO-66. After

this, the PFOA harvesting capacity of the gel was investigated.
1.6 grams of gel (wet state) were immersed into a 10 ml solution
of 2.37 mM PFOA, mixed, and left overnight. After the gel was
separated by centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed with
19
F NMR spectroscopy. 19F NMR (Figure 3) was employed to
detect PFOA, because fluoride traces are only present in PFOA
due to the lack of C-H groups. The peak ⑦ at -80.75 ppm was

to the different C-F terminal groups are indicated by corresponding #s ①-⑦)
The change in intensity of peak ⑦ at -80.75 ppm was used to calculate the
harvesting efficiency (see details in SI: table in Figure S2).

the CF2 at -126 ppm (see left figure in Figure S3 in SI) suggests
that the PFOA coordinates to the carbonyl end of UiO-66 (i.e. the
zirconium oxo cluster). Ultimately, the observation of the 13C
chemical shift of the carbonyl supports this interpretation.
However, the PFOA concentration in the used gel was too low to
detect a 13C spectrum with sufficient S/N ratio to identify the
carbonyl signal, which is only weakly observed for the reference
PFOA at 168 ppm in the 13C-{19F} CPMAS experiment (see Figure
S3 in SI). TEM analysis (Figure 5) was performed on the dry gel
after contact with PFOA. TEM-ED analysis (Figure 4a) confirmed
that UiO-66 gel retained its crystalline structure and hierarchical
pores after PFOA contact, as shown by unchanged ED patterns
(see Figure S4 in SI). Scanning Electron microscope (SEM)
pictures showed no apparent change in gel morphology before
and after the PFOA contact (see Figure S5 in SI). The STEM-EDS
mapping (Figures 4b-f) showed a spatially homogeneous fluoride
signal throughout the UiO-66 matrix, confirming that the fluorine
compound has interacted with the gel as the molecules are
absorbed in the gel framework. STEM-EDS spot analysis of the
gel after PFOA contact shows a significant F peak, in contrast to
the gel before the contact with PFOA (no F peak, see details in
Figure S6 in SI).
Finally, we form the UiO-66 gel into a membrane to test the
scalability of the here proposed concept for water filtration. To
create the membrane, the gel was dispersed in ethanol and
applied to a filter paper. The filtration efficiency was tested with 3
fractions of 6 ml PFOA-water solution (2.36mM) to evaluate the
suitability of the gel as a membrane for the ultrafiltration of PFOAcontaminated water. Again, 19F NMR and the peak at 80.75 (see
⑦ in Figure 3) was used to estimate the concentration of PFOA
in water, before and after contact with the gel, respectively. The
first, second and third fraction's calculated concentration after gel
contact was 0.10 mM (Frac 1), 0.11 mM (Frac 2), and 0.15 mM
(Frac 3), marking a HE at 95.0 % ±1.3%, 95.0% ±1.5% and 93.5%
±2.5%, respectively (Figure 5). It is worth noting that it took only a
few minutes for each fraction to pass through the gel membrane
and the funnel, and the pollutant separation occurred solely due
to gravity. This indicates a higher performance in the initial
filtration of water, as traditional filtration methods[45] require a

assigned to the CF3 terminal group of the PFOA, while the peak
⑥ at -126.7 ppm was assigned to the CF2 moiety next to the acid,
according to previous literature[44]. The calculated area of the
peak showed a generally reduced peak intensity compared to the
blank (see details in the table in Figure S2 in SI, column: CF3
peak area), strongly indicating that PFOA was removed from the
water when the gel was present. The gel achieved a harvesting
efficiency (HE) of 96.2(±0.2) %, reducing PFOA concentration
from 2.360 mM to 0.089(±0.005) mM in a single cycle (see details
in the table in Figure S2 in SI), demonstrating its promising
potential for water ultrafiltration. Solid-state 19F MAS and 13C-{19F}
CPMAS NMR spectra confirm the presence of PFOA inside the
dried spent gel (see Figure S3 in SI). While the 13C spectrum of
the dried gel is almost identical to the reference PFOA (see right
figure in Figure S3 in SI), the 19F spectrum is less resolved, for
the CF2 moieties (see peaks at -125ppm in left figure in Figure S3
in SI). Although the CF3 peak exhibits a slight shift towards less
negative ppm, the broadening of the CF2 signals and absence of

differential in pressure for the water to pass through a membrane.
Therefore, our proposed method would allow for lower cost and
less maintenance compared to traditional methods, and the
increased HE in the three fractions (Figure 5) showed a potential
for few replacements of the filter system. Thus, our UiO-66 gel
membrane represents a scalable solution for the remediation of
PFAO-contaminated water, offering both efficiency and
applicability in large-scale water treatment.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of zirconium
terephthalate gels as a valuable material for water ultrafiltration,
especially for PFAS removal. The gel morphology addresses
limitations of MOFs in powder form, offering easy handling as well
as better mechanical support and processability. By a detailed
characterization using PXRD and a suite of TEM-based
techniques, such as electron diffraction and STEM imaging, the
gel possessed a nanocrystalline character and hierarchical
porous structure, which is crucial for its functionality in pollutant
removal. Quantitative NMR revealed that the gel achieved an
efficiency of ~96%, while solid-state NMR proved the interaction
of the fluoride groups with the gel matrix. Furthermore, HAADFSTEM imaging as well STEM-EDS elemental mapping revealed
that, while the gel maintained its microstructure, the PFOA is
evenly distributed within the gel after application. After the UiO-66
gel was used (as membrane) for water ultrafiltration it maintained
high harvesting ability with an HE above 95%. This highlights the
potential of MOF gels as scalable platforms for environmental
remediation.
Thanks to their improved handling, high pollutant removal
efficiency and structural stability, MOF gels show great promise
in terms of sustainability in addressing environmental challenges.
