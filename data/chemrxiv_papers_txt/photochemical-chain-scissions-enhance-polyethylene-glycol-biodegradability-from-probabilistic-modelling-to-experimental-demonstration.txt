Abstract
Polyethylene glycols (PEGs), a major class of water-soluble polymers (WSPs), are widely used
in diverse applications which may lead to their release into the environment. This work
investigates the reaction of PEGs with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (‚Ä¢OH), an
important environmental oxidant, and assesses the effect of reaction-induced molecular weight
(MW) decreases on PEG biodegradation dynamics in soil and sediment. Probabilistic kinetic
modelling revealed a significant reduction in PEG MW after only a few ‚Ä¢OH-induced chain
scissions on initial PEG molecules. The simulation results were experimentally validated by
reacting 13C-labeled PEGs (average MW = 6200 Da) with photochemically produced ‚Ä¢OH,
resulting in pronounced shifts in the size distribution of PEGs towards lower MWs with
increasing reaction extents. Incubations of the initial non-reacted and three incrementally ‚Ä¢OHreacted PEG mixtures over a 150-day period in sediment and soil demonstrated increasing rates
and extents of PEG biodegradation to 13CO2 with increasing ‚Ä¢OH-reaction extent and thus
decreasing PEG average MW. This study underscores the importance of considering the MW
distributions of WSPs and their dynamic changes through biotic or abiotic chain scission
reactions ‚Äî showcased herein by reacting PEGs with photochemically produced ‚Ä¢OH ‚Äî in
mechanistically understanding WSP biodegradability in natural and engineered receiving
environments.

Introduction
Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are a major class of synthetic water-soluble polymers
(WSPs) with an annual global production volume of approximately 600 kilotons.1 In home and
personal care products, PEGs act as emulsifiers and moisture carriers.2,3 In these applications,
PEGs are typically diluted in water and are discarded in household wastewater streams. In
agricultural formulations, PEGs emulsify and stabilize pesticides and fertilizers, thereby
ensuring their efficient application.4 A common feature of these applications is that PEGs are
subject to dissipative release, either to wastewater treatment plants or agricultural soils. The
latter may also receive indirect inputs when fertilized with PEG-containing sludge.5
Despite these release pathways into natural and engineered systems, the environmental
chemistry and fate of PEGs ‚Äì as well as of WSPs in general ‚Äì remains poorly studied and
understood.6,7 Besides transport and mobility considerations,8,9 transformation processes, such
as extracellular chain-scission reactions, are of particular relevance. Biodegradation, a process
in which microorganisms take up and metabolically convert PEGs into CO2 and microbial biomass, can be considered the ultimate transformation endpoint. Previous studies have proposed
that this microbial utilization of PEGs occurs through end-group specific (i.e., exolytic) oxidation reactions catalyzed by three intracellular enzymes: an alcohol dehydrogenase, which converts the terminal alcohols into aldehydes; an aldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidizes the aldehydes to carboxylic acids; and, finally, an ether bond-cleaving enzyme (e.g., a-hydroxy acid
dehydrogenase), which acts on the carboxylic end groups releasing glyoxylates, thereby shortening the PEG chain by one unit.10‚Äì14 The glyoxylates are then further metabolized to CO2.
Biodegradability is a highly desired property as it prevents PEG molecules from accumulating
in the environment and, therefore, constrains the exposure component in environmental risk
assessment scenarios, irrespective of potential hazard, which is object of investigation of academic research as well as product safety screening studies.15‚Äì20

Transformation reactions that beak PEG chains, generating lower molecular weight
(MW) molecules, are expected to enhance biodegradability: This is because, first, the number
of hydroxyl end groups per unit molecular mass increases while the MW decreases, thereby
also increasing the probability of exolytic enzymatic breakdown. Second, uptake rates of PEG
molecules across microbial membranes into cells ‚Äì a prerequisite for intracellular metabolic
conversion ‚Äìare expected to increase with decreasing MW.21 While the dependency of PEG
MW on environmental biodegradation has not yet been systematically studied, the published
data support faster biodegradation of PEGs with lower MW. For instance, PEG molecules up
to 14600 Da showed complete degradation within 20 days in activated-sludge inoculated
freshwater media, while PEG molecules with higher MWs required longer incubations for
complete biodegradation (i.e., 60 days for PEGs with a number average molecular weight """"
ùëÄ!
= 57800 Da).22 Similarly, PEG molecules with average MW of 400 Da biodegraded in
agricultural topsoils within 42‚Äì71 days 23, while molecules with average MW of 4000 Da
biodegraded more slowly (extrapolated biodegradation extent of 50% only after estimated 735
days).24
In sunlit aquatic systems, PEGs may react with photochemically produced hydroxyl
radicals (‚Ä¢OH), resulting in chain scissions and thus decreasing MW of the PEGs. The rate of
this reaction increases with increasing steady-state ‚Ä¢OH concentrations ([‚Ä¢OH]ss) in surface
water, which are reported to range from 10-17 M to 10-15 M.25‚Äì30 Major photosensitizers for ‚Ä¢OH
are nitrate, nitrite, and dissolved organic matter (DOM).26,31,32 The reaction of PEG with ‚Ä¢OH
is well-studied for engineered systems as ‚Ä¢OH are generated in commonly used water treatment
processes such as UV/H2O2 treatment and ozonation, which are widely implemented around
the world. These studies have shown that PEG chain scissions occur, thereby lowering the
average MW and increasing polydispersity index (PDI) of PEGs.33,34 By contrast, PEG

reactions with environmental ‚Ä¢OH and its implications, particularly a hypothesized increase in
PEG biodegradability, remain unexplored.
This study systematically assesses the effects of ‚Ä¢OH-reaction induced chain scissions
on the MW distribution and subsequent biodegradability of PEGs in soil and sediment. Chain
scissions of PEGs are hypothesized to enhance biodegradability due to the formed smaller PEG
molecules being more readily assimilated and metabolized by microbes. We chose PEG
reaction with ‚Ä¢OH not only due to its environmental relevance but also as an illustrative
example to assess the importance of WSP chain scission reactions on subsequent WSP
biodegradation in natural and engineered systems. The hypothesis was tested in a three-step
approach: first, we simulated ‚Ä¢OH reaction-induced decreases in the average MW of weightdistributed PEG molecules using numerical simulations (Monte Carlo). Second, we
experimentally reacted 13C-labelled PEGs (average MW = 6200 Da) with ‚Ä¢OH generated by
H2O2 photoirradiation and tracked the resulting changes in MW distributions of the PEG
molecules over time using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to both a charged
aerosol detector and a mass spectrometer (HPLC-CAD-MS). This experimental data was
compared to Monte Carlo model predictions. Third, we incubated the initial and three
incrementally ‚Ä¢OH-reacted PEG molecules in a soil and a sediment and monitored
biodegradation dynamics by following the formation of PEG-derived 13CO2. This study is the
first to link WSP reaction-induced chain scissions to environmental biodegradability and,
building on previous studies on structural polymers,35‚Äì38 pioneers the use of stable carbon
isotope labeling in WSP environmental fate assessment.

PEG molecule forms two daughter PEG molecules, as shown by two arrows. The formed PEGs
were of lower MW and are referred to as 1st generation intermediates because they originated
from chain scissions on the initial PEGs. It is important to note that 1st generation intermediates
can still be formed after higher-generation products, as chain scissions occur stochastically for
each PEG molecule, depending on when they undergo their first reaction event during the
simulation. For the shown simulation, 5 solid arrows from the initially reacting 11 PEG
molecule point to other ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô scission products that subsequently continued to react
with ‚Ä¢OH. The remaining 22 - 5 = 17 dashed arrows point to PEG products in the ‚ÄòFinal Chains‚Äô

For more reliable statistics and to obtain better-resolved MW distributions of the final

PEG chain scissions from reaction with ‚Ä¢OH ‚Äì experimental assessment via UV/H2O2
treatment. A solution of 13C-PEG (Mn = 6200 Da, PDI = 1.08, corresponding to an MW
distribution of 6380 ¬± 400 Da) was reacted with ‚Ä¢OH produced by UV-light photolysis of H2O2
for t1 = 15 min, t2 = 30 min, and t3 = 45 min. Note that 13C-PEGs instead of non-labelled PEGs
were chosen due to subsequent 13CO2 mineralization studies. An exemplary HPLC-CAD
chromatogram of PEG molecules in solution after t1 = 15 min of reaction is shown in Figure
2a. The entire set of chromatograms including the initial PEG solution (t0= 0 min; no
photolysis) and the three reaction times t1, t2, and t3 are provided in section S2 (Supplementary
Information). Individual PEG molecules were well separated over a large MW range from 2000
to 6400 Da. Over this MW range, assignment of the peaks in the chromatogram to specific
PEG molecules of defined MW was based on simultaneous analysis of the column effluent by
HR-MS (Figure 2a). The elugrams for three targeted ions (m/z of 1758, 1873, 1988 (all z= 2),

monomeric units of 46.05 Da)) are shown in Figure 2b. The exact masses were assigned based
on the corresponding HR-MS spectra (Figure 2c). Separation of individual PEG molecules
decreased at higher loadings onto the HPLC column, as was the case for PEGs with MW >
5000 Da and MW < 3000 Da for experimental solutions from t1. As a result, integral
calculations over these MW regions showed higher uncertainties (as further discussed below).
Separation was insufficient for PEGs with MWs below ~2000 Da (filled green peak area below
20 mins of elution in Figure 2a) and above ~6400 Da (filled purple peak starting above 810
mins of elution in Figure 2a).
The initial 13C-PEG molecules in the unreacted solution had a relatively broad MW
distribution starting from approximately 4000 Da, with a maximum in abundance around 6200
Da (t0 line in Figure 2d). Integration of the CAD peaks in the t0-sample chromatogram revealed
""""
that approximately 50 wt% of the PEG molecules were below the ùëÄ
! = 6200 Da given by the
supplier (Polymer Source Inc., Dorval, QC, Canada), indicating a symmetric MW distribution
(Figure 2e). As expected, reaction of the initial PEG molecules with ‚Ä¢OH formed lower MW
PEGs. With increasing reaction time from t1 to t3, the MW distribution of PEG molecules
became more uniform across the MW range from 2000 to 6400 Da (Figure 2d). Further, the
abundance of PEG molecules with MW < 2000 Da (ordinate intercepts in Figure 2e; obtained
by integration of the poorly resolved early peak in the sample chromatogram (Figure 2a))
increased from 0 wt% for t0, to 18, 25, and 49 wt% for t1, t2, and t3, respectively, while the
abundance of the high MW fraction > 6400 Da decreased from ca. 50 wt% for t0 to 30, 25, and
20 wt% for t1, t2, and t3, respectively. The abundance of the latter may have been slightly
overestimated as the MS spectra revealed that also few small PEGs eluted in the high MW
elution time region of the chromatogram (labelled > 6400 Da in Figure 2a). At the same time,
the summed integrals of all peaks in the sample chromatograms, including the poorly resolved
peaks for MW < 2000 Da and > 6400 Da (Figure 2a), yielded similar values for all four tested

PEG chain scissions from reaction with ‚Ä¢OH ‚Äì effect on PEG biodegradability in soil
and sediment. The formation of PEG molecules with lower MW (including the abovementioned oxidized PEG variants) due to ‚Ä¢OH-induced chain scissions is hypothesized to result
in enhanced biodegradability. This hypothesis was tested by incubating aliquots of the
unreacted PEG solution (i.e., t0 = 0 min) and the three reacted PEG solutions (i.e., UV/H2O2
treatmemt times t: t1 = 15 min, t2 = 30 min, and t3 = 45 min of reaction) in triplicate in a reference
soil and sediment. The use of 13C-labelled PEGs enabled the selective quantification of PEG
mineralization to 13CO2 (i.e., 13CMineralized) over the course of the incubations, as well as the total
non-mineralized PEG-added 13C (i.e., 13CNon-Mineralized) that remained in the soil and sediment
at the end of the incubations.
Sediment incubations. Incubation of the unreacted 13C-PEG solution (i.e., t0) in Rotsee
sediment resulted in low initial mineralization rates. These rates increased over time and
peaked at a maximum rate of 0.97 ¬± 0.32 %13C h-1 at around 6 days of incubation (Figure 3a;
15

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-t42q4 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9717-0369 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

rates shown for the first 20 days of incubation). Thereafter, mineralization rates continuously
decreased to low values around 0.002 %13C h-1 at 20 days. Time-integration of the
mineralization rates yielded the cumulative mineralization extent of 13CMineralized = 66 ¬± 3 % of
the initial PEGs at the end of the incubation after 150 days (Figure 3b; t0). Similar to the
incubation of unreacted solutions, incubation of the three reacted PEG solutions showed
maxima in mineralization rates at around 6 days of incubation with values varying between 0.8
and 1 % 13C h-1. However, incubations of the three reacted PEG solutions showed an additional
maximum in mineralization rates at 2 days of incubation with rates increasing from 0.1 % 13C
h-1 for t1 to approximately 0.3 %13C h-1 for t3. These peaks in mineralization rates likely
corresponded to microbial utilization of low MW PEG molecules formed through reaction with
‚Ä¢OH, with cumulative mineralization extents after 3 days of incubation increasing from 4 %
(t1), to 7 % (t2) and 9 % (t3). Furthermore, the final mineralization extents also increased from
13

CMineralized = 71 ¬± 0.5 % for t1, to 76 ¬± 4.1 % for t2, and 79 ¬± 3 % for t3 of the 13C added, all of

which were higher than the 13CMineralized = 66 ¬± 3 % for t0 (Figure 3b). After terminating the
incubations, sediment aliquots were analyzed by EA-IRMS for quantification of 13CNonMineralized. For all four sediment samples, the mass balance on PEG-added

13

C was complete, as

13

CNon-Mineralized and 13CMineralized added up to between 96 ¬± 1 % and 98 ¬± 2 % of the total PEG-

13

C initially added into the incubation flasks (Figure 3e). Closing the mass balance is a unique

feature of using 13C-labelled polymers.
Soil incubations. Incubation of the unreacted PEGs (i.e., t0 solution) resulted in a small
maximum in mineralization rates of ~ 0.035 %13C h-1 after 20 hours, after which mineralization
rates decreased to low and approximately constant values of ~ 0.0005 %13C h-1 over the rest of
the incubation (Figure 3c). The low final 13CMineralized = 1.25 % after 150 days of incubation
(Figure 3d) revealed that the PEG molecules with MWs around 6200 Da did not readily
biodegrade in this soil. Incubation of PEGs from the reacted solutions showed higher initial

normalized mineralisation rates that reached global maxima also after approximately 20 hours
of incubation. The mineralization rates increased with increasing ‚Ä¢OH reaction time to values
of 0.17 %13C h-1 for the most reacted PEGs (i.e., t3 solution). After approximately 4 days of
incubation, the ‚Ä¢OH-reacted PEGs showed a second, smaller maximum in normalized
mineralization rates which increased from 0.012 %13C h-1 for the t1 sample to approximately
0.024 %13C h-1 for the t3 sample. At this point, cumulative mineralization extents reached 4, 6,
and 8 % for the t1, t2, and t3 samples, respectively, while it was below 0.1 % for t0 sample
(Figure 3d). The mineralization rate subsequently decreased for all reacted PEGs to values
between ~ 0.002 %13C h-1 (t1 solution) and 0.007 %13C h-1 (t3 solution). Distinct increases in
the mineralization extents of treated PEGs were observed at around 40 days of incubation
resulted from wetting of the soil to re-adjust its water content (Figure 3d) and are further
discussed below. Final mineralization extents after 150 days of incubation increased with
increasing reaction of PEGs with ‚Ä¢OH from 13CMineralized = 20 ¬± 0.8, to 34 ¬± 3.2, and 45 ¬± 0.3 %
for the t1, t2 and t3 samples, respectively (Figure 3d). Given that 13CO2 was still formed when
incubations were terminated, higher final extents would have been obtained if the soil
incubations had been continued beyond 150 days. Quantification of 13CNon-Mineralized in the soils
closed mass balances on total added 13C for all soil incubations (i.e., mass balances between
97 ¬± 2 % and 104 ¬± 4 % of 13C added; Figure 3f).
Comparison of PEG biodegradation in sediment and soil. In both sediment and soil,
the rates and final extents of PEG mineralization to 13CO2 increased with increasing ‚Ä¢OH
reaction time, confirming the hypothesis that PEG chain scissions under formation of smaller
PEG molecules increase PEG biodegradability ‚Äì and , thereby, that considering PEG reaction
with ‚Ä¢OH is sunlit environments is important when estimating PEG biodegradation half-lives.
The increase in biodegradation of PEG upon reaction with ‚Ä¢OH was less pronounced in the
sediment for which already the unreacted PEGs attained high mineralization extents.

Conversely, since the unreacted PEGs did not biodegrade in soils, the effect of forming
biodegradable PEG molecules with lower MW from ‚Ä¢OH-reaction induced chain scissions was
much more pronounced. This finding suggests a much stronger MW dependence of PEG
biodegradation in soils than sediments ‚Äì and that PEG chain scission reactions may lift
biodegradation restrictions in soils. In fact, the final mineralization extents closely match the
fractions of PEGs with MW < 2000 Da of 21, 35, and 55 wt% for the t1, t2, and t3 samples,
respectively, as determined by HPLC-CAD. This finding suggests an upper limit for PEG
biodegradation in soils under the given conditions is between 2000 and 2500 Da.
The nature of the non-mineralized PEG-added 13C in both sediment and soil incubations
was not identified but may have included both residual PEG molecules with comparatively
high MW as well as PEG-derived 13C incorporated into sediment microbial biomass. The latter
seems plausible for sediment incubations given that even the non-reacted PEGs underwent
extensive mineralization. In this case, the slow and continuous 13CO2 formation in the sediment
during later stages of the incubation would reflect the slow turnover of microbial biomass
containing PEG-derived 13C. While biomass incorporation of PEG-13C may have also occurred
during soil biodegradation, the 13CNon-Mineralized for the soil incubations were too high to have
resulted exclusively from biomass incorporation: maximum carbon use efficiencies of soil
microorganisms of around 0.5 have been reported, implying that at most 50 % of the
metabolized carbon can become biomass-incorporated.41 It therefore is likely that a significant
fraction of 13CNon-Mineralized corresponded too PEG molecules with MWs too high to be
microbially accessible.
The restricted biodegradation of PEGs with high MW in the soil as compared to the
sediment may have two general explanations. First, it is conceivable that microorganisms
capable of metabolizing PEGs were more abundant and/or active in the sediment than the soil.
However, this explanation is disfavored by the finding that PEGs with low MW were readily

18

mineralized in the soil, demonstrating that it contained active microorganisms capable of
enzymatically metabolizing PEGs.
The second and more likely explanation is that the bioavailability of larger PEG
molecules was lower in the soil than the sediment. Limited bioavailability in soils may have
resulted from both spatial separation between the PEG molecules and the cells and, in case of
close contact, slow uptake into the cell of soil microorganisms. The soil incubations were static
(i.e., non-stirred) and conducted under unsaturated conditions (i.e., 50% of the soil WHC) ‚Äì
likely resulting in low rates at which spatial separation between PEGs and cells were overcome.
Adsorption of PEGs to soil particles may have further lowered bioavailability. Conversely,
sediment incubations were fully water-saturated and continuously stirred and therefore likely
resulted in high transfer rates of PEG molecules to cell surfaces (and less adsorption of PEGs
due to competitive displacement from particle surfaces by water). Furthermore, it is possible
that differences in the cell wall architecture and membrane rigidities between soil and sediment
microorganisms resulted in a more stringent MW-cutoff for microbial uptake in soils.42,43
Further work is needed to elucidate uptake mechanisms, including diffusion of sufficiently low
MW PEGs across membranes, potential partial uptake of larger PEG molecules into microbial
cells with one chain end to then undergo intracellular exolytic processing ‚Äì followed by
continuous gradual uptake and processing of the remainder of the PEG chain, and
endocytosis.21,44 Differences in the uptake pathways may control the MW at which PEG
molecules undergo fast intracellular processing.

Environmental Implications
This study underscores the critical role of photochemically produced ‚Ä¢OH in the environmental
fate of PEGs, a key class of WSPs. Chain scissions in PEGs that result from reaction with ‚Ä¢OH
are expected to occur widely in sunlit surface waters (e.g., lakes, rivers, and agricultural
ditches, where PEG inputs may originate from effluents of wastewater treatment plants, and
agricultural runoff) as well as on wet, sunlit surfaces (e.g., plant leaves or soil minerals) that
receive PEGs from agricultural formulations. Chain scissions cause a shift in the MW
distribution of PEGs toward smaller molecules, which are subsequently biodegraded much
more rapidly and extensively in soils and sediments than the higher-MW parent molecules.
This underscores that the environmental stability and (bio)degradation rates of PEGs largely
depend on their specific MW.
Beyond PEGs, this work demonstrates that robust environmental fate assessments of WSPs,
particularly when biodegradation is included as the ultimate transformation endpoint, must
account for polymer chain scission reactions and the resulting changes in the MW distribution
of WSPs. The probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model developed and experimentally
validated in this study provides a versatile tool to predict chain scissions in WSPs and their
impacts on MW distribution. This model can be adapted for WSPs undergoing position-specific

chain scission reactions, such as those driven by abiotic or enzymatic hydrolysis of specific
bonds in the polymer backbone.
Our findings emphasize the importance of a MW-specific approach to evaluating the fate and
stability of WSPs in both natural and engineered systems. Low-MW molecules within a given
WSP class may be readily taken up and metabolized by microorganisms, rendering them
(readily) biodegradable, while high-MW molecules with identical chemistry may be stable due
to limited microbial availability rather than ‚Äòchemical recalcitrance‚Äô to metabolic processing
inside the cell. To advance the current state of knowledge, future work should systematically
investigate MW-dependent WSP biodegradation across terrestrial and aquatic environments
and elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving potential differences. Ultimately, accurate
characterization of MW distributions is essential for advancing biodegradability assessments
and testing protocols for WSPs.

Kinetic Calculation of PEG reaction with ‚Ä¢OH. Reaction of PEGs with hydroxyl
radical (‚Ä¢OH) was modelled assuming pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (Equation 1) at
three steady-state ‚Ä¢OH concentrations (i.e., [‚Ä¢ OH]SS = 10-15 M, 10-16 M, and 10-17 M) that cover
the concentration range reported for sunlit surface waters.26,28

The reactions following ‚Ä¢OH attack (i.e., addition of dioxygen and intermolecular
rearrangements leading to a chain scission) have reported rate constants that are higher than
k1.33 The overall scission reaction rate, therefore, is close to being diffusion limited (since kdiff
is usually around 10-9-10-10 M-1 s-1 according to the Smoluchowsky equation). The average

where kP (M-1 s-1) is the rate constant for PEG reacting with ‚Ä¢OH. The proportionality constant
of 0.8 was selected for PEGs as it was previously reported for the reaction between
benzophenone radicals and n-alkanes of various lengths.47

Around n > 30 approaching diffusion-limitation of the reaction results from the
increased number of reaction sites per PEG molecule, which increases the effective rate
constant kP. At the same time, the larger PEG molecules undergo coiling in solution. Such
coiling lowers the rate constant of the reaction between ‚Ä¢OH and a monomeric unit of the PEG
chain, kM, because the reaction is preferably occurring on the surface of the PEG coil. This
effect can be accounted for by incorporating the effective reaction radius of the PEG molecule
into the reaction rate constant using the Smoluchowski equation for diffusion-limited reactions
in dilute solutions (Equation 5):46

where ùëÖ‚àô9: and ùëÖ8;< (dm) are the hydrodynamic radii of ‚Ä¢OH and the coiled PEG molecule,
respectively, T [K] is the temperature, ùúÇ (kg dm-1 s-1) is the dynamic viscosity of water, ùëÅ=
(mol-1) is the Avogadro constant, and ùê∑‚àô9: and ùê∑8;< (dm2 s-1) are the effective diffusion
coefficients of the ‚Ä¢OH and the PEG molecule, respectively. Since ùëÖ‚àô9: << ùëÖ8;< and ùê∑‚àô9: >>
ùê∑8;< , equation 5 simplifies to Equation 6:

Probabilistic simulation of the chain cleavage. The Monte Carlo simulation started by
defining the initial chain length distribution of the PEG molecules. The chain lengths, ni for i
= 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, m (where m = number of chains with ni monomeric units), were assumed to follow
a normal distribution with a mean chain length ùúÜ (representing the average degree of
polymerization "ùëã""!"), and a standard deviation s.
Chain-scissions in the simulation was restricted to chains with more than one monomeric unit
(ni > 1). For each selected chain with length nj , a reaction and thus cutting point cj (where cj ‚àà
(nj -1) cutting positions) was randomly identified in the simulation. The probability of cj to be
chosen was uniformly distributed between 1 and nj -1, ensuring that the scission produces two
new viable segments (i.e., reaction products). The lengths of these reaction products were nc
and nj-nc. The probability of chain j with length nj to be chosen for scission, P(nj), is
proportional to the continuous rate constant ùëòD for reaction of PEG and ‚àô OH and thus depends
on the number of repeating monomeric units n as rationalized above, and thus defined as
(Equation 7):

After each scission, the collection of chains in the simulation is updated by removing the chain
with length nj that reacted and adding the two formed segments with lengths nc and nj-nc. The
MW of each chain is calculated by multiplying the number of monomeric units per chain n
with the MW of the monomeric unit (MWmonomer, 12C-PEG = 44 Da, MWmonomer, 13C-PEG = 46 Da).

Photodegradation experiments. Solutions of 13C-PEG (Polymer Source Inc., Mn =
6200 Da, Mw/Mn = 1.08; dissolved in MilliQ water to a concentration of 5 mg 13C-PEG ml-1 in
stock solution) were irradiated in glass tubes in a LZC photoreactor (LZC-4V) equipped

with twelve 365 nm UVA broad band bulbs. For each reaction timepoint (t0= 0 min
(unreacted solution), t1 = 15 min, t2 = 30 min, and t3 = 45 min), triplicate solutions were
prepared by mixing 6 mL of the above 13C-PEG solution and 2 ml of a 100 mM H2O2-solution
(prepared in Milli-Q water) in tubes that were placed on a carousel inside the photoreactor.
After the respective reaction time, the triplicate tubes were removed from the reactor and the
solution in each tube was split into three subsamples: 100 ¬µL were taken for high pressure
liquid chromatography with charged aerosol detection and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HPLC-CAD-HR-MS) analysis, 900 ¬µL were taken for 13C-NMR analysis, and 7 mL for the
biodegradability testing. Details on the analytical methods are provided in section S2
(Supplementary Information). At concentrations below 1 mg PEG mL-1, the response of the
CAD is independent of PEG MW,48 allowing for quantification of all molecules of a given n.
We additionally ran control samples of PEGs (+ H2O2) in the dark. These dark controls
confirmed that PEGs did not degrade in the absence of light, confirming that the PEG
breakdown into lower MW components was caused by ‚Ä¢OH photochemically produced from
irradiation of the H2O2 solution.
Sediment and soil incubations. Preparations. Prior to transferring the 13C-PEG
solutions (t0 to t3) into the incubation bottles, residual H2O2 from the solutions was removed
by adding 0.05 mL of catalase from bovine liver (Sigma Aldrich, aqueous suspension, 1 ‚àô 104
to 4 ‚àô 104 units mg-1 protein, 0.44 mg protein mL-1) to the 7 mL PEG solution, followed by
gentle stirring for 10 minutes. The same amount of catalase in 7 mL of H2O2 solution without
13

C-PEG, was added to the background incubations, to account for any effects on the

background mineralization.

The sediment was preincubated for 7 days. Afterwards, each of the reacted PEG
solution timepoints was divided in three parts and pipetted into the triplicate sediment
incubations with sediment from a sediment core collected in Lake Rotsee in Lucerne,
Switzerland (sampling date: 27th September, 2023). The top 5 cm of the sediment core was was
mixed with an equal volume of lake water under stirring for 1 h. A volume of 40 mL of the
suspension (with approx. 3 g of dry weight of sediment) was transferred into 100 mL Schott
bottles used for the incubations (total number of 12). Each bottle was placed in an incubation
chamber at 20 ¬∞C and continuously stirred over the course of the incubation.
A soil of the Landwirtschaftliche Untersuchungs- und Forschungsanstalt Speyer
(LUFA, Germany, 6S soil collected in October 2023; 2 mm sieved) was used for the soil
incubations. The soil moisture was adjusted with Milli-Q water to 50% of the maximum water
holding capacity (41.4 wt%). Details on soil properties are provided in section S3
(Supplementary Information). The incubation bottles contained 20 g of dry soil + added water,
and were run in triplicates.
After preparation of the sediment and the soil, 7 ml of the respective PEG solution (t0
to t3) were added dropwise to the incubation bottle. The samples were subsequently incubated
for 150 days at 20 ¬∞C. The water mass was determined gravimetrically and adjusted biweekly
(after the first 4 weeks of incubation).
Quantification of PEG-derived 13CO2 formed in incubations. The mineralization of 13Clabelled PEGs to 13CO2 was followed in triplicate incubation bottles. The bottles were placed
in an incubation system with automated gas phase 13CO2 analysis, as previously described.36
Modifications of the incubation setup (e.g., using pressurized air in the inlet) used in this study
are described in section S4 (Supplementary Information).
Closing mass balances on added PEG carbon-13. After terminating the sediment and
soil incubations, we determined the non-mineralized residual PEG-added carbon-13, 13CNon-

Mineralized, in each incubation bottle. While

13

CNon-Mineralized can be present either as biomass

formed during metabolic utilization of the PEG or residual polymeric PEG (either in the form
of the original PEG or partially biodegraded molecules), these two pools were quantified only
in their total sum. To this end, the sediment or soil from each incubation flask was first freezedried and subsequently milled (frequency of 30 Hz for 1 min in a MM400 oscillatory ball mill
from Retsch GmbH & Co). An aliquot of 10 mg was then subsampled from each milled
sediment and soil for elemental analysis (EA) coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(IRMS) to quantify 13CNon-Mineralized, as described previously.36 Details on the analyses are
provided in section S5 (Supplementary Information).
