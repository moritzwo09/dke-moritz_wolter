Abstract.
Understanding the viscosity and phase state of biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA) from
wildfires and pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) events in the stratosphere is critical for predicting
their role in stratospheric multiphase chemistry and ozone depletion. However, the viscosity and
phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions, including interactions with sulfuric acid
(H₂SO₄), remain largely unquantified. In this study, we combine laboratory data with a
thermodynamic model to predict the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric
conditions. Our results suggest that BBOA with a H₂SO₄-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.37—an
estimated upper limit for pyroCb smoke in the lower stratosphere after two months of aging— is
highly viscous and frequently exists in a glassy state. Even at a higher H₂SO₄-to-BBOA mass
ratio of 0.79 – an estimated upper limit after nine months of aging – BBOA can still transition to
a glassy state under certain stratospheric conditions. In the glassy state, bulk reactions are
suppressed, and multiphase chemistry may be limited to the particle surfaces. We also highlight
key areas for future research needed to better constrain the viscosity and phase state of BBOA in
the stratosphere and its subsequent impact on ozone.
Keywords: Aerosols, biomass burning, viscosity, phase state, glass state, polar stratospheric
clouds, ozone layer, oxidation, atmospheric aging
Synopsis statement: Biomass-burning organic aerosol from wildfires can exist in a glassy state
in the stratosphere, which can affect multiphase chemistry, polar stratospheric cloud formation,
and ozone depletion predictions.

Figure 1. A) Aging of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) in the stratosphere. VOCs
represent volatile organic compounds. B) Possible formation pathways of polar stratospheric
clouds (PSCs). NAT represents nitric acid trihydrate. PSCs form at temperatures less than ≅ 200
K.
Large wildfires periodically inject massive amounts of smoke into the stratosphere (∼15 km ≤
altitude ≤ 50 km) via pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) events and associated deep convection.
Examples include the large-scale wildfires in the Pacific Northwest of North America in 2017
and the Australian “black summer” fires in 2019 — 2020.1,2 Smoke is also ubiquitous in the
upper troposphere and is mixed into the lowermost stratosphere.3,4
Smoke from wildfires consists of mostly organic aerosol, called biomass-burning organic aerosol
(BBOA).5 For example, smoke sampled from wildfires in the western U.S.A. comprised of >
90% BBOA by mass.6,7 Wildfires also emit large amounts of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs). In the atmosphere, hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozone (O3) oxidize VOCs, and some of
the products of these reactions condense onto existing particles, adding to the BBOA mass.8 OH
and O3 can also react directly with BBOA, forming a more oxidized aerosol. These combined
processes result in aged BBOA (Fig. 1A).
In the stratosphere, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can also condense on to the aged BBOA to form aged
BBOA-H2SO4 particles (Fig. 1A). The sources of H2SO4 in the stratosphere includes the
oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from pyroCb events and volcanic eruptions and the oxidation
of carbonyl sulfide (COS) from natural and industrial sources.3,9–11 The conversion of SO2 to
H2SO4 occurs on the order of several weeks in the stratosphere,12 while the conversion of COS to
H2SO4 occurs on the order of tens of years.11
BBOA can linger for many months in the stratosphere and contribute to the depletion of the UVblocking stratospheric ozone layer.13–15 Key reactions that may occur on BBOA in the
stratosphere and contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion include ClONO2+HCl,
ClONO2+H2O, and HOCl+HCl.16 These reactions on BBOA could delay ozone layer recovery
for years to come, increasing ultraviolet radiation exposure at the Earth’s surface and raising the
risk of skin cancer.14,15 Additionally, BBOA introduced into the stratosphere by pyroCb events
may influence the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), potentially causing further
depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.17
Two Important properties of BBOA are the viscosity and phase state (i.e., liquid, semisolid, or
amorphous solid). These properties are closely related: liquids have a viscosity < 102 Pa s,
semisolids range from 102 — 1012 Pa s, and amorphous (“glassy”) solids exhibit a viscosity >
1012 Pa s.18
Knowledge of the viscosity and phase state of BBOA particles is needed to predict the rates of
multiphase reactions, including the multiphase reactions mentioned above that can contribute to
ozone depletion.19–22 For example, the rate for a multiphase reaction often depends on the square
root of the diffusion coefficient within the aerosol particle.16 Since diffusion is related to
1/viscosity, this implies that the rate often depends on the square root of 1/viscosity.

Consequently, high viscosities and the glassy state could inhibit multiphase reactions within the
particle bulk, restricting multiphase chemistry to the particle surface.
Knowledge of the viscosity and phase state of BBOA is also needed to predict the formation
pathways of PSCs (Fig. 1B). If BBOA particles are in a non-glassy state, they can take up H2O
and HNO3 at low temperatures to form non-glassy PSCs (pathway a). In addition, Ansmann et al.
speculated that BBOA particles in a glassy state could heterogeneously nucleate crystalline ice or
crystalline nitric acid hydrate (NAT) (pathways c and d).17 We also speculate that glassy BBOA
may take up H2O and HNO3 to form non-glassy PSCs due to the plasticizing effect of small
molecules like H2O and HNO3 (pathway b).
Researchers previously measured or estimated the viscosity and phase state of BBOA as a
function of temperature and relative humidity (RH).19,20,23,24 They used these results to predict
the behavior of BBOA in the troposphere (altitude ≲ 15 km). However, the temperature and RH
in the stratosphere differ substantially from those in the troposphere, and these differences can
strongly impact viscosity and phase state (as discussed below). Additionally, no studies have
quantified the effect of H2SO4 uptake, or the uptake of any inorganic species, on BBOA viscosity
and phase state. In a recent modelling study of stratospheric chemistry, researchers assumed that
BBOA-H2SO4 particles in the stratosphere exist in a non-glassy state, allowing reactions to occur
in the bulk of the particles.14,15 However, this assumption has not been verified with experiments
or calculations. As a result, the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions
remain highly uncertain.
Several previous studies have quantified the viscosity and phase state of secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) in the troposphere. These studies show that SOA, when free of inorganic species,
can exist in a glassy state in the upper troposphere.25–27 However, these studies did not consider
the temperatures and RH in the stratosphere, and most did not consider the uptake of inorganic
species, such as H2SO4.28
In the following, we use laboratory data and a thermodynamic model to predict the viscosity and
phase state of BBOA in the stratosphere from pyroCb events. We focus on altitudes from 15 —
32 km in the stratosphere, since wildfire plumes from pyroCb events have been observed at these
altitudes. 29–31 We first estimate the viscosity and phase state for unaged BBOA at these heights.
Next, we estimate the viscosity and phase state of aged BBOA particles mixed with H2SO4 (aged
BBOA-H2SO4 particles) at these heights. The implications of the results for stratospheric
chemistry and PSCs are discussed, as well as observational constraints of the viscosity and phase
state of BBOA in the stratosphere. We also provide an outlook for future research on the
viscosity and phase state of BBOA in the stratosphere.
2. Methods.

The viscosity of organic aerosols depends strongly on temperature. Simulated zonal mean

72 vertical levels from surface to about 140 km above surface level and a
horizontal resolution of 1.9° latitude by 2.5° longitude.
29–31

For the altitude range of 15 — 32 km, the stratospheric temperatures vary from 177 — 250
K (see Fig. S1). As a result, we will focus on this temperature range throughout the remainder of
this article.
2.2 RH in the stratosphere relevant for BBOA from pyroCb events.
The viscosity of organic aerosols depends strongly on the RH. The RH in the stratosphere was
calculated using the following equation:
(1)
where Pw is the atmospheric water vapour pressure and P*w is the equilibrium (saturation) water
vapour pressure over liquid water. Pw was calculated using the following equation:
(2)
where z represents altitude and
represents the mixing ratio of water vapor in air. Ptotal(z)
represents the total atmospheric pressure at z and was calculated using a scale height (H) of 7.4
km and the barometric law:
(3)
P*w was calculated using the following equation from Murphy and Koop:34

(4)
where T represents temperature.
Typical CH2O values in the stratosphere are approximately 5 ppmv. However, elevated levels
have been observed in wildfire plumes transported to the stratosphere through pryoCb events.
Kablick et al. reported CH2O values exceeding 15 ppmv in plumes from the Australian wildfires
during 2019 —2020,29 and Yu et al. observed CH2O values exceeding 5 ppmv in plumes from
Canadian wildfires in 2017.35 To align with these observations, we focus on CH2O values of 15
ppmv in our analysis.

The glass transition temperature of dry BBOA (Tg,BBOA) and the volume-based hygroscopicity
parameter of the BBOA (κ) have been reported for several types of unaged BBOA (Table 1).
The variability in Tg,BBOA and κ is likely due to differences in experimental conditions used to
generate and sample the BBOA, such as the fuel type, combustion conditions, and dilution. Here
we calculated the viscosity of unaged BBOA using each of the Tg,BBOA and κ pairs shown in
Table 1 to determine the possible range of viscosities and phase states of unaged BBOA in the
stratosphere.
The viscosity was calculated from Tg,BBOA and κ using the same approach used by Li et al. to
calculate viscosity of SOA in the troposphere.37 First, we calculated the water content of the
BBOA at a given RH using κ and the following equations:26

2.4 Viscosity of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles
To calculate the viscosity of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles at a given RH and temperature, we
first determined the viscosity of aged BBOA particles and H2SO4 particles separately at the given
RH and temperature, as outlined below.
To determine the viscosity of aged BBOA particles at a given RH and temperature, we followed
the same method described in Section 2.3. The viscosities determined in Section 2.3 correspond
to unaged BBOA. We assume that these viscosities represent lower limits for aged BBOA due to
the following factors: a) aging through OH and O3 reactions has been shown to increase BBOA

viscosity at room temperature and on the timescale of days,23,44 b) UV exposure at room
temperature also increases BBOA viscosity on the timescale of days,45 and c) dilution also
increases BBOA viscosity.46 Nevertheless, additional measurements are needed to confirm this
assumption for stratospheric temperatures, relative humidities, and residence times. We hope our
work will motivate further studies on this topic. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that
unaged BBOA in the stratosphere will often be in a glassy state (see below), and hence aging
reactions with OH and O3 should be limited for initial conditions in the stratosphere.
To determine the viscosity of H2SO4 particles at a given RH and temperature, we used the
AIOMFAC-VISC thermodynamic model.47,48 This model applies a semi-empirical approach
based on the Eyring’s absolute rate theory to describe the viscosity of aqueous electrolyte
solutions. The model reproduces viscosity data often within 10% for a wide range of aqueous
electrolyte systems.48
After determining the viscosity of the aged BBOA particles and H2SO4 particles separately at a
given RH and temperature, we used the Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) approach to
calculate the viscosity of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles at the given RH and temperature.48 The
ZSR approach is expressed mathematically as the following:
,

Where , , and
H2SO4 particles, respectively, all at the same RH and temperature.
is the unit viscosity (1 Pa
s); and f1 and f2 are the mass fractions of the two subsystems at the given RH and temperature.
Studies by Song et al.49 and Klein et al.28 show that the ZSR approach predicts viscosities within
1 — 2 orders of magnitude for mixtures of organic and inorganic material.
To predict the viscosity of the aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles using Equation 10, the H2SO4-toBBOA (H2SO4:BBOA) mass ratio is needed. An upper limit to the H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio for
pyroCb smoke in the stratosphere can be estimated based on limited measurements. In 2017, the
NASA Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission sampled pryoCb smoke in the northern
hemisphere and lowest part of the stratosphere from the large-scale wildfires in the Pacific
Northwest of North America.50,51 Single particle measurements from this mission indicate that
the average H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio was ~0.37 and ~0.79 for 2 months and 9 months,
respectively, after the initial pryoCb injection into the stratosphere (Section S1 and Fig. S2).50–52
The H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio was even smaller for the largest particles (≳ 0.5 µm) (Fig. S2).
Based on the size distributions of the typical smoke in the stratosphere and smoke from pryoCb
events, the largest particles were likely mostly from pyroCb events, whereas the smaller particles
were likely aged smoke that is widespread in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.4,51
Based on these limited measurements, we suggest that H2SO4:BBOA mass ratios of 0.37 and
0.79 are likely an upper limit for pyroCb smoke in the lower stratosphere with an aging time of 2
months and 9 months, respectively. To be consistent with the ATom measurements, in the
following, we consider H2SO4:BBOA mass ratios of 0.37, 0.5, and 0.79.

3.1 RH in the stratosphere
Before discussing the viscosity of BBOA in the stratosphere, we first considered the RH in the
stratosphere since the RH strongly impacts particle viscosity. As the RH decreases, the water
activity (and hence water content) of BBOA particles decreases to maintain equilibrium with the
gas phase and the viscosity increases due to the plasticizing effect of water.18,53
We calculated the RH as a function of temperature in the stratosphere at altitudes of 15 and 32
km and a water vapor mixing ratio of 15 ppmv. An altitude range of 15 — 32 km corresponds to
the range of altitudes where wildfire plumes have been observed in the stratosphere.29–31 A water
vapor mixing ratio of 15 ppmv is consistent with the water vapour mixing ratio expected in
wildfire plumes that have reached the stratosphere via pryoCb events.29 35

The results of the calculations are shown in Figure 2. The horizontal bar illustrates the
temperature range of 177 — 250 K, which is most relevant for the BBOA in the stratosphere
from pyroCb events at altitudes of 15 — 32 km (see Methods). Our calculations indicate that the

RH reaches extremely low levels (≲ 1% RH) under a wide range of conditions relevant to
BBOA in the stratosphere. In contrast, in the troposphere, the RH is almost always greater than
10%.54 The low RH levels relevant for BBOA in the stratosphere, combined with the cold
stratospheric temperatures, have significant implications for the viscosity of BBOA in this region
as discussed below.

Shown in Figure 3A are the calculated viscosities for the 10 unaged BBOA types listed in Table
1. Similar to Figure 2, we carried out calculations for the stratosphere at altitudes of 15 and 32
km and a water vapour mixing ratio of 15 ppmv. For the temperature range of 200 — 250 K, all
the BBOA types have viscosities of approximately 107 Pa s or greater (Fig. 3A). These extremely
high viscosities are due to a combination of low RH values and low temperatures (Fig 2).
Furthermore, 8 out of the 10 BBOA types exhibit viscosities exceeding 1012 Pa s for the entire
temperature range of 200 —250 K, indicating that they are predicted to remain in a glassy solid
state throughout this range. For the 2 proxies studied by Gregson et al. a glassy solid state was
observed over a narrower range of temperatures (200 — 230 K for the hydrophobic phase and
200 — 240 K for hydrophilic phase), but the glassy state still dominated between 200 — 250 K.
Overall, these results suggest that the glass state dominates for unaged BBOA in the stratosphere
for the 200 — 250 K temperature range. At temperatures ≲ 200 K all of the BBOA types switch
from a glassy solid state to a semisolid or liquid state (Fig. 3A) due to the heightened RH in this
low-temperature regime (Figure 2). At an altitude of 15 km, the transition from a glassy state to a
semisolid/liquid state occurs at about 195 — 200 K. At an altitude of 32 km, the transition
occurs at about 180 — 185 K.
3.3 Viscosity of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles
Figure 3 also includes calculated viscosities for aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles with with
H2SO4:BBOA mass ratios of 0.37, 0.5, and 0.79. Measurements from the ATom mission suggest
that H2SO4:BBOA mass ratios of 0.37 and 0.79 are likely upper limit for pyroCb smoke in the
lower stratosphere with aging times of 2 months and 9 months, respectively (see Methods).
The H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio of 0.5 is provided as an intermediate value between the ratios of
0.37 and 0.79.
To calculate the viscosities of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles, we used the viscosities of unaged
BBOA as proxies for aged BBOA. Consequently, the calculated viscosities should be considered
as lower limits to the viscosities of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles for several reasons that are
outlined in the Methods section.
For H2SO4:BBOA = 0.37 (Fig. 3B) at temperatures between 200 — 250 K, the viscosity of the
aged BBOA- H2SO4 particles is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower, or more, compared
to the unaged case (compare Fig. 3A and 3B). This decrease is attributed to the low viscosity of
the H2SO4 and its associated water compared to BBOA at the same RH and temperature. Despite
the reduction in viscosity, for the temperature range of 200 — 250 K, all the BBOA types have
viscosities of approximately 104 Pa s or greater. In addition, 6 out of the 10 systems still
exhibited viscosities greater than 1012 Pa s for the full temperature range of 200 — 250 K. For
the remaining 4 systems, the particles still reached 1012 Pa s, although over a narrower
temperature range. Overall, these results suggest that aged BBOA with a H2SO4:BBOA mass
ratio of 0.37 will have a viscosity of approximately 104 Pa or greater and will often be in a glassy
state for the temperature range of 200 — 250K.
For H2SO4:BBOA = 0.37 (Fig. 3B) at temperatures ≲ 200 K, all of the aged BBOA-H2SO4 types
transition from a glassy solid state to a semisolid or liquid state due to the increased RH in this

low-temperature regime. At an altitude of 15 km, the transition from a glassy state to a
semisolid/liquid state occurs at about 195 — 200 K, while at an altitude of 32 km, the transition
occurs at about 180 — 185 K.
For H2SO4:BBOA = 0.79 (Fig.3D) at temperatures between 200 and 250 K, the viscosity
decreases by 1 order of magnitude, or more, compared to H2SO4:BBOA = 0.37. Again, this
reduction is attributed to the low viscosity of the H2SO4 and its associated RH compared to
BBOA at the same RH and temperature. For the temperature range of 200 — 250 K, all the
BBOA types have viscosities of approximately 103 Pa s or greater. In addition, 3 out of the 10
systems exhibited viscosities greater than 1012 Pa s for the full temperature range of 200 — 250
K. For the remaining 7 systems, the particles still reach 1012 Pa s, although over a more narrow
temperature range. Overall, these results suggest that aged BBOA with a H2SO4:BBOA mass
ratio 0.79 will have viscosities of approximately 103 Pa s or greater for the temperature range of
200 to 250 K. In addition, the glass state will form in these aged BBOA for some stratospheric
conditions.
3.4 Sensitivity analysis
In the analysis above, we used a CH2O value of 15 ppmv, consistent with measurements in
plumes that recently entered the stratosphere via pyroCb events. Over time, CH2O levels decrease
due to dilution, eventually reaching background values of ~5 ppmv. To evaluate how a reduction
in CH2O affects viscosity and phase state, we recalculated viscosities using a CH2O value of 5
ppmv (Figure S4). The lower CH2O level increases viscosity. For example, for the hydrophobic
phase studied by Gregson et al., H2SO4:BBOA =0.79, CH2O = 15 ppmv, and an altitude of 15 km,
the highest observed viscosity was ∼1012 Pa s. In contrast, under the same conditions but with
CH2O = 5 ppmv, the highest observed viscosity was ∼1022 Pa s.
To calculate the viscosities of aged BBOA-H₂SO₄ particles, we used the ZSR method. Previous
studies have demonstrated that the ZSR method can estimate the viscosity of mixed organic and
inorganic particles within 1 — 2 orders of magnitude.28,49 Figure S5 presents the predicted
viscosities of aged BBOA-H₂SO₄ particles (CH2O = 15 ppmv and H₂SO₄:BBOA ratio = 0.37, 0.5,
and 0.79) with all of the predicted viscosities reduced by two orders of magnitude. Even after
this reduction, the aged BBOA with a H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio of 0.37 are still predicted to be in
a glassy state often for the 200 — 250 K temperature range. In addition, the aged BBOA with a
H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio of 0.79 will still form the glass state for some stratospheric conditions
and BBOA types.
To calculate the viscosity of BBOA particles from their glass transition temperatures, we
assumed a fragility parameter (D) of 10, consistent with values used in previous studies. For
individual organic molecules, D values typically range from 5 to 20. To assess the impact of this
range, we recalculated viscosities using D values of 5 and 20, with a water vapour mixing ratios
of 15 ppmv and H₂SO₄:BBOA mass ratios of 0, 0.37, 0.5, and 0.79 (Figure S6 and S7). The
largest reductions in viscosity were observed for a D value of 20. Nevertheless, even for D = 20,
the aged BBOA with a H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio of 0.37 are still predicted to be in a glassy state
often for the 200 — 250 K temperature range. In addition, the aged BBOA with a H2SO4:BBOA

mass ratio of 0.79 are still predicted to form the glass state for some stratospheric conditions and
BBOA types.
4. Atmospheric Implications
Recent studies have suggested that reactions occur on or in BBOA in the stratosphere, leading to
unexpected depletion of the UV-blocking stratospheric ozone layer.13–15 In modelling studies,
researchers have assumed that the BBOA-H2SO4 particles in the stratosphere are in a non-glassy
state and that reactions occur in the bulk of the BBOA-H2SO4 particles.14,15 These assumptions
have generally aligned with model-measurement comparisons. Our results suggest that wildfire
smoke particles will have viscosities ≳ 103 Pa s, when the H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio is ≲ 0.79
and the temperature is 200 — 250 K. These high viscosities can influence the characteristic
reaction diffusive length scale and reactive uptake rates. For instance, reactive uptake rates often
scale with the square root of 1/viscosity, meaning a two-order-of-magnitude increase in viscosity
can reduce the reactive uptake rate by one order of magnitude.16 Consequently, these elevated
viscosities may need to be considered to accurately describe the stratospheric chemistry of
wildfire smoke particles.
Our results also suggest that wildfire smoke particles can be in a glassy state (viscosity ≥1012 Pa
s) under certain temperatures and RHs in the stratosphere when the H2SO4:BBOA mass ratio is
≲ 0.79. In such a state, bulk reactions will be inhibited, and multiphase chemistry may be
restricted to the surface of the particles. Therefore, surface reactions may need to be considered
for some conditions in the stratosphere.
As mentioned above, BBOA may influence the formation mechanisms of PSCs via several
pathways (Fig. 1B). In the current study, we address the possibility of pathway c in Figure 1B. In
Figure 3, we show the RH and temperature conditions where vapor becomes supersaturated with
respect to ice, indicated by vertical black lines. The solid black line corresponds to conditions at
an altitude of 15 km, while the dashed black line corresponds to an altitude of 32 km. If viscosity
is ≥ 1012 Pa s to the left of the vertical black lines (i.e., colder temperatures) at the respective
altitudes, BBOA can exist in a glassy state while the vapor is supersaturated with respect to ice.
This glassy state may provide a surface for heterogeneous ice nucleation, leading to the
formation of ice-containing PSCs (pathway c, Fig. 1B).
For H2SO4:BBOA ratios of 0, 0.37, 0.5, and 0.79 at altitudes of 15 km and 32 km (Fig. 3), the
viscosity is ≥ 1012 Pa s to the left of the corresponding vertical black lines. This indicates that
under certain stratospheric conditions, the particles are in a glassy state, the vapor is
supersaturated with respect to ice, and the particles can act as potential surfaces for
heterogeneous ice nucleation, possibly leading to the formation of ice-containing PSCs (pathway
c, Fig. 1B).
Lidar observations indicate that fresh smoke particles in the stratosphere exhibit a high
depolarization ratio, suggesting the presence of non-spherical particles.1,55–57 This elevated
depolarization could signal that BBOA is in a glassy or highly viscous state in the stratosphere.
In newly emitted smoke plumes, BBOA particles can coagulate into fractal aggregates.58 If

BBOA is in a glassy or highly viscous state, the material will not flow, maintaining its fractal
structure after coagulation, which would contribute to a high depolarization ratio.59–61
Additionally, black carbon particles from combustion sources initially have a fractal geometry.
When coated with a low-viscosity material, the fractal geometry can become more compact and
spherical, with a low depolarization ratio.62 However, if black carbon is coated with BBOA in a
glassy or highly viscous state, black carbon can maintain its fractal geometry, and the
depolarization ratio can stay high.62 Nevertheless, interpretation of lidar depolarization is
complicated because depolarization depends on particle size as well as the degree of nonsphericity.59

Lidar data also show that the depolarization ratio of smoke in the stratosphere decreases over a
period of 3 — 4 months, eventually approaching near-zero values (< 0.05).1,63 This trend may
indicate that BBOA transition from a highly viscous state to a less viscous one. A decrease in
viscosity would allow fractal aggregates of BBOA to transform into spherical particles, which
typically exhibit a near-zero depolarization ratio. Similarly, a reduction in BBOA viscosity
would enable fractal black carbon aggregates coated with BBOA to compact into a core-shell
structure, also associated with a low depolarization ratio. However, it is important to note that
glassy or highly viscous BBOA, such as tar balls, that have not coagulated into fractal aggregates
in the atmosphere will possess a spherical geometry and exhibit a low depolarization ratio.64,65
Therefore, a low depolarization ratio does not definitively indicate that BBOA particles are in a
non-glassy and non-viscous state.

Baars et al. pointed out that the decrease in depolarization ratio of smoke in the stratosphere with
time is consistent with the aging of smoke particles and the addition of a coating around the solid
black carbon core aggregates, which would change the shape towards a spherical form.1 We add
here that the coating would also need to be in a non-glassy and lower viscosity state,62 which
may be accomplished by the uptake of H2SO4 present in the stratosphere, as shown above.

5. Outlook
1) When calculating the viscosity of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles, we assumed the viscosity of
unaged BBOA is a lower limit to the viscosity of aged BBOA for several reasons (see
Methods). Nevertheless, additional measurements are needed to confirm this assumption for
stratospheric temperatures, relative humidities, and residence times.
2) We assumed that BBOA forms a single phase when mixed with H2SO4. Previous studies
have shown that when secondary organic aerosol with an average O/C ratio ≳ 0.8 is mixed
with ammonium sulfate aerosols, the resulting particles form a single phase.66–68 Studies are
needed to confirm if a similar threshold applies for BBOA mixed with H2SO4.
3) To calculate the viscosity of BBOA particles from their glass transition temperatures, we
assumed a fragility parameter (D) of 10, consistent with values used in previous studies.
Measurements are needed to confirm that a fragility of 10 is appropriate for BBOA.
4) To calculate the viscosity of aged BBOA-H2SO4 particles, we used the ZSR method and the
AIOMFAC-VISC thermodynamic model. Observations are needed to confirm the validity of
this approach specifically for laboratory-generated and field-collected BBOA-H2SO4
particles.

5) More measurements of the H2SO4 content in wildfire aerosols as a function of age in the
stratosphere are needed. These measurements could be carried out by high-altitude aircraft or
by using infrared spectra of wildfire smoke in the stratosphere from satellite measurements.13
6) Additional observational constraints on the viscosity and phase state of BBOA in the
stratosphere are needed. Lidar depolarization measurements of wildfire smoke in the
stratosphere offer valuable insights into these properties, but additional measurements are
needed. Lidar depolarization measurements indicate that wildfire smoke in the stratosphere
is often non-spherical,63 but depolarization is an indirect measurement that does not uniquely
determine phase and viscosity.
7) Measurements should also differentiate between ordinary smoke particles slowly lofted into
the stratosphere and smoke rapidly injected into the stratosphere through large pyroCb
events. PyroCb smoke is processed through a cloud during its ascent. This could result in a
different mix of organic molecules than smoke that is not cloud-processed.
8) Our results suggest that aged BBOA and aged BBOA mixed with H2SO4 will be in a glassy
state for some conditions in the stratosphere. Previous studies have shown that certain types
of organic aerosols in a glassy state can nucleate ice heterogeneously.69–72 However, the ice
nucleation efficiency of glassy organic aerosols is still an area of active research.73 Studies
are needed to determine whether BBOA in a glassy state can nucleate crystalline PSCs.
9) We considered the uptake of water and H2SO4 by BBOA in the stratosphere. At the coldest
temperatures, BBOA particles can also take up nitric acid (HNO3), similar to background
H2SO4 particles in the stratosphere, which could further change the composition, and hence,
the viscosity of the wildfire smoke particles.74 Smoke particles can also take up HCl and
potentially other chlorine compounds.15 This uptake should be considered in future studies.
