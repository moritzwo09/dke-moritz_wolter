Abstract

36

Lake eutrophication affects the molecular composition of aquatic dissolved

37

organic matter (DOM) and halogenated disinfection byproducts (Xn-DBPs). However,

38

the effects of autochthonous DOM on the Xn-DBPs formation during disinfection of

39

natural eutrophic water from the perspective of biological metabolism are still poorly

40

revealed. Herein, the natural urban eutrophic lake (UEL) water with slight

41

eutrophication was employed to elucidate the discrepancies in Xn-DBPs formation

42

between autochthonous and allochthonous DOM based on the ultrahigh-resolution

43

mass spectrometry. The increased operational taxonomic units, microbial cell density

44

and relative abundance of genus Microcystis in the collected samples indicated the

45

slight algal bloom of the lake. The number and its proportion of nitrogenous Xn-DBPs

46

in chlorinated UEL water samples were significantly larger (p < 0.05) than those for

47

chlorinated SRNOM. Microbes dominated by Microcystis contributed largely to

48

releasing autochthonous DOM due to the microbial cell lysis and microbe-derived Xn-

49

DBPs species upon disinfection. The Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from

50

microorganisms were highly saturated, reduced, bioavailable, nitrogenous, and toxic

51

but lowly oxidized and aromatic than terrestrially derived Xn-DBPs species. Moreover,

52

for the first time, the connection between microbial lipid metabolism and Xn-DBPs

53

species exclusively identified in chlorinated UEL water indicated the considerable

54

contribution of lipid metabolites to saturated Xn-DBPs species. This study has

55

reported novel data interpretation paradigm for Xn-DBPs research, deepening our

56

understanding towards the formation mechanisms of microbe-derived Xn-DBPs

57

species from the view of microbial metabolic pathways.

1. Introductions

63

The water quality of lake, a major source of drinking water, is crucial to human

64

health and aquatic ecology. Disinfection with oxidative reagents is strongly

65

recommended for drinking water treatment to inhibit pathogenic bacterial growth 1.

66

However, the frequent occurrence of eutrophication not only deteriorates the lake

67

water quality 2, 3 but also yields more microbe-derived organic compounds in the

68

water with resultant high diversity of halogenated disinfection byproducts (Xn-DBPs,

69

X represents the halogen and n is the atom number of halogen) during the drinking

70

water disinfection 2-6.

71

Aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a highly complex mixture of various

72

autochthonous and allochthonous molecules 7. Autochthonous DOM (microbial

73

metabolites such as peptides and proteins) is mainly derived from normal metabolic

74

activities and released from cell lysis of algal microorganisms, including

75

cyanobacteria 2, 5, 8; while allochthonous DOM typically originates from terrestrial

76

input and is mainly composed of humic substances including lignin-like compounds 7.

77

In recent three decades, the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass

78

spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), providing ultrahigh mass resolution and the highest mass

79

accuracy, has been the state-of-the-art technology in elucidating the molecular

80

composition of DOM and Xn-DBPs 9, 10. The increasing lake trophic status will

81

release and accumulate autochthonous DOM characterized by more CHON

82

compounds, higher aliphatic content, and lower oxidation levels than allochthonous

83

molecules 2, 3. For example, DOM molecules positively correlated with total nitrogen

84

were in the compositional space of high H/C and low O/C values in the van Krevelen

85

diagram 2. The DOM molecules identified only in cyanobacterial bloom water and the

86

cyanobacterial extract contained more CHO, CHON, and CHONS compounds with

87

high H/C values than those identified only in the bloom-free water 5. Therefore,

88

elucidating the molecular composition of aquatic DOM using FT-ICR MS is expected

89

to provide valuable insights for the drinking water treatment of high trophic status

lake water.

91

Algal organic matter (AOM) released from the living and/or lytic algal cells

92

caused by disinfectants could react with disinfectants, forming harmful Xn-DBPs

93

species 4, 11. For example, cyanobacterial intracellular organic matter contributes to

94

the formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous Xn-DBPs during chlorination and

95

chloramination 12. Only 66 regulated and priority unregulated Xn-DBPs were

96

identified in algae-impacted waters during chlorination with more than two-folds of

97

total concentrations of Xn-DBPs and 2-3-fold increase in the toxicity of Xn-DBPs than

98

those for the algae-free water

99

regulated/known Xn-DBPs in these studies, a comprehensive analysis of numerous

100

unknown Xn-DBPs chemodiversity during disinfection of natural algae-containing

101

waters is unknown. In addition, autochthonous DOM exhibits distinct effects on

102

forming Xn-DBPs and their molecular characteristics, chemical components, and

103

resultant toxicity. For example, AOM generally contains more N-containing

104

compounds (partially amino acids), thus increasing the molecular diversity of the

105

more toxic Nn-DBPs species during disinfection than natural organic matter (NOM) 11,

106

15

107

drinking water due to its abundant N-containing precursors for Xn-DBPs formation 16.

108

Furthermore, O- and N-rich AOM precursors released from Microcystis aeruginosa

109

by algaecides were of higher unsaturation and more preferable to Xn-DBPs precursors

110

than wildfire ash-derived DOM

111

substantially increased the intensity and diversity of unknown Xn-DBPs species 18.

112

Moreover, the chlorination of AOM molecules yielded Xn-DBPs species with high

113

O/C and low H/C values, mainly from phenolic and unsaturated aliphatic precursors 19.

114

Similarly, The fatty acid-type Xn-DBPs with low unsaturation were the addition

115

reaction products of reactive chlorine species with aliphatic DOM precursors from

116

solid-phase extracted M. aeruginosa 20. The chlorination of plasma oxidated algal-

117

cultured medium yielded 2,486 N-free and 1,984 N-containing Xn-DBPs species, with

13, 14

. However, compared with few reported

17

118

the most abundant Xn-DBPs species of C11HnOmClx and C18HnNmOzClx, respectively 21.

119

However, all these FT-ICR MS-based Xn-DBPs studies were performed only using

120

pure cultured cyanobacterial cells (e.g., M. aeruginosa) disinfected in a well-

121

controlled laboratory environment. Effects of naturally occurring algal microorganism

122

growth in field eutrophic lake water on the Xn-DBPs formation remain largely

123

unknown at the molecular level.

124

Algae maintain their metabolic activities by consuming and releasing organic

125

molecules in surrounding waters 5, 22; these metabolites have been recognized to affect

126

Xn-DBPs formation during disinfection of algae-containing water profoundly. For

127

example, fatty acid molecules were identified as the algae-derived DOM precursors

128

for Cl1-5-DBPs species during chlorinating M. aeruginosa-containing water 20.

129

However, the specific microbial metabolites involved in forming Xn-DBPs species are

130

still poorly known. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)

131

metabolome database is a valuable tool to reveal possible metabolic pathways by

132

linking DOM molecules in field eutrophic waters to the metabolic pathways of algal

133

microorganisms. For example, the “biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites”

134

revealed by the KEGG metabolic pathways was the dominant DOM molecule in

135

Taihu Lake 5. Therefore, the detailed investigation of the relationship between Xn-

136

DBPs precursors and microbial metabolic pathways is expected to contribute to an in-

137

depth understanding of the microbial metabolic source of Xn-DBPs precursors during

138

disinfection of natural eutrophic source water.

139

The main objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effect of the

140

microbial growth dominated by cyanobacteria on the molecular composition and

141

chemodiversity of DOM and Xn-DBPs in natural waters and (2) to link the microbial

142

metabolic pathways with precursor compounds and resultant Xn-DBPs species by

143

integrating the ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and KEGG

144

database. The discrepancy between autochthonous DOM and allochthonous DOM in

145

Xn-DBPs formation was also examined.

2. Materials and Methods

147

2.1 Sample preparation

148

The investigated lake (Lake A) is a significant drinking water source for

149

residents in satellite towns of the Kanto area, Japan, and has been listed as a typical

150

urban eutrophic lake (UEL) (https://www.env.go.jp/en/water/wq/lakes/issue.html,

151

Figures S1 and S2). Therefore, the raw UEL water from Lake A, as a representative

152

natural and eutrophic water, was periodically sampled during the typical algal bloom

153

season (August 2020). Specifically, four raw UEL water samples were collected from

154

Lake A on August 07, 14, 21, and 28, 2020. The physicochemical variables of all

155

water samples were tabulated in Table S1. Granular active carbon (GAC), a

156

promising sorption material for DOM removal 23, was employed to simulate the

157

chlorination scenario in the drinking water treatment. Specifically, the UEL water

158

collected on 28th August (UEL28) was treated using GAC at room temperature in the

159

dark (UEL28+GAC), followed by filtration with a 0.45 μm membrane. A part of each

160

water was prefiltered with a 0.45 µm membrane to remove cyanobacterial cells

161

(typically 0.5 to 60 μm) for further disinfection (UEL+ClOPF). In contrast, another

162

portion of the UEL water was disinfected without prefiltration (UEL+ClOF). All raw

163

water with or without prefiltration was subjected to chlorination using 5.0 mg/L

164

NaClO (expressed as free chlorine concentration determined by the colorimetric

165

method of N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine with a pocket colorimeter) without

166

adjusting pH to simulate the chlorination scenario in the drinking water treatment

167

plant. All chlorinated samples were incubated for 7 days at room temperature under

168

the dark and then filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane for the DOM extraction.

169

Three natural water samples without eutrophication (referred to as background

170

samples) were collected from the urban lake or river geographically close (8 - 27 km

171

distance) to the Lake A in later autumn or winter (Content S1) to represent the

172

terrestrially dominated waters with ignorable autochthonous components of water

173

eutrophication. The collected background samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm

174

membrane for the DOM extraction immediately after transferring to the laboratory. In

175

addition to UEL water DOM with autochthonous and allochthonous components, the

176

Suwannee River NOM (SRNOM, 2R101N, purchased from International Humic

177

Substances Society) was employed as the representative of terrestrially derived DOM

178

24

179

DOM on the Xn-DBPs formation. The FT-ICR MS data of the two SRNOM standards

180

(SRNOM1 and SRNOM2, respectively) and their chlorinated samples were collected

181

from our previous studies 25, 26. Briefly, 2 L SRNOM1 (3.0 mg-C/L) and SRNOM2

182

(50.0 mg-C/L) were chlorinated with 5.0 mg/L and 50 mg/L NaClO, respectively. The

183

residual chlorine in the SRNOM1 was 3.58 ± 0.02 mg/L after 7-day incubation

184

(Figure S3). The chlorinated SRNOM solutions were incubated for 7 days at room

185

temperature in the dark without adjusting the solution pH, then filtered through a 0.45

186

μm membrane for the solid-phase extraction (SPE). The sample treatments are

187

detailed in Table S2. (Zhang et al., 2014; Zhang and Yang, 2018)

, to tentatively discern the different effects of autochthonous and allochthonous

188

The DOM from all samples was purified with SPE extraction according to the

189

procedures described elsewhere 27. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to acidify

190

sample to evaluate SPE recovery and avoid the adverse effects of high concentration

191

of non-violate sulfurate on the FT-ICR MS instrument. Briefly, all filtered samples

192

were acidified to pH ≈ 2 using concentrated HCl and then gravitationally passed

193

through the SPE cartridges (Bond Elut PPL cartridges (1 g and 6 mL, Agilent, USA)

194

rinsed and activated with 6 mL of methanol (LC-MS grade, Kanto Chemical, Japan).

195

The cartridges were desalted using 20 mL HCl (pH ≈ 2), followed by 6 mL ultrapure

196

water, and then thoroughly dried using N2 gas (≥ 99.9% purity). DOM molecules

197

were finally eluted with 6 mL methanol.

198

The centrifugal concentrator (CVE-2200, EYELA, Japan) was used to

199

completely dry the aliquot (0.2 mL) of each SPE-extracted DOM, followed by

200

redissolving in ultrapure water. A total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (TOC 4100,

201

Shimadzu, Japan) was employed to determine the TOC of all samples. The TOC

202

concentration and SPE recovery of DOM were averaged at 1.55 mg/L and 64.04%,

203

respectively. All eluted DOM samples were diluted with an identical volume of

204

ultrapure water (1: 1, v: v) for FT-ICR MS measurement.

205

2.2 DNA extraction and microbial community analysis

206

The microbial DNA extraction and microbial community analysis were described

207

in Content S2.

208

2.3 FT-ICR MS measurement

209

The FT-ICR MS spectra of 16 SPE-extracted DOM samples were measured by a

210

9.4 Telsa FT-ICR MS (SolariX XR, Bruker Daltonics Inc., Germany) in the negative

211

electrospray ionization mode at Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, with the following

212

instrument parameters tabulated in Table S3: 150-1000 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z),

213

450 average scans, 2MWord data size, -4.5 kV capillary voltage, 150 µL/h direct

214

infusion rate, and 1 ms ion accumulation time 25. All spectra were externally

215

calibrated with ion clusters using the NaI solution before FT-ICR MS measurement

216

and then internally calibrated with known CHO-homologous series to ensure the mass

217

accuracy of entire spectra within 1.0 ppm.

218

2.4 Data analysis

219

Given the few structural isomers for Xn-DBPs with three C atoms (C3-DBPs) and

220

their difficulties in the tandem mass spectrometry measurement, the toxicities of C3-

221

DBPs were evaluated based on their retrieved structures from the PubChem in this

222

study. The ecotoxicity and predicted physical-chemical properties (probability for

223

rapid biodegradation and biotransformation half-life) of some typical highly saturated

224

C3-DBPs species including all their isomers were assessed by the quantitative

225

structure-activity

226

Relationships software 28, 29 and EPI SuiteTM software by U.S. EPA (Version 4.11) 30,

227

respectively (Content S6). Based on the Globally Harmonized System of

228

Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS), the predicted toxicity for organic

chemicals was divided into four levels: not harmful (LC50/EC50 ≥ 100 mg/L), harmful

The FT-ICR MS data analysis, statistical analysis, and KEGG data analysis were

3. Results and Discussion

235

3.1 Bacterial community structure during algal bloom

236

The number of OTUs (11042 - 13289) and microbial cell density (103.78 - 106.08

237

cell/mL) gradually increased during the algal bloom season in Lake A, suggesting

238

elevating levels of microbes, including algae, during the sampling period (Figure 1A).

239

The abundance of the four sample species at the phylum level illustrated in Figure 1B

240

reveals that Proteobacteria (relative abundance of 36.07%), Firmicutes (21.92%), and

241

Cyanobacteria (15.86%) were the three most prevalent phyla in samples collected on

242

7th August (UEL07). Contrasting to the considerably decreased relative abundance of

243

Firmicutes after three weeks of natural algae growth, the relative abundance of

244

Cyanobacteria increased to 53.55% in sample UEL28. Proteobacteria and

245

Cyanobacteria were the most abundant during algal blooms in Lake A. Furthermore,

246

it can be clearly shown that the bacterial communities changed with the

247

eutrophication processing at the family and genus levels (Figure 1). For example,

248

Exiguobacterium sp. was dominant in the UEL07 sample, accounting for 20.43% of

249

the total abundance, but was decreased to 0.02% in the UEL28 sample. Compared to

250

the sample UEL07, the relative abundance of Microcystis in UEL28 increased from

251

0.00% to 47.32%, suggesting that Microcystis was the key contributor to algal bloom

252

in Lake A. The equal abundance noticed for the family Microcystaceae in UEL28 (i.e.,

253

47.32%) also indicates that no genera other than Microcystis from such a family were

254

identified. These results demonstrated that Microcystis was the dominant microbial

255

species responsible for the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake A from August 07 to 28,

256

2020, which was consistent with the previous finding that Microcystis were the

257

predominant species in Lake A during cyanobacterial seasonal succession in late

258

August 31.

259

M. aeruginosa, the major species of the genus Microcystis, are frequently

260

detected in bloom-forming cyanobacteria in natural and engineered waters 19, 21. The

261

AOM molecules from M. aeruginosa had been recognized as reactive Xn-DBPs

262

precursors upon chlorination because of their higher average C number and lower

263

average oxygen number than those for terrestrial DOM 17. The concentrations of N0-

264

DBPs (N-free Xn-DBPs) and Nn>0-DBPs (N-bearing Xn-DBPs) species were found to

265

increase with the algae growth due to the discrepancy in organic matter composition

266

at different growth stages of M. aeruginosa 32. The high residual chlorine and

267

extended growth periods of algal cells promoted the formation of Xn-DBPs species

268

with more chlorine 32, 33. The prevalence of cyanobacteria, including M. aeruginosa

269

demonstrates the autochthonous and allochthonous DOM molecules in Lake A,

270

suggesting the possible formation of more toxic Nn>0-DBPs and/or Cln≥2-DBPs

271

species in the UEL water.

samples.

3.2 Molecular composition of DOM and Xn-DBPs species affected by microbial

278

growth

279

In addition to the similar overall FT-ICR MS spectra profile (Figure S4), minor

280

differences were observed for UEL water DOM samples collected during microbial

281

growth with the respects of number and intensity proportion of different molecular

282

compositions (Figure S5). This finding was further supported by the visual similarity

283

between UEL28 and other raw UEL water samples in the van Krevelen diagram based

12

284

on the inter-sample ranking analysis, suggesting minor temporal-spatial variations in

285

DOM molecular composition (Figure S6). Similar results were also identified for the

286

intensity-weighted values of molecular parameters, including m/ziw, H/Ciw, O/Ciw,

287

AImod, iw, DBEiw, and NOSCiw (Figure S7). However, the gradually elevating N/Ciw

288

value (Figure S7E) demonstrated the increase of N-containing compounds in the

289

UEL water caused by microbial growth. Compared to the SRNOM samples, a series

290

of N-containing compounds (e.g., C10H7N1O4 and C15H25N1O7S1) with a gradual

291

increase in their peak intensities were detected in the UEL water samples during

292

microbial growth (Figure S8), which was consistent with the N-rich nature of AOM 20.

293

The minor difference in the overall molecular composition of UEL water DOM during

294

the sampling period in this study could be attributed to the dominated allochthonous

295

molecules in the slightly eutrophicated Lake A. In contrast, the microbial growth

296

resulted in the continuous release of autochthonous molecules into the Lake A water.

297

The different overall profile of FT-ICR MS spectra for UEL water samples from

298

those for two raw SRNOM samples (Figure S4) could be mainly attributed to the

299

autochthonous molecules in the natural eutrophic water in this study. The UEL water

DOM contained more CHON-class and saturated compounds but fewer CHO-class

301

and tannin-like compounds than SRNOM (Figure S5). Indeed, formulae in the ranks

302

1-6 (relatively high mass peak intensities) of SRNOM2 featured more relative

303

oxygen-rich and hydrogen-poor components (e.g., tannin-like CHO-type compounds)

304

compared to the UEL water DOM (Figure S6). The UEL water DOM peaks were

305

distributed mainly at a lower m/z (~150 to ~600), yielding lower m/ziw values than

306

those of SRNOM (~250 to ~800) (Figure S4 and S7B). Furthermore, the UEL water

307

DOM had higher H/Ciw and N/Ciw but fewer formulae and lower O/Ciw, AImod, iw,

308

DBEiw, and NOSCiw than those of SRNOM (Figure S7). These results suggest the

309

dominance of more saturated and aliphatic but less oxidized and aromatic compounds

310

in UEL water than in the SRNOM, which could be attributed to autochthonous

311

compounds 3, 34 and contributed considerably to the formation of aliphatic Xn>0-DBPs

313

In this study, the conventional H/C in the van Krevelen diagram was replaced by

314

(H+X)/C to visually characterize the Xn-DBPs and their putative precursors 25. The

315

Xn-DBPs species identified only in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1

316

background sample were considered the Xn-DBPs mainly derived from microbial

317

activities. Furthermore, Cl-containing molecules identified both in the raw SRNOM

318

and the corresponding chlorinated SRNOM samples were considered as the possible

319

Cl-adduct resulting from samples acidification by HCl. Only 15 and 7 possible Cl-

320

adducts were found in the chlorinated SRNOM1 and SRNOM2 samples, accounting

321

for < 3% and < 1% of the number of all Xn-DBPs in the chlorinated SRNOM1 and

322

SRNOM2 samples, respectively. These results suggested that the potential Cl-adduct

323

artifact induced by HCl had minor impact on the main conclusion of this study. In

324

contrast to the decreasing number of chlorinated organic compounds (from 107 to 59

325

on 07 and 28 August, respectively, Figures 2 and S9), an insignificant difference

326

(p > 0.05) was observed in the number-average molecular characteristics, including

327

m/z, DBE, (H+X)/C, NOSC, Cl/C, and AImod among all UEL water samples without

328

chlorination from 07 August to 28 August (Figure S10). Compared with the raw UEL

329

water without chlorination, chlorination resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in

330

the intensities and number of chlorinated organic compounds, including Xn-DBPs, in

331

all UEL water samples, suggesting the occurrence of Xn-DBPs species induced by

332

chlorination. Additionally, the Xn-DBPs number in chlorinated UEL water samples

333

with prefiltration decreased from 1117 (excluding isotopic formula, accounting for

334

17.00% and 27.44% of the number and intensity of all assigned peaks, respectively,

335

07 August) to 480 (6.22% and 9.13%, 14 August), followed by an increase to 693

336

(10.58% and 35.06%) on 28 August (Figures 2 and S9). While the Xn-DBPs number

337

in chlorinated UEL water samples without prefiltration decreased from 1147 (20.52%

338

and 34.94% of number and intensity percentages, respectively, 07 August) to 494

339

(8.42% and 10.53% of number and intensity percentages, respectively, 21 August),

340

followed by an increase to 1097 (16.22% and 30.39% of number and intensity

341

percentages, respectively) on 28 August. Similar results were also observed for the

342

number and proportion of saturated Xn-DBPs in chlorinated UEL water samples with

343

and without prefiltration (Figures 2 and S9), suggesting that the identified saturated

344

Xn-DBPs species were mainly derived from microbial growth. This conclusion is

345

further supported by the consistent changing tendency of the number and proportion

346

of Nn>0-DBPs species in chlorinated UEL water samples without prefiltration with the

347

relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and the N/Ciw value in the raw UEL water

348

samples during the sampling period (Figures 1B, S7E, and S11). Moreover, the

349

number of CHON and CHONS newly assigned in the UEL+ClOPF increased from

350

705 on 07 August to 1329 on 28 August and 391 on 07 August to 851 on 28 August,

351

respectively. Similarly, the number of CHON and CHONS newly assigned in the

352

UEL+ClOF increased from 260 on 07 August to 897 on 28 August and 279 on 07

353

August to 390 on 28 August, respectively (Figure S12). These results are consistent

354

with previous findings that the increased Xn-DBPs species by the microbial growth in

355

the UEL water 32, 33 could be attributed to the release of autochthonous precursors 17.

356

The Xn-DBPs species in all chlorinated UEL water samples exhibited similar

357

compositional space in the van Krevelen diagram (Figures 2 and S9). However,

358

differing from the dominated lignin-like Xn-DBPs species in the chlorinated SRNOM,

359

the majority of Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from microbial activities are of a

360

saturated nature (Figures 2 and S9) 20. Indeed, 62 - 233 of Xn-DBPs species with

361

(H+X)/C ≥ 1.5, accounting for 74.70% - 92.96% number of all Xn-DBPs species,

362

were identified exclusively in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background

363

sample. The greater extent of unsaturation and oxidation of DOM molecules

364

correlated positively with their larger positive (DBE-0.5O)/C and NOSC values,

365

respectively 35. In this study, the majority of Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from

366

microbial activities in all disinfected UEL water samples were reduced compounds,

367

accounting for 38.19% - 60.24% number of unsaturated compounds and 6.02% 15

368

32.16% of saturated compounds (Figure S13)35. The chlorinated UEL28 with

369

prefiltration had significantly lower (p < 0.05) m/z, DBE, NOSC, and AImod but higher

370

(p < 0.05) (H+X)/C than other chlorinated UEL water samples with prefiltration

371

(Figure S10). For chlorinated UEL water samples without prefiltration, no significant

372

difference (p > 0.05) was observed in these molecular characteristics between UEL28

373

and other UEL water samples. These results suggested the difference in the effects of

374

chlorination with and without prefiltration on the molecular characteristics and

375

composition of Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from microbial activities in UEL

376

water.

3.3 Effects of cell lysis on the Xn-DBPs formation

388

Effects of the autochthonous DOM derived from microbial (dominated by

389

cyanobacteria, Figure 1) cell lysis during chlorination on the Xn-DBPs formation

390

were examined by comparing the Xn-DBPs formation in the chlorinated UEL water

391

samples with prefiltration (UEL+ClOPF) with that for the chlorinated UEL water

392

samples without prefiltration (UEL+ClOF). The total number of all Xn-DBPs species

393

in the four chlorinated UEL water samples without prefiltration was more than that for

394

the four chlorinated UEL water samples with prefiltration (3810 versus 2815, Figure

395

S13). Furthermore, the total number of unique Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from

396

microbial activities in the chlorinated UEL water samples without prefiltration was

397

slightly larger than that for the chlorinated UEL water samples with prefiltration (861

398

versus 806, Figure S13). The number of unique Xn-DBPs species for treatments with

399

prefiltration was comparable to those without prefiltration (1468 versus 1524, Figure

400

S14). From the intersection of only chlorinated UEL water samples with and without

401

prefiltration, the shared Xn-DBPs species composed the subset with the largest

402

number (567, Figure S14B). These results suggest chlorination of UEL water without

403

prefiltration yielded more Xn-DBPs species mainly derived from microbial cell lysis

404

than that with prefiltration. Notably, all regulated Xn-DBPs compounds (66 regulated

405

Xn-DBPs) reported by previous studies 12-14 were not identified in this study,

406

highlighting the significance of comprehensive characterization of unregulated and

407

unknown Xn-DBPs. In addition, Compared with 3871 and 2807 Xn-DBPs in the

408

chlorinated algal-cultured samples with and without pre-ozonation, respectively18,

409

1524 and 1468 unique Xn-DBPs (excluding isotopic formulae) identified in the

410

chlorinated UEL water samples with and without prefiltration, respectively (Figure

415

water samples with and without prefiltration (Figure S15). A series of Xn-DBPs

416

species containing N and multiple Cl atoms were identified in the chlorinated UEL28

417

water without prefiltration but absent in the chlorinated UEL28 water with

418

prefiltration, SRNOM1, SRNOM2, chlorinated SRNOM1, and chlorinated SRNOM2

419

(Figure S16). For example, intensities of C2H1O1N2Cl4 and C3H2O3N1S1Cl5 peaks in

420

the chlorinated UEL28 water without prefiltration were approximately 18- and 6-fold

421

of those in the raw and chlorinated UEL28 water with prefiltration, respectively

422

(Figure S16). These Xn-DBPs species containing heteroatoms (N and S) and multiple

423

Cl atoms generally have higher ecological risks than those for nitrogen-free Xn-DBPs

424

species with fewer Cl atoms 36. These observations could be attributed to the

425

additional release of AOM from disinfected algal cells in the UEL water chlorinated

426

without prefiltration compared with that chlorinated after filtration, which further

427

reacts with reactive chlorine to form more chlorinated DBPs 20, 37. Moreover, the Xn-

428

DBPs species only in the chlorinated UEL water sample without prefiltration had

429

significantly lower (p < 0.05) O/C but higher (p < 0.05) N/C and (H+X)/C values than

430

those for the Xn-DBPs species both in chlorinated UEL water samples with and

431

without prefiltration (0.48 ± 0.20 versus 0.50 ± 0.15, 0.04 ± 0.08 versus 0.02 ± 0.06,

432

and 1.46 ± 0.37 versus 1.42 ± 0.32, respectively). These results indicate the

433

prevalence of highly saturated and N-containing Xn-DBPs species in the chlorinated

434

UEL water without prefiltration, most likely derived from microbial activities.

435

The number and its proportion of Nn>0-DBPs in disinfected UEL water samples

436

were significantly larger (p < 0.05) than those for disinfected SRNOM (8 - 206 versus

437

0 - 4 and 1.60% - 29.70% versus 0% - 0.4%, Figure S11). Moreover, as shown in

438

Figure S14C, the number of unique Nn>0-DBPs in disinfected UEL water samples

439

with and without prefiltration (357 and 230, respectively) was also overwhelmingly

440

larger than that for disinfected SRNOM samples (4). The Xn-DBPs formulae

441

identified in disinfected SRNOM samples were clustered between 0.5 < (H+X)/C <

442

1.4 and 0.4 < O/C < 0.9 in the van Krevelen diagram, with the dominant components

443

of lignin-like and tannin-like compounds 25 (Figures 2 and S9). However, the

444

molecular composition of Xn-DBPs species identified in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water

445

samples and ≤ 1 background sample were more diverse (mainly 1.25 < (H+X)/C < 2.0

446

and 0.2 < O/C < 0.6), with more assigned formulae (i.e., aminosugar-like and

447

saturated compounds). Although most Xn-DBPs species in both disinfected UEL

448

water and disinfected SRNOM samples were unsaturated compounds, the Xn-DBPs

449

species identified in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background sample

450

contained more reduced compounds and scattered in regions II (unsaturated and

451

reduced) and III (saturated and reduced) within plots of (DBE-0.5O)/C against NOSC

452

(Figure S13). Compared with disinfected SRNOM, 5 - 74 Xn-DBPs species identified

453

in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background sample were ascribed to

454

saturated and reduced compounds (Figure S13). This observation indicated that Xn-

455

DBPs precursors in disinfected UEL water samples were more saturated and reduced

456

than in disinfected SRNOM. Moreover, the disinfected SRNOM samples contain

457

significantly higher m/z, DBE, NOSC, AImod, Cl/C, and lower (H+X)/C values than

458

disinfected UEL water samples (p < 0.05), suggesting higher saturation and lower

459

aromaticity of Xn-DBPs species in disinfected UEL water samples.

460

There were 789 unique high bioavailable Xn-DBPs species ((H+X)/C ≥ 1.5,

461

excluding isotopic formulae) identified in the UEL water with the number- and

462

intensity-averaged

463

C13.84H22.77O5.36N0.33S0.03Cl1.57, but absent in the chlorinated SRNOM solution 38, 39.

464

For example, the Xn-DBPs species with three carbons and (H+X)/C ≥ 1.5 identified in

465

this study had low predicted biotransformation half-life (0.02 - 1.67 days) (Table S5),

466

suggesting the high bioavailability of those Xn-DBPs species 39. Compared with Xn-

467

DBPs species exclusively in SRNOM, the Xn-DBPs only present in the UEL water

468

were generally saturated and N-rich, suggesting the obviously different molecular

469

properties of autochthonous precursors and allochthonous precursors for Xn-DBPs

470

formation 20. These results indicated that microbial growth would promote the

and

471

formation of bioavailable Xn-DBPs species during the disinfection process. The

472

molecular formulae of these saturated Xn-DBPs species exclusively in the disinfected

473

UEL water were typically assigned to CnH2nO3-5Cl2 and CnH2n+1O2-4Cl1 series (n is an

474

integer, 8 ≤ n ≤ 19) (Figure S17). The CH2 homologous series of these typical Xn-

475

DBPs were related to alkyl chain elongation and chemical reactions, including

476

methylation/demethylation reactions 40. Moreover, the Cl5-DBPs ([C3H4O2Cl4·Cl]-,

477

m/z = 246.865941) and Cl6-DBPs ([C3H3O2Cl5·Cl]-, m/z = 280.826969) ions were

478

identified as the Cl-adduct ions (Figure 3) because HCl was not added to the neutral

479

formulae (C3H4O2Cl4 and C3H3O2Cl5, DBE=0) by addition reaction; otherwise, the

480

neutral chemical formulae were chemical impossible. There were 119 Cln≥2-DBPs

481

identified in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background sample, further

482

supporting that saturated Xn-DBPs species containing multiple chlorine atoms in the

483

chlorinated UEL water was mainly derived from microbial activities.

The possible chemical structures of all Xn-DBPs species with 3 carbons

491

identified in this study were retrieved from the PubChem database due to their high

492

bioavailability ((H+X)/C ≥ 1.5) 39 (Table S5). The DBE value of a typical saturated

493

Xn-DBPs compound, C3H4O2Cl4 (Figure 3A), was zero, suggesting its absence of

494

double bond and the impossibility of forming the false true ion [C3H5O2Cl5]- (DBE =

the highest toxicity for green algae (96-h LC50 = 0.2 mg/L, Figure S18 and Table S5),

related to its N-rich nature 36, 41. The LC50 and EC50 values of C3-bearing Xn-DBPs

510

species detected only in the disinfected UEL water samples were significantly (p <

511

0.05) lower than those for C3-bearing Xn-DBPs species in all disinfected samples

512

(Figure S18). Moreover, three C3-bearing Xn-DBPs detected both in chlorinated UEL

513

water and SRNOM samples were classified as harmless (LC50/EC50 values of

514

C3H3O3Cl3, C3H2O1Cl4, and C3H1O1Cl5 were 849.3 -3520.0 mg/L, 274.5 - 1086.6

515

mg/L, and 128.0 - 365.6 mg/L, respectively). The predicted toxicity of C3-bearing N0-

516

DBPs species was generally positively related to their Cl atom number 36. For

517

example, the averaged predicted toxicity of 96-h LC50 for fish was in the order of

518

C3H4O2Cl4 (least toxic, 195.5 mg/L) < C3H3O1Cl5 (moderate toxic, 74.0 mg/L) <

519

C3H2O1Cl6 (most toxic, 28.4 mg/L). In contrast, the toxic order of 48-h LC50 for

520

daphnid was C3H3O3Cl3 (least toxic, 849.3 mg/L) < C3H2O1Cl4 (moderate toxic, 557.4

521

mg/L) < C3H1O1Cl5 (most toxic, 200.0 mg/L, Figure S18). Although the toxicity of a

522

limited number of highly saturated DBPs was evaluated in this study, these results

523

have highlighted the different molecular diversity and toxicity of microbe-derived and

524

terrestrially Xn-DBPs species. Additionally, two highly saturated C3-bearing Xn-DBPs

525

[C3H3O3N1S1Cl4 (identified in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water samples and ≤ 1

526

background sample) and C3H2O3N1S1Cl5] were detected only in disinfected UEL

527

water samples. However, no information about these two highly saturated C3-bearing

528

Xn-DBPs is retrievable in the PubChem database, highlighting the necessity of

529

investigating unknown Xn-DBPs species derived from microbial activities.

3.4 Metabolic pathways responses for Xn-DBPs formation

531

The metabolic pathways collated in the KEGG metabolome database revealed

532

the microbial metabolic pathway for Xn-DBPs precursors determined according to the

533

reaction stoichiometry of the substitution and addition reactions 26. In total, 240 and

534

981 precursors were identified exclusively in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and

535

≤ 1 background sample (Table S6), and both in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples

536

and chlorinated SRNOM, respectively. There were 392 and 1,003 KEGG compounds

537

matched for these precursors, respectively (Table S7). Moreover, 20 and 66 KEGG

538

compounds in metabolic pathway maps were identified for the precursors exclusively

539

in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background sample, and both in ≥ 5

540

chlorinated UEL water and chlorinated SRNOM samples, respectively (Figures 4 and

541

Table S7). There were 10 and 33 unique structures retrieved from the KEGG database

542

for these KEGG compounds, respectively. The metabolites involved in the metabolic

543

pathways of these precursors were then scattered in the KEGG metabolic pathway

544

map. As depicted in Figure 4, “lipid metabolism” is an important metabolic pathway

545

for these precursors exclusively in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1

546

background sample (7 KEGG compounds). In comparison, precursors both in ≥ 5

547

chlorinated UEL water and chlorinated SRNOM samples (1 KEGG compound) were

548

less involved in this metabolic pathway (Figure 4 and Table S7). Moreover, no

549

KEGG compounds in metabolic pathway maps were identified for the precursors

550

exclusively in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≥ 2 background samples. The

551

unique and considerable contribution of lipid metabolism to the precursors

552

exclusively identified in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background

553

sample suggests that lipid metabolism is an important metabolic pathway of microbe-

554

derived precursors because of the absence of related KEGG compound identified in

555

chlorinated SRNOM and ≥ 2 background samples. Thus, the saturated Xn-DBPs

556

species is expected to be generated from highly saturated autochthonous precursors

557

yielded by lipid metabolism. Moreover, amino acid metabolism (6 KEGG compound)

558

is also involved in the synthesis of precursors mainly derived from microbial activities,

559

followed by the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (4 KEGG compound),

560

nucleotide metabolism (2 KEGG compound), and carbohydrate metabolism (1 KEGG

561

compound).

chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1 background sample: Lipid metabolism (A);

571

Amino acid metabolism (B); Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (C); Nucleotide

572

metabolism (D); and Carbohydrate metabolism (E). The dominant type of metabolism

573

highlighted with green circles is lipid metabolism. Note that dots of different colours

may overlap.

575

The KEGG compounds identified in the lipid metabolic pathway were mainly

576

responsible for lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and

577

alpha-linolenic acid metabolism (Figure 4). Over 40 Cl1-5-DBPs species were

578

identified from fatty acids during the disinfection of M. aeruginosa cells 20. For

579

example, a series of Cln-DBPs species was formed from the reaction between active

580

chlorine and fatty acids, including linoleic acid (C18H32O2), γ-linolenic acid

581

(C18H30O2), stearidonic acid (C18H28O2), and 17-hydroxylinolenic acid (C18H30O3).

582

Indeed, KEGG-matched precursors identified only in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water

583

samples and ≤ 1 background sample were featured in a high degree of C-C bond

584

saturation (-1 ≤ DBE-0.5O ≤ 4, Table S8). These precursors could be assigned to fatty

585

acid molecules containing several hydroxyl and/or carboxyl functional groups and

586

double bonds because negative and positive values of DBE-0.5O signify the presence

587

of saturated function groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methoxy, or ether groups) and

588

unsaturated functional groups (e.g., double bonds and rings) in a molecule 42. In this

589

study, 14 unique formulae of KEGG-matched precursors were related to 32 saturated

590

Cl1-5-DBPs species (Tables S8 and S9). There were six saturated Cl1-DBPs

591

(C10H13O5N2Cl1, C10H15O5N2Cl1, C16H29O4Cl1, C16H31O5Cl1, C18H31O5Cl1, and

592

C18H33O5Cl1) exclusively identified in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water samples and ≤ 1

593

background sample (Table S9). The KEGG-matched precursors exclusively in ≥ 5

594

disinfected UEL water samples exhibited distinct compositional space in the van

595

Krevelen diagram, which differed from that observed both in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL

596

water and chlorinated SRNOM samples. In addition to more N-containing compounds,

597

most KEGG-matched precursors detected exclusively in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water

598

samples and ≤ 1 background sample was saturated, aminosugar-like, and reduced

599

compounds (Figure S19). The microbial oxidation (such as aerobic respiration) of

600

highly oxidized (higher NOSC) DOM is more thermodynamically favorable and tends

601

to be removed or consumed 43, 44. The NOSC and ΔGoCox values of Xn-DBPs

602

precursors detected exclusively in ≥ 5 disinfected UEL water samples and ≤ 1
25

603

background sample were significantly lower and higher (p < 0.05) than those for the

604

precursors identified both in ≥ 5 chlorinated UEL water and chlorinated SRNOM

605

samples (Figure S20), suggesting that autochthonous Xn-DBPs precursors exclusively

606

identified in the UEL water were less thermodynamically favourable and easily

607

consumed, thus yielding higher ecological and human risks than allochthonous Xn-

608

DBPs precursors.

609

4. Environmental Implications

610

Contrasting to the SRNOM, a representative of terrestrially derived aquatic

611

NOM 24, the UEL water has more autochthonous and bioavailable Xn-DBPs

612

precursors. In addition to the investigated Lake A, eutrophication and algal blooms

613

were often reported in other drinking water sources, such as Biwa Lake in Japan 45,

614

Okeechobee Lake in the USA 46 and Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, and East Lake in

615

China 2, 47. Although slight eutrophication exhibited minor effects on the molecular

616

composition of aquatic DOM, results of this study have demonstrated that substantial

617

microbial growth yields more autochthonous DOM and promotes the formation of

618

more highly saturated and bioavailable Xn-DBPs species in Lake A upon disinfection.

619

Furthermore, these Xn-DBPs species with multiple N and Cl atoms (e.g., unknown

620

C3H3O3N1S1Cl4 and C3H3O3N1S1Cl5) mainly derived from autochthonous DOM and

621

generally more toxic than allochthonous-derived Xn-DBPs species, highlighting the

622

significance of appropriate treatments for eutrophic source water before disinfection.

623

In this study, compared with few known regulated Xn-DBPs, the structure and toxicity

624

of the approximately 1,500 unique unknown Xn-DBPs (including 272 microbe-

625

derived Xn-DBPs) identified in the chlorinated UEL water samples with or without

626

prefiltration warrants further investigation. Additionally, the similar molecular

627

properties (i.e., saturated and reduced fractions) of DOM compounds in the

628

UEL28+GAC sample to microbial-derived Xn-DBPs precursors (Figures S21, S22

629

and Table S11) suggest that autochthonous DOM in GAC-treated eutrophic lake

630

water will contribute to the formation of microbial-derived DBPs. Elucidating the
26

631

chemical composition of DOM contributes primarily to tracking and restoring the

632

health of fresh waters 48. In this study, for the first time, the relationship between

633

microbial metabolism and Xn-DBPs species was established by linking Xn-DBPs

634

precursors with the KEGG compounds, which enables the in-depth tracking of the

635

sources of autochthonous Xn-DBPs precursors in terms of metabolic pathways. In

636

addition to the unique contribution of lipid metabolism, other metabolisms (e.g.,

637

amino acid metabolism) are also crucial for the precursors identified only in the

638

chlorinated natural water with algae, suggesting that these microbial biometabolites

639

are most likely involved in forming microbe-derived Xn-DBPs species during

640

disinfection.

641

In

eutrophic

lakes,

various

autochthonous

biometabolites,

including

642

carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, are present throughout the year 5. The molecular

643

composition of DOM in eutrophic lakes (e.g., Taihu Lake) is dominated by microbial

644

metabolism in a temporal-dependent manner 5. For example, the abundance of

645

cyanobacteria gradually increased from August to the highest level in September,

646

followed by a gradual decrease in October 31. Thus, microbial metabolism (e.g., lipid

647

metabolism) is expected to be more significant during the growth phase in the summer.

648

Algae cells yield the highest DOM per cell during the late exponential or death phase

649

11

650

Therefore, it is expected that the release of autochthonous DOM and the formation of

651

microbe-derived Xn-DBPs during disinfection will be more significant when algae in

652

the UEL water is in the late exponential or death phase. Moreover, the inactivation of

653

pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli) using bactericides in water will release

654

autochthonous substances, such as proteins, from the pathogenic cells 49. These results

655

suggest that disinfection may cause the release of different autochthonous substances

656

from different microbes, which consequently contributes to the formation of different

657

Xn-DBPs species. Although the inactivation of pathogenic bacteria and the detection

658

of Xn-DBPs species have been extensively reported, the connection between

. In this study, the algae were generally in the lag or early exponential phase.

659

microbial metabolism and microbe-derived Xn-DBPs species is generally overlooked.

660

In addition to the important role of the precursors mainly derived from microbial

661

activities in the formation of highly saturated Xn-DBPs species with high ecological

662

and health risks upon the disinfection, this study has highlighted the significance of

663

linking microbial metabolism with Xn-DBPs species to shed new insights in treatment

664

and governance of eutrophic source water.
