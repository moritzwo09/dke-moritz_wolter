Abstract
Enzymatic decarboxylation of phenolic acids enables the production of biobased phenolic styrenes
under mild reaction conditions. However, the free para-phenolic group can lead to undesirable side
products during polymerization, giving protection of the free phenolic OH group critical importance for
the application in adhesives. Here we present a one-pot two-step cascade reaction, in which phenolic
acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPAD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of coumaric acid,
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid, followed by O-methylation of the intermediate phenolic
styrenes by resveratrol O-methyltransferase from Vitis vinifera (VvROMT). The reaction sequence
avoids the isolation and purification of the reactive intermediate phenolic styrenes. The Omethyltransferase shows selectivity towards the phenolic styrenes. Characterization of a set of variants
with amino acid substitution in the active-site cavity led to the identification of VvROMT L117F/F311W
which did not show any activity towards the four phenolic acids. This avoids undesired O-methylation of
the starting material, which is not desirable since the decarboxylase does not convert the formed pmethoxyphenolic acids. Furthermore, variation of amino acids in the active site led to the identification
of mutants with improved activity for all four phenolic styrenes. The results constitute an important step
towards the synthesis of biomass-derived methoxy styrene derivatives whose photopolymerization
yields polymers with outstanding adhesion properties.

Introduction
The development of innovative, high-performance polymer materials requires monomers with unique
functional groups that can promote their facile and effective polymerization. The use of functional
phenolic styrene derivatives as polymer precursors has gained considerable attention because they can
provide access to novel polymers with varied properties based on their functional groups.[1–5] In addition,
they derive from naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acids 1 and are thus potentially renewable building
blocks for polymers and materials.[6] These acids are natural phenolic compounds that can be found in
almost every plant. High concentrations of p-coumaric (1a), caffeic (1b), ferulic (1c) and sinapic acid
(1d) can be found in berries,[7] coffee,[8] rice bran,[9] and oilseed crops,[10] respectively. While their
concentrations in plants typically range from a few grams per kilogram of source material, they can also
derive from highly abundant natural resources such as lignin, which is the second most abundant natural
resource after cellulose.[11] A prominent example of the current utilization of phenolic acid is the
production of vanillin from ferulic acid.[12] In the last years, biobased hydroxycinnamic acids have been
receiving increasing interest as monomers for the manufacture of polymers. However, the steric
hindrance around the substituted vinyl group is an obstacle to homopolymerization.[6] Even though they
can be copolymerized with less bulky monomers, their content in the produced copolymers is still very
low due to the same reason.[13,14] Condensation polymerization is an alternative but leads to the loss of
hydroxy groups.[15–17] While the direct polymerization of the biobased hydroxycinnamic acids is of limited
efficiency, their decarboxylation gives rise to phenolic styrene derivatives 2.[18–20] Due to the electronrich nature of their double bond, they can undergo polymerization via various mechanisms based on the
functionality of the phenolic styrene derivative.[21–25] The diversity of the different bio-based phenolic
acids allows achieving different properties of the final product in order to meet specific demands. For
instance, 4-vinylphenol (2a) derived from p-coumaric acid is used in polymer chemistry for the
production of photoresists, adhesives and epoxy-curing agents.[26–28] The decarboxylation product of
caffeic acid, 4-vinylcatechol (2b), is a key monomer for adhesive materials inspired by mussel adhesive
protein.[2,29] Unfortunately, the hydroxy group is prone to induce side reactions, complicating the direct
polymerization of these functional styrene derivatives.[30] This complicates their isolation, storage, and
polymerization.[31] Furthermore, achieving controlled polymerization of phenolic styrenes is challenging.
It requires demanding reaction conditions and the use of additives and chain-transfer agents, which limit
their potential for technical application.[23,31,32] The tendency of phenolic styrenes to undergo
spontaneous polymerization and side reactions complicate downstream processing.

Scheme 1: a) Chemical preparation to produce substituted para- or meta-methoxystyrenes 2e-h as protected biobased monomers of methoxy
polystyrenes;[22,33] b) One-pot two-step reaction sequence for the decarboxylation of phenolic acids (1a-d) by phenolic acid decarboxylase from
Bacillus subtilis (BsPAD) and methylation of intermediate hydroxystyrene derivatives (2a-d) catalyzed by resveratrol O-methyltransferase from Vitis
vinifera (VvROMT). S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is provided as a methyl donor and SAH (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine) is produced after the
donation of the methyl group.

In most cases, in situ protection of the phenol group is required to maintain control over the
polymerization while offering a more robust polymerization pathway. This has spurred an interest in the
combination of decarboxylation with reactions for the protection of the phenolic group. Takeshima et al.
reported the facile and scalable one-pot synthesis of bio-based O-protected phenolic styrenes via
chemical decarboxylation of 1 followed by their direct protection via silylation or acetylation.[22] Recently,
Petermeier et al. demonstrated that also enzymatic decarboxylation can be combined with chemical
acetylation.[19] Acetylation and silylation of 2 facilitate controlled radical or anionic polymerization.[6,22,24]
Modification of the functional group can alter the type of the polymerization mechanism and the
properties of the final product. Acetylated or silylated monomers are limited to radical polymerization
mechanisms. In contrast, methoxy styrenes can undergo cationic photopolymerization to yield polymers
with great adhesion properties.[4,5,34] For example, 4-methoxystyrene is used in radical and cationic
polymerizations to produce polymers used in coatings, adhesives, and optical devices.[4,5] 3,4Dimethoxystyrene is also used in polymer chemistry for the preparation of underwater adhesives.[35]
Decarboxylation of phenolic acids at elevated temperatures is energy-consuming and prone to lead to
undesired side-reactivities.[22] Moreover, methylation by methyl iodine is highly problematic from a green
chemistry perspective.[33] In contrast, enzymatic decarboxylation and methylation reactions proceed
under very mild reaction conditions.[36,37] For this, phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis
(BsPAD) has shown high activity and stability.[18–20] As the decarboxylation of 1a-d proceeds in an
aqueous system, enzymatic O-methylation can follow under the same conditions without the
requirement of the isolation and purification of the intermediates 2a-d (Scheme 1). Cofactor-free
phenolic acid decarboxylase employs an electron-relay mechanism comprised of the delocalized

-

electron system and the essential p-hydroxy group on the substrate for the stabilization of the nascent
negative charge upon loss of the carboxylate.[38,39] O-methylation of 1 would disrupt hydrogen bonds

between the p-hydroxy group and two catalytic Tyr residues, preventing decarboxylation of p-methoxy
phenolic acids 1e-h. Therefore, the order methylation-decarboxylation would not work with bacterial
PAD. Decarboxylases accepting methoxy-cinnamic acids have been described but have much lower
activity than BsPAD.[40] For PAD, the order decarboxylation-methylation is therefore preferred (Scheme
1b). In view of a possible simultaneous mode of the cascade, we were interested in an O-methyl
transferase (OMT) that would accept the hydrophobic phenolic styrenes 2a-d as substrates, but not the
hydrophilic acids 1a-d. Plant OMTs are classified into three different types based on the protein
sequence and structures.[41,42] Type I OMTs are cation-independent and active towards hydroxyl
moieties of phenylpropanoids. Type II OMTs are cation-dependent and are mainly involved in the
biosynthesis of lignin. Finally, type-III OMTs are mainly active towards carboxylic acids. For the
methylation of catechol-like compounds type-I OMTs are mainly used such as OMT3 from Sorghum
bicolor (SbOMT3),[43] OMT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtOMT1)[44] and OMT from Vitis vinifera
(VvROMT).[45] The latter stands out with its good activity towards hydroxylated stilbenes. In previous
work, we were able to increase VvROMT mono- and di-methylation activity towards resveratrol by
rational design of its active site.[46] We hypothesized that due to the high hydrophobicity of its active site,
VvROMT would accept the highly hydrophobic phenolic styrenes 2 while showing less activity towards
the polar phenolic acids 1. The selection of VvROMT is further supported by the availability of activesite mutants from Herrara et al.[46] The predicted variants with amino acid substitutions in the
hydrophobic active site cavity were based on molecular modeling and a comparative analysis of binding
site residues. Investigation of a set of 7 variants revealed significant differences in the O-methylation of
resveratrol and pinostilbene, respectively. In lieu of experimentally determined structures and
anticipated difficulties in achieving accurate predictions on the effect of amino acid substitutions on the
activity towards the small, hydrophobic 1a-d, this set appeared to be a very promising basis for the
identification of variants for their conversion.

Results and Discussion
Decarboxylation of coumaric acid 1a, caffeic acid 1b, ferulic acid 1c, and sinapic acid 1d catalyzed by
cell-free extracts of PAD was performed in 500 mg-scale. For the successful decarboxylation of sinapic
acid, the variant BsPAD I85A was employed.[18] This mutant was created analogous to a mutant of
Bacillus pumilus PAD and has increased activity towards p-hydroxycinnamic acids bearing two
substituents in meta-position.[47] With all four phenolic acids investigated, the reactions proceeded
quickly to completion as shown in Scheme 2, and the reaction mixture was immediately used for
experiments on the O-methylation.

Scheme 2: PAD-catalyzed decarboxylation of bio-based hydroxycinnamic acids. Decarboxylation of substrates (10 mM) p-coumaric (1a), caffeic
(1b) and ferulic acid (1c) was initiated by the wild type BsPAD, while sinapic acid (1d) was converted by the cell-free extract of variant PAD I85A
(100mg/mL). Reaction products were identified by GC-MS and verified with HPLC.

To clarify whether VvROMT would also convert the phenolic and catecholic hydroxy groups of the phydroxycinnamic acids 1a-d we then investigated the methylation patter of VvROMT wild-type and a set
of seven variants monitoring the formation of the p-methoxycinnamic acids 1e-h (Scheme 1). The set
included VvROMT wildtype (WT), VvROMT F311W (Mut1), VvROMT L117F/F311W (Mut2), VvROMT
F318Y/A319N (Mut3), VvROMT L117F/F311W/T314L/F318V (Mut4), VvROMT F318R/A319N/F311W
(Mut5), VvROMT L117F (Mut6), and VvROMT L117F/F311L/T314L/F318L (Mut7).
In previous work, some of the variants had moderately higher activity towards resveratrol, and much
higher activity towards the intermediate pinostilbene compared to the wild-type, which resulted in a much
higher overall activity in the two consecutive O-methylations leading from resveratrol to pterostilbene.[46]
As expected, the activity of VvROMT and its variants towards the different p-hydroxycinnamic acids was
very low. In biotransformations of p-coumaric acid 1a and caffeic acid 1b by wild-type VvROMT and the
seven variants, neither substrate consumption nor product formation was observed (Figure 1). For 1b,
this means that neither of the two catecholic hydroxy groups could be methylated.
While wild-type VvROMT did not convert 1c, variants Mut4 and Mut6 showed low activity after 24 h
(Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.). Interestingly, sinapic acid 1d having only
one additional methoxy group was converted with much higher activity than 1c.

Figure 1: O-methylation of the 4-OH group of ferulic acid 1c and sinapic acid 1d by VvROMT and variants. 1a and 1b were not converted. Reaction
conditions: 1 mM phenolic acid, 5 μΜ of the enzyme, 2 mM SAM in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM DTT) at 25oC
and 750 rpm for 24 h. Conversion was determined by HPLC (n=3).

Mut6 exhibited the highest activity and achieved 22% conversion after 24h. In summary, the phenolic acids 1a-d are
generally poorly accepted by VvROMT and its mutants. For each of the phenolic acids, there are variants available with
selectivity for the methylation of 2a-d without undesired conversion of 1a-d. Yet, even the methylation of small amounts of
1a-d will prevent enzymatic decarboxylation, leading to the accumulation of the intermediate 1e-f. Therefore, a sequential
mode of decarboxylation and methylation was chosen as a practical approach mode for the envisioned reaction sequence.

Figure 2: Methylation by VvROMT and its mutants of different phenolic styrenes (2a-2d) obtained from the enzymatic decarboxylation of the
hydroxycinnamic acids is reported. Reaction conditions: 1 mM of styrene derivatives, 5 μΜ of the enzyme, 2 mM SAM in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5
(containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM DTT) at 25oC and 750 rpm for 24h. Values represent an average of 2 replicates. The reaction was monitored
by HPLC (n=3).

The investigation of the O-methylation of para-hydroxy groups of the phenolic styrenes arising from the
enzymatic decarboxylation focused on the effect of the different substituents on the aromatic ring on the
activity of the mutants. Furthermore, we were interested to which extent the variants would be
regioselective towards the two catecholic hydroxy groups of 2b. After the completion of the enzymatic
decarboxylation (Scheme 2), an appropriate volume of this reaction solution with the produced functional
styrene was added to a new vial containing the methylation buffer and the corresponding
methyltransferase without workup or purification of the intermediate. Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte

expected, the activity was higher towards the more hydrophobic phenolic styrenes 2 than toward the
corresponding phenolic acids 1. While 1a was not accepted by any of the variants, 2a was converted,
albeit with relatively low conversions.
The activity of the wild-type and three of the mutants towards 2b was also lower compared to the activity
towards 2c and 2d, showing that the small and relatively polar phenolic styrenes 2a and 2b are poor
substrates for the enzyme. In particular, mutants Mut4, Mut7, and especially Mut3 showed much higher
conversion of 2b, underlining that amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic active-site pocket strongly
influence the activity of VvROMT towards small hydrophobic substrates. Substrate 2b differs from the
others as it offers two hydroxy groups whose methylation requires very different binding poses in the

narrow active site cavity. Interestingly, VvROMT and all investigated variants showed strict selectivity
for the O-methylation of the meta-hydroxy group (Scheme 3). This striking regioselectivity resembles
the selectivity of VvROMT for the meta-hydroxy groups of resveratrol and pinostilbene, respectively,
whereas the para-hydroxy groups of both were not converted.[46] O-methyl transferases are often
regioselective towards catecholic substrates.[37] For instance, isoeugenol O-methyltransferase from
Clarkia breweri was highly regioselective for the methylation of the 3’-OH group of the flavonoids
eriodictyol, luteolin, and quercetin.[36] O-methylation of 2b forms vinyl guaiacol 2c, which is itself a
substrate of the enzyme. This allows direct conversion of caffeic acid via coupled decarboxylation and
the two O-methylation steps directly into para-, meta-dimethoxystyrene 2g.
Overall, 2b, 2c, and 2d were converted by all variants with good activity, achieving conversions up to
90%. Interestingly, the O-methylation of the para-hydroxy groups of the methoxy-substituted substrates
vinyl guaiacol 2c and canolol (4-vinyl syringol) 2d proceeded with much higher activity compared to 2a
and 2b, leading up to 90% conversion. The presence of methoxy groups in 2d and 2c could favor the
stabilization of the substrate in the pocket.

Consideration on substrate acceptance of VvROMT
The three-dimensional structure of VvROMT was previously modeled in a closed, catalytically
competent dimeric conformation, containing the substrate and the co-substrate S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM).[46] The substrate-binding site of VvROMT is composed of hydrophobic residues. Molecular
docking revealed that in the catalytically competent binding mode of resveratrol, the molecule is oriented
with its 3-OH group towards the sulfonium group of SAM. Specific residues such as F24, F167, F311,
and F318 stabilize resveratrol through aromatic interactions, while other hydrophobic interactions
involve L117, M121, M171, W258, and M315. Among these, F311 was identified as a critical residue for
substrate stabilization and catalytic function, as confirmed by both in silico and experimental analyses.
The possible binding of hydroxystyrenes is exemplified by positioning 2d in the VvROMT model (Figure

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8rfjp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2853-3525 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

3a). A structural prediction from AlphaFold 3 revealed differences in the helical region when compared
to the model, shifting active site residues. This highlights the limitations of in silico approaches without
the support of experimental data. After energy minimization, 2d was positioned in the active site of the
model in the para position with the OH group oriented towards the sulfonium group of SAM (3.2 Å
distance) and was also in close proximity to the catalytic H261 (3.5 Å). Interestingly, the predicted
orientation of 2d in the VvROMT binding site was rotated by 60 degrees with respect to the predicted
binding mode of resveratrol, to accommodate for methylation in the para position. The orientation of 2d
resembles that of other type I OMT substrates that are para methylated, such as isoeugenol and sinapyl
alcohol (Clarkia breweri (iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase; PDB codes 3reo, 5cvu), and isoformononetin
(Medicago sativa isoflavone-7-O-methyltransferase 8; PDB code 1fp2).[48] However, our predicted
binding mode of the substrates 2b and 2f with methylation in meta position resembles that of resveratrol
in our VvROMT model, and the meta-methoxy products sinapaldehyde and coniferaldehyde in complex
with Lolium perenne caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (PBD codes 3p9i, 3p9k).[49]
Table 1 summarizes the activity of VvROMT and the seven variants with active site amino acid
substitutions in the conversion of the phenolic acids and phenolic styrenes in comparison to the
conversion of two hydroxystilbenes. In the conversion of 1a-d and 2a-d by VvROMT, two main trends
were observed: VvROMT converts the phenolic styrenes much faster than the phenolic acids 1. Within
the former group of substrates, the activity towards the larger 2c and 2d is higher than towards the
smaller 2a and 2b.

Figure 3: a, Model of VvROMT showing the active site bound to 2d (canolol, green). Residues shown in blue were targeted by directed mutagenesis.
b, binding energy divided into an electrostatic component (Elec) and a van der Waals component (vdW).

The discrimination between 1 and 2 can be attributed to differences in their compatibility with the active
site. The substrate binding site is highly hydrophobic and does provide little polar surface area for the
formation of polar interactions, in particular hydrogen bonds. In the VvROMT structural model, 89% of
the surface area of the substrate binding site buried by resveratrol is hydrophobic, as calculated by the
tool dr_sasa.[50] Analysis of the electrostatic (Elec) and van der Waals (vdW) energy terms of the binding
free energy estimated by the MM-PBSA method in 5 ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed a
positive electrostatic energy for the deprotonated acids 1a-d, while negative Elec values were observed
for all other ligands (Figure 3b). The vdW-energy was negative for all ligands and the total free binding
energy was close to zero for the deprotonated acid and more negative for all other ligands (Figure 3b).

Therefore, interactions with the non-polar styrene group are strongly favored, leading to the observed
discrimination against the polar carboxy group. The capacity of variants Mut1, Mut2, and Mut5 to fully
discriminate between 1 and 2 is significant as it allows the combination of decarboxylation and Omethylation in a one-pot reaction without undesired conversion of the phenolic acids.

Scheme 3: The substrates 2a-d, resveratrol 3a and pinostilbene 3b must be accommodated in different poses in the active site cavity of VvROMT,
depending on the position of the hydroxy group to be methylated (meta/para). The hydroxy groups attacking the reactive methyl group of SAM are
highlighted with an arrow.

The higher activity of VvROMT and its variants towards the larger phenolic styrenes can be attributed
to different reasons. VvROMT wildtype and the seven variants thereof show striking differences in
substrate acceptance (Scheme 3). The effects of the mutations differ between the two stilbenes, the two
larger 2c and 2d and the catecholic 2b. These three groups constitute very different substrates for the
enzyme. Both stilbenes have the methylated hydroxy group in meta-position. While the para-hydroxy
group of 2c and 2d attacks the reactive methyl group of SAM, 2b is methylated first in meta-position.
The double mutant Mut3 is the most active variant in the methylation of 2b, but converts resveratrol and
pinostilbene poorly and has similar activity to the wildtype towards 2c and 2d. Both, 2c and 2d have a
larger hydrophobic surface, which can possibly facilitate the accommodation of the substrate in the
active site. Furthermore, the electron-pushing effect of the methoxy groups on the aromatic ring
increases the nucleophilicity in the attack on the reactive methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).
These two effects appear to be more important than the steric hindrance caused by the additional
methoxy groups. Mut2 introduces two larger aromatic residues into the active site in close proximity to
the phenolic or catecholic ring, and the catalytic H161. The quadruple mutant Mut4 is the most active
towards 2c and 2d and also very active towards 2b. This variant stands out in its relatively high activity
towards 1c and 1d. In contrast, the activity towards resveratrol is lower than that of the wild-type enzyme,
and the activity towards pinostilbene is very low. Mut6 has the single substitution L117F, Mut1 the
substitution F311W, and the double variant Mut2 combines both (L117F/F311W). While Mut6 has the
highest activities towards resveratrol and shows good activity towards the phenolic acids 1c and 1d, it
is neutral towards the phenolic styrenes. The triple variant Mut5 has an arginine in the hydrophobic
active site. This variant has consistently low activity towards all substrates. Without experimentally
determined structural information, accurate explanations of the effect of the amino acid substitutions in
the hydrophobic active site cavity on the O-transmethylation activity are difficult. VvROMT is a dimer,
where amino acids from one monomer contribute to the active site of the other. This constellation makes
accurate predictions of substrate binding and -targeting exceedingly challenging. Our results highlight

the advantages of screening a small but high-quality enzyme library with verified activities. Especially in
the case of enzymes with large, hydrophobic binding sites, precise predictions of enzyme-substrate
interactions are difficult.[51] Estimating the binding free energy with the MM-PBSA method correlated
poorly with our experimental results. The library investigated here contains for each of the four
substrates 2a-d at least one variant with the desired properties for the application in the cascade reaction
shown in Scheme 1. These are the suppression of O-methylation of the phenolic acids 1 and higher
activity towards the intermediate phenolic styrenes 2.
While our results show the feasibility of the enzyme cascade, the supply of the co-substrate SAM is a
limitation. Stoichiometric addition is not economically feasible for the synthesis of monomers. In the last
years, different multi-enzyme cascade reactions have been developed for the regeneration of SAM or
its in situ formation from inexpensive precursors. [52–55] Halide methyltransferases transfer methyl groups
from methyl iodide to SAH [53,56] and their activity could be improved by directed enzyme evolution. [54]
The enzymatic approach has the advantage that the problematic methyl iodide can be applied in small
concentrations. SAM is produced from L-methionine and ATP. This was exploited in a multi-enzyme
cascade of six enzymatic steps that couples regeneration of SAM to enzymatic polyphosphate
degradation. [52] Similarly, the bacterial metabolism can be used to supply SAM in whole-cell
biocatalysts.[56] Recently, the intracellular supply of SAM was improved by betaine as the methyl source
by introducing a betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and coupling it to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(SAH) hydrolysis pathways, underlining the feasibility to supply SAM in whole-cell biocatalysts.[56] The
rapid progress in the regeneration of SAM raises the expectation that the improvements needed for the
synthesis of biobased chemicals can be achieved in the near future.

Conclusion
Preparation and in-situ protection of phenolic styrenes was successfully implemented via a biocatalytic
reaction sequence using phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis followed by the direct
methylation of the intermediates in the presence of resveratrol O-methyltransferase from Vitis vinifera.
The reaction conditions used are much milder than those reported for the chemical decarboxylation and
methylation reactions, respectively. The one-pot two-step reaction avoids workup and purification
problems caused by the instability of the decarboxylation products. Finally, the cascade yields pmethylated functional styrenes which are more stable and are amendable to various cationic
photopolymerizations. Overall, this approach serves as a promising proof of concept, demonstrating
robust efficacy with specific substrates; however, further optimization is required to achieve better
conversion for the less reactive styrenes.

Experimental Section
Materials
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, and all other chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, and Alfa Aesar and were of analytical grade or higher purity and used as received.
The resveratrol O-methyltransferase (ROMT) from Vitis vinifera was kindly provided by Dr. Loreto Parra,
Assistant Professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Bioprocesses of the Pontifical
Catholic University of Chile.
Expression and purification of BsPAD and variant I85A
Synthetic genes encoding the enzymes were purchased from Twist Biosciences (South San Francisco,
USA), transformed, checked for correct insertion by sequencing, and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)
strains.[18] Transformants were inoculated in 5 mL LB medium (1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1%
NaCl) containing 5 µg mL-1 kanamycin and grown at 37 ºC and 130 rpm overnight. The cultures were
used to inoculate 400 mL of TB-Kan medium (40 µg mL-1). The cells were grown at 37 ºC and 130 rpm
until an OD600 of 0.5−0.7 was reached. Expression was started by induction with IPTG (0.1 mM) followed
by incubation at 20 °C and 120 rpm for 20−24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min,
4500 rpm, 4 °C). The resulting pellet was washed with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6 and
stored at −20 °C. The enzymes were purified as described earlier.[18]
Expression and purification of VvROMT and mutants
An E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) culture, containing the pET25-GB1-ROMT vector, was grown in Terrific
Broth (1.2% tryptone, 2.4% yeast extract, 0.3% glycerol, and 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4)
supplemented with kanamycin at 50 μg mL−1. Then, cells were cultivated at 37 ºC at 150 rpm until an
OD600 0.6–0.8 was reached. VvROMT expression was induced by adding IPTG at a final concentration
of 0.5 mM. After 17 h of incubation at 28 ºC and 150 rpm, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000
rpm, 4 ºC for 30 min) and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol,
20 mM imidazole) plus 10 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 U DNAase. Lysis was performed by sonication
for 7 min (7 seg ON 15 seg OFF) on ice, with a Q125 Sonicator (QSonica, Newton, CT, USA). Lysate
was centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 30 min at 4 ºC), and the clarified supernatant was passed through a sterile
0.22 μM MCE membrane BIOFIL syringe filter.
VvROMT purification was carried out through immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), using
a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The clarified extract was loaded onto the column, which was preconditioned
with buffer A, and after 10-bed column washes, the fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) using a four-step imidazole gradient (50, 100, 180, and
250 mM) or a linear gradient. The selected fractions were pooled according to visualization by SDSPAGE or by absorbance at 280 nm. Buffer exchange using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units
(NMWL 30 kDa; Merck Millipore) was performed twice with buffer A, without imidazole. GB1-ROMT

fusion protein was subjected to proteolytic removal of the N-terminal GB1 protein using a His-tagged
TEV protease followed by one-step final purification using IMAC, as mentioned above.
Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) using
bovine serum albumin as a calibration standard. Purification of ROMT variants was conducted in the
same manner. Proteins were used immediately for enzymatic reactions or stored at −80 ºC with 20%
glycerol.
Methylation of phenolic acids

Initially, the reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5) was added followed
by the addition of 2 mM SAM and 5 μΜ of the enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated in a
thermomixer at 25 oC, 750 rpm. The respective substrate (1a-d) in a stock solution of DMSO (200 mM)
was added in the appropriate volume to reach the final substrate concentration of 1 mM. Methylation of
hydroxycinnamic acids was monitored by HPLC. However, confirmation of the methylation products
through HPLC analysis was not possible due to the absence of authentic standards. The appearance
of a second peak other than the peak of the confirmed starting material is assigned to the corresponding
methylation product.
Reaction sequence: Enzyme Activity

Decarboxylation of caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid for the synthesis of 2a-d
was achieved according to the literature.[18] All reactions were performed on a 1 mL scale in 1.5 mL
reaction tubes. The respective substrate pre-dissolved in DMSO (200 mM stock) was mixed with the
reaction buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6), to reach a final concentration of 10 mM. The
reaction was initiated after the addition of the respective amount of the lyophilized enzyme (typically 0.4
mg mL-1) or the CFE of variant I85A (100 mg mL-1) in the case of 2d while incubated at 30 °C with 600
rpm in a Thermomixer. When the full conversion was detected by TLC (cyclohexane/ ethyl acetate= 1/1,
CAM or UV), samples of 150 μL were taken and extracted with MTBE (2×100μL). The combined organic
layers were dried over Na2SO4 and after mixing and centrifugation to allow precipitation of Na2SO4, the
supernatant could be used for GC-MS analysis. For HPLC analysis, samples of 100 μL were taken and
quenched by the addition of 150 μL ACN (containing 400 mM HCl). After centrifugation to allow enzyme
precipitation, the supernatant was used for HPLC measurements. All substrates were fully converted
after 1 h.
The aforementioned reaction solution was used as stock for the methylation reaction. The appropriate
volume of that solution was added to a new vial containing the buffer for the methylation (100 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT) to reach a final substrate concentration of 1 mM followed by
the addition of 5 μΜ of the purified enzyme and 2 mM SAM. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C with
750 rpm in a Thermomixer. The final reaction volume was 150 μL. Samples were taken after 0 and 24
h and an equal volume of acetonitrile (100 mM HCl) was added to quench the reaction. The samples
were centrifuged at full speed for 60 min and then 200 μL supernatant was transferred to microwells
before HPLC analysis. The wavelength chosen for the detection of the methylated products is 305 nm.

The identities of meta-, para- and double-methylated products were confirmed by comparison with
chromatographic elution times of commercial standards.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography

All HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies 1100 Series with an autosampler and
DAD detector together with a reversed-phase Nucleodur C18 Pyramid column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm,
Macherey Nagel). The mobile phase used was acetonitrile/water (0.01% acetic acid) at different
concentrations based on the elution products. All methods and parameters can be found in the
supporting (Table S2). The detection wavelength was 305 nm. Products were confirmed with GC-MS
analysis. All reactions were performed in duplicates.
Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry

GC–MS was used to confirm the formation of the desired product. All measurements were performed
on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 SE instrument equipped with an AOC-20i/s autosampler and injector
unit together with a Zebron ZB-5MSi capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm, Phenomenex). For
GC–MS analyses, the reaction buffer was extracted using the same volume of dichloromethane. Phases
were separated and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. A 1:10 dilution was used for
measurements.
Binding free energy calculations

Ligands were modeled in the substrate binding site of our VvROMT structural model[46] utilizing
resveratrol as a reference. Binding free energy was estimated with the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson
Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method through an automated in-house pipeline inspired by the
webserver farPPI[57] with calculations performed using Amber16’s mm_pbsa.pl script and
AmberTools20.[58,59] The pipeline was setup to prepare the cosubstrate SAM and the ligands using
antechamber and tleap to assign partial charges with the AM1-BCC method and to prepare the protein
with pdb4amber and tleap.[60] A negative charge was assumed for the deprotonated acids 1a-d. The
protein was parameterized with ff19SB[61] and the small molecules with the general Amber force field
(GAFF, version 2.1).[62] The workflow also handled the system setup, solvating it in a periodic truncated
octahedron with and OPC water model, extending at least 10 Å from the solute and neutralizing by
adding sodium ions. PARSE radii were applied. The system was minimized as described by Wang et
al.[57] with a non-bonded interactions cut-off of 9 Å and the particle mesh Ewald algorithm for long-ranged
interactions, followed by heating to 300 K for 500 ps using a Langevin thermostat. Then, the system
underwent density adjustment for 500ps and a 2ns equilibration at constant pressure. Finally, 5 ns of
production simulations were carried out. 250 snapshots were extracted from the trajectory and
processed by mm_pbsa.pl. This procedure was automatically repeated five times for each ligand.
