Abstract
Microplastics – defined as tiny polymer fragments less than 5 mm in size – pose a
clear threat to a wide range of small organisms through ingestion, leading to starvation.
In addition, there are many reports of their occurrence both in remote geographical
areas and in the human body. Small and made of mostly inert materials, they pose a

significant analytical challenge. While primary microplastics i.e., those manufactured
intentionally, have defined characteristics, secondary microplastics resulting from the
degradation of larger plastic debris are much less understood. Cryogenic milling has
emerged as one of the best ways to generate realistic samples with potential for use
as references in studies. Here, we use this technique to generate and study the shapes
and properties of a wide range of consumer plastics, providing an overview of optical
and analytical properties.

Introduction
The development of synthetic plastics derived from petrochemicals over the past two centuries has led to such a significant uplift in living standards that they are now ubiquitous in
the daily life of almost every society. 1,2 They are cheap to produce, sterile and, importantly,
are highly chemically stable, being resistant to oxidation, depolymerization and biodegradation. 3 They have been used to produce pivotal elements in food security, technological
development, research, and medical procedures. 4 This manifests in approximately 400 Mt of
plastic produced worldwide annually. To meet diverse requirements, plastics exist as many
chemically distinct polymers (e.g., polyamides, polyurethanes, rubbers), for which even plastics composed of the same polymer (e.g., polyethylene) can be chemically and materially very
different by their molecular weights, degree of branching, and the inclusion proprietary plasticizers, fillers, or dyes. 5 The huge volumes produced, the wide range of materials used and
– given that only 20% is recycled (either mechanically, chemically or energetically) and the
rest accumulates in landfills or as pollution on land or in rivers and oceans – plastic pollution
is fast-becoming one of the most significant global issues of our time. 6,7
Despite their chemical stability, polymer materials can be mechanically broken down via
abrasive wear, or impact and tensile fractures into ever smaller pieces – microplastics (1 µm
- 5 mm) (MPs) and nanoplastics (1 nm - 1 µm) (NPs). 8,9 Morphologically, MPs come in a
range of shapes and sizes which is determined by their material, original state and their his2

toric breakdown pathways. 10 These smaller pieces disperse more easily within and between
environments, leading to their presence in almost every conceivable environment. 11–14
MPs are now routinely detected in human samples, however, their inherent effects on human
health are still under investigation. 15–17 Nonetheless, they accumulate toxic materials such
as hydrophobic organic pollutants and heavy metals, which then enter the food chain after
ingestion by organisms, especially those in aquatic environments. 18–20 As such, strategies
should be developed to both detect and remove them from the environment and, simultaneously, their influence on animal and human health demands deeper investigation. 21
To better understand the effects of MPs and NPs on their environment and human health,
controllable studies must be performed using standard reference materials. This is problematic for a variety of reasons. Currently, many studies on the environmental and toxic impact
of MPs, as well as strategies to remove or degrade them, use spherical particles synthesized
using well-known colloidal techniques. 22–25 However, the MPs found in nature are neither
chemically pristine, nor morphologically homogeneous, nor monodisperse. The morphology
of MPs is highly relevant to their toxicity due to the increased surface area and capacity to
carry toxic pollutants. 26,27 MPs sampled directly from the environment (e.g., rivers, oceans,
waste-water treatment plants and soils) come from a diversity of unknown sources, being of
unknown age and breakdown history and, as mentioned, are a diversity of chemical makeups. 5 Additionally, they are very dilute and are vastly outnumbered by naturally found solids
such as soils, minerals and biomass. 28–30 Separating them from this mixture is not straightforward or scalable – this is by itself a research problem that would be aided by having access
to reference MPs. Thus, strategies should be developed to produce large numbers of MPs
and NPs which can be used as reference materials in controlled studies. 31
Some examples of methods that produce appropriately polydisperse MP samples are laser
ablation, 32 or micro-abrasion. 33 Whilst these methods provide reliable MPs and NPs with
diverse morphologies, they are more useful for understanding the underlying processes of
MP formation, and less suited for large-scale studies. Von der Esch et al. demonstrate that

hydrolyzation and subsequent sonication of bulk plastics can be used to prepare MPs in large
numbers and with high polydispersity. However, the resulting MP population is highly dependent on the chemistry of the material and the technique is unavailable for certain plastic
types.
Among the most promising strategies for the preparation of reference MPs is cryogenic milling
(cryo-milling), in which bulk plastics are cooled to below their glass transition temperature
(Tg ) before and during milling (oftentimes in a ball mill). 35 The technique is robust across
many materials and has been used for the preparation of both thermoplastic MPs 31,36,37
and elastomeric MPs. 38,39 The resulting MPs are polydisperse and morphologically diverse,
making them suitable as reference materials for naturally found MPs. Additionally, the
technique can be used to mill naturally found plastic waste and, in so doing, more closely
replicate the chemical nature of MPs in a specific local environment. 40
In this work, we prepare MP samples by cryo-milling a diverse range of bulk plastics and
characterize the resulting populations. The plastics are (mostly) sourced from consumer
products to accurately represent the diversity of naturally found plastics. By applying the
same mechanical process to a range of materials, we provide a link between research data
that focuses on narrower groups of material types. We characterize the shape and size distributions of the MPs, and shed light on the pros and cons of the different methods used.
Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting MP samples can be used as reference materials
by spiking road-side material with MP samples.

Sample Selection
Plastic samples were taken from various sources - either found in the lab (e.g. Neoprene
gloves or commercially available Nylon 6 pellets) or office (e.g. HDPE or LDPE carrier
bags), or from consumer products of our daily use (fig. 1A). Included in the samples are the
most prevalent types of plastics found as marine microplastics (PP, PE, PS, PU, PVC, PET,
Nylon). 41,42 Two samples of polyethylene were taken: high- and low- density polyethylene
(HDPE and LDPE, respectively). Despite being chemically similar, they are structurally different which imparts significant differences in their mechanical properties. One of our PET
samples indicated itself as recycled, so we assume the other one to be virgin. We generally
did not distinguish the presence of any fillers, dyes or additives.
All of the plastic samples were cryomilled using the same procedure and milling parameters

in order to compare how their material properties determine the resulting particle size distribution (see experimental procedures). Milling the plastics at −150°C, below their glass
transition temperature, meant that all samples could be processed into powders (fig. 1B)
which showed a broad range of sizes and appearances (fig. 1C).
Since the plastic samples were taken from consumer sources, their exact type was presumed
to be unknown despite accompanying labels (provided for recycling instruction). Many
commercially available plastics are proprietary blends of a polymer with fillers, dyes, and
plasticizers and so to correctly identify the samples, their chemical nature was identified
using two spectroscopic techniques: Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and
Raman microscopy (µ-Raman). Almost all of the samples had clearly identifiable FTIR
spectra, with notable exceptions being Neoprene (polychloroprene) and tire-rubber composite. Although the chemical structure could be adequately described with the aid of prior
knowledge of the materials source, the presence of dyes and fillers produces a range of peaks
that would not be present in pure samples. Particularly for the tire rubber, highly absorptive
fillers such as carbon black dramatically shift the spectrum baseline. 43
To complement the FTIR analysis, Raman microscopy (µ-Raman) was used on all of the
samples to confirm their identification and whether there was any spatial heterogeneity in
their composition, either by the presence of dyes or additives. To investigate this, µ-Raman
spectra were taken from different regions of MPs as well as from different individual MPs.
No significant differences in the spectra were observed within or between particles which
indicates, unsurprisingly, that the plastics are highly homogenized during production.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to gain qualitative information about the
MP size and morphology, being able to resolve the nanometer-scale features and texture of
microplastics. All of the MP samples were highly polydisperse, spanning 3 to 4 orders of
magnitude, and clear differences in the morphology of the microplastics are apparent. The
morphologies can be described as being between two extreme cases of highly tortuous and
deformed, or bulky and ’boulder-like’. SEM is an ideal technique for obtaining this type of

qualitative information, however it is not suitable for obtaining large population data.
To characterize the MP powders quantitatively, the samples were analyzed using a multiscale optical microscopy (OM) method using two magnifications. Wide-field (∼ 4.5 mm ×
4.5 mm) images using stitching and tiling with a 10× objective were used to measure a
statistically significant amount of MPs. A 40× objective was used to get higher resolution
images of the smallest MPs. The data were combined into a single size (equivalent diameter)
distribution to be compared with the LD measurement. OM is a useful technique for size
characterization as a wide range of microscopes, from cheap and simple to sophisticated
high-resolution devices, are available. The shape of the particles can be quantified using
shape factors such as the aspect ratio (AR) and solidity.
Laser diffraction (LD) analysis (MasterSizer-2000, Panalytical) was employed to obtain quantitative size distributions of the MPs. This technique offers high-throughput capabilities,
enabling rapid size distribution measurements of large sample volumes with minimal sample
preparation beyond dispersion. However, limitations arise when analyzing polydisperse and
amorphous MP samples. In polydisperse samples, the overlapping diffraction patterns can
lead to an underestimation of smaller particles due to their weaker scattering signals. While
sample fractionation could improve resolution, it introduces additional steps and equipment
requirements. Moreover, the assumption of sphericity, inherent in LD analysis, neglects particle shape factors, which can introduce inaccuracies in size distribution measurements of
amorphous MPs. Finally, the measurement provided by LD analysis is inherently volumeweighted, being a measure of volume fraction. Thus, the lower volume MP measurements
carry significant errors and can be ’drowned-out’ by the larger volume ones. It is valid to
use volume fraction for the size distributions, however, considering that the most significant
problem regarding microplastics is that they are highly diffusive, a more suitable statistic
is their number fraction distribution, which emphasizes the smallest, most diffuse particle
(all size distributions shown in this work are presented as number fractions). All of these
factors contribute to a significant mismatch between the size distributions measured with

LD and those measured by OM. McColley et al. have demonstrated cryo-milling of consumer
polystyrene to form MPs, and they find a similar result to ours: LD measurements give bias
to the larger particles and under-report smaller size fractions. The SEM imaging of the
samples confirms to us the presence of smaller size fractions, corresponding to ones detected
in OM but that are not detected in LD.
The analytical results for four MP samples which represent some of the most commonly detected MP types, are included in the main manuscript for a deeper discussion: a polyolefin,
LDPE; a polyaromatic, PET; a polyamide, Nylon 6; and an elastomer, Silicone. Further examples are given in the SI and only some of the key similarities and differences are referred
to in the text. Polyolefins (HDPE, LDPE and PP) represent the most commonly produced
plastics worldwide by a considerable margin, with 37.5 % of European plastic production being these 3 species. 44 LDPE alone accounts for 14% of the total European production – being
used primarily for the manufacture of single-use plastic bags, food packaging and bottles –
and is a significant contributor to MP pollution. 45,46 Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is
another of the most widely produced plastics, being used predominantly in the manufacturing of polyester textiles, 47 as well as single-use drinks bottles. 48 As a significant contributor
to MP pollution, many studies are focused on the health and environmental impacts of PET
MPs as well as strategies to remove, recycle or degrade them. 49 The polyamides Nylon 6
and Nylon 6/6 are widely used for their excellent mechanical strength, being used as fishing
lines, packaging, and clothing. As such, they are a commonly found MP in marine environments. 50 Elastomeric materials, such as silicone and rubbers, are not strictly plastics as
their constituent polymers are covalently cross-linked. Nonetheless, micro- and nanoscopic
elastomers are routinely described as MPs and NPs owing to their similarity in number and
effect on an environment. 51,52 As a representative of the elastomeric materials we selected a
silicone elastomer material, obtained by milling a undyed and transparent laboratory bung.
The silicone elastomer MPs were by far the largest particle sizes, with the greatest length,
area and volume average of all samples (fig.1).

LDPE

Figure 2: Characterization of LDPE, including OM and SEM (upper left), FTIR and Raman
Spectroscopy (upper right), and resulting size (lower left) and shape (lower right) distributions.

The polyolefin MPs show distinct shape characteristics which arise due to their engineered
chemical-mechanical properties. LDPE polymers are more branched than their HDPE counterparts, which hinders their crystallization making them more ductile, even below their
Tg . PP can be considered as having properties in between HDPE and LDPE. It is highly
branched, having a methyl group at every monomer unit which allows chains to slide and so
imparts a greater ductility than HDPE. However, the small and highly regular size of this

group compared to the larger, randomly-distributed side chains of LDPE allows it to form
crystalline regions which impart rigidity and brittleness to the material.
The microscopy (SEM and OM) images of the polyolefins all show signs of the MPs being deformed and torn, with frayed edges and a distinct tortuosity in the overall shape of
the particle (fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1, 2). This plastic deformation indicates that the
material was not in a glassy state during breakage. This is more likely for these plastics as
they represent the thermoset plastics with the lowest Tg (∼−110 °C for PE and ∼−20 °C for
PP). Friction between the milling balls and the plastics, as well as between plastics generates
heat which may overcome the cryogenic cooling and heat the plastics above their Tg and
can cause them to be stretched or deformed before fracturing. Plastic stretching, flattening,
and bending of the particles before breakage can result in particles with a pronounced AR
and minimal solidity and, indeed, these features can be seen across the full size range of the
LDPE particles (fig. 2).
The OM data shows that the LDPE sample is particularly polydisperse – quantified by large
differences between each weighted average. The most numerous size range is 1 µm – 2 µm,
with the frequency decreasing approximately inversely with increasing size range. The size
distribution obtained by LD follows the behavior of the microscopy data until the 5 µm
region, after which, it under-reports the smallest particles greatly. This is likely due to the
limitations of LD discussed earlier, with the LDPE sample being highly polydisperse and
asymmetrical.
By comparing LDPE with the other polyolefins, HDPE and PP (Supplementary Fig. 1,
2), it can be seen that the size distributions obtained by both LD and OM are similarly
shaped, but with a slightly lower frequency of the larger size ranges. The HDPE sample has
a narrower distribution of particles with low AR, suggesting ’blockier’, less-stretched particles. Contrarily, the PP sample shows a distinct bimodality in the shapes of the MPs. The
smallest particles are both high AR and low solidity indicating a highly tortuous, ribbon-like
shape, whereas the largest particles are significantly more symmetrical. This may be due to

only microscopic regions of the PP plastics becoming heated above their Tg and producing
small, deformed MPs.

PET

Figure 3: Characterization of PET, including OM and SEM (upper left), FTIR and Raman
Spectroscopy (upper right), and resulting size (lower left) and shape (lower right) distributions.

The SEM images of the cryo-milled PET shows that the particles are blocky but with a
rough surface. Unlike the polyolefin samples they show no signs of having been stretched or
deformed, indicating that all the fracturing events occurred above the Tg (∼ 73 °C).
The size distribution, obtained by OM, shows that the most numerous particle size is the

11

1.5 µm - 2µm range, and there is a significant shoulder located in the 10 µm region. This
bimodality appears in almost all of the MP samples, with a sharp peak in the low, 0.5 µm
- 2 µm range followed by either a shoulder or plateau in the larger size ranges. This could
arise due to distinct underlying breakage mechanisms. For example, a single particle could
be split into two similar magnitude, coarse pieces, with many fine particles being generated
along the crack. Such a mechanism is likely the source of the bimodality in all samples. 53
The shape characterization of the PET sample show narrow distributions of both high solidity
and low AR across all length-scales, supporting the SEM characterization of the particles as
blocky and boulder-like. This indicates that PET is highly brittle during the cryo-milling,
as such particles are generally formed during rapid fracturing events, with minimal-to-no
plastic deformation. Of note, the bimodal breakage mechanism results in particles of similar
form across the two length-scales.
The LD analysis measures matching peak size with OM at ∼1 µm, but under-reports the
larger particle sizes. Interestingly, this under-reporting of the larger sizes by LD analysis
is unique to the PET, recycled PET and PETG samples, as well as PVC (Supplementary
Fig. 3, 4, 5). The OM analysis of the recycled PET shows a size distribution with a similar
character to the virgin PET, but with a broader range and, hence, greater average size (across
all weightings). Morphologically, the SEM shows the particles to be visibly smoother than
the virgin PET, but this is not reflected in the solidity measurements. The recycled PET
sample displays a much broader range of solidity, with many tortuous, frayed particles in
the <10 µm region. PETG is a copolymer of PET and poly(ethylene glycol) which prevents
crystallization of the plastic. This results in a lower modulus which can explain why the
PETG has more frayed, lower solidity particles. The size is slightly larger, but with similar
bimodality – peaks at 1 µm and 10 µm. There is, however, a significantly smaller proportion
of the smaller 1 µm particles compared to the PET sample.

Nylon 6

Figure 4: Characterization of Nylon 6, including OM and SEM (upper left), FTIR and
Raman Spectroscopy (upper right), and resulting size (lower left) and shape (lower right)
distributions.

SEM and OM of the cryo-milled Nylon 6 sample reveals the MPs to have a qualitatively
shard-like shape, with sharp edges and smooth, shear faces. The size distribution obtained by
OM does not display bimodality evident in other samples, instead showing a high frequency
of small particles, with a peak across the 1 µm - 3 µm range, followed by an even distribution
of particles in the 2.5 µm - 100 µm range. The shape characterization distributions show
that the shape factors are consistent across length scales. There is a much broader range
of solidity, but a relatively narrow distribution of AR. This quantifies what is observed of
randomly shaped shards, but no stretching or elongation of the particles.

The size distribution obtained by LD analysis under-reports both the largest and smallest
particles, which is potentially due to the large number of particles across a very broad range,
with no discernible peak above 4 µm. The position of the peak is approximately matching
the OM-obtained distribution (∼ 2µm from LD versus 1 µm - 3 µm for OM).
Interestingly the features of the size distribution are not shared with Nylon 6/6 which has a
much more pronounced peak in the sub-micron range and very low frequencies of particles
in the 10s and 100s of microns range (Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, the Nylon 6/6 shows
a bimodality with a small but distinct peak at ∼200 µm, which is also qualitatively visible
in the OM images. This indicates a slightly different breakage mechanism, which is further
evidenced by the much broader range of solidity measured for the Nylon 6/6 sample.

Silicone

Figure 5: Characterization of Silicone Elastomer, including OM and SEM (upper left), FTIR
and Raman Spectroscopy (upper right), and resulting size (lower left) and shape (lower right)
distributions.

SEM and OM imaging reveals the elastomeric MPs as ’boulder-like’, with sharp corners and
shear but rough faces (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 7, 8, 9). FKM is a notable outlier to this
trend, having a rough and lumpy surface (Supplementary Fig. 10). This likely results from
their different physico-chemical structure to the thermoplastics – they do not have the ability
to plastically deform before breakage, due to the inability of their constituent polymers to
rearrange permanently. The SEM and OM of the silicone sample clearly shows the presence
of MPs that are not accounted for in the LD measurement. This may relate to the much
more pronounced bimodality of the distribution.
15

The polydispersity of the silicone sample is much greater and has a much more pronounced
bimodality than the previously mentioned samples. The vast numerical majority of the
particles are below 3 µm, with very few in the 20 µm – 100 µm range, and then a significant
portion in the 100 µm – 1 mm range. The largest particles have low AR and high solidity
which corresponds to their visual characterization as being boulder-like, with very little
tortuosity. Interestingly, the smallest of the silicone particles provide examples of the largest
AR and lowest solidity particles out of the mentioned samples, suggesting that there are
different breakage mechanisms generating each size population.
The larger, boulder-like particles may break down due to impact fractures below Tg which,
as with the previously described samples, generates high numbers of smaller particles of
similar form. The smaller particles with high AR and low solidity could be the result of a
secondary mechanism, for example wear or abrasion. These are possibly generated above
Tg which is plausible as the heating due to friction will be localized to a thin region at the
surface, from which wear-generated MPs are produced. These heated regions may allow the
formation of rolls and which tear, forming highly tortuous particles, which are measured by
their low solidity. 54
The pronounced bimodality is what likely leads to the significant under-reporting of the
smaller particles by the LD measurement. It can be seen that the LD data does identify a
peak and trough at the same location as the OM measurement, however, it does not measure
any particles smaller than 13 µm, which are evidenced in both SEM and OM.

Rubber in particulate matter from environmental sample

Figure 6: Spiking Environmental Samples. A) Dark-field image of road-side particulate
matter taken. B) Bright-field image of cryo-milled tire rubber composite MPs. C) Dark-field
image of particulate matter, spiked with the cryo-milled MPs (circled). With the knowledge
of (B), identifying MPs in (C) is made much easier.

To demonstrate how such engineered MPs can be used in a research context, we devised a
simple identification experiment using µ-Raman microscopy: Analysing an environmental
roadside sample we anticipated it would contain a detectable amount of MPs. 55 In absence
of a prepared automatic search algorithm, we manually screened the material for traces of µRaman signals of polymers by taking Raman spectra of each particles, but could not identify
any MPs (fig. 6A). This method has been demonstrated previously, but was unsuccessful
here, likely due to the high amount of matrix material, including silicates and bio-material. 56
Thus, we spiked our environmental matrix with a small amount of the tire rubber composite
(fig. 6B and C) and subsequently analyzed both of these samples using µ-Raman. The
cryo-milled tire MPs were easily identifiable in the spiked sample, especially with the aid of
the purely tire particle images and spectra. By collecting Raman spectra from the added
MPs, we could calibrate the illumination to the optimum conditions to identify tire particles.
Furthermore, visual differences between the MPs and the other matter could be observed
and used to identify environmental particles, showcasing that the here prepared materials
and their characterization are likely to become invaluable for different method developments.

Conclusion
Cryo-milling is a suitable technique to generate MP from a broad range of polymeric materials through impact applied below the glass temperature. Here, we tested a selection of
some of the most common plastics and polymers, mostly obtained from consumer products.
We analyze the individual properties of the resulting materials using optical microscopy and
subsequently we use complementary techniques to confirm our findings. While most ’naturally’ formed microplastics are generated at temperatures similar to room temperature,
further investigations and comparisons with existing models are required to understand any
discrepancy between the resulting size and shape distributions of cryo-milled and naturally
formed MPs. We briefly demonstrated the utilization of the obtained materials in an exemplary method development process: a broad range of particulate matter is present in
an environmental sample, but the µ-Raman analysis does not allow for conclusive results
(partly due to the unspecific rubber signal). Spiking with a known sample allows for optimization of measurement conditions and paves the way for streamlined MP identification
and quantification.

Methods and Materials
Selection of Materials
All plastic samples were obtained from various everyday sources, primarily including laboratory products (such as gloves, septum stoppers, Falcon tubes, and lab-grade plastic pellets)
and consumer materials (such as carrier bags, slushy cups, and 3D printing filaments). For a
comprehensive analysis of the results, we further categorized these plastics into four distinct
cases, each represented by an example. These cases reflect some of the most commonly
detected plastic and microplastic types in wastewater.

• Silicone, an elastomer, was obtained from the septum stopper of a laboratory roundbottom flask.
All these materials were used directly without any chemical modification; however, they
were mechanically cut into chunks before undergoing the described cryo-milling procedure.

Preparation of Microplastics
Initially, techniques including room temperature (20°C) ball milling, grinding, or tear were
tested on the different polymers due to the ease of availability. However, these were unsuitable for producing powders of micro-particles for almost all of the samples. Instead of
fracturing, many plastic samples would deform plastically. 0.5 g to 2 g of the plastics were
cut into approximately 5-millimeter pieces, where necessary. These samples were then placed
into standard grinding vials and loaded into the cylindrical chamber of a cryogenic freezer
mill (6775 Freezer mill from Spex SamplePrep). Liquid nitrogen was introduced into the
chamber, pre-cooling the plastics to −150°C for 20 minutes. Subsequently, the materials
underwent three grinding cycles, each lasting 2 minutes, with 2 minutes of inter-cooling time
between cycles. The grinding speed of the mill was maintained at 12 cycles per second.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR was performed on each sample by depositing ∼2 mg of MP powder onto the window
of Nicolet iS5 FT-IR Spectrometer equipped with a Thermo Scientific iD5 single-bounce
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory featuring a diamond crystal with a ZnSe lens.
Spectral data were collected over a range of 4000 cm-1 to 500 cm-1 and were processed
(baseline correction and smoothing) using MestreNova.

Raman Microscopy
Raman spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments RM5 Confocal Raman Microscope equipped with 532 nm and 785 nm lasers and a back-illuminated charge-coupled device
detector. The samples were prepared by depositing ∼10 mg of dry MPs onto stainless steel
slides and were viewed with episcopic illumination in dark-field mode. The µ-Raman was
aimed at separate regions of individual MPs, as well as at different MPs, and spectra were
taken over a range of time-scales and intensities until clear signals could be obtained. The
spectra were processed (baseline correction and smoothing) using Edinburgh Instruments
Ramacle software, as well as MestreNova.

Laser Diffraction
A MasterSizer-2000 (Malvern Panalytical) was used for LD analysis. The system was washed
3 times with EtOH before taking a background measurement of EtOH flow. MP powder
was then added to the system until the laser obscuration was in the 10% - 20% range.
Measurements were taken for 30s with a 30s wait time in between. 3 measurements were
taken for each sample and the average of these was used for analysis.

Dispersion of MPs
Approximately 50 mg of the MP powders were dispersed in 1.5 mL of absolute ethanol and
vortexed for 1 min to disrupt any particle agglomeration. 100 µL micropipette tips were cut
at the end to create a wider opening (∼ 2.5 mm) to allow the passage of larger MPs. The tips
were then rinsed with absolute ethanol (EtOH) to remove any MPs that may be generated
during the cutting. The use of plastic materials, such as the pipette tips, should be avoided
in all MP research, however, due to the large quantities of the MP powders produced and
analyzed in this work, we consider them to produce only statistically insignificant numbers of
new MPs. Glass slides were cleaned by compressed air and set-down at a tilted angle (10 °)

from the surface. The MP suspension was agitated using the micropipette with the widened
tips before 25 µL of the suspension was collected and deposited at once on the raised end
of the glass slide. The droplet would then extend down the slide, dispersing the MPs as
it extended before drying. The resulting dispersion had the faster-sedimenting, larger MPs
concentrated on the raised end of slide, with smaller MPs concentrated on the lowered end.
This allowed for proper visualization of the smallest particles which would be obscured by
the largest particles. For imaging in SEM, a similar process of deposition was used, with 2
µL of suspension deposited on an SEM mount.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM images of the micro plastic samples were taken using a ZEISS Gemini SEM 300 using
the SE detector. Samples were prepared by drop-casting 2 µL of MP suspension in EtOH
on aluminum tape coated sample holders. After complete drying of the EtOH, the sample
was sputtered with a thin film of Gold Palladium 80:20 to increase the conductivity.

Optical Microscopy
The MP dispersions, dry mounted between a glass slide and a cover slip, were placed cover
slip down in the automated stage of an Nikon Ti-2 microscope and images were captured
with a Photometrics Prime BSI camera. A 10×/ 0.45 NA (Plan Apo, Nikon) was used. A
field of view at the top-left of the cover slip served as the set point for the acquisition of the
first image. The automated stage was then used to take 64 images in an 8×8 grid (∼ 4.5
mm × 4.5 mm). The software then digitally stitched the images to form a single, wide-field,
composite image. After saving the image, the stage was manually moved ∼1 cm to the right
of and/or below the previous region of interest. This process was repeated 9 times so that
the dispersion was imaged in 2 rows of 5 composite images, spanning the length and breadth
of the MP dispersion. After saving the images, the objective was switched to a 40×/0.75
NA (Plan Apo, Nikon), and the process was repeated. The composite images under 40×

magnification were ∼1.1 mm × 1.1 mm, and were attempted to be taken within the regions
of the 10× composite regions (Supplementary Information 2).

Image Processing
Images taken from the optical microscope were processed using ImageJ. 57 The gray-scale
images were de-speckled and filtered with a 1.5 pixel Gaussian blur to remove unwanted
noise artifacts. The images were then binarized by auto-thresholding. The particle Area,
solidity, Aspect Ratio and Feret min and max diameters were measured using the Analyze
Particles function (16px2 to infinity). For amorphous particles, the AR is a measure of the
overall symmetry of a particle and solidity is a measure of empty space within the particles
external volume (Supplementary Information 3). The measured area was used to calculate
an equivalent diameter. The collected data was processed and plotted using Python software
(numpy, matplotlib, pandas). For the scatter plots, a 2D kernel density estimation (seaborn)
was used to better visualize the density of data points.
To combine the 10× and 40× measurements into a single histogram, a range of particle sizes
was selected (5 µm - 50 µm) that both magnifications can easily detect in good numbers.
The scaling factor of the particle counts between the two data-sets was measured within
this range, and then applied to the whole of one data-set. Finally, the average between the
unscaled and re-scaled datasets was used. A more detailed explanation and visualization is
provided in Supplementary Information 4.

Roadside Sampling
A sample of roadside particulate matter was taken from an inner-city road of Glasgow, UK.
The material was collected in November with significant amounts of dead foliage by the road.
A cotton swab was used to collect matter by rolling it alongside the gutter of the road. The
swab was then deposited in a glass vial containing 2 mL of DI water and sonicated (Vevor
Digital Ultrasonic Cleaner) for 5 minutes to release the particulates.

SI 2) Dispersion of Samples
Supplementary Fig. 16 shows how the MPs were dispersed on glass cover slips before imaging
in OM. The approximate measurement regions are overlaid. The 40× region is notably
smaller than the 10× region, requiring the data to be re-scaled before combination.

SI 3) Thresholding of Images and Shape Factors
Images were processed in ImageJ and converted to binary masks (Supplementary Fig. 17(i
- iii)). The Solidity of the particles was measured by constructing a convex hull around the
perimeter of the particles. The Solidity is then calculated as the fraction of the area of the
particle within the convex hull area (Supplementary Fig. 17(iv)). The Aspect Ratio of the
particles was calculated by fitting an ellipse to the particle (least-squares method provided
by ImageJ). The Aspect Ratio is then calculated as the ratio of lengths of the principle axes
of this ellipse (L/W in Supplementary Fig. 17(v)).

SI 4) Optical Microscopy Data Combination
To combine the two particle size distribution datasets, obtained from 10× and 40× magnification OM, the 40× dataset was re-scaled to. A size range that could be easily detected
with both magnifications of 5 µm to 50 µm was chosen. A 20 bin histogram was generated
for both magnifications within this overlapping region, and an average scaling factor was
calculated comparing the height of each bin. This scaling factor was applied to the counts
for each bin of the full range of the 40× dataset, essentially synthesizing particles that would
be counted if the 40× data covered an equivalent area as the 10× data. To finally combine
the two datasets, the average of the counts of the 10× and the synthesized 40× bins was
calculated and this value was used as the final counts. If one of the two had a value of 0,
the non-zero value is used in the final combined distribution.
