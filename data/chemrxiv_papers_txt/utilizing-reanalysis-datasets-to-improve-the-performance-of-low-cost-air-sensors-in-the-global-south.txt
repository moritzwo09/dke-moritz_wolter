A Low-cost sensors for particulate matter can provide high spatiotemporal resolution monitoring of air quality, especially in
much of the Global South, and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in particular, where reference-grade instrumentation is often not
available. However, ensuring high-quality data from low-cost sensor (LCS) platforms is essential. Until now, LCS required
calibration by collocation with a reference-grade monitor to be used for more than qualitative studies of air quality, but
reference-grade monitors are not available in many countries of the Global South. Since a key artifact in optical PM sensors
is aerosol hygroscopic growth, we explore the viability of an alternative LCS calibration method: a hygroscopic growth
correction factor using particle composition data from the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset. We compare 3 different LCS located
in 3 different areas of SSA – Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa - with 3 different calibration techniques: traditional linear
calibrations with a reference-grade monitor, a κ-Köhler-derived correction with MERRA-2 data, and a random forest machine
learning regression utilizing MERRA-2 and the regulatory-grade monitor. Random forest regressions using MERRA-2 particle
composition data and collocation with a reference-grade monitor improve sensor performance to near that of regulatorygrade monitors. But even without collocation, a hygroscopic growth correction based on MERRA-2 particle composition
alone can improve LCS PM2.5 performance by reducing mean-normalized bias to near-zero and reducing error by up to 40%.

Introduction
Poor air quality is one of the leading causes of premature
mortality across the globe. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the
problem of poor air quality is especially acute and is not only
linked to high morbidity and mortality but also to billions of
dollars of lost economic output.1,2 Addressing the issue of poor
air quality, however, first requires that pollution concentrations
are measured. In much of SSA, regulatory-grade, high-fidelity
monitoring of air pollution is not widely available (if at all),
generally due to the price of such monitors (on the order of USD
40,000 after duties and taxes), which creates a barrier for policy
and decision-makers to take action against air quality issues. 3

Low-cost sensors (LCS), with costs on the order of USD 10-1000,
offer an attractive alternative to high fidelity monitoring (i.e.
regulatory- or research-grade monitors) due to their low(er)
initial and maintenance costs and ease of deployment.
Unfortunately, out-of-the-box performance of LCS is generally
low and unsuitable for anything more than qualitative
assessments of air quality, especially when deploying LCS in
areas very different from factory-calibration conditions, i.e. the
Global South in general and SSA in particular. 4 Out-of-the-box
performance can, however, be corrected to near-regulatory
grade measurements and much work has been done on the
subject.5
A common and effective method to correct LCS PM2.5
performance is through collocations with regulatory- or
research-grade
instruments
(hereafter
“reference
instruments”) in proximately the same area where the sensors
are to be deployed. Collocation-based corrections empirically
account for the varied factors that affect LCS performance, such
as usual mass loadings, size distributions, particle shape,
particle composition, source mixtures, and ambient
temperature and humidity ranges.e.g. 6–8 These methods,
whether they use simpler linear regression methods or more
complex machine learning tools, however, necessitate the
presence of a reference instrument. In much of SSA, access to
such instrumentation is simply unavailable or inaccessible, so
alternative methods to ensure higher-accuracy data from LCS
are needed. Fully theoretical approaches to LCS calibration have
recently been developed utilizing Mie Theory but these

approaches can be computationally expensive, fairly opaque to
all but the most advanced of users, and require a priori
knowledge of the aerosols being measured by the LCS. 9,10 A
different approach is to use semi-empirical relationships, such
as κ-Köhler theory.11 This approach still requires some a priori
knowledge of aerosol size distribution and composition but is
much less computationally expensive and much more
transparent to lay-users. Previous work has already
demonstrated that by using κ-Köhler theory LCS accuracy can
be improved to within 33% of reference instruments and can
result in lower mean absolute errors.12–14 However, information
about aerosol hygroscopicity, which depends on aerosol size
distribution and chemical composition, is still needed. Aerosol
chemical composition is generally measured with filters or
aerosol mass spectrometers, but collecting such data can be
logistically complicated and difficult, especially on an ongoing
basis and at high time resolution (~hourly), which usually
requires the use of aerosol mass spectrometers.
To overcome the need for reference monitors and
measured aerosol composition, we build upon, first, recent
work showing that most cheap particle sensors (e.g Plantower,
Sensirion, etc.) are relatively insensitive to aerosol size
distribution15 and, second, the finding by Malings et al. (2020)
that the hygroscopic correction factor (as applicable to LCS) is
not particularly sensitive to the exact aerosol composition; an
approximation of the regional composition may be sufficient
(this latter finding may well be a result of the former). A
relatively new, freely available source of spatially-resolved
global aerosol composition is NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective
analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis
data set, obtained from satellite observations combined global
chemistry transport modelling. In this paper, we evaluate how
MERRA-2 PM2.5 composition outputs can be used with κ-Köhler
theory to generate correction factors for LCS deployed in SSA.
We performed this analysis at sites in East Africa, West Africa,
and South Africa, where reference-grade instruments were
available for verification. While typical correction models are
built on linear regressions, the complexity of aerosol
hygroscopic behavior may not be captured well by linear
parametric relationships. Hence, we also examine how machine
learning algorithms can be applied to the combined MERRA-2
and LCS data to improve LCS performance in data-sparse
regions.

Experiment
Sites, Instrumentation, and Data Availability
This paper covers data from three deployments of LCS
collocated with reference instruments from AfriqAir
(www.afriqair.org) and AfriqAir partners across sub-Saharan
Africa. The first set of instruments includes 2 Real-time,
Affordable, Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) monitors deployed with
attached PurpleAir PA-II (Plantower PMS5003) units and a Met
One Beta Attenuation Monitor (BAM-1020). These instruments
were deployed at the Theha Setjhaba Primary School

(26°51'09.5"S 27°51'23.0"E) in Zamdela, South Africa. Zamdela
is a semi-urban informal settlement approximately 80km SSW
of Johannesburg with approximately 90000 residents. Major
PM2.5 sources include vehicles and combustion from residential
cooking, heating, and waste disposal. The RAMPs were
deployed from November 2019 to April 2021. In this study, we
focus on data from November 2019 to April 2020 due to
instrument maintenance issues caused by COVID-19 lockdowns.
We use an average of the (cf = atm) A and B PM2.5 channels from
the Plantower sensors, provided they are within 10% of each
other (data are not included if this check is not passed).
The second set of instruments covered here are 5 Clarity
Node-S monitors (with internal Plantower PMS 6003 sensors for
PM measurements) deployed with another Met One BAM 1020
at the University of Nairobi (UoN; 1°16'44.2"S 36°49'02.9"E)
from February 2021 to June 2021. The UoN campus is located in
central Nairobi and previous work has shown that mineral dust
and traffic are the dominant PM2.5 sources though other
combustion and industrial and “mixed” sources are also
important.(Gaita et al., 2014) Data from the Clarity nodes were
downloaded from the Clarity API. We use the “Raw PM2.5 Mass
Concentration”
(pm2_5ConcMass.raw)
data.
PM 2.5
concentrations of less than 1 μg/m3 were removed from the
dataset but no other filtering of the data was necessary.
The final set of instruments used in this study was a QuantAQ Modulair-PM unit deployed with a US Dept. of State MetOne BAM-1020 at the US Embassy in Accra, Ghana (5°34'46.2"N
0°10'14.6"W). We use data from July 2021 to January 2022. The
Modulair-PM uses two light scattering-based particle sensors
(Plantower PMS5003 and Alphasense OPC-N3) to measure PM1,
PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations and size distributions. Here we
use the PM2.5 output of the instrument on which Quant-AQ
applies a calibration incorporating assumptions of chemical
composition. The Modulair-PM calibration utilizes the dual
optical sensor outputs along with size-dependent
hygroscopicity (κ) and density (ρ) assumptions to calibrate the
output data.(Hagan and Cross, 2022) In Accra, the κ and ρ values
were taken from the instrument data portals and range from
0.02 < κ < 0.3 and 1.65 < ρ < 2.5.
MERRA-2
MERRA-2 is an atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite
era produced by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation
Office (GMAO), utilizing satellite observations combined with
the Goddard Earth Observing System model.(Gelaro et al.,
2017) We utilize the Modern Era Retrospective analysis for
Research and Applications Aerosol Reanalysis (MERRAero)
reanalysis which simulates, through the Goddard Chemistry,
Aerosol, Radiation, and Transport aerosol module, the surface
concentrations of five types of aerosols: dust (PM 2.5 segregated;
DUST2.5), sea salt (PM2.5 segregated; SS2.5), black carbon (BC),
organic carbon (OC) and sulfate (SO4). These are treated as noninteracting external mixtures and are derived from surface
wind-speeds (dust and sea salt) and standard emissions
inventories such as EDGAR 4.2.(Buchard et al., 2016) MERRA-2

Correction Models
Three different methods of calibrating the LCS are presented
here: multilinear regressions, composition dependent
hygroscopicity corrections, and a machine learning random
forest regression. These three methods are respectively the
“traditional” (and simplest) method, a novel application of a
semi-empirical method, and a novel application of machine
learning algorithms for LCS calibration. The linear calibrations
all follow the same form:
𝑃𝑀2.5,𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 𝛼𝑃𝑀2.5,𝐿𝐶𝑆 + 𝛽𝑅𝐻𝐿𝐶𝑆 + 𝛾 (1)
where PM2.5, cal is the calibrated PM2.5 from the LCS (the PM2.5
measurements from the collocated reference instrument when
calculating the regression coefficients), RHLCS is the relative
humidity measurement from the LCS, and α, β, and γ are
regression coefficients solved by a multilinear regression
implemented in Python. As noted in Giordano et al.(Giordano et
al., 2021), temperature measurements (from the LCS or
external) are generally not necessary for many LCS collocations.
This was confirmed for the collocations presented here by
including a temperature term in Eq. 1 which resulted in
standard errors on the temperature coefficients showing that
the terms are not statistically significant in this case.
The semi-empirical hygroscopic correction applied here are
described in detail in Malings et al.13. In short, the LCS
measurements are corrected such that:

salt, and organic carbon in PM2.5 from MERRA-2 where the total
mass of PM2.5 from MERRA-2 is calculated using the five aerosol
types as described in Buchard et al.16
The Random Forest (RF) regression is a machine learning
algorithm that predicts regression values from new input data
by constructing an ensemble of decision trees using a training
data set.17 Here we construct and train the RF using the PM 2.5,
RH, and T measurements from the LCS along with the 5 aerosol

implementation of the RF regression is implemented with the
Scikit-learn library.18 The default settings for the
RandomForestRegressor are used with the exceptions of
increasing the number of trees to 1000 due to the density of the
measurements used here and setting random_state = 42 for
reproducibility. The number of trees can significantly impact the
performance of the regressor but tests of 100, 250, 500, 750,
1000, 2000, and 5000 trees indicate that 1000 is a good
compromise between performance and computation time for
these datasets. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to help
mitigate a risk of over fitting as well.
Performance Metrics
Here we focus on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), meannormalized bias (MNB), mean absolute error (MAE), and
coefficient of variation in the mean absolute error (CvMAE). All
are described in detail in Malings et al.13. The metrics presented
in the main text well capture the accuracy and precision of the
calibration methods though additional metrics are presented in
the Supplementary Information.

PM2.5 Concentrations
Figure 1 shows a representative subset of the PM 2.5 data
measured by both the reference instruments and the LCS
(uncorrected data) from each of the three measurement
locations.
Over the entire collocation period in Accra, Ghana (195 days)
PM2.5 concentrations (from the BAM; hourly measurements)
range from 5-192 μg/m3 with an average of 31.7 μg/m3. If the
Harmattan dust event in Dec. 2021 (confirmed as a dust event
from on-the-ground observers) is excluded from averaging it
will be 24.3 μg/m3. In Nairobi, Kenya, the range is not as
extreme as Accra but still large at 2-98 μg/m3 and a mean of
19.9 μg/m3 (from the BAM). Zamdela, South Africa is similar to
Nairobi with a range of 1-79 μg/m3 and an average of 17.3
μg/m3. Figure 1 emphasizes an important fact about PM 2.5
measurements in Africa: the range and average values are
generally much greater than those measured in the Global
North, irrespective of the sampling heights from ground level.
This, combined with the fact that the PM sources are also very
different between the Global North and Africa, means that
applying calibrations made outside the specific deployment
location in Africa (since PM sources differ between E, W, and S
Africa) will generally yield poor results (see SI Figure S1).
The overall performance of MERRA-2 in terms of surface-level
PM2.5 mass estimates is also important to note. Figure 2 shows
the PM2.5 concentrations measured from the 3 reference
monitors compared to the overall PM2.5 mass estimated by
MERRA-2, calculated as in Buchard et al.16 Included in the figure

loadings in Accra in the dry seasons by at least 50% and under
predicts in the rainy seasons by the same (CvMAE = 0.64 and
0.5, respectively; see Table S1).
MERRA-2-derived PM2.5 Composition
As previously discussed, LCS are sensitive to aerosol
physiochemical characteristics, especially aerosol composition
and size. As most countries in the Global South, and Africa
especially, have little or no direct composition measurements,
we must turn to other tools to obtain composition estimates.
Figure 2 shows the average composition for the three
measurement locations obtained from MERRA-2, segregated
into dry and rainy seasons for Nairobi and Accra (where rainy
seasons are March-May and October-November for Nairobi,

(noted as a black box) and a simple linear best-fit regression for
all 3 locations. Overall, the agreement between estimated and
measured concentrations is quite poor for both Zamdela, South
Africa and Nairobi, Kenya with R2 correlation values <0.1. If the
data is segmented into winter/summer and rainy/dry periods,
respectively, neither location shows improved agreement
between measured and estimated PM2.5. In Accra, Ghana, the
apparent agreement between the reference monitor and
MERRA-2 is quite high, with a R2 correlation of 0.61. However,
if the Harmattan period is removed from the data, R 2 falls to
0.01 (see SI figure S2). As shown in the next section, MERRA-2
agrees with intuition and attributes most of the PM loading in
the dry season to dust but, in general, over predicts overall PM

and March-July Sep.-Nov. for Accra) and winter/summer in the
case of South Africa.
For the most part, these MERRA-2 aerosol composition
predictions make sense for both Nairobi and Zamdela. Given the
proximity of the measurement sites to anthropogenic PM
sources (industry, vehicles, biomass burning), OC making up the
largest fraction in each site and season is reasonable and agrees
with previous literature.19,20 The high sulfate loadings in
Zamdela generally agree with the work of Muyemeki et al
(2021) which showed high year-round loadings with higher
loadings present in the summer months. The MERRA-2 results
also generally agree with Muyameki et al.(2021) results for dust

and sea salt. In Nairobi, dust making up about a quarter of the
total PM2.5 loading in both the rainy and dry seasons is in
general agreement with the work of Gaita et al. 21. Gaita et al.
did show, however, that there are large seasonal differences
even between the short and long rainy periods for mineral dust
concentrations which do not appear to be captured in MERRA2 (see SI Figure S3). For black carbon and sea salt, not enough
work has been done in Nairobi to determine if either the overall
loadings and/or their temporal distribution are correct, but the
results from MERRA-2 seem reasonable.
The largest question mark is, however, in Accra where dust
constitutes the most abundant species in both the rainy and dry
seasons. Accra does suffer from high dust outflows from the
Sahara due to the Harmattan winds caused by seasonal changes
in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, but this generally only
occurs in December and January.
MERRA-2 calculates
extremely high dust loadings, showing a sinusoidal pattern with
elongated peaks that top out at over 80% of the total PM2.5, for
most of the year except from May to September where the
contribution drops to near 0 (see SI Figure S4). Even examining
the overall PM2.5 loadings, MERRA-2, does not seem to perform
well over Accra. The reanalysis simply has high overall loadings
from approximately September to March and completely
misses the March-May rainy season and the short summer dry
season (see SI Figure S5 or US Embassy BAM-1020 data from
airnow.gov). Therefore, this dry and wet demarcation of the
MERRA-2 data for Accra is not applicable. Due to the lack of
recent speciation measurements, it is unclear if the BC, OC, SO 4,
and sea salt estimated contributions are realistic but it can be
said that the dust contributions are unrealistic with the
exception of the Harmattan months.
It is important to remember that we use MERRA-2 because it
seems to be the best estimates for aerosol composition that we
have available. It is also important to remember that this usage
of MERRA-2 may not be ideal due to both the emissions
inventories that MERRA-2 uses and the fact that a nominal ~50
km horizontal spatial resolution may not well capture the urban
emissions setting that the Accra monitor is in. Still, using these
estimates could be a good starting point to develop calibration
models for low-cost sensors. More work can and should be
done comparing MERRA-2 data for more sites in West Africa
specifically.

Low-cost sensor calibrations
In total, there are 4 data streams from the low-cost sensors that
need to be examined: raw (uncalibrated/uncorrected) data,
corrected data using collocation-based linear corrections,
corrected data using the aerosol hygroscopicity f(RH,T,κ) linear
correction, and corrected data using the aerosol compositionbased random forest calibration. Note that the first and third
corrections, the linear model and random forest, require the
presence of a reference monitor while the f(RH,T,κ) correction
as implemented here does not. Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the
four LCS data streams for Accra, Nairobi, and Zamdela,
respectively, plotted against the reference monitor PM 2.5 data
for those locations. These figures should be viewed in

Accra, however, the performance of the f(RH) model is 25-50%
worse than simply using the raw data. The performance of the
f(RH) model even slightly degrades if separate models are made
for the dry and rainy seasons. Given MERRA-2’s dust-dominated
composition estimates over Accra for the entirety of the year,
however, poor performance of a correction model driven
entirely by the composition estimates is not unexpected (e.g.
see SI Figure S4). Pointing out an exact reason for the poor
performance is not possible with the data available but the
same analysis centering around bulk κ may yield some insights.
For the time period of this study, bulk κ averages around 0.4 for
July-September, 0.2 for September and October, increases from
0.1 to 0.2 in November, and sharply decreases to less than 0.1
for December and January (SI Figure S6). This appears to be
driven completely by the dust component although a full
analysis of the input emissions inventories and regional
emissions estimates that go into MERRA-2 would have to be
performed to say for certain, which is well beyond the scope of
this manuscript. It is also unclear whether this issue would
affect all desert and desert-adjacent regions in Africa or if the
Gulf of Guinea, or simply Accra itself, is uniquely affected. Other
public data products that provide aerosol composition (e.g.
GEOS-CF) may be useful where MERRA-2 is currently falling
short but more work is needed to confirm this. Regardless of the
reason for the poor performance of this model in Accra,
however, it can be said that this methodology for creating a
reference instrument-independent correction model shows
promise for much of Africa and likely over the Global South as a
whole - as long as MERRA-2 is approximately correct for bulk κ.
The random forest correction model represents the
combination of both reference instrumentation and MERRA-2
composition estimates. The former provides overall mass
corrections for the LCS whereas the latter refines and helps
correct systemic biases inherent in the optical sensing used in
LCS PM2.5 sensors. Overall, the RF models perform extremely
well. In all 3 study locations, bias is reduced to near-zero, error
metrics are significantly reduced (50-80%), and even
correlations are improved (although Accra remains an
exception on this last point for the reasons discussed above).
The tail that can be seen in Figure 3 on the RF correction is
indeed the Harmattan dust event noted in Figure 1. This agrees
with previous experience with random forest models for lowcost sensors that these calibrations can perform poorly at the
upper extremes of the data ranges.24 Forcing a correction on
this data during model development could be possible but may
also lead to over-constraining the model. Other techniques such
as layering correction models (both machine learning and
“simpler” methods) may improve performance but in this case
it is difficult to disambiguate the effects of the manufacturerimplemented calibration for the Accra sensors (which includes
hygroscopicity and density and therefore is an aerosol
composition surrogate) and the MERRA-2 composition
estimates. In summary, although this technique of combining
machine learning and reanalysis data does yield excellent
results, the caveats should not be ignored. Not only does this
method require a reference instrument in the same way that

ARTICLE
the linear correction models do, but it also requires some
expertise in both machine learning and utilizing reanalysis
datasets. Combined with the fact that reference
instrumentation is unavailable in much of the Global South; the
machine learning techniques are easy to over-constrain; and
the reanalysis sets have not been verified over much of the
Global South; it is difficult to recommend this technique for
general use before much more verification and validation has
been done.

Conclusions
Overall, the results presented here show that utilizing reanalysis
datasets to correct for aerosol composition effects can improve
the performance of low-cost sensors in the Global South.. Even
though the reanalysis dataset is not suitable for use in
predicting overall PM loadings, the aerosol composition
estimates lead to improved low-cost sensor performance over
three very different areas in Africa when reference instruments
are not available, and even more so if reference instruments are
available. If we can better understand and potentially correct
for the apparent overestimation of dust in Accra (and similar
cities) by MERRA-2, we could significantly improve the usability
of LCS in all regions where no reference instruments are
available. Even now, the implications here for air quality
monitoring across the Global South are very promising.
Reanalysis datasets such as MERRA-2 are freely available and
we show that correction methods based on these data (and
established aerosol science) can be used to improve the
performance of popular cheap PM sensors. Random forest
regression using collocation and MERRA-2 aerosol composition
can further significantly improve LCS performance.
Unfortunately, this method and classical collocation-based
linear regression require access to expensive and often
unavailable/inaccessible reference instruments. In places
where that access is limited, we show that using just the aerosol
composition from MERRA-2 can be used to make real gains in
LCS data quality by correcting for aerosol hygroscopicity which
is a known artifact with light scattering-based PM sensors.
However, there is a major potential hurdle in this methodology:
the accuracy of MERRA-2. MERRA-2 does seem to capture the
Harmattan in Accra, Ghana but outside of the known Harmattan
season, the composition data are questionable. Additionally,
the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset is only available 20 days after
each month. For real-time air quality monitoring (which could
improve forecasting and aid in proactive air quality controls),
we could explore the corresponding monthly composition from
previous years given the relative insensitivity of LCS hygroscopic
corrections to exact aerosol composition. Improving the
performance of MERRA-2 over Africa (e.g. with more aerosol
composition measurements and better emissions inventories)
would go a long way toward ensuring better quality data from
rapidly proliferating LCS networks on the continent, which can
then be used to make real, substantial progress towards clean
air for all.
