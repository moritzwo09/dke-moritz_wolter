HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
ABSTRACT
Hydraulic fracturing is becoming an increasingly prevalent part of today's society, for
natural gas fuels energy industries. The contaminants used in fracturing fluid pose a threat to
human health. These contaminants can be categorized into volatile organic compounds, metals,
inorganic compounds, dissolved solids, radioactive elements, and microorganisms. This paper
presents a review of literature from studies exploring the adverse health effects of the following
contaminants: benzene, formaldehyde, arsenic, lead, and microorganisms. By ingesting water
near hydraulic fracturing sites, people can develop health complications including cancer,
disease, body system dysfunction, and genetic disruption. Consequently, purifying contaminated
water is necessary to sustain a healthy life.
Key Words: hydraulic fracturing, fracking, groundwater contamination, VOCs, heavy

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
INTRODUCTION
Water is essential for all living organisms to survive, grow, and develop. Comprised of
distinct chemical and physical properties, water is unique from other compounds. Water is the
universal solvent and can form hydrogen bonds with compounds (Knight, Kalugin, Coker, &
Ilgen, 2019). Humans depend on water to fulfill all cell processes, for it constitutes most of a
person’s blood. Blood is vital for cells, as red blood cells help move resources across the human
body. Therefore, when someone is dehydrated, fewer nutrients are delivered to their cells,
inhibiting cell growth and development. Since water comprises about two-thirds of the body, it is
necessary for water to be clean. Otherwise, contaminants can disseminate through the
bloodstream.
Unfortunately, water is polluted by hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, is the process of injecting fluid at high pressure in underground rock formations to
obtain methane, or natural gas. To increase pressure for rock disruption, fracking companies add
contaminants to the fluid, including metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and inorganic
compounds (USEPA, 2020). Fracking wells have a chance of leaking, causing chemicals to
disperse through the fractures and into the water aquifer (USEPA, 2017). The water aquifer is an
underground source of water that can be used for drinking and irrigation; thus, people’s drinking
water can become contaminated from hydraulic fracturing. As a form of waste disposal, fracking
fluid is further injected back into the ground, leading to further contamination (USEPA 2020).
This paper assesses the hazard of consuming contaminated water produced at fracking
sites. The chemicals in fracking fluid are divided into groups: dissolved solids, VOCs, inorganic
compounds, and metals. For the purpose of this review, the most lethal chemicals were chosen.

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
Of the VOCs, benzene was selected to represent the deleterious effects of aromatic
hydrocarbons, and formaldehyde was chosen to represent aliphatic hydrocarbons’ health effects.
Arsenic and lead were designated to represent metals due to their carcinogenic properties.
Although fracking fluid itself does not contain microorganisms, microorganisms inhabit fracking
sites because they consume hydrocarbons in polluted water. Therefore, this paper also includes
the harmful effects that microorganisms pose to human health. Because hydraulic fracturing
introduces VOCs, metals, and microorganisms into water, consumers develop adverse health
effects.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Benzene
One of the carcinogens in fracking water is benzene, an aromatic VOC that causes
immune system dysfunction and acute myeloid leukemia. A study conducted by McHale and
colleagues examined the injurious health effects associated with benzene exposure (McHale et
al., 2011). In this study, researchers sampled 250 shoe manufacturing workers who were exposed
to benzene as well as 140 controls who were unexposed. Benzene was found to interfere with the
immune system, specifically B-cell receptor signaling and T-cell receptor signaling. Moreover,
researchers discovered that benzene altered ATP synthesis; this disruption is especially harmful
since cells require ATP for energy to perform specialized cellular tasks. Benzene was also found
to alter cell apoptosis, which can lead to several types of cancer such as acute myeloid leukemia.
The carcinogenicity of benzene is caused by metabolization, a process where molecules
are broken down into energy that cells use to function (Smith 2010). After benzene is

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
metabolized, benzene’s metabolites can disrupt the genetic code by causing chromosomal
mutations. Although this single genetic disruption is not enough to cause leukemia, mutations
from benzene’s metabolites can accumulate over time. A study was conducted on mice that
proved metabolites of benzene can cause genetic instability in a similar fashion to ionizing
radiation (Smith 2010). Since benzene’s metabolites incite further levels of chromosome changes
and genetic mutations, patients exposed to benzene’s metabolites can develop cancer over time.
Although most research explores risk to high levels of benzene exposure, Carugno and
collaborators demonstrated that benzene at low levels of exposure negatively impacts
mitochondrial function (Carugno et al., 2012). The mitochondria is vital for cells to obtain
energy to execute cellular tasks. Without proper regulation of the mitochondria, energy
production can be disrupted. To evaluate mitochondria, researchers examined blood
mitochondrial DNA copy number, or mtDNAcn, which escalates whenever mitochondrial DNA
has been damaged. Carugno and colleagues performed a study that proves low-level benzene
exposure increase mtDNAcn. In Italy, the collaborators held a multicenter cross-sectional study
on people exposed to low-levels of benzene through cigarette smoke and measured the
individuals’ age, sex, and number of cigarettes a day (Carugno et al., 2012). In Genoa, Carugno
and colleagues found a 10.5% increase of mtDNAcn in benzene-exposed individuals than in
unexposed individuals. In Milan, individuals displayed an 8.2% increase of mtDNAcn when
exposed to benzene. Based on the data, benzene caused the levels of mtDNAcn to increase,
which showed the patients’ mitochondrial DNA had been damaged. This increase of mtDNAcn
was associated with a higher risk of developing lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(Carugno et al., 2012).

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
Increased blood mtDNAcn levels were also associated with cells that face oxidative stress
(Carugno et al., 2012). Oxidation can occur in the human body due to reactive oxygen species
(ROS). When cells are exposed to benzene, the amount of ROS increases above healthy levels.
While ROS bolsters the immune system by blocking foreign invaders, an unregulated amount of
ROS can lead to oxidative damage and premature cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
are especially prone to ROS damage because they have less protective histones. When cells are
impacted with ROS, more copies of mtDNA are created to compensate for damage. While this
seems like a beneficial mechanism, increased mitochondria generates more ROS, inducing
further oxidative damage and cell death (Carugno et al., 2012).

Formaldehyde
Hydraulic fracturing water also includes formaldehyde, an aliphatic hydrocarbon and
known carcinogen. According to the National Cancer Institute cohort, including over 25,000
formaldehyde-exposed workers in 10 plants, formaldehyde exposure was associated with
increased nasopharyngeal cancer (Swenberg et al., 2012). In addition, formaldehyde increased
the risk of adult and childhood asthma and acute respiratory tract illness. Because formaldehyde
is highly reactive in air and is water soluble, 95% of formaldehyde can be inhaled and absorbed
within the nasal and upper airways. Furthermore, formaldehyde altered pathways associated with
inflammatory response, cancer, and endocrine system regulation (Rager et al., 2011).
Exposure to formaldehyde can also reconfigure the genetic code in nasal and lung cells
by altering amounts of microRNA, or miRNA. miRNA induces cellular disease and regulates
gene expression after transcription (Rager et al., 2011). Alteration of miRNA levels cause

cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. On a smaller scale, this can impact the
degree of cell apoptosis, cell proliferation stress response, and metabolism (Adlakha & Saini,
2014). To verify that formaldehyde modified miRNA levels, Rager and colleagues exposed
human lung cells to 1 ppm of formaldehyde and created an environment that imitated the human
respiratory tract. Out of the 343 miRNAs assessed for formaldehyde, 89 miRNA demonstrated a
decrease in expression. The down regulation of miRNA leads to tumors and chromosome loss,
ultimately causing cancer, including breast cancer and leukemia (Rager et al., 2011).

Arsenic
Along with VOCs, fracking water contains metals, and one prevalent metal in fracking
water is arsenic. Arsenic is typically found in an inorganic form in drinking water, yet arsenic’s
colorless, tasteless, and odorless state makes it difficult to detect (Naujokas et al., 2013). In
general, United States wells contained over 3000 μg/L of arsenic. As indicated by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the maximum safety level for arsenic is 10
µg/L (Naujokas et al., 2013). Furthermore, the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study
(HEALS) cohort reported that any concentration of arsenic over 10 µg/L led to 23.5% of chronic
disease related deaths and 21.4% of deaths in general. Arsenic was found to cause several types
of cancer, including lung, liver, kidney, bladder, and skin cancer. Arsenic also induced negative
immunological, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and dermatological effects. Although
these were the most common symptoms, some people developed skin lesions as well. Arsenic
can also lead to deleterious health effects on the cellular level. For example, arsenic affected
cellular proliferation, cellular signaling, apoptosis, and DNA structure (Naujokas et al., 2013).

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
Arsenic also altered the genetic code by causing DNA damage, chromosome abnormalities, and
oxidative stress (Mo et al., 2009).
Arsenic also induces genetic instability throughout the body by disrupting telomerase
activity (Mo et al., 2009). Telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes, and the
dysregulation of telomere length can cause cancer and aging. As cell division occurs, telomeres
shorten, leading to cell apoptosis. Telomerase is an enzyme that attaches telomeric sequences to
the chromosomes’ ends when the cell divides to prevent chromosome degradation. Most normal
cells have minimal or no detectable levels of telomerase activity, but tumor cells express larger
levels of telomerase activity. Human telomerase consists of an enzymatic subunit called human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In order to find the relation between arsenic and
telomerase levels, Mo and researchers measured the hTERT mRNA levels in blood samples
collected from residents of Inner Mongolia who had been exposed to arsenic in their drinking
water. The researchers found that the mRNA levels of hTERT increased significantly at 0-1 µM
of arsenic exposure. However, the mRNA levels of hTERT decreased at 2.5-10 µM of arsenic
exposure. Both an increase and decrease of hTERT levels (telomerase activity) were injurious to
human health. Decreased telomerase activity inhibited DNA repair and caused fragmented
chromosomes. However, elevated levels of telomerase activity allowed cancer cells to overcome
mortality, as these cells did not experience a loss of telomere length (and chromosome
degradation) during cell proliferation (Mo et al., 2009).

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
Lead
Another injurious metal found in fracking water is lead, severely affecting both adults
and children (Sanders et. al., 2010). Lead impacts several parts of the brain: the prefrontal
cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. When these pathways are targeted, people can
develop neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and
schizophrenia. Lead ingestion also results in convulsions, comas, and decreased muscle
coordination. Physically, lead exposure can cause muscle and joint pain in adults. Children are
also impaired by lead, as children exposed to lead score lower on intelligence tests and exhibit
lower hand-eye coordination and reaction time. For every exposure to 10 µg of lead, a child lost
one to five points on the IQ test. Lead exposure can also instigate hyperactivity in children, a
condition that makes paying attention and sitting still more difficult (Sanders et al., 2009).
Lead exposure can also disrupt biological functions at the cellular and molecular level by
initiating cell apoptosis and altering mitochondrial function (Sanders et al., 2009). Additionally,
lead contact degraded an individual’s genes in the brain, liver, and lung. Similar to benzene, lead
generated ROS, which was dangerous to a person’s health. ROS increase was directly correlated
with neurological damage, as neurons lost the ability to remove ROS toxicity with oversaturated
ROS levels. Lead also decreased antioxidants, and thereby, heightened oxidative stress (Sanders
et al., 2009).

Microorganisms
In addition to VOCs and metals, fracking water contains a diverse population of
microorganisms. According to Kahrilas and colleagues, several microorganisms in fracking
water were Spirochetes, Clostridia, Synergistetes, Bacteroidetes and proteobacteria. Furthermore,

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
sulfate-reducing bacteria resided in water near fracturing sites, which produced hydrogen sulfide.
Because hydrogen sulfide gas caused corrosion of underground tubing, petroleum and other
contaminants were leaked into the groundwater (Kahrilas et al., 2015). Additionally, fracking
water contained methanogens, microorganisms that produce methane. Some methanogens
include Archaea, Halomas, and Marinobacter (Mouser et al., 2016). Methanogens Halomas and
Marinobacter inhabited fracking sites because these sites contained the aliphatic and aromatic
hydrocarbons that enabled methanogens to thrive.
Although not all microorganisms are toxic, methanogens can induce adverse health
implications. For instance, due to methanogens’ ability to efficiently break down calories,
drinking water containing methanogens caused humans to develop obesity since they required
increased caloric intake (Chaudhary et al., 2018). Furthermore, methanogens increased the
production of fatty acids. Methanogens also heightened inflammatory bowel disease and chronic
constipation (Lurie-Weinberger & Gophna, 2015).

RESULTS
Benzene
The study conducted by McHale and researchers underscored that benzene interfered
with numerous pathways (McHale et al., 2011). McHale and collaborators assessed the
probability of the null hypothesis that benzene does not significantly interfere with various
pathways. As shown by Figure 1, p < 0.05 for 67 cases, rejecting the null hypothesis. There were
only two exceptions ‒ at low levels of benzene for protein export (p = 0.053) and at high levels
of benzene for insulin signaling pathway (p = 0.052).

Formaldehyde
To determine the carcinogenic effects of formaldehyde, an experiment performed by
Monticello and Kerns was assessed (Swenberg et al., 2012). In this experiment, Monticello and
Kerns exposed rats to formaldehyde for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The colleagues measured the

amount of cell proliferation, demonstrating tumor growth. As shown in Figure 2, formaldehyde
exposure was directly correlated to cancer growth. When exposed to 14 ppm of formaldehyde,
the tumor incidence rate increased by 30-70% for each of the rats (Swenberg et al., 2012).
Although Monticello and Kerns exposed rats to formaldehyde, humans were around 2.17 times
more sensitive than rats to formaldehyde (Swenberg et al., 2012).

Arsenic
Chen and collaborators performed a study in Taiwan that measured the mortality risk of
developing kidney, bladder, lung, and liver cancer with various arsenic levels in drinking water
(Smith et al., 1992). As more water was ingested, people developed a higher risk for cancer. The
highest mortality rates were found in people who have consumed around 800 µg/L. Specifically,
the most frequent cancer contracted are bladder and kidney cancer. Overall, females were more
susceptible to develop these cancers than men.

Lead
Gillis and colleagues exposed subjects to ~4.4-5.8 µg/L lead and analyzed the gene
expression (Gillis et al., 2012). According to Figure 4, the two most prevalent pathways lead
regulated were cell death and macromolecule metabolism. Furthermore, since p < 0.05 for each
affected pathway, there was a strong correlation between lead exposure and adverse health
effects.

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
DISCUSSION
Based on Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4, consumers of fracking water developed numerous health
complications because hydraulic fracturing introduced hazardous VOCs, metals, and
microorganisms into drinking water. Collectively, most human body systems were negatively
impacted due to contaminant exposure. Furthermore, fracking water altered cell processes and
genes, leading to cancer and possibly death. Accordingly, people should unequivocally consume
clean water, one of the most essential, yet limited, resources.

Benzene
As shown in Figure 1, almost all the pathways were affected by benzene exposure. One
system affected by benzene was the immune system, specifically the T-cell receptor signaling
pathway. T-cells are crucial for attacking pathogens; if the regulation of T-cells is not maintained
properly, the immune system will not be able to function adequately. The digestive system was
also impacted, as the probability of developing an infection from Heliobacter pylori from all
levels of benzene exposure was significant. An infection from H. pylori led to stomach ulcer
formation (Budzyński and Kłopocka, 2014). Benzene also interfered with RNA polymerase
regulation, which is essential for RNA synthesis. Ultimately, these mutations caused by benzene
can lead to cancer, such as leukemia, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

Formaldehyde
Figure 2 revealed a strong relationship between formaldehyde exposure and the chances
of tumor incidence. Cell proliferation increased due to formaldehyde exposure, allowing cancer

cells to rapidly multiply and further disseminate throughout the body (National Cancer Institute,
2015).

Arsenic
According to Figure 3, arsenic exposure was correlated with developing liver, lung,
kidney, and bladder cancer. The liver is vital to the digestive system, lungs are crucial for the
respiratory system, and the bladder and kidneys are important for the urinary system.
Consequently, all of these body systems will be detrimentally impacted if a person consumes
fracking water with any level of arsenic.

Lead
Figure 4 indicated a variety of pathways genetically altered by lead. Lead primarily
dysregulated nucleic acids, which is hazardous because nucleic acids code for every living
organism. Furthermore, nucleic acids enable protein synthesis; proteins execute a variety of
functions such as defense, transport, structure, and catalysis. All of these important functions
were obstructed by lead exposure, for lead caused a down regulation of protein synthesis. Lead
also promoted cell apoptosis, which has a potential to be malignant.

Microorganisms
Microorganisms mainly caused complications in the digestive system, leading to
inflammatory bowel disease and chronic constipation. Furthermore, microorganisms were
correlated with increased obesity in patients. Obesity can lead to a higher risk for heart disease,

diabetes, cancer, and mental disorders (CDC, 2020). While microorganisms did not directly lead
to cancer, they can cause other health implications that increase the risk for cancer and other
malignancies.

Limitations
Though this paper mainly focused on the effect of VOCs, metals, and microorganisms on
human health, there are other contaminants in fracking water. Among these other contaminants
are inorganic compounds and radioactive elements. Certain inorganic compounds, such as
nitrates and nitrites can lead to blue baby syndrome (EWG, 1996). Furthermore, radioactive
elements can disrupt the genetic code, potentially leading to cardiovascular disease and cancer
(EPA, 2019). However, for the scope of this paper, the health effects of VOCs, metals, and
microorganisms represented a sufficient perspective of health complications.

Suggestions for Future Research
Because fracking water impairs human health, discovering an effective method for
purifying water is essential. Although disbanding fracking companies may seem like a more
impactful alternative, fracking provides economic benefit to these companies; as such, this
approach may be impractical. Thus, the most economically friendly and efficient strategy is to
research effective filtration methods to convert fracking water into a drinkable source of water.

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
CONCLUSION
Over time, water has become an increasingly limited resource due to pollution. To raise
awareness about the significance of clean water, this paper focuses on the hazardous health
implications caused by contaminated water. One major source of water contamination is
fracking, for many chemicals used in the process are disposed into the water aquifer. The
contaminants of interest in this paper are benzene, formaldehyde, arsenic, lead, and
microorganisms. In addition, this paper presents how ingestion of these contaminants cause
health issues such as cancer, diseases, human body dysfunction, and improper regulation of cell
processes.
Since each contaminant in fracking water targeted different body systems, fracking water
is lethal to consume. Fracking water contains benzene, a VOC that leads to leukemia, lung
cancer, immune system dysfunction, mitochondrial damage, and oxidative stress. Another VOC
is formaldehyde, which induces respiratory tract illness, cell proliferation, and alterations to
miRNA levels. In addition to VOCs, metals such as arsenic and lead were detected in fracking
water. Arsenic exposure induces lung, liver, kidney, and bladder cancer and disrupts telomerase
levels. Furthermore, lead-exposed patients can develop Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
neurological disorders, and oxidative stress. People can also develop obesity, inflammatory
bowel disease, and chronic constipation due to microorganisms. Water contaminated by
hydraulic fracturing is life-threatening, and widespread access to clean water is imperative for
improving public health.
