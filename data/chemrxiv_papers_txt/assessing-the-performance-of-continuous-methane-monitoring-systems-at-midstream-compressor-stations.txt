ABSTRACT

10

Continuous Monitoring Systems (CMS) are a promising technology to detect and quantify

11

intermittent and high-volume methane emissions across the oil and gas supply chain. This is

12

particularly salient at midstream compressor stations where the contribution of short duration

13

emission events to total emissions make survey type technologies less suitable to develop

14

accurate measurement informed inventories. In this work, we report on the first concurrent and

15

long-term test of five CMS technologies to detect, localize, and quantify methane emission from

16

two major types of midstream compressor stations found in the US – a turbine-only station and

17

an engine-only station. We find that CMS technologies can distinguish between different

18

operational states of the compressor only under conditions of low background methane

19

emissions. Combining known events at these facilities with in-situ controlled releases, we

20

observe that all CMS technologies generally struggle in identifying short duration or low-

21

emission rate (relative to baseline) events. Critically, we find that positive event detection, based

22

on analysis of underlying methane signals, frequently did not translate to alerts sent to the

23

operators. Deployment of CMS at midstream compressor stations must proceed with caution

24

based on specific applications, site configuration, and the nature of baseline emissions.

Introduction

28

Methane (CH4), the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas with a

29

global warming potential 80 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. 1 The Oil and

30

Gas (O&G) sector is a significant source of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the U.S. 2, 3

31

Concerns over the climate impacts of increased global use of natural gas has led to the

32

development of new regulatory actions and voluntary initiatives to reduce CH4 emissions

33

across the O&G supply chain. 4 They share an important feature: an emphasis on the use of

34

empirical or measurement-based approaches to detect, quantify, and mitigate emissions. This

35

is the direct result of recent studies around the world that conclusively demonstrated that

36

official CH4 emission inventories underestimate emissions compared to measurements. 5-8

37

CH4 emissions from O&G supply chain including production, midstream, and

38

downstream distribution sectors have been quantified by different detection technologies

39

deployed on platforms including handheld sensors mobile lab vehicles, drones, aircraft, and

40

satellites. 9-17 These multi-scale snapshot measurements have identified key features relevant

41

to the development of accurate emission inventories and to direct mitigation efforts. These

42

features include the contribution of super-emitters to total emissions, the prevalence of high-

43

volume and intermittent emission events, and the identification of abnormal process

44

conditions as a root cause for large unintended emissions.18-20 Despite progress, these

45

technologies and platforms only provide snapshot estimates of emissions and would require

46

spatial and temporal extrapolation to accurately estimate annual measurement informed

47

inventories.21, 22 Furthermore, snapshot measurements are challenging in basins where a large

48

fraction of emissions are attributable to short-duration, intermittent emission events. 23, 24

49

Continuous Monitoring Systems (CMS) are a promising class of technologies to detect

50

and quantify both routine and abnormal intermittent emissions at O&G facilities. Several

51

CMS technologies are now available commercially and have been deployed at O&G facilities

52

in limited pilot demonstration studies. 25, 26 Recent studies of CMS under controlled

53

conditions demonstrate challenges in emissions localization and quantification even at simple

54

facilities. Bell et al. presented results from single-blind testing of 11 CMS solutions using a

55

standardized protocol at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC)

56

test facility. 27 They found significant variability in performance across different

57

technologies, marked by unpredictable detection efficacy and high quantification uncertainty.

58

Another controlled release study designed to evaluate the performance of CMS solutions in

59

identifying large releases found that although detection was reasonably effective,

60

quantification was significantly underestimated.28 Such challenges are not limited to

61

controlled tests. Recent work in evaluating CMS at operating O&G production facilities have

62

brought to light challenges in detecting and quantifying emissions. 29 Extracting useful

63

information from CMS deployed at simple production facilities requires extensive scientific

64

modeling that is currently not available from commercial vendors. 9, 30, 31 Notwithstanding

65

variability in real-world performance of CMS technologies, modeling efforts indicate that

66

CMS could reduce the need for higher frequency of snapshot surveys to achieve equivalent

67

emissions reductions or that CMS networks, under optimal design conditions, can detect over

68

90% of intermittent emission events. 32, 33 Furthermore, there is evidence that the

69

performance of CMS technologies, collectively, are improving rapidly and would therefore

70

require periodic evaluation. 34

71

Much of the literature on the testing and deployment of CMS has focused on their

72

performance at simple upstream production facilities. However, midstream O&G facilities

73

such as compressor stations would benefit from effective CMS-based monitoring for several

74

reasons. First, periodic surveys of compressor stations are challenging because of their sparse

75

distribution. Second, large release events at midstream facilities are often intermittent and

76

last only several minutes to a few hours such as blowdowns or seal vents – these would

77

require an impractical number of snapshot surveys to capture accurately in inventory

78

development. Third, technologies that provide top-down, source-level emission estimates

79

have some challenges in accurately detecting and quantifying sources such as compressor

80

exhaust slip. 35, 36 Despite this, no systematic evaluation of the performance of CMS

81

technologies at midstream compressor stations exists.

82

In this work, we report on the first concurrent test of five CMS technologies to detect,

83

localize, and quantify CH4 emission from two major types of midstream compressor stations

84

found in the US – a turbine-only station and an engine-only station. These two facility types

85

encompass the range of emission source types and emission rates found in the midstream

86

O&G sector across the US. The turbine site typically has low emissions under normal

87

operating conditions because of low CH4 slip from the exhaust of the compressor unit.

88

However, the engine site has typically high emissions under normal operating conditions,

89

with a significant fraction attributable to CH4 slip from exhaust. 37, 38 This allows us to

90

evaluate the performance of CMS technologies under a range of background CH4 signals.

91

Combining known emission events at these stations with in-situ controlled releases allowed

92

us to identify conditions under which CMS technologies are effective in detecting, localizing,

93

and quantifying midstream CH4 emissions. Results from this study directly inform the

94

practical deployment and limits of CMS technologies at midstream O&G facilities.

2.1 Site and Technology Selection

97

Methodology

A three-month field trial was conducted at two select natural gas transmission

98

compressor stations in NY state. Site selection was based on several factors including ease of

99

site access, number and type of compressor units, observed aerial CH4 emissions, operational

100

constraints, field test requirements, and site configuration. The two sites represent two types

101

of facilities commonly found across NY state and in the US – a turbine-driven only

102

compressor station (henceforth Turbine site) and a reciprocating-engine driven only

103

compressor station (henceforth Engine site). The Turbine site had one compressor unit at a

104

rated horsepower of 7700 and the Engine site had 5 compressor units, at a total rated

105

horsepower of 18400 (see Supplement Information (SI) section S1).

106

CMS participants were selected through a rigorous selection process based on past

107

performance in field campaigns, availability of controlled test data, technology readiness

108

level, scalability, and stakeholder interest. Five CMS were deployed contemporaneously at

109

selected sites for technology inter-comparison studies and to monitor CH4 emissions

110

continuously with a range of temporal resolution (4 s to 15 min). The location and number of

111

sensors installed per site are determined by prevailing wind conditions, the complexity of the

112

facility, the nature of the equipment, and the facility safety guidelines. The layout of two

113

selected facilities and the deployment of sensors of five CMS are shown in SI section S1.

114

The specifications of five selected CMS technologies are shown in Table 1 (also see SI

115

section S2).

2.2 Definition of detection
The five CMS technologies are classified into two types of systems: (1) type-1 system is

134

an emission-rate-based system that reports CH4 concentrations intermittently but quantifies

135

emission rates and monitors emission events in near-real-time. (2) type-2 system is a non-

136

emission-rate-based system that reports real-time high-resolution atmospheric CH4

137

concentration measurements with no built-in quantification.

138

For both types of systems, we need to define “detection”, which is a non-continuous

139

variable with possibility states of “yes”, “no”, and “maybe”. For the type 1 system, we

140

combine information from (1) near real-time emission rate estimates and (2) alert reports of

141

CMS - if an event is captured by both (1) and (2) data sources, then the state of “detection” is

142

“yes”; if none of the sources report the detection, the state is “no”; if only one data source

143

reports “detection”, we define it as “maybe”.

144

For the type 2 system, we define a metric – “time-averaged detection fraction” which

145

refers to the fraction of concentration data points from downwind sensors that meet or exceed

146

a threshold of CH4 concentration enhancement above baseline for a pre-determined duration

147

of known emission source. We evaluate the concentration enhancement thresholds of 1 ppm

148

in estimating the time-averaged detection fraction. For a particular emission event, we first

149

determine the upwind and downwind sensors based on the average wind direction during the

150

event period – sensors that are located within ± 90 degrees relative to the wind direction are

151

identified as the upwind sensors and the rest are classified as downwind sensors. Then, the

152

average CH4 concentration of all the upwind sensors is considered as the baseline CH4 value

153

for this emission event. We calculate the fraction of data points of downwind sensors that

154

meet the threshold - if the calculated “time-averaged detection fraction” of an emission event

155

is more than 60%, then the detection state is “Yes”; if the calculated “time-averaged detection

156

fraction” is less than 30%, then the detection state is “No”; if the calculated “time-averaged

157

detection fraction” is between 30% and 60%, then the detection state is “Maybe”. Tech D

158

and Tech E constitute the type 1 system, and Tech A, Tech B, and Tech C belong to the type

159

2 system. Tech A and Tech C also have alert systems set up but no quantification function.

160

Tech B has no alert system.

162

2.3 Operational data

163

During the three months of deployment from August 1st to October 31st, 2022, there

164

were 25 and 6 routine or maintenance activities reported at the Turbine site and Engine site,

165

respectively (see SI section S4). Major operational activities include blowdown events,

166

blowing drips, non-routine venting, filter changeout, and Lockout/Tagout (LOTO)

167

procedures for the unit. In addition, we collected throughout parameters, leak detection and

168

repair (LDAR) records, and other operational information to evaluate the performance of

169

CMS.

170
171

2.4 Controlled release tests
In-situ controlled release tests were conducted at both compressor stations in October

172

2022. These tests are not designed to extract probability detection curves for the

173

technologies, which require long-term testing at a controlled release facility across a broad

174

range of emission rates.27 Instead, these releases are used to evaluate the ability of CMS to

175

detect, quantify, and localize intermittent emission sources of similar volumes as seen at a

176

typical midstream compressor station.

177

In total, 41 controlled releases were conducted over the course of one week at two sites

178

(SI section S3). The duration of the controlled releases varied from 5 minutes to 2 hours,

179

mimicking typical intermittent emissions seen at compressor stations such as blowdown

180

events. Emission rates varied from 5 kg/h to about 100 kg/h, corresponding to observed

181

emissions at compressor stations. CH4 was sourced from pressurized tanks in a trailer system

182

and was metered using a micro emission flow meter with an accuracy of ±0.1%. A 100 ft

183

long hose was connected to the flow meter through which CH4 reached a 5 ft or 20 ft high

184

release pipe. A heat transfer system was used to prevent Joule Thompson effect cooling at the

185

release point resulting in a controlled release at ambient temperature and pressure conditions.

186

To allow for effective plume development through the atmosphere and potential sensor

187

delay, each test included a buffer time of 10 minutes between each release. The locations of

188

the controlled releases were based on considerations of facility layout, typical location of

189

emission sources, prevailing wind conditions, and the need to test all sensor solutions

190

installed at the facility. Controlled releases from multiple locations were also used to test the

191

sensitivity of sensor performance to local turbulence. There were 5 release locations at the

192

Turbine site and 10 locations at the Engine site. For each location, two to three releases with

193

different emission rates, duration, and release heights were conducted to simulate emissions

194

from various equipment on sites (SI section S3). Because these controlled releases happen in

195

identical weather and geographic conditions as the field trials, performance will be more

196

representative of real-world deployment.

197

2.5 Baseline emissions – CH4 signals from compressor stations under normal operating

198

conditions

199

To understand the variability in CMS observations under normal operating conditions of

200

the compressor station, CH4 concentration signals of constant operating states of the

201

compressor with no intermittent emission events were determined through a screening

202

process. First, based on the operator-supplied daily operating hours of compressors, we

203

define that a compressor is “operating” when its daily operating hours are more than 2 hours,

204

and it is “not operating” when daily operating hours are less than 2 hours. The Turbine site

205

has two operational states (operating and not-operating) with one turbine compressor and the

206

Engine site has six operational states due to their five engine-driven compressors (0 to 5

207

compressors are in operation). Second, the days on which known routine operational

208

activities or emission events happened are filtered out to refine the CH4 signals for each

209

unique operational state of the compressors. Non-emission-rate-based systems have one more

210

step – we determine the upwind and downwind sensors of each system based on real-time

211

wind conditions and the location of the sensors. Upwind sensors are those that are positioned

212

within a ±90-degree angle of the direction of the wind, whereas the remaining sensors are

213

categorized as downwind sensors. The maximum CH4 concentration among all identified

214

downwind sensors is considered as the CH4 signals from the site.

3.1 Ability of CMS to distinguish between different operational states of the compressor

Results and Discussion

217

The distributions of CH4 concentrations under normal operating status detected by five

218

CMS for each unique operational state at the Turbine and Engine site are shown in Figure 1

219

(also see SI section S5). Since compressor drivers (especially reciprocating engines) slip a

220

high fraction of fuel in the exhaust and the combustion slip is a major component of

221

midstream facilities’ site-level emissions, 39 we investigate the CMS's ability to detect

222

changes in the operational status of the compressor (‘on’ and ‘off’) using a discrimination

223

metric called the operation ratio. The operation ratio is the fraction of the binned probability

224

density of observed CH4 concentrations in the ‘on’ state to that of the binned probability

225

density of observed CH4 concentrations across all operational states. Based on this definition

226

of operation ratio, there are three scenarios: (1) when the operation ratio is 1, the CH4

227

concentration signals are detected only when the compressor is operating, (2) when the

228

operation ratio equals 0, the measured CH4 concentration signals are captured only when the

229

compressor is not operating, (3) when the operation ratio is between 0 and 1, CH4

230

concentration signals are seen in both operational and non-operational states. We can then

231

identify “cut-off” values – the transition point in the range of operation ratio as a function of

232

concentration signal where different operational states of the compressors can be

233

unambiguously distinguished. We make several observations.

234

First, at the Turbine site, regardless of whether the turbine-driven compressor was in

235

operation, there is no significant difference in the probability density of average CH4

236

concentrations (CH4 signals varied between 0.1 and 1.1 ppm between idle and operational

237

states detected by five CMS) indicating that the five CMS technologies tested here cannot

238

distinguish operational and non-operational states of the compressor. This is expected as

239

compressor exhaust from a centrifugal turbine is not expected to be a significant contributor

240

to total site emissions. Technology B and C detected ambient-level CH4 (~2 ppm) most of the

241

time; Technology A, D, and E detected more elevated CH4 signals. At the Engine site, all the

242

technologies detected higher mean CH4 values when multiple engine-driven compressors

243

were operating (CH4 signals varied between 2 and 8.4 ppm between idle and operational (4

244

engines) states detected by five CMS), indicating an ability to distinguish different operational

245

states of the compressor station. This arises because exhaust slip is a significant contributor

246

to total CH4 emissions at this site, and site-level emissions are proportional to the number of

247

operating compressor units.38

248

Second, the distributions of CH4 concentrations under normal operating status across all

249

five CMS technologies show long tails at both sites (also see Figure S3 in SI). At the Turbine

250

site, except Tech D, CMS technologies detect no “cut-off” value which can be used to

251

identify the “on” and “off” states of the compressor. The “cut-off" value detected by Tech D

252

is around 100 ppm and CH4 concentrations above the “cut-off” value are only detected when

253

the turbine-driven compressor is operating (operation ratio equals 1). At the Engine site, all

254

five CMS observe similar “cut-off” values of around 10 ppm above which CH4 concentration

255

levels are only detected when there is at least one compressor unit in operation.

ratio. The average CH4 concentrations of each state are noted in the plots.

262

3.2 Ability of CMS to detect, quantify, and localize known emission events

263

We use two datasets of known emission events to evaluate the performance of CMS,

264

including recorded operational activities and controlled release tests. In total, 38 and 34

265

known emission events happened during the survey period at the Turbine site and the Engine

266

site, respectively.

267

Probability of detection. As described in the Methods section, we use two different

268

principles to define the “detection”, one for the emission-rate-based system (Tech D and

269

Tech E) and one for the non-emission-rate-based system (Tech A, Tech B, and Tech E).

270

Figure 2 shows the fractions of emission events under different detection states detected by

271

CMS. Detailed numbers of events used to evaluate CMS detection capability are provided in

272

SI section S7.

273

Given that the operation of engines emitted considerably more engine exhaust CH4 than

274

turbines 37 – “background” emissions from the Turbine site are lower and the CH4 signals

275

from emission events should exhibit higher concentration enhancements at the sensor,

276

depending on favorable atmospheric conditions. Yet, our results show that most CMS

277

technologies (excluding Tech A) exhibit better performance at the Engine site with relatively

278

higher detection probabilities. This may be partly due to the different composition of the

279

emission events data we collected at the two sites. At the Turbine site, among 38 known

280

emission events, 25 events are operational activities and 13 are controlled releases. At the

281

Engine site, 34 emission events comprise 6 operational activities and 28 controlled releases.

282

Generally, controlled releases are more likely to be detected due to constant flow rates, and

283

longer durations compared to operational activities. Thus, CMS technologies perform better

284

at the Engine site with more controlled release data. This suggests complex temporal profiles

285

of known intermittent emission sources at compressor stations such as blowdown events may

13

286

be challenging to detect in real-time for CMS technologies. Furthermore, Tech E detected

287

notably higher probabilities of “maybe” states at both sites which indicates that the sensors

288

did capture high CH4 signals that didn’t pass the thresholds of its alert system. Thus,

289

evaluating CMS for its ability to detect intermittent emissions should focus on two

290

interrelated challenges: one, accurate readings of CH4 concentration enhancements, and two,

291

analytics to convert concentration readings to emission event alerts to operators. Both

292

challenges need to be addressed for CMS systems to translate to effective mitigation.

298

and localization accuracy of CMS that provides quantitative estimates (Tech A, Tech D, and

299

Tech E) for “detected” events. Due to a lack of data on true emission rates from operational

300

activities, only controlled release emissions rates are used to evaluate the quantification

301

capability of Tech A, Tech D, and Tech E. In general, all three technologies tend to

302

underestimate emission rates, among which Tech D has relatively the best performance.

303

However, Tech D also reported a few high estimated emission rates with relative errors of

304

more than 300%. CMSs report site-level emission rates and the background site-level

305

emissions on the controlled release days can be estimated based on prior aerial surveys of

306

these sites reported in the literature.40 The turbine site was idle during the controlled test days

307

and the Engine site had 4 compressors in operation during the controlled test days. The

308

estimated site-level emissions from aerial measurements were less than 5 kg/h and 87 kg/h

309

for the Turbine site and Engine site, respectively, under the same operational status as that of

310

the controlled test days. The controlled release rates (5 to 100 kg/h) are less than or

311

comparable to the background site-level emissions at the Engine site and thus, the total

312

emission from the Engine site on the controlled release days should be higher than the

313

controlled release rates. If we add the site-level emissions of 87 kg/h from aerial

314

measurements to the emission rates of controlled releases conducted at the Engine site, the

315

average relative quantification error of Tech A, Tech D, and Tech E will change from -

316

75.4%, 18.8%, and -30.8% to -97.7%, -84.7%, and -88.7%, respectively, providing further

317

evidence for potential significant underestimation of emissions.

318

For all the emission events detected by Tech A, Tech D, and Tech E, we evaluate their

319

localization capability by comparing the emission equipment identified by CMS with known

320

source locations/equipment. If the estimated equipment is the true equipment that emits CH4,

321

we consider the localization results as “accurate” and calculate the fraction of emission

322

events with accurate localization results over all the detected emission events as shown in

323

Figure 3(b). Tech A and Tech E have higher localization accuracy at the Turbine site

324

compared to the Engine site. Given that the Turbine site is smaller with only one compressor

325

unit compared to the Engine site with 5 compressor units, localization is expected to be more

326

accurate at the Turbine site compared to the Engine site. The performance of Tech D in

327

localizing emission sources at two sites is similar, but the overall localization accuracy

328

(~35%) is lower compared to Tech A and Tech E (SI section S8).

Sensor up-time. Since each sensor of five CMS technologies reports data periodically (Table

338

1), we calculate the uptime fraction of a sensor that is operational during the three-month

339

deployment period. Figure 4 shows the up-time fraction of all five CMS technologies. The

340

metal-oxide sensors of Tech A, Tech B, Tech D, and Tech E are operational for over 90% of

341

the test period. However, the up-time of Tech C’s laser-based sensors varied at both sites –

342

at the Turbine site, the up-time fraction ranged between 76% and 90%; at the Engine site, one

343

sensor of Tech C was offline for nearly 30% - 40% of the survey period, and the overall up-

344

time fraction varied between 60% and 91%. This is relevant in the context of the recently

345

finalized US EPA methane rule that requires CMS to have an operational uptime of over

346

90% on a rolling 12-month average period.41

3.3 Ability of CMS to estimate event duration at compressor stations

351

Three technologies (Tech A, Tech C, and Tech D) have the capability to estimate the

352

duration of detected emission events through alert reports. Figure 5 shows the distribution of

353

duration of intermittent events as detected by Tech A, Tech C, and Tech D at both

354

compressor stations. In addition, we also show the duration distribution of known emission

355

events, including controlled release tests and operational emission events provided by the

356

operator. Known operational emission events include blowdowns, blowing drips, filter

357

changeout, and Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures for the unit.

358

First, Tech A estimated longer durations (>5 h) of emissions at both sites. Tech C and D

359

estimated most emission events to be between 30 and 100 minutes. Based on information

360

about known operational activities and controlled release tests, we estimate that known

361

events have an average emission duration of about 30 minutes. By comparing this

362

distribution with those estimated by the CMS technologies, we evaluate the effectiveness of

363

these systems in accurately estimating emissions duration. In general, the emission duration

364

estimated by Tech C and Tech D is distributed around 30 min, reasonably well matched with

365

the distribution of the duration of known events. Second, all three CMS tend to overestimate

366

the duration of emission events, among which Tech A identified some long-duration events

367

that are over 5 hours at both sites – conversation with site managers suggested no such long-

368

duration emission event occurred at either site and thus Tech A’s reading were either wrong

369

or misattributed a continuous source to an intermittent event. Recently, the U.S. EPA

finalized updates to subpart W reporting that requires accurate estimates of the duration of

371

large release events. Our results indicate that significant improvements are needed to

372

attribute and estimate the duration of intermittent emission events.

3.4 Performance evaluation of non-emission-rate-based CMS under different control
variables

379

The protocol for controlled release tests encompasses several variables, including

380

duration, emission rate, release height, and release location. We investigate the probability of

381

detection using the time-averaged detection fraction metric as a function of emission rate and

382

event duration as shown in Figure 6. Intuitively, the time-averaged detection fraction of an

383

emission event by CMS can be improved as the emission rate and duration of the emission

384

event increase.

385
386

At the Turbine site, for the events with the same emission duration, higher emission rates
events have higher probabilities of detection as shown by the increasing trend in time18

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qfdbh ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8385-6573 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

387

averaged detection fraction. Whereas there is no obvious correlation (Pearson’s correlation

388

coefficient = 0.02) between the time-averaged detection fraction and the emission rate at the

389

Engine site. Compared to the estimated site-level emissions from an aerial survey with the

390

same operational states of compressors at two sites,38 we find that controlled releases

391

conducted at the Turbine site are considerably higher than its typical site-level emission (<5

392

kg/h) which makes it more likely for CMS to distinguish enhancements from the controlled

393

release against the background; most of releases (24 out of 28) conducted at the Engine site

394

are lower than the site-level emissions (~87 kg/h), which is likely to make detection of

395

concentration enhancements against background challenging.

396
397

Tech A and Tech C have higher time-averaged detection fractions across all the
controlled releases compared to Tech B.

398
399

400

releases detected by Tech A (red circle), Tech B (blue circle), and Tech C (green circle) at

401

the Turbine site and the Engine site as a function of known emission rate (x-axis) with the

402

threshold of 1 ppm enhancement above the baseline. The size of the circle indicates the

403

duration of the emission event. The estimated site-level emissions from aerial measurements

404

are labeled for the two sites.

405

The performances of emission-rate-based CMS technologies (Tech D and Tech E) under

406

these controlled variables are also explored and the results are shown in SI section S9.

407

Briefly, on the one hand, no obvious improvement in the detection probabilities and
19

408

quantification/localization accuracy of Tech D and Tech E are found as a function of

409

increasing emission rate. On the other hand, the detection probabilities and localization

410

accuracy are higher when the duration of the emission event is longer (~ 120 min). Thus, the

411

high temporal resolution of CMS measurements may compensate for the high uncertainty

412

when translating the raw concentration measurements into emission event identification.

413
414

3.5 Inter-comparison of CH4 signals detected by co-located sensors
Sensors of different CMS technologies located within 10 m are considered “co-located”

415

sensors and can provide opportunities for cross-validation and performance evaluation of

416

different technologies, eliminating interference from complex atmospheric dynamics. We

417

analyzed the correlation of CH4 measurements detected by 7 pairs of co-located sensors of

418

Tech A, Tech B, and Tech C at two sites during the three-month field trial. CH4

419

concentrations reported by Tech D and Tech E are preprocessed data and are not comparable

420

to the measurements of other technologies. The information on the co-located sensors and the

421

calculated correlation coefficient are shown in SI Figure S1 and Table S6.

422

Due to the limitation of the non-normally distributed dataset, we calculate the Spearman

423

rank-order correlation coefficient (ρ) for each pair. The interpretation of ρ are as follows (the

424

descriptor applies to both positive and negative relationships)42, ≥0.7 – very strong

425

relationship, 0.4-0.69 – strong, 0.3-0.39 – moderate, 0.2-0.29 – weak, and 0.01-0.19

426

negligible relationship. We calculated the correlation coefficient for raw CH4 measurements

427

and CH4 enhancements (background subtracted CH4 data) of each co-located sensor pair. The

428

CH4 enhancements are determined by subtracting the minimum CH4 concentration in each

429

15-minute interval from the raw data to address variation in baseline readings of different

430

CMS technologies due to factory settings or calibration issues.

431

Raw CH4 signals vs. background subtracted CH4 signals detected by co-located sensors.

432

Figure 7 shows the results for the five co-located pairs of Tech B and Tech C at two sites. We

433

find that the correlation coefficients between the raw CH4 signals detected by co-located

434

sensors vary from 0.15 to 0.45 (Table S6). Two pairs have strong relationships (ρ >0.4), one

435

pair correlate moderately, and the rest of the pairs have weak or negligible relationships (ρ

436

<0.3). After subtracting the background CH4 signals to focus on CH4 enhancement, in

437

general, the correlations between each pair become slightly stronger, increasing, on average,
20

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qfdbh ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8385-6573 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

438

by about 2%. There are no obvious differences between the correlation coefficients in each

439

month.

440

We also investigated the relative performance of co-located sensors under different

441

operational statuses of the compressors (see Table S6 in SI). Background subtracted CH4

442

signals from compressor stations were filtered using a two-step process (as described in

443

section 2.5) to exclude CH4 enhancement from known operational activities and keep the

444

operational condition constant for different operational statuses. We have two observations.

445

First, correlation coefficients of CH4 signals after the filtering process for background signals

446

and emission event enhancements are higher than the raw CH4 signals, and only background

447

subtracted CH4 was detected by co-located sensors. Second, at the Turbine site, relationships

448

between co-located sensors are comparable regardless of the status of the compressor. At the

449

same time, relationships between co-located sensors at the Engine site are generally stronger

450

when more compressors are operating.

451

As shown in Figure 7, correlation coefficients of co-located pairs between the same two

452

technologies are independent of the distance between co-located sensors. The larger

453

correlation coefficient (ρ =0.52) indicates a strong relationship between the CH4

454

measurements detected by the co-located sensors of pair #1 at the Engine site with a distance

455

of 10 m. Based on the location of the two sensors at the site (see Figure S1 in SI), we find

456

that pair #1 is deployed in an open area of the Engine site that is downwind of major

457

emission sources (e.g., compressors and blowdown silencer) based on prevailing wind

458

direction (southwesterly) during the three-month survey period. Thus, sensors of pair #1 tend

459

to capture more elevated CH4 signals leading to better correlation.

468

We conducted a comprehensive long-term study of the performance of five CMS

469

technologies at midstream compressor stations. The two types of stations chosen for the

470

study – a turbine site with low exhaust CH4 slip and an engine site with significant CH4

471

emissions from the exhaust – represent the range of emissions observed at midstream

472

facilities across the U.S. By combining known emission events and in-situ controlled

473

releases, we evaluate the performance of CMS technologies in detecting, quantifying, and

474

localizing emission events.

475

The analysis and results shown in this study indicate that CMS technologies need to be

476

employed cautiously, especially for compact and complex O&G facilities. The findings of

477

this work suggest that emissions from compressor stations can vary substantially over time

478

under different operational statuses. But even as a continuously operating monitoring system,

479

CMS has the potential to miss emission events with low emission rates and/or short

480

durations. A better understanding of the uncertainties of the quantification and localization

481

features of CMS will be useful for these solutions to improve performance. Furthermore, the

482

alert systems of CMS need to be set up with more consideration for the nature of baseline

483

emissions and the location of these sensors to achieve the goal of quickly detecting large

484

emitters. As these technologies rapidly improve, a full understanding of the performance of

485

CMS requires further evaluation before widespread deployment.
