ABSTRACT (244 words)
Particulate matter (PM) air pollution presents a major environmental and public health challenge
because of its non-uniform size distribution and chemical composition. Air quality regulations
generally categorize particulate matter (PM) size into PM10, PM2.5, and ultrafine particles (UFPs)
with aerodynamic diameters < 10, 2.5, and 0.1 µm, respectively. We examined the differential
impact of particle size per se on selected organ systems using a custom whole-body mouse
exposure system using synthetic PM (SPM). The micrometer-sized SPM accumulated in the
lungs as the primary entry organ, while ultrafine SPM showed less accumulation, implying a
transition into circulation. Micro SPM-exposed mice exhibited inflammation and NADPH
oxidase-derived oxidative stress in the lungs. Ultrafine SPM-exposed mice did not show
oxidative stress in the lungs but rather at the brain, heart, and vasculature levels. Endothelial
dysfunction and blood pressure increase were more pronounced in ultrafine SPM exposed mice,
supported by increased endothelin-1 and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression,
enhancing constriction and reducing vasodilation. To derive a preliminary estimate of the
cardiovascular disease burden of UFPs in humans, we used new high-resolution exposure data at
a global scale, and applied hazard ratios from an epidemiological cohort study. We derived a
UFP-associated incidence of 419 (95% CI 78–712) thousand cardiovascular disease cases per
year in the European Union and 5.6 (95% CI 1.1–9.3) million globally. This work provides novel
insights into the different toxicological profiles of inhaled ultrafine particles and public health
consequences of exposure, guiding future studies.

INTRODUCTION
Air pollution is a major contributor to non-communicable diseases 1. The Global Burden of
Disease study ranks air pollution among the leading risk factors for mortality and disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) 2, with annual excess mortality estimates ranging from 8.7 million 3
to 10.2 million 4. Particulate matter (PM), a significant component of air pollution, is particularly
harmful 5. PM includes all solid and liquid particles in the air 6, 7 and varies in sources, structure,
composition, and size. PM's composition depends on its origin (naturally or anthropogenic) and
environmental interactions 8, 9. PM is commonly classified by diameter: PM10 (<10 µm), PM2.5
(<2.5 µm), and ultra-fine particles (UFP, <0.1 µm) 10, with most health studies and regulations
focusing on the mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 11. Research done during the last two
decades revealed the difference in toxicity between PM10 and PM2.5, as the larger particles do not
penetrate as deeply into the respiratory tract and are more easily eliminated 12-14. It is important to
remember that PM10, on its own, still presents a significant risk factor for many diseases 15,
probably also due to loading with environmental toxins. The health differences between UFP and
PM2.5 remain understudied, and only a few cohort studies have been reported. This is mainly
because UFP were, until recently, not routinely measured in air pollution networks.
Ambient PM typically has a mineral or carbon core and carries chemicals like inorganic salts,
organic compounds, transition and heavy metals, and endotoxins 8, 16, 17. However, measuring PM
size and number concentrations is more straightforward and less expensive than composition
differentiation, especially for particles in the PM2.5 and PM10 size ranges 18. Accordingly, PM2.5
and PM10 mass concentrations (in µg/m3) are widely adopted parameters in health studies and
regulations, while UFP mass concentrations are less commonly measured and used 19, 20. Smaller
particles tend to be more harmful than larger particles, and research often focuses on PM2.5 over
PM10 10, 21. UFPs are considered especially detrimental, likely due to their ability to penetrate the
air-blood barrier 22, 23. While UFPs often dominate ambient particle size distributions by number,
they only comprise a small fraction of PM2.5 mass 24. Thus, using PM2.5 or PM10 mass
concentrations as a predictor for health endpoints not only disregards the composition of particles
but also the differential toxicity of particle sizes within PM. While smaller particles contribute
comparatively little to mass concentrations, they may be disproportionately more harmful. While
previous large clinical studies often excluded UFP health effects since reliable quantification of

nanoparticles represented a challenge, recent technological innovations and more affordable
devices now enable UFP measurement more broadly.
A study from China showed that only particles smaller than 1 µm (PM1) are positively associated
with cardiovascular morbidity 25. Another study from China demonstrated a positive association
between PM in the size range of 0.25 – 0.5 µm and cardiovascular mortality while observing no
significant association with mortality from respiratory diseases 26. A study in Erfurt, Germany,
found a similarly higher risk for cardiovascular mortality from UFP compared to respiratory
mortality 27. The results of these two studies support the transmigration of nano-sized particles
through the lung and direct damage to remote organs. A recent study in Copenhagen, Denmark,
established that hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases positively
correlated with an increase in UFP concentrations 28. Interestingly, after adjustment for PM2.5 all
associations with respiratory diseases decreased, while associations with cardiovascular disease
increased, pointing to a direct effect of UFP, but not of larger PM, on the cardiovascular system.
Data from a Dutch cohort corroborate the findings of cardiovascular disease association with
UFP rather than coarser PM, highlighting this through a two-pollutant model where UFP
remained the only positively associated variable for cardiovascular risk 29. On the other hand, in a
cohort from Toronto, Canada, no change in the association between UFP and acute myocardial
infarction and congestive heart failure was observed after correcting for exposure to PM2.5 and
•

NO2 30, and this was confirmed by another study on airborne nanoparticle concentrations

reporting an association with increased mortality risk in Canada’s two largest cities 31. The
European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) also found no correlation
between PM2.5 concentrations and all cardiovascular disease deaths 32.
There is substantial epidemiological and clinical evidence for a major contribution of PM to
adverse human health effects, and that not only the respiratory system is affected, but remote
organ systems as well 33. Numerous studies have been conducted on the differential effects of the
PM composition, providing an overview of the role and contribution of different toxicants carried
by airborne PM 34-36. On the other hand, the studies addressing the effects of PM size have been
inconclusive. The reasons are the focus on air pollution-derived UFP that exhibits a high load-tomass ratio of surface toxicants, which impedes detection of size effects 10. Further, the use of
biologically inert PM, e.g. for contrast agents, drug delivery systems and food or cosmetic
stabilizers has generated contradicting findings 37, 38. Especially in preclinical research,

chemically inert particles, such as TiO2, silver, gold, or synthetic carbon/plastic particles have
been used 39-41.
This study aimed to determine if ultrafine or nanoparticles penetrate the air-blood barrier more
easily than microparticles and if they can be detected in remote organs. We also sought reliable
functional and molecular markers related to cardiovascular and pulmonary systems to
differentiate the level of harm and tissue transmigration between particle sizes. Hazard ratios
from a Dutch cohort were used to extrapolate UFP effects on cardiovascular disease incidence in
humans, highlighting the importance of nanometer-sized particles in disease outcomes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
With the present studies, we investigated the biological toxicity of nano- versus micro-sized
synthetic particles with emphasis on their potential to transmigrate through the lung epithelium
into the bloodstream and to cause damage to other remote organs (e.g. the aorta, heart, and brain).
We used fluorescence-labeled or magnetic nano- versus micro-sized particles to trace their
biodistribution. In the second part we estimated UFP effects on human cardiovascular disease
incidence at a global scale.

Organ distribution of PM
The size distributions of the used SPM are presented in suppl. Figure S2. Since particle mass is
proportional to the diameter cubed, when exposing animals to the same mass concentration, they
are exposed to more individual particles in the nano SPM exposure categories.
After the exposure to fluorescent micro- or nano SPM, mice were sacrificed and extracted lungs
were imaged with a fluorescence imager (Figure 1A, B). The lungs of mice exposed to micro
SPM showed a pronounced difference in fluorescence when compared to non-exposed mice,
while lungs of nano SPM exposed mice showed a more subtle increase in fluorescence intensity
(Figure 1A). The more pronounced increase in fluorescence intensity after the micro SPM

exposure points to the accumulation of the particles in the lung, while the lower fluorescence
after nano SPM exposure points to the migration of particles from the lung tissue into circulation.
After the exposure to magnetic micro or nano SPM, mice were subjected to a whole-body rodent
MRI depicting the abdomen of the mice (Figure 1C, D). The T2* relaxation values of the tissue
were measured, enabling the calculation of R2* parameter maps. We hypothesized that the iron
particles may accumulate in the heart (Figure 1E) and liver (Figure 1F) when they enter the
body, and therefore these organs were examined for contrast changes due to the presence of
magnetic SPM. No statistically significant changes were observed in either organ, although a
trend toward a reduction in R2* values was observed in the nano SPM exposed mice.
Using synthetic particles, i.e. free from detrimental air pollutants, we show that the size of PM
plays a significant role in detrimental effects on multiple organ systems. This suggests additive or
synergistic adverse effects by small particle size and a high load of toxicants due to high
surface/mass ratio combined with high particle number concentrations 23, 42. Ambient particles
contain chemically active substances (such as transition and heavy metals, peroxides, quinones,
endotoxins) known to induce inflammation and oxidative stress 43-47. The limitations applying for
our animal studies, e.g. particle size distribution, sufficient concentrations for MRI contrast, are
explained in detail in the online supplement.

Vascular function in nano- and micro SPM exposed mice
Systolic blood pressure, as measured by the tail-cuff method, was increased after exposure to
both the fluorescent and magnetic nano SPM (Figure 2A, C). Blood pressure was not changed
after the exposure to fluorescent and magnetic micro SPM. Endothelium-dependent vascular
relaxation achieved through ACh titration showed a right shift after exposure to fluorescent nano
SPM but not after the exposure to fluorescent micro SPM (Figure 2B). The endotheliumindependent vascular relaxation in response to nitroglycerin was not changed upon fluorescent
SPM exposure. The exposure to both magnetic nano and micro SPM caused a right shift in the
endothelium-dependent relaxation curve by trend, but no clear pattern emerged (Figure 2D). The
exposure to magnetic SPM also did not affect the endothelium-independent vascular relaxation in
response to nitroglycerin. Aortic protein expression of endothelin 1 (ET-1) was also increased in

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hhn4v ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-0094 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

mice exposed to the magnetic nano SPM, together with a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) by trend (Figure 2E, F).
The elevated levels of ROS in the aortic tissue that were observed after exposure to nano-sized
SPM correlate with the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and the lowering of
eNOS expression by trend. Elevation of ET-1 expression, a potent vasoconstrictor that is
upregulated by oxidative stress 48, points to the ability of nano-sized PM to promote vascular
dysfunction. Another pathway by which PM can influence the cardiovascular system is by
activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the amygdala stemming from the
translocation of the UFPM through the olfactory nerve 49. The activation of the SNS leads to the
release of catecholamines which cause vascular constriction, blood pressure increase and vascular
inflammation 50, 51, also observed here together with the increase in cortical ROS production. In
addition, modulation of the SNS can lead to disruption of the circadian rhythm, further disrupting
cardiovascular redox balance by phase shifts of genes encoding for ROS producing and
degrading proteins 52. In addition, air pollutants cause circadian rhythms impairment by adverse
redox regulation of the clock core components such as period, cryptochrome, clock and BMAL1.
It was also previously observed that SPM can disrupt cardiac function through myocardial injury
and apoptosis via ROS 53.

Oxidative stress in different tissues of PM exposed mice
Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining was used to assess spatial oxidative stress levels in aortic,
pulmonary, and cortical tissue of SPM-exposed mice. Fluorescent nano SPM showed a
significant increase in oxidized DHE-derived fluorescence in both aortic and cortical tissue
(Figure 3A, B). The fluorescent micro SPM did not change the oxidative stress status in these
tissues compared to the non-exposed control. Magnetic nano SPM exposure caused again
increased oxidized DHE fluorescence signal (Figure 3C, D), which was absent upon exposure to
magnetic micro SPM. In the pulmonary tissue, the magnetic micro and nano SPM showed an
increase in oxidized DHE-derived fluorescence (Figure 3E). The lung tissue of fluorescent SPMexposed animals could not be evaluated due to excessive fluorescence background originating
from the accumulation of fluorescent particles in the lungs of exposed mice.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play a major role in vascular dysfunction as they interfere with
the important pathways regulating vascular tone. Nitric oxide (·NO), as an important signaling
molecule, is susceptible to oxidative stress, as the reaction with superoxide (·O2-) not only creates
peroxynitrite (ONOO-) at the expense of ·NO, but it also impairs ·NO production by uncoupling
eNOS 7, 48. Here the origin of ·O2- can be attributed to the activation of the NADPH oxidase
(NOX1/2), which is also supported by the elevation of the PKC activity through phosphorylation
of MARCKS.

Protein markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiac and pulmonary tissue
NADPH oxidase subunits NOX1 and NOX2 protein expression was elevated in lung tissue of
magnetic micro SPM, but not in the lung tissue of nano SPM exposed mice (Figure 4A, B). In
addition, the NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox was measured but did not show a trend in either
micro or nano SPM exposure groups (Figure 4C). Protein kinase C alpha 1 (PKCα1), which
promotes NADPH oxidase complex formation, was also elevated in the lung tissue but
phosphorylated myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (P-MARCKS), a marker of PKCα1
activity, was not changed (Figure 4D, E). CD68 was also elevated in the lungs of micro SPMexposed mice, indicating local inflammation initiation (Figure 4F).
In cardiac tissue, it was the nano SPM that produced a significant effect. NADPH oxidase subunit
NOX2 and the phosphorylated p47phox showed a significant increase in protein expression
(Figure 5A, B), pointing to the activation of the ROS-producing complex. Monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a marker of inflammation, was also elevated in the cardiac
tissue of nano SPM, but not the micro SPM exposed mice (Figure 5C). P-MARCKS' expression
was increased upon nano SPM exposure, indicating kinase activity (Figure 5D). Heme
oxygenase 1 (HO-1) was significantly upregulated in the hearts of both nano and micro SPMexposed mice, indicating the activation of the antioxidant defense through the Nrf2 pathway
(Figure 5E). The expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), was not observed to be
significantly changed (Figure 5F).
Inflammation also leads to the development of vascular dysfunction, e.g. by oxidative burst of
activated leukocytes upon tight adhesion to the endothelium or infiltration into the vascular
wall54. Elevated levels of CD68 in the pulmonary tissue of micro-sized SPM point to local

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hhn4v ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-0094 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

11

inflammation in the lung, which is also accompanied by increase in ROS production, while
increased expression of MCP-1 in the cardiac tissue of nano-sized SPM point to the ability of
these ultrafine particles to transmigrate through the lung epithelium, reach the circulation and to
cause inflammation and remote organ damage, e.g. in the cardiovascular system.

Global exposure to UFP
Potential cardiovascular health impacts of ambient levels of UFP were also studied by combining
exposure data with results from an epidemiological cohort study. Figure 6A presents the countrylevel, mean, and population-weighted exposure to UFP, aggregated from the downscaled data
available at a spatial resolution of 0.1° latitude and longitude. The time period considered is one
year for which coincident emission inventories and measurement data were available, based on
recently published results 55. We concentrate on long-term –rather than acute– exposure because
chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are associated with cardiovascular,
cardiometabolic, and cerebrovascular diseases 56. We find that countries with the highest
exposure are found in the Middle East and some parts of Asia, to a large degree associated with a
high degree of urbanization. Annual and country mean concentrations reach up to 20,000
particles cm-3, e.g., in Singapore, Arabian Gulf states, and Egypt, and somewhat lower (up to
11,000 cm-3) in other Middle Eastern countries (e.g., Israel, Jordan), and South and East Asia.
Exposure is also very high in South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, and several South
American, North African, and Eastern European countries. In Europe, country and annual mean
UFP exposure ranges from about 2,000–3,000 cm-3 in Scandinavia, 10,000 cm-3 in Balkan states,
and 4,000–6,000 cm-3 in Western and Central Europe.

CVD incidence from UFP
We combined the downscaled UFP exposure data (0.1° resolution) with hazard ratios of the
increased risk for incident CVD adopted from an epidemiological cohort study 29 and computed
the attributable fractions as a function of UFP number concentrations. Results are shown in
Figure 7. The cohort study was performed in the Netherlands, and considering it is the only one
of its kind, we assume it is representative of conditions and the population in Europe. For the 27
countries of the European Union (EU-27) we estimate a UFP-attributable CVD incidence of 419

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hhn4v ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-0094 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

12

(95% CI: 78–712) thousand per year for a total population of 446 million. The highest incidence
occurs in Germany, with 82 (15–142) thousand per year, followed by Italy with 67 (13–115) and
France with 42 (8–71) thousand per year. Since these are relatively populous countries in the EU27, we additionally estimated the per capita incidence and found that it is highest in Greece, with
171 (37–256) per 100,000 population per year, followed by Hungary, with 165 (34–253) and
Bulgaria with 159 (30–267) per 100,000 annually, whereas it is lowest in Ireland with 33 (7–53)
and Finland with 43 (8–74) per 100,000 population per year.
If the Dutch cohort study would also be representative worldwide (absent dedicated cohort
studies), we derive a yearly global CVD incidence of 5.6 (95% CI: 1.1–9.3) million, attributable
to the exposure to UFP (Figure 7). Since the global CVD incidence from all causes is 47.1 (95%
UI: 40.9–53.9) million per year 2, the UFP-attributable incidence amounts to a fraction of about
11–12% of the total. Figure 6B shows these estimated fractions for all countries worldwide,
suggesting particularly relevant implications for CVD incidence from UFP exposure in Middle
Eastern and South Asian countries, for example. These results should be considered preliminary,
i.e., first-order estimates until additional epidemiological studies become available that account
for air pollution, including UFP, and health conditions in representative regions of the world. The
annual global mean per capita CVD incidence due to UFP is estimated at 76.2 (95% UI: 16.2–
115.2) per 100,000 population. CVD is the globally leading cause of death, amounting to 18.6
(95% UI: 17.1-19.7) million per year, nearly one-third of the all-cause mortality 57. By further
hypothesising that CVD incidence is proportional to CVD mortality, we estimate that 2.0 (95%
UI: 0.4–3.3) million CVD-related deaths per year could potentially be attributable to UFP
exposure.
Our European and global estimates of UFP exposure and potential consequences for CVD
incidence are preliminary and associated with uncertainties. The annual average UFP
concentration in the cohort study of Downward et al. (2018) 29, performed among residents of
major metropolitan areas in the Netherlands, was 11,110 (±2,400) particles cm-3. This is at the
higher end of that observed in European cities (e.g., between Milan and Barcelona) but lower
than in Chinese cities and Arabian Gulf states, for example 58, 59. It captures a good part but not
the full spread we find in global, annual UFP exposure, and clearly, additional cohort studies are
needed to reduce uncertainty. This applies to high-income but especially also to low- and middleincome countries. Even though the Downward et al. (2018) 29 study is the only one available that

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hhn4v ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-0094 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

directly attributes CVD incidence to UFP, it should be noted that these outcomes are qualitatively
consistent with epidemiological studies that relate UFP to hypertension and diabetes 60, 61 and
congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction 62, as well as enhanced mortality risk 63.
Hence, the quantitative outcomes presented here may be uncertain, but there is still a high
likelihood that exposure to UFP contributes to CVD incidence.

CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the distinct biological impacts of nano- and micro-sized synthetic particles
in exposed mice, indicating effects on human health. Nano-sized particles can transmigrate
through lung epithelium into the bloodstream, affecting distant organs such as the aorta, heart,
and brain. This suggests significant direct systemic impacts, extending beyond the pulmonary
effects typically associated with larger micro-sized particles, which tend to remain in the
respiratory system, primarily causing pulmonary damage with localized and possible indirect
systemic health outcomes. Our preliminary assessment based on data of human exposure to air
pollution corroborates the detrimental health potential of UFP by their substantial contribution to
the cardiovascular disease burden at the European and global scale.
Our data show that particles with a small diameter (in our study SPM0.25) enhance the oxidative
stress and inflammatory parameters in remote organ systems, while particles with larger
diameters (in our study SPM2.1 and SPM4.1) impact the pulmonary system. This distinction is
important in defining future studies, as different organ systems could be impacted by PM of
varying sizes through different mechanisms, also leading to differential increase in the risk of
specific disease categories, notably cardiovascular versus respiratory diseases, as supported by
several clinical/epidemiological studies on UFP exposure–health associations. Our preliminary
assessment based on data of human exposure to air pollution corroborates the detrimental health
potential of UFP by their substantial contribution to the cardiovascular disease burden at the
European and global scale.
Clinically, these findings emphasize the need for healthcare frameworks to consider particle size
in air pollution regulations and health risk assessments. The ability of nano-sized particles to
cause systemic harm underscores their potential role in exacerbating cardiovascular conditions
and necessitates targeted public health strategies to mitigate their effects. Future regulatory
measures should account for the unique risks posed by ultrafine particles, including revising air

quality standards to better reflect the cardiovascular health risks. This warrants the
comprehensive addition of UFP measurements to air quality monitoring stations so that higher
spatial and temporal resolution exposure maps can be developed to study epidemiological
associations derived from large cohorts.

METHODS
Exposure of laboratory animals
All animals were treated following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as
adopted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and approval was granted by the Ethics
Committee of the University Medical Center Mainz and the Landesuntersuchungsamt RheinlandPfalz (Koblenz, Germany; permit number: 23 177-07/G 20-1-055). All mice were housed under a
12-hour light/dark cycle in the ventilated animal cabinet and fed ad libitum. Male C57BL/6 mice,
8-12 weeks old, were exposed to either fluorescent particles or magnetic particles of two different
sizes each or fresh air. The exposure lasted for 6 hours per day for 3 days. The average
concentration of all synthetic particulate matter (SPM) in the exposure chamber was 230 ± 46
µg/m3. The custom exposure system (described in detail in 64) was acquired from TSE Systems
GmbH (Hochtaunuskreis, Germany). Fluorescent SPM were acquired from Spherotec (Lake
Forest, IL, US), nano SPM (FP-0256-2, Nile Red, 0.25 µm, polystyrene) and micro SPM (FP2065-2, Nile Blue, 2.16 µm, polystyrene). Magnetic SPM were acquired from Kisker Biotech
GmbH (Steinfurt, Germany), nano SPM (PMSI-H-.25-5, superparamagnetic silica-encapsulated
FeOx particles, 0.25 µm), micro SPM (PM4.5, magnetic polystyrene-encapsulated FeOx particles,
4.13 µm). The particles were suspended in CLRwater and placed in the collision nebulizer of the
exposure system. After nebulizing into an aerosol, the particle suspension droplets passed
through a drying column and dry particles entered the exposure chamber. The mass concentration
of SPM was monitored by a particle detector that consists of two instruments for different particle
size ranges combined into a NanoSpectroPan instrument (TSE Systems GmbH, Germany). The
electric field mobility spectrometer measured the particles in the size range from 0 to 0.2 µm, and
the light scattering detector measured in the 0.2 – 35 µm range. The measured values of the mean
SPM mass concentration in the exposure chamber were: 248 ± 66 µg/m3 for nano-fluorescent

SPM, 270 ± 65 µg/m3 for micro-fluorescent SPM, 209 ± 37 µg/m3 for nano-magnetic SPM and
221 ± 27 µg/m3 for micro-magnetic SPM.
The PM concentration range was chosen because 200 – 300 µg/m3 is a peak concentration
reached in the most polluted cities 65, 66, therefore it represents a good starting point for acute PM
effect observations. The relation between mouse exposure and human exposure is approximately
similar. Mice are exposed for only 6 hours per day, giving a ¼ of the total daily exposure, which
is in line with the whole day exposures done previously 67, 68. Mice have a respiratory rate of 80230 min-1 69 and tidal volume of 0.2 mL 70, making the total mass of PM being inhaled during a 6
hour exposure session (approximate chamber concentration of 200 µg/m3) 1.15-3.31 µg
(assuming 100 % PM retention). Assuming the mouse weight of 25 g, the 6 hour exposure
session will result in 46-132 µg/kg/day. Human respiratory rate is approximately 10-20 min-1 and
the tidal volume is approximately 0.5 L. Assuming the body mass of 60 kg and the same
exposure of 200 µg/m3, a human would inhale 24-48 µg/kg/day. Mouse exposure occurs during
sleeping phase when the respiratory activity is in the lower range, we may assume that mouse and
human exposures are on par.
After the exposure mice were sacrificed by transection of the diaphragm and removal of the heart
and thoracic aorta under deep ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (i.p. 120/16 mg/kg body weight), and
tissues were harvested. The mouse exposure paradigm is shown in suppl. Figure S1.

Detection of fluorescent SPM in the isolated organs
After the exposure to fluorescent SPM, mice were sacrificed as described above and organs were
excised. Removed organs were then imaged using the IVIS® Spectrum imaging system
(PerkinElmer Inc, Waltham, MA, US) 71, 72. For nano SPM excitation filter at 500 nm and
emission filter at 560 nm was used, and for micro SPM excitation filter at 570 nm and emission
filter at 620 nm was used. The mean pixels intensity from the images was obtained with the
ImageJ software and used in the statistical analysis.

After the exposure to iron oxide SPM, mice were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose and whole
bodies were frozen at -80°C. Before the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement,
depicting the signal decrease caused by changes in T2* related to accumulated iron particles in the
investigated tissue 73, 74, mice were heated to 25°C and kept at that temperature through the
measurement by using a rectal temperature probe coupled with a ventilation system to maintain
body temperature and avoid T2* drifts caused by temperature changes (Model 1030, Small
Animal Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY, USA). A 9.4 T small animal MRI system with a 0.7
T/m gradient system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) controlled by
Paravision 6.0.1 software was used for the measurements. To image the abdomen of the mice, a
linear whole-body volume transmitter coil combined with an anatomically shaped 4-channel
receive-only coil array for the rat brain was used. A 3D multigradient echo pulse sequence (TE/
TR = (3.5/ 800) ms; average = 2; flip angle = 50°; TA = 1 h 9 min) was carried out, recording 9
echoes with echo spacing = 5 ms to visualize the T2* signal decay. Isotropic voxels were
measured with resolution of (0.25 x 0.25 x 0.25) mm3 resulting in a 192 x 128 x 27 volume
covering a FOV of 48 x 32 x 6.75 mm3. The R2* parameter value per voxel was calculated by
fitting an exponential decay curve to the corresponding pixels resulting in a volume of R2* values
(MATLAB, R2022a; MathWorks; Natick, Massachusetts, USA). The R2* relaxation values were
used for quantification, as the iron oxide SPM function as contrast agents and lower the T2* in the
tissue they are present in.

Exposure model and emissions for human studies
We applied a data-informed global atmospheric modelling method to compute the exposure to air
pollutants. The model for atmospheric chemistry and climate (EMAC) used in this study was
applied at a horizontal resolution of about 1.875° latitude and longitude, with 31 vertical levels
up to 10 hPa (~30 km altitude) 75, 76. The anthropogenic emissions of trace gases and particles
used as model input have been adopted from the Community Emission Data System (CEDS) 77.
Source sectors include fossil energy production, industry, land transport, shipping, aviation,
domestic energy use from solid biofuels, waste incineration, agriculture, solvent production and
use. The CEDS emission data have been produced at a geographical resolution of 0.5°. In
addition, we employed the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR 78) at
0.1° resolution latitude and longitude for downscaling. The emission size spectrum of aerosol

particles depends on the source sectors, according to published work 79, and has been optimized
according to size distribution measurements 55. A comprehensive evaluation of the modelled
atmospheric dust, black and organic carbon, aerosol optical depth, and aerosol organic and
inorganic compounds is presented previously 76.

Downscaling of UFP concentrations
Since the relatively coarse grid resolution of the EMAC model does not do justice to
concentration gradients near strong sources of ultrafine particles (UFP), in particular of primary
particles near areas with heavy traffic and industrial emission hotspots, we downscaled the
simulation results in two steps, first to 0.5° and then to 0.1° latitude and longitude (~9 km at midlatitudes). Observation-guided downscaling was achieved by redistributing the model grid box
average UFP concentration according to the anthropogenic source sectors, available at higher
resolution in the CEDS and EDGAR emission inventories 55. UFP results were evaluated against
the measured number of particles in the size fraction 3 nm to 100 nm, the former based on the
lower size limit of the measurements. A linear relationship between the observed and modelled
particle number concentrations was applied to redistribute the particles toward the source areas,
successively in the 0.5° and 0.1° inventories. Comparison of the results with long-term measured
UFP concentrations at 60 measurement locations in Europe, India, China, North America and
remote locations worldwide indicate good agreement 55. The logarithmic correlation coefficient is
r = 0.95 (the linear r = 0.99), the slope of the linear fit is 1.022, and the root mean square log
error is 0.43.

Estimation of health impacts
Incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), C, attributable to the long-term exposure to UFP at
geographical coordinates x and y, M (x,y), was calculated by:
𝑀(𝑥, 𝑦) = ∑ 𝐴𝐹 [𝑋(𝑥, 𝑦)] ∙ 𝐶 (𝑥, 𝑦) ∙ 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦)
where j refers to the age category >25 years, and X is the concentration of UFP 80. AF is the
attributable fraction of the CVD incidence due to exposure, and P is the population at the
geographical coordinates, i.e., the 0.1° grid cells for which we computed UFP exposure. The
incident CVD and population data have been adopted from the Global Burden of Disease 2. The

AF has been derived from the hazard ratio (HR) associated with exposure to UFP from data of a
published cohort study 81, which identified the increased risk of all incident CVD:
𝐴𝐹 = (𝐻𝑅 (𝑈𝐹𝑃) − 1)/𝐻𝑅 (𝑈𝐹𝑃)
A log-normal exposure-response function was applied to describe the dependency of HR on the
concentration of UFP, according to HRj = exp (β  X). The factor β was estimated from previous
results 81 by using an HR of 1.18 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.34) per 10,000 particles
cm-3, obtaining β = 1.6  10-5 (95% CI: 2.9×10-6 – 2.9×10-5). Note that we did not apply a
theoretical minimum risk exposure level – whether there is one is unknown. The 95% confidence
intervals in all our results have been derived by adopting the ranges as previously described 81.

Statistics
Where possible, the results are presented as bar graphs with individual values. Two-way ANOVA
(with Tukey’s correction for comparison of multiple means) was used for comparisons of
concentration-relaxation curves. One-way ANOVA (with Tukey’s post-hock analysis for
comparison of multiple means) was used for comparisons of all other data. All statistical analysis
was performed in Prism for Windows, version 9. The numerical value of the p-value is either
used directly or a star signifies a p-value < 0.05 that was considered as statistically significant.
The number of replicates in the different assays may vary since not all animals were used in all
assays.

protein expression analysis) are provided in the online supplement.
