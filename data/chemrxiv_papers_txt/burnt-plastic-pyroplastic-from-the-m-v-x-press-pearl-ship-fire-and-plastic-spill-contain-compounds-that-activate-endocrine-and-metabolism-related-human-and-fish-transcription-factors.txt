ABSTRACT
In May 2021, the M/V X-Press Pearl ship fire disaster led to the largest maritime spill of resin
pellets (nurdles) and burnt plastic (pyroplastic). Field samples collected from beaches in Sri Lanka
nearest to the ship comprised nurdles and pieces of pyroplastic. Three years later, the toxicity of
the spilled material remains unresolved. To begin understanding its potential toxicity, solvent
extracts of the nurdles and pyroplastic were screened for their bioactivity by several Attagene
FACTORIAL bioassays (TF, NR, and AquaTox), which measured the activity of a combined 70
human transcription factor response elements and nuclear receptors and 6-7 nuclear receptors for
each of three phylogenetically distinct fish species. Extracts of the pyroplastics robustly activated
end points for the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), estrogen receptor (ER), pregnane X
receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), retinoid X receptor (RXR),
and oxidative stress (NRF2), and the potential for several others. This bioactivity profile of the
pyroplastics was most similar (similarity score = 0.96) to that of probable human carcinogens
benzo[b]fluoranthene and benzo[k]fluoranthene despite the extracts being a complex mixture of
thousands of compounds. The activity diminished only slightly for extracts of pyroplastic collected
eight months after the spill. The AquaTox FACTORIAL bioassay measured the activation of ER,
ER, androgen receptor (AR), PPAR, PPAR, and RXR for human, zebrafish (Danio rerio),
Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), revealing speciesspecific sensitivities to the chemicals associated with the pyroplastics. These findings provide
needed information to guide long-term monitoring efforts, make hazard assessments of the spilled
material, and direct further research on pyroplastic, an emerging global contaminant.

INTRODUCTION
In late May 2021, off the coast of Colombo, Sri Lanka, the ship fire and subsequent plastic spill of
the M/V X-Press Pearl released ~1680 tons of plastic nurdles and other plastic debris, making it
the largest maritime plastic spill in history.1–3 Along with polyethylene pellets, the cargo on the
ship included an assortment of raw materials, hazardous chemicals, and finished products,4 capable
of creating a complex mixture of uncertain toxicity. An observable fraction of the spilled material
included burnt plastic (pyroplastic),4–7 formed during the events of the ship fire. The pyroplastic
was heterogeneous in size and shape and somewhat friable, giving it a greater propensity to form
secondary microplastics than the other spilled material.4,8 The attributes of the pyroplastic
collectively challenged the response efforts and elevated the plastic’s potential for injury to a host
of marine organisms.3,4
At least five forms of plastic were released, including three types of nurdles distinguished by their
color (white, orange, and gray) and two types of pyroplastic characterized by their shape and size
(burnt plastic and combustion remnants) (Figure 1).7,9,10 Pieces of pyroplastic were not only at
least 3-fold more chemically complex because of the fire,4 they were shown to have the greatest
content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of any plastic marine debris recorded to date,
199,000 ng/g.9 Comparatively, the more abundant white nurdles had PAH contents less than
~2,500 ng/g, within the range of other marine debris.9 PAHs are chemical pollutants, many of
which are carcinogenic, raising concern over the release of pyroplastic into the environment. While
substantial, PAHs constituted only a fraction of the chromatographic features resolved within
solvent extracts of the material.4 No phthalates have been detected.4 However, several other
tentatively identified compounds have included chemical additives (e.g., Irgafos 168, 1,3,5tris(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite4; and Bumetrizole (Tinuvin-326), 2-(2-Hydroxy-3-t-butyl-5methylphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole11), their thermal breakdown products (e.g., 2,4-di-tbutylphenol),4 and metals (e.g., Ti, Zn, Mn, Co)7,11,12 as well as unknown compounds,
demonstrating that the pyroplastic included a complex mixture of compounds, many with unknown
bioactivity.

While the M/V X-Press Pearl disaster was a localized, acute release of pyroplastics, these forms
of plastic have been documented globally. Along with other forms of charred plastic, pyroplastics
have been found on coastlines and in waterbodies in Africa,13 Antarctica,14 Asia,15–21 Europe,22–26
North America,26–28 and South America29,30 (Figure S1). To date, the limited chemical analyses
performed for beached pyroplastics unrelated to the M/V X-Press Pearl disaster have shown that
these materials can be enriched in metals, PAHs, and phthalates.19,26 Pyroplastics are an emerging
global contaminant thought to primarily enter the marine environment following fires at the
wildland-urban interface and leaking of openly burned waste.17,31–34
The toxicological concerns for burning plastic are not new, as emphasized by studies of the toxicity
and chemistry of smoke and ash from residential and commercial fires,35 military burn pits,36–38
openly burned municipal waste,33,39–41 landfill fires,42 and fires at the wildland-urban interface34,43
as well as firewater runoff44,45 (the contaminated water produced during firefighting). However,
these studies have not investigated the bioactivity of burnt plastic that remained after the fires were
extinguished; their focus has largely been on aerosols and their impacts on air quality and human
health. Similarly, despite their documented presence globally and unlike other plastic debris,46 the
bioactivity of any pyroplastic is yet to be assessed. Not only is an assessment of potential toxicity
necessary for making a hazardous waste determination of the spilled plastic,9 but there is also a
need to measure its bioactivity owing to the friability of the pyroplastic, the elevated amounts of
PAHs and other chemicals that can be associated with the pyroplastic, and the recognized “Trojan
horse” effect for microplastic and nanoplastics to leach chemical pollutants to biota upon exposure
(e.g., ingestion).47–51
Reporter bioassays have been a valuable method for determining the bioactivity of a chemical or
complex mixture. Targeted bioassays have been used to screen extracts and leachates from
consumer plastics,52–55 plastic photoproducts,56 weathered plastics,46 and combustion-derived
particulate matter and ash,43 Measurements have primarily focused on the activation of the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), pregnane X
receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), and markers for oxidative
stress (NRF2). Though targeted bioassays have been valuable, high-throughput, non-targeted
screens of over 50 end points using the Attagene FACTORIAL platform can provide a more
comprehensive assessment of bioactivity, capable of assigning chemicals and complex mixtures
to specific modes of action.57–64 Additionally, as part of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast program, the FACTORIAL platform has been used to evaluate
more than 3000 chemicals, making it possible to compare bioactivities against an extensive
database of diverse compounds.60,65 Moreover, variations of the platform (i.e., EcoTox and
AquaTox) enable a harmonized cross-species assessment of endocrine and metabolic disruption
upon chemical exposure for humans and wildlife (mouse, zebrafish, medaka, rainbow trout,
chicken, frog, and turtle).66,67 Having such capabilities is valuable to addressing the potential
ecotoxicity of pyroplastics. Recent work uncovering the acute toxicity of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) and its oxidized form (6PPD-quinone) to select salmonids
and not others emphasizes the need to assay across phylogenetically separated species when
assessing the potential ecotoxicity of plastic-associated chemicals.68 This is particularly needed for
the M/V X-Press Pearl disaster as Sri Lankan fisheries rely on numerous, diverse fish species for
sustenance.69

Herein, three FACTORIAL bioassays were used to assess the bioactivity of solvent extracts of
white nurdles and pyroplastic collected within days of, and 242 days after, the M/V X-Press Pearl
disaster. In total, the activities of 70 end points were measured, assessing the induction of human
transcription factors and nuclear receptors related to biotransformation, lipid metabolism, the
endocrine system, immunity, and cell stress, differentiation, and growth. Additionally, the
AquaTox bioassay assessed 6-7 end points for endocrine and lipid metabolic function for each of
three phylogenetically distinct fish species. Our findings provide needed information to guide
long-term monitoring efforts, make hazard assessments of the spilled material, and direct further
research on pyroplastics, an emerging global contaminant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection.
Spilled plastics from the M/V X-Press Pearl disaster were collected from Pamunugama Beach, Sri
Lanka, on May 25, 2021 (5 days after the fire began), and stray plastic related to the spill was
collected from Sarakkuwa Beach, Sri Lanka, on January 17, 2022 (eight months after the spill).
The two beaches are ~2 km apart. The recovered plastic was shipped to the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (Woods Hole, MA, USA) and stored at 4 ºC as collected. All plastic
was manipulated using solvent-rinsed stainless-steel tweezers. The material was visually sorted
according to the categories operationally defined by de Vos et al.4 and James et al.10, i) white
nurdles, ii) burnt plastic, and iii) excised pieces of combustion remnant (Figure 1). Samples from
each category were previously analyzed for their PAH content.9 Orange and gray nurdles were not
assayed because of limited sample quantity, and previous assessments demonstrated that their PAH
composition reflected that of burnt plastic pieces.9
To provide a contrast to the complexity of the white nurdle and pyroplastic released during M/V
X-Press Pearl spill, polyethylene nurdles from the M/V CMA CGA Bianca spill were also
analyzed. These nurdles were released without exposure to additional chemicals from the ship or
transformed by heat and combustion. Nurdles from the M/V CMA CGA Bianca pellet spill were
graciously provided by Professor Mark Benfield (Louisiana State University). The nurdles were
collected on August 13, 2020 (11 days after the spill) from the riverbank area of Chalmette
Battlefield in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.
Solvent extracts.
Solvent extracts were prepared in triplicate by incubating ten nurdles or their equivalent mass of
plastic in 5 mL (~45 mg/mL) analytical grade dichloromethane (DCM) for 24 h at room
temperature in combusted borosilicate glass vials with PTFE/F217 lined caps. DCM was used as
a solvent because it would provide parity with previous chemical analyses conducted on the spilled
plastic,4,9 it is commonly used to prepare extracts from combustion-derived plastics and materials
for bioassays,37,70–73 and many classes of organic compounds, including hydrocarbons, are readily
soluble in it. After extraction, half of the DCM extract (2.5 mL) was blown to dryness under a
gentle stream of nitrogen at room temperature and reconstituted in 100 µL of molecular biology

grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). An extraction blank without plastic was also prepared.
Specifics of each extract are provided in Table S1.
TF-, NR-, and AquaTox- FACTORIAL bioassays.
DMSO-reconstituted DCM extracts were shipped to Attagene, Inc. (Morrisville, NC, USA) for
testing by their TF-FACTORIAL (45 TF specific reporters), NR-FACTORIAL (24 human NRs)
assays (previously named cis- and trans- FACTORIAL assays, respectively), and AquaToxFACTORIAL (6 human NRs and 19 fish NRs).59,60 The assays use HepG2 cells to assess the
activity of endogenous transcription factors (TF assay) or transfected hybrid proteins consisting of
a yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain and ligand-binding domain of the human nuclear receptors
(NR assay) or fish nuclear receptors (AquaTox assay). These multiplexed assays comprised 89
different measured end points related to cell stress, endocrine activity, growth and differentiation,
immunity, and lipid, xenobiotic, and general metabolism.64 Extracts were tested at a maximum
concentration of 3 µL DMSO extract/mL cell culture medium for 24 h. This concentration equates
to the extractable content from ~4 mg of spilled plastic (~20% of the mass of a nurdle). Final
DMSO concentrations were 0.3% (v/v). Five to six technical replicates of DMSO solvent controls
matched to the DMSO concentration of the extracts were run with each sample set. Each extract
was run as three technical replicates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing
1% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS). The pyroplastics were evaluated by each
FACTORIAL assay twice: the first at the maximum tested concentration for each of three extracts
prepared from three independent sets of plastic, and the second as a 6-point serial dilution from
the maximum tested concentration for a single representative extract. Each assay format was run
once.
TF-FACTORIAL assay. HepG2 cells were transfected with TF-FACTORIAL reporter library (46
TF-specific reporter plasmids and seven control reporters) using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Mirus). Transfected cells were plated into 12-well plates
(3105/well), incubated for 24 h in their growth medium, washed, and treated with samples for 24
h in assay media (DMEM with 1% charcoal-stripped FBS). Cells were collected and processed.
NR-FACTORIAL assay. HepG2 cells were transfected with NR-FACTORIAL library (25 GAL4NR expression vector and corresponding reporter plasmid pairs) using TransIT-LT1 transfection
reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Mirus). Each pair of GAL4-NR/reporter was
transfected separately to avoid cross-reactivity. Transfected cells were pooled together and plated
into 12-well plates (3105/well), incubated for 24 h in growth media, washed and treated with
tested samples for 24 h in assay medium (DMEM with 1% charcoal-stripped FBS). Cells were
collected and processed.
AquaTox-FACTORIAL assay. HepG2 cells were transfected with AquaTox-FACTORIAL
library (25 GAL4-NR expression vector and corresponding reporter plasmid pairs) using TransITLT1 transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s protocol (Mirus). Each pair of GAL4NR/reporter was transfected separately to avoid cross-reactivity. Transfected cells were pooled
together and plated into 12-well plates (3105/well), incubated for 24 h in growth media, washed
and treated with tested samples for 24 h in assay medium (DMEM with 1% charcoal-stripped
FBS). Cells were collected and processed.

Sample processing. Total RNA was isolated using PureLink Pro 96 total RNA Purification Kit
(ThermoFisher). Reporter RNA was amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using a single pair of common primers. PCR fragments were labeled with fluorescent
markers, and cut with HpaI restriction enzyme, generating reporter-specific sizes of labeled DNA
fragments that were quantitatively assayed by capillary electrophoresis using a Genetic Analyzer
3500xl. Bioassay responses were expressed as fold-induction relative to the DMSO control by
dividing the treated cells' average technical replicate expression by the average technical replicate
expression of the appropriate DMSO control. Activation of an end point was operationally-defined
as requiring more than 1.5-fold induction across the two independently run assay formats and
having a defined dose-response curve. All activities of an extraction blank were below the
operationally-defined induction cut-off (Tables S2-S3), and all positive control compounds
activated receptors as expected (Table S4).
Statistical analysis.
Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 10.2.3 (347). Data are presented as
mean ± standard deviation (n = sample size). When appropriate, either parametric or nonparametric tests were used to compare groups. Groups were considered significantly different for
a p value less than 0.05. EC50 concentrations and their asymmetrical 95% confidence intervals
were calculated by fitting a three-parameter dose-response curve, 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒 = 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 +
[𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡](𝑡𝑜𝑝−𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚)
. For the dose-response curves, the concentration was defined as the mass of
[𝐸𝐶 ]+[𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡]

extractable content per volume of cell culture medium used in the assay. Sample sizes and
statistical tests are included in the text and figure captions where appropriate.

RESULTS
Chemicals associated with the spilled plastic may leach from the material over time once in the
environment and following ingestion. To assess the amount of chemicals associated with the
spilled plastic, the plastic was extracted with DCM. This slightly polar solvent readily dissolves
petroleum-like hydrocarbons and other hydrophobic compounds typically associated with plastic
found in the environment. DCM extractable contents for the white nurdles, burnt plastic, and
combustion remnant pieces that first washed ashore on May 25, 2021, were 3  4 mg/g plastic
(n=3), 24  2 mg/g plastic (n=3), and 88  2 mg/g plastic (n=3), respectively (Table S1).
Comparatively, the DCM extractable content for the white nurdles and burnt plastic collected on
January 17, 2022, 8 months after the spill, appeared relatively unchanged (unpaired t test with
Welch's correction; p value > 0.05) with values of 5  3 mg/g plastic (n=3) and 19  2 mg/g plastic
(n=3), respectively (Table S1).
To understand many of the biological pathways that could be affected by the complex mixture of
plastic-associated chemicals, the solvent extracts from the spilled plastic were screened for their
bioactivity using several FACTORIAL bioassays (TF, NR, and AquaTox). In total, across the three
different bioassays, the activity of 70 human transcription factor response elements and nuclear
receptors and 6-7 nuclear receptors for each of three phylogenetically distinct fish species were
measured in response to the solvent extracts from white nurdles, burnt plastic, and combustion
remnant pieces.
Extracts of the pyroplastic that first washed ashore on May 25, 2021, activated human
transcription factors and nuclear receptors for metabolic, endocrine, and cell stress, growth,
and differentiation processes.
Bioactivity varied according to the type of spilled plastic. First, a single extract concentration was
tested to semi-quantitatively assess the variability in bioactivity within a sample type (e.g., white
nurdle, burnt plastic, and combustion remnant). Subsequently, dose-response relationships were
constructed for the bioactivity of the pyroplastics. Results were largely consistent across the three
extracts prepared from three independent sets of plastic (Figure 2, Tables S5-S7). The coefficients
of variation of the end points for the burnt plastic and combustion remnant ranged from 0.7 to
16.9% with a mean of 5.2% and 0.2% to 15.6% with a mean of 5.3%, respectively. As a result,
one extract of each plastic type was used as a representative sample (Tables S6-S7) for evaluating
the dose-response activity of the pyroplastics. The variabilities for the activated end points between
the two assay formats were within the reported biological variability of the assays.59,61,74
White nurdles. Of the 45 human transcription factor response elements and 24 nuclear receptors
tested for activity in the TF- and NR- FACTORIAL bioassays, the white nurdles activated only
two end points above the operationally-defined 1.5 fold-induction cut-off. At the concentration
tested, only the aryl hydrocarbon receptor response element (AhRE) and the retinoid X receptor 
(RXR) nuclear receptor exceeded the cut-off. The extracts induced average fold increases in
activity of 1.76  0.48 (n=3) for AhRE and 1.84  0.76 (n=3) for RXR (Table S5). This amount
of bioactivity was comparable (within the same order of magnitude) to that of polyethylene nurdles
collected after the M/V CMA CGM Bianca containership plastic spill that happened along the
banks of the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in August 2020. Extracts of these

nurdles induced average fold increases in activity of 3.79  3.43 (n=3) for AhRE; all other end
points were below the operationally defined cut-off (Table S8). This spill was without fire, and so
the source of the AhRE activity was attributed to hydrophobic organic contaminants from the
Mississippi River that can associate with the nurdles.75 Thus, the bioactivity of the white nurdles
appeared comparable to that of other polyethylene nurdles found in aquatic environments resulting
from a containership spill. This finding also agreed with chemical analyses of their PAH content,
which did not differ from that of other nurdles collected in the aquatic environment globally.9
Pyroplastics. The pyroplastic was more bioactive than the white nurdles, and activation trended
with the amount of extractable material. The extracts from the burnt plastic and combustion
remnant pieces activated several end points related to biotransformation, lipid, endocrine, and cell
stress, growth, and differentiation processes (Figure 2, Tables S6-S7, S9-S10). Specifically, the
extracts activated the pregnane X receptor response element (PXRE) and its nuclear receptor
(PXR), the estrogen receptor response element (ERE) and its receptor  (ER), the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) and its receptor  (PPAR), RXR, the
nuclear erythroid-2 related factor 2-antioxidant response element (NRF2/ARE), the activator
protein 1 (AP-1), and AhRE (Figure 2). The elevated activity of PXR, ER, and PPAR in the TF
and NR assays for pyroplastic extracts suggested that active components of these extracts acted as
direct ligands of PXR, ER, and PPAR.
Several other end points demonstrated defined dose-response relationships that did not exceed the
1.5-fold induction cut-off operationally-defined for activation or inconsistently exceeded the cutoff between the two independently run assay formats (Figure S2, Tables S6-S7, S9-S10). These
end points included the liver X receptor  (LXR), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR),
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), the nuclear receptor related 1 (NURR1;
also known as the nuclear receptor 4A2), the metal regulatory transcription factor 1 response
element (MRE), the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1), the vitamin D receptor response
element (VDRE), and the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor response element (RORE).
The activity of the liver X receptor family (direct repeat 4-binding proteins) response element
(DR4/LXR) and the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) activity were suppressed with increasing
concentration of extractable material (Figure S2). The dose-response curves for AhRE, AP-1,
CAR, ERE, ER, HIF1, LXR, MRE, NRF2/ARE, NURR1, PPRE, PPAR, PXRE, PXR, and
VDRE showed tremendous concordance between the burnt plastic and combustion remnant with
only minor deviations (i.e., the curves lined up on top of one another) (Figures 2 and S2). The
dose-response curves for DR4/LXR, PPAR, RORE, and RXR deviated substantially between
the two plastic types (Figures 2 and S2). The deviation was assessed qualitatively as the relative
difference between the dose-response curves of the individual datasets and those of a doseresponse curve for their combined dataset.

The bioactivity of extracts from the pyroplastic collected eight months after the spill was
slightly diminished.
The bioactivity of white nurdles and burnt plastic collected eight months after the spill trended to
lower values, and no additional end points were activated. On average, all end points in the TFand NR- FACTORIAL bioassays were below the 1.5-fold induction criteria for extracts from white
nurdles collected eight months after the spill on January 17, 2022 (Table S11). As for the burnt
plastic, the induced average fold increase in activity trended lower; however, the activity of RXR
was the only end point with a statistically significant reduction in activity (Figure 3, Table S12).
Overall, the end points were more variable at the later time point, while the variability of the
extractable mass was unchanged between time points. This difference suggested that while the
amount of extractable material did not appear to change, there was a change in its composition
during this period, which is supported by reported changes in the PAH content of the burnt plastic
within this timeframe.9

The bioactivities of the extracts from the pyroplastic were species-specific.
The AquaTox FACTORIAL bioassay revealed differences in nuclear receptor activation among
fish species and between fish and human receptors. End points included the induction of speciesspecific estrogen receptors (ER and ER), androgen receptors (AR), peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPAR and PPAR), and retinoid X receptors (RXR) for humans (HU),
Danio rerio (zebrafish; ZF), Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka; JM), and Oncorhynchus mykiss
(rainbow trout; RT) that were expressed as GAL4-NR hybrid proteins in human HepG2 cells. Only
end points for human receptors (ER and RXR) were activated by extracts from the white
nurdles. Fish ER were largely unresponsive to the extracts from the spilled plastic (Figure 4A);
only medaka ER displayed activity above the 1.5-fold induction criteria in response to the
combustion remnant extract (3.09  0.06, n=3). ER was the most sensitive to the pyroplastic
extracts, and fish ER were more responsive to the pyroplastic extracts than human ER (Figure
4B). Medaka and rainbow trout ER were activated in response to the burnt plastic and combustion
remnant extracts. Human ER and zebrafish ERb expressed activity in response to the
combustion remnant extract. None of the extracts elicited AR activity (Figure 4C). Fish PPAR
and PPAR were not activated by the plastic extracts, while the human PPARs were activated
(Figure 4D-E). Human and medaka RXR showed activity in response to the pyroplastic extracts
(Figure 4F). As with the TF- and NR- FACTORIAL bioassay results, the activity of the nurdles
and pyroplastics collected eight months after the spill trended toward lower values (Figure S3,
Tables S16-S17). In conjunction with these semi-quantitative results made at a single
concentration, dose-activity measurements (Figure S4, Table S18) suggest the potential for the
plastic-associated chemicals to disrupt fish estrogen signaling via different pathways depending
on the fish species. In contrast, their ability to disrupt fish androgen and lipid metabolism via direct
ligand-activated pathways is unlikely.

DISCUSSION
Sources of bioactivity.
The FACTORIAL profiles suggest that the complex mixture of PAHs (and other compounds)
within the pyroplastic extracts reflected that of a single PAH. Several PAHs – especially those that
are possible or known human carcinogens – have been screened by the FACTORIAL bioassays as
part of the ToxCast program and within Attagene’s FACTORIAL database. Profiles of the burnt
plastic and combustion remnant were very similar to those of benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) and
benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF) (similarity score >0.96; 0.74 µM; TF-FACTORIAL profile).
Additionally, the TF-FACTORIAL profiles of the pyroplastic differed from those of other possible
or known human carcinogenic PAHs, including benz[a]anthracene (BaA), chrysene (C0),
benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IND). The AquaTox profiles also reflected
this result, showing comparable similarity to BbF and not to BaP and BaA (Figures S5-S8) except
for their ER activation, which was more akin to BaP and BaA than BbF. Notably, none of the
single PAH compounds mentioned above activated PXRE/PXR and RXR and few activated
PPRE/PPAR while the pyroplastics robustly activated these end points (Figures 2, S5-S8). These
results suggest that other compounds in the complex chemical mixture were the cause of their
activity.
From previous chemical analyses of the pyroplastics, the relative abundances of BaA, C0, BbF,
BaP, and IND were comparable, and BkF was much less abundant than the others.9 Thus, the
FACTORIAL profiles of the pyroplastics are unlikely to reflect the additive sum of the profiles
for the individual compounds within the extracts. At first glance, this outcome aligns with evidence
showing that complex mixtures of PAHs behave differently than single PAHs from a toxicological
standpoint.76,77 Yet, in contradiction to this, the pyroplastic extracts primarily reflected profiles of
a single PAH, but for a profile of a single PAH at a ~10-fold greater concentration than is estimated
to have been in the extract. Future work should investigate the FACTORIAL profiles of PAH
mixtures to better interpret the contributions of each chemical component to the overall toxic
potential of PAH complex mixtures that more represent real-world samples.
The findings reflect and expand on those made for other types of combustion-derived material
(e.g., PAHs). Extracts of ash collected from forest fires at the wildland-urban interface were
assessed for their AhR, ER, AR, interleukin-8, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity,43 which
largely reflected the bioactivity of common combustion-derived chemicals of concern. There were
some indications that other compounds contributed to the total bioactivity. However, their extent
of activation was no more than that of the more common chemicals from an AhR activation
standpoint. The FACTORIAL profiling of the pyroplastics for a much larger number of end points
suggests a similar conclusion – the bioactivity reflected that of common combustion-derived
chemicals of concern (i.e., PAHs). Nonetheless, while the FACTORIAL platform provides a
valuable screen for bioactivity, an ensemble of measures (e.g., transcriptomics and other methods)
is necessary to fully understand the potential modes of toxicity for a contaminant.
Moreover, the pyroplastics from the X-Press Pearl disaster were formed following the combustion
of polyethylene. Other compounds of concern (e.g., dioxins, PFAS) can be formed during the
combustion of halogenated and heteroatom-containing polymers. Thus, investigating pyroplastics

from diverse plastics is necessary to more broadly confirm this similarity to other types of
combustion-derived material.
Bioactivity of the uncollected plastic.
The findings suggest that nearly a year after the spill, the pyroplastics largely retained quantities
and compositions of associated chemicals capable of eliciting bioactivity comparable to when the
material first spilled. This outcome was not entirely unexpected given that polyethylene is used
for the passive sampling of hydrophobic organic contaminants in the environment,78 i.e.,
partitioning between seawater and polyethylene skews toward greater amounts in polyethylene.79
With that in mind, the spilled plastic can accumulate and become enriched in additional
contaminants from the environment.80,81 Continued monitoring of any uncollected plastic will be
necessary to ascertain the extent to which its bioactivity profile and chemical complexity deviate
from those when it first spilled over more extended periods in the environment.
Potential ecotoxicity of the pyroplastics.
Within the first few weeks of the M/V X-Press Pearl disaster, the spilled pyroplastics were
expected to differentially impact wildlife because of their wide range of morphologies and physical
properties.4 The AquaTox results expand upon this point. The data indicate that the potential
toxicological harm from the plastic-associated chemicals will also be heterogeneous because of
species-specific effects. In other words, fish species of comparable size (i.e., capable of ingesting
similarly sized pyroplastics) can be expected to respond differently to the complex mixture of
chemicals that leach from the material. This finding also likely translates to other taxonomic
classes (e.g., birds). While, in hindsight, this conclusion may appear evident to those versed in
comparative toxicology,82,83 during the environmental crisis of the spill, it was likely not at the
forefront of concern. Instead, responders simply needed to know whether any chemicals associated
with the plastic had toxicological potential. This point, however, is significant for monitoring
programs and suggests the need to follow multiple phylogenetically distinct species within the
same taxonomic class and use multiple end point measurements to best capture and assess potential
harm.
Adverse outcome pathways related to the activated end points.
Identifying pathway-based bioactivity in the samples can inform the potential hazards of exposure
to chemicals associated with the pyroplastics. The adverse outcome pathway framework aims to
connect in vitro pathway-based bioactivity (e.g., AhR activation) with organismal-level responses
and adverse outcomes (e.g., cardiotoxicity).84,85 Adverse outcome pathways have been defined on
AOP-Wiki86 for several of the activated end points, including PXR, AhR, ER, PPAR, and NRF2,
while others (AP-1 and RXR) have yet to be established. The most developed adverse outcome
pathways are for AhR and ER, whereby their activation has been connected to early mortality,
several cancers, preeclampsia, cognitive decline, liver fibrosis and steatosis, and reproductive
dysfunction. Activation of PPAR and PPAR have adverse outcome pathways resulting in
vascular disruption, obesity, liver steatosis, cancers, and reproductive dysfunction. The adverse
outcome pathways associated with PXR and NRF2 are more nascent than the others; their
activation includes liver steatosis and vascular disruption. Having identified potential upstream

molecular initiating events with the FACTORIAL bioassays, future work should focus on
hypothesis-driven, in vivo measures of tangential and downstream key events within these
pathways to further guide risk assessment of pyroplastics.
CONCLUSIONS
At the time of the spill, ~1680 tons of plastic debris was released, of which a sizable portion was
burned. By June 2021, ~1610 tons of plastic, debris, and contaminated sand had been recovered
and has since remained siloed in warehouses.3 Part of the prolonged containment of the waste has
resulted from the uncertainty of its hazardousness and the methods for its appropriate disposal.3
From the FACTORIAL bioassays, it appears that the bioactivity of the chemicals associated with
the pyroplastics largely reflects that of presumed and recognized carcinogenic PAHs, specifically
BbF and BkF, despite being a complex mixture of thousands of compounds. This finding suggests
that the material should be handled similarly to other combustion-derived residues (e.g., from
biomass). Conversely, any chemicals associated with the white nurdles appear to pose a
comparatively marginal threat, eliciting relatively minimal bioactivity at their expected
concentrations. Nonetheless, the bioavailability of the associated chemicals, which controls their
effective dosage, remains to be determined. For the stray pyroplastic still in the environment,
continued monitoring is necessary. Pieces of pyroplastic collected nearly a year after the spill
largely retained quantities and compositions of associated chemicals capable of eliciting
bioactivity comparable to when they first spilled. As the material fragments into smaller pieces,
other organisms will become susceptible to it, and other modes of toxicological action will likely
arise (e.g., submicron-sized plastic particles loaded with relatively high levels of
contaminants).87,88 With the detection of pyroplastics across much of the globe and recently in
fish,13 further understanding of their toxicity is needed.
