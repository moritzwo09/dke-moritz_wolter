Abstract

3

Standardized controlled testing of advanced methane detection technologies (solutions) has

4

been identified as a step in demonstrating the emissions mitigation equivalence between these

5

solutions and existing regulatory-approved leak detection and repair methods (e.g., ground-

6

based optical gas imaging [OGI] camera survey) in the US and Canada. In this study, 12

7

solutions consisting of 4 handheld OGI cameras, 4 advanced handheld systems, and 4 mobile

8

(automobile- and drone-based) solutions were tested under a single-blind controlled testing

9

protocol at different periods between 2021 and 2023 at an outdoor test facility that simu-

10

lates emissions from a simple, onshore North American production oil and gas (O&G) facility.

11

Three solutions were tested again 3–12 months after the first test, using the same test protocol

12

and facility to assess how performance changed over time. Results showed that handheld OGI

13

cameras had comparable or better performance in terms of lower 90% probability of detection

14

(DL90), false positive and negative fractions, and higher equipment unit-level localization

15

performance compared to other categories of solutions tested. Advanced handheld solutions

16

had comparable performance with the OGI cameras across all metrics except false positive

17

fraction (much higher), while mobile solutions generally had shorter survey durations com-

18

pared to other solutions. For solutions that tested twice, the performance of 2 of 3 solutions

19

generally improved, illustrating the benefit of regular, comprehensive testing in the develop-

20

ment of solutions. The different value propositions inferred from the various categories of

21

solutions tested suggest that mobile solutions can rapidly survey larger areas to inform more

22

targeted, follow-up inspections with handheld solutions. While advanced handheld solutions

23

can be as effective as OGI cameras, mobile solutions have some difficulties to overcome to

24

make them directly comparable or need to have a different use case.

25

Synopsis

26

To achieve further emissions reductions across the O&G industry, advanced methane detec-

27

tion solutions are potential alternative methods for regulatory LDAR. This study assesses

28

these solutions’ performance through robust, controlled testing.

Introduction

33

The increase in human-induced methane emissions over the last 150 years has contributed to

34

climate change, and mitigating these emissions is an immediate target to limit the planetary

35

mean temperature rise to 1.5 ◦ C to 2.0 ◦ C above the pre-industrial level this century. 1–4

36

Methane, a short-lived (≈12 years) potent greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming

37

potential of 28 times that of CO2 is the primary component of natural gas commonly emitted

38

from the oil and natural gas (O&G) industry. 4 O&G emissions are the second largest source

39

of methane emissions in the United States (US), and it is estimated that methane emissions

40

could be reduced by 75% from the O&G sector globally by implementing already established

41

mitigation approaches, including leak detection and repair (LDAR). 5

42

LDAR programs are implemented in the O&G sector to monitor and identify equipment

43

component leaks (fugitive emissions) to reduce emissions through leak repairs. 6,7 Current

44

regulations in the US and Canada require periodic ground-based LDAR using handheld

45

optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras or portable volatile organic compound analyzers (US

46

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 21) 8,9 with their emission reduction po-

47

tential depending on survey frequency, 10 surveyor’s experience, 11 and scale of application. 12

48

Although these approaches can precisely localize sources, they are labor-intensive due to

49

their small scope of application (component level) compared to the extensive spatial scale

50

of O&G infrastructure. To be regulatory-compliant in the US and Canada, LDAR must

51

be applied to millions of equipment components spread over large geographical areas with

52

variable OGI assets, which has significant time, human labor, and cost implications for O&G

53

operators. 12

54

To address some of these limitations, there has been rapid and continued development

55

of advanced leak detection and quantification (LDAQ) solutions and the increased use of

56

these solutions by O&G operators to internally supplement existing LDAR inspection meth-

57

ods. 12,13 These solutions are attractive given that several advanced LDAQ technologies can

58

detect emissions quickly and cost-effectively (when deployed to monitor large geographical

59

areas) with less susceptibility to human errors, thus representing a promising opportunity

60

to curb methane emissions from the O&G industry. 14–16 LDAQ solutions are either au-

61

tonomous, fixed, ground-based sensors (continuous monitors) or mobile technologies (hand-

62

held, drone-based, automobile-based, and aircraft-based) that require human supervision

63

to operate (survey solutions). Some survey solutions (e.g., aircraft-based technologies) can

64

screen larger spatial areas of O&G facilities to prioritize ground-based inspections of iden-

65

tified emissions using traditional LDAR methods (e.g., OGI camera surveys), rather than

66

requiring those LDAR methods to be applied to every facility. Advances in the spatial

67

and temporal extent of surveys is essential for emission reductions, given that emissions are

68

spatially and temporally variable 17–23 with a small number of facilities and emitters often

69

responsible for a disproportionately large amount of total emissions. 21,24–28 The recent US

70

EPA final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) rules on alternative methane detec-

71

tion approaches have stipulated work practices for the use of advanced methane detection

72

technologies as an alternative to existing regulatory-approved LDAR approaches at well sites,

73

centralized production facilities, and compressor stations, if the technologies meet certain

74

performance standards and are regulatory-approved. 13 Essentially, LDAR based on advanced

75

survey solutions must demonstrate equivalent or better emissions reduction than that based

76

on traditional approaches (OGI camera surveys, etc.). A consensus framework by Fox et al.

77

identified rigorous controlled testing of solutions using standardized protocols as a step in

78

achieving this objective. 29

79

Previous controlled testing of survey solutions used study-specific protocols with limited

80

test complexity 30–35 or standardized protocols with narrow scope of application. 32 These

81

studies assessed the performance of aircraft-based, 30–34 drone-based, 31,35 automobile-based, 31,32

82

and handheld solutions. 32 Studies by Ravikumar et al. 31 and Bell et al. 32 during the ARPA-

83

E MONITOR 36 and the Stanford - Environment Defense Fund Mobile Monitoring Challenge

84

programs, respectively, are notable for testing and comparing the performance of multiple,

85

different survey solutions. While Ravikumar et al. used a series of non-standardized pro-

86

tocols with varying complexity and scope during testing, Bell et al. applied a standardized

87

protocol (an early version of the protocol used in this paper - SI Section S-5) that was not

88

representative of expected field application of survey solutions. The protocol used by Bell

89

et al. limited the emissions scenarios and the number of controlled gas releases conducted

90

during the study, influencing tested solutions’ survey methodology and pace. In addition, a

91

recent study by Liu et al. evaluated the quantification performance of 10 solutions composed

92

of mobile (drone, automobile, and aircraft), ground-based (fixed camera system), and hand-

93

held (OGI camera) technologies at a non-operational compressor station in Spain. While

94

the study tested a wide range of controlled release rates (0.01–50.0 kg CH4 /h) and emission

95

point heights (1–28 m), the study was partially blind (i.e., only release rate was unknown to

96

participants) and implemented study-specific test protocol (i.e., timing of controlled releases

97

was constrained to ≈2 hours, etc.) with a small number of experiments (17). 37 These stud-

98

ies therefore suggest the need for consensus, standardized, and field-representative testing

99

protocols for assessing the performance of survey solutions.

100

In this paper, we present results of the first controlled testing of a variety of survey

101

solutions using a consensus and field-representative protocol developed by the Advancing

102

Development of Emissions Detection (ADED) project. 38 Although the survey test protocol

103

has been used for aircraft-based solutions, 39–41 this study is its first implementation for

104

automobile-based, drone-based, and handheld (including OGI cameras) solutions. In this

105

study, 12 different solutions were tested at different periods between May 2021 and November

106

2023 (3 solutions tested twice) at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center

107

(METEC), Colorado State University (CSU), Fort Collins, Colorado. For each solution,

the study evaluated metrics such as the probability of detection (POD) curve, false positive

109

fraction (FPF), false negative fraction (FNF) (i.e., 1 - true positive fraction (TPF)), survey

110

time, and localization accuracy and precision, while also assessing how the performance of

111

solutions that were tested twice changed based on these metrics.

112

Methodology

113

Test Facility

114

Controlled-release testing was conducted at METEC at different periods between May 3rd ,

115

2021, and November 5th , 2023. METEC is an open-air test and research facility (GPS coordi-

116

nates: 40.59559, -105.13984) located at CSU, Fort Collins, Colorado, that simulates fugitive

117

and vent emissions behavior associated with typical North American production facilities

118

using more than 200 representative emission points (e.g., flanges, connectors, etc.). METEC

119

is composed of decommissioned surface O&G equipment (e.g., wellheads, separators, conden-

120

sate tanks, flare stacks, and a compressor and dehydrator unit) embedded with strategically

121

hidden emission points, which are arranged into five well pads and a small compression sta-

122

tion. Each equipment unit and group is identified with unique tags, respectively (SI Table

123

S-1). The test center defines an equipment group as a cluster of adjacent, similar equipment

124

units in a well pad. Controlled releases (emissions) are actuated electronically to transport

125

gas from onsite compressed natural gas (CNG) storage tanks through buried, small-diameter

126

steel tubing to the emission points. A matrix of thermal mass flow meters (OMEGA FMA-

127

17xx series) and manual pressure regulators downstream of the CNG storage tanks control

128

gas flow to emission points, and an onsite gas chromatography device is used to determine

129

the composition of gases released at the site at all times. METEC also has a ≈7 m stationary

130

3-D sonic anemometer that records meteorological data (e.g., relative humidity, wind speed,

131

etc.) at a frequency of 1 Hz. See Zimmerle et al., Bell et al., and Ilonze et al. for more

132

details about the test center and the gas transport system.

133

Testing Process

134

The controlled testing protocol used in this study was a result of the same multi-stakeholder

135

collaboration under the ADED project that produced the protocols used by Bell et al..

136

Ilonze et al. to test continuous monitors. 42,43 A protocol development committee (PDC)

137

consisting of more than 75 members consisting of environmental NGOs, state and federal

138

regulators, LDAQ technology developers, academic institutions, and O&G companies worked

139

on the protocol draft developed by CSU. The protocol consisted of testing methodology and

140

performance metrics, and went through 1 PDC review cycle to obtain the currently published

141

version. 44 The protocol tests and evaluates a survey solution’s system-level performance:

142

the performance of the methane sensor, data analytics, and deployment (e.g., number of

143

passes, flight speed, height, etc.) as an integrated unit. The sensor component of a solution

144

collects raw measurement data (e.g., ppm, ppm-m, etc.) while aboard a deployment platform

145

(e.g., aircraft, automobile, handheld, etc.) during a flying, walking, or driving survey at a

146

preplanned pace, distance, and height over or around O&G asset(s). The raw data gathered

147

is then processed by solutions’ data analytics/algorithm, which might be proprietary, to

148

produce actionable data (e.g., identifying a leak, localizing an emitter, estimating emission

149

rate, etc.). The survey protocol divides testing into 3 activities:

150

• Documentation of the system under test: Solutions were encouraged to document

151

descriptions of the system configuration (e.g., model number of each hardware, revi-

152

sion number of software, etc.), components (e.g., sensor, deployment platform, etc.),

153

methodology applied (e.g., number of passes, flight speed and height, etc.), and the

154

personnel needed to perform emissions surveys at O&G facilities. See details in Section

155

5.1 of the survey protocol. 44

156

• Emission surveys: The survey protocol divided testing into experiments conducted

157

during the day (i.e., typically between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. US mountain time) for 3 to

158

5 days. An experiment consisted of one or multiple, simultaneous controlled releases

159

of CNG, each emitting at a steady emission rate for minutes to hours with longer-

160

duration experiments designed to investigate performance variation due to changing

161

meteorological conditions. Testing was single-blind, as the solutions were unaware

162

of the timing, location, and release rate of controlled releases. For each experiment,

163

METEC defined a survey area that consisted of either a single or two adjacent well

164

pads and initiated controlled gas releases. The well pads at METEC were divided

165

into 3 survey areas: well pads 1 & 2, 3, and 4 & 5 to achieve different site sizes and

166

operational configurations as shown in SI Figure S-1.

167

While testing across multiple O&G infrastructures and wellpads facilitated the evalu-

168

ation of survey time, a key performance metric for solutions, differences in the surface

169

area, layout, and equipment unit characteristics (e.g., type, count, orientation, etc.)

170

of the wellpads also varied testing complexity and rigor. For this study, well pad 1

171

& 2 (20 m × 10 m) contained 6 equipment units, well pad 3 (10 m × 60 m) had 7

172

equipment units, while well pad 4 & 5 (60 m × 120 m) contained 18 equipment units.

173

Additionally, to further vary test complexity, each experiment’s controlled release(s)

174

were either restricted to a well pad or was distributed across all or a portion of the

175

survey area defined by METEC for this study.

176

All controlled releases were CNG, with a mean gas composition by volume of 76.0%–88.0%

177

methane, 11.6%–20.1% ethane, 1.4%–3.6% propane, and trace amounts of other gases.

178

The release rates of gases tested match to within an order of magnitude the component-

179

level leak sizes previously measured by the study team at natural gas production sites

180

in the US, excluding liquid unloading or major failure conditions that produced ex-

181

ceptionally high-rate emission events, 45–47 which the type of solutions tested would

182

typically encounter during actual field deployments. The test center recorded the

183

timing, emission rate, location (i.e., emission points and GPS coordinates), and gas

184

composition of controlled releases. As with Ravikumar et al., the release schedules in

185

this study were intentionally complicated (i.e., variation in the position and number of

186

emission sources per experiment and the survey areas used during such experiment) not

187

only to improve testing complexity but to minimize scenarios where gas odor provided

188

consistent cues to surveyors during testing.

189

At the start of each test day, the study team briefed solutions’ surveyors about safety

190

and how the test will be conducted for the day. During each experiment, solutions

191

conducted emissions inspection based on their survey protocol(s), staying within the

192

boundary of the survey area defined for the experiment. Multiple solutions were some-

193

times deployed in the same survey area during an experiment and therefore had overlap-

194

ping survey times. In such cases, solutions alternated while surveying each equipment

195

unit and had instructions to avoid communicating with one another to prevent one

196

team from learning about emission points or rates from another team. Measurements

197

by solutions were sequenced to limit the impact (if any) of one system’s detection

198

methodology on others. The one exception to this goal was a scenario that included

199

both a drone-based solution and an automobile-based solution. Drone flights generate

200

turbulence and disturbances that can affect the formation and downwind transport of

201

gas plumes to be measured by the automobile-based solution typically driving at the

202

edge of the survey area. The end of the emissions survey by solution(s) signaled the

203

end of each experiment, then the test center stopped all controlled releases.

204

• Detection reporting: The test protocol stipulates a reporting template for solutions

205

to record data of experiments and detected emissions. Solutions conducted quality

206

control and validation of their data before reporting to the test center. Solutions were

207

encouraged to submit recorded data to the test center at the end of each test day

208

containing at minimum the detection report ID, timing of surveys, source location,

209

and the gas species measured to make detection (SI Section S-6). Reporting measured

210

gas species allowed performance analysis of solutions with either methane-specific or

211

multi-species sensors to be on the same basis. See sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.3 of the protocol

212

for comprehensive details of all the data that solutions can report during the study. 44

213

Performance Metrics

214

For data to be considered valid, solutions were required to submit their survey and detection

215

reports within one week of test completion. This time limit reflects common field prac-

216

tice. 22,48,49 The study team collated and quality controlled all data, including release rates

217

and meteorological data collected by the test center, and all data reported by solutions to

218

perform detection classification. The test center kept an operator log and a maintenance

219

record during the testing period to facilitate the detection classification process and the

220

exclusion of data (i.e., controlled releases and detection reports) invalidated by the require-

221

ments of the test protocol. 44 For each solution, the operator log documented the unique ID

222

and characteristics (i.e., timing, number of emission points, etc.) of each experiment; the

223

ID was communicated to the solution during testing for documentation. The ID linked the

224

detection and survey data reported during an experiment with the test center’s record of the

225

experiment. The maintenance record documented the list of controlled releases or periods to

226

be excluded from the result analysis, either because the controlled release was non-compliant

227

with the testing protocol or due to an unplanned release (i.e., venting an emission point gas

228

supply line). The result of the detection classification process involving pairing controlled

229

releases with detection reports, as summarized in SI Section S-4, was used to evaluate the

230

performance metrics in sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the protocol. Key performance metrics for

231

this study are summarized below:

232

• Probability of Detection (POD): This represents the probability of detecting an emis-

233

sion over a set of environmental and measurement conditions (e.g., wind speed, emission

234

rate, release duration, etc.). This is evaluated as the fraction of the count of true posi-

235

tive (TP) detections to the sum of the counts of TP and false negative (FN) detections

236

over a set of conditions as shown in equation 1.

Where x is the set of measurement conditions at which the POD is assessed at.

equipment unit, equipment group, and facility levels, respectively.

246

• Localization Accuracy (Equipment Unit): This is the fraction of detection reports at

247

each localization precision level (equipment unit) or better as shown in equations 4, 5,

Participating Solutions

252

Participating solutions were selected through contacts in the PDC and an open invitation

253

advertised on METEC’s website. Twelve survey solutions were tested for the first time

254

under the protocol at different times within the study period, with three solutions tested

255

again within 2 months to 1 year of their initial tests. Solutions were required to deploy

256

as they would in actual field measurement campaigns (i.e., number of personnel, survey

257

speed/pace, survey height/distance, etc.). Solutions provided all auxiliary equipment (e.g.,

258

anemometers, battery packs, power cables, internet connection, etc.) needed to perform

259

emissions survey during testing. The list of participating solutions arranged in alphabetical

260

order is as follows: ABB HoverGuard, ABB MicroGuard, ABB MobileGuard, ChampionX

261

AURA OGI, Cimarex FLIR OGI, Cimarex Ventus, Distran Ultra, Heath EyeCGas, Heath

262

RMLD-CS, Konica Minolta GMP02, Montrose Pergam Laser Falcon, and Xplorobot Laser

263

OGI. Given the confidentiality agreement between the study team and the solutions, solutions

264

were identified with arbitrarily selected, unique alphabetic identifiers.

265

For this study, participating survey solutions were grouped into three categories:

266

1. Mobile solutions: Survey solutions that are automobile- and unmanned aerial vehicle

267

(UAV)/drone-based.

268

2. Handheld OGI solutions: Traditional handheld OGI camera solutions.

269

3. Advanced handheld solutions: Includes other handheld solutions that do not detect

270

emissions using OGI technology alone (if at all). These include sensing techniques

271

like acoustic sensing, infrared absorption spectroscopy, tunable diode laser absorption

272

spectroscopy (TDLAS) technology, etc.

273

Table 1 summarizes the solutions that participated in the study with their deployment

274

characteristics and selected test conditions. While all solutions tested detection and source

275

localization capabilities, only solutions A and G quantified emissions. The SI contains reports

276

that comprehensively describes all the tested capabilities evaluated for each solution.

Study Limitations

278

The limitations of the test center in comparison to actual onshore production O&G facilities

279

have been extensively discussed by Zimmerle et al. and Ilonze et al.. In summary, the test

280

center represents near-ideal operational field conditions with little ongoing operational ac-

281

tivity that produces vibration, noise, heated sources, etc. For this testing, baseline emissions

282

– commonly defined as routine, planned emissions, including combustion slip, gas pneumat-

283

ics, periodic venting, and similar sources - were not included. As a result, certain failure

284

conditions, such as a gas pneumatic venting in excess of designed rates, were not included

285

as potential sources. Also, controlled testing may not completely capture the performance

286

of solutions at actual O&G facilities, as Day et al. demonstrated for continuous monitors.

287

The emissions scenarios simulated for this study did not include large emission rate events,

288

often responsible for a highly skewed share of total emission rates at O&G facilities. 21,24–27

289

This limitation was intentional. The objective of the study was to characterize the POD of

290

solutions, and since all solutions tested here have a high probability of detecting emitters in

291

excess of 3 kg/h, testing at higher rates provides little additional information. Additionally,

292

the US EPA OOOO(b) regulation 52 was not published prior to these tests, therefore testing

293

was not targeted at the rates specified in that regulation.

294

The test results described here are for integrated solutions, consisting of the sensor, de-

295

ployment method, and analytics. Field and regulatory application of these results should

296

not apply results from one solution developer to another using the same sensor and de-

297

ployment method, as differences in analytics may produce significant differences in solution

298

performance. As with other testing programs, 42,43 classification of excess or redundant TP

299

detections (detections identifying controlled releases that have been matched already, as new

300

and/or different emitters) for any single controlled release may be interpreted in multiple

301

ways. Since close-range survey solutions (e.g., handheld emissions detection technologies) are

302

generally used for follow-up investigations due to their high localization precision, a surveyor

303

could interpret an extra detection report that incorrectly identified emissions (using GPS

304

coordinates, etc.) from a component some distance from an actual emitter as an FP detec-

305

tion. Conversely, in a different application, such an extra report might not be considered an

306

FP detection if it correctly attributes emission to the emitting equipment unit. Given these

307

possible interpretations of redundant TP detections, Table S-7 in the SI breaks down the

308

FPF of solutions shown in Table 2 into FPs due to (1) no-ongoing controlled releases, and

309

(2) redundant TP detections. See Bell et al. for other potential limitations of the protocol’s

310

detection classification scheme.

Data Analysis

312

To evaluate the POD curves of solutions, three curve-fitting models (power function, binary

313

logistic regression function, and exponential function) were assessed and compared using the

314

resulting data of the detection classification framework. The exponential function (equa-

315

tion 7) was selected for two reasons. First, in several cases, the binary logistic regression

316

function predicted non-zero POD at zero controlled release rates, which is unrealistic (see

317

Bell et al.). Second, there were insufficient experimental points to bin data as required for a

318

power curve fit as used in other studies (e.g. Zimmerle et al., Ilonze et al.). For the solutions

319

tested, the range of valid classified data (TP and FN) points for each solution was 70 to

320

224, with 11 of the 15 solutions controlled testing producing less than 120 data points. The

321

exponential link function selected was:
pod = 1 − exp(−a · xb ) a,b are curve fitting parameters

(7)

322

The curve fitting parameters for the POD curve (equation 7) were selected using least squares

323

methods (SI Section S-3). The original data was bootstrapped 500 times to generate the

324

uncertainty on any POD curve, with the 95% empirical confidence interval (CI) captured

325

as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. The study used 4 statistical tests to evaluate statistical

326

significance in terms of correlation between 2 variables (Rank-Biseral correlations) and the

327

difference between groups (2-sample T-test, Mann-Whitney U, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov

328

tests) as described in SI section S-3.

329

Results and Discussions

330

This section covers results and discussions about solutions’ performance and change in per-

331

formance (i.e., for solutions that tested multiple times) based on the following metrics:

332

probability of detection, emission source localization, and survey time. Analysis on emis-

333

sions quantification performance was excluded as only two solutions tested that capability

334

over two different rounds of testing. However, quantification performance and other metrics

335

not captured in this paper are summarized in each solution’s test report attached with the

336

SI.

337

Handheld OGI Camera Solutions vs Other Categories of Solutions

338

Overall, handheld OGI camera solutions had comparable or better performance than other

339

solution categories across most metrics assessed. Figures 1, 2, and 3 shows the POD curves of

340

solutions as a function of controlled release rate. A multivariable logistic regression analysis

341

evaluating the impact of release rate, wind speed, wind direction, and ambient temperature

342

on the emissions detectability (TP and FN classification → POD) of solutions indicated

343

that emission rate was statistically significant (p < 0.05) for 5 (C, D, E, H, and J) of

344

12 solutions that tested in the first round (SI Table S-4). Other variables (temperature,

345

wind speed, and wind direction) were separately statistically significant to just one solution

346

each. Measurement conditions like survey height and speed were not input parameters in

347

evaluating the POD curves of solutions since they were either approximately constant during

348

each solution’s survey or were not documented by the surveyors. The POD curves of solutions

349

characterized the likelihood of detecting emission at various release rates over a wide range

350

of environmental conditions.

351

In Figures 1, 2 and 3, for each solution that tested twice (A, H, and K), the POD curves

352

from all rounds of testing are shown in one plot to facilitate performance comparison. Each

353

curve is identified by the year of testing (2021, 2022, or 2023) and the round of testing for

354

a solution during the year (first round — 1 or second round — 2). Similar to Bell et al.

355

and Ilonze et al., this study evaluated the detection sensitivity of solutions by defining each

356

solution’s detection limit (DL90) as the minimum emission rate the solution can detect 90%

357

of the time across multiple observations over a wide range of weather conditions (i.e., the

358

emission rate the solution has 90% POD). The lower the DL90, the more likely a solution

359

detects a wider range of emission rates at O&G facilities, although the desired DL90 depends

360

on field application. For solutions intended for follow-up investigations and fugitive emissions

361

detections, their DL90 should be significantly lower than those used for screening purposes.

for all handheld OGI camera solutions. The blue and green colors illustrate POD curves from
the first round of tests conducted in 2021 and 2023. The DL90 is the emission rate at which
the solution achieves 90% POD. The uncertainty on the POD curve is illustrated by a cloud
of curves obtained through bootstrapping, with the confidence interval evaluated as the 2.5
and 97.5 percentiles. The value "NA" is given when the DL90 or the associated uncertainty
is more than ×20 the maximum release rate tested or cannot be evaluated. A scatter plot
with circular markers shows binary detection classification results: TP detections (1) and
FN detections (0). The upper limit of the x-axis has been trimmed at 0.7 kg CH4 /h to
maintain the same axis limit for all solutions.

Of the 5 solutions whose emissions detectability (i.e., POD) was statistically influenced by

release rate, only solution D did not have a statistically significant correlation (Rank-Biseral

364

correlation, p < 0.05) between release rate and emissions detectability (SI Section S-7.1).

365

This suggests that the solution’s POD curve will likely benefit from accounting for windspeed

366

(which was statistically significant to the solution’s emissions detectability), as shown in SI

367

Figure S-7. Similarly, the POD curves of the remaining (7 of 12) solutions that were not

368

statistically influenced by release rate, wind speed, or/and temperature may significantly

369

depend on other factors that could not be investigated (out of scope) in this study, like

370

variations in the survey (driving/flight) speed, height/distance from leak source, etc. For

371

example, von Fischer et al. showed that detection limits of automobile-based solutions tend

372

to increase with measurement distance. Results also indicated that the POD curves (i.e.,

373

the best estimate curve with the lower and upper confidence limit curves obtained through

374

bootstrapping as shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3) of all but solutions J and D (with that of

375

A and I unclear) agree closely with the curves obtained by scaling POD curves normalized

376

by windspeed by the mean, minimum, and maximum wind speed tested for each solution

377

(SI Figures S-8, S-9, and S-10). This result suggests that the POD curves of most of the

378

tested solutions (especially OGI camera solutions) can also be approximately expressed as a

379

function of emission rate normalized by windspeed as shown in SI Figures S-5, S-6, and S-7.

380

In general, Figures 1, 2, and 3, and Table 2 shows that the POD curves of solutions could

381

only predict the DL90 of 7 of 12 solutions with values ranging from 0.08 [0.00, 0.10] kg CH4 /h

382

to 0.81 [0.16, NA] kg CH4 /h with 6 solutions within their tested emission rate range. The

383

five solutions that could not predict their respective DL90s or had large DL90 values (> 70×)

384

relative to the maximum release rates tested consisted of all 4 mobile solutions (drone- and

385

automobile-based) tested in the study. Table 2 also shows that mobile solutions had some of

386

the largest FPF (19.2% to 50.0%) and FNF (20.3% to 48.5%) values evaluated in this study.

387

This result is likely due to potential difficulties at either distinguishing methane (or other

388

gas species of interest) signals from background noise by these solutions (increases FPF),

389

high detection limits (increases FNF), or redundant TP detections due to the limitations of

390

the test protocol (inflates FPF) (SI Table S-7).

391

The DL90s of 3 of the 4 handheld OGI camera solutions tested were among the top 4

392

lowest DL90s obtained in the study. Unlike advanced handheld solutions, emission rate and

393

other test conditions were not statistically significant to the emissions detectability of the 3

394

camera solutions which aligns with data from Zimmerle et al. that showed that the experience

395

level of an OGI camera surveyor had a more statistically significant impact on emissions

396

detection rate than other variables tested. Similarly, Ravikumar et al. identified the distance

397

between an OGI camera and a leak source as the most important parameter affecting the

398

detection effectiveness of handheld OGI camera solutions. 54 Since solution vendors conducted

399

the emissions surveys in this study, it is likely that surveyors sent by the solutions were highly

400

experienced and used that expertise to maximize solution performance; Deployment of the

401

same solutions in field conditions may not have access to this level of experience. Advanced

402

handheld solutions use instruments that measure ambient emission concentration (like mobile

403

solutions) but are close enough to sources that there is less dependence on favorable plume

404

transport (unlike mobile solutions). As a result, the POD of advanced handeld solutions is

405

dependent on emission rate for 3 of the 4 advanced handheld solutions tested.

406

Additionally, handheld OGI camera solutions had the lowest FPF values in the study

407

(0.0% to 4.3%) which were statistically significantly lower (T and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests;

408

P< 0.05) than that of mobile solutions but comparable to advanced handheld solutions (4.8%

409

to 35.6%). Although the FNF values of 2 of 4 handheld OGI camera solutions were less than

410

10%, the FNF values of handheld OGI camera solutions were not statistically different from

411

that of mobile and advanced handheld solutions, respectively.

While these results highlight why handheld OGI camera solutions are typically used,

413

and are anecdotally effective, for follow-up investigations and regulatory-compliant LDAR

414

inspections at O&G facilities, results also showed that the DL90s of all advanced handheld

415

solutions were within the minimum detection threshold stipulated in the EPA’s final rule

416

(NSPS OOOO(b) rules) for quarterly monitoring (≤ 1 kg CH4 /h) of well sites and centralized

417

production facilities with alternative technologies. 13 For reference, see SI Figures S-11, S-12,

418

and S-13 for POD curves and DL90s derived using the power function, and SI Figures S-14,

S-15, and S-16 for POD curves and DL90s based on binary logistic regression for all solutions.

statistically significantly (T and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; p< 0.05) higher than those of

425

mobile solutions, with the two categories of handheld solutions having comparable localiza-

427

(13m2 to 88m2 ) more than handheld solutions (SI Table S-8 and Figure S-18). These find-

ings highlight the effectiveness of handheld solutions at pinpointing leak sources for repairs

or reporting, even though cost and labor requirements are major concerns when scaled over

430

thousands of O&G facilities. Also, solutions showed a similar trend in localization precision

performance as observed for localization accuracy (SI Table S-8 and Figure S-17).

One explanation for the localization performance of mobile solutions is that their data

433

analytics typically requires favorable wind conditions - accessed directly downwind, steady

434

wind direction and speed, well understood stability class - and an accurate estimate of the

435

emission location. Understanding of wind would be improved by averaging over enough time

436

to extract both mean and variability in wind direction, and to estimate stability parameters.

437

However, qualitative observation of solution methods indicate that during this study, most

438

methods did not measure long enough to extract average wind conditions from data, as the

439

selling point of the method is providing faster screening of facilities.

440

Although some mobile solutions in this study presented promising equipment unit-level

441

localization performance (accuracy and precision > 50% and 60%, respectively), with addi-

442

tional development, mobile solutions may currently be best deployed to rapidly screen for

443

general emissions locations, followed by investigations with handheld solutions (e.g., OGI

444

camera surveys) to identify emitters for repairs and reporting. In some field applications,

445

a high spatial resolution of detected sources might be less of a priority than the ability to

446

screen a large area at a time with less labor compared to surveying with handheld solutions. 12

447

For regulatory compliance, the EPA’s final rule on advanced methane detection technologies

448

has stipulated secondary inspection work practices at O&G facilities based on the spatial

449

resolution of emission sources by LDAQ solutions. 13

450

To characterize the time expended by solutions to complete emissions survey during

451

each experiment, reported survey times by solutions were normalized by the number of

452

equipment units (wellheads, separators, and tanks) in the survey areas (which are unequal

453

in size) defined by the study team during experiments, as summarized in Table 2 and Figure

454

5. Each violin plot in Figure 5 represents the distribution of the survey times per equipment

455

unit for each solution. While the face color of each violin indicate if a solution is categorized

456

as mobile, handheld OGI, or advanced handheld, the edge color shows if the result is from the

457

first or second round of testing of the solution. From Table 2 and Figure 5, results show that

458

the survey times per unit for mobile solutions as a group were statistically significantly lower

459

(Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; p< 0.05) lower than those of handheld

460

OGI and advanced handheld solutions, respectively, even though there were no statistically

461

significant difference between the 2 categories of handheld solutions. Faster survey times,

462

as suggested by Fox et al., have important cost implications during field deployments; the

463

longer it takes to complete surveys, the more likely it is to increase an operator’s emissions

464

monitoring expenses when scaled over several O&G facilities.

Figure 5: A violin plot showing the distribution of survey time per equipment unit arranged
in increasing order of solutions’ first-round testing mean survey times. The survey time
per equipment unit was evaluated by dividing the survey time by the number of equipment
units in the survey areas (as defined by the test center) within which an experiment was
conducted. The face color of each violin indicates if a solution is a mobile (i.e., vehicleor drone-based), a handheld OGI, or an advanced handheld solution. The violin whiskers
represent the minimum and maximum survey times per equipment unit, while the blue
(dashed) and orange (solid) lines indicate the median and mean survey times per equipment
unit, respectively. The results of solutions that have been tested twice (A, H, and K) are
also compared; second test results are differentiated from the first round test results by the
edge color of each violin plot. The violins for the first round results have red edge colors
while those for the second round have a dark slate gray color.

465

While mobile solutions had quicker survey times per equipment unit as a group compared

466

to handheld solutions, the reverse was true for a few individual solutions. We hypothesize

467

this was due to a few reasons. First, the noticeable odor and the audible sound made by gas

468

releases during this study could have unblinded some controlled releases in some cases (e.g.,

469

surveyors directly downwind of an emission source) and likely aided surveyors with handheld

470

technologies in narrowing down leak locations quicker than expected. Although this survey

471

behavior is also observed in real facilities, the test facility in this study (METEC) is not

472

characterized by O&G facility sensory distractions, which could make emissions survey more

473

challenging. Real O&G facilities are typically characterized by operational noise (e.g., the

474

movement of trucks or other vibrational noise sources) or background emissions due to rou-

475

tine venting events (i.e., from gas-driven pneumatic controllers and pumps, compressor seals,

476

etc.), which can produce misleading auditory and olfactory signals to surveyors, thereby in-

477

creasing the survey times with these solutions in the field. Second, there were cases where

478

surveys with drone-based solutions were suspended midway through flights to replace flat

479

batteries or to fix impromptu operational challenges like poor wireless communication be-

480

tween the drone system and the controller. It was, however, difficult to assess the extent to

481

which these breaks between flights (if at all) increased the survey times due to unavailable

482

data.

483

Results also showed that for the range of survey times per equipment unit obtained in

484

this study, the TPFs evaluated per experiment did not statistically significantly correlate

485

(SI section S-7.4) with the associated survey times per equipment unit (except for solu-

486

tion I). This indicates that high TP detection performance is possible at relatively shorter

487

survey times if solutions’ survey methodologies are optimized, weather and environmental

488

conditions are favorable (i.e., wind, road accessibility, etc.), and solutions are at high readi-

489

ness level for field deployment. In general, this study’s detection, localization, and survey

490

times data indicate that tested mobile and handheld solutions likely should have different

491

value propositions: perform quicker surveys and narrow down emission sources with mobile

492

solutions to facilitate closer inspections and measurement with handheld solutions - which

493

showed better detection and localization performance.

494

How Solutions’ Performance Changed with Repeat Testing

495

Our data showed that solutions’ performance tends to improve with repeat testing. Three

496

solutions (A, H, and K) participated in the second round of testing 3 to 12 months af-

497

ter they tested for the first time at the same facility with the same protocol. Our data

498

indicate that the performance of solutions H and K generally improved across all metrics

499

(i.e., DL90, FPF, FNF, equipment unit level localization accuracy and precision, and sur-

500

vey time per equipment unit) except localization precision for solution K. In contrast, the

501

performance of solution A declined across all metrics except for localization accuracy and

502

precision. These improvements are unsurprising as there has been rapid and continued devel-

503

opment of next-generation emissions detection technologies in terms of sensor type/quality,

504

hardware, data analytics/algorithms, and survey methodology given the growing interest

505

in advanced methane detection technologies by operators and regulators. 13,43 For example,

506

solution H maintained 100% localization precision at the equipment unit level (as with the

507

first round test result) while also increasing localization accuracy to 98%, suggesting likely

508

near-maturity of the solution’s localization algorithm.

509

Other possible reasons for the improvement (or lack thereof) in the performance of so-

510

lutions include relatively favorable (or unfavorable) test and measurement conditions. For

511

example, Solutions A and K were retested in December 2022 (SI section S-2) under tem-

512

perature conditions between 3°C and 11°C compared to 8°C and 22°C in 2021 during the

513

first round of testing. Surveyors with solution A (i.e., automobile-based) are less likely to

514

be adversely influenced by relatively cold weather, unlike solution K (i.e., handheld), since

515

the latter’s operationalization involves direct inspection of suspected leaking components.

516

This hypothesis is further supported by solution K recording the lowest survey times per

517

equipment unit obtained throughout the study during the second round of testing. Secondly,

518

some solutions might have improved their survey methodology or the implementation pro-

519

cess. For example, solution K’s walking procedure in the last test was a modified version of

520

the one they used in the first round of testing (see reports attached with the SI).

521

Sensitivity of Solution’s Detection Performance to Testing Complex-

522

ity

523

Study data showed that the detection capacity of mobile solutions was generally more sensi-

524

tive to changes in testing complexity than other solution categories. Recall that experiments

525

conducted during this study had 1 to 6 simultaneous controlled releases from different emis-

526

sions sources of different heights. Results show that mobile solutions had more difficulty

527

isolating and detecting individual emissions during experiments with multiple controlled re-

528

leases than other categories of solutions. More mobile solutions (2 of 4) had statistically

529

significant (Rank Biseral Correlation; p< 0.05) lower TPF per experiment for experiments

530

with multiple controlled releases compared to experiments with 1 controlled release (SI sec-

531

tion S-7.5). Additionally, there were statistically significant differences between the TPFs of

532

mobile solutions and handheld (i.e., OGI and advanced) solutions for all experiments with

533

multiple controlled releases, unlike when experiments with 1 controlled release were consid-

534

ered. These results highlight a key issue generally encountered by solutions that rely on wind

535

transport to make detections (i.e., mobile solutions and continuous monitors): the struggle

536

by solutions’ data analytics and algorithms to robustly isolate and differentiate individual

537

emission sources during experiments with multiple, simultaneous controlled releases. 32,42,43

538

When controlled releases for solutions were aggregated based on emission point heights

539

by generally categorizing them as tank (height > 12 ft) and non-tank (< 12 ft) sources,

540

our data showed that no group of solutions showed a statistically significant difference in

541

the TPFs between the source categories. However, handheld solutions showed statistically

542

significantly higher TPF for tank sources than mobile solutions (2 sample t-tests; p< 0.05),

543

which is unsurprising given that handheld solutions involved close component-level emissions

544

inspections, unlike mobile solutions, which were typically positioned farther away from the

545

emission source (e.g., the edge of a well pad). Note that in several field cases, direct, prox-

546

imity surveys of emitting sources can be challenging due to inaccessibility, high-temperature

547

surfaces, or moving parts; hence, such scenarios might require alternative emissions measure30

548

ment methods such as mobile solutions. Therefore, users must understand the limitations of

549

solutions, consider if a solution is fit for purpose for an application during field deployment

550

(i.e., facility-level emissions screening, component-level inspection, etc.), and assess how the

551

trade-offs in the performance of the different categories of solutions can be leveraged for

552

effective emissions mitigation.

553

Implications

554

Recent rules and regulatory policies, such as the US EPA final NSPS rules on alternative

555

methane detection approaches 13 and the Inflation Reduction Act Waste Emission Charge 55

556

aimed at further reduction in methane emissions across the US O&G supply chain, have

557

spurred increased attention to advanced emissions detection solutions. With standardized

558

controlled testing identified as one of the steps involved in demonstrating emissions mitigation

559

equivalence between these solutions and traditional LDAR approaches, 29,31 this study, unlike

560

prior works, 31,32,37 represents a significant step forward in the controlled testing of next-

561

generation survey solutions using a consensus test protocol. 38

562

The study results have shown the following: First, while handheld OGI camera solutions

563

had comparable or better performance than other categories of solutions across most per-

564

formance metrics, no solution or category of solutions achieved all the desired performance

565

levels across all metrics assessed. This implies that no category of solutions tested is su-

566

perior as all solutions can systematically detect emissions successfully (atleast significantly

567

better than random guessing as shown in SI section S-7.5), albeit with varying strengths and

568

limitations hence the need for different value propositions for mobile solutions and handheld

569

solutions.

570

Secondly, solutions’ performance tends to improve with repeat testing, which highlights

571

the importance of regular, comprehensive testing to the development of solutions, as shown

572

in a prior similar study. 43 Regular and robust controlled testing provide quality ground

573

truth data used by solutions to optimize sensor performance and algorithms, and evaluate

574

survey/deployment methodology and the implementation processes for easier interpretation

575

in the field and improved detection performance

576

Finally, isolating and differentiating individual sources from multiple, simultaneous emit-

577

ters is still a persistent challenge for the data analytics/algorithm of solutions that gener-

578

ally rely on wind transport for detection (i.e., mobile solutions, continuous monitors, etc.).

579

However, given the rapid development of advanced methane detection technologies, there is

580

potential that this challenge could be addressed significantly in the near future.

581

This study’s results should be applied with caution for two reasons. First, since the test

582

facility used for the study mimics near-ideal real facility operational conditions, solutions’

583

results likely represent best-case scenario performance (unless detection performance depends

584

on high thermal contrast between the equipment surface and the gas plume). Second, as

585

shown by Day et al. for continuous monitors, field testing performance can vary substantially

586

from that of controlled testing; therefore, robust field testing of the solutions is needed to

587

validate and build confidence in assessed controlled testing performances.
