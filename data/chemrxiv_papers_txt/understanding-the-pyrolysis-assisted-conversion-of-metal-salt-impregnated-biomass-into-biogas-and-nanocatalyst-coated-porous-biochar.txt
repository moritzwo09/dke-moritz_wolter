Abstract
Slow pyrolysis is the most employed technique to design biochar at high yield. It is
particularly suitable for converting impregnated biomass into biochar-immobilized
nanocatalysts. The latter exhibits a porous structure compared to pristine biochar.
However, this distinct behavior is yet to be understood. To this end, the coupled
technique of Thermogravimetric Analysis/Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(TGA/FTIR) was used to simulate pyrolysis in a tube furnace for biochar production
and to analyze syngas. Sugarcane bagasse (SCPB) powder, treated with copper and/or
nickel nitrates, was pyrolyzed in a TGA under nitrogen at heating rates from RT to
500 ¬∞C for 1 hour. TGA/DTG permitted monitoring the thermal events of SCPB which
was found to be exacerbated by the introduction of metals. The syngases, including
COx, NOx, HNO3, and H2O, were effectively detected and analyzed by FTIR during
the pyrolysis process at varying heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 ¬∞C/min. Notably,
Ni(NO3)2.6H2O yielded N2O, probably associated with the formation of a biochar
porous structure. The pyrolysis activation energies (Ea) of SCPB and SCPB/CuNi were
determined using FWO and DAEM models. The maximum weight loss was found to
occur at a thermochemical conversion of ~60% into char; and Ea = 234 kJ.mol-1 for
SCPB, much higher than 90 kJ.mol-1 obtained for the wet impregnated sample
SCPB/nitrates; hence the dramatic effect of the nanometal precursors on the pyrolysis
process. XPS analysis demonstrated that TG-biochar and ‚Äútubular furnace‚Äù biochar
exhibit identical surface chemical compositions. Raman spectroscopy brought evidence
for graphitic carbon structure as judged from D and G bands in SCPB/CuNi.
Microscopic observations confirmed a well-defined porous morphology.
From the above, this TG-FTIR study permitted to highlight the central role of copper
and particularly nickel in the pyrolysis process. These metals:
-significantly lower the pyrolysis activation energy
- induce porous structure of the underlying biochar
-could be added to the repertoire of activators, dominated by ZnCl2 and FeCl3.
-serve as activators

Introduction
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a shared blueprint for peace
and prosperity for people and the planet[1,2]. Amid growing concerns over energy and
environmental challenges, the development of emerging materials and clean fuels has
been recognized as major contributors to environmental remediation[3,4]. In recent
years, biomass has emerged as a promising, sustainable, and environmentally friendly
precursor[5]. Agricultural waste is one of the abundant yet underutilized resource of
biomass[6]. Certain types of agricultural byproducts, such as peapod peel[7], corn
straw[8], and sugarcane pulp bagasse[9], are rich in cellulose, and their high yield and
carbon content make them suitable feedstocks for renewable energy production.
Converting biomass energy into valuable products is an effective and sustainable way
to address the problems of energy shortage and waste abundance[10].
Pyrolysis, a thermochemical process conducted under specific conditions, is widely
used to transform biomass into various valuable products. Depending on the heating
rate, biomass pyrolysis can be categorized into slow pyrolysis (primarily yielding gas
or char) and fast pyrolysis (aimed at producing bio-oil) [11-13]. Among the pyrolysis
products, biochar has garnered significant attention, involving heating biomass to
moderate temperatures in an oxygen-free or low-oxygen environment[14]. Biochar is a
sustainable carbon-rich solid material of interest in energy storage[15] and
environmental remediation[16,17]. Over the recent years, it emerged as remarkable,
renewable support of nanocatalysts, and an excellent alternative to the classical
supports silica, alumina, and zeolite[18,19]. The composition of biochar derived from
biomass thermochemical conversion mainly depends on the initial composition of the
feedstock in cellulose-, lignin-, hemicellulose-, protein- and chitin [20].
The addition of mono- and bimetallic catalysts during synthesis has been shown to
enhance pyrolysis efficiency and product quality (e.g., biochar yield, porous structure)
[21,22], with examples including Mg [23], Cu[24], Co-Ni[25], Mn/Co[26], and Mg/Fe
[27]. Towards this end, wet impregnation of the raw biomass with catalyst precursors
is an efficient and simple method of creating metal-loaded biochar composites by
pyrolysis [28,29]. This approach enhances the dispersion on- and bonding of the

nanometals to the biochar matrix and promote the formation of porous structures during
the subsequent carbonization process[30].
Another noteworthy aspect, syngas, kind of simultaneous product of biomass
thermochemical conversion, can be effectively detected and collected, which might be
another benefit for gaseous fuel and reaction atmosphere [31,32]. In this regard,
commonly used model-free methods for the decomposition mechanisms and kinetics of
lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis, are highly effective for determining the activation
energies [33,34].
To elucidate the relationship between the syngas generated and the formation of porous
biochar structure, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR) was employed to simulate the pyrolysis process. While
TGA provides insights into the decomposition and weight loss of biomass as a function
of temperature, FT-IR enables continuous analysis of gases released during the
process[35]. Monitoring the weight loss versus time and temperature permits to
determination of pyrolysis activation energy using appropriate kinetic models [36].
This study aims to analyze the pyrolysis of SCPB biomass impregnated with metallic
salts, and to understand the development of porous biochar-metal composites at
different pyrolytic parameters; and detect the generation of syngas during the thermochemical transformation. Specifically, a series of experiments were conducted to
(1) Examine the development of pore structure of biochar with different amounts of
metal nanoparticles (Cu, Ni, and CuNi) and different heating rates (10, 20, and
30 ‚ÑÉ/min);
(2) Explore the composition of the released syngas in this process.
(3) Reveal the thermal transformation process using a kinetic model, activation energy
calculation, and elemental analysis.

Despite the publication of several articles on the TGA study of the thermochemical
conversion of biomass into biochar, to the best of our knowledge, such an investigation
has never concerned biomass impregnated with copper and/or nickel salts. For this

reason, we were motivated to employ TGA to understand the formation of porous
biochar-supported nanocatalysts [37,38] by the direct pyrolysis of biomass impregnated
with metal nanocatalyst precursors. Not only these salts provide immobilized
nanocatalysts but also induce the formation of a remarkable fishnet porous structure of
the underlying biochar.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample preparation
The sugarcane pulp bagasse (SCPB) utilized in this study was collected from Eygpt.
The SCPB was crushed and then milled to fine powder for pyrolysis experiments.
Copper nitrate, nickel nitrate and their mixture were employed respectively to wet
impregnation process in distilled water, the mass ratio sets in 0.5 mmol of metal nitrate
per gram of biomass, which named SCPB/Cu, SCPB/Ni and SCPB/CuNi.

2.2. TGA-FTIR of SCPB-based samples
A Setaram Labsysevo apparatus was used under nitrogen atmosphere, and coupled with
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Thermoscientific Is 10) to detect gaseous
products.
The blank experiments were performed before each test to ensure accuracy. SCPBbased samples were exposed to constant temperatures over time and N2 ensured inert
conditions before testing. The furnace temperature was raised to the target pyrolysis
temperature from RT to 500 ¬∞C. The heating rate was set between 10 and 30 ¬∞C/min,
and the final temperature was maintained for 1 h. After cooling to RT at the end of the
experiment, biochar samples were collected for further analysis.

For each test, the TG curve (mass loss curve) and the derivative mass loss curve (DTG)
were monitored and calculated as the indicator of the mass loss ratio and the
endothermicity, as defined by Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, respectively.

M0 and MT represent the initial mass and the residual mass of the sample at temperature

2.3. Kinetics modeling
The Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method and the distributed activation energy model
(DAEM) were applied for fitting pyrolysis kinetics and determining the pyrolysis
activation energy (Ea) at different conversion rates [34,39,40]. These methods are the
most employed due to their reliability.

The FWO and DAEM methods are expressed by the following Eq. (3-4):

The degree of conversion rates Œ± was calculated using the following Eq. (5):

Œ±=

where w0, wf and wt are the mass of the sample at the initial, final, and time t stages,
respectively (mg). Œ≤ is the heating rate (K/min), R is the universal gas constant (8.315
J/mol¬∑K), T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin (K), A is the pre-exponential factor
(min‚àí1), and E is the activation energy (kJ/mol).
The corresponding activation energy Ea was obtained from the slope of the line plotted
by ln(Œ≤)and ln(Œ≤/T2) versus 1/T in the conversion rate Œ±. This linear fitting approach
allows for accurate activation energy calculation, at different stages of the pyrolysis
process, reflecting how the energy requirements change as the reaction progresses.

2.4. Characterization of the biochar products
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed using a K Alpha+

apparatus (Thermo, East Grinstead, UK), fitted with a mono Al KÔÅ° (source energy =
1486.6 eV) and a flood gun for charge compensation. Avantage software version 6.8.0
was used for data acquisition and processing. The pass energy was set at 80 and 200 eV
for the narrow regions, and the survey spectra, respectively. The surface chemical
composition was determined using the manufacturer‚Äôs sensitivity factors.
Raman spectra of the samples were acquired using a Horiba HR Evo Nano, a highresolution Raman microspectrometer. The excitation source was a 473 nm laser. The
laser was focused onto the samples using a 100x long-distance objective (N.A. = 0.9),
which allows for high spatial resolution when the experiments were performed in air.
The spectrometer was coupled to the microscope, enabling precise localization of the
measurement points to ensure high signal-to-noise ratios for reliable analysis.

our previous research on SCPB biomass as the feedstock, catalyst precursors (copper
nitrate and nickel nitrate) were loaded onto the biomass using the wet impregnation
method[37]. During the subsequent pyrolysis process, the pyrolysis temperature of
500 ¬∞C was found to be optimal for catalytic activity and energy efficiency[41]. For
analyzing the thermal degradation of SCPB residues, both with and without catalyst
precursors, the heating ramp rate was set to 10, 20, and 30 ¬∞C/min, and the generated
biochar as the solid product was probed ex-situ by XPS and Raman spectroscopy,
whereas the syngas were collected during pyrolysis and analyzed in-situ by the FTIR
detector.

The thermal decomposition behaviors of SCPB, CuNi, and SCPB/CuNi composites
revealed distinct characteristics shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. SCPB exhibited multistage decomposition, with water evaporation, hemicellulose degradation, cellulose
breakdown, and gradual lignin decomposition contributing to biochar formation[42].
CuNi underwent three stages: crystalline water release, nitrate decomposition to
HNO3[43], and conversion of metal ions to oxides[43], leaving a stable residual mass.

In Fig. 2a, the TGA/DTG/DSC curves show the characteristic thermal degradation of
SCPB. Initially, SCPB experiences a mass loss of 2.9% at 155 ¬∞C, which is attributed
to the volatilization of the organic content. Subsequently, about 17.5% of the mass is
lost at 285 ¬∞C due to the degradation of unstable organic components, such as
hemicellulose and carbohydrates[44]. At 336 ¬∞C, the initial mass of the biochar is
further lost by 32.2%, which is mainly due to the degradation of cellulose[45]. Beyond
425 ¬∞C, the decomposition of refractory organic carbon (mainly lignin) occurs. In the
presence of metal salts copper nitrate and nickel nitrate, the degradation of biochar
occurred uniformly between 150 and 480 ¬∞C (Figure 2b), the pyrolysis plot of
SCPB/CuNi is more similar to that of pure SCPB. This suggests that, while the addition
of CuNi did not change the overall behavior significantly, it did affect the maximum
mass loss rate, as shown in the corresponding DTG derivative (Fig. S1): SCPB/CuNi
composite peaks at 328 ¬∞C, which is 10 ¬∞C lower than pure SCPB (338 ¬∞C) and 5 ¬∞C
higher than CuNi (323 ¬∞C). Compared with the pure SCPB, the DTG curve of
SCPB/CuNi showed that CuNi reduced the degradation temperature of biomass, while
improving the degradation rate and gas release to form special products.
Heat flow analysis of SCPB precursor and SCPB treated with metal salts showed that
there was an interaction between metals and biochar (Fig. 2a-b red line). The
endothermic peak of biochar (180 ¬∞C) was retained by SCPB/CuNi, while some of the
peaks also changed. The presence of these thermal events and the exo/endothermic drift
may support the existence of electrostatic or metal exchange interactions between metal
ions and functional groups on the surface of biochar[44].

From the TG/DTG curves vs pyrolysis time in Fig.3, which can be seen that the mass
of the pure biochar SCPBB and biochar composite SCPBB/CuNi remain stable after 1h
at 500 ¬∞C under TG pyrolysis, with a residual content of ~24% and ~27%, respectively.
To further evaluate the interactions between CuNi and SCPB during the thermal
reaction, the theoretical mass loss of the blend (SCPB/CuNi-t) was calculated as the
weighted average of the individual mass losses of CuNi and SCPB. This approach
assumed no synergistic effects between the two components. The theoretical mass loss
is expressed according to Eq.(6) [46]:

WSCPB/CuNi-t=RCuNi √ó WCuNi + RSCPB √ó WSCPB

RCuNi and RSCPB are the weight rates of CuNi and SCPB in the SCPB/CuNi composite.

values confirmed the presence of synergistic interactions between SCPB and CuNi
during the thermal behavior. Therefore, it is noteworthy that loading metal ions into
SCPB biomass material dramatically affected the pyrolysis of the latter, resulting in the
formation of a porous structure for the biochar/metal composites.

3.3. Analysis of the released gases
The product distribution of SCPB-based materials during pyrolysis under N2
atmosphere has been investigated by a hyphenated platform TG-FTIR, revealing their
interactions between the components. As shown in Fig. 5, the plane and 3D infrared
spectra respectively exhibit the absorption peaks of SCPB, SCPB/Cu, SCPB/Ni, and
SCPB/CuNi.
All of SCPB-based samples showed strong infrared absorption between 7-22 min,
corresponding to a temperature range of 140‚Äì450 ¬∞C. The maximum infrared
absorption of SCPB and SCPB/CuNi occurred at 16 min, corresponding precisely with
the peak of the maximum weight loss rate displayed in DTG curves. It was observed
that the maximum infrared absorption of SCPB/CuNi at slightly lower temperatures,
suggesting that the addition of metal nitrate promoted the co-pyrolysis process with
biomass precursor.
The FTIR analysis identified the major functional groups, the stretching vibration bands
around 1650-1850 cm‚àí1 were attributed to N-O[47,48], while the bands between 10001450 cm‚àí1 corresponded to C-H and C-O bonds[46,49]. Additionally, several pyrolysis
products were identified based on their characteristic IR bands, including CO2 (24002240 cm-1), CO (2240-1980 cm-1), CH4 (3200-2850 cm-1), and H2O (3500-4000 cm-1),
which was a typical feature of the reported pyrolysis process of the lignocellulosic
biomass [49-51]. During the initial heating phase, the FTIR spectra of hydrated nitrates
exhibited broad peaks corresponding to O-H groups and lattice water at approximately
400 cm‚àí1 and 1630 cm‚àí1, respectively.
Upon loading Ni nitrate onto SCPB in Fig.5c-d, the 3D infrared spectra of SCPB/CuNi
exhibited a distinct gas release around 7 minutes, similar to SCPB/Ni, along with a band
at ~ 2200 cm‚àí1 attributed to N2O [52]. This behavior is absent in the single SCPB and
SCPB/Cu(Fig.5a-b), implying that the presence of nickel nitrate with the pyrolysis
parameter facilitated this gas evolution.

indicates that the quantity of COx, NxOx, O3 and HNO3 [47,48,53] generated increases
generally with the increase of heating rate from 10 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C, thus emphasizing that
the heating rate is a key factor of thermal treatment in controlling gas yields during the
process. The spectra of all samples presented similar peaks within same temperature
ranges. Figure 6d revealed the weight residual mass profiles reveal that biochar yields
remained remarkably consistent (¬± 1.5%) across heating rates of 10‚Äì30¬∞C/min.

Fig. 7. Kinetic plots of SCPB(a) and SCPB/CuNi(b) according to FWO methods.
By calculating the conversion rates, using the relationship between the heating rate
function and the inverse of temperature plotted followed by linear fitting. Both methods
provided good linear fitting results, and as Œ± increased, the fitting curves became
increasingly parallel, leading to more accurate and reliable estimates of the activation
energy (Ea) by the slope, as shown in Table 2.
Ea corresponds to reaction rates and kinetic stability[55]. It was significantly observed
that the Ea of SCPB/CuNi is significantly lower than that of SCPB at different
conversion rates, indicating that the pyrolysis reaction for SCPB/CuNi was easier to
proceed. Therefore, the introduction of metal nitrate with impregnation treatment, as a
pyrolysis catalyst, enhanced the catalytic activity and reduced the required energy for
the reaction of pure biomass SCPB.

3.4. Characterization of the solid products obtained by TG-FTIR.
Following the TG-FTIR investigations, the solid samples were recovered from the
crucibles and examined by XPS and Raman spectroscopy to account for the formation
of metal-loaded biochar during thermal analysis.
3.4.1. Surface chemical analysis by XPS
XPS was used to monitor the change in the surface chemical composition of the
biomass upon wet-impregnation and thermal analysis in TGA under nitrogen. The
survey spectra are shown in Figure 8a for the biomass and the resulting chars loaded
with mono and bimetallic systems. The main peaks are C1s (285 eV), O1s (532 eV),
N1s (400 eV), Cu2p (930-965 eV), and Ni2p (850-884 eV). Single metal systems show
the respective elements; the Cu2p and Ni2p spectra co-exist for the pyrolyzed biomass
loaded with copper and nickel nitrates. Thermal treatment leads to carbon-richer matter,
hence the lower O1/C1s intensity ratio noted for the chars compared to the initial
biomass. Drastic change occurs in the case of C1s ; the lignocellulosic matter has
typical C1s spectrum [56], exhibiting sp3 carbon atoms in C-C/C-H bonds at 285 eV
followed by C-O component at ~286.2 eV and acetal group O-C-O characteristic of
cellulose of which component is centered at 288.0 eV (Fig.8b). The thermal analysis
under nitrogen yields char which has a typical skewed high-resolution C1s spectrum
typical of carbon materials. The main peak is centered at 284.2 eV, with lower binding
energy consistent with sp¬≤ carbon atoms (Fig.8c). Figure 8d shows a peak-fitted N1s
spectrum from sugarcane bagasse, an amine-type nitrogen with a small portion from a
quaternized nitrogen (hydrogen bonds or protonation); SCB is known to contain less
than 1% nitrogen [57]. Upon thermal treatment, rearrangements of the functional
groups yield three major nitrogen-containing groups in biochar: pyridinic, pyrrolic, and
graphitic nitrogen atoms giving rise to a more complex N1s peak structure (Fig.8e)
which is fitted with three components centered at ~398.2, 399.9 and 401.4 eV,

component at 932.0 eV but with some extent of CuO, as judged from the component at

The N/C atomic ratio surprisingly remains the same although the thermal treatment
yields a carbon-rich material. This supports the formation of nitrogen-doped carbon by
thermal treatment. In contrast, O/C significantly decreases by nearly three-fold.
3.4.2. Raman spectra
The Raman spectroscopy revealed distinct peaks corresponding to the major
components, coupled with Raman microscopy demonstrated the image of the
morphological surface. Raman spectrum has been reported for qualitative analysis of
the cellulose and lignin[59]. Lignin is an aromatic polymer whose associated band does
not overlap with the carbohydrate bands, the peak position serves as a reliable marker
for lignin presence[60]. However, hemicellulose and cellulose share similar functional
groups and chemical bonds, resulting in the overlapping of the associated bands in the
Raman spectrum[59,61].
For the SCPB sample in Fig. 9a , the peaks at 1264 cm‚Åª¬π, 1605 cm‚Åª¬π and 1631 cm‚Åª¬π
19

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s2s0r ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5477-3354 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

corresponded to lignin, the peaks at 1092 cm‚Åª¬π and 1170 cm‚Åª¬π are associated with
cellulose rich in SCPB, which were visible in the Raman spectrum[62]. After the raw
SCPB was treated with wet impregnation to obtain SCPB/CuNi sample (Fig. 9b), the
peak positions of its lignocellulose structure showed almost no change just a slight
reduction of intensities. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of metal nitrites at 1326
cm‚Åª¬π and 980 cm‚Åª¬π associated with nitrate and nitrite[63,64], two bands at 336 cm‚Åª¬π and
587 cm‚Åª¬π were ascribed to Cu-O and Ni-O[65]. It could be due to nitrate ions attached
to the biomass support and metal ions bound to the functional groups of biomass, These
peaks appeared together with the cellulose and lignin peaks to suggest the metal nitrates
have been successfully introduced by the wetness impregnation method.
Nevertheless, during the pyrolysis process, another critical transformation that needed
attention was when both lignin and cellulose were decomposed and their characteristic
peaks completely disappeared in Fig. 9c, with new peaks appearing, and assigned to the
SCPBB biochar-based sample instead. The two distinct peaks observed at 1359 cm‚Åª¬π
and 1589 cm‚Åª¬π correspond to the D band and G band, respectively. The D band
represents defects of carbonaceous material, while the G band indicates the presence of
an ordered graphitic structure, confirming the fabrication of biochar material. Fig.9d
shows the positions of the metal oxides in SCPBB/CuNi shifted slightly after pyrolysis,
which potentially was attributed to the formation of CuNi [66].
Another important aspect was Raman imaging, the surface structure of the untreated
SCPB sample (as shown in Fig.8a) appears a dense fibrous appearance[67]. After the
wet impregnation treatment, the metal nanoparticle loaded on the SCPB sample still
retained its fiber structure without significant disruption (Fig.8b). As shown in Fig. 8c
and d, it is evident that the pyrolysis process leads to the decomposition of lignin and
cellulose, resulting in a significant transformation into a carbonaceous structure.
Notably, the biochar composition SCPBB/CuNi exhibits a unique porous structure with
an ordered arrangement due to the loading of metal nanoparticles, consistent with
previously reported SEM images[68]. This porosity was closely related to the gas
products detected in the TGA/FT-IR analysis mentioned earlier, indicating a significant

Through examining the characteristics of the generated gases and the change in the
solid products, previous experimental references, a preliminary understanding of the
reaction mechanisms was developed, attempting to elucidate the reaction pathways of
different components during the pyrolysis process. This process involves the pyrolysis
of metal-ammonia complexes (Cu(NH3)2¬∑3H2O and Ni(NH3)2¬∑6H2O) along with
biomass (CxHxOx) in a nitrogen atmosphere, heating from room temperature (RT) to
500¬∞C. The steps are summarized below in Fig.10 :

Step 1: Dehydration and Decomposition (50‚Äì170 ¬∞C)
The metal salts (Cu(NH3)2¬∑nH2O and Ni(NH3)2¬∑nH2O) and biomass SCPB(CxHxOx)
undergo dehydration as the temperature increases, losing water molecules.
This results in the formation of metal hydroxides in the presence of heat, such as
Cu2(OH)3NO3 and Ni2(OH)3NO3, along with water vapor [69,70].
Key Reactions:
M(NH‚ÇÉ)‚ÇÇ¬∑nH‚ÇÇO + SCPB(CxHxOx) ‚Üí M2(OH)3NO3 + SCPB(CxHxOx) + xH‚ÇÇO
(Where M = Cu or Ni)

Step 2: Reaction with Biomass (170‚Äì280 ¬∞C)
The metal hydroxides (like Cu2(OH)3NO3 and Ni2(OH)3NO3) react with biomass
components, particularly hemicellulose (SCPB), leading to the release of CO2, N2O,
NO, and the formation of CuxOx.
Key Reactions:
M2(OH)3NO3 + SCPB (Hemicellulose) ‚Üí CO2 + N2O + NO + MxOx

Step 3: Further Biomass Decomposition (280‚Äì450¬∞C)
At higher temperatures, metal oxides (e.g., Cu2O, Ni2O3) react with CO2 and partial
SCPB components (especially cellulose), producing CuO, NiO[71], CO, NO2, HNO3,
and CH4.
Key Reactions:
MxOx + SCPB (Cellulose) ‚Üí CO2 + CO + NO2 + HNO3 + CH4 + MO + M

Step 4: Reduction of Metal Oxides and Biochar Formation (450‚Äì500¬∞C, residence
time 1h at 500¬∞C)
At the highest temperatures, metal oxides (like CuO, NiO) are reduced to metallic
copper, nickel and alloy, while biomass lignin decomposes, forming biochar. CO2 is a
key gaseous product formed during whole pyrolysis process.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s2s0r ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5477-3354 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Key Reactions:
MO + SCPB (Lignin) ‚Üí M + SCPBB(biochar) + CO2
MO + SCPBB (biochar) ‚Üí M + SCPBB(porous biochar) + CO2
The metal oxides oxidize the biochar and contribute to the formation of the porous
structure [72,73].
Since CO2 is continuously produced over the whole pyrolysis temperature range, it is
likely that this syngas contributes to forming the biochar porous structure. Indeed,
pyrolysis under a CO2 atmosphere yields a higher specific surface area than that
conducted under nitrogen [74].
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the pyrolysis of SCPB and SCPB/CuNi through wet
impregnation leads to enhanced thermal conversion and the formation of biochar with
distinct chemical and structural properties. The incorporation of metal nanoparticles,
through wet impregnation and pyrolysis sequential steps, significantly reduces the
activation energy (determined using FWO and DAEM methods), facilitating the
thermochemical conversion process. FT-IR spectroscopy provided detailed insights into
the gas phase products during the decomposition of hydrated copper and nickel nitrates
on biomass. The analysis revealed stages of dehydration, nitrate decomposition, and
reduction reactions, with corresponding gas phase products including water vapor,
nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. This method
effectively monitored the transformations and provided a comprehensive understanding
of the gas evolution in the thermal processing of nitrate salts on biomass. XPS and
Raman analyses reveal that both TG-biochar (biochar obtained by TGA) and tubular
furnace biochar share similar chemical compositions, including nitrogen-functionalized
structures and graphitic carbon formation. This given strong supporting evidence that
the actual study conducted by TG-FTIR accounts very well for the thermochemical
conversion of SCPB biomass impregnated with copper and nickel nitrates, under
similar pyrolysis conditions. Clearly, the TG-FTIR setup is a reliable technique to
simulate the pyrolysis process in a tubular furnace which leads to reactive and

functional porous biochar loaded with metallic nanometals. Moreover, nickel could be
regarded as an ideal activator (like the traditional ZnCl2 and FeCl3) for the pyrolysis of
wet-impregnated biomass. It has multiple advantages: it activates pyrolysis and
provides a biochar porous structure, it yields immobilized catalytic nanoparticles, and
imparts magnetic properties to the biochar support.
