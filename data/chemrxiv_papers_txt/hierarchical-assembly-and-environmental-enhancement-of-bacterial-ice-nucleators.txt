Abstract:

22

Bacterial ice nucleating proteins (INPs) are exceptionally effective in promoting the kinetically

23

hindered transition of water to ice. Their efficiency relies on the assembly of INPs into large

24

functional aggregates, with the size of ice nucleation sites determining activity. Experimental

25

freezing spectra have revealed two distinct, defined aggregate sizes, typically classified as class

26

A and C ice nucleators (INs). Despite the importance of INPs and years of extensive research,

27

the precise number of INPs forming the two aggregate classes and their assembly mechanism

28

have remained enigmatic. Here, we report that bacterial ice nucleation activity emerges from

29

more than two prevailing aggregate species and identify the specific number of INPs

30

responsible for distinct crystallization temperatures. We find that INP dimers constitute class

31

C INs, tetramers class B INs, and hexamers and larger multimers are responsible for the most

32

efficient class A activity. We propose a hierarchical assembly mechanism based on tyrosine

33

interactions for dimers, and electrostatic interactions between INP dimers to produce larger

34

aggregates. This assembly is membrane-assisted: increasing the bacterial outer membrane

35

fluidity decreases the population of the larger aggregates, while preserving the dimers.

36

Inversely, DPBS buffer increases the population of multimeric class A and B aggregates 200-

37

fold and endows the bacteria with enhanced stability towards repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Our

38

analysis suggests that the enhancement results from the better alignment of dimers in the

39

negatively charged outer membrane, due to screening of their electrostatic repulsion. This

40

constitutes the first demonstration of enhancement of the most potent bacterial INs.

41
42

Significance:

43

Fifty years ago, bacteria were identified as remarkable ice nucleators that enable water freezing

44

close to 0 °C. Their record-holding activity is key for frost damage to crops and snow making.

45

While it is known that bacterial freezing relies on the assembly of INPs, details of the

46

underlying assembly mechanism and structures remained elusive. Here, we elucidate the size

47

of the INP multimers responsible for superior ice nucleation and their formation process. We

48

unravel a hierarchical assembly mechanism that explains the distinct ice nucleation

49

temperatures of bacteria and their sensitivity to environmental factors. We demonstrate

50

enhancement of the ice nucleation potency of the bacteria by controlling the pH and ionic

51

content, expanding their potential use in freezing applications.

Introduction:

56

Bacterial ice nucleators (INs) are highly efficient in initiating ice crystallization at high sub-

57

zero temperatures. Their remarkable control of the crystallization process is based on

58

specialized ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) that are anchored to the outer membrane of the

59

bacterial cell wall and are proposed to form large functional aggregates (1–3). The most

60

extensively studied bacterial INs are Pseudomonas syringae, which enable ice formation at

61

temperatures up to -2°C (4, 5). As plant pathogens, they use their freezing capabilities to

62

provoke frost injuries to plant tissues, allowing them to access the plant’s nutrients (6).

63

Together with their widespread distribution (7–9), this makes P. syringae a significant

64

contributor to frost damage in the biosphere, causing agricultural losses through crop

65

devastation (10). Bacterial INs have further been detected in rain, hail, and snow, pointing to a

66

role in atmospheric freezing processes, influencing the hydrological cycle and the overall

67

balance of Earth's climate (11–14). Due to their superior freezing efficiency, bacterial INs are

68

widely used for artificial snowmaking and are raising attention for potential use in

69

cryopreservation, anti-icing surfaces, and novel freezing technologies (15–18). Despite their

70

importance and the extensive research over the past years (1, 3, 19–26), several questions

71

remain unanswered regarding their mode of action and the possibility of enhancing their ice

72

nucleation efficiency and resistance to freeze-thawing cycles. These are the questions we

73

address in the present study.

74

The principal modus operandi of INPs is to provide a surface that strongly binds to ice, thus

75

decreasing the free energy barrier for ice nucleation (2). The strong binding is supported by the

76

ordering of water at the ice-binding surfaces of the INP (19, 20, 27, 28). The general structure

77

of bacterial INPs is subdivided into three domains (27), with the central repeating domain

78

(CRD) comprising the majority of the structure. The CRD contains the active site and is formed

79

by a variable number of tandem repeats of a highly conserved 16-residue sequence (19). The

80

N-terminal domain is involved in anchoring the protein to the membrane, and the C-terminal

81

domain is proposed to have a capping function to stabilize the protein structure (21). However,

82

the structural characterization of INPs, remains challenging due to their large size (~ 130 kDa)

83

and localization in the outer membrane (OM). Several theoretical studies predicted β-solenoid

84

folds for the CRD of INPs, where the active site consists of long arrays of TxT motifs located

85

on one side and SLT motifs located on the opposite side of the flat solenoid structure (21–24,

86

29).

87

While an INP structure provides water-organizing motifs of high repetitiveness, the ice-binding

88

area of monomeric INPs is insufficient to achieve high ice nucleation efficiencies. To

89

accomplish freezing close to 0°C, bacterial INs critically depend on their ability to form large

90

INP multimers (2, 25, 30, 31). A distribution of sizes of ice nucleation sites is further required

91

to explain the typically broad freezing range from -2 to -12°C. Freezing assays revealed that

92

bacterial INs are active in particular temperature regions, which led to the categorization of INs

93

into three distinct classes (32). Class A comprises the most efficient INs active at temperatures

94

above -4.4°C, class B IN are active between -4.4 and -7.6°C, and class C IN active below -

95

7.6°C (32). Although there is agreement that Class C INs correspond to small INPs aggregates,

96

and class A INs to larger INP assemblies, little is known about the definite size and numbers

97

of INPs involved in these multimers and their assembly mechanism (3, 24, 25). Simulations

98

and nucleation theory have addressed the size and assembly pattern of aggregated INPs (2).

99

However, quantitative predictions are highly sensitive to the actual dimension of the protein

100

binding surface, distance between monomers, alignment between the INPs, as well as strength

101

of protein-ice interactions (2). Furthermore, an intact bacterial membrane has been shown to

102

be required for functional aggregation of INPs (33–35). Removal of the membrane abolishes

103

class A IN activity, and the addition of membrane lipids fails to restore it (33). Membrane

104

fluidity disrupting agents have been shown to decrease class A activity (4, 34), indicating that

105

the membrane is not only a matrix for INP assembly but also has a decisive role in functional

106

aggregation.

107

Here we combine ice nucleation and membrane fluidity experiments, numerical modelling, AI-

108

based protein structure prediction, and nucleation theory to elucidate the number of proteins in

109

the IN of P. syringae, propose a hierarchical mechanism for their assembly, confirm the key

110

role of the outer membranes in the stability of larger aggregates, and demonstrate that the right

111

combination of pH and ions in the ice nucleating solution preserves the large INs against

112

disassembly in freeze-thawing cycles and -most surprisingly- promotes their assembly. Using

113

these insights, we make Snomax® as potent an ice nucleation agent as the as the most potent

114

strains of live P. syringae.

Freeze-thaw cycles result in the disassembly of large INP aggregates into smaller ones.

120

Fig. 1A shows the cumulative freezing spectra of bacteria from the strain Pseudomonas

121

syringae Cit7, subjected to consecutive freeze-thaw cycles. The initial freezing spectrum of a

122

ten-fold dilution series of alive P. syringae in water with an initial concentration of 0.1 mg/mL

123

displays a wide range of freezing temperatures with maximum ice nucleation activity up to -

124

2°C. The freezing spectrum shows a strong increase in the cumulative IN concentration Nm(T)

125

per unit mass of bacteria at -2.4°C and a second increase at -7.5°C, with plateaus between -5°C

126

and -7°C and below -9°C. The two steep increases in the freezing spectrum indicate that the

127

activity of P. syringae originates from IN species with different nucleation efficiencies. In

128

contrast, plateaus indicate few active INs at these temperature ranges. Based on their nucleation

129

temperatures, we assign the IN species to class A (-2.4°C) and C (-7.5°C) INs. We did not

130

observe class B INs in the cumulative freezing spectra, in agreement with previous studies (3,

131

30, 33, 36–38).

139

The ice nucleation activity shows a consistent trend when the bacteria undergo repetitive

140

freeze-thaw cycles. Class A INs exhibit progressive degradation, leading to a lower cumulative

141

concentration, as well as a shift to lower temperatures. In contrast, Nm(T) of class C INs

142

increases throughout the cycles. Since freeze-thaw cycles do not cause chemical changes in the

143

INP aggregate structures, this alteration in the ice nucleation activity must originate from

144

physical effects. These observations align with previous findings which showed that bacterial

145

INs with high freezing efficiencies are unstable towards changing environmental conditions,

146

whereas IN active at lower temperatures remain stable (30, 32, 36).

147

To systematically investigate the changes in the freezing spectra for every cycle, we analyzed

148

the underlying distribution of heterogeneous ice nucleation temperatures. The differential

149

freezing spectra are derived from the cumulative spectra by using the Heterogeneous

150

Underlying-Based (HUB) method (39). This analysis implements a stochastic optimization

151

procedure that fits the experimentally obtained cumulative spectra with a linear combination

152

of Gaussian subpopulations. The resulting computed differential spectra that reproduce the

153

distribution of ice nucleation temperatures allow for a characterization of the underlying IN

154

classes.

155

We find that fitting the spectra with a combination of two subpopulations based on the

156

assignment of two distinct IN classes does not match the initial freezing spectrum of P.

157

syringae and exhibits a discrepancy between -3.8 and -7.3°C and a mean squared error (MSE)

158

of 0.53% (for details see Fig. S1). A more accurate solution is achieved by considering three

159

subpopulations, which lowers MSE to 0.1%, a factor of five improvement for 1.5 times the

160

number of fit parameters. The resulting differential spectrum reveals that 49% of the IN

161

nucleate ice at -8.6±1.5°C, 39% are active at -4.3±0.5°C, and 12% are active at -3.1±0.2°C.

162

We assign the subpopulation active at -8.6°C to class C. The other subpopulations are assigned

163

to class A INs, since both modes fall into the class A regime (32). This implies that the ice

164

nucleation activity of P. syringae relies on more than two IN populations and that class A

165

consists of more than one aggregate species.

166

The HUB analysis also reveals that class C INs increase from 49% to 99.6% within ten freeze-

167

thaw cycles, while the class A subpopulations decline over hundred-fold, from 39% to 0.3%

168

and from 12% to less than 0.1%. Throughout these changes in the IN populations, the total

169

cumulative concentration of INs per mass unit remains constant, highlighting that no INs are

170

lost. These results prove that class A INs are not destroyed, but rather transformed into class C

171

INs through repetitive freezing. Moreover, we observe an additional temperature shift for both

172

class A subpopulations to lower temperatures. The IN subpopulation active at -4.3°C changes

173

to -5.3°C, shifting from class A into class B regime. The HUB analysis shows that class C INs

174

are the most stable IN population, since their fraction does not decrease over time and the total

175

IN number remains constant. Although class B INs are not in the original cumulative freezing

176

spectra, the distribution analysis confirms its presence after several freeze-thaw cycles. We

177

conclude that the higher-ordered class A INP aggregates are destabilized during repetitive

178

freezing and disassemble into smaller INP aggregates with lower ice nucleation temperatures.

179
180

Class C are INP dimers, B are tetramers, and A are hexamers and larger aggregates.

181

To determine the number NINP of INPs required for the formation of aggregates promoting ice

182

formation at the observed freezing temperatures, we utilize the HINT algorithm (2). HINT

183

predicts heterogeneous ice nucleation temperatures of surfaces of finite size using classical

184

nucleation theory parameterized with experimental data for water (2). We assume for the HINT

185

calculation that the ice-binding surface is flat and the distance between monomers remains

186

constant. The inset of Fig. 2A shows the predicted AlphaFold structure of the INP of P.

187

syringae (40). The protein fold is predicted with high confidence level (Fig. S2) and reveals a

188

length of ~30 nm and a maximum width d of the CRD about 3.4 nm. Previous simulations

189

showed that increasing the length of the water-organizing β-helix of INPs does not have a

190

significant effect on the corresponding ice nucleation temperature, whereas expanding the

191

width of the system by parallel alignment of INPs results in enhanced efficiency (2). Figure 2A

192

shows the predicted ice nucleation temperatures of the side-by-side INP aggregates, together

193

with the ranges for class A, B and C.

aggregates. The number in squared brackets describes the NINP of the aggregate.

Fig. 2B presents an overlay of the distribution of populations of IN in P. syringae on the 1st

208

and 10th freeze-thaw-cycle, together with the predicted ice nucleation temperatures Thet as a

209

function of the number of side-by-side INPs at the ice-binding site. By comparing the results

210

of HINT with the distribution analysis of the freeze-thaw experiments, we obtain a correlation

211

between INP aggregate sizes and the corresponding temperature modes of the subpopulations.

212

We find no INP monomers or trimers in the bacteria: class C activity corresponds to the INP

213

dimer, confirming the assignment of previous studies (22, 24). The efficiency of such dimers

214

relies on the equal ice nucleation ability of the two-sides of the INP (23). Our analysis reveals

215

that a minimum of six INPs are required to reach the temperature range of class A INs.

216

We conclude that in the initial freezing spectrum of P. syringae the class C INs originate from

217

INP dimers, the class A INs with lower efficiency (-4.3°C) from hexamers, and the most

218

efficient class A INs (-3.1°C) from multimers containing at least 12 INPs. No significant

219

changes occur to the class C dimers upon freeze-thaw cycling, whereas the other

220

subpopulations change dramatically along these cycles. Figure 2B supports that the class A IN

221

subpopulation corresponding to hexamers disassembles to produce tetramers, which we assign

222

as class B INs, resulting in the disappearance of the larger multimeric aggregates of Class A

223

INs from the freezing spectrum.

224

To generalize our findings, we analyzed the widely used sample Snomax® (Fig. 2b, Fig. S3)

225

(41, 42), which consists of inactivated bacteria from P. syringae. Similar to alive bacteria, the

226

inactivated bacteria show class A and class C INs (see SI, Fig. S3), which we assign to INP

227

multimers and the INP dimer, respectively. The distribution analysis of Snomax further

228

confirms the existence of class B INs originating from INP tetramers.

229
230

Size of aggregates is consistent with a dimer-based assembly mechanism driven by

231

electrostatics.

232

The assignment of even-number INP aggregates (dimers, tetramers, octamers, etc.) defies

233

previous expectations of a continuum of sizes. It elicits the question of what determines the

234

proportion of INP aggregates and their assembly mechanism.

235

We interpret that the dimerization of INPs is due to the stacking of the highly conserved

236

tyrosine ladders (22), which create a surface where the ice-making motifs on the two sides of

237

the β-helix align to expand the width of the combined nucleation site, and that the assembly of

238

the larger aggregates is driven by electrostatic interactions. Fig. 3A shows the electrostatic

239

surface model of the INP, which we obtained using AlphaFold. The INP model shows a clear

240

pattern of charged residues. A large number of negative residues are located close to the N-

241

terminal domain of the solenoid, whereas several positively charged residues are found close

242

to the C-terminal domain. In addition, the tail of the C-terminal domain also contains charged

243

residues. Our calculations with Alphafold version 2.3.2 (43) predict that the P. syringae INP

244

dimer and higher multimeric aggregates form twisted amyloid structures that bury the ice-

245

nucleating protein surfaces from water (Fig. S4). Those structures are inconsistent with the

246

high ice nucleation temperatures of the bacteria.

247

We propose that INP dimers assemble into tetramers through electrostatic interactions by the

248

outward-facing positively and negatively charged residues found on opposing ends of the β-

249

solenoids and opposite to the tyrosine ladder (Fig. 3B). The INP tetramer formation is assisted

250

by the disordered charged tail of the C-terminal domain, which acts as a cap and provides

251

structural stability. The essential function of the C-terminal domain in the proposed dimer and

252

tetramer assembly mechanism is in line with previous reports that showed that deletion of the

253

C-terminal domain eliminated all activity (21, 44, 45). Capping structures are further known to

254

be essential for the stability of β-solenoids, and in their absence the solenoids tend to unravel

255

or form amyloid fibrils (46).

whereas negatively charged residues (red) are found closer to the N-terminus. (B) INP
assembly mechanism into dimers, tetramers, hexamers, octamers, and higher-order multimers.
Dimer formation is mediated through the stacking of the solvent-exposed tyrosine ladders
(green areas) between adjacent monomers and is assisted by the C-terminal tail (yellow) which
likely acts as a cap. The tetramer, hexamer, and octamer formation are mediated through
electrostatic interactions by outward-facing positively and negatively charged residues found
on opposing ends of the β-solenoids opposite to the tyrosine ladder. Octamers can be formed
by electrostatic interactions between a tetramer and two dimers or between two tetramer units.

267
268

The bacterial outer membrane is key for the assembly of dimers into larger aggregates.

269

Having established the size of the INP aggregates in the bacteria, we focus on the role of the

270

OM in the functional INP assembly. It has previously been shown that aggregation of class C

271

bacterial INPs can occur in solution (24), but the OM is needed to produce the most active INs.

272

To probe the role of the OM on the stability of bacterial INs, we measure ice nucleation by

273

Snomax as a function of treatment temperature, in the presence of membrane fluidizing agents,

274

at low pH, and in the absence and presence of ions. By focusing on inactivated bacteria, we

275

can exclude physiological factors such as protein synthesis, or homeoviscous adaptation,

276

enabling us to single out the physical impact of environmental changes and cosolutes on OM

277

fluidity and their impact on ice nucleation.

278

Fig. 4A shows the cumulative freezing spectra of Snomax as a function of changing

279

environmental conditions. We find that when Snomax is subjected to warm temperatures prior

280

to ice nucleation activity measurements, class A INs disintegrate, as evidenced in the freezing

281

spectra and the corresponding distribution functions (Fig. 4B). This effect becomes more

282

pronounced at higher temperatures, with class A and B INs completely disappearing when

283

Snomax is exposed to temperatures above 35°C (Fig. S5). Under such conditions, the freezing

284

activity is primarily due to the robust dimers of class C INs. Importantly, previous studies

285

showed that temperatures up to 35°C do not cause secondary structure changes in INPs (26,

286

45). This is in line with our observation that no loss of cumulative IN concentrations occurs up

287

to 30°C and that Nm only decreases beyond 35°C. We conclude that elevated temperatures

288

impact the stability of the larger, more efficient INP aggregates, while leaving the INP dimers

289

intact.

Membrane fluidity measurements show that the inherently rigid OM (47) become more fluid

300

upon heating (Fig. 4C, Fig. S6). This increase is associated with enhanced lateral mobility of

301

membrane components, enabling INPs to diffuse within the more fluid membrane, thus

302

facilitating the disassembly of larger INP aggregates. The finding that enhanced membrane

303

fluidity disintegrates class A INs is supported by our freezing spectra in the absence of ions, at

304

low pH, and in the presence of 2-Phenylethanol (PhEtOH). All these conditions are known to

305

increase membrane fluidity (48), and induce similar changes to the distribution of bacterial IN

306

classes (Fig. 4A, B). In all spectra, only class C INs prevail, and the additional shift observed

307

e.g. for PhEtOH can be explained by the colligative melting point depression. The minimal

308

temperature dependence of class C INs starkly contrasts with the environmental sensitivity of

309

the larger INP aggregates into which they assemble.

310
311

DPBS buffer stabilizes and promotes the formation of large class A aggregates.

312

Having identified which parameters decrease class A IN activity, we now address whether it is

313

possible to stabilize and promote the formation of the large class A IN. Figure 5 shows freezing

314

spectra of Snomax in water, DPBS, and HEPES buffer at pH 7. Strikingly, we find a

315

tremendous enhancement of class A IN activity when measurements were performed in DPBS

316

buffer, which contains sodium and potassium chloride in addition to the Na2HPO4/KH2PO4

317

buffer system. The combined fraction of class A and B increases 200-fold, from 0.1% in water

318

to 19.5% in DPBS. We further observed only a minimal shift towards lower temperatures,

319

despite an expected melting point depression caused by the buffer compounds. This

320

demonstrates that DPBS buffer efficiently promotes larger INP assemblies. Moreover, DBPS

321

endows the bacteria with enhanced stability towards repeated freeze-thaw cycles (Fig. S7).

328

Maintaining the pH level within a physiological range is critical for the stability of INP

329

multimers (30), as moving to acidic pH levels and approaching the isoelectric point of the INPs

330

prevents the formation of multimers, highlighting that electrostatic interactions between dimer

331

units play a pivotal role in functional INP aggregation. Yet, measurements in HEPES buffer

332

show that the optimal pH range alone is insufficient to enhance INP activity (Fig. 5).

333

Measurements in the presence of HEPES at the same pH as DPBS did not result in enhancement

334

(Fig. 5). DPBS contains cations absent in HEPES, suggesting that there are specific ion effects

335

influencing the stabilization of large INP aggregates. By systematically measuring Snomax in

336

the presence of the different buffer components (Fig. S7B), we reveal that the presence of

337

sodium and potassium chloride with the Na2KHPO4/KH2PO4 buffer system in DPBS is

338

required to effectively stabilize INP multimers in Snomax. Experiments in NaCl confirm that

339

salt alone has no effect on the class A INs in aqueous solutions, while it shows a clear increase

340

in INP stabilization in the buffer (Fig. S7).

341

Fig S8 demonstrates that enhancement effects can be induced in buffers that were originally

342

not showing enhancement through the addition of salts (e.g. adding NaCl to HEPES buffer).

343

We interpret that the resultant concentration of monovalent cations screens the highly

344

negatively charged lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the OM, strengthening the interactions

345

between the negatively charged proteins (48). We propose that the ion/buffer system limits

346

electrostatic interactions between the predominantly negative LPS and INPs, stabilizes

347

membrane integrity, and thus promotes interactions between INP dimers for aggregation.

348
349

Conclusions:

350

Our results and analyses provide a unifying, quantitative picture of the assembly mechanism

351

of bacterial ice nucleation and the properties of distinct IN classes. By combining results from

352

droplet freezing experiments with stochastic optimization procedures, we identify more than

353

the two commonly discussed class A and class C INs observed in the cumulative freezing

354

spectra of ice-active bacteria. Using the improved structural prediction by AlphaFold of the

355

width and length of the ice-binding site of the bacterial protein combined with nucleation

356

theory calculations of the heterogeneous ice nucleation temperature for finite-size surfaces, we

357

determine the distinct sizes of the different INP aggregates in the bacteria. We confirm that

358

INP dimers are the fundamental unit for aggregation for class C activity and unveil that Class

359

A INs consist of different multimers comprising at least INP hexamers. Our findings highlight

360

that class A IN activity is achieved by INP aggregates with sizes as small as ~ 720 kDa, about

361

25 times smaller than previously proposed sizes of ~19,000 kDa (25). We propose that the

362

formation of the multimers is based on electrostatic interactions between INP dimers, which

363

show a distinctive complementary pattern of outward-facing regions with high charge

364

densities. Our work further resolves the enigma of the originally proposed class B, whose

365

existence we now confirm and ascribe to INP tetramers.

Fig. 6. Proposed mechanism of functional INP aggregation in the bacterial OM. Environmental
factors such as pH, cosolutes, or temperature can alter membrane fluidity and interprotein
interactions, which results in the disassembly of the large functional INP aggregates necessary
for ice nucleation activity at high sub-zero temperatures.

371
372

Our systematic alteration of experimental conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, cosolutes) provides

373

conclusive evidence supporting a mechanism where the highest ice nucleation activity in

374

bacteria originates from the formation of functional INP aggregates within the OM as

375

schematically shown in Figure 6. This is further underlined by a recent study highlighting that

376

class C INs are insensitive to extreme pH from 2 to 11 and heating when the membrane is

377

absent (44). In contrast, minimal pH and temperature changes are sufficient to drastically

378

decrease class A IN activity in the intact membrane (30).

379

Remarkably, we discover that bacterial ice nucleation can be enhanced by stabilizing INP and

380

membrane-protein interactions through carefully balancing external factors (ions, pH,

381

temperature). We demonstrate that the conditions that enhance the population of class A

382

aggregates also protect the bacteria against loss of ice nucleation potency upon freeze-thaw

383

cycles. We conjecture that the enhancement arises from the correct alignment of INPs within

384

the aggregates upon screening of their negative charge. The sensitivity to environmental

385

conditions is consistent with the predictions that even slight (Angstrom) variations of distances

386

between INPs (e.g. due to environmental changes) destabilize the budding ice embryos on the

387

protein surface, dramatically decreasing the ice nucleation temperature (2). Bacteria must exert

388

exquisite control of the distance and alignment of the INP on its OM to freeze ice at

389

temperatures as high as -2oC (2). Our findings in this work demonstrate that this control can be

390

effectively exerted through environmental variables, broadening the range of uses of bacterial

391

INPs for freezing applications and opening the question of whether these controls are used by

392

the bacteria under physiological conditions.

Sample Preparation:

410

P. syringae CiT7 were grown on King B agar for 3 days at 21°C before assaying. The samples

411

were prepared in pure water with a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Snomax samples were

412

prepared in pure water, 0.1 M buffer, and various salt solutions with a concentration of 0.1

413

mg/mL. Commercial DPBS buffer (Sigma D1408, pH 7) was used as received. MOPS (pH 7)

414

and HEPES buffer (pH 7) were prepared without adding salts and the pH values were adjusted

415

by adding NaOH. Components of DPBS were measured by preparing a 9.57 mM

416

Na2HPO4/KH2PO4 solution, a 0.14 M NaCl solution, a 2.68 mM KCl solutions, and combined

417

salt solutions of the same molarities. For dialysis measurements, Snomax samples were

418

dialyzed at 4°C against pure water for 24 hours, and for cosolutes measurements in the presence

419

of 50 mM 2-Phenylethanol.

420

TINA measurements:

421

Ice nucleation experiments were performed using the high-throughput Twin-plate Ice

422

Nucleation Assay (TINA), which has been described in detail elsewhere (49). In a typical

423

experiment, the investigated IN sample was serially diluted 10-fold by a liquid handling station

424

(epMotion ep5073, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). 96 droplets (droplet volume: 3 μL) per

425

dilution were placed on two 384-well plates and tested with a continuous cooling-rate of 1

426

°C/min from 0 °C to -30 °C. The droplet freezing events were detected by two infrared cameras

427

(Seek Thermal Compact XR, Seek Thermal Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The uncertainty in

428

the temperature of the setup was ±0.2 °C. The cumulative number of INs was inferred from the

429

obtained fraction of frozen droplets using the Vali formula (50). Experiments were performed

430

at least three times on independent samples. Background freezing of pure water in our system

431

occurred at ~-21°C.

432

Temperature-dependent Measurements:

433

For freeze-thaw experiments of P. syringae, samples of a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in pure

434

water were serially diluted 2-fold to create dilutions ranging from 0.1 mg/mL to 0.5 µg/mL.

435

After being cooled down to -30°C, the samples were allowed to thaw at room temperature

436

before the next measurement. 15 consecutive freeze-thaw cycles were performed. The same

437

procedure was carried out for freeze-thaw experiments of Snomax in pure water (0.1 mg/mL,

438

10-fold dilution series, 12 cycles) and in 0.1 M DBPS buffer solution (0.1 mg/mL, 10-fold

439

dilution series, 12 cycles). Snomax samples were prepared in pure water with a concentration

440

of 0.1 mg/mL and heated to temperatures ranging from 20°C to 45°C for one hour prior to

441

measurement (0.1 mg/mL, 10-fold dilution series).

Identification of the Ice Nucleating Subpopulations through HUB Analysis:

444

The Heterogeneous Underlying-Based (HUB) method (39) was utilized for the identification

445

and quantification of the subpopulations that constitute the experimental cumulative freezing

446

spectra. This method uses a stochastic optimization technique to extract the underlying

447

distribution of heterogeneous ice nucleation temperatures Pu(T) that describes the characteristic

448

freezing temperatures of all INs in a sample. For this, the HUB-backward code available as a

449

Python code (https://github.com/Molinero-Group/underlying-distribution) was used to

450

compute the differential freezing spectra nm(T), representing Pu(T), from the cumulative

451

freezing spectra Nm(T) obtained from TINA experiments. Pu(T) is assumed to be a linear

452

combination of normalized Gaussian distribution functions Pi(T) that represents a distinct

453

number of subpopulations p of the weights ci that give ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 = 1. Each subpopulation Pi(T)

𝑝𝑝

454

is further characterized by its characteristic freezing temperature mode Tmode,i and the spread

455

of the temperature distribution si. The experimentally obtained Nm(T) is interpolated through a

456

spline and smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay filter of first polynomial order with a default value

457

of 3 for the length of the filter window. For Snomax, data are interpolated with a number of

458

100 equally spaced points and for bacterial samples from P. syringae with 500 points. The

459

mean squared error MSE defines the accuracy of the determined set of parameters for the

460

distribution function. For further analysis, optimized results with the lowest MSE were

461

selected.

462
463

Prediction of the Protein Structures with AlphaFold:

464

AlphaFold (V2.0.1) and (V.2.3.2) were used for structure predictions with the required

465

databases downloaded from the AF2 GitHub repository (43). The best ranked AlphaFold

466

monomer model of the INP using V.2.01 contained a kink close to residue D555 (40). The

467

newer AlphaFold version predicts a straighter INP β-helix. However other ranked models

468

constructed by V.2.3.2 also exhibited kinks/twists (Fig. S4). The AlphaFold predictions of the

469

INP dimers and multimeric aggregates exhibited twisted and kinked structures (Fig. S4) that

470

do not match the observed high ice nucleation temperatures. All models were constructed using

471

the same settings except the maximal template date was set as 09-15-2021 for the old model,

472

and 08-30-2023 for the newer models.

473
474

Prediction of the Ice Nucleation Temperatures of INP Aggregates:

475

The HINT algorithm accurately implements numerical classical nucleation theory to predict

476

the heterogeneous nucleation temperature of ice on finite-sized surfaces using thermodynamic

477

and dynamic data from water, as well as the binding free energy of the IN to ice ∆γbind (2, 51).

478

With that data, HINT computes the free energy barriers for ice nucleation and the prefactor for

479

the nucleation rate, using as reference that the experimental ice nucleation rate Jexp = 105

480

cm−3s−1 for microliter droplets cooled at 1 °C/min (52–54). We start by assuming that P.

481

syringae’s INP binds ice as strong as ice itself, i.e., ∆γbind = −2 γice-liquid, as demonstrated in (2).

482

Additionally, we consider a line tension of 𝜏𝜏 = 10 pN. The IN surface area is assumed to be

483
484

rectangular, with a width W = 3.4 nm and length L = 30 nm, consistent with the structure
predicted by AlphaFold (40). We assume that functional aggregates with n INP have width Wn

485

= n x 3.4 nm and length L = 30 nm, consistent with the model of assembly we propose in this

486

study.

487

Using the HINT code, which models ice nuclei as cylinders with two half-spherical caps at

488

each end, we calculate the free energy cost ∆G for various configurations by adjusting the

489

number of water molecules N* and the contact angle θ of the ice nucleus on the nucleating

490

surface (2). This allows us to identify the optimal size for ice growth with the lowest energy

491

cost, determined by the smallest ∆G for a specific number of water molecules. From this set,

492

we identify the ice nucleation barrier ΔG*(T), which corresponds to the highest value of

493

∆G*(T) within a temperature range from Tm to Thom, with a resolution of 0.1K. We continue

494

this computation until the calculated ΔG*(T) matches the value derived from the homogeneous

495

nucleation rate (2).

497

Membrane Fluidity Measurement:

498

For the measurement of membrane fluidity, a 10 mM stock solution of the membrane dye

499

Laurdan in DMF was prepared. Aqueous samples of Snomax were prepared at a concentration

500

of 1mg/mL. Laurdan solution was added to a final concentration of 40 µM, and the samples

501

were stirred for 1 hour at 500rpm. The stained samples were washed twice to remove excess

502

dye, by centrifugation at 15,000x g for and after the final washing step, the samples were

503

subjected to the desired temperature using a thermomixer. Snomax samples containing 2-

504

phenylethanol (50 mM) were equilibrated at 21°C. For temperature-dependent measurements,

505

Snomax samples were treated at different temperatures for 15 minutes. The temperature series

506

started at 10°C and proceeded in 5°C intervals up to 50°C. Fluorescence measurements (TIDAS

507

FL3095 SL, J&M, Essingen, Germany) were performed using an excitation wavelength of 350

508

nm, and fluorescence emission was recorded from 370 to 800 nm. The integration time was set

509

to 10,000 ms and emission spectra were obtained by averaging three measurements. To

510

determine the membrane fluidity, the spectra were normalized and the generalized polarisation

511

(GP) was calculated using

512

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 =

𝐼𝐼440nm − 𝐼𝐼490nm
𝐼𝐼440nm + 𝐼𝐼490nm

513

where I440nm is the fluorescence emission intensity at 440nm and I490nm is the intensity at 490nm.

514

High GP values correspond to low membrane fluidity and low values to high membrane

515

fluidity.
