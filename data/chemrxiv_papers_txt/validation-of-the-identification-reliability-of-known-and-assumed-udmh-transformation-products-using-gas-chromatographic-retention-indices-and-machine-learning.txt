Abstract

9

Thirty two commercially available standards were used to determine chromatographic retention indices

10

(RIs) for three different stationary phases. The selected compounds were nitrogen-containing heterocycles

11

and amides, which are unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) transformation products or its assumed

12

transformation products. UDMH is a highly toxic compound widely used in the space industry, that forms

13

a number of different compounds in the environment. Well-known transformation products may exceed

14

UDMH itself in their toxicity, but most of the products are poorly investigated, while posing a huge

15

environmental threat. Experimental RIs for the stationary phases, RIs from the NIST database, and

16

predicted RIs are presented in this paper. It is shown that there are virtually no RIs for UDMH

17

transformation products in the NIST database. In addition, even among those compounds for which RIs

18

were known, inconsistencies were identified. Adding RIs to the database and eliminating erroneous data

19

would allow for more reliable identification when standards are not available. The discrepancies identified

20

between experimental RI values and predicted values will allow for adjustments to the machine learning

21

models that are used for prediction. Previously proposed compounds as possible transformation products

22

without the use of standards and NMR method were confirmed.

1. Introduction

27

Due to the rising amount of new chemicals released to the environment non-targeted analysis using

28

mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to liquid/gas chromatography (LC/GC) have risen as a new approach in

29

analytical chemistry to detect, identify and eventually quantify chemicals in environmental samples [1,2].

30

Especially non-targeted analysis is prevalent when working with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine

31

(UDMH), which is a toxic component of rocket fuel. The particular complexity of UDMH as a research

32

object lies in its high reactivity, which leads to the formation of a large number of transformation products

33

[3,4]. Establishing the structure of new UDMH transformation products is a challenging task as standard

34

samples are in most cases unavailable. Also, various environmental factors, such as humidity, pH, matrix,

35

etc., influence the UDMH transformation, which leads to the fact that at the moment there is no precise

36

understanding of what substances will be formed under certain conditions [5,6]. The expansive distribution

37

of false transformation products should be mentioned, as often the identification of new compounds

38

belonging to transformation products is superficially performed only by the mass spectra obtained without

39

the use of additional methods [5,7]. In our work, we also observed that some compounds might not be

40

available in databases and identification was done indirectly based on available published data [8].

41

Majority of studies identify UDMH transformation products by a library search of the MS-spectra

42

database. At the same time, a database search in around 20% of times shows an incorrect result even if the

43

mass spectrum is available in the database. Nevertheless, the structure elucidation of isomeric compounds

44

based only on their fragmentation pattern, may sometimes not be feasible, since they produce common

45

fragments and the reference standards are not always available [9]. At the moment many substances known

46

as possible UDMH transformation products are not available in any databases [7,10]. Only several works

47

use standards [11] and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [10,12]. At the same time, even the use of high-

48

resolution MS [3,13] does not allow to assume a possible structure, since tens of thousands of possible

49

structures with different properties can correspond to the brutto-formula. GC retention index (RI) can be

50

used as an additional factor to confirm or reject candidates during GC-MS identification [14]. However,

51

reference RIs are available for less than half of the compounds in the NIST database, and reference RIs are

52

not available for most UDMH transformation products [15]. This problem can be partially solved by

53

predicting RI using machine learning [16]. During the last decade prediction of RIs with machine learning

54

has been applied more and more widely to the problems of non-targeted analysis in environmental

55

chemistry [17–22]

56

The work of our team demonstrated the successful use of a combination of high-performance liquid

57

chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) and GC-MS with artificial intelligence

58

techniques to cross-check the proposed structures of new UDMH transformation products [7,15]. However,

59

here we would like to highlight a very important nuance that machine learning is conducted on known

60

databases, including NIST, and the accuracy of prediction directly depends on the correctness of the

61

available values. Khrisanfov et al. developed a novel approach to find potentially erroneous entries in a

62

large-scale database with mostly unique entries [23]. The authors [14,24] also raise concerns that some RI

63

values in the database may be erroneous. RI filtering in the NIST database is an important task because

64

about 80% of the data have only one RI value per stationary phase (SP) [23]. Identifying incorrect entries

65

will improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models.

66

Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare experimental, reference (from the NIST database)

67

and predicted RIs obtained for different SP for possible UDMH transformation products. The experimental

68

RI and predicted RI were compared with those available in the literature. This approach is presented for the

69

first time on the example of UDMH transformation identification. For this purpose, standards of substances

70

were selected that are or are suspected to be UDMH transformation products or may be structurally similar

71

to its transformation products. Standard SP for the analysis of UDMH transformation products were chosen

for the experiment. Different types of SP ranging from non-polar (RTx-5MS) [25,26], mid-polar (DB-1701)

73

[27,28] to polar (HP-INNOWax) [29,30] have been used for the analysis earlier. It is required to obtain

74

experimental GC RI for these compounds at different SP and compare the obtained values with those

75

available in the literature and predicted by machine learning methods. The obtained data will allow to enrich

76

the databases, which will subsequently improve the accuracy of GC RI prediction. Also, the data obtained

77

by us can be used to adjust the identification methods of unknown UDMH transformation products, which

78

will allow to make a more precise assessment of UDMH and its transformation product impact on the

79

environment.

2.3 GC-MS

114

A Shimadzu GCMS-TQ8040 system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) was used to perform

115

GC-MS analysis. GC-MS parameters for HP-INNOWax were used as follows: an injection volume of

116

0.7 μL, a sample injection temperature of 250 °C, a split injection mode with a ratio of 1:10, and a carrier

117

gas flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. Temperature program: 3 min at 40 °C, ramping the temperature to 240 °C

118

at a rate of 8 °C/min, then 51 min at 240 °C; ion source temperature 200 °C and scanning range

119

40–650 m/z.

120
121

The conditions used for RTx-5MS —flow rate: 1.0 mL/min; a split injection mode with a ratio of
1:5; program: 3 min at 50 °C, then ramping to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, then 3 min at 300 °C.

122

GC-MS parameters for DB-1701 were used as follows: an injection volume of 0.7 μL, a sample

123

injection temperature of 250 °C, a split injection mode with a ratio of 1:10, and a carrier gas flow rate of

124

2.1 mL/min. Temperature program: 3 min at 40 °C, ramping the temperature to 260 °C at a rate of

125

8 °C/min, then 5 min at 260 °C; ion source temperature 200 °C and scanning range 40–600 m/z.

126

Each sample was injected two or three times. The NIST 17 (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)

127

database was used for the library search. The injector needle was cleaned with solvent (isopropanol or

128

hexane) five times before and five times after each injection.

129
130

2.4 Retention indices

131

Retention indices (RIs) for GC were first described by Kovats [32] for isothermal conditions and

132

then modified by Van den Dool and Kratz [33] for the temperature-programmed GC. Linear RI and

133

isothermal RI based on n-alkanes were used in this work. A linear RI was calculated based on the

134

following equation [34]:

135

𝑅𝐼 = 100 ∗ ( 𝑡

136
137
138

𝑁+(𝑡𝑥 −𝑡𝑁 )
),
𝑁+1 −𝑡𝑁

where RI is the retention index, tN, tN+1– RT of two n-alkanes with n and n+1 carbon atoms
respectively (CNH2N+2 and CN+1H2N+4), tx – RT of the considered compound, tN < tx < tN+1.
GC-MS RIs were predicted using a previously published multimodal machine learning method,

139

more details can be found in previous works [14,15].

140

2.5 Analytical reproducibility

141

To control the obtained results of the experimental RIs calculation, the index calculations were

142

performed 2 times with a 1-month interval for each SP. As a result, 4 to 6 values of experimental retention

143

indices were obtained for each target analyte. The difference in measured RI values did not exceed ∼5-7

144

units in all cases. The uncertainties in the library RI were larger: the previously reported value of the RI

145

median error in the library was ∼11 units, however, the library contained multiple incorrect values with

146

errors greatly exceeding ∼11 [23,35].

3.1 Non-polar stationary phase

149

The non-polar SP has the most data on RIs. Although the polar SP is more often used for nitrogen-

150

containing UDMH transformation products [36], a number of studies used non-polar columns to analyze

151

one of the most toxic UDMH transformation products, N-nitrosodimethylamine [26,37]. Furthermore,

152

non-polar 5% phenyl polydimethylsiloxane columns were also used for UDMH transformation products

153

before [38–40]. Therefore, obtaining experimental RIs for the non-polar SP is of interest. Table 2

154

summarizes the obtained experimental RIs available in the NIST database as well as the predicted RIs.

Table 2 shows that, even for such a common stationary phase as non-polar, the RI values for

161

UDMH transformation products in the NIST database are very limited. It is worth noting the discrepancies

162

between RIexp and NIST value for such substances as imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, and 1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-

163

amine. For these compounds there are single records of RI in the NIST database. It will be the object of

164

a special research by the authors. It should be noted that for such compounds as 1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-amine

165

and 4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole it was not possible to select the elution conditions (flow rate, concentration

166

of analyte) so that the substances came out with a narrow chromatographic peak. The peaks corresponding

167

to the retention of these components had a very blurred profile (Figure S1). In the study where the index

168

for 1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-amine was calculated [41], there were no chromatograms to compare the obtained

169

results.

170

It is interesting to compare the RI values obtained for the target analytes with previously

171

suggested UDMH transformation products without using standards. Thus, the structures of possible

172

UDMH transformation products were proposed earlier in studies using GC-MS, HPLC-HRMS and

173

machine learning methods [7,15]. Among the proposed candidates as possible transformation products

174

were the following: 1-methylpyrazole (766), 3-methylpyrazole (941), 1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole (852),

175

3,5-dimethylpyrazole (1025), and 1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile (1187). Experimental

176

retention indices for the proposed candidates from that paper are presented in parentheses [7]. Comparison

177

with the values presented above (Table 2) showed the coincidence of the experimental RIs for the

178

referenced standards and for the structures proposed by the authors. 1,3-Dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-

179

carbonitrile was first mentioned in the work as a UDMH transformation product [15]. Authors using the

180

presented algorithm rejected proposed candidates generated by the NIST database (more details in the

181

work [15]) and, including the predicted RI, suggested 1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile as a

182

possible candidate. One of candidates in this case was 2-amino-4-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile,

183

which is an isomer of 1,3-dimethyl-1H-Pyrazole-4-carbonitrile and only the RI can distinguish them,

184

since the isomers have the same mass spectral characteristics but different chromatographic patterns. The

185

experimental RIs presented in Table 2 will be useful for further identification of the UDMH

186

transformation products as well as other nitrogen-containing mixtures, since RIs in the databases are

187

limited even for such simple molecules. Furthermore, the available indices in the database may be

188

erroneous and require additional verification, as noted above and earlier by other authors [23,35]. The

189

provided experimental RIs will not only identify new and/or confirm those proposed in the literature, but

190

can also be used to correct erroneous entries in the NIST database, thus correcting the retention index

191

prediction and improving the prediction accuracy.

192

In addition, there are 3 compounds from the listed substances with mass spectra not available in

193

the database. One of them, 2-formyl-1,1-dimethylhydrazine, which is a UDMH transformation product,

194

was described in several studies [8,12,42]. Substances such as 2-methyl-1H-imidazole-1-propanamine

195

and 5-ethyl-1H-pyrazole-3-amine may be transformation products, but because their mass spectra are not

196

available in Nist17, their identification may be extremely difficult. Their mass spectra are presented in

197

Fig. 1.

202

Adding mass spectra to the NIST database is also important for more accurate prediction of mass

203

spectra by machine learning methods. If there is no mass spectrum in the database, then predicting the

204

mass spectra of the candidate structure and comparing it with the experimental one can be very useful to

205

further identify and weed out the false candidate.

207

One of the most common SPs for analyzing nitrogen-containing UDMH transformation products

208

is the polar phase [8,29,30,39]. However, for polar SP, reference experimental RI is available for

209

approximately 10,000 compounds, which is several times less than for non-polar SP [43]. This fact makes

210

identification very difficult in the absence of standards, which makes RI prediction for polar SP an

211

important task. Table 3 summarizes the experimentally obtained RI, predicted RI, and RI values published

212

in NIST, when available, for the polar SP.

Table 3 shows that there are even fewer known retention indices on the polar phase for the UDMH

216

transformation products than for the nonpolar phase. We also found discrepancies in retention indices

217

with the available data for 3,5-dimethylpyrazole and 3-methylpyrazole. Zellner et al. [34] reported that

218

the reproducibility of retention indices between different laboratories was usually within 10 –50 index

219

units for polar phases. They stated that the large range of units for polar columns could be related to the

220

heterogeneity between columns manufactured by different companies, the misuse of the gas

221

chromatographic technique, a possible reactivity between the analyte and the stationary phase, and the

222

absence of an analytical reproducibility, as most publications do not report data on analysis performed in

223

duplicate or triplicate. The total absence of RI values for such classes of substances as triazoles, pyrazoles

224

and, to a lesser extent, imidazoles results in predicted RIs, even for simple molecules, being significantly

225

different from the experimental ones, although the patterns of their retention are preserved. This is

226

particularly evident for the substituted triazoles, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and 4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole.

227

This result shows the necessity of obtaining correct RI data even for such simple structures, which will

228

significantly increase the reliability of retention index prediction.

229

3.3 Mid-polar stationary phase

230

Mid-polarity SP columns are rarely used to analyze UDMH transformation products, but mid-

231

polar columns (DB-1701) were used to analyze N-nitrosodimethylamine [27,28]. There are also very few

232

data on RIs for mid-polarity SP, which makes columns with this phase an interesting object for such

233

studies. Based on our results, we can conclude that the mid-polar column (DB-1701) has the best

234

separating ability in relation to a complex mixture of UDMH transformation products. Thus, substances

235

such as 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and 4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole, which had blurred chromatographic

236

profiles on HP-INNOWax and RTx-5MS, came out with good chromatographic peaks on DB-1701

237

(Figure S2). Figure 2 shows the chromatogram of one of the selected mixtures of the target analytes with

238

a mixture of alkanes. In Table 2, the results of calculation and prediction of retention indices for the

239

studied compounds are shown.

Table 4 shows that the predicted RIs for the selected analytes correlated well with the

245

experimental data, which we did not predict. The better convergence for the RIs for the mid-polar SP

246

compared to the polar stationary phase can probably be explained by the fact that for this SP there are

247

fewer RIs values and therefore fewer erroneous values. Also, for 4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole, the largest

248

discrepancy between the RI and the experimental one is observed for the nonpolar and polar phases as

249

well.

250

4. Conclusions

251

For the first time, retention indices were calculated for some confirmed and assumed UDMH

252

transformation products for 3 different stationary phases - polar (HP-INNOWax), non-polar (RTx-5MS)

253

and medium polarity (DB-1701). In this work, for the first time, an approach was used where experimental

254

retention indices and predicted retention indices were compared with those available in the literature. For

255

a large number of confirmed UDMH transformation products there are no published values of retention

256

indices even for the non-polar phase. However, it should be noted that in the course of this study some

257

discrepancies were found with the records in the NIST database for the polar and nonpolar phases.

258

Erroneous values greatly affect the accuracy of the prediction, especially when the database is small, as

259

seen in the polar phase example. The predicted indices for the mid-polar stationary phase showed good

260

convergence with the experimental data. It is also worth noting that this phase showed the best separation

261

ability compared to the polar and non-polar phases, and these phases should be used to analyze UDMH

262

transformation products. The obtained data will allow to enrich the databases, which will subsequently

263

improve the accuracy of GC RI prediction. Our results can be used in non-target screening to adjust the

264

identification of compounds of emerging concerns that are not available as reference standards. This

265

approach would provide, by establishing the right structure, a more accurate assessment of the

266

environmental impact of UDMH and its transformation products.
