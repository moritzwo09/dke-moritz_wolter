Abstract

26
27

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a persistent and mobile substance that has been increasing in

28

concentrations within diverse environmental media, including rain, soils, human serum, plants,

29

plant-based foods, and drinking water. Currently, TFA concentrations are orders of magnitude

30

higher than those of other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This accumulation is

31

due to many PFAS having TFA as a transformation product, including several fluorinated

32

gases (F-gases), pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, in addition to direct

33

release of industrially produced TFA. Due to TFA’s extreme persistence and ongoing

34

emissions, concentrations are increasing irreversibly. What remains less clear is the

35

thresholds where irreversible effects on local or global scales occur. There are indications from

36

mammalian toxicity studies that TFA is toxic to reproduction and that it exhibits liver toxicity.

37

Ecotoxicity data are scarce, with most data for aquatic systems; fewer data are available for

38

terrestrial plants, where TFA bioaccumulates most readily. Collectively, these trends imply that

39

TFA meets the criteria of a planetary boundary threat for novel entities because of increasing

40

planetary-scale exposure, where potential, irreversible disruptive impacts on vital earth system

41

processes could occur. The rational response to this is to instigate binding actions to reduce

42

emissions of TFA and its many precursors.

Introduction

53

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) belongs to the subclass of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances

54

(PFAS) known as ultra-short chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). TFA is by far the most

55

abundant PFAS in the environment1–6. Neuwald et al. demonstrated that TFA accounted for

56

more than 90% of the total PFAS mass (of 46 individual PFAS analyzed) in various drinking

57

water sources in Germany2. Tian et al. observed that concentrations of TFA and

58

perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) in air, dry-deposition particles and plant leaves surrounding

59

two landfills in China were an order of magnitude higher than those of the 21 other PFAS

60

analyzed4. Chen et al. measured 25 PFAS around two fluorochemical manufacturing plants in

61

China, covering 8 different media (air, various water, soil, dust, plant leaves, sediment), with

62

TFA concentrations being consistently 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those of other

63

PFAS5.

64

An initial wave of scientific interest in the environmental fate and effects of TFA started around

65

the mid-1990s, due to novel fluorinated refrigerants (hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and

66

hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)) being introduced to the market after the ozone-depleting

67

chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were phased out under the 1987 Montreal Protocol on

68

Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer7–12. Many of the fluorinated refrigerants are referred

69

to as F-gases (encompassing gases with R-CF3 moiety, R-CF2-R moiety or inorganic

70

fluorides). When F-gases or other fluorinated organic substances contain a C−CF3 moiety that

71

is resistant to biochemical or photochemical degradation, TFA will commonly show up as a

72

terminal degradation product. In recent years, interest in TFA has been re-established due to

73

rapidly increasing concentrations observed in remote locations, as well as its ubiquity in

74

drinking water sources and human blood2,13–15.

75

Since the 1990s, it has been suggested that hazard-related concerns of TFA and other short-

76

chain PFAAs are much lower than those of PFAAs with longer perfluoroalkyl chains, which are

77

more bioaccumulative in lipids and generally more toxic 8,9,16–23. However, these early reports

78

did not consider TFA’s ubiquitous accumulation in the environment, in particular its observed

79

accumulation in water resources and bioaccumulation in plants and crops. Although there are

80

fewer toxicological data compared to long-chain PFAAs, we maintain that there are more than

81

sufficient data to conclude that TFA poses a risk to humans and the environment and meets

82

the criteria of a planetary boundary threat for novel entities24–27. We will present evidence for

83

this based on TFA’s 1) increasing planetary exposure, which is 2) irreversible and

84

accumulating due to emissions from many sources and could thereby cause 3) long-lasting

85

disruptive effects on human health and vital earth system processes. Our analysis leads to

86

the conclusion that policy, industry initiatives, and innovation actions should be enacted

87

globally to reduce TFA emissions as soon as possible and to protect future generations from

88

potential irreversible effects of TFA accumulation.

91

Increasing planetary exposure

92

A review of the scientific literature was conducted to obtain an overview of average and

93

maximum concentrations in diverse environmental media (see Supporting Information (SI) for

94

a full methodology and collected data). In brief, 43 studies reporting on TFA concentrations

95

spanning from the late 1990s to the 2020s were selected and monitoring data were analyzed.

96

Collectively, these data indicate that TFA exposure is widespread and increasing.

97

Recent median concentrations of TFA in precipitation were measured at 0.29 µg/L in the

98

USA28, 0.21 µg/L in Germany29 and 0.70 µg/L in Fuxin, China5. The median drinking water

99

concentrations reported in the recent peer-reviewed literature vary from 0.08 µg/L in the USA

100

(Indiana)18 to 1.5 µg/L in Germany2, and 0.23 µg/L in samples from 19 different countries other

101

than Germany30. This has relevance in conversations related to TFA being included within

102

regulatory definitions of “total PFAS”. These median concentrations are either similar to or

103

higher than the proposed limits of total PFAS in drinking water in the EU draft recast Drinking

104

Water Directive31, which places a threshold of 0.5 µg/L for total PFAS.32 A recent report

105

measuring TFA in European surface water and groundwater recorded an exceedance of the

106

0.5 µg/L threshold in 79% of the samples, with more than 98% of the detected mass of total

107

PFAS being TFA32. A Swiss study reported detecting TFA in 560 out of 564 drinking water

108

samples in 2023, with 69% of the concentrations above 0.5 µg/L, among which were 2

109

samples with TFA concentrations above 9 µg/L and 75 between 1 and 9 µg/L33.

110

If there is TFA contamination in soil or water, short and ultrashort PFAAs undergo rapid uptake

111

and bioaccumulation in crops and other plants, particularly in their aerial compartments34–37.

112

Chen et al.5 detected concentrations of up to 3800 mg/kgdw of TFA in plants in the vicinity of a

113

fluorochemical industrial site in China with an average field bioaccumulation factor of 13,000.

114

In general, TFA has been enriching in conifer needles5,38, maize,5,39 leaves of various tree

115

species4,5 and some wetland species40. Consequently, high concentrations of TFA in plant-

116

based foods41 and plant-based beverages such as juice42, beer and tea30 were reported,

117

indicating that the ingestion of plant-based foods and beverages could be a significant route

118

for human (and animal) exposure.

119

TFA was detected in human blood from China43 with median concentrations of 8.46 µg/L,

120

similar to the levels of long-chain PFAAs, although TFA is not considered bioaccumulative

121

according to regulatory criteria (which typically refer to bioaccumulation in aquatic species

122

entering the food chain and not to bioaccumulation in plants)44. A similar study in the USA

123

reported a median of 6 µg/L and a maximum of 77 µg/L18, where TFA alone had a 57%

124

contribution to the total mass of 39 detected PFAS in human serum. Thus, the concentrations

125

of TFA in non-occupationally exposed US citizens are similar to the concentrations of

126

bioaccumulative legacy long-chain PFAAs (e.g., PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA) measured in

127

the serum of occupationally exposed workers45. Because of high uptake, TFA reaches levels

128

in human serum that are much higher than its low bioaccumulation potential in aquatic species

129

would indicate.

130

To demonstrate the change in concentrations and trends over the years, Figure 1 presents a

131

comparison of pre-2010 and post-2010 data (by the reported year of sampling, not the year of

132

publication). This cut-off year of 2010 was chosen because there was a slump of interest in

133

TFA in the peer-reviewed literature between the years 2008 to 2012. Prior to this time,

134

research on TFA attracted attention in relation to the introduction of F-gases around the late

135

1990s to replace CFCs. In more recent years, TFA has attracted increased attention due to it

136

more commonly being included and detected during PFAS monitoring campaigns. The 1st of

137

January 2010 also coincides with the final deadline for stopping the last remaining production

138

of CFCs46; even though the transition to F-gases occurred much before this time.15

measured concentrations (see Table S1 for the full data set and Figure S3 for air data presented as concentrations

147

148

When pre- and post-2010 concentration data are available in a specific medium (Figure 1) an

149

increase in TFA by over an order of magnitude in both maximum and mean concentrations in

150

several environmental compartments is evident, including for precipitation, rivers and streams,

151

groundwater, drinking water, soil and plants. While atmospheric media were the main focus of

152

monitoring studies dated pre-2010 (especially precipitation), more data from other media

153

became available after this cut-off year – with new media relevant to human exposure (e.g.,

154

plant-based beverages, crops, indoor and outdoor dust, human serum), ecosystem exposure

155

(e.g., animals such as locusts, autochthonous tree species) as well as other media that were

156

rarely measured before (e.g., drinking water). Detailed figures with concentrations across

157

different media are available in the SI (Figures S1-S4).

158

More detailed time trends are available in specific locations. Urban surface waters around

159

Beijing were sampled in 200247, and resampled in 201248, showing up to a 17-fold increase in

160

TFA concentrations over 10 years, while tap water detections went from non-detection to 0.16

161

µg/L in 201248. Freeling et al. reported an increase in wet deposition in Germany from 22 to

162

30 t/year during 1995–1996 to 68 to 98 t/year in 201929. Pickard et al. used dated Arctic ice

163

cores to show a rapid increase in deposited TFA after the entry into force of the Montreal

164

Protocol, from non-detection or a few ng/L in segments before 1989 to 0.13 and 0.15 µg/L in

165

segments dated 2015 and 2017, respectively15. In 2021, Cahill et al. reported a 6-fold increase

166

in TFA in a stream transect in California since 199849. Freeling et al. analyzed archived leaf

167

samples of different tree species for TFA and observed increases by factors of up to 12.5 in

168

TFA concentrations in some species from 1989 to 202050. A study in indoor and outdoor dust

169

found a four-fold increase in TFA between 2013 and 201751.

170

An irreversible burden from multiple sources of emissions.

171
172

Based on its persistence and high mobility due to lack of sorption13,52, TFA’s ultimate recipient

173

is the Earth’s hydrosphere. As TFA is omnipresent in all water bodies, from groundwater,

174

oceanic water, ice cores, drinking water to bottled water1,2,15,30,48,53–55, dilution in many ways

175

has already occurred, with the only substantial remaining dilution medium being the deep

176

ocean. Similarly, enrichment in plants will follow constantly increasing TFA concentrations, as

177

water and soil concentrations increase. With limited processes for elimination from plant

178

tissues because of TFA’s persistence (no biotransformation) and its lack of volatility (as it is a

179

strong acid in water and fully ionized), constant passive uptake from soil pore water via the

180

transpiration stream can be expected for the lifetime of the plant as long as there is an input

181

of TFA available. This theory is supported by findings for other short- and ultrashort-chain

182

PFAAs36 and is in agreement with the results by Zhang et al.56, who did not observe a steady-

183

state concentration being reached for TFA in their wheat experiments.

184

Exposure of TFA from agricultural and other ecosystems has not been assessed as it has for

185

other, longer-chain PFAAs57–62; however, it is inevitable that with increasing emissions on the

186

global scale, the mean TFA concentrations in humans (serum), animals and plants will

187

increase. The only potential environmentally relevant pathways of TFA degradation are

188

overtone photodissociation in the troposphere and biologically catalyzed conversion

189

processes that convert TFA to fluoroform (CF3H).63 This is likely negligible in terms of TFA

190

mass loss, as TFA is readily scavenged from the atmosphere by wet (and to a lower extent,

191

dry) deposition, before it spreads rapidly in the terrestrial hydrosphere.12,48,64 Nevertheless,

192

considering the high TFA concentrations, even a low conversion of TFA to fluoroform may have

193

an observable impact on atmospheric fluoroform concentrations63. Methods to remove TFA

194

from water are expensive and often inefficient due to TFA’s persistence and mobility53,65–67. In

195

some cases, water purification methods as common as ozonation and chlorination are also a

196

source of TFA, depending on the presence of TFA-precursors53. The most effective solution

197

would be reverse osmosis (RO) to up-concentrate TFA, followed by some intensive destruction

198

techniques. However, RO treatment of water, particularly wastewater, compared to other forms

199

of water treatment is expensive,68,69 requires a substantial amount of energy70 and typically

200

results in 50% water loss71. The necessity of RO for water treatment is also in contradiction to

201

Article 7(3) of the EU’s Water Framework Directive, which states “Member States shall ensure

8

202

the necessary protection for the bodies of water identified with the aim of avoiding deterioration

203

in their quality in order to reduce the level of purification treatment required in the production

204

of drinking water”72. Destructive techniques for concentrated TFA, such as incinerating RO

205

concentrates or even biomass containing TFA, may lead to harmful byproducts, including

206

fluoroform (which is a potent greenhouse gas with a GWP of 14,800 times that of CO2 over

207

100 years).63,73

208

We have mentioned above that one source of increasing TFA concentrations is the increased

209

use of F-gases used as refrigerant chemicals; it is worth looking into this in more detail.

210

Refrigerant chemicals have a history of being problematic. CFCs were originally introduced

211

as “safer”, alternative refrigerants to ammonia, sulfur dioxide and methyl chloride, until it was

212

discovered that CFCs were volatile enough to reach the stratosphere and release Cl radicals

213

that lead to the decomposition of stratospheric ozone, particularly over Antarctica74–76. In this

214

manner, CFCs were a planetary boundary threat associated with severe impacts77. To protect

215

the ozone layer from poorly reversible depletion, the Montreal Protocol78 required CFCs used

216

in refrigeration and air conditioning systems to be substituted with HCFCs and HFCs79 or

217

natural refrigerants. HCFCs have lower ozone depletion potential than CFCs, and HFCs have

218

no ozone depletion potential; however, HFCs have a high global warming potential (GWP)79.

219

Further amendments to the Montreal Protocol and the European F-gas Regulation aimed to

220

replace the high-GWP F-gases with low-GWP alternatives80. Nevertheless, the substances

221

proposed as replacements – hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) and even currently applied HFCs –

222

add to the problem because many HFOs and HFCs can be either partially (e.g. HFC-134a,

223

HFC-143a, HFC-1234ze, HCFO-1233zd) or completely (e.g., HFC-227ea, HFO-1225ye(E),

224

HFO-1225ye(Z), u-HCFC-1224yd(Z) and HFO-1234yf) transformed to TFA81,82. The use of

225

HFO-1234yf was estimated to be responsible for 6900 t/year emissions of TFA in 2020 in the

226

EU alone, with a potential increase in emissions up to 47,650 t/year by 205081. This shift in F-

227

gases could cause emissions of TFA to increase by orders of magnitude in the coming years81,

228

along with a corresponding contribution to climate impacts due to the formation of more

229

fluoroform from TFA in the troposphere63.

230

Another major source of TFA is direct emissions from industrial production and processes. For

231

example, TFA is registered under EU’s Regulation 1907/2006 on Registration, Evaluation,

232

Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as manufactured and/or imported into

233

the EU in volumes ranging from 100 to 1000 tons per year.52 Additionally, TFA is used as an

234

intermediate, but this usage does not require registration of production volumes. Xie et al.

235

measured TFA in the surrounding environment (surface water, groundwater, air, dust, soil) of

236

three fluorochemical plants near Jinan, China, that manufacture inorganic fluorine products,

237

TFA and fluoride-containing intermediates.83 Whereas Xie et al. reported surface water

238

concentrations up to a maximum of 2.6 µg/L.83, concentrations up to 7500 µg/L were recently

239

reported in surface water of the river Arias in the vicinity of a production plant producing TFA

240

and related PFAS in Southern France.84,85

241

In addition to F-gases and direct TFA production83–85, there are several other precursors

242

contributing to the accumulation of TFA in the environment, including a variety of groups of

243

chemicals containing the C−CF3 moiety, such as agrochemicals53,86–88, pharmaceuticals53,

244

(fluoro)polymers89–91 and other PFAS13,53,92. TFA and its precursors can be emitted from point

245

sources such as the (fluoro)chemical industry5,53, wastewater treatment plants, landfills4,93,94,

246

and sites with a history of the use of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs)93,95. The German

247

Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) published estimates for TFA emissions from

248

sources in Germany96. The available data indicate that refrigerants and blowing agents were

249

the largest quantifiable source of TFA with emissions at ~2000 t/year in Germany, followed by

250

pesticides at ~457 t/year (mainly flufenacet, diflufenican and fluazinam), and human

251

pharmaceuticals at ~29 t/year. Emissions from other sources, such as direct production of

252

TFA, biocides, veterinary pharmaceuticals, and fluorochemicals in products could not be

253

quantified in that study96. There have been speculations about natural sources of TFA, but

254

these have been discredited by Joudan et al.97, who demonstrated that only increasing

255

anthropogenic sources of TFA can explain its exponential increase in recent decades. A source

256

of TFA that has been recognized since the 1990s and is garnering increasing attention is the

257

transformation products from the thermal destruction of fluoropolymers,98 as well as treatment

258

of PFAS by destruction methods53,99,100. TFA formation yields of diverse PFAS destruction

259

methods are often unknown and this should therefore be investigated when developing new

260

destruction methods for PFAS16. TFA has been dubbed a “Substance from Multiple Sources”

261

by Nödler and Scheurer101, highlighting the difficulty in ascertaining the main sources of TFA

262

in monitoring studies of water resources14,19

263
264

Disruptive Effects on Human Health and Earth System Processes

265

There may be disruptive effects of TFA on human health or on Earth system processes that

266

are currently unknown, similar to how the effects of longer-chain PFAAs on human health, and

267

CFCs on the ozone layer, were initially unknown by the broader scientific and regulatory

268

community. Overcoming this ignorance is the hardest part of understanding that a certain

269

novel entity that is irreversibly increasing in concentrations globally may pose a planetary

270

boundary threat25. Such effects cannot be fully described or anticipated by established

271

paradigms of hazard and risk assessment. However, as those paradigms are commonly used

272

in defining regulatory human and ecosystem health thresholds for chemicals, this is where we

273

start our analysis of TFA potentially causing a disruptive impact on a planetary scale.

274

Known health and environmental thresholds.

275

A recent review by Dekant and Dekant17 summarized the mammalian toxicity of TFA, referring

276

specifically to human toxicity. Most toxicity tests on which human health risk assessments

277

were based are rat studies, which found mild liver hypertrophy (increased size of the liver) as

278

the lead effect at concentrations > 1000 mg/kgbw. More human-relevant tests directed towards

279

a mechanistic understanding and not only towards filling regulatory apical endpoints should

280

the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) to classify TFA

282

and its salts under Category 1B: Presumed human reproductive toxicant, based on new

283

evidence of embryo-fetal developmental toxicity in rabbits, submitted to the European

284

Chemicals Agency (ECHA) by Germany52,102,103. If TFA were to be classified as toxic for

285

reproduction, this could have an impact on future threshold values in food and drinking water.

286

In 2020, Germany established a human-health guideline value for TFA in drinking water at 60

287

µg/L, which is based on a chronic rat toxicity (feeding) study, but emphasized that the

288

concentration in drinking water should be kept as low as reasonably possible and a value of

289

10 µg/L should be targeted104. In 2023, the Netherlands derived indicative drinking water value

290

for TFA at 2.2 ug/L, based on the potency factor relative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and

291

its threshold for drinking water.105 Considering that the mean and maximum TFA

292

concentrations in German drinking water sources were recently measured at 0.9 and 12.4

293

µg/L,2 respectively, it is plausible that drinking water concentrations in many areas have or will

294

exceed the 2.2 µg/L threshold in the near future.

295

Under the EU’s CLP, TFA is classified as harmful to aquatic life with long-lasting effects

296

(H412)106. Under REACH, the toxicological threshold for the general population (Derived No

297

Effect Level, DNEL) is derived only for the oral route and set to 0.042 mg/kgbw/day, while for

298

other routes of exposure, no hazard has been assumed and concluded. The threshold for the

299

oral route was derived based on the observed effects from a 90-day rat-feeding study52.

300

Human toxicokinetic evaluation of TFA showed rapid oral absorption, submission to

301

enterohepatic circulation, and body distribution via blood which included passing through the

302

placenta barrier. The main excretion routes are considered to be via urine and bile.52 Although

303

TFA is not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria referring to aquatic organisms52 ,

304

internal concentrations may increase due to continuous accumulation in exposure media, such

305

as drinking water and plant-based food and beverages. Contrary to the most recent human

306

toxicological review17, a similar recent review is not available for (eco)toxicity data. Under CLP,

307

TFA currently falls under the hazard classification “chronic 3” (H412), which indicates long-

308

term harmful effects for water-dwelling organisms52. We conducted a search of the USEPA

309

ECOTOX database107 and ECHA registration dossiers52 and found that most efforts towards

310

the determination of (eco)toxicity of TFA are from the 1990s. Algae are considered the most

311

sensitive trophic level, with S. capricornutum the most sensitive species and 120 µg/L the

312

lowest determined No-Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC), which was determined for the

313

TFA sodium salt (Solvay data, ECOTOX database extracted for TFA/NaTFA and reported in

314

Berends et al.8,107). Selected ecotoxicity endpoints (acute and chronic) for other organisms are

315

reported in Table S2 of the Supporting Information, with listed ecotoxicological thresholds and

316

their abbreviations. Overall, most of the testing was performed for acute toxicity, with only a

317

few studies investigating the chronic toxicity of TFA.

318

Predicted No-Effect Concentrations (PNECs) are concentration thresholds commonly derived

319

in environmental risk assessment that should be protective of the whole ecosystem. They are

320

based on ecotoxicity data and extrapolation factors based on data abundance, test duration

321

(acute/chronic), and data quality/uncertainty108. For TFA, the lowest PNEC of 0.12 µg/L was

322

derived by Xie et al.83 and was based on algae that were previously shown as the most

323

sensitive trophic level. The PNEC of 0.12 µg/L was derived from a NOEC of 120 µg/L by using

324

an uncertainty factor of 1000, chosen because of the scarcity of (eco)toxicity data in the peer-

325

reviewed literature and because extrapolation to the marine environment requires extra

326

precaution (typically by a factor 10 compared to freshwater). The ECHA REACH dossier

327

reports a freshwater PNEC of 560 µg/L and a marine water PNEC of 56 µg/L, both based on

328

the algal study reporting the 72h ErC10 (EC10 based on growth rate) of 5600 µg/L 52. Almost

329

all surface water median and/or mean concentrations from peer-review studies reported as

330

post-2010 already exceed the precautionary PNEC of 0.12 µg/L as derived by Xie et al.83

331

(Table S1, Figure S2), while the NOEC of 120 µg/L and ECHA’s PNEC of 560 µg/L are

332

exceeded by some recently detected maximum freshwater/surface water values84,85.

333

Among terrestrial organisms (ecotoxicity studies), only crop plants were tested for TFA toxicity.

334

The final short-term EC50 was 4.7 mg/kg soil dry weight and a long-term NOEC was 0.83

335

mg/kg soil dry weight. It was mostly the plant shoot growth that was affected52. Further testing

336

of TFA plant toxicity is needed, due to the scarcity of plant toxicity studies with sufficiently high

337

internal plant concentrations and including other vascular plants than crops. 13 However, the

338

long-term NOEC determined in crops52 is already similar to soil TFA background

339

concentrations and is several orders of magnitude lower than TFA soil concentrations in

340

contamination hotspots (Figure 1, Figure S4)5,39.

341

Given the persistence of TFA, exposure to TFA should be considered chronic and life-long for

342

all species. However, chronic studies are still relatively scarce, with chronic data from

343

standardized tests being limited in time of exposure to, for example, 35 days in fish, 21 days

344

in Daphnia, 90 days in rats, or 36 days in crop plants52 (Table S2, SI), which are insufficient in

345

their extrapolation to potential impacts from lifetime exposure to TFA. Hence, none of the

346

current studies considered actual long-term exposure to TFA, which would be more relevant

347

given its ubiquitous and increasing presence over long time scales.

348

In contrast to the analysis above, other authors109,110 recently concluded the risk of TFA to

349

humans and the environment is de minimis (i.e. negligible) based on examples like a projected

350

concentration of TFA in the ocean of 0.2 µg/L by 2100 compared to the NOEC in the algae R.

351

subcapitata of 2500 µg/L109,110, as well the median human serum levels of 8.46 µg/L in the

352

serum and staff of Nankai University being 4 orders of magnitude below effect doses in rats.

353

However, we disagree that these are sufficient data to conclude de minimis risk, considering

354

that the conclusion ignores terrestrial environments, assumes the lowest measured

355

environmental effect levels are known despite lack of long-term chronic exposure data for

356

other species, and does not consider diverse human exposure pathways in the context of

357

increasing diet concentrations and potential unknown adverse effects. Given the persistence

358

and accumulation of TFA, there could be other, unknown environmental and health impacts

359

for which the current science is ignorant.

360

Unknown environmental and health impacts

361

As TFA is accumulating in diverse ecosystems, researchers should focus on non-traditional

362

exposure and impact pathways that affect biogeochemical processes. Despite the extremely

363

high plant uptake of TFA, controlled uptake experiments were rarely performed and reported

364

for TFA. Zhang et al.56 performed a set of hydroponic experiments with TFA and other ultra-

365

short and short PFCAs. Here, the root uptake was exceptionally high for TFA when compared

366

to other PFCAs, e.g., the root concentration factor of TFA was >1600 L/kg 56, two orders of

367

magnitude higher than usually determined for PFCAs with 3-5 perfluorinated carbons (CFx) in

368

similar experiments111–113. Chen et al.5 found a similar pattern for chain length dependence of

369

PFCAs. The field-based soil-water distribution coefficients (Kd) – Kds were higher than

370

expected for TFA (and PFPrA), demonstrating a trend opposite of the commonly observed and

371

reported Kd decrease from 11CFx to 3CFx of PFCAs and PFSAs114–117. This indicates that the

372

interface partitioning of TFA and interactions with soils and plants need to be researched

373

further and accounted for in assessing its environmental fate and behavior properties,

374

particularly (bio)accumulation potential. Such research needs to be extended to agricultural

375

systems, such as the transfer from crops containing elevated levels of TFA to livestock (meat

376

and milk) and human diets, as well as a transfer of TFA from plants through diverse food webs,

377

similar to previous research on other PFAS58–61.

378

Direct effects of TFA on soil quality were only recently investigated.118 Effects on the soil pH,

379

microbial respiration, bacterial abundance and litter decomposition were reported, the latter

380

being affected at concentrations similar to current TFA concentrations in soil for contamination

381

hotspots as described in Chen et al5 (0.0013 – 2.4 mg/kgdw). Effects other than litter

382

decomposition were statistically significant only at high TFA concentrations (≥10 mg/kg) which

383

could be a result of acidity-related effects, as the pH significantly decreased at concentrations

384

of 10 mg/kg and higher (TFA in acid form was directly used in the testing)118. Bott and Standley

385

observed the incorporation of TFA into cells by microbial communities in freshwater surface

386

sediments119 after also demonstrating TFA incorporation in biomolecules such as proteins in
15

387

aquatic organisms spanning a range of trophic levels11. Concentrations that were used in these

388

~1.5 to 2.5-year experiments overlap with those currently observed in waters worldwide,

389

ranging from 2.2 to 43 µg/L, (Table S1, Figure S2, SI), and resulted in significant cell

390

incorporation of TFA119. It was also indicated that at elevated concentrations, the presence of

391

TFA in the atmosphere may influence aerosols and cloud formation, boosting the formation of

392

atmospheric clusters involved in new aerosol particle formation120,121. As concentrations of TFA

393

will likely increase by at least an order of magnitude in the coming decade, further

394

investigations of TFA on biogeochemical processes are warranted.

395
396

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS

397

Based on the data presented above, the increasing accumulation of TFA can be considered

398

to meet the three conditions of a planetary boundary threat122,123 for novel entities as defined

399

by Persson et al.:25 “Condition 1 (C1) – the pollution has a disruptive effect on a vital earth

400

system process of which we are ignorant; Condition 2 (C2) – the disruptive effect is not

401

discovered until the associated impacts are, or inevitably will be, manifested at a global scale;

402

and Condition 3 (C3) the impacts are poorly reversible because the level of pollution in the

403

global environment cannot be readily reduced…” Condition 1 (C1) is fulfilled based on the

404

many thresholds that could be exceeded of which we are ignorant; including surface water

405

concentrations 84,85 that exceed 83ECHA’s PNEC of 560 µg/L; soil concentrations that exceed

406

the lowest established NOEC (0.83 mg/kg soil)52; and, indications of human toxicity that have

407

led to precautionary thresholds in drinking water104. The existence of such health advisory and

408

regulatory values has been used as the basis for establishing C1 in relation to four PFAAs in

409

a previous study.27 The possibility of other long-term disruptive effects, which may be already

410

occurring, but which we are ignorant of, is further support for C1 being fulfilled, particularly

411

considering the absence of studies of TFA exposure in agricultural systems and diverse food

412

webs. Condition 2 (C2) is fulfilled as TFA is already present globally in all environmental media,

413

such as its ongoing bioaccumulation in vascular plants, the accumulation in arctic regions, its

414

ubiquity in groundwater, and the global occurrence of industrial sites that are TFA hotspots
16

415

where impacts are most likely; therefore, when impacts are discovered they would be global

416

impacts. Condition 3 (C3) is fulfilled as when effects are realized globally, they will be

417

irreversible for the foreseeable future, due to TFA’s extreme persistence and mobility, coupled

418

with emissions from multiple sources.

419

Although, currently, TFA does not have as well-established health advisories or regulatory

420

limits other PFAAs27, it is likely that new advisories/limits will be introduced in the coming years

421

as more research on the impacts of TFA emerges. With the projected exponential increase in

422

TFA concentrations in the environment 81, food and in humans, the question is not if TFA can

423

exceed a planetary boundary, but which irreversible health or Earth system impacts would be

424

first observed at a planetary scale, and where thresholds of TFA emissions should be set to

425

limit the severity of such impacts.

426

The potential long-term, irreversible impacts from the rapidly increasing emissions of TFA from

427

anthropogenic sources should be used as a rationale to start immediately discussing policy,

428

industry and innovation actions towards the phase-out of high-volume substances that lead to

429

increasing TFA accumulation. Obvious places to start would be to limit the direct production of

430

TFA, and more importantly, of TFA-precursors, such as HFOs (like HFO-1234yf)

431

pesticides such as flufenacet13,53,96. Other pharmaceuticals, veterinary products and industrial

432

chemicals that release TFA via transformation processes7 should also be considered for

433

phase-out or substitutions, following the principles of safe-and-sustainable by design124 and

434

essential use125 to avoid regrettable substitution126 to more hazardous substances. As

435

discussions and policy mechanisms to phase out the sources of TFA could take some time,

436

the rational response to the global threat posed by accumulating TFA is to act swiftly before

437

the irreversible impacts are manifested at a global scale to humans and the environment.

438

Transitioning away from TFA and its precursors is the most effective way of safeguarding

439

future generations from this planetary boundary threat.
