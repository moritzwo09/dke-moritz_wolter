Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is imperative to mitigating climate change1. Aqueous
amine solutions are the leading technology for CO2 separations2, but they suffer from chemical
instability under scrubbing conditions, corrosiveness, and toxicity, hindering their long-term
deployment3–5. Herein, we demonstrate that tertiary amine N-oxides, an oxidative degradation
product of amines6,7, can remove CO2 from dilute streams, including flue gas from a natural gasfired power plant. Extensive spectroscopic and computational studies support that the non-toxic,
non-corrosive, and inexpensive 4-methylmorpholine N-oxide (MMNO) captures CO2 under humid
conditions via the formation of a hydrogen-bond-stabilized bicarbonate (HCO3−) species, despite
being significantly less basic than an amine. MMNO exhibits improved oxidative and thermal
stability compared to structurally similar amines, highlighting the potential of N-oxides to
complement traditional amine-based scrubbers for industrial carbon capture applications.
Main
Following current trends in greenhouse gas emissions, the average temperature of the Earth’s
surface will inevitably warm by 1.5 °C, the global limit agreed to under the 2015 Paris Agreement8,
by as early as 20349. Due to this urgent situation, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from
fossil fuel-fired power plants and relative hard-to-abate sectors plays a key role during clean energy
transition to reach international climate targets. Although global CCS deployment has bloomed in
recent years to reach a capacity of ~50 Mt CO2 captured and stored annually10,11, this amount only
accounts for 0.6% of the value needed (>8 Gt) to achieve net zero CO2 emissions, consistent with
the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C limit, by 205012,13 (Fig. 1a). Clearly, this disparity requires a large
expansion of CCS deployment worldwide to meet the climate mitigation targets over the coming
decades.
Since their conception nearly a century ago14, aqueous amine scrubbers have emerged as the most
technology-ready system for CCS2. The first-generation technology using monoethanolamine
(MEA) and later advances using secondary/tertiary amines demonstrate high selectivity for CO2
via reversible ammonium carbamate formation under dry conditions and ammonium bicarbonate
(HCO3−) and/or carbonate (CO32−) formation under humid conditions (Fig. 1a)15. However, amines
suffer from several critical drawbacks that hinder their widespread deployment. First, high

regeneration temperatures (>100 °C) in temperature-swing processes are needed to reverse the
strong binding of CO2 (−ΔHabs > 12 kcal/mol)16, which accounts for 70–80%17,18 of the total energy
cost required to continuously operate a scrubber. Second, high operation temperatures and the
presence of oxygen combined with leached metal ions lead to significant thermal and oxidative
amine degradation into over 100 reported products, necessitating continuous replacement and
complex reclaiming processes3,18–22. The decomposition of amines, which is hard to avoid due to
their highly electron-rich, nucleophilic, and basic nature, adds an additional 10% to the overall
cost of carbon capture systems23. Last, amines are toxic, volatile, and corrosive, which presents
challenges regarding their safe handling on multi-ton scale4,5,24,25. As such, replacements for
amines that maintain their reactivity-based selectivity for CO2 while also demonstrating improved
stability and reduced energy use, corrosiveness, volatility, and toxicity, would greatly accelerate
the global adoption of CCS.
One type of reported oxidation products of tertiary amines are the corresponding trialkylamine Noxides6,7 (Fig. 1b). The formation of N-oxides would normally be considered a dead-end for carbon
capture due to the loss of the nucleophilic and basic nitrogen center. Nonetheless, N-oxides are
highly prevalent in both biological and industrial settings for a variety of applications, as they are
generally non-toxic and non-corrosive26–28. For example, trimethyl amine N-oxide (TMAO) is
found in deep-sea organisms as an osmolyte to prevent denaturation of vital proteins29,30. Smallmolecule N-oxides, specifically N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (MMNO), are used industrially in
the Lyocell process to dissolve cellulose31–34. Long-chain and polymeric N-oxides are used as
surfactants in cleansing products such as detergents and shampoos, and industrially as antifouling
reagents and kinetic hydrate inhibitors26,35,36.
Herein, we demonstrate that oxidation of trialkylamines to the corresponding trialkylamine Noxides does not preclude their use for carbon capture, as weakly basic MMNO is still capable of
binding CO2 under humid conditions via the formation of a hydrogen-bond-stabilized HCO3−
species (Fig. 1c). Unlike amines, MMNO exhibits good oxidative and thermal stability, is
minimally volatile37, and binds CO2 weakly enough to allow for facile release at room temperature
in a simulated vacuum swing process and ~ 65 °C in a simulated temperature swing process. Along
with their similar structural tunability to amines, these promising features suggest that
trialkylamine N-oxides such as MMNO may serve as industrially viable alternative for amines
with improved longevity and reduced operating costs.

Role of water in CO2 capture with MMNO

To probe whether MMNO is capable of reversibly binding CO2, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) experiments in wet deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-D6) were conducted at 25 °C
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The presence of MMNO induced significant broadening of the resonance
corresponding to dissolved CO2 (124–125 ppm, see Supplementary Fig. 5 for comparison with
non-broadened resonances); in addition, a new broad resonance (158–159 ppm) corresponding to
a carbonyl (C=O)-containing species was observed. The broad nature of the observed resonances
indicates that free CO2 and the new species are undergoing slow-intermediate exchange on the 13C
NMR time scale (kex < |Δν|)38. As such, experiments were conducted with 13CO2 in anhydrous
DMSO-D6 to better visualize the chemically bound 13CO2 adduct and to carefully control the
equivalents of H2O present in solution (Fig. 2a). With water or anhydrous MMNO alone, no new
species form upon dosing the solution with 13CO2. However, when an equimolar solution of H2O
and MMNO is dosed with 13CO2, a broad new resonance appears at 158–159 ppm, which is
assigned to a 13CO2 adduct of MMNO and H2O (MMNO•H2O•13CO2) containing a C=O group
(the same is observed for up to 20 equivalents of H2O, see Fig. 2a, 3a, and Supplementary Fig. 13).
The free 13CO2 resonance is also significantly broadened due to chemical exchange interactions
(Fig. 2a). Notably, bubbling N2 through the solution for 60 minutes at room temperature

(simulating a vacuum swing) leads to full desorption of chemically bound 13CO2, supporting that
the reaction between MMNO, H2O, and 13CO2 can be readily reversed (Fig. 2a). No degradation
or rearrangement of MMNO occurred under these conditions, as confirmed by 1H−13C 2D HMBC
spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 39). Notably, CO2 could also be released at ~65 ° C in a
simulated temperature swing process, reflecting the lower potential regeneration energy costs of
MMNO compared to amines (Supplementary Fig. 29).
It is clear that the presence of H2O is vital for MMNO to react with CO2. Unlike amines, N-oxides
are not strongly nucleophilic nor Brønsted basic (pKa of R3N+–OH = 4.5–5), yet they are highly
Lewis basic and one of the strongest neutral organic hydrogen-bond acceptors due to the polar
N→O bond (dipole moment ~5 D) and the formal negative charge on O26,39. To better understand
the role of H2O in the CO2 capture process, MMNO hydrate (MMNO•(H2O)n) formation was first
probed using the interaction-induced chemical shift perturbations of MMNO as the host and H2O
as the guest molecule in DMSO-D6. NMR titration experiments were performed with three
different MMNO concentrations (0.125 M, 0.25 M, and 0.5 M) with increasing equivalents of
water. At all three host concentrations, the 1H chemical shifts were perturbed as H2O was titrated
(Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs. 6, 8, and 10; see Equation 1 in Supplementary Information),
consistent with fast-exchange interactions between MMNO and its hydrates on the 1H NMR time
scale (kex >> |Δν|) 38. Among the nuclei monitored, Ha and Hd of MMNO experience the largest
perturbations, indicating that they participate in the interaction with H2O most closely. The NMR
titration experimental data were fit to five binding models corresponding to host:guest ratios of
1:1 (monohydrate) or 1:2 (dihydrate) using Bindfit with a global non-linear regression method40–
42
(see Supplementary Information for theory, and Supplementary Table 1 for model features). The
1:2 full model yielded the best covfit (see Supplementary Table 1 for details), indicating that the
binding of the second H2O molecule is made weaker by the binding of the first, with an interaction
parameter (α) of 0.2 (Equation 11 in Supplementary Information). Together, these NMR studies
support the association of H2O with MMNO to form both MMNO•H2O and MMNO•(H2O)2, with
the maximum relative molar ratio of MMNO•H2O reached at 5–10 equivalents of H2O added
relative to MMNO (Fig. 3b).
Intermolecular 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments were conducted
to further probe the nature of the interactions between H2O and MMNO (Fig. 2c–d and
Supplementary Figs. 20–21). With 1 equivalent of H2O in 0.25 M MMNO in DMSO-D6 at a long
mixing time of 600 ms, the NOESY spectrum shows several major cross-peaks resulting from the
close contact between the H2O proton (3.6 ppm) and the methyl Hc (3.0 ppm) and α (to N)equatorial Hd (2.7 ppm) protons of MMNO (Fig. 2c). This spectrum provides direct evidence for
the preferred H2O binding site (A) for MMNO•H2O, in which H2O hydrogen bonds to the oxygen
of MMNO in an orientation pointing away from the ring. In contrast, with 20 equivalents of H2O,
an additional intense cross-peak becomes visible. The new peak represents an interaction between
the H2O proton (3.7 ppm) and β (to N)-axial Ha (4.0 ppm), revealing the second binding pocket
(B) for water to hydrogen bond with MMNO in an orientation pointing towards the ring in

of MMNO hydrate and dihydrate formation can be recapitulated (Fig. 2e).

Mechanism of CO2 capture with MMNO•H2O

To interrogate the formation of MMNO•H2O•13CO2, NMR titration experiments with MMNO
(0.25 M in DMSO-D6) in the presence of 13CO2 were conducted (Fig. 3a). By integrating the
resonances corresponding to dissolved 13CO2 and MMNO•H2O•13CO2, the relative mole fractions
of both species as a function of H2O equivalents added could be determined (Fig. 3b). The mole
fraction of MMNO•H2O•13CO2 relative to dissolved 13CO2 maximizes at 2–10 equivalents of H2O
added relative to MMNO, which is a similar MMNO:H2O ratio at which the concentration of
MMNO•H2O maximizes in the absence of CO2 (highlighted with green in Fig. 3b). This finding
indicates that MMNO•H2O is likely responsible for CO2 capture under these conditions. Likewise,
dosing 13CO2 into solutions of MMNO in D2O (spanning from ~22 to ~222 equivalents of D2O)
yields a new resonance (~160 ppm) corresponding to a MMNO•13CO2 adduct, which was not
observed in D2O alone (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the relative integrations of free 13CO2 and this
adduct showed a negative correlation between the concentration of MMNO•13CO2 and the
D2O:MMNO ratio.
Although observing MMNO•H2O•13CO2 directly by 1H NMR is challenging due to the dynamic
fast-exchange nature of 13CO2 binding on the 1H NMR time scale (Supplementary Fig. 14), the
chemical shift observed for H2O further supports the formation of a 13CO2 adduct. For example, at
4 equivalents of H2O relative to MMNO in DMSO-D6 (see Supplementary Figs. 14–17 for other
equivalents), the exchange among free H2O, H2O•MMNO, and MMNO•(H2O)2 results in a shift
downfield from 3.4 ppm to 3.6 ppm due to strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between H2O
and MMNO (Fig. 3d). Markedly, in the presence of 13CO2, the resonance of H2O shifts to 3.9 ppm
and further broadens (Fig. 3d), which likely results from exchanging with a new species possessing
a much more downfield-shifted proton (i.e., MMNO•H2O•13CO2) on top of the exchange pathways
discussed above.
Based on the observations above, the most likely mechanistic scenario is that MMNO•H2O—and
not free MMNO—reacts with CO2 via carbonic acid (H2CO3, pKa(apparent) ~6)43,44, HCO3− (pKa
~10)43, or CO32− formation. The latter is unfavored because, unlike amines, MMNO is not basic
enough to deprotonate HCO3− to form CO32−. An alternative mechanistic pathway in which the
oxygen of the N-oxide directly attacks CO2 was ruled out based on 15N and 1H−13C 2D HMBC
spectroscopies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see Supplementary Figs. 42, 43,
and DFT discussions). To distinguish among these possibilities, 13C NMR experiments were
conducted to benchmark the chemical shift of the CO2 adduct formed with MMNO•H2O in D2O
against various HCO3− and CO32− salts (Fig. 3e). The experimental 13C NMR chemical shift of
MMNO•13CO2 in D2O (160 ppm) is closer to that observed for HCO3− (160.6–160.7 ppm) than for
CO32− (161.1–168.5 ppm) or that predicted for H2CO3 (152 ppm, see Supplementary Table 4 for
computational details). Furthermore, the pH was monitored when CO2 was bubbled through a 0.25
M aqueous MMNO solution and ultrapure water for comparison (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig.
41). In pure water, the pH drops and then stabilizes at 4.36, at which only dissolved CO2 and H2CO3
are present43,45. However, in the presence of MMNO, a steady state at pH 6.19 was observed,

corresponding to the apparent pK1 of 6.35 at which no CO32− is present in aqueous solutions43.
Together, these findings support that carbon capture with MMNO•H2O occurs via formation of a
HCO3− species stabilized by hydrogen bonding with MMNO.

DFT calculations were next performed with Gaussian 1646 at the ωB97XD47 level of theory at
298.15 K in DMSO as the solvent to support the proposed pathway (Fig. 3g). Optimized structures
of MMNO•H2O(A) and MMNO•(H2O)2 were found to have H2O bound in preferred orientations
that match well with the NOESY experiments (Fig. 3g and Fig. 2c–d; see Supplementary
Information for the less favored MMNO•H2O(B)). Three possible and energetically similar
adducts (1–3) based on different conformations48–51 of MMNO–H+···HCO3− or MMNO···H2CO3
can be envisioned (Fig. 3g). For structures 2 and 3, the O···O distances (2.45 Å for 2, 2.44 Å for
3) for the most important hydrogen bond interactions (O–H+···O−) are much shorter than in 1 (2.55
Å and 2.58 Å), within the range of strong hydrogen-bonding interactions (2.2–2.5 Å)52. Further,
C–H···O interactions are also predicted in optimized structures 2 and 3. The 13C chemical shifts
corresponding to the C=O carbons in 1–3 were also predicted using the gauge-independent atomic
orbitals method53,54 at the same level of theory in DMSO (see Supplementary Table 4 for chemical
shift calculations in H2O). The calculated chemical shift (155 ppm) of 3 agrees best with the
experimental chemical shift (159 ppm) of MMNO•H2O•13CO2 in DMSO-D6, making 3 the most
plausible structure for this adduct. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of this reaction, we
cannot rule out involvement of other species. Further, our calculations also support that
MMNO•H2O reacting with CO2 is favored by ΔΔH = 2.34–2.98 kcal/mol compared to
MMNO•(H2O)2 formation, supporting that CO2 capture is still favored even in the presence of
excess H2O. The calculated CO2 binding enthalpy for 3 relative to MMNO•H2O is only −9.53
kcal/mol, which is significantly less downhill than that normally observed for amines (<−12
kcal/mol)16. This finding explains why MMNO•H2O•CO2 can release CO2 easily (~65 °C under
pure CO2 atmosphere), whereas most amines must be heated above 100 °C to be regenerated in a
temperature swing process.

The studies outlined above support that MMNO•H2O can reversibly react with CO2 to form
MMNO–H+···HCO3− (3), representing a new pathway for CO2 absorption. To validate that this
mechanism enables carbon capture under realistic conditions, the cyclability of CO2 binding were
evaluated using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Owing to its reasonable saturation time and ease of
preparation, a 1:4 (v:v) mixture of commercially available 50 wt. % (~6.5 equivalents of water)
aqueous MMNO solution and DMSO was employed for these measurements (both components
used directly as received). Upon bubbling CO2 (6 sccm, see Supplementary Note 2), two new
characteristic C=O stretches at 1656 cm−1 and 1716 cm−1 were found to increase in intensity over
time (Fig. 4a), which can be attributed to the formation of MMNO–H+···HCO3−. Indeed, DFTcalculated vibrational frequencies of proposed products 2 and 3 reveal a similar two-peak profile
in the range of 1550–1800 cm−1 (see Supplementary Figs. 47–48 and Supplementary Note 4).
Upon purging the solution with N2, these signals disappear, consistent with the reversibility of CO2
binding observed by 13C NMR (Fig. 2a). Emulating a vacuum-swing process, pure CO2 was
bubbled through the MMNO solution (6 sccm) for 1 hour, followed by pure N2 (6 sccm) for 1 hour.
Good reversibility was observed over seven cycles, with the last four cycles showing nearly
identical profiles (Fig. 4b, see Supplementary Fig. 23 for the first three cycles before stabilizing).
Absorption and desorption were largely completed in less than 30 minutes; in addition, viscosity
measurements revealed that this solution retained low viscosities both before and after CO2 dosing
(Supplementary Fig. 40). Gravimetric CO2 capacities were also measured by weighing solutions
before and after 1 hour of absorption, corrected by solvent controls under the same conditions (see
Supplementary Information for details, Supplementary Table 2, 3 for data). We determined that
the MMNO solution reaches a capacity of 2.32 mmol CO2/g MMNO under a pure CO2 stream in
1 hour (Fig. 4c).
To evaluate whether MMNO•H2O can remove CO2 from dilute, mixed gas streams, 50% and 15%
CO2 mixtures in N2 were flowed through the same MMNO solution (Fig. 4c). Good capacities
(1.48 and 0.92 mmol CO2/g MMNO, respectively) were still observed by IR and gravimetric
measurements after 1 hour under these conditions. However, real flue gas streams contain
contaminants other than N2, including O2, H2O, NOx, and SOx, that can lead to sorbent degradation3.
A sample of flue gas from the Cornell Combined Heat and Power (CHP) natural gas-fired power
plant—consisting of 9.7% CO2, 3.8% O2, 43 ppm NOx, remainder H2O and N2—was obtained to
test the CO2 capture capability of MMNO•H2O from an industrial waste stream. Remarkably, we
determined that MMNO•H2O can capture CO2 from this flue gas to reach a capacity of 0.70 mmol
CO2/g MMNO after 1 hour, with no additional stretches observed due to sorbent degradation by
IR (Supplementary Fig. 28).
One of the major limitations of amine-based scrubbers is their poor long-term cycling stability
arising from oxidative and thermal degradation3,19. Indeed, heating the amines 4-methyl

morpholine (MM) and 1-methylpiperazine (MP), two close structural analogs of MMNO, and
monoethanolamine (MEA), a benchmark amine for carbon capture, in D2O for 1 week at 100 °C
under flue gas led to the formation of insoluble impurities (Fig. 5d). More degradation was
observed for MM, MP, and MEA in wet DMSO-D6 after the same accelerated aging studies: the
solutions became darkly colored, and numerous new species were observed by 1H NMR
(Supplementary Figs. 36–38). In contrast, MMNO exhibits excellent stability after being heated in
both D2O and wet DMSO-D6 at 100 °C under flue gas (Fig. 5d). No degradation was observed in
D2O (Supplementary Fig. 34), and the only degradation product observed upon extended heating
in DMSO-D6 under flue gas was MM, likely due to slow O atom transfer from MMNO to the
solvent (Supplementary Fig. 35). Notably, MM can be easily reoxidized to MMNO with hydrogen
peroxide in the presence of CO2 as the catalyst26,56, offering a potential method for sorbent
regeneration after extended cycling.

Given the immediacy of the looming climate crisis, we urgently need new sorbents that can be
rapidly scaled and employed in engineering configurations that have already been optimized for
amine-based scrubbers. The presented gas sorption, spectroscopic, and computational studies
support that the monohydrates of tertiary amine N-oxides, one of the oxidative byproducts arising
from CO2 capture with tertiary amines6,7, can capture CO2 via a new hydrogen-bonding pathway.
The inexpensive MMNO is robust towards oxygen and high temperatures while exhibiting good
CO2 uptake from dilute streams, including flue gas from a natural gas-fired power plant. Given the
relatively low heat of absorption of this system, it could also offer opportunities for high-feedpressure systems. Our findings lay the groundwork for the further development of small-molecule
and polymeric tertiary amine N-oxides as non-basic sorbents for challenging CO2 separations.

CO2 dosing with controlled water amount

In a N2-filled glovebox, MMNO (dried by vacuum sublimation) and DMSO-D6 (dried over
molecular sieves) were added to a screw-cap NMR tube (dried at 165 °C for 12 hours). The tube
was then sealed and brought out of glovebox. Alternatively, D2O (instead of DMSO-D6) or DI
water was added quickly outside the glovebox. Subsequently, the sample was dosed with 13CO2
(99 atom % 13C, <3 atom % 18O) on the custom-built setup after degassing (cooling to −78 °C for
DMSO-D6 or 0 °C for D2O).
NMR Chemical Shift Perturbation Titration
DI water (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 equiv. for 0.125 M; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 equiv. for 0.2 M;
0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5, 10 equiv. for 0.5 M) was added quickly to the NMR tube with (13CO2
dosed) MMNO solutions in DMSO-D6. The mixture obtained at each titration point was shaken
thoroughly for 1 min and allowed to equilibrate in the NMR probe for 5 min before the spectra
were recorded. All NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C. The data were fitted to the built-in
mathematical models in Bindfit40.
NMR spectroscopy
1

H, 13C, 1H−1H NOESY, 1H−15N HMBC NMR spectra were all recorded on Bruker or Varian 500
MHz spectrometers, 1H−13C HMBC was recorded on a Varian 600 MHz spectrometer. In the cases
of DMSO-D6, spectra were referenced to 2.50 ppm for 1H NMR and 39.52 ppm for 13C NMR. In
the cases of D2O, spectra were referenced to 4.79 ppm for 1H NMR, and 77.16 ppm (for CDCl3
inserts) or using the absolute reference function in Mestrenova for 13C NMR.
IR measurements

Infrared spectra were recorded with ReactIRTM iC10 FTIR spectrometer fitted with a 30-bounce,
silicon-tipped probe. 100%, 50%, and 15% CO2 (in N2), flue gas (from Cornell Combined Heat
and Power Plant, 9.7% CO2, 3.8% O2, 43 ppm NOx, remainder H2O and N2), and 100% N2 were
dosed through the custom-built setups at 6 sccm or 6 mL/min. During a regular carbon capture
cycle, CO2-containing streams were bubbled through a 5 mL 1:4 (v:v) 50 wt. %
MMNO(aq):DMSO solution (used as received) for 1 hour, then the streams were switched to 100%
N2 for 1 hour to simulate vacuum swing processes for desorption. The cycling experiments were
all done at room temperature (21–22 °C).
Gravimetric measurements
Empty vials with septa caps were tared, and then 50 wt. % MMNO (aq) and DMSO (used as
received) were added to make total of 5 mL solutions. For control experiments, the same amounts
of DI water and DMSO were added instead. The total masses were recorded, and then a 100%, 50%
or 15% CO2 in N2 mixture was bubbled through the mixtures for 1 hour. After bubbling, the masses
were recorded again. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The measurements were done
at room temperature (21–22 °C).
Viscosity measurements

Viscosities of 22 mL 1:4 (v:v) 50 wt. % MMNO(aq):DMSO solution before and after 100% CO2
dosing (1.5 h, room temperature) were measured on Discovery Hybrid Rheometer HR-3 (TA
Instruments) equipped with Peltier Concentric Cylinder system using a geometry of DIN conical
rotor and standard cup. Viscosities were measured at a shear rate of 300 s−1 at 25, 45, 65, and 85 °C.

pH measurements
pH measurements were conducted with a HI 221 Calibration Check Microprocessor pH Meter. A
3-point calibration (with pH 4, pH 7, and pH 10 buffers) was performed before the measurement.
Measurements were performed on both ultrapure water and 0.25 M MMNO in DI water (both 6
mL). pH readings on the pH meter were recorded every 10 s.
DFT calculations
All DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 16 package46 at the ωB97XD47 level of
theory at 298.15 K. A pruned (99, 590) integration grid (equivalent to Gaussian’s “UltraFine”
option) was used for all calculations. The self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) was used to model
systems in DMSO as the solvent by using SMD (solvation model density) solvation model57. All
geometries were optimized with the def2-SVP basis set58,59. A vibrational frequency analysis was
conducted at the same level of theory as the geometry optimizations (ωB97XD/def2-SVP). The
optimized geometries characterized as local minima on the potential energy surfaces (PES) have
no imaginary frequencies. For improved accuracy single point energies were calculated with the
same dispersion corrected ωB97XD functional using the slightly larger (def2-TZVP) basis set58,59
of the same family. 13C NMR chemical shifts of C=O carbons in structures 1, 2, and 3 in both
water and DMSO were predicted by using DFT at their optimized geometries by employing GIAO
(gauge-independent atomic orbitals) method53,54, with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the reference (0
ppm) calculated at the same level of theory. The isotropic magnetic shielding tensors were
averaged over all symmetric carbons when applicable.
