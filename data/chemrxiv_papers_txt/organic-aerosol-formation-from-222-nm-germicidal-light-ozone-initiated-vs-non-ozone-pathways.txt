Germicidal ultraviolet lamps outputting 222 nm light (GUV222) have the potential to reduce the
airborne spread of disease through effective inactivation of pathogens, while remaining safe for
direct human exposure. However, recent studies have identified these lamps as a source of ozone
and other secondary pollutants such as secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and the health effects
of these pollutants must be balanced against the benefits of pathogen inactivation. While ozone
reactions are likely to account for much of this secondary indoor air pollution, 222 nm light may
initiate additional non-ozone chemical processes, including the formation of other oxidants and
direct photolytic reactions, which are not as well understood. This work examines the impacts of
GUV222 light on SOA formation and composition by comparing limonene oxidation under
GUV222 and O3-only control conditions in a laboratory chamber. Differences between these
experiments enable us to distinguish patterns in aerosol formation driven by ozone chemistry
from those driven by other photolytic processes. These experiments also examine the influence
of the addition of NO2 and nitrous acid (HONO), and investigate SOA formation in sampled
outdoor air. SOA composition and yield vary only slightly with respect to GUV222 vs ozone-only
conditions; NO2 and HONO photolysis do not appreciably affect the observed chemistry. In
contrast, we observe consistent new particle formation under high-fluence 222 nm light (45 µW
cm-2) that differs dramatically from ozone-only experiments. This observed new particle
formation represents an additional reason to keep GUV222 fluence rates to the lowest effective
levels.

Germicidal ultraviolet lamps that emit light at 222 nm (GUV222) can be a useful tool for reducing
the airborne spread of disease in indoor environments, but might also negatively impact indoor
air quality through the formation of ozone and particulate matter. This work demonstrates that
GUV222 lamps not only drive increases in total particulate mass due to reactions of ozone with
organic species, but also increase new particle formation in excess of what is caused by such
reactions. The formation of ultrafine aerosol particles represents a potential health hazard in the
indoor environment, and GUV222 applications should therefore keep fluence rates to the
minimum effective levels to reduce negative impacts to indoor air quality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased interest in germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light as
a potential strategy for reducing the airborne spread of disease. Traditional applications of GUV
light have used 254 nm mercury lamps, which effectively inactivate airborne pathogens, but pose
a threat to human health if shined directly on skin and eyes. Newly available filtered KrCl
excimer lamps, which emit light at 222 nm, have been reported to efficiently inactivate
pathogens while still being safe for direct human exposure.1,2 Due to its shorter wavelength, the
light does not penetrate the top layer of the skin or ocular tear layer, minimizing concerns about
human ultraviolet light exposure.3,4

However, recent work has raised concerns about the effects of 222 nm light (GUV222) on
indoor air quality,5–11 in large part due to the production of ozone, a well-known human health
hazard.12,13 Ozone production from GUV222, proceeding through the photolysis of O2 followed
by the reaction of the resulting O atoms with O2 to form O3, is now well documented through
both modeling calculations and laboratory experiments.5–8 Under laboratory conditions, GUV222
irradiation can lead to high (> 100 ppb) O3 levels, but in real indoor spaces, O3 increases are
generally much lower (~6.5 ppb increase observed in an office,7 ~5 ppb increase in a restroom11)
due to the loss of ozone to indoor surfaces and relatively low average GUV222 fluence rates.
These modest increases represent a potential source of concern given that the integrated exposure
to indoor ozone is magnified by the amount of time people spend indoors;14 associated increases
in oxidized volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) compound this potential hazard.11,15

While some prior studies have primarily focused on quantifying ozone production from
GUV222,5,7 222 nm light has the potential to drive chemistry beyond O2 photolysis. As
demonstrated in previous work,6,8,9 GUV222 can form the hydroxyl radical (OH), both through
ozone photolysis and through the reaction of ozone with alkenes. Ozone and OH both react with
volatile organic compounds, resulting in the production of OVOCs and secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) particles.8,9,11 Previous work has also identified GUV222-driven new particle
formation under some conditions,8,11,16 which could act as a source of ultrafine particles in the
indoor environment. Finally, a recent field study has characterized SOA formation and growth in
the presence of GUV222 in a typical indoor space,11 demonstrating that these products of
secondary chemistry, particularly SOA, can be formed under real-world conditions.

While this previous work has examined the formation of secondary pollutants other than
ozone, the extent to which photochemical processes that do not directly involve ozone (referred
to here as “non-ozone chemistry”) affect secondary chemistry and aerosol formation is unclear.
Previous work8,9,11 demonstrates that SOA forms in the presence of GUV222, but less is known
about the effects of GUV222 light on SOA yield and composition, relative to SOA formed solely
from reactions with ozone. Further, new particle formation sometimes observed under 222 nm
light is not understood. In addition, in our previous work,8 we suggested that the photolysis of
other species, such as NO2, HONO, and photolabile organic molecules, may affect OH
concentrations or radical cycling, but to our knowledge, such photolytic processes have not yet
been explored.

The present work seeks to better understand non-ozone chemistry stemming from
GUV222 irradiation, specifically focusing on secondary organic aerosol formation, and the
potential role of trace species that can be present in indoor air. Experiments compare aerosol
formation under 222 nm light and O3-only control conditions to identify differences driven by
photolysis; these may be direct, for example by photolysis of an organic species, or indirect, for
example from chemistry initiated by photolytically-formed OH. Using limonene as a model
compound, chosen because of its common use in household cleaning products and propensity to
generate SOA,17 we perform a series of experiments in two environmental chambers to identify
differences in aerosol yield, composition, and tendency to form new particles. While this study
does not seek to directly mimic indoor conditions (e.g., we do not include reactive surfaces), we
also investigate more complex indoor mixtures by examining the influence of NOX and HONO,
often present in moderate concentrations in indoor spaces,18,19 on GUV222-derived aerosol
production, and by performing experiments in which clean laboratory air is replaced by ambient
outdoor air. This work focuses on the chemical processes stemming from 222 nm irradiation, and
as such uses higher GUV222 fluence rates and VOC concentrations than are typically found in
indoor environments, in order to enhance the distinctions between 222 nm and O3-only
chemistry.

Experiments are carried out in two differently-sized Teflon chambers, described
previously.8,20,21 The first (7.5 m3 in volume, referred to as the “large chamber”) is characterized
by a relatively low particle wall loss rate and low GUV222 fluence rate, and is primarily used to
quantify aerosol yield. The second one (0.15 m3 volume, referred to as the “mini chamber”) is
used to study aerosol composition and size distribution trends due to its shorter residence time
that more easily enables replicates. Both chambers are operated in “semi-batch mode,” in which
clean air is continuously introduced to maintain slight positive pressure and make up for air
removed through sampling.

All experiments compare the effects of GUV222 with ozone-only conditions by matching
ozone concentrations in the chamber for each experiment. For “GUV222” experiments, ozone is
produced by the GUV222 lamp (Ushio, Care222 B1 Illuminator, peak emission at 222 nm).
Average GUV222 fluence rate is estimated to be 45 µW cm-2 for the mini chamber8 and 3.9 µW
cm-2 for the large chamber (see SI). For “ozone-only” experiments, the lamp is kept off and
ozone is produced using an ozone generator (Jelight Model 610); ozone generation is tuned to
match production by the GUV222 lamp by adjusting the lamp sleeve and reducing the power
delivered using a Variac. Experiments are alternated between GUV222 and ozone-only conditions
to avoid systematic biases in chamber conditions.

Materials and methods are broadly the same for both large (n = 7) and small chamber
experiments (n = 33). Clean air used for flushing and dilution for limonene oxidation
experiments was produced by a zero-air generator (AADCO Model 737) (expts. 1 – 13) or
supplied from an ultra zero air tank (Linde) (expts. 15 – 32). Relative humidity for dry (<1%
RH) or humid (27 – 45% RH) experiments is adjusted by bubbling an additional flow of clean air
through Milli-Q water. Most experiments use (R)-(+)-limonene (C10H16, Sigma Aldrich) as a

precursor VOC, ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4, Sigma Aldrich) for aerosol seed particles, and
hexafluorobenzene (C6F6, Sigma Aldrich) as a dilution tracer. Specific details for each
experiment are provided in Tables S1 and S2, and more detailed experimental methods are

Mini chamber experiments are carried out in two sets, separated by approximately 5
months; we refer to the earlier and later sets by the year they were carried out (2023 or 2024).
For each mini chamber experiment, total dilution flows are maintained at 10.5 LPM, resulting in
a measured dilution rate of 2.7 air changes per hour (ACH) (2023 experiments) or 3.2 ACH
(2024 experiments) (these differ due to a small leak in the bubbler used in the 2023 experiments).
Ozone is first allowed to reach a steady-state concentration (for NOX-free experiments: 106 ± 6
ppb (1σ)) by turning on the ozone generator or the GUV222 lamp, mounted above the chamber as
in Barber et al.8 Once steady-state ozone is reached, a solution of ammonium sulfate (2 g/L) is
atomized into the chamber using an aerosol generator (TSI model 3076). This is followed by the
addition of hexafluorobenzene (0.05 µL, 70 ppb), and subsequently limonene (0.1 µL, 100 ppb),
initiating the experiment. This timepoint is considered t = 0. For six mini chamber experiments
(expts. 27 – 32), an additional flow of NO is added resulting in a steady-state NOX concentration
of 18.2 ± 0.7 ppb (1σ). For another six mini chamber experiments (expts. 35 – 40), outdoor air is
used instead of clean air, and is continuously pumped through a stainless steel 0.5 µm filter into
the chamber; no VOC, dilution tracer, or aerosol seed are added.

For large chamber experiments, total dilution flows are maintained at 20 LPM; measured
dilution rate is ~0.16 ACH. The GUV222 light is mounted outside the chamber, at the center of
one of the square sides. For each experiment, ammonium sulfate (2 g/L) is first atomized into the
chamber for 9 minutes. After approximately 30 min, hexafluorobenzene (2.2 µL, 61 ppb) and
limonene (6.0 µL, 119 ppb) are sequentially added to the chamber through a coated stainlesssteel inlet heated to 50 and 120 °C respectively. The decays of these species are monitored for >
1 hr before the start of the experiment. The experiment is initiated by turning on the GUV222
lamp or the ozone generator (considered t = 0). One large chamber experiment (expt. 7) uses a
steady flow of HONO, resulting in a HONO concentration that ranges from 9 to 18 ppb over the
course of the experiment (See SI for more details).
Particle-phase data are collected using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, TSI) and
an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS, Aerodyne Research, Inc.22). For large chamber
experiments, AMS data are corrected for dilution and wall losses by normalizing to the
ammonium sulfate concentration, and scaled such that initial aerosol seed concentration matches
that measured by the SMPS (see SI). Time-dependent aerosol yield is calculated as the mass
concentration of organic aerosol divided by the mass concentration of limonene reacted. For mini
chamber experiments, AMS data are used primarily for elemental composition analysis;23 aerosol
yields are not calculated due to the uncertainties caused by relatively high particle wall loss rates.
New particle formation in limonene mini chamber experiments is quantified by fitting the
number-weighted particle size distribution to a linear combination of lognormal distributions at
each timestep. For experiments in which no new particle formation occurs, the data are wellrepresented by a single curve; for experiments in which new particle formation occurs, a second

mode at smaller particle diameters forms. Where two (or in one case, three) modes are evident,
the total particle number associated with the nucleation mode(s) is calculated based on the
integral of the lognormal fit; the maximum of this value is considered to be the maximum total
new particle formation for purposes of comparing nucleation between experiments. See the SI
for further description of this analysis.

Gas-phase species are monitored using an additional set of online instrumentation. Ozone
concentration is monitored using an ozone monitor (2BTech). Limonene and hexafluorobenzene
concentrations are monitored using a gas chromatograph with flame ionization detection (GCFID, SRI Instruments). For small chamber experiments, the GC-FID is started precisely at t = 4
min to ensure reproducibility between experiments, since measurements are taken only every 12
minutes. For large chamber experiments, limonene concentration is corrected for dilution based
on the hexafluorobenzene time series to facilitate the calculation of aerosol yields. In some
experiments (see Table S1), trace gas measurements are supplemented with a chemiluminescence
NO−NO2−NOX analyzer (NOX analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a cavity attenuated phase
shift NO2 monitor (CAPS NO2, Aerodyne Research, Inc.). The combination of these two
instruments allows for quantification of NO, NO2, and HONO (via subtraction of the CAPS NO2
signal from the NOX analyzer measurement, see SI). For two sets of experiments, an ammonium
chemical ionization mass spectrometer (NH4+ CIMS; modified PTR324) provides measurements
of oxidized gas-phase organic species. While the instrument signal is unstable and uncalibrated
during these experiments, it nonetheless provides qualitative insights into gas-phase products.
Further instrument details and more complete description of data analysis methods are provided

Mini chamber experiments involving limonene oxidation consistently exhibit new
particle formation under GUV222 irradiation; this is substantially greater than in the ozone-only
experiments, often by a large margin. Figure 1A shows results from two consecutive minichamber limonene experiments, one with GUV222 (expt. 23) and the other with O3 addition (expt.
22). Despite the fact that both have very similar ozone and limonene time series (top panels), far
more new particle formation is observed the GUV222 case. In the presence of GUV222, new
particle formation occurs almost immediately after t = 0, with total particle number concentration
growing to 6 × 104 cm-3. In contrast, the ozone-only experiment exhibits size distribution
characteristics of SOA growth on the seed aerosol, with a much smaller nucleation mode.

Such differences in new particle formation occur under every chemical condition tested
in the mini chamber (see Fig. S4 – S5). Figure 1B shows the maximum nucleated particle
concentration for each experiment, allowing comparison of new particle formation for GUV222
vs. ozone-only conditions across different humidity and NOX levels. The most nucleation occurs
under dry conditions, whereas the least occurs in the presence of NOX. This is consistent with the
total SOA mass concentrations in mini chamber experiments; SOA mass is generally higher
under dry conditions, and lower in the presence of ~20 ppb NO (see SI), suggesting that this
trend may simply be controlled here by differences in SOA yield. While the maximum nucleated
particle count varies dramatically between chamber conditions, it is always substantially greater
under GUV222 conditions than in comparable ozone-only experiments.

We performed an additional set of experiments (expts. 35 – 40) on a more complex
system by filling the mini chamber with ambient air sampled continuously from outside our
building. As shown in Fig. 2, new particles are formed every time the GUV222 lamp is turned on,

while new particle formation under ozone-only conditions is almost negligible. Particles formed
in the presence of GUV222 light reach number concentrations as high as 3.5 × 104 particles cm-3,
before the total particle number concentration drops due to coagulation. As the first nucleated
mode continues to grow, a second smaller nucleation event occurs, leading to a relatively steady
total particle number concentration after about one hour. In contrast, the interspersed ozone-only
experiments demonstrate little obvious nucleation (max. 16 – 1100 particles cm-3). Under
GUV222 conditions, particles grow to sufficient size to be detected as organic aerosol in the AMS
(See Fig. S6). While reaction conditions in these experiments are not identical—for example,
NOX concentrations (top panels) change somewhat due to fluctuations in ambient
concentrations—this cannot explain the substantial differences in new particle formation
between the GUV222 and O3-only experiments.

In addition to the chamber experiments with limonene or outdoor air, several blank mini
chamber experiments are run in which no VOCs (limonene or ambient species) are added to the
chamber (expt. 14, 33, 34) (See Fig. S7). As in prior work,8 new particle formation occurs under

222 nm light when the mini chamber is thoroughly flushed with air from our clean air generator
(2023 experiments). However, after the compressor for the clean air generator was replaced, such
nucleation under GUV222 irradiation is not observed. Further, nucleation does not occur during
blank experiments run with ultra zero air from a cylinder. Thus it seems likely that oxidation of
trace VOCs from the older compressor causes the new particle formation in earlier blank
experiments. The older compressor is used only for experiments 1 – 14 and does not influence
the interpretation of the results presented here (since GUV222 and ozone-only experiments are
always run under identical conditions for each experiment set). Experiments 8 – 13 (mini
chamber limonene oxidation) are replicated with ultra zero air (expts. 21 – 26); while these
experiments differ slightly due to faster particle wall loss and lower seed particle concentration,
they produce the same qualitative results (See Fig. S5).

In marked contrast to mini chamber results, substantial new particle formation never
occurs in large chamber experiments (See Fig. S10 – S11). This is despite higher limonene
concentrations (and similar seed concentrations), which would be expected to slightly increase
new particle formation. However, a very small (< ~200 particles cm-3) nucleation mode with
particles of diameter < 20 nm that do not grow in diameter forms consistently in both GUV222
and ozone-only experiments when limonene is present (see Section S.5. in the supplement).
Based on the similarity of this mode between GUV222 and ozone-only experiments, its formation
is likely an ozone-driven process.

255
256
257
258
259
260
261

The lack of substantial new particle formation in large chamber experiments may be
related to the reduced GUV222 fluence rate (< 10% of that in the mini chamber). Similar to these
experiments, no nucleation was observed in the mini chamber in our previous work when the
GUV222 lamp was attenuated by a factor of ~5.8 These results suggest that new particle formation
may be nonlinear with respect to GUV222 fluence rate, and imply that 222 nm fluence rates used
in indoor spaces, often a factor of ten or more lower than that used in the mini chamber, likely
will not drive the degree of new particle formation that was observed in this work.

262

Aerosol yield and composition

263
264
265

Given the differences in new particle formation, an additional set of limonene chamber
experiments were carried out to examine potential differences in aerosol yield and composition
between GUV222 and ozone-only conditions. These were first investigated in five experiments in
the large chamber (expt. 3 – 7), since its lower surface-to-volume ratio enables better
quantification of aerosol formation. Figure 3A shows aerosol yield as a function of reaction time.
Aerosol yields under GUV222 and ozone-only conditions are nearly identical, with the two
GUV222 experiments featuring slightly lower yield by the end of the experiment. This slight
difference agrees with the subtle decrease in SOA formation rate in the presence of GUV222
observed by Jenks et al.,9 and could be due to photolysis of SOA components, but may instead
simply be due to experimental variability. Relative humidity appears to play a far greater role,
with dry conditions increasing calculated yield by a factor as high as ~1.5. The measured aerosol
yields fall within the large range of literature values for limonene oxidation (26 – 109%),25–28 but
trends in yield with respect to RH are different those reported previously where yield was found
to stay the same or even increase with increased humidity.9,27,29 When 9 – 18 ppb HONO is

added to one experiment, aerosol yield is not appreciably different from the yield measured
under standard GUV222 conditions. While the causes for discrepancies between our
measurements and previous measurements are unclear, these results clearly demonstrate that the
differences in the GUV222 vs ozone-only experiments are small compared to other factors
controlling the amount of SOA formed.

Aerosol yields from the mini chamber experiments are not calculated given the large
uncertainties arising from rapid wall loss. As in the large chamber experiments, uncorrected
organic aerosol mass is higher under dry conditions when compared to directly comparable
humid experiments. When NOX is continuously added (with a steady-state level of ~18 ppb),
organic aerosol mass is substantially depressed, but this does not differ between GUV222 and
ozone-only conditions (See Fig. S13).

the greatest AMS organic signal (expt. 8 – 13) (results from all mini chamber experiments are
shown in Fig. S14). Points in Van Krevelen space are shown for timepoints after the elemental
composition has stabilized. All points fall within a relatively small range, but GUV222-derived
aerosol features consistently lower O/C and H/C ratios than ozone-only experiments. While this
effect is less clear for the large chamber experiments, the difference between GUV222 and ozoneonly O/C ratios in the mini chamber is statistically significant for the set of mini chamber
experiments shown (p = 0.002), likely due to the higher GUV222 fluence rates. These differences
are also observed in other sets of mini chamber experiments (Fig. S14), but the difference is not
quite as clear, likely due to the lower AMS aerosol signal and poorer AMS peak-shape tuning.
While differences between GUV222 and ozone-only elemental ratios are reproducible, they are
small in magnitude, and similar in magnitude to the differences induced by using different
chambers or different experimental conditions.

322

Chamber experiments examining the oxidation of limonene under GUV222 and ozoneonly conditions demonstrate relatively little difference in SOA yield and composition. The
differences observed between GUV222 and ozone-only experiments, while reproducible, are often
similar or smaller in magnitude to the magnitude of differences induced by changes in other
experimental parameters (e.g., NOX, RH, chamber type). This leads us to conclude that most of
the observed chemistry is driven by reactions with O3, in agreement with findings by Jenks et al.9
However, one major difference is new particle formation, which is consistently much greater in
the presence of high-fluence rate 222 nm light in the mini chamber.

New particle formation from the oxidation of organic species is likely to proceed through
the formation of low volatility organic compounds. These may include high-mass species such as
highly oxidized molecules (HOMs)30 or larger compounds with a large number of carbon atoms.
However, NH4+ CIMS measurements (which were taken for only two sets of experiments; see
SI) show no clear differences in any high mass ions between GUV222 and O3-only conditions.
Likewise, the AMS provides no evidence of dramatically differing chemical composition of the
organic aerosol, with aerosol produced under GUV222 conditions actually appearing to be slightly
less oxidized (Figure 3), suggesting that HOM formation is not responsible for differences in
nucleation. It is possible that even without the formation of HOMs, direct photoionization of
organic molecules could influence nucleation,31 but the energy of 222 nm photons at 222 nm (5.6
eV) is well below the threshold of ~8 eV for the most easily ionizable organic molecules. This
process would therefore require photons with wavelengths substantially shorter than 222 nm,
likely minimal based on published spectra,3 and ionization due to the simultaneous absorption of
two photons is highly unlikely given the low photon fluxes.

Other plausible causes for the differences in new particle formation include subtle
differences in reaction conditions. Nucleation may be strongly dependent on initial chamber
conditions, but these experiments do not feature systematic differences in ozone, seed particle, or
limonene concentration (see Figures S2 – S4). The photolysis of ozone by GUV222 has been
identified as an additional source of OH in previous studies,6,8 which could potentially impact
new particle formation. However, mechanistic modeling using the Master Chemical

Mechanism32 run in F0AM,33 suggests only modest increases in mean OH under GUV222
conditions compared to ozone-only conditions (1.7 × 106 vs 1.4 × 106 molec cm-3) (see SI).
Modeled OH concentrations are also almost identical in the first few minutes of the experiment
when nucleation occurs, suggesting that this difference is unlikely to explain new particle
formation. This is further supported by AMS measurements: literature chamber studies suggest
that aerosol from the OH oxidation of monoterpenes features a substantially higher H/C ratio
than aerosol from ozonolysis,34,35 but our measurements consistently show a slightly lower H/C
ratio under GUV222, suggesting that OH oxidation is unlikely to be the primary driver of aerosol
formation. Differences could also be explained by changes in radical chemistry due to the
photolysis of trace NOY species. However, the addition of NOX in expts. 27 – 32 suppresses
nucleation relative to experiments with no added NOX (Fig. 1); similarly, the addition of HONO
to a large chamber experiment does not impact nucleation or aerosol yield (Fig. 3). This is
contrary to our earlier speculation that NOY photolysis at 222 nm may have a major impact on
oxidant formation and secondary pollutant formation.8 The lack of any observed effect is likely a
result of the relatively low photon flux of the GUV222 lights, which leads to photolysis rates that
are substantially slower than dilution (jNO2 = 2.0 × 10-5 s-1 in the mini chamber; jHONO = 9.2 × 10-6
s-1 in the large chamber; see the Supporting Information). Finally, differences in other trace
species such as HO2 or RO2 could also influence oxidation chemistry, but box modeling suggests
that concentrations of these do not differ appreciably (see SI).

373
374
375

While our measurements do not pinpoint a mechanistic cause of increased new particle
formation under GUV222 conditions, they clearly identify several patterns. First, indirect or direct
photolytic processes are involved, since all variables except for light are held constant. Second,
new particle formation likely involves gas-phase organic compounds, since it only occurs when
VOCs are present (limonene, trace organics from clean air compressor, sampled ambient air).
The process is unlikely to involve organic species from chamber surfaces, since no nucleation is
observed in an ultra zero air blank experiment. The concentrations of such organic precursors
may be so low that they may be difficult to detect. For example, assuming the nucleated particles
(diameter < 20 nm) are organic, with O/C = 0.25, H/C = 2, and density = 1 g cm-3, even at their
highest observed volume concentrations they would account for no more than 0.2 ppb C.
Detection and characterization of such precursors might be possible via analytical techniques
aimed at detection of low-volatility species, such as nitrate chemical ionization mass
spectrometry36 to measure HOMs, or atmospheric pressure interface mass spectrometry,37 to
detect ambient ions and charged clusters.

376

Conclusion

377
378
379

This series of laboratory experiments demonstrates that most aspects of SOA formation
(e.g., yield, elemental composition, dependence on RH and NOX) in the presence of GUV222 are
consistent with ozonolysis chemistry. While some measured parameters such as the aerosol O/C
ratio vary reproducibly with respect to GUV222 vs ozone-only conditions, the magnitude of these
differences is generally small in comparison to the changes induced by different experimental
conditions.

However, the major exception to this finding is the occurrence of new particle formation
in the presence of high levels of GUV222. While the reason for this is not clear, substantial new
particle formation events in the presence of limonene, as well as in outdoor air pumped into the
chamber, are cause for concern for indoor applications due to the relatively high concentrations
of ultrafine particles formed. In real indoor environments, the risk of new particle formation may
be reduced, due to lower average GUV222 fluence rates and ubiquity of surfaces that may
encourage deposition,38 but locally high fluence rates near a GUV222 lamp might still encourage
new particle formation or interact with surface reservoirs of semivolatile compounds in uncertain
ways. Indeed, recent work has detected new particle formation from GUV222 irradiation in a real
indoor space.11 Still, further work is required to fully understand this process, particularly with
regard to the quantification of new particle formation as a function of 222 nm fluence rate and
VOC identity.
For the purposes of deploying GUV222 lamps in indoor spaces, these results provide
confirmation that most (though not all) observed chemistry follows that expected simply from
reaction with ozone, consistent with earlier work.9 While ozone has serious potential as an indoor
air pollutant,14 its chemistry is reasonably well understood. Our results suggest that indoor spaces
with GUV222 lamps may likely be reasonably well-represented in models simply by including the
lamps as an additional source of ozone, and ensuring that all downstream ozone chemistry (e.g.,
formation of OH, OVOCs, and SOA) is represented. Still, additional uncertainties remain,
including the influence of 222 nm light on indoor surfaces and surface-bound organic species, as
well as the cause of GUV222-driven new particle formation. In addition to GUV222-driven ozone
production, the new particle formation observed in this work represents a further reason to keep
GUV222 light intensity to the lowest effective levels when used in indoor spaces.
