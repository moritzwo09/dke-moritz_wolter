Synopsis
In this study, we test the stability of synthetic carboxylate-rich alicyclic molecule standards to both
solar simulated irradiations and microbial incubations, alongside an additional set of biologically or
chemically relevant molecules for comparison. We find that compounds that more resemble the
features of ‘old’ dissolved organic matter are generally more stable in all of our tests.
Abstract
Understanding environmental dissolved organic matter (DOM) relies on the development of methods
capable of navigating its inherent complexity. Although analytical techniques have continually
advanced, leading to improved insight for both bulk and fractionated DOM, the fate of individual
compound classes remains nearly impossible to track with current technology. Previously, we reported
the synthesis of carboxylate rich alicyclic molecule (CRAM) compounds that shared more similar
analytical features with DOM than previously available standards. Here, we adopt an alternative
approach to the conventional use of DOM as a bulk material, by taking our synthesized CRAM
compounds and subjecting them to simulated solar irradiation and microbial incubation experiments
alongside an additional curated set of purchased molecules with chosen biological or chemical
relevance. Irradiation experiments typically showed that compounds bearing only carboxylic acids
and/or alcohols on a saturated carbon backbone were the most resistant to photochemical
degradation, but also that some compounds with CRAM-like formulas and chemical functionality were
notably more stable in the presence of DOM. Within microbial incubations, all of our synthesized
CRAMs were entirely stable after 8-months in various aquatic settings. These sets of experiments
provide support for the proposed stability of CRAM within the environment, as well as providing a
platform from which a more diverse set of molecules can be used to assist in probing the stability of
DOM.
1. Introduction.
Within all of Earth’s bodies of water, dissolved organic matter (DOM) amounts to approximately 700
gigatons of carbon.1 The most important role of DOM within the environment is as a vector for nutrient
transport, specifically between microbes and the decomposition products of life. While the vast

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3ndrr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-6378 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

majority of DOM-turnover occurs through these labile DOM (LDOM) pool metabolites, any readily
available materials are quickly harnessed and re-used by microbes. Conversely, approximately 95% of
DOM at any one point in time is designated as recalcitrant (RDOM) and has a residence half-life in the
ocean of between 4000 and 6000 years.1 Both the sheer size and overwhelming chemical complexity
of this low-reactivity pool of material has puzzled scientists for decades.2
The extremely long lifetime of RDOM is typically explained by three concepts.2,3 Intrinsic chemical
stability hypothesizes that the chemical structures that DOM contains are stable to degradation and
sequestration.4 The dilution hypothesis suggests that DOM is composed of an extremely diverse
mixture of molecules present at tiny concentrations that are not viable for biological utilization, but
would be if present at higher concentrations.5 Finally, restricted or absent essential nutrients can limit
organisms from metabolizing DOM.6,7 Likely, it is all of these factors that contribute to the total stability
of RDOM, which is chemically diverse. Previous attempts to understand the fluxes of RDOM have
investigated the photochemical,8–12 biological,12–15 and sequestrative16–19 processes that affect it.
However, most of these types of studies have examined DOM as a bulk material, often using only
chemical formula assignments to differentiate between chemical class and, by extension, molecular
structure.20–26 This simplification can be seen as necessary due to the limitations of analytical methods
and instruments, but overlooks structural isomerism and its effects on stability, ultimately generalizing
the findings of individual studies.
While the extensive use of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(NMR) in recent decades has improved the understanding of the chemical composition of DOM, these
techniques have crucial limitations. Most importantly, both techniques provide an aggregate view of
any individual DOM dataset, with outputs representing averages of its total composition. NMR data is
frequently bucketed into a few broad and poorly defined regions, hindering nuanced structural
insight.27 Within MS analysis, regions in van Krevelen diagrams are frequently ascribed to classes such
as sugars, proteins, or carboxylate rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). However, one cannot definitively
assign a specific molecular formula to a chemical class based only on MS data, despite this being
common in the field. Critically, isomeric compounds can exhibit radically different reactivity, even if
they belong to the same chemical class, and as a result, any generalization hinders accurate assessment
of the properties of DOM. Compounding this, standards of common classes of RDOM molecules are
mostly unavailable by synthesis or isolation. Without accurate structural description, the
understanding of the chemical behavior of individual RDOM compounds is limited to theory alone, and
pushes discussions on the fluxes and nature of DOM away from evidence and towards speculation.
Recently, our group disclosed the synthesis of simple CRAM analogues.28 As a compound class, CRAM
is hypothesized as one of the largest pools of material within RDOM, and consists of molecules
predominantly built from fused alicyclic rings and furnished with several carboxylic acid
functionalities.29 In our initial work, we showed that the chemical features of eight novel synthetic
analogues more accurately aligned with the postulated features of the theorized environmental CRAM
compound class than previously used compounds, such that they could be used in future experiments
to study the recalcitrant properties of CRAM. Here, we test the stability of our first CRAM standards
alongside an additional curated set of molecules with chosen biological or chemical relevance. The
compounds were subjected to irradiation experiments using a solar simulator, and incubations with
lake and coastal water microbial communities, as well as isolated pelagic fungal strains. The behavior
of the synthesized molecules alongside other pure standards in these settings provides previously
inaccessible information about the stability of individual compounds with CRAM appropriate
functionality and molecular formulas.

in the Supporting Information, including information about quality control.
2.1. Materials. In addition to our 8 synthetic CRAM diastereomeric mixtures, which were combined to
comprise compounds 1-4 purities; 1a - 92%, 1b – 99%, 2a – 90%, 2b – 98%, 3a – 99+%, 3b – 95%, 4a –

94%, 4b – 97%),28 where compounds denoted a have syn stereochemistry at the 1,2-diacid, and
compounds denoted b have anti stereochemistry. Nine commercially-available compounds were
selected to represent general classes of biological molecules; cholic acid (5, 97% purity, terpenoid),28
oleanolic acid (6, >98% purity, terpenoid), Leu-Gly-Gly (7) (≥98%, peptide), syringic acid (8, ≥95%,
phenol/tannin monomer), fraxin (9, ≥95%, coumarin-glycoside conjugate), glycyrrhizic acid (10, ≥95%,
terpenoid-glycoside conjugate), raffinose (11, ≥98%, oligosaccharide), and guanosine monophosphate
(12, ≥95%, nucleotide). An additional compound, 2-(4-(2,2-dicarboxy-ethyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-benzyl)malonic acid (13, purity not listed), was selected as an aromatic CRAM-like equivalent. The CRAM-like
compounds 1-4 were designed based on putative structures described by Hertkorn and colleagues,29
as described previously.28 Cholic acid (5), oleanolic acid (6) and glycyrrhizic acid (10) were selected as
commercially available polycyclic terpenoid molecules of biological origin, which have backbone
similarities to proposed CRAM scaffolds, but different functionality, including a glycoside linkage to a
disaccharide moiety in the case of 10. A peptide (7), sugar (11) and nucleotide (12) were included as
expected labile biological metabolites, and natural products syringic acid (8) and fraxin (9) were
included as aromatic plant metabolites. The aromatic carboxylate rich molecule (13) was included due
to its similarity to proposed CRAM structures and also after its continued use as a DOM-like standard
in the DOM HRMS literature.30–34
Four sample matrices were used in the experiments, Milli-Q water (MQ), artificial seawater (ASW),35
surface lake water (LW) taken in late summer from Långsjö, near Bjorklinge, Sweden: 60°02'31.97" N,
17°33'36.40" E, and coastal seawater (CSW), taken in late summer from the jetty at Tjärnö Marine
Laboratory, Sweden, see supporting information for more details. LW and CSW were filtered (0.7 µm,
GF/F filter), to remove microbes.
Långsjö is regularly sampled as part of a long-term monitoring program in Sweden,36 and water
parameters have been very stable over several years prior to our sampling. Water quality parameters
were measured 9 days before our sampling date, and included TOC 6.3 mg/L, total nitrogen 18 µg/L
and total phosphorus 16.4 µg/L. At Tjärnö, seawater is also measured nearby at Kosterfjörden, and in
the same month as sampling, TOC was measured at 2 mg/L, nitrate+nitrite and phosphate were
measured at 2.66 µM and 0.08 µM (at surface, respectively).37

available compounds 5-13. Functionality discussed later in paper is highlighted in blue.
2.2. Preparation of Compound Mixture and Control Samples. For the 427-hour solar incubation,
microbial community, and isolated fungal experiments, a mixed stock solution was prepared from 113 in dimethyl sulfoxide (at 0.1 mg/ml each) initially into 50:50 methanol:water at 5 ppm concentration
each, before being diluted into MQ, ASW, LW, or CSW to a concentration of 10 ppb (5-13) or 20 ppb
(1-4), due to the combination if 10 ppb of each isomer (i.e. 1a and 2a). For the 93-hour solar
incubations, a mixed stock solution of 1-13 in MQ was diluted into MQ to a concentration of 10 ppb
(5-13) or 20 ppb (1-4), avoiding organic solvents.
2.3. Irradiation Experiments. Irradiation experiments were conducted using a Suntest XXL+FD (Atlas,
Linsengericht-Altenhaßlau, Germany) at 25 °C with an irradiation intensity of 65 W m-2, adjusted over
300-400 nm. The chamber has three xenon lamps whose spectral distribution aligns well with the
international standard CIE 85 (Figure SI1). For the first, longer experiments, samples were continuously
irradiated for 427 hours, compared with 93 hours in the second, shorter experiment. The cumulative
irradiant exposure was 10000 kJ m-2, and 2180 kJ m-2, respectively, corresponding to approximately
132 days and 29 days at sea level, respectively. More information about the irradiation experiments
can be found in the Supporting Information.
2.4. Biological Community Incubation. Samples were prepared using LW and 2% unfiltered lake water
inoculum (experiments LW22 and LW259), or CSW and 2% unfiltered coastal sea water inoculum
(experiment CSW251), before being placed at 20 °C in a dark, temperature-controlled room for 22 days
(LW22), 259 days (LW259), and 251 days (CSW251).
2.5. Marine Fungi Incubation. The marine pelagic fungal cultures used were isolated from open ocean
waters and included Rhodotorula sphaerocarpa, unknown fungal strain ECO1-30, Cladosporium sp, and

Sakaguchia dacryoidea.38 Fungal liquid cultures were performed using ASW inoculated with 1% fresh
fungal suspension over 102 days at 20 °C in the dark.
2.6. Sample Extraction and Analysis. Detailed procedures for extraction, LCMS analysis, and data
analysis for all experiments are provided in the Supporting Information.
2.7 Experimental Considerations. Of the 13 compounds subjected to testing, it was found that 6, 11,
and 12 were not observed in any control or post-experiment samples (Figure SI2). For 11 and 12, this
is likely due to their hydrophilicity preventing their retention during solid-phase extraction (SPE)
extraction (see Figure SI2). Conversely, 6 likely was too insoluble in water to be present in sufficient
amounts for analytical detection.39 Additionally, 8 was not observed in either control or postexperiment samples for either the 250-day LW incubations or the 100-day fungal incubations, likely
due to poor ionization efficiency (see supporting information). The analytical experimental values
shown in Figures 2-4 have only moderate precision and accuracy due to various factors, including 1)
biological variability and general bottle effects, 2) the summing of several isomers for a single reported
value, 3) lack of accurate internal standards for quantification, 4) the experiments were performed on
a mixture 5) the low concentrations used. For these reasons, we focus our discussion on whether
individual compounds were largely unaffected, were partially degraded, or were completely removed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Irradiation Experiments. In the first experiment, compounds 1-13 were irradiated for 427 hours
under simulated solar conditions. Initial stock solutions were prepared using small amounts of DMSO
and methanol to attempt to solubilize hydrophobic compounds before their dilution to 10 ppb
concentrations in water.
To interpret the results of the stability experiments, we have prepared bar graphs that show %
compound remaining relative to the control samples (Figure 2-3 for irradiation experiment, Figure 4
for biological incubation). In these figures, the data shown was first normalized to an internal standard
and then the volume of sample extracted, before averaging of intensities between three replicates and
then comparing the mean value to the control mean (at time zero) as a percentage. The error bar in
such a calculation is determined as the standard error of the difference of means (see supporting
information), which is scaled to the same % scale for the graph. The error bars therefore include
biological, sample preparation and analytical errors for both the experiment and the control samples,
and are larger than the standard error of either the experiment or control means, accounting for the
uncertainty of comparing the two.
For the 427-hour experiment in MQ (Figure 2), all compounds except for CRAMs 1 and 2, cholic acid
(5), and Leu-Gly-Gly (7) were completely degraded. For 5, its reduced carbon backbone and seemingly
unreactive carboxylic acid and alcohol functionalities appear to be stable to degradation. CRAM 1, as
the next most stable compound, contains only carboxylic acid functionalities on a fully reduced carbon
backbone. As such, the greater degradation of 1 compared to 5 could be attributed to either its
increased number of carboxylic acid functionalities, or its lack of hydroxyl groups. For CRAMs 2, 3, and
4, the presence of an alkene, a 1,1-dicarboxylic acid functionality, or both of these features likely led
to their relative instability within this context. Similarly, 10 remained only in trace quantities, with both
its enone functionality and glycosidic linkages likely diminishing its stability. Analogous results are
observed in the ASW samples, with the only key differences being the retention of small amounts of
CRAM 3 and 4, and the loss of peptide 7. The loss of 7 is unusual, and while its loss was consistent
across all three replicates for ASW (and LW, vide infra), we have no chemical reasoning for this loss
and consider it likely to be an artefact.

mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-HRMS) after solid phase extraction. Sol.MQ = Solar Milli-Q water,
Sol.ASW = Solar artificial sea water, Sol.LW = Solar lake water. Compound names and numbers refer to
those in Figure 1.
For the irradiation experiment in LW, CRAMs 1 and 3, and steroid 5 appeared entirely stable, while
syringic acid (8) underwent significantly less degradation than it did in the MQ and ASW experiments.
CRAM 2 and 4 were observed in low quantities, while all other compounds were completely removed.
The remaining levels of 1, 3, 5 and 8 in LW is considerably higher in comparison to both MQ and ASW,
and suggests that the DOM from the sampled LW is protecting these compounds from degradation.
Possibilities for this include the potential for light-screening by DOM (molecules within DOM acting as
quenchers for the tested molecules that could be photochemically excited),40,41 or more reactive
compounds within the sampled DOM preferentially reacting with any generated reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and undergoing modification or mineralization.21,42 While this pool of more reactive
material from DOM that could quench ROS would eventually be exhausted here, in nature it would be
continually replaced by newly leached DOM from catchment soils, depending on the balance of water
residence time of the lake and the amount of sunlight exposure. Assessment of DOM changes from
this sample under the same conditions can be found later in section 3.3.
Examination of the tested compounds by UV-vis spectrophotometry showed that compounds 1-5, 7,
and 11 displayed little or no absorbance that overlapped with the wavelengths of the solar light filter
(see Supporting Information). Conversely, compounds 8-10 and 12-13 absorbed light at wavelengths
between 270 nm and 430 nm. As a potential explanation for the degradation of non-absorbing
molecules, it was considered that 8-10 and 12-13 could become excited and form reactive
intermediates that could immediately react with compounds 1-7 and 11, or go on to form other

reactive intermediates. Similarly, after initial experimentation, we found past experiments we
attempted to dissolve all compounds solely in water, regardless of their solubility.
To investigate various points of contention from the 427-hour experiments, a series of shorter tests
over 93 hours in MQ alone were designed (Figure 3 and SI3). CRAMs 1, 2, and 3 were irradiated
individually, as was a mixture of CRAMs 1, 2, 3 and 4, without additional compounds 5-13, to test
whether the addition of compounds 5-13 was leading to degradation in MQ. Additionally, two separate
experiments were performed on the full mixture of compounds 1-13, one in which no DMSO or
methanol was added, and one where much higher concentrations of both DMSO and methanol was
added compared to the initial experiments (1 molar vs 2.5 mM methanol, 0.14 mM DMSO from the
427-hour experiment). The very high concentration was chosen to provide conditions in which DMSO
and methanol could not be consumed by any produced ROS, and check whether their presence was
hindering or accelerating degradation. Finally, for all six of these experiments (three single compounds,
one CRAM mixture, two compound 1-13 mixtures), additional dark control experiments were
performed to check for sorption onto glass, or potential hydrolysis in water.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3ndrr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-6378 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Figure 3: Solar vs dark control for 93-hour experiments in Milli-Q water. These experiments were to
check the CRAM compound behavior in isolation from the other more reactive compounds in the full
mixture. CRAMs were also irradiated individually, with consistent results. Having 1M DMSO and
methanol in the solvent increased the degradation of CRAMs.
For individual irradiation experiments, triacid CRAMs 1 and 2 were only partially degraded, while
tetraacid alkane 3 underwent complete degradation. This aligns with CRAMs 1 and 2 being the only
two CRAM compounds (alongside cholic acid (5)) remaining in the 427-hour irradiation experiment.
When all four CRAM compounds were mixed in the absence of compounds 5-13, the results were
nearly identical, with triacids 1 and 2 remaining after 93 hours of irradiation, while tetraacids 3 and 4
fully decomposed. Peaks corresponding to decarboxylated triacid products of compound 3 (i.e.
diastereomers of compound 1) were observed, suggesting degradation proceeds via decarboxylation
of the more labile 1,1-diacid functionality.
For all dark control experiments, compounds 1-5, 7-10, and 13 were returned at 100% intensity after
the 93-hour incubation (see Supporting Information), indicating hydrolysis and sorption effects were
minimal. Notably, the absence of UV-visible absorbance overlaps of 3 or 4 with the experimental
irradiation wavelengths (See Supporting Information) suggests that degradation proceeds through
some additional excited species. Although trace impurities could be responsible, LC analysis with
charged aerosol detection showed all tetraacid compounds were at least 94% pure, 28 making extensive
degradation unlikely, assuming reaction occurred on a stoichiometric basis. This would require trace
impurities at sub-part-per-billion levels to react sequentially and degrade the compounds fully. While
the specific mechanism of tetraacid degradation remains unclear, the identification of decarboxylated
products and the lack of degradation in dark controls confirm their instability under the simulated solar
irradiation conditions.
For the 93-hour incubations comprising all compounds 1-13, the exclusion of methanol and DMSO led
to similar results to the 427-hour MQ experiments. CRAM 1 and cholic acid (5) were the least degraded,
CRAM 2 was slightly more degraded than CRAM 1, and all other compounds detectable in the
corresponding control samples were entirely degraded. In comparison, the inclusion of high
concentrations of methanol and DMSO led to far more extensive degradation of all compounds,
including 5, which was completely unaffected in all 427-hour experiments. This, likely, is due to the
generation of other reactive species in the irradiation experiments from these co-solvents. While
concentrations in the 427-hour experiments were low (methanol 2.5 mM, DMSO 0.14 mM), they could
still act as additional reactive species until their consumption if ROS were being produced by other
photo-excitable molecules. As such, these shorter control experiments suggest the presence of these

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3ndrr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-6378 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

co-solvents in the 427-hour experiment might result in slightly overestimated degradation relative to
comparable environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the trends observed in the 427-hour MQ
experiments are reinforced by the 93-hour experiments in which both methanol and DMSO were
excluded.
Further experimentation is ultimately required to determine the mechanisms of degradation for CRAM
compounds 2-4 under these conditions. This will involve testing the breakdown pathways of these
molecules individually. At the environmentally-analogous concentrations (20 ppb combined between
several stereoisomers) used in these experiments, detection of degradation products by LCMS is
difficult. As such, experiments exploring the mechanistic pathways that lead to their breakdown in this
setting will require testing at higher concentrations, extraction volumes, or more sensitive equipment,
but are an important direction for future exploration. Furthermore, expanding the set of available
CRAM-like molecules to include compounds with broader functional group and carbon-backbone
diversity will help to examine whether all reduced CRAM-like scaffolds are stable under these
irradiation conditions, or whether the decalin (two fused 6-membered rings) structure employed here
is part of a sub-group of stable scaffolds.
3.2 Biological Incubations. For the biological incubations in both LW and CSW, CRAMs 1-4 and tetracarboxylic acid 13 were unaffected by microbial communities. Due to challenges in accurate
quantification (see Section 2.7 and Supporting Information), we treat any result over 100% as
indicating that a compound remains, rather than that compounds of identical mass and retention time
have been produced during the experiment. However, establishing this definitively would require
further experimentation. In contrast, all other detected compounds were completely removed in
community incubation experiments, with the exception of 9, which was observed only in trace
quantities in the LW community after 22 days. It is noteworthy that nutrient conditions of the selected
waters were on the oligotrophic side (particularly for phosphate), see section 2.1, but these lower
nutrient conditions did not limit the usage of compounds 5 and 7-10, indicating an active microbial
community was able to consume labile compounds in these experiments. It is perhaps unsurprising
that compounds 5 and 7-10 are degraded in biological incubations; microbial life has evolved a range
of mechanisms that utilize natural products as substrates for enzymatic reactions, leading to their
degradation or modification.46–49 Tripeptides such as 7 are derived from universal amino acid
monomers, 9 and 10 contain energy rich sugar functionalities, 8 is a common plant metabolite, and
bile acids such as 5 are readily degraded by soil and water bacteria.47

In comparison to the microbial community experiments, few isolated fungal species appeared capable
of degrading any of the tested compounds (Figure SI4). Ultimately, 7 and 9 were reliably degraded by
the fungal strains Rhodotorula sphaerocarpa and unknown fungal strain ECO1-30, and 10 was partially
degraded by Cladosporium sp. Syringic acid (8) was not detected in the controls or tests in this dataset.
While the fungal degradation of bile acids is generally known,50,51 and fungi possess cytochrome P450
(CYP) enzymes capable of the oxidation of a wide-number of substrates,52,53 the strains used here were
unable to degrade cholic acid (5) in this context, a clear difference from the community experiments.
It should be noted that natural microbial communities often collaborate by co-degrading organic
matter and utilizing each other's breakdown by-products.54 As the fungal species in this study were
incubated individually, this community effect was absent, limiting the diversity of enzymes required
for the degradation of complex material. However, the inability for both environmental microbial
communities and isolated fungal strains to degrade CRAM-like analogues 1-4 or tetra-carboxylic acid
13 provides valuable evidence for their biological recalcitrance. Ultimately, CRAMs 1-4 represent only
a small portion of the scaffolds and functional group compositions that make up natural CRAM, and as
such, a broader range of compounds, as well as additional microbes, must be tested to determine the
extent of environmental CRAMs biological recalcitrance.
3.3 Experimental effects on Lake DOM
In the lake water experiments (i.e. Sol.LW, LW22 and LW259), the lake water used as a matrix for study
of compound stability contained thousands of molecular formulas from DOM in the sample. The
identity of the compounds making up these molecular formulas is unknown, as explained in the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3ndrr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-6378 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

introduction, and each molecular formula is constituted by an unknown number of structural isomers.
Despite the lack of knowledge of the chemical structures making up DOM, it is possible to measure
changes to the mixture, at least to the portion that is ionizable to deprotonated ions by electrospray,
using direct infusion HRMS or LC-HRMS. Using the data already in hand from LC-HRMS analysis of
compounds 1-13, we assessed overall ‘molecular formula level’ changes to the DOM mixture in the
triplicate samples at experimental conditions LW-control (time zero), Sol.LW and LW22, as these were
measured in the same analytical run.
Assessment of the lake water DOM changes after experiments showed minor but statistically
significant changes in the irradiation experiment (Sol.LW), and essentially no detectable changes in the
biological degradation experiment (LW22), in line with recent findings regarding biodegradability of
SPE-DOM by ESI-MS from the same lake (Table 1).55 This lack of apparent change is partly due to the
limitations of SPE and ESI in measuring the hydrophilic, labile species, rather than due to lack of
degradation of total DOC. The changes found to the more hydrophobic part of the DOM mixture in the
irradiation experiment were in line with expectations, with higher molecular weight, unsaturated
compounds being the most sensitive to loss (Figure 5).

Figure 5: a) Compounds detected in lake water DOM, colored according to relative loss in the longer
irradiation experiment (Sol.LW). Each compound is plotted at the determined H/C ratio vs. m/z, and all
compounds detected in the lake water control sample are shown. Point size is shown according to
square root of intensity (mean, n=3), for scaling purposes (i.e. in order to see more peaks). Color is
shown according to the difference in relative intensity between the irradiated and control sample
(irradiated/control x 100), where initial values were normalized per sample to sum to 100. This means
that the difference is not quantitative (i.e. showing % loss), but rather qualitative, showing extent of
change relative to other peaks in the sample. The color scale is limited to 100 to focus on the peaks that
had a relative loss of intensity, and the points were plotted in decreasing color order, to highlight the
peaks that were lost. b) Bray Curtis Dissimilarity based cluster dendrogram with cutoff set to 15%

scores in the first two dimensions (totaling 82% of data variability), with H/Cwa indicated by colour.
3.4 Research Outcomes and Future Directions. In the irradiation experiments, tests probing the
physical and chemical stability of our initial CRAM-analogues 1-4 within a small curated chemical
library highlighted that specific chemical functionalities were the strongest indicator of stability. CRAM
1 and cholic acid (5) were the only compounds that remained in significant quantities in after
irradiation. The majority of compounds that contained 1,1-diacid, enone, and aromatic functionalities
were either completely degraded or remained only in trace quantities in all experiments, and the
presence of DOM only partially protected some of those same compounds. As an exception, CRAMlike compound 3, which contained a 1,1-diacid, and had a fully reduced backbone remained unaffected
after irradiation in the presence of DOM, as did triacid CRAM 1 with its fully reduced carbon backbone.
Notably, CRAM alkenes 2 and 4 were not protected to the same extent by lake water DOM. Future
experiments will probe the mechanisms through which DOM protects alkane CRAM-like compounds
by assessing the extent to which it screens light, preferentially reacts with ROS, and whether it can
directly quench photo-excited compounds with molecular compositions relevant to DOM.
Furthermore, select compounds will have their breakdown products tracked, to examine potential
degradation pathways for compounds with CRAM-like chemical formulas in the environment.
Within the set of biological experiments, a compound’s existence as a direct biological metabolite was
the best indicator of its stability to challenges by either microbial communities or isolated fungal
strains. It is notable that no member of either microbial community was able to harness any of the
CRAM analogues 1-4 or tetra-carboxylic acid 13 over approximately eight months under warm
conditions (20 °C). This, of course, could be simply due to the fact that these compounds are not known
biological substrates. Similarly, it is likely that a significant portion of recalcitrant DOM is modified by
abiotic processes,3 being derived from the geochemical degradation of biological compounds through
reaction with light and ROS.56 Thus, the stability of these synthesized compounds in this context is in
part indicative of the broader recalcitrance to biological challenges of geochemically-processed
compounds with CRAM-like functionalities and molecular formulas. Further investigation of biological
recalcitrance will focus predominantly on the diversification of CRAM-analogue scaffolds, to test
whether specific carbon backbones may render these compounds biologically available. Additionally,
tests tailored towards the aggregation and complexation of these compounds are envisioned to
expand this initial set of recalcitrance experiments upon isolated CRAM-like compounds.
