Abstract

13

Atmospheric formation of persistent perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) is a route to global

14

contamination, including drinking water sources. We present high time resolution measurements

15

of C2-C6 PFCAs in ambient air made over 6 weeks each in winter and summer 2022 in Toronto,

16

Canada. Observations were made using chemical ionization mass spectrometry with acetate

17

ionization with care taken to avoid system contamination. Measurements of trifluoroacetic acid

18

(C2 PFCA) are reported at 1-minute time resolution, while those for C 3-C6 PFCAs are at 10-

19

minute time resolution. Variations with time and relationships to meteorology and other

20

pollutants show evidence of secondary formation of all observed PFCAs except

21

perfluoropropionic acid (C3 PFCA). High time resolution data allows these unique observations,

22

allowing for improved process and source understanding moving forward. Mixing ratios of TFA

Introduction
Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, F(CF2)nCOOH) are a class of persistent

36

compounds that are found globally, among which several are bioaccumulative and toxic. 1–3

37

PFCAs are one of the most problematic sub-classes of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances

38

(PFAS). Multiple jurisdictions have proposed class-based regulations for PFAS to counter their

39

negative impacts.4,5 Regulations are currently in place for PFCAs and their precursors with ≥8

40

carbons, leading to replacements based on short-chain (≤7 carbons) and ultra-short-chain (≤4

41

carbons) C-F backbones.6,7 Thus, observed short- and ultra-short-chain PFCA levels in the

42

environment have been increasing.8 Recent studies have shown particularly large increases in the

43

environmental abundance of C2 PFCA, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).9,10

44

Short-chain PFCAs are volatile in their acidic form and can be emitted to air from point

45

sources (e.g., industrial facilities,11 fluoropolymer thermolysis,12 wastewater treatment

46

plants13,14), though as strong acids they are expected to have short atmospheric lifetimes. 15 Their

47

presence in remote terrestrial regions can be attributed primarily to atmospheric oxidation from

48

volatile PFAS, such as fluorotelomer compounds, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and

49

hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), with shorter-chain PFCAs having more precursors. 10,16,17

50

Atmospheric formation impacts atmospheric PFCA levels globally, 15,18–20 though the relative

51

importance of direct emission, remobilization of PFCAs (e.g., by sea spray aerosols 21), and

52

atmospheric formation are not well understood. In samples derived from the atmosphere, PFCA

53

abundance is generally inversely proportional to carbon chain length, with TFA levels much

54

higher than all others.18,22

55

Understanding the sources and fate of atmospheric PFCAs has been hampered by

56

analytical methods. Measurements of atmospheric PFCAs have been made using time-integrated

57

samples, such as atmospheric deposition or air collected onto sorbents/denuders, followed by

58

offline analysis (e.g., 13,14,18,19,23). This limits the temporal resolution of the samples to several

59

days to months, though a single study measured TFA using denuders over five days with a time

60

resolution of four hours.24 Atmospheric conditions can change quickly, with parameters that

61

affect chemistry (e.g., solar irradiance) changing on the timescales of minutes to hours. Fast, in-

62

situ measurements that can determine atmospheric concentrations on similar timescales to these

63

atmospheric processes are needed to improve our understanding of PFCA chemistry and sources.

64

A method commonly used to measure atmospheric acids at high time resolution is chemical

65

ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS, e.g., 25–28). Detection of PFCAs using CIMS has been

66

demonstrated in the lab with iodide29,30 and acetate31 ionizations. Recently, TFA was observed in

67

ambient air using iodide-CIMS, though <1% of measurements were above the limit of

68

detection.32

69

Here, we quantify ambient gaseous PFCAs using CIMS in an urban region across two

70

seasons. This first application of CIMS to quantify ambient PFCAs will be used to assess the

71

importance of high time resolution data to understand their sources.

72

Methods
The CIMS was a modified version of that used previously. 33 Modifications included

73
74

altering the method of pressure control and reagent ion delivery, as well as replacing the

75

stainless-steel ion molecule reactor with a polytetrafluoroethene custom design (Figure S1) that

76

was operated at lower pressures than previously described. The time resolution of the instrument

77

was 10 s. Prior to use, all fluoropolymer components were pre-cleaned by sonicating in

78

deionized water and baking at 80 °C in a vacuum oven (<0.5 mBar) for 24 hours.

79

Calibration was performed using acetate ionization with a Fluigent microfluidic control

80

system to generate microlitre flows of aqueous acids into a nebulizer housed in a heated oven.

81

Rapid and quantitative evaporation resulted in gaseous acids from the liquid solutions, which

82

were diluted and added at various concentrations via a pre-cleaned perfluoroalkoxy alkane inlet

83

to the CIMS. The calibration source output for TFA was validated by denuder collection and

84

offline analysis,34,35 but not for other PFCAs. The ratio of measured versus calculated output

85

from the aqueous concentration for TFA was applied to the other PFCAs (see SI Text S1, Table

86

S1).

Measurements were made in Toronto, Canada at two locations (separated by ~4 km)

88

during 2021 and 2022 (Figure S2). In 2021, measurements were made at the York University

89

rooftop (43.7738 N, 79.5071 W) from 29 August to 6 September using iodide ionization. In

90

2022, measurements were made at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)

91

Downsview (43.7814 N, 79.4685 W) from 8 February to 10 April (‘winter’) and 26 June to 22

92

August (‘summer’) using acetate ionization. All times are in Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC

93

– 5). Samples were collected through a polyethylene inlet (1/4” outer diameter; 3/16” inner

94

diameter; length ~2 m in 2021, 1.5 m in 2022). Automated blanks were conducted for 10 min

95

every hour by overflowing the inlet near the sampling end with air passed through a 400 °C Pt

96

catalyst and acid trapping filter material (sodium bicarbonate; United filtration Inc.). These

97

blanks accounted for potential off-gassing from inlet and CIMS components. The ECCC location

98

was co-located with a National Air Pollution Surveillance Program site that measures several

99

pollutants (e.g., O3, CO). Irradiance measurements were made at the York University site.

100

Limits of detection (LODs) for PFCAs were calculated according to Bertram et al. 36 Three times

101

the standard deviation of each blank signal was used to create real-time LODs. Ambient signals

102

were compared to the LOD determined from the blank collected immediately before. The

103

decrease in signal at the onset of the blanks was also used to assess the instrument response time

104

for TFA. Analyte signals were normalized to reagent ion signals and background subtracted.

Results and Discussion

109

Method performance: I-CIMS, and acetate CIMS

110

Fluoropolymers are a known source of PFCAs25,35 with previous CIMS instruments

111

noting PFCA ions in their background measurements, which were attributed to fluoropolymers in

112

the instrument and inlet.25 Our instrument modifications resulted in background signals that were

113

relatively clean of PFCA signals (Figure S3) although non-zero, resulting in LODs that made

114

ambient measurements at the expected low levels achievable.

115

Measurements in summer 2021 using I-CIMS resulted in signals attributable to PFCAs,

116

with TFA as the highest signal. We observed masses consistent with the TFA iodide adduct (m/z

117

240.897, C2F3O2HI-) and the conjugate base of TFA (m/z 112.985, C 2F3O2-). The iodide adduct

118

signal was always larger (by >3.65 times) and relative signals were highly variable (Figure S4).

119

Previous I-CIMS PFCA laboratory measurements reported adducts as the dominant ions with

120

small quantities of the conjugate bases, which were attributed to proton transfer to the reagent

121

ion (see SI).30 However, the variability of our relative ion signals suggests that ambient

122

measurement conditions were affecting the ionization. An ozone-dependent competing ionization

123

mechanism for I-CIMS has been previously reported for acids. 37,38 Iodine oxides (e.g., IO-)

124

formed from reaction between the iodide reagent ion and ambient ozone could react with acids

125

(HA) to form their conjugate base via proton transfer:

126

O3 + I- → IO- + O2

127

IO- + HA → HOI + A-

128

We observed higher ratios of conjugate base to adduct at higher levels of ambient ozone, during

129

which higher IO- was also observed (Figure S4). This is qualitatively consistent with the

130

proposed ozone-dependent ionization.37,38 Thus, quantification of ambient PFCAs using I-CIMS

131

would be complex, likely requiring multi-dimensional calibrations involving humidity and ozone

132

corrections. To avoid interferences and simplify CIMS application to PFCAs, I-CIMS was not

133

pursued further, and an alternate ionization (acetate) applied.31

134

Measurements in 2022 in winter and summer using acetate-CIMS resulted in signals

135

attributable to several PFCAs. All PFCAs were observed solely as their conjugate base ion

136

without any ozone or humidity dependencies.31 In winter, all PFCAs from TFA (C2) to PFHxA

137

(C6) were detectable. In summer, PFPrA (C3) could not be measured because of another

138

insufficiently resolved peak in the mass spectrum.

139

The acetate-CIMS response time for TFA was determined by fitting a double exponential

140

function to the signal decrease upon the onset of each blank. Median response times, defined as

141

the e-folding time (1/e) were faster than 25 s, with the slowest response times remaining less

142

than 1 min (Figure S5). Thus, 1-min TFA measurements can be reliably reported for this

143

configuration. The 1-min LODs for TFA ranged from 0.010 to 0.407 pptv (10 -12 mol mol-1),

144

which are comparable to the lowest LODs reported for CIMS measurements for any chemical

145

using any ionization (Tables S2, S3, Figure S6).32,36,39,40 Among over 145,000 1-min TFA

146

measurements, 92.63 % were above LOD. All other PFCAs had lower observed signals, so data

147

was averaged to 10 min. For these compounds, LODs were <46 ppqv (10 -15 mol mol-1, Table S2)

148

and detection frequencies ranged from 92 % for PFBA to >99 % for PFPeA and PFHxA (Table

149

S4).

150

Ambient measurements of gaseous TFA

151

Observed mixing ratios of TFA ranged from <LOD to 1.72 pptv (<LOD to ~8.76 ng m -3;

152

Figure 1, Table S1, estimated mass concentrations in SI). Our measurements are generally

153

consistent with previous gas-phase TFA measurements made with denuders in the United States,

Canada, and China between 1994 and 2021 23,24,34,41,42 and with I-CIMS in the United States in

155

202332 (Table S6). Seven 48-hr gaseous TFA measurements were made in Toronto between June

156

and December 2000, reporting a median of 0.25 pptv (range 0.06 to 1.06 pptv). 23 We can

157

compare directly to these observations using a moving 48-hr average of our measurements,

158

which leads to winter and summer median values of 0.40 and 0.51 pptv, respectively (range of

159

0.24 to 0.84 pptv, Figure S6). Thus, our mean measurements are about two times higher than, but

160

within the range of, the measurements made in 2000. This is surprising, given that TFA has been

161

shown to be rapidly increasing in the atmosphere over this period. 9,10 We note that some previous

162

TFA measurements, including those made in Toronto, used PFPrA acid as an internal

163

standard,24,42 for which the presence of atmospheric PFPrA10,18 could have affected the accuracy.

164

Mixing ratios for TFA were generally higher in summer, with a median of 0.412 pptv

165

(<LOD to 0.932 pptv) in winter and 0.519 pptv (<LOD to 1.511 pptv) in summer (Figure 1,

166

Table 1). Similar seasonal differences have previously been observed in samples collected over

167

one year in Canada,23 and over several years in Beijing.24,42,43 We also observed that mixing

168

ratios were generally higher during the day (Figures 1, 2). The highest average TFA was

169

observed at 15:00 EST in winter and 16:30 in summer and the lowest at 06:30 in winter and

170

05:30 in summer. This is consistent with a previous study that measured gaseous TFA with 4-hr

171

time resolution over five days in January in Beijing. 24

Ambient measurements of other gaseous PFCAs

180

In the absence of calibration correction factors for C 3 to C6 PFCAs, we estimated their

181

mixing ratios using information from TFA corrections. While mixing ratios estimated with this

182

approach are more uncertain (estimated ±150%, Table S1), relative variations are reliable. To our

183

knowledge, gaseous PFCAs ≥C4 have been measured at timescales ≥2 days,22 while the rare

184

measurements of gaseous PFPrA have been made by sampling for >1 month. 34,44 We observed

185

median levels in the range of 10s of ppqv for PFCAs in both seasons, with levels higher in

186

summer than winter (Table S5). Generally, PFPrA was highest and PFBA was lowest. This

187

contrasts the few existing atmospheric samples, in which levels decreased with increasing chain

188

length (e.g., 10,18,34). Given the uncertainties in our estimated mixing ratios and the known issues

189

associated with offline gaseous PFCA sampling,45,46 it is challenging to quantitatively compare

190

our results to previous reports. For C 4-C6 PFCAs, a diurnal variation was observed in both winter

191

and summer, though a much stronger variation was seen in summer (Figure 2B). For PFPrA,

there was no discernible variation in signal with time of day. These represent the first

observations of time-of-day variation for ≥C3 PFCAs.

202

Gaseous PFCA source attribution
High time response measurements allow us to better understand PFCA sources by

203

relating changes in concentrations to other quickly changing variables (e.g., wind direction),

204

which is impossible with time integrated samples. Higher levels during the day were observed

205

for PFCAs except PFPrA (Figures 2B, S6, S7). Both irradiance and temperature are higher

206

during daytime, indicating that increased gaseous PFCAs could result from atmospheric

207

formation or gas-particle partitioning. For PFPrA, we observed positive correlations with formic

208

acid (r=0.56) and temperature (r=0.59). For all other PFCAs, positive correlations with ozone

209

(0.29<r<0.59), formic acid (0.39<r<0.50), and temperature (0.31<r<0.52) were seen (Figure S8).

210

These correlations represent the strongest among all environmental variables tested. Correlations

211

with photochemically-formed ozone and formic acid suggest that atmospheric formation is an

212

important source of PFCAs in Toronto. Correlations with temperature are consistent with

213

atmospheric formation but could suggest the role of gas-particle partitioning. However, most of

214

these PFCAs are expected to reside in the gas phase23,24,42–44,46 and correlations between PFCAs

215

and PM2.5 were negligible (r<0.1) and independent of humidity (Figure S9). This suggests gas-

216

particle partitioning may act as a minor PFCA source. It is also possible that point sources 11–14,47

217

could directly release gaseous PFCAs. Similar PFCA levels were measured from all wind

218

directions, with slightly higher levels associated with southwest winds (Figures S10, S11).

219

Airmasses arriving in Toronto from the southwest are known to be more polluted and enrichment

220

with southwest winds is common for other pollutants. 48,49 Weak to negligible correlations were

221

observed between PFCAs and chemical markers for direct emissions, such as CO (-0.13<r<0.14)

222

and SO2 (r<0.16, Figure S8), suggesting a minimal contribution of direct emissions. Some

223

pollutant sources may also differ between weekdays and weekends/holidays. 50 For PFCAs except

224

PFPrA, levels were generally higher on weekends, with some time periods significantly higher

225

(Table S7). This is consistent with lower weekend NO x (≡NO+NO2), where yields of

226

atmospherically-formed PFCAs (and ozone350) are higher under lower NOx conditions.15,51,52

227

Overall, our observations most strongly support atmospheric formation as the major source of

228

PFCAs, with a potential small contribution of gas-particle partitioning.

229

For TFA atmospheric formation, several modelling studies have examined the potential

230

for volatile organofluorine compounds to contribute to gaseous TFA. Models generally predict

231

10s of ppqv of TFA or its immediate precursors (i.e., trifluoroacyl halides) from degradation of

232

HCFCs and HFCs for the region including Toronto, 53–55 which is much lower than our

233

observations, indicating the importance of other sources. Recently introduced hydrofluoroolefins

234

(HFOs) that produce TFA in high yields represent an additional potential source. For example,

235

predicted Toronto mixing ratios for full-scale implementation of HFO-1234yf into mobile air

236

conditioners are up to 1 pptv.20,55 These models are in reasonable agreement with our

237

observations, though they represent usage scenarios where all vehicles contain HFO-1234yf,

238

which is not currently the case. Thus, we suggest there are additional precursor sources that

239

contribute to gaseous TFA. Numerous additional TFA precursors are known to be present in the

240

atmosphere (e.g., halogenated anaesthetics, fluorotelomer compounds) 51 for which predicted

241

atmospheric levels do not exist. Given that our observations of TFA are consistent with

242

atmospheric formation as the dominant source, further work is needed to identify specific TFA

243

precursor molecules as well as better constrain the sources of longer-chain PFCAs for which no

244

model-predicted gaseous levels exist.

Implications

246

We quantified gas-phase TFA with 1-min time resolution and C 3-C6 PFCAs with 10-min

247

time resolution in Toronto, with the strongest evidence indicating photochemical production as

248

the dominant source for all PFCAs except PFPrA. This indicates atmospheric formation is an

249

important source of PFCAs in urban areas as well as remote regions. Our observations

250

underscore the need for further atmospheric measurements of both PFCAs and their potential

251

precursors. While predictions46 and limited reliable measurements23,24,42–44 suggest these PFCAs

252

are predominantly in the gas phase, the overall importance of particulate phase PFCAs as a

253

source and/or sink of gaseous PFCAs is not well understood. Lastly, the abundance of PFCAs in

254

air also demonstrates the importance of understanding inhalation as an exposure pathway, which

255

is currently unknown.
