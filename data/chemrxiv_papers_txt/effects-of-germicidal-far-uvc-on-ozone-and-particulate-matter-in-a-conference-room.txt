Introduction

The application of 222 nm light from KrCl excimer lamps (GUV222 or Far-UVC) is a promising
approach to reduce the indoor transmission of airborne pathogens, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
GUV222 inactivates airborne pathogens and is believed to be relatively safe for human skin and
eye exposure. However, UV light initiates photochemical reactions which may negatively impact
indoor air quality. We conducted a series of experiments to assess the formation of ozone (O 3),
and resulting formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), induced by commercial far-UVC
devices in an office environment (small conference room) with an air exchange rate of 1.3 h-1. We
studied scenarios with a single far-UVC lamp, corresponding to the manufacturer’s
recommendations for disinfection of a space that size, and with four far-UVC lamps, to test
conditions of greater far-UVC fluence. The single lamp did not significantly impact O3 or fine
particulate matter levels in the room. Consistent with previous studies in the literature, the higher
far-UVC fluences lead to increases in O3 of 5 to 10 ppb above background, and minor increases in
particulate matter (16% ± 10 % increase in particle number count). The use of far-UVC at minimum
intensities required for disinfection, and in conjunction with adequate ventilation rates (e.g.
ANSI/ASHRAE recommendations), may allow the reduction of airborne pathogen levels while
minimizing the formation of air pollutants in furnished indoor environments.

The dominant pathway of transmission for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza,
and respiratory syncytial virus, is airborne (aerosol) transmission [1,2]. In this scenario, an infected
person emits respiratory aerosols containing pathogens which may be inhaled by others, leading
to infection. Indoor gatherings, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated settings, pose a higher
risk of transmission. Engineering solutions, including adequate ventilation and air filtration, can
reduce transmission risk [3,4].
Germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light has been proposed as another promising tool for reducing
the risk of airborne virus transmission indoors. UV light is well-known to inactivate or kill bacteria
and viruses on surfaces and in aerosols [5-11], but drawbacks include the potentially harmful
impacts of UV rays on human skin and eyes. The use of light in the far-UVC range (200-235 nm)
minimizes these negative impacts. Far-UVC is effective at inactivating or killing microorganisms,
including bacteria, viruses, and fungi [12-17]. Research indicates that 222 nm light from KrCl
excimer lamps (far-UVC) has minimal adverse effects on the skin and eyes, attributable to a limited
ability for the radiation to penetrate deeply into biological materials [12,18-20]. Due to its ability
to inactivate airborne pathogens and relative safety, far-UVC has been recommended for use
indoors to inactivate pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 [11].
Besides direct damage to skin and eyes, another potential drawback of GUV is negative
impacts on indoor air quality due to photochemistry. Oxygen photodissociates in the presence of
high energy light (wavelengths shorter than 242 nm):

The atomic oxygen generated reacts with O2 to yield ozone (O3).
(R2)

Acute and long-term exposure to elevated levels of O3, a respiratory irritant and strong oxidant,
is harmful to human health [21]. O3 also contributes to fine particulate matter levels by oxidizing
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to form semivolatile or water-soluble products, a process
known as secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Terpene compounds associated with scent
products in indoor environments, such as limonene, are particularly reactive towards O3 and have
high SOA formation potential [22]. For this reason, studies of the impact of GUV on indoor air
quality have included measurements of ozone formation [25-31] and SOA formation [25,26,30,31].
While ozone formation chemistry has been studied extensively for broad spectrum solar light
in the outdoor context [23,24], the effects of far-UVC indoors are less well-known. Recent
numerical modeling [25,26] and laboratory [26-30] studies show that 222 nm far-UVC can increase
ozone levels [25-30] and SOA formation [25,26,30]. The laboratory studies were mostly performed
in reactor systems with low or no ventilation. These systems differ in important ways from an
indoor office environment, which is ventilated and has various reactive surfaces which act as sinks
for ozone [27,32]. Peng and coworkers observed O3 production and decay from the use of far-UVC

(room averaged rate = 2.0 W cm-2) in a small, low-ventilation (0.62-0.96 h-1) office setting [27].
They found steady-state production of around 6.5 ppb O3, with an inferred O3 deposition rate of
0.5-2.3 h-1.
Here, we report the impact of commercial far-UVC lamps with a range of intensities on ozone
and submicron aerosol particle levels in an indoor office environment (small conference room).

Methods
Room Setup. The study was conducted in a small conference room (4.62m × 2.74m, 3.30m ceiling
height) within an office suite in a 19-story academic building at Columbia University’s Morningside
Heights campus in New York, NY, USA from March 2023 to January 2024. The building, constructed
in 1961, has a centralized mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. We refer
to this room as “Room A.” Room A has no window, and is connected via a door to a large, open
plan lounge area in the office suite. This Lounge space was used for baseline measurements. The
door between Room A and the Lounge was closed during experiments. The air exchange rate in
Room A was measured using the CO2 tracer method [33] with portable CO2 sensors (Aranet4) to
be 1.3 h-1 (Supplementary Information). Room A and the lounge are carpeted. Room A is equipped
with a conference table, a small wooden desk, and chairs. It also has room lighting and a wallmounted computer monitor. Within the experimental duration none of the electronics were
turned on.

Far-UVC Source. During the study, the room was equipped with either one or four commercial
fixtures to generate far-UVC radiation. Tests with a single fixture used a Lumenlabs Lumenizer 300
(Lumenlabs, Shanghai, China) and tests with four fixtures used Lumenlabs Zone devices. Each of
these fixtures contains three optically filtered KrCl bulbs with a peak emission wavelength of 222
nm. The optical output of a Lumenizer fixture is 55 mW and the optical output of a single Zone
fixture is 190 mW. According to the manufacturer, each Lumenizer 300 fixture is capable of
disinfecting a 4m x 4m room; therefore, a single Lumenizer 300 unit would be normally deployed
for a room the size of Room A in this study. That is to say, the single lamp tests represent “typical”
operating conditions for this room and the four-lamp tests were performed to test a higher
intensity condition. Lamps were placed on the floor and oriented towards the ceiling for all tests;
this placement is unconventional and not recommended for installation, but allowed for
temporary deployment for these tests. A model of the small conference room including the farUVC fixtures was generated using Visual Lighting software with the GUV package (Acuity Brands,
Atlanta, GA) (Supplementary Information). The model was also used to compute the average and
maximum horizontal irradiance at 1.8 m down from the ceiling for each installation. Since the lamp
arrangement is flipped in the room from a typical ceiling installation, measuring 1.8 down from
the ceiling represents the measurement at 1.8 above floor height which is typically used to
evaluate installations for safety exposure limits as recommended in the ANSI/IES RP-27.1–22

standard. The model for the single lamp installation yielded an average irradiance of 0.2 W cm-2
and a maximum irradiance of 0.9 W cm-2 at 1.8 m height. The model for the four lamp installation
yielded an average irradiance of 4.1 W cm-2 and a maximum irradiance of 9.0 W cm-2 at 1.8 m
height. For context, the 8-hour Threshold Limit Values recommended by ACGIH for the eye and
skin for 222 nm exposure are 160 mJ cm-2 and 480 mJ cm-2, which equate to average irradiance

values of 5.5 W cm-2 and 16.6 W cm-2, respectively [34]. The 8-hour exposure limit
recommended by the ICNIRP for 222 nm exposure is 23 mJ cm-2, which equates to an average

irradiance of 0.8 W cm-2 [35]. The 4-lamp experiments were meant to show the ozone and SOA
production under higher intensity conditions, more similar to those used in previous studies in the
literature.
Ozone and particle measurements. Ozone monitors (2B Technologies, Model 202 Series
#2544) were used for ozone measurement inside the conference room and outside in a lounge
area where the far-UVC lamps were not present, to obtain a background signal. The concentration
was recorded for approximately 8 hours during the daytime at 10-second intervals, measured in
units of ppb, and an hourly average reading was computed.
The particle size distribution in the 11.1nm-1.1µm range was monitored during experiments
using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) (Grimm Technologies). The SMPS scan frequency
was 7 minutes. Some experiments were performed with only ozone or SMPS measurement.
Experimental design. The two ozone monitors and/or the SMPS were turned on at the start
of the experiments. Background signal was obtained. After the background period, the far-UVC
source (1 or 4 lamps) was turned on in the conference room and no change was made to the

area had a strong linear correlation throughout the 10-hour experiment (  = 0.96).

In summary, experiments performed with a single far-UVC lamp did not result in a significant
change in ozone or fine particulate levels compared to background concentrations in Room A and
the lounge. When higher lamp intensity was applied, a small but measurable increase in ozone
levels was detected, with concentrations rising by up to 10 ppb above background. Additionally, a
small increase in particulate matter was observed (16% ± 10 % increase in particle number count).
Details are provided in the following paragraphs.
Ozone. The 15 minute-averaged measured ozone level in Room A and in the outside lounge
for a typical single-lamp experiment is shown in Figure 1. Background ozone level in the office
suite (Room A and lounge area) drifted between 2-20 ppb during the course of the experiments,
which lasted up to 10 daytime hours, reaching a peak during midday. This trend suggests that the
changes were driven by outdoor ozone concentrations [36]. After 2 hours, a single far-UVC lamp
was turned on in the closed Room A. The ozone levels in Room A continued to track the
concentrations in the lounge area, and in fact were 2-3 ppb lower, likely due to higher rates of
ozone deposition in the small furnished room. The ozone measurements in Room A and the lounge

Particle Concentration and Size Distribution. The evolution of particle number and mass
concentrations in room A for a single far-UVC lamp is illustrated in Figure 3a and 3b. Background
data were collected for the initial 35 minutes of the experiment. Subsequently, far-UVC was
activated and remained on for 35 minutes, during which particle concentrations continued to be
monitored. The comparison of particle counts within the entire 70-minute experimental period
reveals consistent particle concentrations, with no discernible variation observed when the farUVC lamp was activated (Figure 3a). Particulate matter in Room A typically exhibited a lognormal
size distribution with a peak particle size of around 60 nm. The particle size distribution did not
change significantly when the far-UVC lamp was turned on (Figure 3b).

was 0.2 W cm-2. According to the manufacturer, one lamp is recommended for disinfection of a
room the size of Room A. The modelled average fluence and irradiance values are consistent with
conditions observed by Eadie et al. in a chamber study to reduce airborne pathogens (S. aureus)
by 92% or more [16]. Under these conditions, we did not measure significant changes in ozone
level or particulate matter in Room A, despite the relatively low ventilation conditions in the room.

Averaging data from four single-lamp experiments, we find that the particle number count
changes by 142 ± 546 particles cm-3 (0.3% ± 3.6% change in number count). Error bars were
calculated by propagation of error from the raw experimental data followed by weighted linear
least squares averaging. Statistics from only one dataset are available for the high intensity
experiment; the observed change was 354 ± 218 particles cm-3 (16% ± 10 % change in number
count). We note significant variability in the background particle counts, particularly for
experiments conducted in Summer 2023.

We note that, if SOA formation is occurring, this could manifest either as new particle
formation and growth or as addition of mass to background aerosols. The stable particle number
counts and the particle size distribution taken together indicate a lack of evidence for SOA
formation under these conditions.
The high intensity experiments employed more far-UVC irradiance than required for
disinfection of a room the size of Room A. The increase in ozone of up to 10 ppb above background
during these experiments is consistent with the observations of Kalliomäki and coworkers, who

215
216
217

used 1.7-1.8 W cm-2 far-UVC in a poorly ventilated hotel quarantine facility room [36], and Peng
and coworkers, who used a similar level of far-UVC (2.0 W cm-2) in a small office with low
ventilation [27]. Steady state production of 8.6 ppb of O3 above baseline was also predicted by

218
219
220
221
222

simulations of Barber et al. for 5 W cm-2 in a room with 1 h-1 ACH, assuming an O3 deposition rate
of 3 h-1 [26]. Also consistent with our observations, Kalliomäki did not observe a clear correlation
between far-UVC use and submicron particle concentrations with SMPS measurements [36].
A mass balance for O3 in Room A can be written as follows:

That is, the rate of accumulation of O3 in Room A is equal to the transport of O3 in and out of
the room due to the ventilation, plus the O3 generation rate from the lamp(s), minus the loss rate
due to deposition or other reactive losses. At steady-state,

We can apply this analysis to hours 4-10 of the representative single lamp experiment shown
in Figure 1. We take the lounge concentration as [𝑂 , ] and use the measured ACH of 1.3 h-1
and 17 ppb as the Room A O3 level at steady state (Figure 1). There is some uncertainty in the
depositional loss rate kloss. Assuming kloss = 1 h-1, consistent with Peng et al. [27], suggests an

235

238
239
240

approximate ozone generation rate for the Lumenizer 300 of 764 g h-1. This is within the range
of observations for other GUV lamps in real-world settings [27,31]. We can calculate a minimum
kloss, which would correspond to zero ozone generation, of 0.19 h-1. Given the dimensions of Room
A, this corresponds to an ozone deposition velocity of 0.53 cm s-1, which falls within the range
reported for O3 deposition to carpeted surfaces [37].

Conclusion
We have observed the effects of far-UVC on indoor ozone and particulate matter under conditions
of real-world application in a small conference room with low ventilation. We find that a single
Lumenizer 300 far-UVC lamp, specified by the manufacturer to be sufficient for disinfection of the
space, does not result in significant net generation of O3 or PM under the conditions of our

experiment. Far-UVC may be a valuable component of a multilayer approach to reduce the risk of
transmission of respiratory viruses, used in combination with ventilation and other interventions
including air filtration, in furnished indoor environments. The smallest possible irradiance
necessary for disinfection should be used for the application in order to minimize ozone
generation and any possible effects on skin or eyes. Better ventilation (>3.0 h-1) than we observed
in Room A would further reduce steady state ozone buildup and is recommended for improved
indoor air quality in general [4].

S1. Data for ventilation characterization of Room A. CO2 tracer decay experiment was conducted
following McNeill et al. (2021). Two Aranet4 CO2 monitors were placed at opposite ends of the
room. CO2 (Airgas) was released into the room until the measured concentration of CO2 was 1000
ppm. The decay in CO2 reading was observed and ACH was derived using an exponential ﬁt to the
data (1.3 h-1).
