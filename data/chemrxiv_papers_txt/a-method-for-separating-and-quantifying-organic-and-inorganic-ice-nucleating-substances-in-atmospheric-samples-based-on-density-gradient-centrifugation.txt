ABSTRACT
Ice nucleating substances (INSs) influence the properties and frequencies of ice and mixed-phase clouds in the
atmosphere, and hence, climate and the hydrological cycle. INSs can be classified as inorganic (e.g., mineral dust,
volcanic ash) or organic (e.g., bacterial cells, cell-free proteins). While the properties of both INS classes have been
studied in the laboratory, the amounts in the atmosphere are still poorly constrained. Here, we demonstrate a new
method for separating and quantifying inorganic and organic INSs. First, INS suspensions were separated into a highdensity isolate containing inorganic INSs and a low-density isolate containing organic INSs using density gradient
centrifugation, and then INSs were quantified in each isolate using a droplet freezing technique. Inorganic K-feldspar
and organic Snomax INSs were used to test our method. The average K-feldspar INS recovery in the high-density
isolate was 54%, with no evidence of K-feldspar INSs in the low-density isolate. The average Snomax INS recovery
in the low-density isolate was 27%, with small amounts of Snomax contaminating the high-density isolate. A mixture
of K-feldspar and Snomax was successfully separated, with recoveries comparable to those observed for K-feldspar
and Snomax individually. Recoveries less than 100% can be explained by losses of INSs to vessel walls, accidental
mixing of the different density layers during pipetting, and incomplete collection of material during pipetting.

1. Introduction
In the atmosphere, ice can form homogeneously at temperatures ≲ -35 °C (Koop and Murray 2016).

Alternatively, ice can form heterogeneously in the atmosphere at temperatures > -35 °C when ice nucleation
is initiated by an ice nucleating substance (INS) (Hoose and Möhler 2012; Kanji et al. 2017; Murray et al.
2012). There are several different modes of heterogeneous ice nucleation including immersion freezing,
deposition nucleation, pore-condensation freezing, and contact freezing (David et al. 2019; Vali et al. 2015).
Immersion freezing, which is the focus of our study, occurs when freezing is initiated by an INS immersed
in an aqueous droplet and can dominate ice formation in mixed-phase clouds (Ansmann et al. 2009; Vali et
al. 2015; Westbrook and Illingworth 2013). INSs allow for the formation of ice crystals in clouds at warmer
temperatures and lower water vapor pressures than those required for homogenous ice nucleation. As a
result, INSs affect cloud properties and therefore the climate via effects on the hydrological cycle and
Earth’s radiative properties (Boucher et al. 2013; Lohmann 2002; Lohmann and Feichter 2005; Tan,
Storelvmo, and Zelinka 2016).

INSs can be divided into organic and inorganic substances. Inorganic INSs include mineral dusts, volcanic
ash, metals, and metal oxides, with mineral dust being a particularly prevalent class of inorganic INSs in
the atmosphere (Burrows et al. 2022; Kanji et al. 2017). Organic INSs include a wide range of materials
such as bacterial cells, fungal and pollen spores, cell-free biomolecules such as proteins or polysaccharides,
humic-like substances, secondary organic aerosols, and biomass burning aerosols (Burrows et al. 2022;
Dreischmeier et al. 2017; Kanji et al. 2017; Knopf, Alpert, and Wang 2018; Pummer et al. 2015). The
properties of both organic and inorganic INSs have been studied in the laboratory, but the absolute and
relative amount of organic and inorganic INSs in the atmosphere remains poorly constrained, leading to
uncertainties when predicting mixed-phase and ice clouds in the atmosphere. (Burrows et al. 2022;
Dreischmeier et al. 2017; Kanji et al. 2017; Knopf, Alpert, and Wang 2018; Pummer et al. 2015).

Several methods are available for quantifying the absolute and relative amounts of organic and inorganic
INSs in the atmosphere. One approach involves single-particle analysis combined with methods of isolating
INSs. Methods for analyzing isolated INSs include single-particle mass spectrometry (Burrows et al. 2022;
Corbin et al. 2012; Cziczo et al. 2004; DeMott et al. 2003; Pratt et al. 2009) and single-particle microscopy
(Burrows et al. 2022; Iwata and Matsuki 2018; Knopf et al. 2010; Knopf et al. 2022; Prenni et al. 2009).
Although these methods offer invaluable insights, they can suffer from poor sampling statistics and require
specialized operators and specialized and expensive equipment. As a result, these techniques are not
accessible to many laboratories.

Another class of techniques that can be used to quantify the absolute and relative amounts of organic and
inorganic INSs in atmospheric samples involves treating atmospheric samples with H2O2, heat, or
(NH4)2SO4 and observing the change in ice nucleating efficiency due to the treatment. H2O2 treatment is
used to remove organic material. H2O2 can be used to quantify organic and inorganic INSs in atmospheric
samples by measuring the concentration of INSs before and after H2O2 treatment with standard freezing
assays (Conen et al. 2011; Hill et al. 2016). Heat treatment has been used to denature heat-active proteins
(a type of organic INSs). Heat treatment can be used to quantify protein INSs in atmospheric samples by
measuring the concentration of INSs before and after heat treatment (Christner et al. 2008; Irish et al. 2019;
O’Sullivan et al. 2014; Schnell and Vali 1975; Wilson et al. 2015). (NH4)2SO4 treatment is used to enhance
the freezing properties of mineral dust (a type of inorganic INSs) (Kumar et al. 2018; Kumar, Marcolli, and
Peter 2019a; Kumar, Marcolli, and Peter 2019b; Whale et al. 2018; Worthy et al. 2021). The presence of
mineral dust INSs can be detected in atmospheric samples by measuring the concentration of INSs before
and after treatment with (NH4)2SO4 via a standard freezing assay (Worthy et al. 2021; Xi et al. 2022; Yun
et al. 2022). However, H2O2, heat, and (NH4)2SO4 treatments are susceptible to overestimating or
underestimating the contributions of INSs of interest as the treatments may affect INSs in the sample other
than the target INSs or may not affect all of the target INSs (Daily et al. 2022; Perkins et al. 2020). For the

aforementioned reasons, additional techniques are needed to better detect and quantify organic and
inorganic INSs.

One property of organic INSs that differs significantly from inorganic INSs is density (Table S1). Organic
INSs generally have densities of 1.6 g cm-3 or less (Anderson et al. 1966; Bakken and Olsen 1983; Bratbak
and Dundas 1984; Dinar, Mentel, and Rudich 2006; Durham 1943; Harding 1992; Harrington and Metzger
1963; Inoue et al. 2007; Neurohr, Amon, and Koch 2020; van Hout and Katz 2004), whereas inorganic
INSs have densities of 2.1 g cm-3 or greater (Anthony et al. 2001; Bagheri and Bonadonna 2016; Hazardous
Substances Data Bank (HSDB) 2023; National Center for Biotechnology Information 2023; Saxby et al.
2018; Vogel et al. 2017; Wintle 1997; Woor et al. 2022). Here, we present a new method for separating and
quantifying organic and inorganic INSs based on density gradient centrifugation, which takes advantage of
these differences. This method is straightforward and uses instruments that are available in many
laboratories. This method should also be compatible with INS samples collected using filters or impingers
(Schneider et al. 2021; Schrod et al. 2020). Additionally, this method does not suffer from sampling
statistics since many samples can be processed in a reasonable amount of time (Knopf and Alpert 2013).

Density gradient centrifugation is a well-established technique and has been previously used for a wide
variety of separations including the separation of organic particles from inorganic particles in soil, natural
waters, and pond sediments (Backman and Jansson 2004; Bakken 1985; Lammers 1963; Lindahl and
Bakken 1995). Nevertheless, the technique has not been used previously to separate or characterize INSs.

Below, we describe in detail our method for separating and quantifying organic and inorganic INSs via
density gradient centrifugation and a droplet freezing technique. We then present several experiments used
to test the efficacy of this approach. These experiments are aimed at answering several questions: 1) Does
the method introduce INSs into the low- and high-density isolates? 2) Does the density gradient medium
influence the freezing properties of the INSs? 3) What percentage of inorganic INSs can this method recover

in the high-density isolate and do any inorganic INSs contaminate the low-density isolate? 4) What
percentage of organic INSs can this method recover in the low-density isolate and do any organic INSs
contaminate the high-density isolate? This information will allow us to better assess the potential
performance and suitability of this method for use on atmospheric samples and identify any areas for
possible improvements. These experiments were carried out with potassium-rich feldspar as the test
inorganic INS and Snomax as the test organic INS.

2. Materials and methods
Our experimental method consists of first separating an INS suspension into a low-density fraction and
high-density fraction using density gradient centrifugation (Section 2.1). The low- and high-density
fractions are then washed via differential centrifugation to remove density gradient medium from the INSs
(Section 2.2). The concentration of INSs in the two isolates are then quantified with the droplet freezing
technique (Section 2.3).

2.1. Density gradient centrifugation

Density gradient centrifugation is a technique that involves separating material in a solution on the basis of
buoyant density. For our experiments, a sample of interest is layered on top of a medium of known density
(density gradient medium) and centrifuged. Any material present in the sample with a density greater than
that of the density gradient medium should migrate through the density gradient medium under the
centrifugal force, forming a pellet at the bottom of the experimental vessel, as long as sufficient
sedimentation time is provided. Any material less dense than the density gradient medium should not be
able to pass through the medium, no matter how long centrifugal force is applied. This separates the sample
into two fractions: one with material less dense than the density gradient medium, and one with material
more dense than the density gradient medium (Figure 1, steps 1-2).

Our density gradient centrifugation method was loosely based on the method developed by Lindahl and
Bakken (1995) for the separation of soil particles and soil bacteria. First, 5 mL of OptiPrep™ density
gradient medium (STEMCELL Technologies, Cat #07820) was placed in the bottom of a 15 mL centrifuge
tube. OptiPrep™ is a non-ionic, non-toxic to cells, isosmotic, and metabolically inert medium consisting of
60% w/v iodixanol (molecular weight = 1550 g/mol). OptiPrep™ has a density of 1.320 ± 0.001 g cm-3 as
specified by the manufacturer. Next, a 500 μL layer of ultrapure water was carefully placed on top of the
density gradient medium followed by 750 μL of INS suspension, taking great care to avoid any mixing
between layers (Figure 1, step 1). This water layer was placed between the density gradient medium and
the INS suspension to prevent mixing between the two when pipetting. Ultrapure water is defined herein as
distilled water purified by a Milllipore system to a resistivity of 18.2 M Ω cm at 25 °C. The tube was then
centrifuged at 3,214 × g for 2 hours in an Eppendorf S-4-104 swing-bucket rotor (Figure 1, step 2).
Calculations confirm that the centrifugal force and time used in our experiments should be sufficient for
inorganic particles of densities ≥ 2.5 g cm-3 and sizes of ≥ 0.23 μm to pass through the 5 mL OptiPrep™
cushion (see SI, Section 1, Table S2).

After centrifugation, the total volume of low-density material above the density gradient medium cushion
(~1250 μL) was collected via micropipette (Figure 1, step 3). The micropipette tip was held at the interface
of the low-density water and density gradient medium during pipetting since the majority of our organic
INSs should have collected at this interface. The density gradient medium cushion was then removed and
discarded, except for approximately 50-100 μL of density gradient medium at the bottom of the centrifuge
tube, which should contain any high-density material in the form of a pellet (Figure 1, step 3). This
remaining 50-100 μL density gradient medium and any high-density material was resuspended in 50 μL of
ultrapure water, transferred to a clean vessel, and then 1200 μL of ultrapure water were added to bring the
total volume to between 1300 and 1350 μL (Figure 1, step 4).

In the current experiments, we used K-feldspar and Snomax as test INSs. Considering our use of OptiPrep™
(density of 1.320 g cm-3) as the density gradient medium, we expect K-feldspar, which has a density of 2.55
– 2.63 g cm-3, to pass through the density gradient medium and form a pellet. We assume Snomax has a
buoyant density of approximately 1 – 1.2 g cm-3 based on the density of bacterial cells. As a result, Snomax
should not pass through the density gradient medium during density gradient centrifugation experiments.
If organic INSs with higher buoyant densities than 1.320 g cm-3 were centrifuged with OptiPrep™ these
INSs would pass through the density gradient medium. In that case, a density gradient medium with a higher
density should be used to separate the inorganic and organic INSs. However, a density gradient medium
with a higher density was not needed in the current experiments.

2.2. Washing step using differential centrifugation

After density gradient centrifugation, a differential centrifugation washing step was used to remove any
remaining density gradient medium from the high-density and low-density isolates (Figure 1, steps 5 – 7).
Differential centrifugation is a common technique for separating particles in aqueous solutions based on
sedimentation velocity. The high-density or low-density material resuspended in ultrapure water is
centrifuged for a prescribed amount of time, and the materials with sufficiently high sedimentation
velocities in water at the given centrifugal force will sediment to form a pellet at the bottom of the
centrifugation tube, while the rest of the material remains suspended in the water. Unlike density gradient
centrifugation, differential centrifugation does not involve the addition of any density gradient media, and
only involves sedimentation through the solvent (water). Here, samples were centrifuged (Beckman Coulter
Microfuge 20) for 10 minutes at 10,000 × g (Figure 1, step 5). Calculations illustrate that this centrifugation

force and time is sufficient for organic particles with sizes greater than ~0.3 μm and inorganic particles with
sizes greater than ~0.08 μm to pass through the water and sediment at the bottom of the tube (See SI, Section
S2, Table S3). After centrifugation, the water and any material that did not pellet at the bottom of the tube
(i.e. supernatant) was discarded, except the bottom ~5 μL which should contain the low- and high-density

INSs in the form of pellets. The remaining material was resuspended in 750 μL of ultrapure water. Because

the final volume was approximately equal to the initial volume of the INS suspension that was centrifuged,
the concentration of INSs in each isolate should be approximately equal to that of the low- or high-density
INSs in the unprocessed sample if no material is lost.

2.3. Droplet-freezing experiments

A droplet freezing technique similar to Whale et al. (2015) was used to determine the freezing temperature
spectrum of aqueous suspensions. We have previously used this technique to study the ice-nucleating
properties of inorganic, organic, and environmental INS samples (Irish et al. 2019; Worthy et al. 2021; Xi
et al. 2021; Yun et al. 2020; Yun et al. 2022). Hydrophobic glass slides (Hampton Research HR3-239) were
rinsed with ultrapure water, dried with nitrogen gas, and placed on a cold stage (Grant Asymptote EF600
cryocooler). A micropipette was used to place twenty 1 μL drops of sample onto each slide (Figure S1). A
second 1 μL drop of 0.01 M KNO3 solution was then added to each sample droplet, bringing the total
volume of each droplet to 2 μL, and the overall concentration of KNO3 in each droplet to 0.005 M. The 0.01
M KNO3 solution was prepared using ultrapure water. KNO3 was added to combat the effects of any loss
of K+ ions during the density gradient centrifugation on the freezing properties of K-feldspar (Yun et al.
2020). KNO3 was added to all samples for consistency. One slide of 20 droplets was prepared for each
sample. A chamber with a digital camera was placed over the cold stage to isolate the droplets from the
ambient air. A small flow of N2 gas was passed through the chamber to prevent condensation during
cooling. The cold stage temperature was decreased at a rate of 3 °C min-1 until all sample droplets were
frozen while the digital camera attached to the chamber recorded video of the freezing process. The freezing
temperature of each droplet was determined by processing the recorded video and cold stage temperature
data via a MATLAB script (Worthy et al. 2021; Xi et al. 2021). The cold stage temperature measurements
had an uncertainty of approximately ± 0.25 °C according to the manufacturer specifications. This
uncertainty was verified by measuring the melting points of water and dodecane and comparing the
measured values with literature values (Lide 2001). Because KNO3 was added to all droplets, all freezing

temperatures reported here were corrected for the freezing point depression (0.0186 °C) caused by the
solute. For details see SI Section S3.

The concentration of ice nucleating substances per liter of solution [𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)] (L-1) was calculated for each

sample using the following equation (Vali 1971):
[𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)] =

− ln(𝑁𝑁𝑢𝑢 (𝑇𝑇)⁄𝑁𝑁0 ) × 2
𝑉𝑉

(1)

Where 𝑁𝑁𝑢𝑢 (𝑇𝑇) is the number of droplets in an experiment that are unfrozen at temperature T, 𝑁𝑁0 is the total

number of droplets in an experiment, and V is the volume of an individual droplet. The factor of 2 was
included because the 1 μL drops of the INS suspensions were each diluted with an additional 1μL of KNO3.

2.4. INS suspensions

The inorganic INS K-feldspar and the organic INS Snomax were used as test materials to evaluate this
density gradient centrifugation method. Potassium-rich feldspar (K-feldspar) is an important component of
atmospheric mineral dust and an effective ice nucleus (Atkinson et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2016; Peckhaus
et al. 2016; Whale et al. 2018; Yun et al. 2020). The density of K-feldspar is in the range of 2.55 – 2.63 g
cm-3, based on heavy liquid density separation (Haldar and Tišljar 2014; Wintle 1997; Woor et al. 2022).
A K-feldspar sample was obtained from the Pacific Museum of Earth, University of British Columbia. The
K-feldspar was ground into a powder using a mortar and pestle. The mineralogy of the resulting powder
was 85% microcline (KAlSi3O8) and 15% albite (NaAlSi3O8) as determined by X-ray diffraction
measurements. The particle sizes were around 3 μm based on the specific surface area of the particles in
the powder determined with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller nitrogen adsorption method (Yun et al. 2020). A
0.1 wt% suspension of this powder was prepared in ultrapure water and stirred overnight before experiments
to ensure even particle distribution.

Snomax is a commercial snow inducer composed of freeze-dried P. syringae cells and cell fragments.
Bacterial cells, such as P. syringae, have densities in the range of 1.0 – 1.2 g /cm3 (Bakken and Olsen 1983;
Bratbak and Dundas 1984; Inoue et al. 2007; Neurohr, Amon, and Koch 2020), and we assume that Snomax
has a similar density. The particulate matter in Snomax is primarily between 600 and 2000 nm in diameter
(Wex et al. 2015). Snomax has been used previously to evaluate experimental methods for evaluating ice
nuclei and as a proxy for atmospheric biological INS (Koop and Zobrist 2009; Wex et al. 2015; Whale et
al. 2015; Worthy et al. 2021). A 1 × 10−4 wt% suspension of Snomax (Johnson Controls Snow) was

prepared in ultrapure water and stored at 4 °C.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Does the density gradient centrifugation technique introduce INSs?

Before testing our proposed density gradient centrifugation technique on INS suspensions, we tested the
density gradient centrifugation technique using ultrapure water to establish if the technique introduces INS
into the low- or high-density isolates. In these experiments, the high-density isolates overlap with the
ultrapure water controls, indicating that the density gradient centrifugation technique was not introducing
significant amounts of INS into the high-density isolates (Figure 2). The freezing curves of the low-density
isolates overlap with the ultrapure water controls at temperatures less than approximately -23 °C (Figure
2). At warmer temperatures, the INS concentrations in the low-density isolates were significantly higher
than in the ultrapure water controls in two of the three experiments. This suggests that some INSs were
being introduced into the low-density isolates at some point in some experiments. INSs could be introduced
from the lab air, the density gradient medium, materials used during density gradient centrifugation such as
centrifuge tubes or pipette tips, and materials used in droplet freezing assays such as hydrophobic glass
slides. Ultimately, the concentrations of INSs introduced are small and did not limit us from additional tests
of the density gradient centrifugation technique.

3.2. Do trace amounts of the density gradient medium impact the freezing properties of the INSs?

Although our technique includes a washing step to remove the density gradient medium (OptiPrep™), some
of the OptiPrep™ could still remain adsorbed to the INSs and influence their ice nucleation ability. To
determine if this may be important in our experiments, we measured the ice nucleation ability of both INSs
used in our experiments (K-feldspar and Snomax) in the presence of 1% OptiPrep™. This concentration is
most likely an upper limit to the concentrations expected after the washing step in our experiments based
on the amount of dilution in the washing steps. Corrections were made for the freezing point depression
caused by OptiPrep™ using Eq. S2. For a concentration of 1% v/v the calculated freezing point depression
was small (0.0036 °C).

In these experiments, the freezing curves of K-feldspar with 1% v/v OptiPrep™ overlap with those of Kfeldspar without OptiPrep™, indicating that OptiPrep™ does not have a significant impact on the freezing
properties of K-feldspar (Figure 3). The freezing curves for Snomax with 1% v/v OptiPrep™ also appear
to overlap with those of Snomax without OptiPrep™, but on average, appear to be shifted slightly to warmer
temperatures, suggesting that OptiPrep™ may slightly enhance the ice nucleation efficiency of Snomax.
Figure 3

To quantify if the INS concentrations were higher in the presence of 1% v/v OptiPrep™, we calculated the
percentage of ice nucleation activity from the unprocessed suspension that was “recovered” after the
addition of 1% v/v OptiPrep™ using the following equation:
[𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)]𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝

Where [𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)]𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 is the concentration of INSs in the INS suspension with 1% v/v OptiPrep™ at

temperature T and [𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)]𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 is the concentration of INSs in the corresponding unprocessed INS

suspension without OptiPrep™ at temperature T. The number of INS particles should not change in these
experiments, so this metric does not represent the recovery of physical INSs in this scenario.

For K-feldspar, the average recovery of ice nucleation activity in suspensions with 1% v/v OptiPrep™
added was 94% (median = 87%, 25th – 75th percentile = 51% to 116%) (Figure S2), further suggesting that
the freezing properties of K-feldspar were not impacted by the addition of 1% v/v OptiPrep™. For Snomax,
the average recovery of ice nucleation activity in suspensions with OptiPrep™ was 409% (median = 294%,
25th – 75th percentile = 206% to 520%). The recoveries suggest that the OptiPrep™ enhances the ice
nucleation efficiency of Snomax by a factor of approximately 2 to 5 (Figure S2). However, this increase in
INS concentration corresponds to just a 0.3 °C difference in median freezing temperatures between Snomax
suspensions with and without OptiPrep™, which is close to the uncertainty of our cold stage measurements
(±0.25 °C). In addition, the 1% v/v is an upper limit to the OptiPrep™ concentrations likely to be present
in the experimental isolates. As such, the observed enhancement of ice nucleation by Snomax in the
presence of 1% v/v OptiPrep™ is an upper limit to the effect of OptiPrep™ on Snomax ice nucleation in
our experiments.

3.3. Are INSs lost during the washing step?

Before evaluating the ability of our density gradient centrifugation method to isolate organic and inorganic
INSs, we investigated the differential centrifugation washing step alone (Figure 1, steps 5-7) to determine
if both the organic and inorganic INSs are effectively recovered during the washing process. The recoveries
from the washing step should serve as upper limits to the recoveries expected during density gradient
centrifugation. The INS concentrations in the supernatants, which are discarded during the density gradient
centrifugation protocol, were measured in addition to those in the pellet in order to discern if any INSs
remain in the supernatant.

Before discussing the results for the washing step, we first discuss the variability of the INS concentrations
for unprocessed K-feldspar and Snomax samples. The INS concentrations for K-feldspar, even for the
unprocessed samples, fluctuate by up to a factor of 20 from experiment to experiment (Figure 4 and Figure
S3). This variability is observed between replicates of the same K-feldspar solution performed on different
days and between replicates of the same K-feldspar solution performed on the same day. This corresponds
to median freezing temperature fluctuations of up to ~2.5 °C. This variability is likely due, at least in part,
to inhomogeneity in the K-feldspar suspensions, rather than the uncertainty in our temperature
measurements, which is small (±0.25 °C). INS concentrations for unprocessed Snomax samples also
fluctuate by up to a factor of 20 from experiment to experiment (Figure 4 and Figure S3). This corresponds
to median freezing temperature fluctuations of up to ~0.75 °C. This variability is also likely due, at least in
part, to inhomogeneity in Snomax suspensions, but may also be influenced by the uncertainty in our
temperature measurements (±0.25 °C). The variability for the unprocessed samples is important to keep in
mind when analyzing the data below.
Figure 4

Next, we discuss the results for the washing step (Figure 4). The freezing curves for the resuspended pellets
for both K-feldspar and Snomax overlap with the freezing curves for the unprocessed INS suspensions.
This indicates that a large fraction of both K-feldspar and Snomax INSs are being recovered in the washing
step. The K-feldspar supernatant contained significantly higher INS concentrations than the ultrapure water
control, but significantly lower INS concentrations than the K-feldspar pellet. On average, the K-feldspar
supernatant INS concentrations were ~15% of those of unprocessed K-feldspar. The Snomax supernatant
also contained significantly higher INS concentrations than ultrapure water, but only slightly lower INS
concentrations than the Snomax pellet. On average, the Snomax supernatant INS concentrations were ~30%
of those of unprocessed Snomax. Losses of INSs to the supernatant may occur if the centrifugal pellet is
disturbed during pipetting causing INSs to re-enter the supernatant. In addition, losses of INSs to the
supernatant may occur if there are K-feldspar and Snomax particles in our suspensions that are too small to

sediment effectively during the differential centrifugation process. Our calculations suggest that the
centrifugal force and time used during the washing step are sufficient for organic particles with sizes greater
than ~0.3 μm and inorganic particles with sizes greater than ~0.08 μm to sediment (See SI, Section S2,
Table S2). Therefore, if there are K-feldspar and Snomax particles present smaller than 0.08 µm and 0.3
µm, respectively, they may remain in the supernatant.

Percent recovery values were calculated using the following equation:
[𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)]𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝

(3)

Where [𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)]𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is the concentration of INSs in the resuspended pellet at temperature T and

[𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑇𝑇)]𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 is the concentration of INSs in the corresponding unprocessed INS suspension

without OptiPrep™ at temperature T.

For K-feldspar, the average % recovery in the centrifugal wash pellet was 159% (median = 100%, 25th –
75th percentile = 64% to 176%), indicating that the majority of the K-feldspar in the original suspension is
successfully collected after washing (Figure 5 and Figure S4). The % recovery values varied significantly
from experiment to experiment (see different symbol types in Figure S4). This variability can be explained,
at least in part, by inhomogeneity in the K-feldspar suspensions, which leads to variability from experiment
to experiment, even for unprocessed samples (see discussion above). In addition, the variability may be
partially explained by small variability in pipetting technique from experiment to experiment. Variability
in the pipetting technique could impact INS recovery by causing variability in how much of the centrifugal
pellet is disturbed and reenters the supernatant during supernatant collection.

For Snomax, the average % recovery in the centrifugal wash pellet was 98% (median = 85%, 25th – 75th
percentile = 56% to 120%), indicating that the majority of the Snomax in the original suspension is
successfully collected after washing (Figure 5 and Figure S4). Much like K-feldspar, the Snomax %

recovery varies significantly from experiment to experiment (see different symbol types in Figure S4). This
variability can also likely be explained, at least in part, by inhomogeneity in the Snomax suspensions. In
addition, slight variability in pipetting technique from experiment to experiment could also explain the
variability in the % recovery. Nevertheless, the majority of K-feldspar and Snomax INSs are recovered in
the pellet after washing via differential centrifugation.
Figure 5

3.4. Do all the K-feldspar INSs get recovered in the high-density isolate?

In order to determine the recovery of inorganic INSs in the high-density isolate and if inorganic INSs
contaminate the low-density isolate, tests were conducted with K-feldspar (density = 2.44 – 2.63 g cm-3),
an effective inorganic INS (Figure 6). For this case, the freezing curves for the high-density isolates partially
overlapped with the unprocessed samples, but on average were shifted to slightly colder (~1 °C)
temperatures indicating that most of the K-feldspar INSs were captured in the high-density isolate, but not
all. The freezing curves for the low-density isolates overlapped with the ultrapure water control, indicating
that the K-feldspar INSs were not contaminating the low-density isolates.
Figure 6

For the K-feldspar data, percent recovery values were calculated using Eq. 3 with the concentration of INSs
in the high-density isolate in place of the concentration of INSs in the wash pellet. K-feldspar INSs were
present in the high-density isolate with an average recovery of 54% (median = 49%, 25th – 75th percentile
= 15% - 87%) (Figure 5 and Figure S5). The recoveries varied significantly between experimental replicates
(see different symbol types in Figure S5). This variability can be explained, at least in part, by
inhomogeneity in the K-feldspar suspensions, which leads to variability from experiment to experiment
(see discussion above).

The % recovery values less than 100 % for K-feldspar INSs may be due to loss of K-feldspar to the vessel
walls during density gradient centrifugation. In addition, some of the K-feldspar INSs may have been
discarded with the density gradient medium if they were small in size and therefore not able to sediment
completely (See SI, Section 1, Table S1). K-feldspar loss could also occur if the pellet is disturbed when
removing the density gradient medium, leading to K-feldspar INSs reentering the density gradient medium
and being discarded.

Overall, the results of density gradient centrifugation performed on a K-feldspar suspension are consistent
with a large fraction of the K-feldspar INSs being isolated in the high-density isolate with minimal
contamination of the low-density isolate.

3.5. Do all the Snomax INSs get recovered in the low-density isolate?

In order to determine the recovery of organic INSs in the low-density isolate and if organic INSs
contaminate the high-density isolate using our proposed density gradient centrifugation method, tests were
conducted with Snomax (estimated density = 1.0 – 1.2 g cm-3), a highly effective organic INS (Figure 7).
The freezing curves for the low-density isolates were similar to the unprocessed samples, but shifted to
slightly colder (~1 °C) temperatures, indicating that a large fraction of the Snomax INSs were recovered in
the low-density isolate, but not all. For the high-density isolates, one of the freezing curves overlaps with
the ultrapure water blanks, but two of the freezing curves were shifted to warmer temperatures at low INS
concentrations. This suggests that the high-density isolate was contaminated by a relatively small
concentration of Snomax in some, but not all, experimental replicates.
Figure 7

In all cases, the concentrations of Snomax in the high-density isolates were less than 1% of those in the
unprocessed Snomax suspensions. The fact that contamination did not occur in all replicates suggests that
this contamination can be reduced or eliminated through careful experimental technique. If not all low-

density INSs are successfully collected when pipetting off the low-density material, some low-density INSs
may come into contact with micropipette tips used to collect the high-density material thereby
contaminating the high-density isolate.

Percent recovery values were calculated using Eq. 3 with the concentration of INSs in the low-density
isolate in place of the concentration of INSs in the wash pellet. Snomax INSs were present in the lowdensity isolate with an average recovery of 27% (median = 23%, 25th – 75th percentile = 17% - 34%) (Figure
5 and Figure S6). There was variability in recovery from experiment to experiment (see different symbol
types in Figure S6), which can likely be explained, at least in part, by inhomogeneity in the Snomax
solutions, which leads to variability from experiment to experiment, even within unprocessed suspensions.

The % recovery value less than 100 % for Snomax INSs may be explained by Snomax INSs sticking to
vessel walls or incomplete collection of the low-density fraction during pipetting. Snomax INSs will be
concentrated at the interface between the water layer and the density gradient medium after centrifugation.
Improper pipetting may lead to incomplete collection of the Snomax INSs. Pipetting can also lead to
mechanical mixing at the interface and some loss of the Snomax INSs into the density gradient medium.

3.6. For mixtures, what percentage of K-feldspar and Snomax INSs are recovered in the high-density and lowdensity isolates, respectively?

We evaluated the recoveries of inorganic and organic INSs in the high- and low-density isolates,
respectively, using a mixture of K-feldspar and Snomax INSs. This mixture was prepared by combining
the previously described K-feldspar and Snomax solutions in a 1:1 ratio. The freezing results for the mixture
were compared to unprocessed K-feldspar and Snomax suspensions, which were prepared by combining
the original K-feldspar and Snomax INS suspensions with ultrapure water in a 1:1 ratio (Figure 8). The
freezing curves for the high-density isolates were similar to those for unprocessed K-feldspar, but shifted
to slightly colder (~1 °C) temperatures, suggesting that a large fraction of the K-feldspar INSs, but not all,

were recovered in the high-density isolate. The freezing curves for the low-density isolates were similar to
those for unprocessed Snomax, but also shifted to slightly colder (~0.75 °C) temperatures, suggesting that
a large fraction of Snomax INSs, but not all, were recovered in the low-density isolate.
Figure 8

To determine recoveries, the INS concentrations in the high- and low-density isolates were compared to
unprocessed individual suspensions of K-feldspar and Snomax, respectively. K-feldspar INSs were present
in the high-density isolate with an average recovery of 56% (median = 49%, 25th – 75th percentile = 37% 65%) (Figure 5 and Figure S7). The % recovery of K-feldspar INS was similar to the % recovery of Kfeldspar INS in a suspension of just K-feldspar (Figure 5), suggesting that this density gradient
centrifugation technique is able to recover inorganic INSs in a mixture with a comparable efficiency to
inorganic INSs in a lone suspension.

Snomax INSs were present in the low-density isolate with an average recovery of 25% (median = 22%, 25th
– 75th percentile = 18% - 37%) (Figure 5 and Figure S7). The average % recovery of Snomax INS in the
mixture was equal to that of Snomax INS from a suspension of just Snomax (Figure 5), suggesting that this
density gradient centrifugation technique is able to recover organic INSs in a mixture with a comparable
efficiency to organic INSs in a lone suspension.

4. Conclusions
In this work we presented a method for separating and quantifying organic and inorganic INSs via density
gradient centrifugation combined with a droplet freezing technique. This method takes advantage of the
significant difference between the densities of organic INSs (≲ 1.6 g cm-3) and inorganic INSs (≳ 2.1 g cm3

). We characterized the performance of this method using K-rich feldspar and Snomax as test inorganic

and organic INSs, respectively. The main results from these studies are summarized in Figure 5. The

recovery of K-feldspar in the high-density isolate after density gradient centrifugation was on average 54%,
suggesting that many K-feldspar INSs, but not all, were successfully recovered. There was no evidence of
cross contamination of K-feldspar INSs in the low-density isolate. Similarly, the recovery of Snomax in the
low-density isolate was on average 27%, suggesting that many Snomax INSs, but not all, were successfully
recovered. In contrast, there was evidence of contamination of the high-density isolate with a small
concentration of Snomax INSs in two out of three experimental replicates. A mixture of K-feldspar and
Snomax was successfully separated, with recoveries of K-feldspar INSs in the high-density isolate and
Snomax INSs in the low-density isolate comparable to those observed for K-feldspar and Snomax
individually.

Recoveries less than 100% can most likely be explained by losses of INSs to vessel walls, accidental mixing
of the different density layers during pipetting, and incomplete collection of the high- and low-density
material during pipetting. Contamination of the high-density isolate by small amounts of Snomax INSs can
also likely be explained by incomplete collection of the low-density material, as this uncollected material
left in the centrifuge tubes can easily contaminate the high-density isolate. This highlights pipetting
technique and material collection as an area where improvements to the protocol would be beneficial.
Specialty devices, instruments, and protocols have been developed for layering and material collection in
density gradient centrifugation procedures (de Jonge 1979; Lawrence and Steward 2010; Work and Work
1978), which may help improve INS contamination and recoveries if integrated into our density gradient
centrifugation procedure. Nevertheless, recovery values less than 100% are acceptable as long as they are
quantified. The uncertainties associated with the concentrations of organic and inorganic INSs in the
atmosphere can be several orders of magnitude, or more (Burrows et al. 2022; Kanji et al. 2017); hence,
recoveries on the order of 30% or greater are acceptable, especially if they are known and can be accounted
for. Overall, our results suggest that this technique shows promise for separating, quantifying, and
characterizing inorganic and organic INSs. Additional studies are needed to determine if other types of
inorganic and organic INSs have similar recoveries to K-feldspar and Snomax, respectively. Before this

technique can be applied to atmospheric samples of unknown composition, we need to establish an
understanding of how this technique responds to a range of different INS types, sizes, and concentrations.

replicates. Ultrapure water controls correspond to the same ultrapure water used to resuspend the high- and lowdensity isolates. All freezing temperatures have been corrected for freezing point depression from added KNO3
(0.0186 °C).
