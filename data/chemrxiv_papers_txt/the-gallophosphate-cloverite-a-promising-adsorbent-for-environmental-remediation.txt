Abstract
Several recent molecular simulation studies proposed the gallophosphate zeotype cloverite,
or cloverite-type materials, as promising adsorbents for the removal of various contaminants
from water. This comment presents evidence that the cloverite models used in the simulations
presented in those articles were most likely not charge-neutral. Use of such physically
unrealistic adsorbent models is expected to have a negative impact on the meaningfulness of
the simulation results. To provide a potential starting point for future simulation studies, a
neutral model of guest-free cloverite is constructed and optimised with density functional theory
calculations.

Cloverite
The gallophosphate zeotype cloverite was reported by Estermann et al. in 1991.1 Its name is
derived from the shape of the apertures of the largest pores in the structure, as they resemble
four-leaf clovers. At the time of publication, these pore openings, which are lined by 20 TO4
tetrahedra (where T = tetrahedrally coordinated atoms, in this case, Ga and P), were the largest
reported for any zeotype structure (zeolite-like materials with pore openings constituted by up
to 30 TO4 tetrahedra have been reported more recently2). The largest cage of the cloverite
structure, which lies at the intersection of channels lined by the 20-membered rings (20MRs)
is also exceptionally large, with a body diagonal of ~30 √Ö. Another peculiarity of the cloverite
structure is the interrupted nature of the framework: In each 20MR, there are four TO4
tetrahedra having one ‚Äúdangling‚Äù O atom, which is not connected to a neighbouring T atom,

but forms a hydroxyl group that points towards the ring centre (Figure 1). As is the convention
for interrupted frameworks, the structure commission of the International Zeolite Association
(IZA) assigned a framework type code with a leading hyphen to the cloverite structure: -CLO.3
The crystal structure of cloverite, determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction
measurements, is cubic, space group ùêπùëö3ùëê, with a very large unit cell (a = 52.712 √Ö).1 While
the positions of framework atoms (including dangling O atoms) and fluoride anions
incorporated in the double four-membered rings (d4r units) could be refined, a refinement of
the positions of OSDA molecules and of hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups remained
elusive. This crystal structure is available from the IZA Structure Database (IZADB) in CIF
format.3 The content of the conventional cubic unit cell is Ga768P768O2976(O_OH)192F192, where
O_OH is used as a label to distinguish dangling oxygen atoms from those belonging to
Ga‚àíO‚àíP linkages. It has been postulated that the negative charge of ‚àí384 e per unit cell is
balanced by protons of hydroxyl groups and quinuclidinium cations in equal amounts
(192/192).4 Concurrent removal of OSDA cations and fluoride anions through calcination
results in a neutral compound with accessible porosity.5

Subsequent experimental investigations focused on various properties of cloverite, such as its
thermal stability and dehydration/defluorination behaviour,4,5 adsorption properties4,5,7 and its
potential use in gas-phase catalysis.8,9 Although the framework remains intact after calcination,
this detemplated form is unstable in the presence of water or other polar molecules,5,7 and can

only be stabilised by blocking the pores, for example, using silanes.10 The low stability of
cloverite (together with the rather high cost of gallium) severely limits its potential applicability
in separation and catalysis, despite the large pore openings. In 2010, an aluminophosphate
analogue of cloverite was reported.11 While it is more stable than the gallophosphate, the
calcined form still shows significant decrease in crystallinity upon exposure to ambient air for
several days. PKU-12, a germanosilicate having the -CLO topology, is also unstable in the
presence of water.12

Recent simulation studies of cloverite
In several recent simulation studies, grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were
employed to predict adsorption isotherms of organic or inorganic contaminants in different
zeolites.13‚Äì16 As high uptakes were predicted for cloverite in gallophosphate form or, in one
case, another -CLO-type structure, this framework was proposed as a particularly promising
system for contaminant removal in the context of environmental remediation. The following
studies are discussed in more detail in this comment:
o

In one paper, abbreviated SN2020 for convenience, the adsorption of three drug
molecules, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, and chloramphenicol, was investigated.13 The
conclusions of this paper state: ‚ÄúAccording to the molecular simulation results in this
research, CLO zeolite has proved to be the satisfactory zeolite suited for adsorption
of diclofenac, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol [‚Ä¶].‚Äù

o

More recently, a similar approach was used to study the adsorption of various
chlorinated hydrocarbons like hexachlorobenzene (HCB).16 In the abstract of this
paper, abbreviated JC2024, it is highlighted that ‚Äú[i]t was found that CLO (a cubic
microporous gallophosphate) demonstrated the highest adsorption capacity for HCB
among 245 zeolites, with a loading capacity of 65.84 wt%.‚Äù

o

Two computational investigations of ion adsorption addressed the adsorption of
metal cations like Pb2+ (CMS2021)14 and of inorganic anions like AsO43(JML2022).15 A representative quote from the conclusions of JML2022 reads:
‚ÄúAccording to the molecular simulation results, the CLO zeolite has proved to be the
best zeolite for adsorption of anions (PO43-, NO3-, CrO42-, AsO43-).‚Äù

While this comment addresses exclusively the modelling of the structure of cloverite, some
aspects of the simulation setup, such as the unclear relationship between fugacity and
concentration in the aqueous phase, have also been the subject of some scrutiny (see, for
example,

Non-neutral models of cloverite
In the first place, it may seem questionable whether a rather unstable and expensive zeotype
like the gallophosphate cloverite can play any role in large-scale applications, especially in the
view of its instability towards hydration. However, it would appear overly dogmatic to limit the
scope of computational screening investigations to those materials for which a practical
applicability has already been established, as the inclusion of less conventional materials may
result in new insights and potentially spark further experimental research. Hence, the main
point of criticism elaborated in this comment is not the fact that cloverite was included in the
investigations, but rather how it was modelled. Although neither of the four papers provides
input structures of the adsorbent models used in the simulations, the following issues can be
identified based on the information provided in text, figures, and tables:
o

In the abstract of SN2020, the composition of cloverite is stated as
F24Ga96P96O372(OH)24.13 Presence of 192 T atoms (Ga+P) indicates that this sum
formula refers to one eighth of the conventional cubic unit cell. A summation of the
formal charges indicates that this structure is not charge-balanced, with a total
charge of ‚àí24 e per formula unit (‚àí192 e per cubic cell). On the other hand, an
inspection of the figures of SN2020 (notably Figure 3 A and Figure S1) indicates that
neither the fluorine atoms nor the hydrogen atoms saturating the ‚Äúdangling‚Äù oxygen
atoms were present in the cloverite structure used in the simulations. This would
result in a sum formula Ga96P96O396, which also is not neutral (‚àí24 e per formula
unit). Incidentally, a cloverite model having this composition is included in the
structure database that is part of the commercial software DS BIOVIA Materials
Studio, which was used in the simulations reported in SN2020.

o

CMS2021 does not state a cell composition, but Figure S50 shows dangling,
unsaturated oxygen atoms and no fluorine atoms, rendering it plausible to assume
that a model with sum formula Ga96P96O396 was used, as in SN2020.14 The same
reasoning can be applied for the case of JC2024, notably on the basis of Figure 9.16

o

Although the sum formula is not given in JML2022, a density of 1.129 g cm-3 is stated
in Table S1.15 This is exactly the density of the purely siliceous model of the -CLO
framework that is included in the IZADB. This purely hypothetical all-silica -CLO
model has, again, dangling oxygen atoms and is therefore not neutral. As all T sites
are occupied by the same element, silicon, the structure can be described in a
smaller unit cell having composition Si192O396 (charge: ‚àí24 e).

Based on the evidence collected, it seems reasonable to surmise that all four investigations
used models of cloverite (or, in the case of JML2022, of a purely siliceous -CLO-type
framework) that were not charge-neutral. When simulating the adsorption of neutral, non-polar

guest molecules, it may be a permissible first approximation to ignore electrostatic interactions
altogether. In such cases, the non-neutrality of the adsorbent model and the presence of
dangling oxygen atoms may not cause any major artefacts. However, the adsorption of polar
molecules and, even more so, of cations or anions will be strongly impacted, if not dominated,
by electrostatic interactions. For such cases, use of charge-imbalanced adsorbent models is
expected to result in spurious electrostatic contributions to the total energy. In particular, the
dangling, undercoordinated oxygen atoms will act as negatively polarised sites that would
provide an artificially strong electrostatic interaction with cations or positively polarised areas
of guest molecules. Clearly, these spurious contributions will negatively affect the physical
meaningfulness of the simulation results and may result in qualitatively wrong predictions, for
example, by systematically favouring non-neutral adsorbents over neutral ones. Without going
into further details of the four studies, we may note that the reported loadings of 728 Pb2+
cations (positive excess charge: +2,184 e) or 420 phosphate anions (negative excess charge:
‚àí1,260 e) per conventional -CLO unit cell, taken from CMS2021 and JML2022, respectively,
appear physically unrealistic, especially when considering that, apparently, no additional
charge-balancing species were included in the simulations. In the commenter‚Äôs opinion, this
points to significant problems with the representation of electrostatic interactions, which may
not necessarily be caused, but certainly exacerbated by the use of non-neutral adsorbent
models.

A charge-balanced cloverite model
In order to obtain a charge-balanced model of the gallophosphate cloverite, the structure
refined by Estermann et al. was taken from the IZADB.1 The fluorine atoms occupying the d4r
units were removed, and all dangling oxygen atoms were saturated by hydrogen atoms. This
structure was then optimized using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, employing two different exchange-correlation functionals, namely, the PerdewBurke-Ernzerhof functional17 together with a Grimme-type D318 dispersion correction (PBE-D3)
and the rev-vdW-DF2 functional proposed by Hamada.19 Both of these approaches performed
well in a previous benchmarking study on all-silica zeolites and aluminophosphate zeotypes.20
Further details of the DFT calculations are provided in the Appendix.
Table 1 compares some important structure parameters of the DFT-optimised structures to
those of the experimental structure. The cell parameter a is 1.8%/1.0% (PBE-D3/rev-vdWDF2) larger than the experimental one. This tendency is unsurprising when considering, first,
that cell parameters of guest-free zeolites/zeotypes are often larger than those of assynthesised systems21 and, second, that a tendency to overestimate the cell parameters has
been established for both functionals (although it is less pronounced than for many other

dispersion-corrected DFT approaches).20 Regarding bond distances, it is noteworthy that the
average Ga‚àíO and P‚àíO bond distances in the DFT-optimised structures are about 0.04 √Ö
longer than in the experimental structure, regardless of the choice of functional. Nevertheless,
they fall well into the range of typical Ga‚àíO/P‚àíO bond distances compiled in a survey of
experimental zeolite and zeotype structures.22 Compared to bonds within Ga‚àíO‚àíP linkages,
bonds to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group are somewhat compressed for gallium, but
expanded for phosphorus. The O‚àíH distances amount to 0.971/0.974 √Ö (PBE-D3/rev-vdWDF2) for the (Ga‚àí)O‚àíH group and 0.974/0.977 √Ö for the (P‚àí)O‚àíH group. As the hydrogen
atoms were placed on a mirror plane in the starting structure in order to retain the ùêπùëö3ùëê
symmetry, it has to be conceded that the final, optimised positions are likely to depend on the
starting positions and may not correspond to global minima. However, it is not expected that
the exact orientation of the hydroxyl groups would strongly affect the properties computed
using such a DFT-optimised model, e.g., in adsorption simulations.

Concluding remarks
In summary, an analysis of the information provided in some earlier molecular simulation
studies points to a use of non-neutral models of cloverite in those works. It seems thus likely
that the results reported for polar or charged guest species are affected by spurious
electrostatic interactions. A neutral model of the gallophosphate cloverite was constructed and
optimised using dispersion-corrected DFT calculations; it should constitute a suitable starting
point for future molecular simulation studies of this material. An extension of the same
approach to -CLO-type structures with other compositions or other interrupted zeolite
frameworks should be straightforward. Looking beyond the specific case of cloverite, one feels
compelled to reiterate that care must be taken when using structural data from structure
databases for simulations of adsorption (or other) properties. Although significant efforts have
been made to develop ‚Äúcomputation-ready‚Äù structure databases, for example, in the field of
MOFs,23‚Äì25 even these may still contain structures that require modifications to allow for

physically meaningful simulations, with identified issues including missing hydrogen atoms or
charge-balancing ions.26,27 In general, crystal structure databases are not designed to provide
structures that are directly usable in simulations. It is therefore pivotal to include a ‚Äúsanity
check‚Äù, either by the user or via a suitably designed algorithm, prior to using structures from
such databases in any kind of molecular simulation. For the specific case of the IZADB, it can
be stated that the all-silica models of fully connected frameworks, optimised with a distance
least-squares algorithm (DLS-76), should not require further modifications, whereas models of
interrupted frameworks have to be treated with care. The same is true for the experimental
crystal structures contained in this database, which often contain disorder, for example, of
extra-framework cations or water molecules. Finally, it is recommended that researchers either
supply structures of adsorbent models or describe the origin of the initial models and, where
applicable, all modifications unambiguously and in sufficient detail in order to allow for a reliable
reproduction of the simulation results.

Appendix: Details of DFT calculations
The structure of cloverite as refined by Estermann et al.1 was taken from the IZA Database.3
Fluorine atoms were removed, and the two non-coordinated oxygen atoms (labelled O18 and
O19 according to the original publication, Figure 1) were saturated with hydrogen atoms.
These hydrogen atoms were put on the mirror plane perpendicular to a on which the O18 and
O19 atoms also reside (Wyckoff position 96i). The structure was then converted to the primitive
cell prior to full DFT optimisations using the CP2K code, version 2023.1.28 As described in the
main text, separate optimisations were performed using the PBE-D317,18 and rev-vdW-DF219
functionals. The DFT calculations used ‚Äúmolecularly optimised‚Äù double-zeta basis sets (DZVPMOLOPT-SR) proposed by VandeVondele and Hutter29 and Goedeker-Teter-Hutter
pseudopotentials devised by Krack,30 employing a cutoff energy of 600 Ry. Due to the size of
the unit cell, only the Œì point was included in the sampling of the first Brillouin zone. The
optimisations

the optimisations were considered converged when the maximal step size (displacement
between optimisation steps) was below 10-4 a0 (a0 = 0.52918 √Ö), the maximal residual force
was below 10-5 Hartree/a0, and the residual pressure was below 10 bar. The final structures
were converted back to the conventional cell setting using the DS Biovia Materials Studio suite.
