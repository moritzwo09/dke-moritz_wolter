Abstract

25

Distinct from other nontoxic PPD quinones, 6PPD-Q was recently discovered to be

26

regioselectively metabolized to alkyl hydroxylated metabolites (alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q) in rainbow

27

trout. It remains unknown whether the unique alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q might contribute to the toxicity

28

of 6PPD-Q. To test this, we herein synthesized chemical standards of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q isomers

29

and investigated their metabolic formation mechanism and toxicity. The predominant alkyl-OH-

30

6PPD-Q was confirmed to be hydroxylated on the C4 tertiary carbon (C4-OH-6PPD-Q). The

31

formation of C4-OH-6PPD-Q was only observed in microsomal, but not cytosolic fractions of

32

rainbow trout (O. mykiss) liver S9. A general CYP450 inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited the formation

33

of hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q, supporting that CYP450 catalyzed the hydroxylation.

34

This well-explained the compound- and regio-selective formation of C4-OH-6PPD-Q, due to the

35

weak C-H bond on the C4 tertiary carbon. Surprisingly, while cytotoxicity was observed for 6PPD-

36

Q and C3-OH-6PPD-Q in a coho salmon (O. kisutch) embryo (CSE-119) cell line, no toxicity was

37

observed for C4-OH-6PPD-Q. To further confirm this under physiologically relevant conditions,

38

we fractionated 6PPD-Q metabolites formed in the liver microsome of rainbow trout. Cytotoxicity

39

was observed for the fraction of 6PPD-Q, but not the fraction of C4-OH-6PPD-Q. In summary,

40

this study highlighted the C4 tertiary carbon as the key moiety for both metabolism and toxicity of

41

6PPD-Q, and confirmed that alkyl hydroxylation is a detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q.

Synopsis: The C4 tertiary carbon of 6PPD-Q is important for its unique metabolism and toxicity.

45

Alkyl hydroxylation by CYP450 seems to be a detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q.

Introduction
A recent milestone study identified the ozonation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-

48

phenyl-p-phenylenediamine

(6PPD),

N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-

49

quinone (6PPD-Q), as the toxicant responsible for the acute mortality of coho salmon (O. kisutch).1

50

6PPD-Q exerts extreme aquatic toxicity in coho salmon with a median lethal concentration (LC50)

51

of 95 ng/L.1,2 The discovery of this chemical has sparked a flurry of interest into 6PPD-Q from

52

both environmental chemists and toxicologists. One major discovery has been the high interspecies

53

variation in the toxicity of 6PPD-Q, as only members of the family Salmonidae appear to be

54

sensitive to 6PPD-Q, but even within the family there is a substantial variation across species.3–6

55

For instance, 6PPD-Q was found to be toxic to rainbow trout (O. mykiss) but not to arctic char (S.

56

alpinus),7 yet the toxicity mechanism has not been elucidated.

57

Recent studies from our group discovered the structurally selective toxicity of 6PPD-Q in

58

rainbow trout, while toxicity was not observed for other PPD-Qs with very similar structures.8

59

Correspondingly, a differential pattern in metabolism was observed across PPD-Qs in rainbow

60

trout, where the most abundant metabolite formed for 6PPD-Q was hydroxylated on the alkyl side

61

chain as opposed to the aromatic hydroxylation observed for the rest of the PPD-Qs. This alkyl

62

hydroxylated metabolite was detected at an even higher abundance than native 6PPD-Q in rainbow

63

trout fish tissue after 96 hours of exposure.9 The formation of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q was further

64

confirmed in additional studies on rainbow trout, humans, and other species.10–13 Bioactivation of

65

xenobiotics is a common mechanism to cause toxicity, as exemplified by the stronger toxicity of

66

hydroxylated metabolites compared to native polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).14–18 The unique

67

toxicity and regioselective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q prompted the hypothesis that alkyl-OH-

68

6PPD-Q rather than native 6PPD-Q might be the toxic species. Alternatively, alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q

69

might be a detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q (see hypotheses in Figure 1A). It would be of great

70

interest to examine the potential role of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q in mediating the toxicity of 6PPD-Q.

71

However, due to the lack of chemical standard, the identity or toxicity of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q has

72

not been examined.

73

In addition to toxicity, the enzymatic mechanism for the regioselective hydroxylation of

74

6PPD-Q on the alkyl side chain is also interesting. A recent study from the Brinkmann group

75

suggested that CYP1A might catalyze the hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout liver cells

76

(RTL-W1), by using human CYP450 isozyme-specific inhibitors.10 While this study provided

77

important evidence on the potential role of CYP450 enzymes, it has been well established that

78

CYP1A generally hydroxylates aromatic rings of xenobiotics.19–23 Thus, this may not explain the

79

chemical mechanism for the regioselective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q on the alkyl side chain. An

80

in-depth exploration of this mechanism is therefore important to understand the structure-related

81

metabolism and toxicity of PPD-Q compounds.

82

Given the interest surrounding the alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q in both the toxicity and metabolism

83

of 6PPD-Q, we endeavoured to 1) characterize the structure of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q with synthesized

84

chemical standards, 2) examine the formation of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q using S9 and subcellular

85

fractions of rainbow trout liver to understand the enzymatic mechanism, and 3) assess the in vitro

86

toxicity of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q using the coho salmon embryo (CSE-119) cell line. This is the first

87

study to systematically characterize the structure, metabolism, and toxicity of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q,

88

which is crucial to understand the toxicity mechanism of 6PPD-Q.

Materials and Methods

93

Chemicals and Reagents. All chemical reagents were purchased from commercial vendors and

94

used without further purification, unless otherwise specified. All reactions necessitating oxygen-

95

or moisture-free conditions were conducted using oven-dried glassware under a nitrogen

96

atmosphere. Reagent-grade solvents were used for all chemical reactions. HPLC-grade methanol

97

and acetonitrile were purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ, United States). 6PPD-Q

98

and d5-6PPD-Q chemical standards were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North

99

York, ON, Canada). The fluoxetine chemical standard and NADPH tetrasodium salt (98 %) were

100

purchased from Sigma (Oakville, ON, Canada). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) tablets were

101

purchased from Froggabio (Concord, ON, Canada). Sodium cholate (SC), digitonin (Dig), and n-

102

dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) detergents were purchased from Sigma (Oakville, ON, Canada).

103

2-amino-4-methylpentan-3-ol was purchased from Enamine (Monmouth Junction, NJ, United

104

States).

105

Synthesis of Hydroxylated 6PPD-Qs. The synthesis of two alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q isomers was the

106

primary synthetic focus of this work. The two isomers will henceforth be referred to as the C3-

107

alkyl-OH-6PPDQ and C4-alkyl-OH-6PPDQ metabolites. The synthesis of the C3-alkyl-OH-

108

6PPDQ was achieved in 1 step via the adaptation of a previously reported synthetic protocol24 and

109

the use of the purchased α-amino alcohol, 2-amino-4-methylpentan-3-ol, to yield the desired

110

compound, albeit at a poor yield (13%). The synthesis of the C4-alkyl-OH-6PPDQ was completed

111

in 3 steps, starting from the commercially available diacetone alcohol to prepare the β-amino

112

alcohol, and then the subsequent substitution of mono-aniline substituted paraquinone to yield the

113

second isomer. Both compounds necessitated the use of reverse phase (RP) – flash

114

chromatography to purify. The purity of each chemical standard was confirmed via proton nuclear

115

magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and carbon-13 NMR (13C-NMR) conducted on an Agilent DD2

116

500 MHz spectrometer with comparison to an internal standard (mesitylene). Purity was further

117

validated by LC-HRMS analysis. Detailed synthetic procedures were provided in the Supporting

118

Information.

119

Fish Tissue Collection and Preparation. Two each of rainbow trout and arctic char were kindly

120

gifted by Ryan Hill and Mark Newell from the Centre for Innovative Aquaculture Production

121

(Fleming College, Lindsay, ON, Canada) hatchery. All fish were sexually mature females

122

weighing approximately 800 g. Fish were kept alive in oxygenated plastic bags during transport

123

and were then anesthetized and dissected on ice immediately to avoid loss of enzyme activity, as

124

per guidelines from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Test No.

125

319B.25 The whole organs of each fish were excised with sterile stainless steel surgical scissors,

126

transferred to Eppendorf tubes, flash-frozen on dry ice, and then stored immediately at -80 °C until

127

further preparation.

128

S9 was prepared from various tissues (i.e., liver, brain, gill, intestine) of both species via an adapted

129

version of the OECD Test No. 319b guidelines.25 Tissue was thawed on ice before being rinsed

130

with ice cold phosphate buffer [0.08 M sodium phosphate, 0.02 M potassium phosphate; pH =

131

7.4]. Excess fluid was removed, and the tissue was minced with sterile stainless steel surgical

132

scissors on ice. Approximately 0.2 g of tissue was transferred to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube, suspended

133

in 800 µL ice cold phosphate buffer (4 mLbuffer/gtissue), and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Fisher

134

Scientific Powergen 125 (FTH-115) blade-type homogenizer on ice. Multiple replicates were

135

prepared. Following this, the tissue was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the

136

supernatant (tissue S9) was transferred to a new tube and stored at -80 °C until further preparation

137

or use. To prepare microsomal or cytosolic sub-cellular fractions from the liver S9, we used an

138

adapted version of Dyer’s method.26,27 In brief, 800 µL of tissue S9 was transferred to an

139

ultracentrifuge tube and suspended in 14.2 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffer. The S9 was

140

ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was

141

transferred to new tubes and stored at -80 °C until use. The pellet (microsome fraction) was then

142

re-suspended in 2 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffer and stored at -80 °C until use. The total protein

143

concentration of tissue S9, microsome, and cytosol fractions were determined by Bradford protein

144

assay.

145

Fish S9, Microsome, and Cytosol Metabolism Experiments. For in vitro incubations of rainbow

146

trout or arctic char S9, microsome, or cytosol, the reactions were performed in 0.05 M sodium

147

phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in the dark, using an adapted version of OECD Test No. 319B.25 The

148

reaction mixtures (250 μL) consisting of ~ 10 µL S9/microsome/cytosol (final reaction

149

concentration = 0.15 µg/µL protein), 12 μL of a 10.5 mM NADPH stock solution, and 5 μL of a 5

150

mg/L 6PPD-Q stock solution and were incubated in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Incubations were

151

carried out in triplicate in separate tubes at 20 °C to mimic physiological conditions, and 200 μL

152

of ice-cold acetonitrile was added into each vial to terminate the reaction. Initially, the reaction

153

was terminated after 0, 1, 5, and 24 h. It was then determined that sufficient metabolite was formed

154

after 5 h (Figure S1), and therefore all subsequent reactions were performed for 5 h. Prior to

155

instrument analysis, the reaction extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g, and 45 µL of

156

each extract was transferred to an LC vial with 5 µL of 100 µg/L of d5-6PPD-Q internal standard

157

and vortexed to mix.

158

Metabolite Fractionation by HPLC. An incubation of rainbow trout microsome with 6PPD-Q

159

was carried out using the conditions described above with minor modifications to increase the

160

quantity of metabolite products. Namely, the reaction concentration of protein was increased to

161

0.5 mg/mL, and the concentration of 6PPD-Q in the reaction media was increased to 1 mg/L. The

162

final extract was fractionated with an Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC (Agilent Technologies) with

163

an C18 column (Accucore Vanquish, 50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.5 μm; Thermo Scientific). Twenty

164

microliters of extract was loaded onto the column. HPLC grade water with 1 % formic acid and

165

and methanol with 1 % formic acid were used as mobile phases A and B, respectively, with a flow

166

rate of 0.5 mL/min. The LC method was as follows: B was kept static at 5% from 0 to 2 min,

167

increased to 100% from 2 to 11 min, kept static at 100% from 11 to 15 min, then returned to 5%

168

from 15 to 16 min, and maintained at 5% until 20 min. The signal intensity was measured at 280

169

nm and 350 nm. Twenty fractions were collected at a time interval of 1 min from 1 to 20 min in

170

microcentrifuge tubes. Fractions were dried by vacuum concentration (Savant SpeedVac; Thermo

171

Scientific) and reconstituted in 50 μL of methanol.

172

Cell Culture and Toxicity Testing. Coho salmon embryo cells (CSE-119) were incubated at 20

173

ºC in culture media [Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

174

(Peak Serum, Inc.) and 10% penicillin-streptomycin (Cytiva HyClone)].28 Toxicity was evaluated

175

using alamarBlue or neutral red cell viability assays.28,29 For the alamarBlue assay, resazurin

176

sodium salt was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 0.30 mg/mL,

177

which was passed through a sterilizing filter (0.22 μm) and stored at -20 °C in darkness until use.

178

For the neutral red assay, a stock solution of neutral red dye was prepared in PBS at a concentration

179

of 4 mg/mL and stored at room temperature in the dark. One day prior to use, neutral red media

180

was prepared at a concentration of 40 µg/mL in culture media, incubated at 20 ºC overnight with

181

shaking, and centrifuged at 10,000 g prior to cell dosing to remove any undissolved dye crystals.

182

24 hours before cell exposure, CSE-119 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with a density of

183

10,000 cells/well in 100 μL of culture media. Exposure media was prepared fresh by dissolving

184

stock solutions of 6PPD-Q chemical standard or synthesized OH-6PPD-Qs (in acetonitrile) in fresh

185

culture media. Culture media in 96-well plates was replaced with 100 μL of seven 3-fold serial

186

diluted exposure media (0.34 to 250 μg/L). The percentage of acetonitrile in the culture media was

187

less than 0.2 %, and acetonitrile at this percentage did not influence cell viability. For toxicity

188

testing of metabolites extracted from fish liver microsome, both pre- and post-HPLC fractionation,

189

the percentage of acetonitrile in the culture media was less than 1 %, which did not influence cell

190

viability. There were 4 replicates for each concentration. For the alamarBlue assay, after 48 hours

191

of exposure at 20 °C, 10 μL of cell viability reagent was added to each well in a dark room, then

192

the cells were incubated for 4 h at 20°C in darkness. After that, fluorescence was recorded with

193

excitation at 550 nm and emission at 600 nm by a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro M Plex microplate reader

194

(Tecan Life Sciences, Switzerland). Cell viability was calculated as the measured fluorescence

195

value at each well compared with that of the solvent control from the same plate. For the neutral

196

red assay, after 48 hours of exposure at 20 °C, exposure media was removed from the cells and

197

100 µL of neutral red media was added to each well. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 20°C in

198

darkness to allow for dye uptake via the lysosomes of viable cells, and then the neutral red media

199

was removed. Following this, the cells were washed with 150 µL PBS per well, and 150 µL

200

destaining solution (50 % ethanol, 49 % deionized water, 1 % glacial acetic acid) was added per

201

well. The 96-well plate was shaken rapidly in a microtiter plate shaker for 10 minutes to form a

202

homogenous solution in each well. After that, the optical density of each well was recorded by a

203

Tecan Infinite 200 Pro M Plex microplate reader at 540 nm. Cell viability, expressed as a

204

percentage of solvent controls, was then calculated.

205

LC-Orbitrap Analysis of Small Molecules. Chemical analysis was conducted with a Q-Exactive

206

mass spectrometer equipped with a Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

207

Separation was achieved with a C18 column (Accucore Vanquish, 50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.5 μm;

208

Thermo Scientific). The injection volume was 2 μL, with 1% formic acid in ultrapure water (A)

209

and 1% formic acid in methanol (B) as the mobile phases. Initially, 5 % B was increased to 50 %

210

from 0 to 2 min, then increased to 100 % at 6 min and held static for 7.5 min, followed by a

211

decrease to initial conditions of 5 % B for 0.5 min, which was held for 1 min to allow for

212

equilibration. The flow rate was 0.15 mL/min. The column and sample compartment temperatures

213

were maintained at 40 and 4 °C, respectively. Data were acquired in full scan MS 1 and data-

214

independent acquisition (DIA) MS2 modes. Parameters for full scan MS1 (100–900 m/z) switch

215

mode were as follows: recorded at resolution R = 70 000 (at m/z 200) with a maximum of 3 × 106

216

ions collected within 100 ms. In both negative and positive modes, two DIA tandem MS (MS/MS)

217

scans were established by covering the m/z ranges of 100 to 500 and 500 to 900, respectively. The

218

DIA scan had an isolation window of 20 m/z. Mass spectrometric settings for both ESI (−) and ESI

219

(+) modes were as follows: spray voltage of 3.0 kV; sheath gas flow rate of 30 L/h; auxiliary gas

220

flow rate of 6 L/h; capillary temperature of 300 °C.

221

Shotgun Proteomics. Shotgun proteomics was used to profile the CYP450 enzymes across RT

222

liver, brain, intestine, and gill tissue S9. The proteomics sample preparation was performed as

223

outlined in previous studies.30,31 S9 was digested with trypsin and the peptides were injected into

224

an EASY-nanoLC 1200 UHPLC, operated under electrospray ionization, paired with a Q-Exactive

225

H-X Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were

226

separated on an in-house packed C18 column (10 cm × 75 µm internal diameter, packed with 3 µm

227

Luna C18 100 Å reverse phase beads (Phenomemex; Torrance, CA, USA)). The nanoLC mobile

228

phases were A) 0.1 % formic acid in water, and B) 0.1 % formic acid in 80:20 acetonitrile:water.

229

B was increased from 2 to 5 % for 1 min, gradually increased to 26 % for 89 min, increased to 100

230

% at 105 min, and held at 100 % for 15 min. The flow rate 300 nL min-1.

231

Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was used to detect the top 20 peptides. Full MS scan

232

parameters were as follows: m/z range of 350 – 1400, resolution of 60,000 at m/z =200, AGC of 3

233

× 106. MS2 scans held precursor ions 1.4 m/z windows and were accumulated for 20 ms or until

234

the AGC target was reached.

235

Quality Assurance and Quality Control. For each batch of metabolism experiments, one blank

236

sample and two forms of negative control were included. The blank was prepared as described

237

above but without 6PPD-Q, which was replaced with an equivalent volume of buffer. Heat-

238

inactivated S9 (heated at 100 ºC for 10 min) of rainbow trout or arctic char was used as a negative

239

control.25 An additional negative control with S9, microsome, or cytosol, but without NADPH,

240

was also used. Triplicate experiments were performed for each treatment group to ensure the

241

reproducibility and consistency of the potential metabolites. For the instrumental analyses,

242

procedural blanks were incorporated with each batch of samples to monitor for potential

243

background contamination. Injections of 6PPD-Q chemical standard were performed following

244

every 10 sample injections to monitor for instrument stability, followed by an injection of MeOH

245

to monitor for potential carryover. Quantification of 6PPD-Q and semi-quantification of

246

metabolites was determined using the relative response against the d5-6PPD-Q internal standard

247

using calibration curves of 6PPD-Q. The recovery of 6PPD-Q in the metabolism incubation

248

experiments at 5 hr was 98 ± 8 %. The method detection limit (MDL) of 6PPD-Q was calculated

249

by a 99 % confidence level of y-intercept divided by the slope of the calibration curve and was 2.2

250

– 3.0 µg L-1 for the metabolism experiments. Proteomics cross-tissue experiments were performed

251

in triplicate.

Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All dose-response curves were fit using the nonlinear regression

254

of log-transformed data via GraphPad Prism, and half-maximal effect concentration (EC50) values

255

were determined using the fitted curves. Raw proteomics data were analyzed using MaxQuant

256

(version 2.4.10) and default parameters were used with a false discovery rate of 1 % with a list of

257

common contaminants. The rainbow trout proteome was obtained from Uniprot and used to match

258

extracted MS2 spectra. Proteomics data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. In cases where a

259

peptide was below the limit of detection in one or two out of three replicates, it was assigned an

260

intensity value of 1.5E04, which corresponded to the intensity of the lowest intensity peptide

261

detected in the dataset divided by two. Raw MS files and their resulting MaxQuant output tables

262

have been uploaded to the MassIVE repository and ProteomeXchange (MSV000096218).

Results and Discussion

268

Synthesis and structure confirmation of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q. While we previously identified an

269

alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite in rainbow trout fish tissue after exposure to 6PPD-Q, we could not

270

discern the exact position of hydroxylation on the alkyl side chain.8 Upon inspection of the MS2

271

spectrum of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q, two characteristic MS2 fragments of 241.0969 and 257.1284

272

suggested that the hydroxyl group was likely located at the C3 or C4 carbon position (Figure S2A).

273

We therefore elected to focus on the synthesis of the C3- and C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q isomers

274

individually to confirm the position of hydroxylation. We started by synthesizing the C3-alkyl-

275

OH-6PPD-Q isomer, largely because its starting material (the α-amino-alcohol 2-amino-4-

276

methylpentan-3-ol) was commercially available. The synthesis was achieved in a single step via

277

the substitution of 2-anilino-1,4-benzoquinone with 2-amino-4-methylpentan-3-ol (Figure 1B).

278

Further details of the synthesis were described in Text S1. The identity and purity (> 90%) of the

279

synthesized C3-OH-6PPD-Q was characterized by LC-MS, NMR (Figures S3 – S5), and IR (Figure

280

S6). However, when compared to the major alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q formed in rainbow trout fish tissues

281

(retention time = 4.70 min), the retention time of the synthesized C3-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q (4.93 min)

282

did not match (Figure 1C). The MS2 spectrum of the synthesized standard further confirmed that

283

C3-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q was not the major alkyl metabolite formed in rainbow trout as it did not

284

possess diagnostic fragments at m/z 257.1283 and 241.0971 (Figure S2C). Instead, the C3-OH-

285

6PPD-Q standard possessed a unique fragment at m/z 243.1128, which corresponded to a minor

286

alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite identified in the fish tissue extract that also elutes at 4.93 min. Due

287

to the low concentration of this metabolite, we proceeded to focus on the predominant alkyl-OH-

288

6PPD-Q metabolite at 4.70 min.

of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q in 3 steps, and similarly characterized its identity and purity (> 90%) with

299

LC-MS, NMR (Figures S7-9), and IR (Figure S10). Comparison of the LC trace of synthesized

300

C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q with a tissue extract of 6PPD-Q-exposed rainbow trout revealed a common

301

retention time (4.71 min; Figure 1B). Moreover, their MS2 spectra contained common diagnostic

302

fragments at m/z 241.0969 and 257.1284 (Figure S2A and S2D). Collectively, by using two

303

synthesized chemical standards, we confirmed the predominant alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q formed in

304

rainbow trout fish tissue as C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q.

305

Enzymatic mechanism for the regioselective formation of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q. After the

306

confirmation of hydroxylation on the C4 carbon, we proceeded to investigate the enzymatic

307

mechanism for the regioselective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q. To achieve this, we used liver S9 of

308

rainbow trout as an in vitro model.25,32–34 After the incubation of 6PPD-Q with liver S9 for 5 hours,

309

C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q (retention time = 5.47 min) and aryl-OH-6PPD-Q (retention time = 6.02

310

min) were clearly detected (Figure 2A; MS2 in Figure S2B). Similar formation of OH-6PPD-Qs

311

was not observed in negative controls wherein liver S9 was heated deactivated. Additionally, the

312

formation of OH-6PPD-Qs was not observed in the absence of NADPH, demonstrating that

313

NADPH was an essential cofactor for the enzymatic reactions.

Starting from the commercially available diacetone alcohol, we were able to achieve the synthesis

Figure 2. (A) C4-alkyl- and aryl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolites were produced via incubation of 6PPDQ in rainbow trout liver S9, but not in heat deactivated liver S9, or in the absence of NADPH
(NADPH (-)). (B) C4-alkyl- and aryl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolites were produced via incubation of
6PPD-Q in rainbow trout liver microsome, but not in liver cytosol. C) The production of the C4alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite was significantly inhibited by the introduction of 100 µM of the
general CYP450 inhibitor fluoxetine (Flu) to rainbow trout liver microsomal incubation media.

322

We further isolated the microsomal and cytosolic fractions from liver S9 by using

323

ultracentrifugation to examine the subcellular location of the catalytic enzymes. As shown in

324

Figure 2B, formation of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q and aryl-OH-6PPD-Q was observed in the

325

microsomal fraction but not in the cytosolic fraction. The exclusive formation of OH-6PPD-Qs in

326

the liver microsome indicated that the enzymes catalyzing the hydroxylation may belong to the

327

CYP450 family, as it is well-known that CYP450 enzymes are located in microsome and catalyze

328

the hydroxylation of xenobiotics.35 To further confirm this, we co-incubated 6PPD-Q in

329

microsome with fluoxetine (Flu; see structure in Figure 2), which has been benchmarked as a

330

general CYP450 inhibitor in rainbow trout.36 The co-incubation of 6PPD-Q with 100 µM of

331

fluoxetine in liver microsome significantly inhibited the production of the C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q

332

metabolite by 66 ± 8 % (p = 0.002), while the production of the aryl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite also

333

appeared to be minorly inhibited (~23 %) albeit not to a statistically significant extent (Figure 2C).

334

The more efficient inhibition of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q by fluoxetine demonstrated that the two

335

metabolites might be catalyzed by different CYP450 isozymes. The confirmation of CYP450 as

336

the catalytic enzyme of 6PPD-Q hydroxylation was consistent with a recent study from the

337

Brinkmann group which reported the decreased biotransformation of 6PPD-Q in a rainbow trout

338

liver cell line (RTL-W1) upon co-incubation with certain CYP450 inhibitors.10

339

After confirmation of the role of CYP450, we then proceeded to identify the isozyme among the

340

~35 isozymes annotated in rainbow trout.37 While the co-incubation of substrates with isozyme-

341

specific CYP450 inhibitors has been widely used as an approach to pinpoint key isozymes in

342

mammals such as humans, such an approach is infeasible in fish species (i.e., rainbow trout) as

343

they do not possess the same isozyme specificity.38 We initially attempted to purify the CYP450

344

isozyme from the crude liver microsome of rainbow trout using size-exclusion chromatography,

345

which required the solubilization of membrane-bound CYP450 enzymes with detergents, as

346

reported in previous studies.39–42 Unfortunately, despite months of effort, this biochemical strategy

347

was unsuccessful as 80 – 99 % of enzyme activity was lost among the 5 different detergent

348

conditions we selected based on previous CYP450 enzyme studies (Table S1, Figure S11).39–42

349

We then employed a completely different approach using shotgun proteomics since the genome

350

sequence of rainbow trout has been well-defined.37 To achieve this, we first incubated 6PPD-Q

351

with S9 prepared from four different tissues including liver, brain, intestine, and gill. Not

352

surprisingly, the highest formation of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q and aryl-OH-6PPD-Q was detected

353

from liver S9, while minor or no formation was observed in S9 from other tissues (Figure 3A).

354

This clearly demonstrated that the catalytic CYP450 isozyme was tissue-specifically expressed in

355

liver. We then used shotgun proteomics to profile the tissue distribution of CYP450 isozymes.

356

Across all four tissues, peptides associated with a total of 10 CYP450 isozymes were detected

357

(CYP27A1, 2F2, 2F3, 2J2, 2K1, 2M1, 3A27, 3A30, 4B1, and 4V2; Figure 3B). The absence of

358

CYP1A isozymes at a significant level was consistent with a previous study on the closely related

359

salmonid species coho salmon (O. kisutch) wherein isozymes CYP450 2K1, 2M1, and 3A27 were

360

found to be much more highly expressed in liver than CYP1A1.43 These results did not align with

361

a recent study suggesting CYP1A as the primary catalyzing enzyme of 6PPD-Q hydroxylation.10

362

In that study, human CYP1A-specific inhibitors α-naphthoflavone (ANF) and quercitin were used,

363

but these two inhibitors have been reported as non-specific towards CYP1A in rainbow trout.44–46

364

Thus, CYP1A may not be the isozymes responsible for 6PPD-Q hydroxylation in rainbow trout.

371

Notably, distinct expression profiles of CYP450 isozymes were observed across tissues, with 10

372

detected in liver, 10 in brain, 7 in intestine, and 2 in gills. This provided an opportunity to correlate

373

tissue-specific expression of CYP450 isozymes to the tissue-specific metabolic formation of OH-

374

6PPD-Qs. For example, CYP2F3 was detected at comparable abundances across liver, brain and

375

intestine and should thus be excluded as a possible candidate. On the other hand, CYP2K1 was

376

detected in liver >> brain >> intestine and was not detected in the gills, which was highly correlated

377

with the tissue-specific metabolic formation of OH-6PPD-Qs (Figure 3B). By using this strategy,

378

CYP2F2, 2J2, 2K1, and 3A27 were identified as possible candidate isozymes responsible for the

379

hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q. Indeed, in contrast to CYP1A enzymes which have been well-

380

established to hydroxylate the aromatic rings of xenobiotics (e.g., PAHs) in fish,39,47–49 CYP2K1

381

from rainbow trout has been reported to regioselectively hydroxylate lauric acid on the (ω-1)-OH

382

position of its alkyl chain.50 Further studies are warranted to confirm the exact isozymes that are

383

responsible.

384

Collectively, we herein demonstrated that the hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q in rainbow trout is

385

catalyzed by CYP450 enzymes. With this information, the selective hydroxylation of the C4

386

carbon on the alkyl side chain of 6PPD-Q became apparent. It has been well established that

387

CYP450 hydroxylation proceeds via the radical mechanism that is colloquially known as “oxygen

388

rebound” where the Fe(IV) oxo complex first abstracts a hydrogen atom to produce a carbon-

389

centered radical (Figure 3C).51–53 The H-abstraction is the first and rate-limiting step for CYP450

390

catalyzed hydroxylation. Note that bond dissociation energy (BDE) of a tertiary carbon, (BDE =

391

403 kJ/mol), is significantly smaller than those of secondary (BDE = 412 kJ/mol) and primary

392

carbon (BDE = 423 kJ/mol).54 At room temperature, a marginal difference of ~5 kJ/mol can

393

correspond to a rate that is 1,000 to 10,000 times different.55,56 Moreover, this catalytic mechanism

394

also accounts for the compound-selective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q on the alkyl side chain

395

compared to other previously studied PPD-Qs, as 6PPD-Q is the only analogue with a tertiary

396

carbon possessing only alkyl substituents. In contrast, while other PPD-Qs possess tertiary carbons,

397

they are substituted by secondary amino groups. Upon hydroxylation, they will form the unstable

398

hemiaminal functional group that decomposes readily to the corresponding imine or aminal.54,57,58

399

Regioselective toxicity of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q isomers. Having successfully established that the

400

unique regioselective hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q is due to its C4 tertiary carbon, we sought to

401

determine the role of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q in mediating the toxicity of 6PPD-Q in sensitive

402

salmonid species. Unfortunately, rainbow trout cell lines have not been benchmarked for 6PPD-Q

403

toxicity testing. Indeed, RTG-2, RTgill-W1, and RTL-W1, three commonly used rainbow trout

404

cell lines, were found insensitive to 6PPD-Q.59,60 Therefore, we decided to use the coho salmon

405

CSE-119 cell line as it has been recently benchmarked as an in vitro model for the toxicity testing

406

of 6PPD-Q.28 As shown in Figure 4A, consistent with previous studies,28 6PPD-Q induced the

407

cytotoxicity of CSE-119 cells with an EC50 of 17.1 µg/L by using the AlamarBlue assay. The

408

AlamarBlue assay relies on the redox property of a reporter dye, resazurin, which might be

409

confounded considering the antioxidant property of 6PPD.61 We then employed an orthogonal

410

Neutral Red Assay, which relies on the passive uptake of a red dye (3-amino-7-dimethylamino-2-

411

methyl-phenazine hydrochloride) into healthy cells.29 Consistent with the results from the

412

AlamarBlue assay, 6PPD-Q also induced the cytotoxicity of CSE-119 cells with an EC50 of 16.9

413

µg/L as measured by Neutral Red (Figure 4B). The two independent bioassays confirmed the CSE-

414

119 cell line as an in vitro model for the toxicity testing of 6PPD-Q.

AlamarBlue and B) Neutral Red assays revealed the highly regioselective toxicity of alkyl-OH6PPD-Q metabolites.

421

We then proceeded to test the cytotoxicity of C3- and C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q by using our

422

synthesized chemical standards. As shown in Figure 4, cytotoxicity was detected for C3-alkyl-OH-

423

6PPD-Q in both assays, albeit with ~5-fold weaker toxicity than native 6PPD-Q in both Alamar

424

Blue (EC50 = 67.4 μg/L) and Neutral Red (EC50 = 101 μg/L) assays. This was not completely

425

surprising, as our previous study has already demonstrated that the toxicity of 6PPD-Q is sensitive

426

to even minor structural modifications on its alkyl side chain.8 We then proceeded to test the

427

toxicity of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q and, surprisingly, cytotoxicity was not detected by either Alamar

428

Blue or Neutral Red assay. The lack of toxicity of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q was in stark contrast to

429

the toxicity of C3-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q, which was only marginally different than that of 6PPD-Q.

430

This was remarkable considering the close proximity of the C3 and C4 carbons. The total loss of

431

toxicity upon hydroxylation of the C4 tertiary carbon of 6PPD-Q highlighted its importance and

432

demonstrated that this carbon, which amongst the other PPD-Qs uniquely consists of only carbon

433

substituents, is crucial for its toxicity and may account for the structural selectivity observed in our

434

previous studies.8,9

435

Confirmation of the low toxicity of OH-6PPD-Q metabolites formed in liver microsome.

436

While we discovered the total loss of toxicity of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q via synthesized standards,

437

this does not necessarily mimic physiologically relevant conditions. For example, it is common

438

for CYP450 enzymes to form enantioselective metabolites which may not be captured by our

439

synthesis.62–64 To further investigate the toxicity of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q under physiologically

440

relevant conditions, we decided to directly isolate the C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q and other metabolites

441

from rainbow trout liver microsome for toxicity testing. To achieve this, we scaled-up our

442

microsome incubation protocol to achieve a higher concentration of metabolites that would be

443

amenable to toxicity testing. Following a 5 hr incubation of 6PPD-Q in liver microsome, we

444

extracted and exposed the resulting mixture of 6PPD-Q and its metabolite products (“microsome

445

mixture”) to CSE-119 cells. As shown in Figure 5A, the cytotoxicity of the microsome extracts

446

decreased after metabolism, compared to native 6PPD-Q. To further confirm this result was not

447

influenced by potential matrix effect from microsome extracts (e.g., by lipids or other cellular

448

components that may have been co-extracted alongside the metabolites)65, we co-incubated 6PPD-

449

Q with microsome control extracts (i.e., that was not previously incubated with 6PPD-Q). Similar

450

cytotoxicity effects were observed in the absence or presence of the microsome extracts (Figure

451

S12), and therefore the possibility of interference by matrix effects could be excluded.

To further examine the toxicity contributions of individual metabolites, the microsome mixture

was then fractionated via HPLC, wherein 5 compounds were separated into different fractions: a

di-OH-6PPD-Q product (“di-OH-6PPD-Q A”; F4), an additional di-OH-6PPD-Q product (“di-OH-

466

(Figure 5B). The formation of di-OH-6PPD-Qs from 6PPD-Q was previously reported in rainbow

467

trout in vivo.9 While we didn’t detect di-OH-6PPD-Q metabolites in our prior microsomal

468

incubations, their production here was unsurprising as the scaled-up conditions yielded a higher

469

abundance. We then proceeded to expose CSE-119 cells to the F4,, F5, F6, F7, and F9 fractions

470

alongside a 6PPD-Q chemical standard to probe their relative toxicities. While comparable

471

toxicities were observed between F9 and the 6PPD-Q chemical standard (Figure 5C), no dose-

472

dependent toxicity was observed for the fractions containing hydroxylated metabolites (F4-7),

473

including the fraction of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q (F6; Figure 5D). The low toxicity for the fractions

474

of metabolites were further confirmed with the Neutral Red Assay (Figure S13). Together with the

475

toxicity results from synthesized standards and microsome extracts, we concluded that the

476

hydroxylation of 6PPD-Q on the C4 carbon is likely a detoxication pathway. Future studies are

477

warranted to confirm these results using in vivo toxicity testing in rainbow trout and coho salmon

478

fish.

479
480

Implications

481

The unique formation of an alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q metabolite from 6PPD-Q was first reported in

482

our previous study,8 but its potential role in the toxicity of 6PPD-Q remains unknown. We herein

483

synthesized the chemical standards of alkyl-OH-6PPD-Qs and confirmed C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q

484

as the predominant alkyl hydroxylated metabolite formed in rainbow trout. Moreover, we

485

discovered that hydroxylation at this C4 position results in the total loss of toxicity of 6PPD-Q in

486

CSE-119 cells. These results did not support the bioactivation hypothesis that alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q

487

might mediate the toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Instead, hydroxylation on the C4 carbon appears to be a

488

precisely regulated detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q, as hydroxylation on the nearby C3 carbon

489

only minorly influences toxicity. These results were further supported by the formation of C 4-

490

insensitive to 6PPD-Q.7 This demonstrated that the production of C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q is not

492

unique to sensitive species such as rainbow trout. This finding can narrow the focus of future

493

toxicological investigations to native 6PPD-Q, as it, rather than its C4-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q

494

metabolite, appears to be the toxic species. Determining the exact binding protein of native 6PPD-

495

Q in future studies is critical to understanding its toxicity mechanism in-depth.

496

The most striking observation in the current study is the importance of the C 4 tertiary carbon

497

in both the metabolism and toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Our previous study highlighted the importance of

498

the alkyl side chain for the unique toxicity of 6PPD-Q,8 as toxicity was not observed for other

499

PPD-Qs with distinct alkyl side chains. In the current study, the complete loss of toxicity for C4-

500

alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q in contrast to C3-alkyl-OH-6PPD-Q further highlighted that the C4 tertiary

501

carbon on the alkyl side chain of 6PPD-Q might be the key structural feature for its unique toxicity.

502

To further explore the relevance of the C4 tertiary carbon of 6PPD-Q, it would be highly interesting

503

for in-depth exploration of structure-toxicity relationship via the synthesis of PPD-Q analogues

504

bearing similar structural features (i.e., tertiary carbon with various alkyl substituents).
