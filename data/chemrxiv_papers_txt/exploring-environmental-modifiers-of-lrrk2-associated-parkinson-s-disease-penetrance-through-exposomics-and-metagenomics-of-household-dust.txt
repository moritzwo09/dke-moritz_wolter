Abstract
1

Pathogenic variants in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are a primary monogenic cause of

2
3

Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the likelihood of developing PD with inherited LRRK2 pathogenic
variants differs (a phenomenon known as “reduced penetrance”), with factors including age and

4
5

geographic region, highlighting a potential role for lifestyle and environmental factors in disease onset.
To investigate this, household dust samples from four different groups of individuals were analyzed

6
7

using metabolomics/exposomics and metagenomics approaches: PD+/LRRK2+ (PD patients with
pathogenic LRRK2 variants; n=11), PD-/LRRK2+ (individuals with pathogenic LRRK2 variants but

8
9

without PD diagnosis; n=8), iPD (PD of unknown cause; n=11), and a matched, healthy control group
(n=11). The dust was complemented with metabolomics and lipidomics of matched serum samples,

10
11

where available. A total of 1,003 chemicals and 163 metagenomic operational taxonomic units
(mOTUs) were identified in the dust samples, of which ninety chemicals and ten mOTUs were

12
13

statistically significant. Reduced levels of 2-benzothiazolesulfonic acid (BThSO3) were found in the PD/LRRK2+ group compared to the PD+/LRRK2+. A negative and statistically significant association

14
15

was observed between BThSO3 and Pseudomonas spp. (detected via metagenomics), which are known
for degrading benzothiazoles. Among the significant chemicals tentatively identified in dust, two are

16
17

hazardous chemical replacements: Bisphenol S (BPS), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBuS).
Furthermore, various lipids were found altered in serum including different

18
19

lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) , some with higher levels
in the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared to the control group. A cellular study on isogenic neurons

20
21

generated from a PD+/LRRK2+ patient demonstrated that BPS negatively impacts mitochondrial
function, which is implicated in PD pathogenesis. This pilot study demonstrates how non-target

22

metabolomics/exposomics analysis of indoor dust samples complemented with metagenomics can

23

prioritize relevant chemicals that may be potential modifiers of LRRK2 penetrance.

1. Introduction

32

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1.8% of individuals over the age of 80

33
34

years globally, with an increasing prevalence due to the progressive aging of the population [1]. PD is
characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) inside neurons,

35
36

leading to the formation of Lewy Bodies, which promote neuroinflammation and the irreversible
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and other brain regions

37
38

[2], [3], [4], [5]. The clinical hallmarks of PD are tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and later in the disease,
postural instability [2]. However, these typical motor features do not become evident until 60-80% of

39
40

dopaminergic neurons are lost, such that other indicators are needed for earlier diagnosis [6]. Nonmotor symptoms related to PD, such as constipation and REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), can

41
42

occur decades before the onset of the classical motor symptoms but often go unrecognized [2], [5], [6],
[7]. Since not all PD patients have Lewy bodies or positive α-syn readings [8], [9], recently, a biological

43
44

classification of PD has been proposed for research purposes, which considers the presence or absence
of α-syn pathology, features of neurodegeneration, and genetic contributions [10].

45
46

Although the exact cause of most of patients with PD remains unknown, recent studies suggest that a
combination of genetic and environmental risk factors may play a key role in the development of the

47
48

disease [2], [6], [11]. Typically, monogenic PD comprises five dominantly inherited forms (SNCA,
LRRK2, VPS35, RAB32 and CHCHD2) and three recessively inherited forms (PRKN, PINK1, and

49
50

PARK7) [10], [11]. Mitochondrial dysfunction may occur already in the early stages of PD pathogenesis
and plays a crucial role in both sporadic and familial forms of the disease [12], [13]. Gene variants of

51
52

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common monogenic cause of PD, accounting for 12% of all cases [14], [15], [16], [17]. Most of the LRRK2 pathogenic variants result in increased kinase

53

activity of the LRRK2 protein, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and promoting inflammatory

54
55

responses that may result in chronic neuroinflammation and gut inflammation [2], [15]. In addition to
PD, LRRK2 has been linked to inflammatory diseases including Crohn’s Disease, leprosy and

56
57

tuberculosis [2], [18]. While the p.G2019S pathogenic variant of LRRK2 is the best known and most
common, not all carriers of this variant will develop PD, a phenomenon termed “reduced penetrance”

58
59

[2], [15], [19], [20]. Importantly, the penetrance is age-dependent and differs across geographic regions.
For example, in Tunisia, 61% of LRRK2 p.G2019S carriers developed PD by the age of 60 years, and

60
61

86% by the age of 70. In contrast, in Norway, only 20% of carriers developed the disease by age 60, and
43% by age 70 [19], [21]. This suggests that factors beyond genes, such as lifestyle or environment, may

62
63

play a crucial role in triggering the onset of the disease [2]. Various environmental factors have been
previously associated with an increased risk of PD, including the exposure to metals (e.g., Cu, Fe and

64
65

Zn) and pesticides (e.g., rotenone and paraquat) [22]. In contrast, smoking, caffeine consumption, and
the use of anti-inflammatory drugs have been linked with a reduced PD risk [22], [23]. The

66

LRRK2/Luebeck International Parkinson's Disease Study (LIPAD) cohort is one of the largest

67
68

multinational cohorts of genetic PD, focused on LRRK2-associated PD and healthy LRRK2
pathogenic variant carriers aiming to identify modifiers of LRRK2 penetrance [19]. This study includes

69
70

the household dust from selected LIPAD cohort participants to determine whether this can potentially
reveal potential chemical exposures and taxa of interest that may influence LRRK2 penetrance.

71
72

In urban environments, humans spend about 90% of their time indoors [24], exposing themselves to a
wide range of chemicals and microbes that may enter the body via ingestion, inhalation or dermal

73
74

contact [25], and could have an impact on health. Dust acts as a repository of multiple compounds that
are present or transported indoors and thus could be an indicator of the “human exposome” [26].

75
76

Estimates of the number of chemicals in household use range between 30,000 and 70,000 [27].
Nevertheless, most studies investigating dust so far have involved targeted analyses i.e., limited only to

77
78

dozens of chemicals [15], [26], while house dust can be contaminated with a broad range of chemicals
including pesticides, personal care products, and plasticizers, which can only be explored in greater detail

79
80

using a non-target approach [26], [28]. PubChem, which contains 118 million chemicals as of July 2024,
is one source of such information [29], but is too large for efficient cheminformatics workflows. Instead,

81
82

the PubChemLite for Exposomics collection leverages the comprehensive knowledgebase within
PubChem to form a relevant subset for exposomics studies, compiled from ten different categories in

83
84

the PubChem Compound Table of Contents (TOC) Classification Browser [30], comprising ~400,000
chemicals [31], [32]. Other environmentally relevant information sources include the NORMAN

85
86

Suspect List Exchange (NORMAN-SLE) [33], which is a collection of more than 100 lists of chemicals
covering a wide range of chemical classes contributed by the environmental community and compiled

87
88

by the NORMAN network [34], [35]. NORMAN-SLE lists are given a “S” number and code and
include collections such as cosmetics (e.g., S13 EUCOSMETICS [36]), chemicals registered for use in

89
90

Europe exceeding one tonne per year (S32 REACH2017 [37]), and neurotoxicants (e.g., S37
LITMINEDNEURO [38]). In 2016, the NORMAN network organized a collaborative non-target trial

91
92

on household dust, with close to 2,350 compounds identified or tentatively identified in those dust
samples [26]. The results are also available in the NORMAN-SLE as suspect list (S35 INDOORCT16)

93
94

[26], [39]. Both gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) were used, with only 5% of the detected compounds overlapping between these

95
96

two techniques. While LC-MS allowed the detection of glycols, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and
biogenic compounds in the samples, GC-MS detected more non-polar compounds, including

97

hydrocarbons and chlorinated paraffins [26].

98

Household dust also acts as the main reservoir of microbial taxa in the domestic environment, since it

99
100

includes particulate matter from soil, plants, human and animal skin. The household dust microbiome
influences the host microbiome [24], with some studies investigating the potential effects of dust-borne

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

101

microbial taxa on allergy, asthma, immune system, and gut microbiome [24], [40], [41]. One of the

102
103

challenges of metagenomic studies of dust samples is the high diversity of indoor microorganisms , with
an overall microbial diversity on Earth estimated to be approximately one trillion organisms [42], and

104
105

between 500 and 1,000 different species reported in household dust [43]. A study examining paired
samples of dust and feces revealed significant co-occurrences of Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridia and

106
107

Gamma proteobacteria in both samples [44]. Another study indicated a potential link between
household dust exposure and sphingolipid metabolism impairment associated with allergic processes

108
109

[45]. Furthermore, the dust microbiome may be involved in the biotransformation of chemicals
analogous to what is seen in other environments [46]. Household dust also contains multiple endocrine-

110
111

disrupting chemicals impacting human physiology, leading to triglyceride accumulation in in vitro
models (pre-adipocyte mouse cells) [47]. Alterations in metabolism due to environmental exposures,

112
113

including household dust, may be partially attributed to the effect of dust modulating the host
microbiome, as previously proposed [44]. Household dust is a diverse mixture of artificial and natural

114
115

particles along with biological entities such as bacteria, molds and pollen, as well as ash, soot, skin
particles, and residues from building and consumer products [48]. Consequently, the analysis of

116
117

household dust is of great interest to investigate the human exposome, offering valuable insights into
the individuals’ environmental exposures.

118
119

As part of the LIPAD study [19], this work aims to identify potential environmental modifiers of the
penetrance of LRRK2 pathogenic variants through the analysis of household dust of four groups of

120
121

participants: PD+/LRRK2+ (PD individuals with pathogenic LRRK2 variants), PD-/LRRK2+
(individuals with pathogenic LRRK2 variants but without PD diagnosis), iPD (PD of unknown cause),

122
123

and a matched control group (individuals without pathogenic variants and without PD diagnosis),
through different metabolomics/exposomics and metagenomics approaches. This was complemented

124
125

with non-target metabolomics on paired serum samples, where available, to investigate potential
metabolomic differences between groups that could be attributed to environmental exposures.

126
127

Additionally, since alterations in bile acids (BAs) have been previously noted in PD [49], [50], [51], a
target study of BAs in serum was performed. Finally, a cell study in isogenic neurons generated from a

128
129

PD+/LRRK2+ patient was conducted to investigate the potential neurotoxic effects of a chemical
found in the household dust, using various readouts related to mitochondrial function. To our

130
131

knowledge, this is the first study investigating the environmental influences of LRRK2 penetrance
through the molecular analysis of household dust.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Sample collection

137
138

Samples from four different groups of individuals (Control, iPD, PD-/LRRK2+, PD+/LRRK2+,
explained above) were collected in Germany (36) and Turkey (4), with details provided in Table 1.

139
140

Additional information has already been published [19]. Participants with different LRRK2 variants
were included in this study. In the PD+/LRRK2+ group, seven participants carried the p.G2019S

141
142

variant, two had the p.N1437S variant, and one each had the p.R1441H and p.I2020T variants. In the
PD-/LRRK2+ group, six individuals carried the p.G2019S variant, while one each had the p.R1441C

143
144

and p.S901L variants. Importantly, carriers of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 68 PD-linked
genes were excluded in the iPD and control groups, as specified in the ROPAD protocol [16], [52].

2.2. Sample preparation
2.2.1. Dust

161
162

The sample extraction protocol for metabolomics/exposomics was adapted from Moschet et al. [28]
and Dubocq et al. [53]. Briefly, 50 mg of each dust sample was extracted using acetonitrile (ACN):

163
164

methanol (MeOH) (1:1, v/v). The extract was evaporated (Labconco CentriVap, -4 °C, 24-48 h),
reconstituted using 0.1 % formic acid (FA) in MilliQ water and MeOH (90:10, v/v), and filtered

165
166

(Phenex-RC 4 mm syringe filter, 0.2 µm). Ten internal standards were used to check the instrument
performance (see Table S1). Extraction blanks and quality control (QC) samples (Figure S1) were

159

167

prepared following the guidelines from Broadhurst et al. [54]. A standard mix of 170 polar compounds

168
169

(50 µM) was used to serve as reference standards later (see Table S2 for full listing). Further details are
given in the Supplementary Material (SM), section S1.1.1.

170
171

For the metagenomic analyses, 100 mg of each dust sample were aliquoted, and DNA was extracted
using the DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen, 12855-50). Tests were performed at three input

172
173

amounts (50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg), whereby 100 mg of material yielded the best output in terms of
DNA concentrations and quality, see S1.1.1 (Figure S2-S3) for details. The manufacturer’s protocol

174
175

was followed [55], with the exception that DNA extracts were eluted in 40 µL of sterile DNA-free PCRgrade water instead of 100 µL of Solution C6.

176

2.2.2. Serum

177
178

The protocol for the non-target LC-HRMS analysis was adapted from Cajka et al. [56] and Lange et al.
[57] , detailed in full in S1.1.2 and shown in Figure S4. Briefly, serum samples were thawed on ice and

179
180

extracted via liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with cold MeOH containing 14 SPLASH® LIPIDOMIX®
mass spectrometry standards (listed in Table S3, chromatograms shown in Figure S5-S6), methyl tert-

181
182

butyl ether (MTBE), containing cholesteryl ester 22:1 (CE22:1), and MilliQ water. The QC, extraction
blank samples, and the standard polar mix of 170 compounds (Table S2) were as described for the dust

183

samples.

184

For the targeted BA analysis, 50 μL of each serum sample was extracted with MilliQ water (containing

185
186

four IS) and cold MeOH. The IS were cholic-D4 acid (CA-D4), deoxycholic-D4 acid (DCA-D4),
lithocholic-D4 (LCA-D4), and glycocholic-D4 acid (GCA-D4). A mixture of fourteen targeted BAs (10

187
188

μg/mL) was prepared (listed in Table S4). This standard solution was further diluted step by step to
build the calibration curve. Further details are given in S1.1.2.

189
190

2.3. Instrumental analysis
2.3.1. Metabolomics/Exposomics/Lipidomics

191
192

Non-target analysis of dust and serum was performed on a Thermo Scientific Accela LC system coupled
to a Q Exactive™ HF (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) in both

193
194

positive (+) and negative (-) ionization modes. Dust samples were analyzed using an Acquity BEH C 18
reversed phase (RP) column (150 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm), and a SeQuant® ZIC-pHILIC 5 µm polymer

195
196

(HILIC) column (150 × 2.1 mm), each with the respective guard column. The HILIC method was also
employed to analyze the polar extracts of the serum samples. The HRMS was operated in full scan

197
198

profile mode with a scan range of 60-900 m/z. Complete details of the RP and HILIC LC-HRMS
methods are given in Talavera Andújar et al. [4].

199

The non-polar extracts of the serum samples were analyzed (lipidomics) with an RP method adapted

200
201

from a Cajka et al. [56], using an Acquity UPLC CSH C 18 RP column (100 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm) coupled
to a guard column (130Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm X 5 mm). Full details are given in S1.2.1.

202

2.3.2. Target Analysis of BAs

203
204

The target analysis of BAs (Table S4) was performed on a LC system coupled to a Thermo Orbitrap
Exploris 240. The HRMS was operated in negative ionization mode (full scan mode) with a scan range

205

of 100-620 m/z, with the same column as for the lipidomics analysis. Full details are given in S1.2.2.

206

2.3.3. Metagenomic analyses

207
208

DNA was quantified using Qubit fluorometer and Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay kits to obtain accurate
concentration values. A Nanodrop instrument was then employed to determine DNA quality through

209
210

the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios (Table S5). DNA libraries were prepared after PCR amplification,
taking the same starting DNA from each sample. 50 ng of DNA were used for metagenomic library

211
212

preparation using the xGen DNA library preparation kit (Cat. no. 10009822, Integrated DNA
Technologies) using xGen UDI-UMI adapters (Cat. no. 10005903). The genomic DNA was

213
214

enzymatically fragmented for 10 min and DNA libraries were prepared with PCR amplification. The
average insert size of libraries was 400 bp. Prepared libraries were quantified using Qubit (DNA HS kit,

215
216

Thermo) and quality checked with DNA HS kit on Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Sequencing was
performed at the LCSB Genomics Platform (RRID: SCR_021931) on NextSeq2000 (Illumina)

217

instrument using 2x150 bp read length.

2.4. Data Analysis
2.4.1. Metabolomics/Exposomics/Lipidomics

220
221

For the dust and serum (polar extracts), raw files (“.raw”) were converted to “.mzML” format using
ProteoWizard MSConverter (Version 3.0.20331.3768aa6e9 64-bit) [58]. The converted files were

222
223

analyzed with the open software patRoon (version 2.1.0) [59], [60], using the non-target and suspect
screening options. This was complemented with MS-DIAL (version 4.9.221218) [61] using version 17

224
225

of the MSP libraries; the MS-DIAL input parameters are given in Table S6. Further details are given in
S1.3.1 and Figure S7; the code for patRoon is available on GitLab [62].

For the lipid analysis in serum, the LC-HRMS raw data files were processed in MS-DIAL (parameters
given in Table S7) using the in silico LipidBlast [63] library. To complement the MS-DIAL lipid

228
229

annotations, which are similarity-based, LipidMatch [64], a rule based software, was employed (see
Figure S8). The annotations from MS-DIAL and LipidMatch were combined; LipidMatch

230

annotations were selected in case of duplicates.

231

Among all features identified by non-target and suspect screening approaches in dust and serum, only

232
233

those with MS/MS information and MS/MS match values were considered for further analysis and
chemical annotation. R (version 4.1.2) via RStudio (version 2022.02.3) was used to filter the samples.

234
235

Features with a relative standard deviation (RSD) > 50 % in the QC-pooled samples were discarded.
Since different cheminformatic approaches and software were employed to analyze the non-target and

236
237

suspect screening LC-HRMS data, four different types of criteria were used to annotate confidence
levels to the features (Table S8). Note that only high confidence features, Level 1 to Level 3 (matching

238
239

various criteria shown in Table S8), were considered in this study to ensure the quality of the biological
interpretation. Features were annotated as Level 1 when the match between the chemical standard

240
241

(Table S2) and tentative candidate (in the dust or serum) yielded a SpectrumSimilarity score ≥ 0.7 and
the retention time (RT) shift was <1 min. OrgMassSpecR [65], [66] was used to calculate spectral

242
243

similarity. Xcalibur Qual Browser (version 4.1.31.9) was used to check the RT and to extract the
MS/MS information. The annotated chemicals were classified using the MetOrigin web server [67] and

244
245

the PubChem Classification Browser [29], using both the PubChem Compound TOC [30] and the
NORMAN-SLE [68] browsers. Chemical structures generated using CDK Depict [69].

246
247

For the statistical analysis, peak intensity tables were uploaded to MetaboAnalyst 6.0 (web interface)
[70], normalized by sum, log 10 transformed and Pareto-scaled. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

248
249

was performed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 while Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honestly
significant difference (HSD) post hoc test was computed in R (version 4.1.2). A p-value < 0.05 was

250
251

considered as statistically significant in this study. Significant lipids in serum were subsequently
subjected to Lipid Pathway Enrichment Analysis (LIPEA) [71].

252
253

For the target screening of BAs, concentrations of the detected BAs were calculated by interpolating the
constructed IS-calibrated linear-regression curves of individual BAs, with the peak area ratios measured

254
255

form injections of the sample solutions. TraceFinder 5.2 General Quan (Thermo) was employed for this
analysis. GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.0) was used to perform ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD and graphs.

256

2.4.2. Metagenomic analyses and omics integration

257

The Integrated Meta-omic Pipeline [72] (IMP; v3.0 commit# 9672c874; available at GitLab [73]) was

258
259

employed to process paired and reverse reads using the metagenomic workflow with default settings. As
part of the workflow, metagenomic reads aligning with the human genome were filtered and removed.

260
261

Taxonomic profiles were generated using mOTUs (v2.0). Furthermore, reads were assembled into
contigs, which were used for gene predictions using Prokka [74], and subsequently annotated using the

262
263

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologous categories. The KEGG orthologous
(KO) genes were identified, and their coverages based on number of reads mapping to individual KOs

264

were used for subsequently analyses.

265

The mOTU table was normalized by the total sequence count following which MicrobiomeAnalyst 2.0

266
267

[75], [76], marker data profiling option, was employed to filter based on a prevalence threshold of 30%
across samples (minimum count requirement of one), and to compute alpha-diversity and core

268
269

microbiome composition. In addition, the ampvis2 [77] R package was employed for data visualization
purposes. As for the metabolomics/exposomics data, ANOVA test was computed in R and a p-value

270

<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

271

For the KOs, Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) were calculated in R, accounting for sequencing

272
273

depth per sample and gene lengths. Pathways from the significant KOs were obtained via the
KEGGREST [78] package in R, see the GitLab repository for details [62]. To provide a comprehensive

274
275

overview, TPM values of KOs sharing the same pathway were summed and ANOVA was performed to
identify the statistically significant pathways across groups.

276
277

The normalized abundance mOTU table (metagenomics) and normalized peak intensities table
(metabolomics/exposomics) were integrated using Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery

278
279

using latent components (DIABLO) within the mixOmics [79] package in R. Details about this analysis
are available in the GitLab repository [62]. Spearman’s correlation between the mOTUs and chemicals

280
281

was computed in R, using the cor.test function of the base R stats package, while the Corrplot package,
was used to perform the correlation plots.

282
283

The MultiGroupPower function from the MultiPower R package [80], [81] was applied to compute
the power calculations integrating the metabolomic/exposomic and metagenomic datasets, derived

284

from the dust analysis.

2.5.1. Generation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons

287
288

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were obtained from a PD individual carrying the LRRK2
G2019S variant. An isogenic control (IC) was engineered from the same line using CRISPR-Cas9

289
290

technology [82], [83], [84]. Neuronal cultures enriched in midbrain dopaminergic neurons were
generated following the Reinhardt et al. protocol [83], [85], details can be found in S1.4.1 and Table

291
292

S9. At day 29, cells were treated for 24 hours with bisphenol S (BPS) (Sigma, 43034), at two different
concentrations (100 µM and 500 µM), using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma, D2438) as a vehicle,

293
294

before staining and imaging. Details about the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitophagy assays
can be found in S1.4.2 and S1.4.3, respectively.

2.5.2. Image Analysis

298

Automated image analysis was performed using Matlab (version 2021a, MathWorks), adapting the

299
300

method detailed in Baumuratov et al. [86]. The analysis was performed on the HPC platform [87] from
the University of Luxembourg in collaboration with the LCSB Bioimaging platform. Features such as

301
302

mitochondrial mass (sum of mitochondrial pixels/sum of nuclei pixels), mitochondrial size (sum of
mitochondrial pixels/mitochondrial counts), mitochondrial membrane potential (mean intensity of

303
304

TMRE inside the mitochondrial mask), and normalized mitophagy (sum of pixels positive for
Mitotracker Green FM and Lysotracker Deep Red/sum of mitochondrial pixels) were extracted.

305
306

Statistical analyses and data visualization were performed in GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.0).
Comparative analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparisons

307

with the uncorrected Dunn’s test.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Dust Metabolome and Exposome
3.1.1 Overview of Chemical Composition

311

The chemical composition of the dust was analyzed by non-target LC-HRMS, using the different

312
313

cheminformatic approaches described above, resulting in 1,003 annotated chemicals (Level 1-3), with
ninety features being statistically significantly different (ANOVA p-value<0.05). Table S10 contains

314
315

detailed information about all annotations, including statistical results and MetOrigin classifications,
while Table S11 contains the statistically significant chemicals only. The potential sources of these

316
317

compounds according to the NORMAN-SLE [34] and PubChem Compound TOC [29] are shown in
Figure 2, while the MetOrigin [67] classifications are shown in Figure S9.

318
319

Hundreds of chemicals (784) in dust were found in different lists from the NORMAN -SLE tree
(Figure 2A). These NORMAN-SLE lists were selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of

320
321

the types of chemicals annotated in the household dust samples. Most matches (544, of which 51 were
significant) were found in the S32 REACH17 [37], which is a list of chemicals registered under

322
323

REACH, the European Chemical Legislation that requires registration of chemicals in use above one
tonne per annum [88]. Benzocaine, benzyl butyl phthalate, and scopoletin are some examples of

324
325

REACH chemicals found in household dust samples. Notably, 204 out of the 1,003 chemicals
identified in this study were previously noted in the NORMAN collaborative household dust trial [26]

326
327

(S35 INDOORCT16 list [39]). These included plasticizers such as dibutyl phthalate, pharmaceuticals
such as tramadol, benzocaine, ketoprofen, gabapentin and the fungicide carbendazim, one of the most

328
329

prevalent biocides in Italian household dust samples [89]. Furthermore, 151 chemicals were potential
ingredients of cosmetics, mapping to the S13 EUCOSMETICS [36] list, while 52 were present in the

330

list of chemicals associated with neurotoxicity (S37 LITMINEDNEURO [38]), including 2,4-

331
332

dinitrophenol and diethyltoluamide (DEET). Additionally, 89 chemicals associated with plastic
packaging (via S49 CPPDBLISTB list [90]) were tentatively identified, including dibutyl phthalate, and

333
334

bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. The overlap of chemicals across all these lists was high ( Figure 2B),
suggesting that most of the annotated compounds have multiple potential origins and/or reasons for

335

interest.

results are available in Table S10. Note that queriers were performed in April 2024.

341

Figure 2C shows the potential categories of chemicals based on the PubChem Compound TOC, with

342
343

overlap in Figure 2D. The “Use and manufacturing” category was the most prevalent, with such
information available for 549 of the annotated compounds. Disorders and diseases information was

344
345

associated with 453 compounds, including 4-chloro-3-methylphenol and DEET. Interestingly, 432
chemicals were classified as food by the PubChem Compound TOC (Figure 2 C), while 506 chemicals

346
347

were in this MetOrigin class (Figure S9A); 366 of these overlapped. Additionally, 282 chemicals are
potentially related to microbiota according to MetOrigin (Figure S9A). As for the NORMAN-SLE

categories (Figure 2B), the overlap across the different PubChem TOC categories was high (Figure

3.1.2 Relevant Chemicals Potentially Related to Penetrance

351

Ninety statistically significant chemicals were found across the groups, indicating potential relevance

352
353

for disease penetrance. Figure 3 shows the distribution of four of these: bisphenol S (BPS),
perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBuS), 2-benzothiazolesulfonic acid (BThSO3) and 2-phenylphenol

354
355

(2PP). Interestingly, the first two are replacements of hazardous chemicals; BPS (Figure 3A) emerged
as a “safer” alternative to bisphenol A (BPA) [91], while PFBuS (Figure 3B) is a substitute for

356
357

perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) [92]. All compounds illustrated in Figure 3 had elevated levels in
PD+/LRRK2+ compared to the PD-/LRRK2+ group. Thus, these compounds could be potential

358

targets for further investigations into environmental influences on LRRK2 penetrance in PD.

HSD post-hoc p-value. Note that p< 0.1 is displayed although only p<0.05 is considered statistically
significant here (marked with an “*”).

364
365

Significantly higher levels of BPS were found in the control group compared to the PD-/LRRK2+.
Higher levels of BPS were also observed in the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared to the PD-/LRRK2+

366
367

group (Figure 3A). Two other bisphenol species, bisphenol P and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether ( Figure
S10), were also annotated in the dust samples, albeit not found to be statistically significantly different.

368

BPS has been employed extensively in industry to produce BPA-free products. However, BPS can have

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

369

similar or even greater toxicity than BPA [93], exhibiting stronger reproductive effects, DNA damage,

370
371

longer bioavailability, and better dermal penetration compared with BPA [94]. Additionally, BPS
exhibits higher resistance to biodegradation, rendering it more prone to accumulate and persist in the

372
373

environment [91]. It can disrupt lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, vitamin
metabolism, and induce oxidative stress [94]. BPS can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) [95] and may

374
375

trigger neurotoxicity through different pathways, potentially posing a risk factor for the development
of neurodegenerative diseases including PD [91], [94]. Therefore, this compound was tested in cell-

376

based models (neurons), to investigate its potential neurotoxic effects, as discussed in Section 3.5.

377

The dust analysis revealed significantly lower levels of PFBuS (Figure 3B) in the PD-/LRRK2+

378
379

participants compared to the iPD and control groups, while a similar lower trend was found in PD/LRRK2+ group compared with PD+/LRRK2+. PFBuS is a per-/polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS),

380
381

which is a group of substances of high environmental and toxicological concern due to their long -term
environmental persistence and toxicity to organisms, including humans [96]. PFBuS, a relatively short-

382
383

chain PFAS, is currently used as substitute for PFOS due to lower toxicity and bioaccumulation [92],
[97]. However, adverse effects including cytotoxicity, endocrine disruption, immunotoxicity,

384
385

reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity have been associated with PFBuS [92], [97].
PFBuS can cross the BBB, affecting the Central Nervous System (CNS). While PFBuS is considered less

386

toxic than PFOS, both compounds exhibited similar mechanisms of toxicity in zebrafish models [97].

387

Ten additional PFAS were annotated in dust, including the pesticide fipronil and its transformation

388
389

products fipronil desulfinyl and flipronil sulfone, which were mainly found in one patient from the iPD
group (Figure S11A-C). Fipronil, a PFAS-containing pesticide subject to stringent regulations in

390
391

Europe due to its potential environmental and health-related risks, was (unexpectedly) identified in the
dust samples. Although the use of fipronil in food production for human consumption was banned in

392
393

Europe in 2013, eggs contaminated with fipronil were found in the Netherlands and neighboring
countries in 2017 [98], [99]. The veterinary application of fipronil emerged as a significant potential

394
395

source of this compound in household dust across Europe. Nonetheless, a prior study conducted in
Italy in 2016 noted that the highest levels of fipronil were observed in a household dust without pets

396
397

[100]. These findings, coupled with our observation of fipronil in German household dust, underscore
the necessity for continued regulatory interventions in Europe. Fluorometuron (Figure S11D), another

398
399

PFAS-containing pesticide, was also tentatively identified with overall higher peak intensities in the PD/LRRK2+ dust samples. Additionally, PFAS-containing pharmaceuticals were annotated, including

400
401

fluoxetine, flutamide, and etofenamate, without significant differences across groups (Figure S12). A
PFAS with multiple industrial uses, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA), had a non-significant

402

lower trend in the PD-/LRRK2+ group compared to the control (Figure S13A).

403

Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS), an ultra-short chain PFAS, showed statistically higher levels in

404

the dust from the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared to the PD-/LRRK2+ (Figure S13B).

405

2-Benzothiazolesulfonic acid (BThSO3) was found at statistically significantly lower levels in the PD-

406
407

/LRRK2+ group compared to the PD+/LRRK2+ (Figure 3C). This trend was also consistent with its
transformation product, 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OBTh), as shown in Figure S14A. Benzothiazole

408
409

(BTh), a parent compound of OBTh, 2-(4-morpholinyl)benzothiazole (24MoBTh), and 2aminobenzothiazole (ABhT) were also detected in the dust samples, without being statistically

410
411

significantly different (Figure S14B-D). Benzothiazoles (BThs) have multiple applications, including
as vulcanization accelerators in rubber manufacture, fungicides, antialgal agents, slimicides,

412
413

chemotherapeutics and corrosion inhibitors [101]. BThs undergo chemical, biological and
photodegradation in the environment, leading to the formation of several transformation products

414
415

[102], as shown in Figure S15 and discussed later (Section 3.3). Previous studies have associated BThs
with different toxic effects, including carcinogenicity [102], [103], [104] and impaired child

416
417

neurodevelopment due to prenatal exposure [105]. However, the environmental exposure to these
compounds and the long-term consequences are presently unresolved.

418
419

2-Phenylphenol (2PP), an antimicrobial agent used in household products and included in the
European Union pesticides database, was found with statistically significantly higher levels in the

420
421

PD+/LRRK2+ group compared with the three others (Figure 3D). 2PP was previously found in
household waste [106], food and dairy products [107] and cosmetics (S13 EUCOSMETICS list [36],

422
423

as illustrated in Figure 2A). It is also listed as a potential endocrine disruptor in the S109 PARCEDC
list of potential endocrine disrupting compounds [108]. Moreover, a recent rat-based study showed

424
425

that the exposure to this compound altered phospholipid, fatty acids, sterol lipid, and amino acid levels
[109].

426
427

While four chemicals have been discussed in more detail here due to their relevance as potential
neurotoxic compounds in the environment and for space reasons, another 86 compounds were found

428

to be statistically significant across groups, as detailed in Table S11.

429

3.2. Differentially Abundant Taxa and Microbial Gene Signatures

430
431

To complement the dust-derived metabolomics/exposomics, the microbial communities of the dust
samples were analyzed at different taxonomic ranks (from kingdom to species). A total of 1,782

432
433

metagenomic operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) were initially characterized ( Table S12). This
initial list was reduced to 163 mOTUs for subsequent analysis (Table S13), after filtering to remove

434
435

low quality or uninformative features, as indicated in the Material and Methods section. Notably,
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes emerged as the three most abundant phyla (Figure 4A).

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

436

The dominance of these phyla in household dust aligns with multiple previous studies [28], [110],

437
438

[111]. Actinobacteria spp. were found with the highest abundance in the iPD dust samples, matching
observations in previous studies showing this genus to be enriched in feces from PD patients [3], [112].

439
440

The core microbiome at the species level was investigated (Figure 4B), with Cutibacterium acnes the

441
442

most prevalent species. This shows the significant biological components of the dust, including skin
cells. Interestingly, lower alpha-diversity was noted in the iPD group (phylum level) compared to the

443
444

control group (Figure 4C-D). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the
alpha-diversity at species level (Figure S16), aligning with previous studies which reported no

445
446

significant differences in the alpha-diversity in the feces of PD patients compared to the control
participants [3], [112].

and (D) Simpson Index at phylum level. p= Tukey’s HSD post-hoc p-value. Note that p< 0.1 is displayed
although only p<0.05 is considered statistically significant here (marked with an “*”).

453

Ten mOTUs were differentially abundant across groups (p< 0.05, ANOVA; Table S13 and Figure

454

S17), including Clavibacter michiganensis, Marmoricola sp. Leaf446, three different species of

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

455

Nocardioides and Sphingomonas, Candidatus Rickettsiella isopodorum, and Acinetobacter parvus.

456
457

Intriguingly, for all these mOTUS, the PD-/LRRK2+ group showed the lowest abundances.
Clavibacter michiganensis (Figure S17A), recognized as a plant pathogen [113], demonstrated a

458
459

significant increase in the iPD group compared to the control and PD-/LRRK2+ groups. The same
trend was observed for Marmoricola sp Leaf446. (Figure S17B). This species has been mainly isolated

460
461

from environmental sources, however a previous study found the Marmoricola genus to be highly
abundant in the nasal microbiota of PD patients compared to control individuals [114]. Nocardioides

462
463

(Figure S17C-E), was found elevated in the iPD group compared to the PD-/LRRK2+. Of note,
Nocardioides spp. can degrade a wide range of organic pollutants such as nitrophenol, ibuprofen,

464
465

cotinine, melamine, or atrazine. Furthermore, Nocardioides can carry out steroid biodegradation and
biotransformation [115]. Sphingomonas spp. (Figure S17F-H), was found significantly higher in the

466
467

dust samples from the iPD compared to the PD-/LRRK2+ group. Interestingly, a previous study
reported higher abundances of Sphingomonas genera in feces samples from PD patients, compared to a

468
469

healthy control group, associated this with motor complications [116]. Candidatus Rickettsiella
isopodorum (Figure S17I), an intracellular bacterium infecting terrestrial isopods [117], was

470
471

significantly higher in the control group. Lastly, statistically significantly elevated abundances of
Acinetobacter parvus (Figure S17J) were observed in the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared to the others.

472

This is an opportunistic pathogen associated with nosocomial infections.

473

In addition to the differentially abundant taxa, a total of 14,444 different KOs were characterized, of

474
475

which 624 were statistically significant across groups. Pathways from the significant KOs were obtained,
resulting in 269 KEGG pathways (Table S14) of which 207 were statistically significant. Figure 5

476
477

illustrates the distribution of some of those pathways across groups, whereby the top thirty statistically
significant pathways are represented in Figure S18. Notably, “microbial metabolism in diverse

478
479

environment”, “carbon metabolism” and “glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism” pathways were
increased compared to the control and iPD groups, compared to the PD-/LRRK2+ and

480
481

PD+/LRRK2+ groups (Figure 5A-C). Furthermore, arginine, proline, phenylalanine, and butanoate
metabolism exhibited the same trend, i.e., significatively decreased in PD-/LRRK2+ compared to the

482
483

control and iPD groups (Figure S19). In contrast, an increase in ribosomal genes was observed in PD/LRRK2+ and PD+/LRRK2+ groups, suggesting that dust-borne bacteria might be compensating the

484
485

lower metabolism (Figure 5D). Finally, both beta-lactam and vancomycin resistance appear to be
elevated in PD-/LRRK2+ and PD+/LRRK2+ (Figure 5E-F). Overall, the pathways results (Figure 5)

show similar trends between control and iPD groups, and between PD-/LRRK2+ and PD+/LRRK2+.
This suggest that the indoor microbial environment was similar in the participants carrying pathological

488

variants of LRRK2.

3.3. Dust Omics Integration

494
495

Two different approaches were employed to investigate the potential relationships between the
chemicals and the microbiome constituents found in the household dust: (1) DIABLO, a framework

496

used to integrate the datasets of chemicals (Table S10), and mOTUs (Table S13) (Figure 6A-B); and

497
498

(2) Spearman correlation analysis, employed to explore in detail the potential correlation between some
genera (Rhodococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Arthrobacter spp.) and benzothiazoles (Figure 6C).

499
500

The DIABLO analysis (Figure 6A) indicated that PD-/LRRK2+ clustered separately from the rest of
the groups (left), while some iPD and control samples cluster together (right). This classification is

501
502

mainly driven by the metabolomics/exposomics data, as most of the selected features are chemicals.
Interestingly, two of the selected features are PFAS, PFBuS and 6:2 FTSA, which have lower levels in

503
504

the PD-/LRRK2+ group compared to the controls, as previously indicated (Figure 3B and Figure
S13A). Sample plots from the final DIABLO model in Figure 6B display the degree of agreement

505
506

between the two datasets. Importantly, the PD-/LRRK2+ samples clustered together in both
metabolomics and metagenomics datasets.

518

Certain species within the genus Rhodococcus have been reported to degrade BThSO3 (Figure 3C) to

519
520

OBhT (Figure S15) [101], [102]. Furthermore, BTh can be degraded by several bacterial species
including Rhodococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Arthrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. [102]. Interestingly,

521
522

all of these were identified in the dust samples, although only the first three species were included in the
filtered dataset (Table S13).

523
524

Spearman’s correlation analysis was subsequently performed between all the BThs identified in the dust
samples (Figure 3C and Figure S14), and Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas, and Arthrobacter species, known

525
526

for their capacity to degrade specific BThs [101], [102]. A negative and statistically significant
association was observed between Pseudomonas sp. and BThSO3 (Figure 6C). The same negative

527
528

association was found between Pseudomonas sp. and 24MoBTh, suggesting that this species may
degrade both BThSO3 and 24MoBTh. Intriguingly, our analysis unveiled a positive (p-value<0.1)

529
530

association between BTh and Rhodococcus fascians. This association may be explained by several factors,
including photodegradation or microbial degradation (e.g., by Pseudomonas) of other compounds such

531
532

as 24MoBTh leading to the formation of BTh. Additionally, the presence of multiple microorganisms
and chemicals in the household dust samples may influence the growth of Rhodococcus fascians and/or

533
534

BTh metabolism. Therefore, further studies in controlled environments are necessary to provide more
insights into the relationship between Rhodococcus fascians and BTh in household dust samples.

535
536

Overall, these results demonstrate agreement between both omics approaches as they effectively
discriminated the same group (PD-/LRRK2+). Furthermore, the findings suggest a potential

537
538

relationship between chemicals and microbes, indicating that some of the chemicals found in dust may
be metabolized by microbes.

539

3.4. Serum Metabolome, Exposome, and Lipidome

540

The analysis of dust samples was complemented by exploring the serum of some participants where

541
542

matched samples were available. This included a non-target screening of polar chemicals (Table S15)
and lipids (Table S16-17), as well as the quantitative target screening of BAs (Table S18).

543

3.4.1 Polar Chemicals in Serum

544
545

Forty-nine chemicals were annotated (Level 1-3) in the polar fraction of the serum samples, with three
statistically significant results (1,7-dimethyluric acid, pipecolic acid, and amantadine). After data

546

normalization, the PCA plot (Figure S20) displayed all the QC samples with a tight clustering. This

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

547

indicates that the instrument variation was effectively corrected, affirming a good system stability and

548

reliability of the results.

549

1,7-Dimethyluric acid, a metabolite of caffeine, was elevated in the control and PD-/LRRK2+ groups

550
551

compared with the PD+/LRRK2+ group. Although this metabolite was not found in the dust, the
parent compound (caffeine) was identified, without significant differences but with an average higher

552
553

normalized peak intensity in the control group (Figure S21). These results agree with previous studies
[118], [119], which proposed lower levels of caffeine and caffeine metabolites as potential diagnostic

554
555

biomarkers for early PD. Caffeine, a common psychostimulant, has shown neuroprotective effects (via
reduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)) and appears to improve motor symptoms in PD [118],

556
557

[119]. Lower levels of caffeine and its metabolites in PD patients might be explained by a malabsoption
in the small intestine. Although microbiome dysbiosis is a common feature in PD, to date it remains

558

unclear whether caffeine malabsorption in PD is influenced by this [119].

559

Pipecolic acid was found significantly lower in the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared to the iPD group.

560
561

This compound was also identified in the dust samples, without being statistically significantly different
(Figure S22). Interestingly, opposite trends were observed, which suggests that biological samples do

562
563

not always reflect environmental exposures. A previous study reported decreased levels of pipecolic acid
in plasma samples from pre-PD individuals, suggesting that this may be indicative of microbiota-gut-

564
565

brain axis (MGBA) dysregulation [120]. Pipecolic acid can be produced by intestinal bacteria and cross
the BBB [121], where it can act as a neurotransmitter, modulating the uptake of γ-aminobutyric acid

566
567

(GABA) by brain neurons [120], [122]. Moreover, pipecolic acid may originate from the breakdown of
lysine in human mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are organelles involved in many roles including

568
569

β-oxidation metabolism, and ROS homeostasis [120], [122]. Dysfunction of these organelles
contributes to the aging process and neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [123].

570
571

Amantadine is an antiviral and antiparkinson drug, which was exclusively found in the two PD groups
(iPD and PD+/LRRK2+), as expected. This trend was consistent for both dust and serum samples

572
573

(Figure S23). Furthermore, levodopa, the most commonly prescribed medication for first-line therapy
in PD, was found solely in the household dust of PD participants (iPD and PD+/LRRK2+, Table S10

574

for details) [6]. Importantly, the intake of amantadine, levodopa, and other dopaminergic drugs

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

575

(exclusively in the PD groups) may influence the metabolism, and consequently the observed results in

576

the serum samples.

577
578

3.4.2 Serum Lipidome

579
580

A total of 313 unique lipids were annotated (Level 2-3) in the serum samples by non-target LC-HRMS
analysis (Table S16), with 252 in ESI (+) and 61 in ESI (-), see S2.3 and Figure S24-25 for details

581
582

about the filtering and quality control approaches. The most abundant lipid categories in serum
included glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sphingolipids. Forty-three lipids were statistically

583
584

significantly different, primarily glycerophospholipids (34 of 43; Figure S24). Lipid pathway
enrichment analysis, computed with the significant lipids, revealed glycerophospholipid metabolism

585
586

and sphingolipid metabolism as the most altered pathways (Table S17), which is consistent with a
previous study performed in serum samples from PD and LRRK2 carriers [124].

587
588

Among the glycerophospholipids, phospathidylcholines (PCs) were significantly decreased in the
PD+/LRRK2+ or PD-/LRRK2+ compared to the other groups under study (Figure S26 and Table

589
590

S16). A significant decrease of PC 14:0_18:2 was observed in the PD+/LRRK2+ compared with the
PD-/LRRK2+ and iPD groups. PCs are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in membranes and

591
592

are involved in the control of inflammation, neuronal differentiation and cholesterol hom eostasis [125],
[126]. Thus, a decrease in PCs may contribute to the neuroinflammation and disease progression , as

593
594

previously suggested [125]. In contrast, some lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), breakdown products
of PCs, were significantly elevated in the PD+/LRRK2+ group, including LPC 18:1 and LPC 16:0

595
596

(Figure 7A-B). This is in line with a previous study [125], suggesting that alterations in LPCs serve as
markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress processes. Additionally,

597

lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), LPE 18:0 and LPE O-18:1 (Figure 7C-D), were significantly

598
599

elevated in the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared with the control group. This in contrast with previous
studies performed in plasma [127] and serum [125] of iPD participants, which found decreased levels

600
601

of LPE with the advance of the disease. Thus, it would be interesting to check further whether this
alteration is specific to patients carrying LRRK2 pathogenic variants. Previous studies have shown that

602
603

the BPS exposure in adipocytes [128] and macrophages [129] induce lipidome changes including
increased levels of PCs, LPCs, and LPEs.

The quantitative analysis of BAs in serum did not reveal any statistically significant differences (Table

609
610

S18), which is in contrast with recent work on Alzheimer’s disease progression in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) samples [130]. However, non-significant higher trends of the neuroprotective BAs

611
612

chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) were observed in PD-/LRRK2+
in comparison to the PD groups (Figure S27A-B). Higher but non-significant trends of the cytotoxic

613
614

BA deoxycholic acid (DCA) were also observed in the PD-/LRRK2+ group (Figure S27C). Previous
research has reported elevated levels of secondary cytotoxic BAs in PD, including DCA and lithocholic

615
616

acid, correlated with an increase in BA-metabolizing bacteria [2], [49]. Thus, the non-significant higher
trends of BAs found in the PD-/LRRK2+ and iPD groups may be explained by gut microbiome

617
618

dysbiosis, as the gut microbiota metabolize the primary BAs to produce secondary BAs such as DCA
[49]. However, this was not investigated further here due to the lack of significance. Since BAs are crucial

619
620

signaling molecules and key modulators of metabolism and immune homeostasis [131], investigating
BAs in future studies with larger sample sizes could provide additional insights.

3.5. Effects of BPS on Neurons

628

While the vast majority of studies on BPS so far have focused on its endocrine disrupting effects [91],

629
630

recent findings have linked this chemical to an elevated risk of neurodegenerative diseases [132]. The
potential neurotoxic effect of BPS found in the dust samples here (Figure 3A), in the context of

631
632

LRRK2-based PD, was explored in cultures enriched with dopaminergic neurons generated from a PD
individual carrying the LRRK2 G2019S variant and its isogenic control (IC), as shown in Figure 8A.

633
634

Exposure to BPS elicited distinct responses in the IC and PD+/LRRK2+ neurons, particularly at the
level of mitochondrial homeostasis. Functional evaluation of mitochondria upon BPS exposure showed

635
636

that the IC neurons respond by elevating the mitochondrial potential, a response not seen in the PD+
cells (Figure 8B). This may be interpreted as a compensatory response of IC neurons to increase ATP

637
638

production, or conversely, as a result of mild ATP-synthase inhibition, which leads to hyperpolarization
of mitochondrial membrane potential due to lower consumption of the mitochondrial proton gradient.

639
640

Disparate effects of BPS treatment were also observed in the averaged mitochondrial mass, i.e., the
volume of mitochondria per cell. Contrarily to the IC, the PD+/LRRK2+ neurons significantly

641
642

increased their mitochondrial mass (Figure 8C), suggesting that the PD cells accumulate mitochondria
due to an impaired mitochondrial clearance mechanism, as previously reported for PD+/LRRK2+

643
644

murine models [133]. Alternatively, the cells may intensify mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for
the BPS-induced insult. Furthermore, BPS negatively impacted (reduced) the organellar size in the

645
646

PD+/LRRK2+ neurons (Figure 8D), a response commonly seen upon mitochondrial stress, and which
is necessary for efficient clearance via mitophagy to occur. Interestingly, BPS had the opposite effect in

647
648

the IC line at 100 µM, with an increased mitochondrial size detected. Finally, the proposed alterations
in mitophagy were supported by the assessment of the normalized colocalization of mitochondria and

649

lysosomes, which suggests that IC neurons more efficiently initiate this clearance process ( Figure 8E),

650
651

and are therefore able to maintain higher mitochondrial fitness. Further experiments, beyond the scope
of this current effort, are ongoing to better understand the impact of BPS exposure on neurons.

4. Conclusions and future perspectives

664

Pilot studies, such as this one, play an important role in health research to develop, assess, and adapt the

665
666

methods employed, generate hypotheses and provide information for a sample size calculation for a
larger trial [134], [135]. Using the results generated in this study, a power analysis was undertaken using

667
668

the MultiPower method in R [80], [81] to calculate the optimal sample size for each group comparison
integrating both metabolomics/exposomics (1,003 chemicals, Table S10), and metagenomics (163

669
670

mOTUs, Table S13) datasets to help scope future studies. For an average statistical power of 0.8, the
estimated minimum sample size for each group in metabolomics/exposomics ranges between 40 and 89,

671
672

while for metagenomics it is 36-79. The overall optimal sample size would thus be 273 (Table S19 for
details), and the minimum sample size required per group comparison and omic dataset (metabolomics

673

and metagenomics) is shown in Figure S28, which is a challenge for specialized cohorts such as this one.

674

In this pilot study several significant differences were found in the indoor dust chemical and microbial

675
676

composition across study groups. Although previous studies have indicated that household dust acts a
reservoir of several chemicals and microbial taxa that may pose a risk to human health [24], [26], [136],

677
678

to our knowledge, the present study represents one of the early substantial efforts to investigate the dust
metabolome/exposome and microbiome in the context of PD, and more specifically in PD associated

679
680

with the penetrance of LRRK2 pathogenic variants. BPS, PFAS, and BThs showed significantly higher
levels in the PD+/LRRK2+ group compared with the PD-/LRRK2+ and should be investigated

681
682

further (with a larger sample size) to determine whether they could be potential modifiers of LRRK2
penetrance associated with PD. Moreover, several taxa and KOs were significantly different between

683
684

groups, with various species (e.g., Clavibacter michiganensis and Marmoricola sp. Leaf446) displaying
significantly lower abundances in the PD-/LRRK2+ group compared to the iPD group (Figure S17).

685
686

In line with previous reports based on the nasal microbiota from PD patients [114], it is worth
investigating whether the household environment could be responsible for some of the observations in

687
688

the host microbiome in future studies. Since oral ingestion of dust is a potential source of exposure to
environmental contaminants, especially concerning for infants/toddlers, the connection between dust

689

and the oral-gut axis [137] could be of interest for future investigations.

690

Differences in the serum lipidome and metabolome were observed, partially matching previously

691
692

published works. However, most of the chemicals found in dust, which may be potential risks for
human health, were not found in the serum samples. This may be because exogenous chemicals are

693
694

present at trace levels in biological samples compared with endogenous chemicals [138]. Importantly,
some of the differences observed in both dust and serum may be due to confounding factors. For

695
696

instance, the use of medication in the PD groups may influence the metabolism (although no clear
relationship was found here), while discrepancies in sample size and age between certain groups, may

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rczsl ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-9255 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

697

influence the results. The average age of the PD-/LRRK2+ group is ten years younger than

698
699

PD+/LRRK2+, which means that some patients may still develop PD at a later stage. However, it was
not possible to get a better match of ages with the samples available in the cohort at this stage .

700
701

This study has provided valuable insights for both collecting additional patient information as well as
designing future sample collection procedures that will enable better consideration of relevant lifestyle

702
703

factors in the next investigations. While improving dust sample collection is a subject under discussion,
it is logistically much easier for cohorts to obtain samples from household vacuum cleaners (with all the

704
705

additional variability that this collection method brings due to different brands and bags) rather than
deploy more advanced collection systems, which require training of both nursing staff and participants,

706
707

and make consistent application more challenging. Alternative collection procedures are currently being
tested with this cohort in other studies. While this current effort involved samples primarily from

708
709

Germany, it also included a limited number of samples from Turkey to ensure sufficient sample
numbers. As the cohort develops and more samples become available, it will be easier to form more

710
711

geographically consistent sample sets (in addition to better age matching between groups), which will
also ease the data interpretation. Nevertheless, this work has provided a vital basis upon which to design

712
713

future experiments. Additional insights are being gained through the participation in relevant
collaborative trials run by the NORMAN Network, including a second dust trial, which is in the

714

concluding phases, as well as the recently initiated NORMAN indoor air trial.

715

Finally, this study demonstrated that BPS, a compound found in the household dust samples with

716
717

statistically significant differences between groups, negatively affected mitochondrial function in
PD+/LRRK2+ neurons, providing avenues for further investigation. This underscores the importance

718

of exposome studies in prioritizing chemicals for further exploration with in vitro models.
