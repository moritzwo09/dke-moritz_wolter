ABSTRACT
Established desalination technologies such as thermal distillation and reverse osmosis
require advanced infrastructure and costly installation limiting their widespread implementation.
Floating interfacial solar evaporation devices are considered a land-saving, environmentally
friendly, and low infrastructure approach for freshwater production. Addressing issues related
to maximum heat localization, prevention of salt accumulation and operating under stressful
environmental conditions are some of the major challenges with floating solar desalination.
This project presents an experimental demonstration of a plasmonic TiC nanoparticle-based
floating solar still that can operate continuously under sunlight to produce clean water while
floating on saline water sources. All materials, such as the PVC plastic condensation dome,
EVA foam support, cotton wicks, and polyester filter fabric were chosen carefully to maximize
the freshwater output of the solar still. The outdoor experiments were conducted in Halifax,
Canada, where modest solar insolation of around 6 kW m-2 day-1 led to daily water yields up to
3.67 L m-2. The water can be produced at costs as low as $0.0086 L-1, and the solar still can be
easily modified to generate thermoelectricity. This could allow for small onboard devices to
test water quality without the need for an external electricity source. The results of this study
will contribute to further development of floating solar desalination to provide potable water
for water-stressed communities.

1. Introduction
One of the largest ongoing humanitarian concerns is the growing demand for sustainable
and economical clean water generation technology.1,2 Desalination has emerged as one of the
leading solutions to generate potable water.3 Thermal distillation and reverse osmosis (RO)
membrane separation are well developed techniques to purify saltwater, though generally
require centralized and infrastructurally demanding treatment plants.4–8 These are tied to high
energy consumption and major economic investments which restricts broad use, particularly in
developing countries or remote locations.9,10 This has caused a surge in alternative water
purification technologies, and desalination using abundantly available solar energy has become
an attractive method to improve water security in these regions.11 Most notable are floating
solar evaporation units as they can be deployed directly on a water source and require no land
use.12,13 Floating solar evaporation often uses strong light absorbers, known as photothermal
materials to convert sunlight into heat used for evaporation. Over the years, many different
platforms have been tested, with the most efficient using interfacial evaporation as opposed to
bottom heating or bulk heating where thermal losses are much higher (Figure 1).14

Reaching high efficiencies with floating desalination units requires high absorption of the
incoming solar energy, effective thermal management to prevent heat loss, and avoiding salt
buildup and contamination of the evaporation surface.15,16 Heat localization is achieved by
insulating the evaporation interface from the bulk water below to avoid heat loss and instead
transfers that energy to the small volume of water on the surface.17 Wicking structures that
provide sufficient flow of water across the evaporation surface via capillary action have been
shown to avoid buildup of salt and other contaminants that might affect long term desalination
efficiency.18 Increases in the amount of sunlight absorbed for conversion to heat is a material
consideration, and many light-to-heat conversion (or photothermal) materials have been
developed. These range from carbonaceous materials19–21 to thermally conductive
polymers,22,23 semiconductors,24,25 and plasmonic nanomaterials.26,27 Many of these effectively
absorb ≥90% of the solar spectrum, with corresponding solar to vapor generation efficiencies
greater than 85%, and have been summarized in recent reviews.28,29 Plasmonic nanomaterials
are particularly suitable for photothermal application as they can produce intense localized heat
from their interaction with incident light.30 Recently, refractory plasmonic nitrides and carbides
have garnered significant attention for desalination application given their superior
photothermal properties, low cost, and material stability.31–34
Most floating solar desalination research has been done only in controlled lab
environments, with real-world studies remaining scarce.35–39 To avoid stagnation of the field
and to prove the potential for floating desalination, it is important to test promising materials in
a real-world setting. This brings to the forefront new challenges associated with material
preparation, overall efficiency, and deployment.40,41 Some of the more elaborate material
compositions and designs tested in lab will not be feasible to scale up economically.42–46
Additionally, having a vapor collection system, convective cooling from ocean currents and
waves, and increased humidity within the collection system can all take a toll on the efficiency.
These factors are all in addition to retaining salt rejection capabilities. This has caused drastic

decreases for previously reported floating solar stills from ~90% to below 20% in most
cases.47-50
Nevertheless, several groups have undertaken these challenges. Gan et al. reported a
floating solar still using carbon coated paper on top of a polystyrene support that resulted in a
freshwater yield of 0.8 L m-2 day-1.51 Unfortunately, the accumulation of salt on the surface is
thought to have decreased the efficiency over time. Since then, Chen et al. have designed a
desalination still capable of salt-rejection during continuous use.52 This device employed a large
wicking area (~20%), and a freshwater production rate of 2.5 L m-2 day-1 was achieved. The
solar still also benefitted from a low material cost of $3 m-2, putting it over an order of
magnitude lower than conventional land solar stills. A root inspired solar still from Xie et al.
demonstrated that a 1-dimensional wick system could decrease the required wicking area to
only 2% while maintaining salt rejection.53 This afforded a freshwater generation rate of 1.5 L
m-2 day-1. A floating solar still by Aye et al. used a vacuum pump to increase their freshwater
yield to 4.3 L m-2 day-1, unfortunately this removed the passive nature of the solar still as it
required an electrical plug to operate, increasing complexity and cost.54 A final benefit to a
floating desalination system is the potential to simultaneously generate thermoelectric power.
Taking advantage of the temperature gradient between the evaporation surface and the colder
ocean water below using the Seebeck effect, a current can be generated by placing Peltier
modules across the platform. While this has been explored in a lab setting and suggested for
incorporating into a floating solar still, there has yet to be experimental results to date for a
scaled-up process.55–57
Herein, we develop a titanium carbide (TiC) nanoparticle (NP) based floating solar still
engineered to address the previously discussed technical obstacles. One of the key precursors
for the synthesis of TiC NPs, amorphous carbon, is made through the pyrolysis of waste tire
rubber making this a useful synthetic method from a recyclability standpoint. The solar still is
capable of efficiently generating freshwater long term without suffering from salt buildup or

large thermal loss. The design maintains operational stability with wind, waves, and currents.
The obtained freshwater was tested for microbe activity and a variety of potential contaminants
found in the source water. Additional modification of the solar still allows for the practical
generation of thermoelectric power, which was shown to run small devices and could be
incorporated as on-board water quality sensors in the future. The research is expected to
highlight the potential for floating desalination as an alternative to land solar stills for solar
desalination.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Synthesis and Evaporation Interface Preparation
Char derived from waste tire rubber and plasmonic TiC nanoparticles (NPs) were
prepared using a modified previously reported method.58,59 The schematic of the material
synthesis and interface fabrication is shown in Figure 2. In short, tires were ground into a fine
rubber crumb before undergoing pyrolysis at 500 °C for 1 h under inert atmosphere to form
amorphous carbon (Figure S1). Afterwards, the reaction mix was treated with concentrated
HNO3 (aq), followed by thorough washing in deionized water to yield porous carbon particles.
This appeared to be a mixture of larger porous carbon particles 14 ± 4 µm in size with a couple
larger particles reaching up to 50 µm (Figure S2A) and areas of smaller carbon particles >100
nm (Figure S2B). These smaller particles are likely carbon black which is used as an additive
in tire manufacturing. It is important to note that tires are not a desired item to end up at landfills,
as they can leach chemicals into the ground and nearby water sources. It is critical to find ways
to properly recycle them at the end of their life. The pyrolysis of waste tire rubber is an attractive
way to lock the carbon in its elemental form and to safely remove other fillers such as sulfur,
silica, etc.60 Using the amorphous carbon to create a value-added material makes the proposed
TiC NPs very interesting to recycle waste tire rubber.

The resulting char was ground with TiO2 and Mg powder until homogeneous. The
mixture was then reacted under Ar at 950 °C for 2 h. After cooling, the MgO side product and
any unreacted Mg was removed by sonicating the reaction mixture in 6.0 M HCl. The powder
X-ray diffraction pattern of the product showed only peaks corresponding to the rocksalt
structured TiC (Figure S3). The transmission electron microscopy showed the NPs to have an
average diameter of 12 ± 5 nm (Figure S4). Previous calculations have shown the localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) maximum of TiC NPs with 10 - 15 nm diameter to be below
150 nm.32 The absorbance spectrum of TiC NPs suspended in water (Figure S5) corroborated
with the calculations and the distinctive LSPR maximum is beyond the instrument detection
range. After thoroughly drying, the TiC NPs were vacuum loaded onto a large and porous
polyester filter using a vacuum box constructed in house (Figure S6). SEM images were taken
before and after TiC NPs were loaded onto the interface, which can be seen in the insets of
Figure 2A and shown fully in Figure S7. Polyester filter paper was chosen as a low-cost material,
and for its widespread availability and porosity. After loading the NPs onto the polyester filter
paper, the absorbance of the plasmonic interface broadened significantly to absorb over 95% of
the light between 200 – 1200 nm (Figure 2B). This is due to the plasmonic coupling between

particles within close proximity as shown in calculations performed previously on carbide
NPs.32

2.2 Desalination Experiments in Rooftop Pool and Ocean
The TiC interface was then placed within the floating solar still (Figure 3A). The still
consisted of cotton wicks (Zorb®) placed through a large disc of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)
foam with the purpose of transporting water to the interface on top of the foam while remaining
thermally insulated from the cold ocean water below. EVA provides good insulation while
being highly durable and shock resistant. The entire surface of the still was covered with a
polyvinyl chloride plastic dome to recondense the generated steam. PVC was chosen over other
polymers as it allowed the most solar radiation to reach the TiC interface both when dry and
wet resulting in the highest evaporation rates when tested in a lab setting (Figure S8 and S9).
To maintain structural integrity, a stainless-steel umbrella frame was used. The solar intensity
was tested at various points both inside and outside of the frame to rule out the possibility of
shading of the evaporation surface (Figure S10), with no significant differences observed.
After recondensing, the water will then be transported through another wick around the
perimeter of the solar still, where it will reach an exit tube and collect in an independent
collection bag. The freshwater collection wick is raised and shielded to avoid contamination
from saltwater.

with water taken from Halifax Harbour. (C) Testing directly in the Halifax Harbour (Atlantic
Ocean water).

Initial outdoor testing was conducted on a rooftop inside of a pool containing water
collected from the Halifax Harbour (latitude: 44° 36' 59.99" N, longitude: -63° 32' 59.99" W)
as shown in Figure 3B and the evaporated water was collected into a glass container
(Supplementary video 1). The solar still was tested for five consecutive days ranging from
mostly cloudy to sunny, and the solar radiation was tracked over the course of each day (Figure
4A). The results of the rooftop testing are summarized in Figure 4B. First, the solar still was
tested using a blank interface for comparison. This afforded a rate of 0.35 L m-2 day-1, equating
to a solar water generation efficiency of 4% using the following equation:

𝜂𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑙 =

𝑚𝐻2 𝑂 ∆𝑣𝑎𝑝 𝐻𝑚
𝐴𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑙 ∫ 𝑞𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 (𝑡)𝑑𝑡

(1)

where ηstill is the solar-to-water efficiency, mH2O is the mass of freshwater collected daily, Astill
is the solar still evaporation area, and the bottom term gives the total daily solar flux on the
surface of the solar still. When loaded with TiC NPs, the solar still generated more freshwater,
affording rates of 2.03 L m-2 day-1 on a mostly cloudy day (3.67 kW m-2) up to 3.67 L m-2 day9

on a fully sunny day (6.56 kW m-2). The maximum solar freshwater production efficiency

was 40% and remains high on both sunny and cloudy days. It should be noted that the testing
location (Halifax, Canada) has a more northernly latitude, with the peak sunlight intensity
reaching an equivalent of about 0.84 suns, or 84%, compared to AM1.5. All testing conditions
including daily sunlight intensities, ambient temperature, wind speed, and evaporation surface
temperatures are summarized in Figure S11 and Table S1.

After testing the performance of the solar still in the rooftop pool, it was deployed in the
Atlantic Ocean (Halifax, Canada) over five full days (Figure 3C). The chosen location is nearby
a large seaport and has had ongoing concern over elevated levels of toxic heavy metals. It is a
heavily traversed route by both boats and ships and has additional tidal currents and moderate

wave activity. This provided a challenging environment for the floating solar still to generate
water as a real-world deployment test. Over the days of study, a range of sunny to cloudy days
were encountered (Figure 4C and Table S2). As shown in Figure 4D, the max output was 3.36
L m-2 day-1 and the still produced at a rate of 2.23 L m-2 day-1 on a fully cloudy day. The solarto-water generation efficiencies were once again similar regardless of the intensity of incoming
light at 36-38%, just slightly below the rooftop experiments. This is likely due to an increased
conduction of heat from the interface to the water below due to ocean currents, which could
slightly decrease the overall efficiency.
After the five full days of testing, the solar still was deployed a final time to collect a
purified water sample, and the microbial content was measured using cellular adenosine
triphosphate (cATP) assay (Figure 5A). This gives a snapshot of the total biological
concentration in each sample. The heat generated by the TiC NPs has the potential to destroy
microbes and avoid fouling of the membrane and water transport system within the still. The
cATP levels of water taken directly from the Halifax harbour testing site were compared to the
desalinated sample. Another water sample was collected under controlled lab conditions with a
freshly prepared TiC interface and collected using a closed quartz vessel that had been fully
disinfected. The cATP concentration in both the solar still and laboratory evaporation samples
were decreased significantly to 0.48 ± 0.17 and 0.25 ± 0.02 pg mL-1, respectively, compared to
the harbour water (123 ± 40 pg mL-1). Both desalinated samples were below the guidelines set
by Health Canada of 1 pg cATP mL-1 and are approaching the standard of high purity water
which is set at 0.1 pg cATP mL-1.61 The cATP values for water samples from the solar still was
only slightly higher than the water desalinated in the lab, which is most likely due to the rigorous
cleaning process used for glassware before collecting the water. In contrast, the solar still had
been used for rooftop studies and out on the harbour for two weeks without any cleaning before
collecting the sample.

lines) and after (dotted lines) solar evaporation. (C) ICPMS ion concentration results before
(grey) and after (green) desalination. (D) Productivity of select solar stills in literature.

Following up on these results, dye separation and degradation experiments were
conducted using both methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated 1 sun
illumination in the lab (1000 W m-2). First, solutions of each dye were prepared, and the
absorbance spectra was compared to the collected water after evaporation (Figure 5B). The dye
absorbance in the collected water was negligible, indicating no contamination from either dye.
Secondly, the absorbance intensity of the dye in the source water was tested after various
evaporation times. As seen in Figure S12, the concentration dropped by 60% for MB and 32%
for RhB and this decrease in dye concentration was higher than when a blank evaporator was
used. This indicates the potential for photothermally induced organic pollutant degradation
using the TiC NPs and floating interfaces. The collected water was also tested for various ions
12

using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) to verify the extent of
purification (Figure 5C). Results show that all tested ions from salt and heavy metal impurities
are decreased by 3-5 orders of magnitude, putting the levels well below those set by the WHO.
The proposed solar still was compared to various passive floating solar stills, as well as
several passive land stills (Figure 5D and Table S3). The TiC based device (current work)
obtained higher daily productivity values than any floating solar still reported to date and is
even higher than some of the more productive land-based solar stills reported. This can be
attributed to the strong balance of water transport, interface thermal insulation, and high
photothermal efficiency of the TiC NPs worked into the design. Furthermore, in previous
studies it has been noted that when asymmetrically shaped condensation covers are used, if the
solar still doesn’t maintain a north to south orientation there would be a greater transmission
loss through the side walls. The still was overturned during the ocean experiments causing
damage and shortening the lifespan or requiring more frequent maintenance.53 The symmetry
of the still used in this work means that any orientation will have the same extent of transmission.
Additionally, the large footprint of the still and slight flexibility of the EVA foam made it easily
glide over incoming waves and avoid splashing over of water onto the surface.
Even though the efficiencies of land stills are slightly higher than any floating solar stills
for desalination, they generally cost more to install and run.62 This is in part because the ocean
water must be continuously transported to the still and contained within basins. The additional
use of land makes them potentially less desirable than floating solar stills. To further compare
our proposed technology with other floating and land solar stills, we completed a basic cost
analysis of the solar still built for this study. The method used was adapted from Fath et al. and
Bait et al. to calculate the cost per litre (CPL) using the still.63,64 This included the initial
investment cost, along with estimated annual interest rates (10%), service life (2 years), and
operation days per year (320 days). Additional values used throughout the calculations,
including material cost, water purchase price, interest rate, etc., and are tabulated in Table S4.

The wholesale prices for TiC NP synthesis and solar still components were sourced from the
Alibaba website. Electricity (0.11 $ kwh-1) and water prices (0.004 $ L-1) were taken from Nova
Scotia Power and Halifax Municipal Water, respectively. Annual cost includes possible
cleaning of still cover, replacement of wicks, and regular collection of distilled water. To
account for seasonal solar intensity fluctuations, the average daily insolation for the year was
used in the calculation.65 This contrasts with most reports which use the production values in
peak summer months for calculations. For this reason, there was assumed to be a linear trend
between water production and sunlight intensity. We chose two different locations, the first was
Halifax, Canada and the second was a more likely solar desalination destination of San Diego,
California. The average daily insolation values were 11.8 and 19.6 kW m-2 for Halifax and San
Diego, respectively and afforded CPL values of $0.0086 and $0.0052 L-1. Comparing this to
some of the most productive solar stills (Table S4), the proposed still has the lowest CPL and
is comparable in productivity to some of the best performing land stills. The payback periods
for the solar still were 290 days in Halifax, and 215 days in California. Interestingly, when
assuming a productivity equal to the peak summer insolation as done in other reports, the CPL
decreases to $0.0045 L-1 in Halifax. The selling price of the distilled water in the calculations
was the price from the local water utilities, though generally the cost of distilled water is
assumed to be much higher (~$0.15 L-1 vs $0.03 L-1) for water cost analyses.53 This would
further increase the economic efficiency of the proposed still.
2.3 Simultaneous Desalination and Electricity Generation
The generation of a relatively large temperature gradient between the evaporation
interface of the solar still and the ocean water below can be used to generate electricity.66 This
process, known as thermoelectric generation, make use of the Seebeck effect where the flow of
charge carriers at semiconductor p-n junctions induces an electrical current and voltage.
Coupling this process with solar desalination has been proposed with some examples of
14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-dhl01 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

laboratory scale studies and has been incorporated into a few of the land solar stills.55–57,67 It
has yet to be studied with a floating solar still but has the potential to power onboard devices
such as small water quality monitors or fans to enhance evaporation. The thermoelectric
generators (TGs) were added to the solar still by insetting them within the foam support. They
were adhered to aluminum heat sinks which protrude below the still (Figure S13). The TGs
were set in series and connected to a buck boost power converter to supply stabilized power to
the load. As a proof of concept, a small fan and USB-C port for phone charging were explored
(Figure 6A).
Testing was completed in a pool containing Halifax Harbour water directly beside the
harbour in February, where the average air temperature during the testing period was 0 °C. The
ocean temperature was also 0 °C, and the surface of the still during operation was 32 °C. Even
though the ambient temperature was lower than when tested during the summer, temperature
difference between the interface and the bulk water was very similar. At peak solar radiation
(13:00), 98 mL of water was collected for the hour, displaying the utility of the solar still even
at freezing temperatures (Figure 6B). The evaporation efficiency peaked at 33% on the testing
day, compared to 38% during summertime testing. This can be attributed to the lower air and
wind temperatures, which would increase the convective heat losses during the process. On
testing day, the maximum induced open-circuit voltage (Vopen-circuit) was measured to be 3.34 V,
with the short-circuit current (Ishort-circuit) reaching 486 mA (Figure 6C). This demonstrates the
year-round utility of the solar still for simultaneous water and electricity generation. To estimate
the maximum power output of the TG solar still, an external resistor (10 Ω) close to the internal
resistance of the TG series (10.64 Ω) was connected. The circuit resistance was calculated using
the method proposed by Tsang et al. (Thevenin equivalent resistance),68 which afforded a
maximum power output of 1.32 W (Figure 6D).

After measuring the power output, the resistor was removed, and a fan was connected
to the circuit. The fan can be operated without the buck-boost converter and was tested by
connecting the terminals on the fan directly to the protruding wires of the TG solar still
(Supplementary video 2). Reconnecting the buck-boost converter and connecting the circuit to
a USB-C cord, the TG solar still can charge a cell phone, albeit at a slower rate compared to a
home electrical outlet (Supplementary videos 3 & 4). This demonstrates the expanded utility of
the solar still for powering small devices onboard such as sensors or for quality monitoring.
The combination of desalination and thermoelectric generation has gained interest in the field,
with many reports of lab-scale thermoelectric generation using simulated sunlight.56,57,66–68 This

however is the first example reported of a scaled up floating solar still to incorporate
thermoelectric generation for real world utility.
3. Conclusions
The TiC NPs based solar still presented herein has been shown to generate freshwater
from Atlantic Ocean at the highest productivity for a floating solar still reported to date. This
marks a promising method of converting waste tire rubber into a value-added product for highly
environmentally friendly solar desalination. The still design, matched with the high
photothermal efficiency of the TiC coating, allows for such efficient desalination. The still can
generate freshwater at a rate of 3.67 L m-2 day-1 corresponding to a solar efficiency of up to
40%. This efficiency remains over time when deployed in the ocean with waves, currents, wind,
and sediment to deal with. The TMC still effectively resists microbe growth and decreases all
tested ions by 3-5 orders of magnitude. In both cases the collected water is far below levels set
by Health Canada and the WHO, both of which have some of the strictest guidelines worldwide.
The still is also highly cost effective, producing water with a CPL as low as 0.5 ¢ L-1 over the
lifetime of the still, with repayment in only 290 days in Halifax, Canada. This makes the still
the most cost effective floating still to date and is very competitive with many top performing
land stills. Finally, thermoelectrically harvesting the remaining waste heat, the still provides a
peak power generation of 1.32 W, while maintaining a desalination efficiency of 33% in the
middle of winter. The efficient heat generation of the TiC NPs benefits from the very cold ocean
water below to reach such high electricity generation. The power generated is sufficient to run
fans, and even charge a phone which highlights the potential utility for onboard electrics that
might be needed.

umbrella (0.8 m diameter), magnets, and Woods™ camp shower (5 L) were purchased from
Canadian Tire. Solar intensity was measured using a TenMars TM-206 digital pyranometer.
Wind speed, humidity, and outdoor ambient temperature were measured using a Kestrel 3000
pocket weather meter. All condition data was compared with data from Environment and
Climate Change Canada for Halifax Shearwater (coordinates: 44°38'06.7" N 63°31'32.1" W).
During evaporation experiments, temperatures within the still were monitored using either a
Perfect Prime IR0005 or a K-type thermocouple. Akozon 40x40 mm semiconductor
thermoelectric power generator modules (SP1848-27415) and the buck-boost power converter
(Kananana 1.2-24 V step-up, step-down) were purchased from Amazon. The TEG generated
voltage and current were measured using a digital multimeter (VSense U1233A).
4.2 Characterization Techniques
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected using a Proto AXRD®
Benchtop with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Powders were packed into a sample well of a
resin holder. Absorbance and reflectance spectra were recorded on an Agilent CARY 5000 UVVis-NIR spectrometer. For liquid absorbance measurements, dispersions were placed into a
18

quartz cuvette, and the spectrometer was background corrected using deionized water. For film
samples, an external diffuse reflectance accessory with a 150 mm integrating sphere was used.
The instrument was used in double beam mode using reduced slit height and was standard
calibrated using a zero/baseline correction. Absorbance values were calculated from reflectance
data using the following equation:
𝐴 = (1 − 𝑅) 𝑥 100%
where A and R are absorbance and the measured reflectance, respectively. There is no
transmission through the interfaces so it can be disregarded. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4700 electron microscope. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a FEI TechaniTM 12 electron microscope with an
accelerating voltage of 120 kV. TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting nanoparticle
suspensions onto a 200-mesh carbon coated copper grid. The images were analyzed using
ImageJ software. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were
performed on a Thermo Scientific X-Series 2 spectrometer and the standards were obtained
from SCP Science.
4.3 Synthesis of Tire Char
Biochar synthesis was adapted from a previously reported anaerobic pyrolysis process.58
Briefly, waste tire rubber was ground into a fine crumb, and subsequently pyrolyzed at 500 °C
for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling to ~100 °C, the reaction mixture was quenched
in cold deionized water. The water was then heated to boiling for 10 minutes. The biochar was
collected via filtration and the solid product was washed with water until the filtrate ran clear.
The resulting biochar was dried and finely ground using a mortar and pestle, followed by
sieving to ≤ 250 µm. The sieved biochar was then added to a beaker equipped with a magnetic
stir-bar and reacted with concentrated HNO3 for 30 minutes. Afterwards, the reaction was

19

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-dhl01 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

filtered, and the acid-treated biochar was rinsed with deionized water until the filtrate was
neutral. The biochar was dried in an oven at 100 °C for 2 days.
4.4 Synthesis of TiC NPs
Titanium carbide NPs were prepared according to a previously reported procedure.59
Briefly, in a nitrogen filled glovebox, 1.0 g of the corresponding metal oxide (TiO2 ZrO2, or
HfO2) was mixed with waste tire char (0.30 g) and magnesium (1.20 g) powders using a mortar
and pestle until a homogenous mixture was obtained. The mixture was transferred to a stainlesssteel combustion boat and placed into a quartz tube. After purging with argon gas for 15 min in
a Lindberg Blue MTM furnace, the mixture was heated to 950 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min-1
and held for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and transferred
to a glass beaker. 6.0 M HCl (20 mL) was added to the reaction product and was sonicated for
1 hour. Carbides were washed in distilled water (3 x 10 mL) by sonication, centrifugation, and
pouring off the supernatant each time. After the third wash, the NPs were filtered and rinsed
with acetone, followed by ethanol, then dried in an oven.
4.5 Preparation of TiC NP Evaporation Interface
The TiC evaporation interface was prepared by spray-coating under vacuum using a setup
built in house (Figure S6). A given volume of 0.1 g mL-1 solution of TiC NPs was sprayed onto
a 65 cm diameter polyester filter (McMaster-Carr, 10 µm) to give a particle loading of 1.0 g m2

. The interface was then allowed to air dry to increase adsorption of the NPs to the filter. The

total evaporation area for use with the solar still is 0.33 m2.
4.6 Preparation of Solar Still
EVA foam (2.5 cm thick) was cut into an 80 cm diameter disc, and 3 mm holes (i.e. 68
in total) were drilled through the foam to cover 2.5% of the total surface area. Absorbent cotton
(Zorb®) was rolled into 3 mm wicks and inserted into each hole. An additional ring of EVA
20

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-dhl01 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

foam (2.5 x 2.5 cm, 78.5 cm inner diameter) was cut and adhered to the foam base to elevate a
freshwater wick that circled the outer part of the foam support (main article, Figure 2). To
further avoid splashing of water onto the collection wick, stainless steel strapping (5 cm x 3mm)
was inserted upright into the foam around the circumference of the solar still (Figure S14). A 6
mm hole was drilled through the center of the foam support to insert the condensation dome,
which was further secured by adding magnetic snaps around the outside of the frame. The net
weight of the solar still is 1.5 kg.
4.7 Rooftop Desalination Experiment
The TiC solar still was floated in a 1.5 m diameter pool that was filled with water taken
from the Halifax Harbour (latitude: 44° 36' 59.99" N, longitude: -63° 32' 59.99" W). Tested
started at 7:00 each testing day and ran until 21:00, with water being continuously collected.
Water was collected through the outlet tube into a glass container and the amount collected was
measured hourly. Solar intensity, ambient and solar still surface temperature, and wind speed
were also recorded hourly.
4.8 Harbour Desalination Experiment
The TiC solar still was floated directly in the Halifax Harbour (latitude: 44° 36' 59.99" N,
longitude: -63° 32' 59.99" W), starting at 7:00 and ending at 21:00. Water was continuously
collected through the outlet tube into a modified Woods™ brand camping shower, designed to
be watertight. The amount of water collected was measured at the end of the day. The solar still
was tied off to a post to prevent it from drifting. Solar intensity, ambient and solar still surface
temperature, and wind speed were also recorded hourly.
4.9 ATP Assay Measurements
ATP measurements were taken using the LUMINULTRA ATP test kit QuenchGone™
Aqueous (QGA). For analysis, the samples were collected in sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes and
21

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-dhl01 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

inverted prior to analysis to ensure complete cellular dispersion. Samples were passed over a
0.45 µm syringe filter to retain all biomass in the filter. An elution reagent was poured into the
filter to breakdown cells and liberate ATP. The filtrate was collected into a dilution tube and
was then mixed with the luminase enzyme. The prepared sample was placed into a luminometer
to obtain the relative light units (RLU) of cellular ATP. The RLU is proportional to the amount
of biomass present in the sample. For the lab scale desalination only 2 replicates were performed,
while for the harbour water and solar still analysis was done 3 times. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4700 electron microscope. Inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were performed on a Thermo
Scientific X-Series 2 spectrometer and the standards were obtained from SCP Science.
4.10 Dye Studies
For dye studies, 3.0 mM stock solutions were made by adding 0.3 mmol of either
methylene blue (MB) or rhodamine B (RhB) to 100 mL of deionized H2O. TiC evaporation
interfaces were floated on the stock solutions inside a closed quartz vessel with a sloped cover
to recondense water vapor. Water samples were taken from the collection side of the vessel and
the absorbance was tested by UV Vis. To monitor the concentration of the stock solution during
evaporation, aliquots were taken at the designated times (5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes).
After UV Vis analysis, the sample was added back to the vessel and deionized water was added
to maintain the overall water level. Blank experiments were run to determine how much of the
dyes were being taken up by the evaporation interface.
