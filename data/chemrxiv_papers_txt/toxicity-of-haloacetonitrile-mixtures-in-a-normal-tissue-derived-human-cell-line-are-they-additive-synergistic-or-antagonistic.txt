ABSTRACT

18

Haloacetonitriles (HANs), a class of nitrogen-containing disinfection by-products found in

19

treated drinking water, are cytotoxic and genotoxic to mammalian cells. However, most cell

20

toxicity data has been ascertained using transformed or cancer-derived animal and human cell

21

lines with an ambiguous relevance to human health. In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity

22

of individual chloro-, bromo-, and iodo-acetonitrile (ClCH2CN, BrCH2CN, and ICH2CN) and

23

their mixtures using normal tissue-derived human epithelium-derived RPE-1hTERT cells. The

24

order for individual HAN cytotoxicity from most to least toxic was

ICH2CN>BrCH2CN>>ClCH2CN with the inhibitory concentration that reduced the cell viability

26

by 50% of the untreated cells (IC50) of 3.0, 8.7, and 219.8 µM, respectively. For HAN mixtures

27

cytotoxicity from most to least toxic was

N with IC50 of 8.9, 9.9, 10.1 and 17.8 µM, respectively. The cytotoxicity of

30

ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN was well predicted by both concentration addition (CA) and independent

31

action (IA) models. The CA model overestimated the toxicity of the other three mixtures which

32

indicates an antagonistic effect with a model deviation ratio of less than 2. The IA model

33

predicted the cytotoxicity of BrCH2CN+ICH2CN and ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN+ICH2CN slightly

34

better than the CA model. According to the Chou-Talalay method, all binary mixtures showed

35

strong antagonistic cytotoxic effects, particularly at low concentrations. However, binary

36

mixtures with ClCH2CN had a slight synergistic effect at high concentrations.

INTRODUCTION

44

Water disinfection is one of the most important public health advances of the 20th century,

45

significantly reducing waterborne diseases, including typhoid and cholera.1 However, chemical

46

disinfectants and UV light may react with organic matter and other components in source waters

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cpwfd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-0855 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

47

to unintentionally form disinfection by-products (DBPs).2,3 Additionally, source waters with

48

nitrogen-containing compounds may react with disinfectants to form nitrogen-containing DBPs

49

(N-DBPs).4-13 Haloacetonitriles (HANs) are among of the most frequently detected and abundant

50

class of N-DBPs8,13⎯up to a HAN total of 41 µg/L in drinking water⎯and were identified as

51

major drivers for overall toxicity in disinfected drinking waters.14 Although HANs are not

52

regulated, the World Health Organization has maximum concentration guidelines for

53

dichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile of 20 and 70 µg/L,15,16 respectively; these were

54

included in the Fifth Contaminant Candidate List’ by the U.S. Environmental Protection

55

Agency.17

56

The toxicity of individual HANs has been studied extensively in vitro. HANs are reported to

57

be 1-2 orders of magnitude more cytotoxic and genotoxic to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells

58

relative to regulated DBPs.18,19 Comparable HAN cytotoxicity outcomes have also been reported

59

in human-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2),20 protozoa (Tetrahymena pyriformis),

60

bacteria (Vibrio fischeri, Salmonella typhimurium), and budding yeast (Saccharomyces

61

cerevisiae). 21-23 However, characterization of mixed exposure effects of HANs is important

62

because, in practice, humans are exposed to DBP as mixtures, and rarely (if ever) as single

63

agents.24,25 To predict overall water toxicity, several studies have used the largest database of in

64

vitro DBP toxicity data based on CHO cells19 and computed toxicity values based on the

65

assumption that combined effects of DBP mixtures are additive.6,9,11,26-28 A recent study showed

66

that the assumption is valid for the cytotoxicity of CHO cells; however, these cells may differ

67

substantially from human cells.29 Additive toxicity was also observed for 38 DBPs tested using

68

reporter gene assays in one human cell line and one bacterial assay.30 HANs were observed to

69

dominate the overall water toxicity of these mixtures29,30; however, mixtures of di-HANs have

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cpwfd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-0855 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

70

shown antagonistic effects in a human cancer cell line.20 These contradicting results indicate the

71

need for further systematic and well controlled study, particularly for HAN mixtures and using

72

normal tissue-derived human cell line, which might better predict their impact on the health of

73

human cells.

74

Different models have been used to evaluate cumulative toxic effects of DBP mixtures. The

75

most commonly used methods in environmental studies are concentration addition (CA), and

76

independent action (IA).30-34 However, when toxicity is over- or under-estimated, it is difficult to

77

quantify the level of antagonism or synergism. The Chou-Talalay combination index is one of the

78

most commonly used calculations to evaluate the effects of combining two compounds and can

79

address some of the shortcomings of the CA and IA models.35-37 The Chou-Talalay dose-effect

80

analysis is performed based on the mass-action law-based theory where the “median” is a

81

common link between single and multiple entities.38 Most recently, studies have applied the

82

Chou-Talalay method to study the combined effects of DBPs on embryos of Platynereis

83

dumerilii and bacteria (E. Coli and Vibrio qinghaiensis sp.-Q67).31,39,40

84

Given the knowledge gap concerning the effects of HAN mixtures in a normal tissue-derived

85

human cell line, the objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the cytotoxicity of individual

86

monoHANs and their mixtures to a normal tissue-derived human cell line, (2) determine the

87

combined cytotoxicity of monoHANs using the Chou-Talalay method and compare it to other

88

commonly used models. Identifying the type of toxic interactions among unregulated HANs may

89

help improve the safety of treated water.

Reagents and solutions. Reagents and solution preparation are detailed in Text S1 in
Support Information (SI).

94

Cell culture. Human cell line RPE-1hTERT was obtained from ATCC (#CRL-4000) and

95

maintained in DMEM: F12 (Gibco #11330–032) containing 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum and

96

0.01 mg/mL Hygromycin B (Sigma, #10687010) at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified

97

atmosphere. Cells were subcultured every two days and were only used for no more than 24

98

passages.

99

Cytotoxicity. The reduction of cell viability was measured using the alamarBlue cell

100

viability assay. AlamarBlue assay measures the reducing environment of the living cell and may

101

signify an impairment of cellular metabolism.41 The protocol used in this study was adopted

102

from the Thermofisher’s alamarBlue assay protocol (alamarBlue® Assay-U.S. Patent No.

103

5,501,959) with slight modifications as described in Text S2 in SI. Each experiment had 6

104

internal replicates and was repeated in triplicate on 3 different days. Altogether, each treatment

105

had 18 replicates. All combinations and individual cytotoxicity testing were performed on the

106

same day to minimize variations. Cell viability was calculated as the mean percentage of the

107

negative control. Statistical analysis of the data is described in Text S3 in SI. Cell growth was

108

also monitored throughout the treatment and described in Text S4 in SI.

109

Cytotoxicity of HAN mixtures. To evaluate the cumulative toxicity effects of HAN

110

mixtures, binary and tertiary combinations of chloroacetonitrile (ClCH2CN), bromoacetonitrile

111

(BrCH2CN), and iodoacetonitrile (ICH2CN) were prepared by mixing monoHANs in equal

112

concentrations (1:1 and 1:1:1). The total concentration of HAN mixtures ranged between 0.1-100

113

µM. Dose-response curves from HAN mixtures were analyzed with CA, 30,42,43 IA,44 model

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

118

Cytotoxic effects of individual HANs. MonoHANs were previously reported by our

119

research group to be stable in cell culture media for three days at 37°C and 5% CO2,46 whereas

120

the di- and tri-substituted HANs degraded rapidly within this same time frame. To minimize

121

confounding effects from HAN degradation products, RPE-1hTERT cells were exposed to

122

monoHANs and evaluated for cytotoxicity. RPE-1hTERT cells were used because they are a

123

normal-tissue derived and have a stable genome with a model chromosome number of 46 that

124

makes them widely-used epithelial cell model to study DNA damage.47 Dose-response curves for

125

ClCH2CN, BrCH2CN, and ICH2CN are shown in Figure 1a. Cell viability was reduced in a dose-

126

dependent manner, where ClCH2CN was the least potent, followed by BrCH2CN and ICH2CN as

127

the most potent. The calculated inhibitory concentration that reduced cell viability by 50% (IC50)

128

for ClCH2CN, BrCH2CN, and ICH2CN were 220 µM, 8.68 µM, and 3.00 µM, respectively. The

129

order of monoHAN potency observed in this study agrees with those reported in CHO cells,

130

protozoa (T. pyriformis), bacteria (V. fischeri), and yeast (S. cerevisiae).21-23 For CHO cells,

131

ICH2CN had a similar IC50 values (3.30 µM) to our study. However, ClCH2CN (68.3 µM) and

132

BrCH2CN (3.21 µM) were more potent in CHO cells than in RPE-1hTERT cells.18 Another study

133

also found that BrCH2CN is more potent than ClCH2CN to HepG2 with IC50 values of 7 µM and

134

734 µM, respectively.20

135

While the alamarBlue assay measures viable cell capacity to reduce resazurin (non-

136

fluorescent and blue color) to resorufin and dihydroresorufin (fluorescent and red color), it does

137

not measure cell growth.48 For that reason, the impact of HANs on cell growth was evaluated

138

separately(Figure S1 in SI). Cell growth rate was impacted for all compounds and at all

139

concentrations tested, in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest two concentrations showing

140

robust cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. These results corroborate the effects observed for the

141

alamarBlue assay (Figure 1a-g).

142
143

Cytotoxic effect of HAN mixtures. In disinfected waters, HANs exist as mixtures.

144

Therefore, the combined effect of binary and tertiary mixtures of HANs on a human cell line was

145

evaluated between 0.1-100 µM ⎯a range of concentrations that RPE-1hTERT cells are viable at

146

individual exposures (Figure 1a). Dose-response curves for each monoHAN are shown in Figure

147

1a and each is presented together for comparison with its respective mixtures in Figure 1b-d. IC50

148

values for mixtures (1:1 and 1:1:1) ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN, ClCH2CN+ICH2CN,

149

BrCH2CN+ICH2CN, and ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN+ICH2CN were 17.8, 10.1, 9.0 and 9.91 µM

150

respectively. For BrCH2CN (Figure 1c) and ICH2CN (Figure 1d), addition of any other HAN

151

attenuated the toxicity of either monoHAN; this attenuation is greatest when BrCH2CN or

152

ClCH2CN is mixed with ICH2CN. However, mixtures with ClCH2CN (Figure 1b) were markedly

153

more toxic than ClCH2CN alone, but only at higher concentrations well beyond what is found in

154

disinfected waters.8,13 This reflects the impact of compounds with greater potency (BrCH2CN

155

and ICH2CN) on one with lesser potency (ClCH2CN). These observations contradict to a study

156

that reported additive toxic effects in V. fischeri from binary mixtures of monoHANs, which

157

could be attributed to the difference in combination ratios applied.22 Dawson et al. used a relative

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cpwfd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-0855 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

158

potency ratio of ICH2CN: BrCH2CN (1:1.22),22 whereas in our study we used an equalmolar

159

ratios of (1:1 and 1:1:1). Moreover, the intracellular reaction of HANs with components of

160

different cell medium and metabolites, cellular enzymes and other proteins of different test

161

organisms or cellular models might vary. Further study is needed using equipotent ratios to

162

evaluate the cumulative cytotoxic effect of monoHAN mixtures. RPE-1hTERT cells treated with

163

HAN mixtures (Figure S1d-g in SI) also exhibited similar cell growth/inhibition patterns as the

164

RPE-1hTRET cells treated with individual monoHANs (Figure S1a-c in SI) except for the 10 µM

165

ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN mixture which slowed cell growth but not cell death.

166

The combined cytotoxicity effect of the monoHAN mixtures was evaluated with the CA and

167

IA models. Results for ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN (Figure 2a) agree with the IA and CA models. The

168

MDR compares the deviation of the experimental data with each model and the IC50 were

169

calculated to be 1.05 and 1.00 for CA and IA, respectively. These results show that the data are

170

well predicted by both models. However, for mixtures containing ICH2CN (Figure 2b-d), the CA

171

model overestimates toxicity (most conservative) and the IA model underestimates the

172

experimental toxicity data. The MDR for the CA model for ClCH2CN+ICH2CN,

173

BrCH2CN+ICH2CN, and ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN+ICH2CN mixtures at IC50 were 0.55, 0.52, and

174

0.66, respectively. These results show that the measured toxicity of the mixture is less toxic than

175

expected and the combined toxic effects were borderline antagonistic and observed in Figure 1.

176

Results from this study also agree with Lu et al. who they measured and evaluated the toxicity of

177

binary and tertiary mixtures of dichloro-, dibromo-, and trichloro-acetonitrile with the CA and IA

178

models.20 The dichloro- and dibromo-acetonitrile mixture had a better match with IA than CA,

179

and all other mixtures with trichloroacetonitrile showed antagonistic effects. However, the MDR

180

at IC5 (low concentration) for all mixtures was between 0.64-1.17 and seem to be well predicted

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cpwfd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-0855 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

181

by the CA model. This result is particularly important because HANs are typically present in

182

disinfected waters at low concentrations with individual maximum concentrations between 0.2-

183

12 µg/L.8,13 The MDR for the IA model for ClCH2CN+ICH2CN, BrCH2CN+ICH2CN, and

184

ClCH2CN+BrCH2CN+ICH2CN mixtures at IC50 were 2.57, 1.66, and 1.05, respectively. These

185

results suggest that with the exception of ClCH2CN+ICH2CN the mixtures are reasonably well

186

predicted by the IA model.

187

CA and IA models have limitations. These models assume that individual components do not

188

interact with each other.49,50 For the IA model, the assumption that components of the mixture

189

act independently may not be accurate for a large proportion of chemical interactions. 51,52 Also,

190

for the CA model to be valid, dose-response curves should have constant potency ratios (parallel

191

log dose-response curves indicating constant potency ratios).53,54 In nature, having parallel dose-

192

response curves for each mixture component is infrequent.55 Furthermore, the CA model requires

193

accurately generated dose-response curves for each component in the mixture, which is

194

impractical for combinations with a larger number of components.55 In addition, for the IA model

195

to hold, it must be applicable along the entire dose response curve.54

196

The Chou-Talalay method was used to evaluate the combined effects of monoHANs and

197

results were compared with the experimental observations. This method does not require a

198

constant potency ratio among the individual components. Using the potency and the shape of the

199

dose-response curve for individual compounds, the Chou-Talalay method can simulate combined

200

effects at different concentrations and response levels of the chemicals in the mixture. All four

201

mixtures had log(CI) values greater than 0 at fa=0.5 (IC50), 0.75 (IC75), and 0.9 (IC90), as shown

202

in Figure 3. These results indicate that HAN mixture concentrations up to fa≤0.95 have

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cpwfd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-0855 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

203

antagonistic effects on cell growth or viability. For example, at IC5 the log(CI) values were

204

between 0.7-1.22, which indicates strong to very strong antagonism. These results differ to the

205

CA model and MDR, which suggested that these mixtures are additive at IC5. This could be

206

partially because of the limitations of the CA model that assumes analytes do not interact with

207

each other and the range considered to be “additive” between the CA and IA models and the

208

Chou-Talalay models do not necessarily overlap. For binary mixtures, it can be observed that

209

with increasing HAN concentration the curve approached log(CI)→0 which indicates that the

210

combined effects of HANs shift from strong antagonism to nearly additive. However, these

211

combined effects occur at high HAN concentrations which are not necessarily environmentally

212

relevant. Moreover, it was observed that as the mixture combinations changed from binary to

213

tertiary, the interaction of HANs for a given percent of effect tended to approach additivity.

214

Although these results require further study and confirmation with mixtures with higher number

215

of DBPs or at potency ratios, it agrees with previous studies that have observed an additive

216

combined effect of multicomponent DBP mixtures.29,33 Overall, the Chou-Talalay method seems

217

to better portray the combined toxic effects observed in experiments.

218

IMPLICATIONS

219

To our knowledge, this is the first study that has systematically evaluated the individual and

220

combined cytotoxic effects of monoHANs in a normal tissue-derived human cell model.

221

According to the Chou-Talalay method, binary and tertiary mixtures of monoHANs act

222

antagonistically when present together, especially in environmentally relevant, low

223

concentrations (<12 µg/L). However, the CA model and MDR showed that the combined effect

224

of mixtures is additive. The differences could be related to the assumption of the CA model that

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cpwfd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-0855 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

225

mixture analytes do not act with each other and the MDR and CI values of each model do not

226

necessarily overlap. The Chou-Talalay method also suggested that with increasing number of

227

DBPs the combined toxicity approach additivity however, this needs to be tested with mixtures

228

with higher number of DBPs. This study showed that monoHAN present as mixtures have lower

229

toxicity than those reported individually which should be taken into consideration when

230

estimating overall water toxicity of disinfected waters.
