Enhanced weathering (EW) is a CO2 removal (CDR) and sequestration strategy that accelerates the
natural reactions of minerals that can store carbon from the atmosphere and biotic reactions. One method
of EW is to apply finely ground silicate rocks to agricultural lands. EW has been demonstrated in
laboratory and field tests, but great uncertainty remains regarding the life-cycle of using locally available
rocks on candidate soils. We evaluate the life-cycle impacts, job creation, and cost of scenarios where
fines and rocks mined from quarries in Oregon and Northern California are transported by truck and tilled
into agricultural soils. Candidate quarry dust samples were classified as dacite, andesite, and olivinebearing rocks, with EW potentials ranging from 125-760 kg CO2/metric tonne rock. We determined the
olivine-bearing rock from Southern Oregon could achieve a levelized cost of CDR under the DOE
Earthshot target of $100/t CO2, as long as application rates are 25 t/ha or more. Even andesite and dacite
materials reach lower costs than commercial direct air capture technologies, with reduction in fines
purchase and transport costs critical for achieving the Earthshot target. The results suggest that low-cost
EW can be achieved using natural quarry materials, with average removal up to 2.2 t CO2e per hectare per
year.

Silicate rocks rich in base cations such as magnesium and calcium can react with carbonic acid and
sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) as solid carbonates (the process of carbonation) or dissolved bicarbonate
that eventually is exported to oceans to contribute to ocean alkalinity (the process of enhanced
weathering: EW).1,2 These processes occur naturally, but can in theory be replicated using engineered
pathways to remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere over time scales relevant to the
climate crisis.

Potential global carbon removal by way of land-based EW (i.e. surficial EW) has been estimated based on
the availability of silicate rocks with low silica-content, such as ultramafic and mafic rocks.3,4 In landbased EW, rocks are ground to fine particle size and spread on soils or beaches to sequester CO2 from the
atmosphere ex situ. Basalts are frequently used in EW studies, and are abundant mafic rock with high
concentrations of minerals that weather relatively quickly, including Ca-Mg Pyroxenes, Ca-Plagioclase,
and sometimes olivine. Estimates of lower-bound cost for land-based EW range from $20-200/t CO2
removal,2,5–7 suggesting both the potential to achieve the United States Department of Energy “Earthshot”
levelized cost target of $100/t CO2 removal, as well as significant sensitivities to material composition
and modeling assumptions. A levelized cost is a performance metric that accounts for capital and
operating expenditures over a project lifespan. These recent studies have brought attention to EW as a
decarbonization pathway, but raise questions regarding both the fundamental geochemical processes
driving weathering rates and the economic potential of using local quarry rocks.

Geochemical studies use specific chemical compositions to represent rock samples, and therefore lean
towards endmember minerals. One endmember of olivine is forsterite (Fo: Mg2SiO4) which is not easily
found in pure form, but represents a theoretical optimal model mineral. For example, pot studies aimed at
understanding the effects of EW on crop growth and nutrient uptake use a Fo dominated olivine.8
Wollastonite (CaSiO3) is another mineral used to represent silicate weathering.9 Weathering and
carbonation of Fo can be calculated using Equation (1) and (2); not shown is the reaction of CO2 and
water to carbonic acid.

In reality, candidate rocks contain a range of minerals, which leads to complex and non-idealized
reactions, necessitating mesocosm studies and field trials using locally available quarry materials to verify
performance. Some rock types typically ignored in EW literature are now being discussed and used in
California EW pilots,10 including aggregate fines and mine tailings.11 In Northern California, EW tests are
being performed with a material labeled “meta-basalt” from Later Jurassic volcanic units from an
aggregate quarry in Ione, California, which we classify herein as dacite.12 Due to its higher silica
concentration, dacite does not continue olivine series minerals but still contains pyroxenes and
plagioclase, although in lower amounts than basalts, and therefore has various degrees of EW potential.
Recent advancements in the measurement and simulation of weathering kinetics, and associated
processes, including experiments conducted by some of the authors on dacite fines from the same
aggregate provider in Northern California, have shed light on factors affecting CO2 removal.3,13 Example

factors include proper soil selection, and adequate tilling into soils to ensure particles are exposed to the
soil and to potentially introduce more air and thus atmospheric CO2.13 However, understanding the
environmental impacts and cost of deploying a local rock on appropriate nearby agriculture land with
tilling requires an understanding of the full life-cycle of EW projects at meaningful and realistic
deployment scales. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of land-based EW exist, including a study on the use of
materials from new basalt quarries in Brazil.14 That study provided valuable insights on key sources of
emissions, including identification of cutoff distances for diesel transportation of rock to field. Other
environmental evaluations consider idealized rocks,15,16 or simply apply cost and emissions values from
previous literature without bottom-up modeling. No framework existed for explicit bottom-up models of
life-cycle processes or the coupling with an economic analysis, particularly in a northern-hemisphere
economy, until Zhang and colleagues.14,17 In that study, representative capture potentials reflecting
possible rock fines and sands from copper mines are used (0.2-1.1 t CO2/t rock), with supply chains
modeled as barge and truck transport to agriculture lands in the Midwest U.S. Life cycle capture potential
of 225-1020 kg CO2e/t material was estimated at costs ranging from $45-472/net t CO2e removal. With
few exceptions,17,18 cost estimates are rarely conducted alongside LCA, which limits the ability to adjust
levelized cost $/t CO2 removal to $/net t CO2e removal.

This work builds on previous LCA14 and economic analysis7 by developing more detailed bottom-up
models of key life-cycle processes for a large EW deployment project in Northern California. We
leverage information from an existing 40 hectare pilot project in the area operated by the University of
California Office of the President Working Lands Innovation Center (WLIC),12 and assume a deployment
at the scale of 100,000 tonnes of olivine-bearing rock, dacite or andesite fines, or “produced-for-purpose”
olivine-bearing quarry rock on 900 hectares of cropland within 80, 447, or 1037 km in 30 years. Theses
distances are trucking route distances going from regional quarries where samples were collected to the
WLIC agriculture area. Application is capped at 111 t per hectare (45 t/acre), while the frequency of
application is limited based on rock dissolution rate and land management practices. As such, necessary
annual production of rock material varies across scenarios included in this study, but is expected to be less
than ~4% output of a medium-size aggregate quarry with an annual output of 450,000 tonnes. We
approach EW from the perspective of an EW company that partners with an existing aggregate quarry,
where the EW company is responsible for the purchase, staffing and operation of necessary comminution
equipment that is unlikely to already be at aggregate mines for the produced-for-purpose materials, front
loaders, highway suitable truck fleets, and tractors. If the EW company does not purchase the equipment,
it is reasonable to expect a specialized starting material to have a higher upfront cost. We discuss the use
of mine tailings that could potentially be freely available for use in section 3.6.

The novelty of this work lies in the coupling of the LCA with the economic analysis, but more
importantly the use of current local rocks from aggregate quarries including those that have been
overlooked in literature such as andesite and dacite, and the bottom-up modeling of key processes
including the effect of particle size and weathering rates on life-cycle processes that are time dependent
and allow for estimates of labor. While job creation ultimately varies throughout the lifespan of a project
and by business, there are methods to bound potential job creation and quality. Herein, we use an
equivalent equipment module approach, where job creation, salary and type are determined based on
location, equipment type and shift requirements. These contributions provide much needed data on the
potential for scaling enhanced weathering.

affecting life cycle cost and greenhouse gas emissions. Variables include the loss of ultrafine particles
prior to land application, energy sources, transportation requirements, field application rate affected by

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The LCA follows the ISO 14040 and 14044 standard structure, which includes goal and scope definition,
Life-Cycle Inventory (LCI) development, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and results interpretation,
as detailed in the following sections. Bottom-up modeling was used to represent key sub-processes in the
LCI, while background data for quarry blasting was generated using both the United States Life Cycle
Inventory (USLCI) and ecoinvent3.2 databases.19 Calculations were performed in OpenLCA2.0 to
convert CO2, CH4, and N2O into CO2eq based on global warming potentials (GWP), and to convert other
emissions including nitrogen oxides (NOx), SO2, and particulate matter (PM2.5) into impacts of
importance (see ESI for details). We used the GWP results of the LCA in our cost analysis to obtain
levelized cost of carbon removal ($/net t CO2e removed).
2.1 System Boundary.
The system boundary of the LCA and cost analysis includes flows of capital, labor, and operation
materials and energy for the following processes for produced-for-purpose olivine-bearing rock: material
extraction at the quarry, material transport within the quarry to the grinding facility, material grinding
with ball milling, material transportation to fields on public roads, and material loading and spreading on
fields by diesel tractor and till. The flow of processes at the mine follow the suggested operation pathway
proposed in Renforth 2012 (see Figure 520 for flow path of materials during comminution). For existing
by-products of quarries such as fines, we only account for material collection, transport and application.
The functional units are one tonne of rock material applied, and one tonne of net-CO2eq removed.
Total allowable application rates vary in literature, but we assumed 111 t material/ha over the project
lifetime, and explore the impact of scenarios where only 1 mm thickness of material application is
allowed per pass. Single applications for EW experiments have been relatively low (e.g. 3 t/ha)9 while
analysis have evaluated application rates from 2-494 t/ha, with base cases around 40-111 t/ha.7 A single
pass of 111 tonnes at a base case bulk density of 1800 kg/m3 would result in a thickness of 6.19 mm. As
such, the project area could be treated in ~6 passes in 6 years and 3 months if the annual dissolution rate
is 100%. For a project deploying 100,000 tonnes of rock material locally on 900 hectares of treatable area,
the maximum rock material required annually would be 16,155 tonnes, which is ~3-4% of the output of a
medium sized quarry. As such, we do not consider the quarry to be dedicated to EW and do not attribute
any land use change in our analysis. In all cases, we assume a constant influx of fresh rock (and thus
constant CDR removal through weathering reactions) is applied as soon as the material is dissolved,
assuming each tractor pass applies 1 mm of material.
We select a study region around Davis, California, where land-based EW trials are currently ongoing.
Davis, California receives an average of 50 cm/yr of rainfall, and is in a region with plentiful silicate
rocks which bear high percentages of olivine deposits.12,21 We acquired a particle size analysis, mineral
analysis, and total elemental analysis for regional olivine-bearing rock samples from an unknown quarry
in Oregon, and local rock samples from Specialty Granules, Inc. in Ione, California, provided by the
WLIC. We classified samples using the Total Alkali Silica method to assist us in down selecting
representative rock compositions (see ESI for details). In regards to grinding, we assume olivine-bearing
rocks are not available as fines in California and thus must be processed down to a P80 of 0.179 mm,

which is the P80 of the local rock samples. P80 is the mesh size at which 80% of materials pass through.
Rocks applied on land are modeled as having uniform size, however in reality a size distribution is
generated and smaller particles which will have more rapid dissolution rates.

Region-specific ranges were identified for the following key parameters: (1) weathering performance
derived from CDR potential (Epot: g CO2 /g material), P80 (mm), Specific Surface Area (SSA: g/m2), and
dissolution rates based on SSA and location conditions; (2) supply chain conditions derived from fuel
price, electricity price, bulk density, land application load rate, land area treated, transportation distance,
and equipment capacity factors; (3) sources of Scope 2 and 3 emissions derived from fuel consumption
and electricity source (Table S2). We evaluated the impact of operational hours on overall job creation,
emissions and costs, as it is possible EW companies may operate seasonally or intermittently to align with
low cost, renewable electricity, or the availability of equipment.

2.2 Enhanced Weathering Model.
The EW or carbon removal potential (Epot) can be approximated for rocks with more complex
compositions, such as the rocks evaluated in this study (see section 3.1 for mineral classifications) based
on the major element concentrations expressed as oxides using Equation 3.22,23 This approach does not
account for reaction rates and simply estimates the contribution of each oxide to the divalent cations
leading to enhanced weathering and the formation of carbonates.

where respective elemental concentrations of oxides (wt-%) are divided by molecular mass (𝑀), and
multiplied by coefficients derived from Renforth 2019 for a pH of 7 (Table S1; note that 𝛾 and 𝛿 are
negative to account for phosphorus and sulfate minerals that decrease CDR). The molar ratio of CO2 to
cation transported to the ocean and sequestered (𝜂) is assumed to be 1 when only carbonation occurs and
2 when only EW occurs. Values between 1.4 and 1.7 are used for seawater, with 1.5 being the value used
in this study to account for buffering of current seawater systems.22 Uncertainties exist regarding the fate
of weathering products and the transport capacities of local hydrological systems such as surface waters.
Lefebvre and colleagues use a simplified equation with only CaO and MgO, and estimated carbonation
and EW potential of local basalt samples in Brazil to be 0.125 and 0.225 g CO2 per g basalt, respectively.
Other estimates use a value of 1.7 for 𝜂 for basalts and derive 0.3 g CO2 per g basalt.14 Bullock and
colleagues use Equation 3 to estimate a Epot of 0.938 g CO2 per g forsterite, data originally from Le
Maitre, 1982 which we use to represent forsterite.23,24
We adopt the method proposed by Strefler and colleagues7 to estimate the percentage of mineral
dissolved over the course of one year and to ensure adequate rainfall to facilitate reactions (Equation 4).
We selected a WR representative of forsterite at pH 7 and 25°C (10-9.86 mol/m2-s) and hold SSA constant
over time. There are limitations to this approach, as the relationship between WR, intrinsic particle
characteristics and field conditions such as crop selection, soil type, application approach, and climate are
poorly understood and difficult to derive from previous field and experimental trials.25 Furthermore, any

Olivine-bearing rocks in California are collected from quarry face blasting and transported a short
distance to primary, secondary, and tertiary crushers to first achieve an 80% pass size (P80) of <30 to <5
mm.20 Grinding via a ball mill further reduces particles to P80 <5 to <0.01 mm to achieve a rock
dust/flour. We model quarry blasting and loading of initial rock material using basalt production as a
representative process. Transport within the quarry is modeled assuming diesel lorries. Crushers and
grinders are operated on either renewable or local grid electricity. Capacity of the comminution
equipment was set at 30 tonnes per hour to reflect a common industrial size identified in vendor quotes.
The capacity of the comminution equipment is a critical uncertainty, as it affects plausible annual material
production. As 20% of the total material stream turns into fines at the quarry, we expect fines for andesite
and dacite to be readily available for purchase.20 While these fines may be perfectly suitable for EW, their
safe and effective collection and use for land application and ultimate weathering rates is an uncertainty in
the supply chain. Additional material may be lost during transport and storage, but that is not considered
herein.

where 𝑑(𝑥) is dissolution rate (%) for a given grain size x (µm), 𝑆𝑆𝐴(𝑥) is specific surface area in units
of m2 g-1 is estimated using Equation 5, WR is an SSA-based weathering rate in units of mole m-2 s-1, m is
the molecular mass in g mol-1 for the reference case and olivine-bearing rock, and , and 𝑡 is a conversion
from seconds to years. Molecular mass will vary by rock, but we use representative ranges identified for
rocks studied in the context of EW (see ESI for details).
Empirical analysis based on measurements of SSA over a range of grain sizes suggest SSA rapidly
increases with decreasing 𝑃80 (or grain size x; µm),7 with annual resulting dissolution rates of 100% or
higher only unlocked at 𝑃80 < 0.02 mm (Equation 5). This empirical approach developed for dunite by
Strefler and colleagues suggests 33% of the ideal forsterite particle at 0.05 mm is removed within a year,
while only 6.8% of our rock samples at 0.179 mm are removed. However, developing a robust correlation
at small grain sizes is complicated by the various methods in which particles were generated for
experiments, which may create different or poorly characterized particle shapes, porosity, and surface
roughness that affect active mineral surface. Notably, the sample meta-andesite has a particle size
distribution that leads to smaller particles and a significantly higher experimentally determined SSA than
what is estimated empirically using Equation 5. We provide further discussion of the impact of shape and
particle size on SSA in the ESI.

Diesel heavy duty dry bulk trailer trucks with a payload of 14.5 tonnes and average fuel consumption of
2.76 kilometers per liter (6.5 mpg; 60% greater fuel consumption when full)29 were assumed to be used to
transport the rock dust from the supplier to the field and return empty. Payloads of this size fall under
Class 7 and 8 trucks, and include vehicles such as dump trucks, refuse trucks, and truck tractors. Dry bulk
trailers are used around the world for the transport of powders for plastic production and other industries.
Roundtrip fuel consumption is therefore 3.26 liters diesel per tonne for the 80 km Ione quarry source
where the truck is fully loaded and returns empty. We estimated the number of trucks necessary based on
payload, a travel speed of 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph), 14 hour per day driver availability based on
regulations. For the Ione quarry, 22 trucks would be required if all rock materials were delivered in year
one. However, we assume materials are delivered each year a new application is performed, allowing for
only 1 truck purchase for a project with 6 application years. The one-way distance to quarries in Southern
and Northern Oregon was approximated as 447 km and 1037 km, respectively based on the geographic
distribution of olivine-bearing materials.21 Maintenance, registration fees, and tire replacement were
modeled based on data compiled by the American Transportation Research Institute.30

It was assumed a front loader is used for loading and hauling, and two diesel tractors are used for
dispensing rock dust on established agricultural land. A tractor for spray dispensing can treat on average
12 to 20 ha/engine-hour, while a tractor that plows or tills may treat 0.5 to 5 ha/engine-hour. We limit
daily work to 12 hours. We assumed minimal plowing or leveling is required, but to avoid dust formation
and to allow for some tilling, we conservatively chose an application rate of 2 hectares/engine-hour. The
fuel consumed for dispensing the rock dust was modeled as 11 L/ha based on an average fuel efficiency
of 86 L per engine-hour (23 L/hr). This is notably higher than fuel consumption for dispensing dry bulk
fertilizer of ~2 L/ha, which we use to account for the added power requirement of tilling.31 Fuel
consumption can increase by as much as 50% if the ground is not plowed at the start of the project. Fuel
consumption will also depend on the soil type, with sands and sandy loams requiring 35 to 40% less fuel,

Life-cycle costs for the project include all installed capital and operating expenditures over the active
project period, aligning with the time it takes to apply materials. The levelized cost of material application
($/t rock applied), converted to the levelized cost of net-carbon removal ($/net t CO2e) (Equation 7), was
determined based on the total rock applied over the course of the project. Capital costs are converted to
$2023 installed costs and annualized using a capital recovery factor approach recommended for energy

Costs associated with the quarry include the cost of the crushers and the ball mill for produced-forpurpose olivine-bearing rocks, the starting rock material, energy costs assuming diesel and local grid
electricity, maintenance costs assuming 10% of capital cost, and the cost of labor. All costs and impacts
of quarry operation are allocated based on the amount and frequency of material produced and delivered
for land application. Equipment and energy costs vary and are included in the sensitivity analysis, with
base values representative of current market prices in Oregon and California (Table S2).
Transportation includes the cost of fuel, the cost of the truck, truck maintenance, and labor. Labor is
estimated based on an 80 kmph travel speed and the roundtrip total miles traveled to deliver all rock
material to the fields (2 hours roundtrip per truckload from Ione and 11-26 hours from Oregon quarries,
distances and energy costs approximated using Menford and Baker City as low and high values).21 Labor
hours are then converted to truck hours per tonne based on the payload of the truck, which is then used to
estimate the number of trucks per project. Field application includes the cost of the tractor, tractor
maintenance assuming 10% of capital, and the cost of labor. Labor is estimated based on a tractor
covering 5 acres per hour, the number of passes required for application, and the land area treated (2,745
hours per project, see ESI for details).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Results of the life cycle impact and cost assessment of EW based on regional aggregate quarry fines and
possible produced-for-purpose rock materials are presented below.
3.1 Mineral Classification, CDR Performance, and Dissolution Rate.
Out of the rock fines samples analyzed, the olivine-bearing sample sourced from Oregon had a CDR
potential (Epot) of 760 kg CO2/t rock, matching what is expected of olivine rock, and therefore a prime
target for enhanced weathering.23 Two meta-andesite samples had CDR potentials over 150 kg CO2/ t
rock , while the dacite samples fell between 120 and 128 kg CO2/ t rock (Table 1). Major element oxide
concentrations were present in the rock samples, except for SO3, and FeO which was reported in the form
of Fe2O3. As summarized by Bullock et al, the presence of P and S bearing materials reduced CDR
potential, and high Al and Fe also reduced CDR potential depending on pH, as they form insoluble
secondary materials during the weathering process.23 The pure forsterite we use to benchmark fines
samples has an ultra-high CDR potential of 938 kg CO2/t rock .
Particle shapes with more surface and surface roughness than spheres, and particle porosity can increase
SSA (Figures S1).7 Doubling SSA for the same particle grain size would have a significant impact on
dissolution, with impacts on the same order of magnitude as temperature and pH (Figure S2).7 In general
our selection of SSA are low but result in predicted dissolution rates that match what we measure is
mesocosm studies. Measurements of SSA for forsterite are much higher in literature than what we
estimate empirically in this study (9.5 m2/g for forsterite with a P80 of 0.044 mm, compared with 0.54
m2/g at P80 of 0.05 mm). Furthermore, we experimentally measured an SSA of 2.23 m2/g for the metaandesite sample (compared with our empirical value of 0.11 m2/g at P80 of 0.179 mm).33 Using the upper
range of SSA values for samples along with our default WR in Equation 3 generates dissolution rates that
are far too high. So, even if we acknowledge using low SSA values, the resulting dissolution rates we
adopt in this study align with that seen in our field work. This suggests a major lack of correlation and
understanding regarding particle optimization and target dissolution, which may not be a concern on very
long time scales, but will be when working with land owners to identify acceptable application rates.

In this study, we fit a piecewise function to data on the energy required to achieve a target P80. This
required employing a step-shape function from 1000 mm through 5 mm, the Bond Work Law equation
between 5 mm and 0.03 mm, and a power function between 0.03 and 0.002 mm. Comminution

technologies consume large amounts of electricity when grinding to ultrafine particle sizes (< 0.01 to 0.02
mm) (Figure 2). Estimated energy to go from quarry to a final particle size of 0.179 mm is 23 kWh/t
material. This is the same estimate as that reported by Huijgen and Comans.34 Energy requirements to
reduce quarry materials down to P80 5 mm vary from ~12 to 20 kWh/t in literature. Estimates more than
double by just P80 of 0.06 mm, and increase exponentially beyond P80 0.01 mm. Our approach yields
lower energy intensities for ultrafine particles than that predicted by Strefler and colleagues (Figure 2),
reflecting the observed difference between their empirical model and values published and used in this
study.7 Energy consumption at P80 less than 0.01 mm is lower in this analysis and in Shi and colleagues
than that extrapolated by Strefler and colleagues7 due to the latter’s use of a power function that
underestimates SSA and subsequently overestimates comminution energy at grain size less than 0.01 mm.

At particle sizes < 0.01 mm, electricity source plays a critical role in CO2 reductions, as carbon emissions
can exceed 200 kg CO2e/t rock for equipment run on either the US or Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
electricity grid (Figure 2). Employing stir mills and emerging efficient comminution technologies can
shield the EW process from being dependent on the availability of renewables for lowering emissions.35
For example, the IsaMill and high pressure grinding rolls can reduce energy consumption by as much as
20% from ball mills.27,36 In this study, emissions from comminution appear minor in Figure 2, but
represent the second largest source (Table 2).

When accounting for all upstream emissions, we find that the effective net CDR of land-based EW using
the olivine-bearing fines from Oregon can be as high as 658 kg CO2e/t rock. The produced-for-purpose
forsterite and olivine-bearing rock benchmarks achieve a net CDR of 898 and 723 kg CO2e/t rock,
respectively. Meanwhile, dacite and andesite fines from California offer more realistic net CDR of 101
and 136 kg CO2e/t rock, respectively. At project scale, Oregon-sourced olivine-bearing fines achieve
approximately 52,000 to 65,800 net t CO2e sequestration. If a local source of olivine-bearing rock was
established, even with comminution, net sequestration could increase to 72,200 net t CO2e.
Approximately 15 years would be required to completely weather each of the 6 field applications of fines,
suggesting a timeframe of 90 years for a project with a 1 mm material limit. For a project achieving 198
net t CO2e/ha, this allows for the equivalent of 2.2 net t CO2e/ha-year removal rate. Our measured SSA
and dissolution during field trials with the meta-andesite sample suggest potentially more promising
dissolution rates without further size reduction to 0.05 mm. Dissolution rates are uncertain, and
experimental work conducted by some of the authors suggests an annual dissolution rate of 20%,33 which
would allow for nearly complete dissolution over a 30 year project. At the same time, reactive surface
areas may decrease as carbonate minerals precipitate.

For materials with high Epot, upstream process emissions are relatively small (4-5%) compared with the
potential carbon removed (Table 2). Similar to other studies, transportation is a significant source of
GHG emissions, at 43% of emissions for produced-for-purpose olivine-bearing rock in California, and
94% for olivine-bearing fines transported from Northern Oregon. In comparison, Taylor and colleagues9
estimate transportation to account for 88 to 96% of life cycle emissions of wollastonite application in a
forested watershed. Quarry activities account for 48% of GHG emissions for produced-for-purpose small
particle forsterite but only 1.5% of emissions for fines. We find that reducing diesel consumption would
be more effective for lowering GHG emissions than switching to renewable electricity for the particle size
range evaluated (0.05 to 0.179 mm). Loading and spreading on fields is nontrivial at 6 passes over 900
hectares, and accounts for 8% of emissions for the produced-for-purpose olivine-bearing rock in
California (Figure 4).

Emissions from truck transport, loaders, electricity generation and transmission and field application can
result in a large number of life cycle impacts (Table S3). Trucks transporting fines from Southern Oregon
produce not only greenhouse gas emissions, but 20.2 t SO2e which causes acidification, 411 t O3e which
leads to photochemical oxidant formation, and emissions such as particulate matter (4.2 t PM2.5) which
result in human health impacts in communities near transportation routes (163 disability-adjusted life
years (DALY), which indicates the overall burden of disease based on ReCiPe 2016 endpoint (E)). These
impacts should be considered alongside other technologies for carbon removal when weighing costs and
benefits of each technology. If rocks are produced-for-purpose locally, electricity will result in higher
emissions than transportation, particularly for impact categories such as eutrophication and particulate
matter (Figure 3A).

Potential.

3.4 Life-Cycle Cost
The cost of applying locally sourced fines is dominated by fines purchase price, collection and loading,
and transportation, while the cost of using fines sourced from Oregon is mainly comprised of fines
purchase price and transportation (Figure 3A). As expected, the produced-for-purpose local forsterite and
olivine benchmark cases achieve a low levelized cost of net removal, at $34 and $43/net t CO2e,
respectively, with further size reduction down to 0.05 mm adding $2/t-CO2e. Of the real-world quarry
byproduct rock samples evaluated, only the olivine-bearing fines from Southern Oregon achieve a cost
lower than $100, at $96/net t CO2e. Doubling the payload of trucks would reduce this value by $43/net t
CO2e, while it would only lower the levelized cost of using produced-for-purpose forsterite or olivine-

bearing rock locally by $5/net t CO2e. Achieving a cost lower than $100 for fines delivered from Southern
Oregon depends of identifying fines with Epot greater than 740 kg-CO2/t rock, while it is unlikely
materials from Northern Oregon will break $100 (requiring of 1600 kg CO2/t rock or higher).
Alternatively, applying local fines from Ione, CA allows for Epot as low as 260 kg CO2/t rock.

The cost effectiveness of the technology is sensitive to the capacity factor, or annual production rate of
material, and allowable application of material. For example, a company that invests in a given size
equipment and truck fleet for 900 hectares who can now only apply olivine-bearing rock to 40 hectares
would face an increased levelized cost dramatically up to $228/net t CO2e. Meanwhile, increasing
allowable application rates to 111 t-material/ha would reduce cost to only $38/net t CO2e. The effects of
decreasing area versus application rate while holding capital constant are somewhat different, despite both
variables being used to determine the total amount of rock deployed in a project. This is due to explicit
estimation of the number of tractors required per acreage, and the number of passes required to apply a
given amount of rock at a thickness of 1 mm per hectare.

Other studies have placed a major emphasis on the impact of comminution electricity consumption and
the potential for emissions and costs associated with grid electricity. We find that the use of grid versus
renewable electricity had relatively small impact on GHG emissions and cost due to local grid
characteristics even for scenarios with ball milling. Given the high consumption of diesel during the life
cycle, operating in a location with cheap diesel or a cheap diesel substitute would be a more practical
starting point for lowering costs, but would not lower emissions. Notably, andesite fines could achieve a
cost lower than $100 only with roundtrip transport distances below 40 km or diesel prices below $0.83/L
($3.15/gal), while dacite fines achieve a cost lower than $100 at ultra-low diesel prices of $1.28/L
($2.43/gal). Under today’s market conditions, we estimate the use of Northern California fines to cost
$174/t CO2e or more, and Northern Oregon olivine-bearing fines to cost closer to $260/t-CO2e. Increasing
Epot by 70% for forsterite is at the upper bound of potentials estimated for silicate materials, and would
lower levelized cost to ~$21/t CO2e which aligns with the lowest costs reported in literature. We conclude
that such low costs do not represent realistic deployments of readily available quarry fines or producedfor-purpose rock.

473
474
475
476

Labor accounts for 15% of total costs and appears to be underestimated in previous analysis for large EW
projects. A project of this size is expected to generate 5 to 12 full time jobs: 2 field workers, 1 to 8
drivers; and 1 to 2 quarry jobs. More jobs would be produced in regions with different requirements for
shift hours, and jobs related to administration are also expected.

As noted in the previous section, there are several parameters characterizing the regional supply chain that
can significantly influence cost, specifically: the requirement for ultra-small particles (P80), transport
distance, diesel price and emissions, truck payload, tractor speed and fuel economy, driver and worker
wages, bulk density and allowable application rate per project period (Figure 4B). All but the latter two
are well defined. Wages will vary among truck fleets operators, farmers, and quarriers, while application
rates may affect the duration materials are stored or collected from quarries. This plays an important role
in the estimation of truck and tractor capital equipment. As seen in Figure 4B, System parameters that
will be defined by project operators and location, specifically P80, distance, and the price of diesel, can
increase costs by over 50%. Target grain size P80 affects particle SSA, and therefore dissolution rate, as
well as comminution technology selection, cost and energy consumption. Without a limit on application
rates, a smaller P80 improves the efficacy of EW for near-term carbon removal, but only increases costs.

Material loss, bulk density, and upfront capital costs for individual pieces of equipment represent more
uncertain parameters in the analysis, and could potentially have a greater impact on levelized cost than
what is estimated herein. Capital costs for representative equipment are gathered from vendors, but
explicit power and energy consumption rates, as well as equipment lifespans were estimated using energy
efficiency extrapolations and engineering rules of thumb. Further validation is needed regarding: the
potential for siting new specialized equipment such as ball mills on quarries, the existence and operation
patterns of quarry equipment that could be leveraged part of full time, and the starting price for small
diameter materials such as fines that may be either stored at quarries or sold. Bulk density did not have a
significant effect on base cost, but did influence the number of passes required for land application where
there are thickness limits, and thus the necessary number of tractors, fuel consumption, and field labor
hours. There is little reported data on bulk density for silicate materials at the grain sizes considered. Our
review of densities of common powdered materials suggests particle density may be far lower than
particle density at small mean particles sizes. However, at 0.179 mm, and based on reported data for
basalt aggregate, we found 1800 kg/m3 to be a conservative estimate.

The approach presented in this analysis has limitations that make it difficult to determine if dissolutioncorrelated rates of CO2 removal are optimistic or conservative. The range in SSA explored in this study
do not result in 100% dissolution for forsterite or olivine over 30 years when a 1 mm application
thickness is mandated. As noted previously, the olivine rock requires 90 years for application, however
without the 1 mm limit, application would only take 15 years. When dividing project removal by hectares
and 30 years, we find an average removal of 2.7 net t CO2e per hectare per year for the olivine rock (0.89
at 90 years and 5.4 at 15 years). Even a single pass of forsterite would not dissolve in 30 years if SSA is
90% lower than our base value. It only takes ~50% reduction in SSA for the olivine sample at 0.179 mm
to no longer achieve 100% dissolution of a single application of rock over the 30 year project. Similarly,
the range in molar mass evaluated in Table S2 changed total dissolution from 17 to 2 years. Even without
a limit on application thickness, it is sensible to divide applications into multiple years to reduce the
necessary fines purchase and truck fleet in a single year.
Another limitation of this study is that the LCA approach does not capture production of particulate
matter emissions from the rock material itself. We note that at a P80 of 0.179 mm, the particle distribution
will include ultrafine material that may present a health hazard (particulate matter of 2.5 or 10 µm) or that

could potentially blow away during land application or truck transport. These impacts were not included
in this analysis due to limited data. Discussions with several recent startup companies in land-based
enhanced weathering suggest there is significant institutional knowledge between mines and agriculture
for handling dusty materials and for minimizing unnecessary exposures and material loss that could allow
for much greater application rates than 1 mm depth.

Production of aggregate is the second largest non-energy material produced in the United States, with
growth expected as demand for construction materials rises. California is one of the largest producer of
aggregate materials from pit and quarry operations, with numerous stone, sand, and gravel producers in
California and Oregon overlay regions identified as promising for olivine-bearing rock and other rocks of
interest for EW.21,40 At 51,000 thousand tonnes product and assuming 20 wt-% fines byproduct,
California could produce as much as 10 million tonnes of fines from this industry. Quarry fines and mine
tailings present an opportunity for EW due to the decreased need for new quarry activities and
comminution which can have significant GHG emissions and environmental impacts.23,41,42 Assuming the
tailings are purchased for $10/t rock with no other mine associated costs, we find that tailings would
require an Epot of 260 kgCO2/t rock or higher to achieve a levelized cost below $100/net t CO2e (or 160 kg
CO2/t rock, the same as andesite samples, if the cost of tailings is zero). This target CDR potential has
been an important gap in recent literature, as highlighted in a recent review by Feng and Hicks.43
Discussions with several startup companies in the EW space suggest the purchase of mine tailings and
fines, as well as a focus on quarries instead of critical material mines is a promising pathway
economically.

Finally, soil response and enhance biomass production are possible and should be explored as means of
increasing overall life-cycle carbon removal. There is evidence that the application of EW rocks increases
plant growth,8,9 but some minerals (e.g., olivine) introduce the potential for metals such as chromium and
nickel to accumulate in agricultural soils37,38 and may necessitate limiting application to avoid imbalances
in plant nutrition. Samples with high olivine concentrations can contain trace amounts of heavy metals
such as Ni and Cr, and might warrant explicit routine soil tests and mineral tests.39 Assuming material
tests and labor intensive field tests add one cent to every tonne of material produced and increase field
labor rates to $200/hr, it is possible that the cost of local olivine-bearing rock EW could increase by 18%.
The likelihood of contamination of olivine-bearing rocks is a key reason why identifying cost competitive
EW using dacite and andesite fines bears great importance to the field.

4. CONCLUSIONS
This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and cost
profile of land-based enhanced weathering at the scale of 100,000 tonne rock application (~3,000 net t
CO2e/yr sequestration) using rock samples representative of regional quarry materials. We develop and
apply bottom-up models of key life-cycle phases representing real-world market and environmental
conditions to estimate ranges in costs and emission rates. We find life cycle net CDR between 101-136 kg
CO2e/t rock for quarry fines evaluated without high olivine concentrations. Olivine-bearing rock fines

produced at quarries in Southern Oregon today can achieve a levelized cost of net carbon removal below
$100/net t CO2e despite transportation distances to target agricultural lands in Northern California. The
supply chains modeled achieved low costs at reasonable application rates (>25 t/ha), however costs and
life cycle impacts would be substantially lower if a similar olivine-bearing quarry byproduct were to be
identified locally. Rock samples representative of local fines, classified as meta-andesite and meta-dacite,
did not perform as well, highlighting the importance of starting with high quality rock materials which
may be scarce. At the same time, the samples evaluated appear to be more competitive than commercial
direct air capture technologies, which have high costs of $500 to 1000/t-CO2 captured.44 Even short
transportation distances can still generate concerning local emissions from truck transport, and we
highlight the importance of avoiding transportation through populated regions to reduce exposure to
particulate matter and NOx emissions.

Our results agree with recent estimates of cost for land-based EW achieving $55 – 423/net t CO2e. Like
others, we find that annual hours of operation and transportation contribute significantly to emissions and
cost. We note the importance of validating CDR and dissolution rates of recently acquired rock samples,
as well as identify a gap in research related to the availability of fines and quarry byproducts. We identify
several other supply chain uncertainties that require further validation: material loss and starting price,
equipment type and performance at scale, truck fleet operation costs, and the impact of bulk density and
application thickness allowances on annual material application.
As demonstrated in this study, expanding EW research to include materials beyond endmember minerals
that would require dedicated quarries can provide insights on realistic geochemistry, and narrow down
maximum allowable transportation and comminution costs. There is a limit, however, as it will be
difficult for materials with Epot between 160 and 260 kg CO2/t rock to be cost competitive unless colocated with agriculture lands or provided completely free of charge. Through a diversity of scenarios
evaluated, we have shown that starting with a promising material that requires some transportation is as
economical as starting with a free weakly reactive material located right next to nearby land for treatment.
Nevertheless, identifying ways to reduce the consumption of costly and emissive diesel in trucking is
critical for developing EW as a sustainable and socially acceptable carbon removal technology.
