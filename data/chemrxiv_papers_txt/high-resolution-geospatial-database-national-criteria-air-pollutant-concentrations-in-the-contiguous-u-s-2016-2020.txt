Abstract

15

Concentrations estimates for ambient air pollution are used widely in fields such as

16

environmental epidemiology, health impact assessment, urban planning, environmental equity,

17

and sustainability. This study builds on previous efforts by developing an updated high-

18

resolution geospatial database of population-weighted annual-average concentrations for six

19

criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3) across the contiguous U.S. during a five-

20

year period (2016-2020). We developed Land Use Regression (LUR) models within a partial-

21

least-square – universal kriging framework by incorporating several land use, geospatial, and

22

satellite – based predictor variables. The LUR models were validated using conventional and

23

clustered cross-validation, with the former consistently showing superior performance in

24

capturing the variability of air quality. Most models demonstrated reliable performance (e.g.,

25

mean squared error – based R2 > 0.8, standardized root mean squared error < 0.1). We used the

26

best modeling approach to develop estimates by Census Block, which were then population-

27

weighted averaged at Census Block Group, Census Tract, and County geographies. Our database

28

provides valuable insights into the dynamics of air pollution, with utility for environmental risk

29

assessment, public health, policy, and urban planning.

1. Introduction
High spatial-resolution estimates for levels of ambient (outdoor) air pollution are useful

57

for researchers and practitioners in epidemiology, public health and policy, health disparities,

58

environmental equity, urban planning, and climate change (Bonell et al., 2023; Burger et al.,

59

2024; Clark et al., 2014; Coleman et al., 2020; Hankey et al., 2017; Hystad et al., 2011; Nadal et

60

al., 2015; Wang et al., 2023). Databases of ambient air pollution can provide spatially precise

61

information for identifying and analyzing local pollution patterns, thereby allowing for more

62

accurate risk assessment, air quality management, and locally-tailored interventions and policies

63

(Allen & Barn, 2020; Bechle et al., 2023; Colmer et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023;

64

Zwack et al., 2011).

65

Empirical models of air pollution – also called land-use regression (LUR) or Integrated

66

Empirical Geographic (IEG) models – are a geospatial approach that can predict, with fine

67

spatial resolution, concentrations at unmeasured locations (Amini et al., 2017; Di et al., 2019a;

68

Hankey & Marshall, 2015; Keller et al., 2015; Saha et al., 2021; Sampson et al., 2013; Van

69

Donkelaar et al., 2019; Young et al., 2016). While details of the methods employed have evolved

70

over time, LUR models exploit correlations between land use variables (e.g., the road network,

71

population density, industry) and levels of ambient air pollution (Beelen et al., 2013; Hoek et al.,

72

2008; Jerrett et al., 2005; Su et al., 2008).

73

Initially, LUR models were developed for single urban areas (Gilbert et al., 2005; Hankey

74

et al., 2019; Henderson et al., 2007; Hoek et al., 2008; Jerrett et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2019;

75

Marshall et al., 2008; Sanchez et al., 2018; Saraswat et al., 2013). Later, LUR was developed for

76

national (Clark et al., 2014; Kerckhoffs et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2020; Novotny et al., 2011),

77

continental (de Hoogh et al., 2016; Knibbs et al., 2016; Knibbs et al., 2018), and global scales

78

(Larkin et al., 2023; Larkin et al., 2017). Input variables have grown from land-use data, to now

79

include satellite-derived pollution estimates (Bechle et al., 2015; Filonchyk & Peterson, 2023;

80

Knibbs et al., 2018; Roy, 2021), predictions from mechanistic models (e.g., chemical transport

81

models) (de Hoogh et al., 2016; Goldberg et al., 2019), and microscale features (e.g., street view

82

and point of interest) (Lu et al., 2021; Messier et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2022; Qi & Hankey, 2021).

83

Methods have shifted to better allow for non-criteria pollutants (Messier et al., 2018; Saha et al.,

84

2022; Saraswat et al., 2013) and larger amounts of input data (i.e., more measured

85

concentrations, more independent variables; “big data” techniques) and more-rapid, more-

86

sophisticated mathematical modeling (e.g., statistical approach selection, variable prioritization,

87

spatial coverage expansion; “machine learning”) (Beckerman et al., 2013; Di et al., 2019b;

88

Goldberg et al., 2019; Hoek et al., 2015; Keller et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2019; Lu

89

et al., 2021; Masiol et al., 2019; US EPA, 2022; Van Donkelaar et al., 2019; Weichenthal et al.,

90

2016; Wong et al., 2021).

91

A recent inter-comparison of spatial predictions by six national empirical models reported

92

relatively close agreement among annual-average model predictions (Bechle et al., 2023). While

93

the inputs and methods differed among models, the dependent data were consistent: publicly-

94

available United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) regulatory monitoring

95

station data. That result suggests that, among the approaches they compared, the actual methods

96

might not dramatically influence the resulting annual-average predictions, if the dependent

97

variable is EPA regulatory air pollution measurements.

98

Here, we extend and update our previous modeling (Kim et al., 2020): national annual-

99

average empirical models for criteria pollutants in the contiguous U.S. Specifically, in prior work

100

we developed parsimonious national annual-average LUR models to estimate air pollutant

101

concentrations for year-2015 and earlier. Here, we estimate concentrations for years-2016 to -

102

2020, particularly allowing for ongoing health effect studies and exposure disparity research that

103

would reveal evolving environmental impacts and facilitating the comparison of recent periods

104

with historical data (Coleman et al., 2020; Lane et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021). Prior estimates

105

were publicly available for free download and have been integral to a range of applications (on

106

average, currently receiving ~2 downloads per day); the same holds for the current estimates.

107

2. Data and Methods

108

In general, the three steps for empirical models are (1) model building, (2) model testing,

109

and (3) model application. Below, we describe the dependent data (pollution concentrations), the

110

independent data (i.e., “predictor variables”, such as land uses and satellite data), and then the

111

model-building, -testing, and -application stages. The approach employed here is consistent with

112

prior work (i.e., years 2016-2020 here; years 2015 and earlier in prior work).

113

2.1. Dependent data: concentrations of criteria pollutants at regulatory monitoring stations

114

For regulatory purposes, such as ensuring compliance with national standards, EPA

115

measures ambient concentrations of criteria air pollutants at regulatory monitoring stations

116

throughout the U.S. Here, we employ data for year-2016 to -2020 for six criteria pollutants:

117

nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and two types

118

of particulate matter (PM10 [particles with diameters 10 micrometers or smaller] and PM2.5

119

[particles with diameters 2.5 micrometers or smaller]). Data were obtained for all Air Quality

120

System (AQS) monitoring locations via the EPA data repository (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-

121

air-quality-data).

122

The raw data are hourly for gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and daily for

123

particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). We calculated annual-average concentrations of each

124

pollutant (except O3) at each site. Selection criteria, reflecting EPA criteria, are (1) a minimum of

125

18 hours of valid measurements per day, to be considered a valid day; (2) at least 244 valid days

126

per year, or at least 61 days for monitors reporting every three days, or at least 41 days for those

127

reporting every six days (i.e., at least 75% of intended measurements); (3) during the year, a

128

maximum of 45 consecutive days without any measurements (Kim et al., 2020). In contrast, for

129

O3, the “annual average” metric includes only the heightened O3 season from May through

130

September, and represent the daily highest 8-hour average. Selection criteria for O3 are (1) at

131

least 18 hours of measurements to be considered a valid day and (2) at least 75% of valid days

132

measured across the period. This process resulted in data collection from a range of 260 to 1,089

133

monitoring stations per pollutant strategically located across various US regions from 2016 to

134

2020. The breakdown by pollutant was as follows: PM2.5 from 495 to 784 stations, PM10 from

135

290 to 454 stations, CO from 228 to 261 stations, NO2 from 396 to 414 stations, SO2 from 407 to

136

450 stations, and O3 from 1,065 to 1,089 stations. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of these

137

monitoring stations. For LUR modeling, annual-average pollutant concentrations were square

138

root transformed to adhere to the normality assumption.

represents a US EPA regulatory monitoring station.
2.2. Independent data: geographic and land use features and satellite estimates
We used the same predictor variables as in the prior study (Kim et al., 2020). Briefly, the

145

variables cover ten categories: traffic, population, land use/land cover, sources, industrial

146

emissions, vegetation, imperviousness, elevation, position, and satellite air pollution estimates

147

(Table 1). These variables aim to capture various anthropogenic and natural factors that may

148

impact air quality. The variables were quantified as count, length, and area within varying buffer

149

sizes ranging from 50 meters to 15 kilometers; this approach aims to capture potential local and

150

regional pollution impacts. Satellite-based pollution estimates (i.e., column abundance or surface

151

estimates) are annual averages for NO2, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and formaldehyde (HCHO), derived

152

from multiple satellite products (e.g., aerosol optical depth [AOD], ozone monitoring instrument

153

[OMI], and estimates from chemical transport models) (Boersma et al., 2011; Deeter et al.,

154

2017). Consistent with Kim et al. (2020), the HCHO satellite data are a 12-year average (2005 to

2016) rather than annual averages. The resolution of the gridded annual satellite-based estimates

156

varied (NO2, PM2.5, HCHO: 0.1°×0.1°; SO2, CO: 0.25°×0.25°). Overall, we employ a total of

157

~360 variables. Additional details regarding data processing and variable calculation are in (Kim

158

et al., 2020).

165

2.3. Modeling -building and -testing
Consistent with previous modeling approaches (Kim et al., 2020; Sampson et al., 2013;

166

Young et al., 2016), we employed a hybrid modeling approach that integrates partial least

167

squares (PLS) with universal kriging (PLS-UK). Specifically, the two components (1) address

168

variance through kriging that utilizes an exponential covariance function for the variogram and

169

(2) managing the mean component via PLS that reduces the dimensions of predictor variables in

170

the linear regression process. This combination not only encompasses a broad range of

171

geographic factors but also mitigates the likelihood of generating extreme predictions (Mehmood

172

et al., 2012). Covariance parameters in kriging and regression parameters for PLS summary

173

predictors were selected based on a maximum likelihood approach. We adopted two and three

174

PLS predictors based on cross-validation, respectively, following previous studies using a similar

175

modeling framework (Kim et al., 2020; Young et al., 2016).

176

To further investigate the model-building process, we employed forward selection to

177

choose an optimal subset of variables from the full set, for use in the PLS approach. That is, the

178

process begins by identifying the variable with the highest correlation to the dependent variable

179

and incrementally adding variables that yield the highest partial F-statistic in combination with

180

previously selected variables. This process examines how the number of selected variables

181

influences the model performance.

182

For model testing, we executed two types of 10-fold cross-validation (CV) training and

183

testing: (1) in conventional CV, monitoring sites are divided into 10 groups randomly; (2) in

184

spatially clustered CV, k-means is used to establish 10 spatial groups (clusters) spatially (Young

185

et al., 2016). In both CV, there are 10 iterations, each involving setting aside one group for

186

model-testing and using the remaining groups for model-building. Conventional CV evaluates

187

model performance at random locations; spatially clustered CV reflects model performance at

188

sites distant from monitoring stations.

189

To evaluate model performance via cross-validation comparisons, we utilized

190

standardized root-mean-square error (sRMSE) and a mean squared error (MSE) – based R2

191

metric. sRMSE, calculated as RMSE divided by the mean concentrations of all monitors, allows

192

for comparisons across pollutants. MSE-R2 (hereafter R2), defined as one minus the ratio of the

193

sum of squared prediction errors to the sum of squared deviations from the observation mean,

194

assesses the fit of the predictions to the 1:1 line rather than the regression line (Knibbs et al.,

195

2016; Wang et al., 2012).

196

2.4. Model application

197

The most effective LUR models identified through this process were then applied to our

198

nationwide model predictions for each pollutant and year. After we identified the best models for

199

each pollutant and respective year, we predicted the annual average concentrations for

200

approximately 7 million Census Block centroids with nonzero population throughout the

201

contiguous U.S. Subsequently, we calculated population-weighted averages at several

202

geographical levels, including Census Block Groups, Census Tracts, and Counties for years 2016

203

– 2020, aligning with the 2010 Census boundaries. Of the 30 models attempted (i.e., 6 pollutants,

204

5 years), we were unable to generate one of the models [O3, 2020] because of data constraints,

205

leaving 29 resulting pollutant-year models. This approach was designed to offer our estimates

206

across diverse spatial resolutions for all criteria pollutants, catering to a variety of application

207

needs. All LUR model development were carried out in R (version 4.2.1).

3.1. Monitoring data

210

The main trend for monitoring data we investigated (Figure 2) is, with the exception of

211

O3, a slight decline in air pollutant concentrations. This pattern is consistent with the previous

212

years of regulatory monitoring data, indicating improved air quality measures or other

213

environmental policy impacts nationwide (Kim et al., 2020). For PM2.5 and PM10, the

214

concentrations slight increased from 2016 to 2018, but decreased in 2019 and 2020. NO2 was

215

steady from 2016 to 2019 and showed a slight decrease in concentrations in 2020. SO2 generally

216

demonstrated a downward trend in mean concentrations and consistent year-on-year reduction

217

while CO and O3 displayed minor yearly fluctuations with no apparent trend in concentrations.

PM10 is µg/m3. The unit of CO is ppm. The unit of NO2, SO2, and O3 is ppb.
3.2. Model evaluation

226

Overall, for each pollutant and across both CV methodologies, LUR models constructed

227

with around 30 predictor variables consistently yielded better R2 and lower sRMSE as compared

228

to models with more predictors (Figure 3). This pattern underscores the diminishing returns and

229

potential overfitting when too many variables are included (Kerckhoffs et al., 2019; Li et al.,

230

2017). The temporal stability from 2016 to 2020 of model performance also highlights the

231

robustness of the LUR models. These results imply that a more parsimonious approach to model

232

development, i.e., selecting only the most pertinent categories of predictor variables, can provide

233

more reliable models; that finding is consistent with prior research (Kim et al., 2020; Meng et al.,

234

2015).

235

In terms of the two CV approaches, LUR models validated using the conventional CV

236

method consistently outperformed those using the spatially clustered CV approach, as indicated

237

by higher R² and lower sRMSE values (Figure 3). That result is consistent with expectations and

238

with the previous modeling effort (Kim et al., 2020). As mentioned above, clustered CV reflect

239

model performance far from other monitors.

Table 2 shows the performance of LUR models using the “best” number of predictor

246

variables. In general, model performance is consistently higher for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3

247

than for CO and SO2, particularly when using conventional CV. Over the five-year span, this

248

trend is evident through the sustained R2 values above 0.70 for PM2.5 and PM10 and exceeding

249

0.80 for NO2 and O3, underscoring the robustness of the LUR models for these pollutants.

Scatterplots of the LUR models using the “best” number of predictor variables for six criteria air

251

pollutants in 2016 (Figure 4) illustrate the level of agreement between predicted versus measured

252

air pollution levels. Scatterplots reveal similar patterns as in Table 2.

Note: sRMSE, calculated as RMSE divided by the mean concentrations of all monitors. R2
represents MSE-R2, defined as one minus the ratio of the sum of squared prediction errors to the
sum of squared deviations from the observation mean, and it assesses the fit of the predictions to
the 1:1 line rather than the regression line. In conventional CV, monitoring sites are divided into
10 groups randomly; in spatially clustered CV, k-means is used to establish 10 spatial groups
(clusters) spatially (Young et al., 2016).

3.3. Model application
After model-building and -testing, we applied the model across geographies, estimating

269

concentrations at each Census Block and then population-weighted averaging to the Block Group

270

(year-2016: Figure 5), tract, and county. The maps revealed the heterogeneous distribution of

271

each air pollutant. As expected, the PM2.5 concentrations were notably higher in the California

272

and along some urbanized areas of the East Coast, reflecting the combined impact of energy

273

production and dense population centers (Kelly et al., 2021). PM10 levels showed similar patterns

274

likely also reflecting the influence of both natural desert dust and anthropogenic sources (Chen et

275

al., 2010). SO2 levels showed slightly higher levels in Southern and Central states, potentially

276

near industrial sources (Nopmongcol et al., 2019). O3 concentrations demonstrated a broad

277

distribution, with higher levels in the Southern and Southwestern states, which could be

278

attributed to these regions' warmer climates, conducive to O3 formation (Jiao et al., 2016). These

279

maps underscore the diverse spatial patterns of air pollutant concentrations across the U.S.,

280

reflecting regional differences in emission sources, environmental policies, and natural factors.

281

The summary statistics for population-weighted annual average concentrations of air

282

pollutants from 2016 to 2020 revealed an upward trend in PM2.5 exposure, with both median and

283

mean concentrations rising over the five-year period (Table 3). In contrast, NO2 and SO2 levels

284

decreased, suggesting improvements in these pollutants nationwide. PM10 and O3 concentrations

285

fluctuated year-to-year without a clear long-term trend, indicating variability in exposure to these

286

pollutants across the U.S. population.

3.4. Comparison with the previously developed database (1979 – 2015)
The consistent methodology across the current and historical datasets enables users to

301

track long-term trends in air pollution exposure with confidence. Notably, the trend of decreasing

302

NO2 and SO2 levels aligns with historical data, suggesting ongoing improvements in air quality.

303

However, the recent increase in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations as observed in our updated

304

models disagreed with the previous models’ decreasing trend. This finding is consistent with

305

some recent studies (Bekbulat et al., 2021), which warrants further investigation into the sources

306

of particulate pollution. The variability observed in the O3 concentrations is consistent with the

307

historical dataset (Kim et al., 2020). The prediction maps further emphasized the spatial

308

consistency in air pollution distribution as compared to previous periods. For example, areas

309

historically impacted by higher concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, such as California, continue to

310

show elevated levels, while regions with industrial activities remain as hotspots for SO2. These

311

spatial and temporal trends of consistency highlight the persistent influence of both

312

anthropogenic activities and natural impacts on ambient air quality.

313

3.5. Dataset location and format

314

Model predictions can be freely downloaded online at https://www.caces.us/data. The

315

available dataset provides population-weighted annual-average concentrations for the six criteria

316

air pollutants at three geographic levels (Census Block Groups; Census Tracts; Counties) during

317

2016 – 2020 (as noted above, O3 estimates are for summer months, and estimates for 2020 are

318

unavailable).

3.6. Limitations and future work

320

Our comprehensive high-resolution geospatial database supplements previously

321

developed air pollution database (1979 – 2015) and provides detailed estimates of population-

322

weighted annual-average concentrations for the six criteria pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2,

323

SO2, O3) across varying geographic scales, spanning the combined years 1979 – 2020.

324

While our model provides comprehensive geospatial estimates of air pollutant

325

concentrations, it is not without limitations. The reliance on regulatory monitoring data can lead

326

to underrepresentation of air quality in regions with sparse monitoring infrastructure, potentially

327

affecting the precision of estimates in rural or remote areas (deSouza & Kinney, 2021; Kelp et

328

al., 2022). Future enhancements could include the integration of other remote sensing products

329

(e.g., Google Earth Engine) and low-cost sensor networks (e.g., PurpleAir) to increase spatial

330

coverage, especially in under-monitored regions (Brook et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Lu et al.,

331

2022). Modeling performance is not as strong for CO and SO2 as for other pollutants. That result

332

may reflect several possible aspects, including the number and placement of monitors, spatial

333

patterns, and the degree to which those patterns correlate with land-use or other data used in our

334

model. Future research might incorporate more detailed emission inventory data into the model

335

development, aiming to capture point sources and industrial emissions that could significantly

336

affect local concentrations. Our current modeling framework is PLS-UK; future modeling

337

approaches could include other geospatial and empirical models (e.g., machine learning,

338

geographically weighted regression) (Lloyd et al., 2023; Lotfata, 2022; Lu et al., 2021).

339

Furthermore, the temporal resolution here is confined to annual averages, which incorporates but

340

does not shed light on short-term variability, episodic events, or seasonal patterns (Dons et al.,

341

2014); future work could advance the temporal resolution of our models to capture temporal

342

dynamics; this approach may, potentially, inform timely and targeted air quality interventions

343

(Gladson et al., 2022; Masiol et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2022). To be consistent with the prior

344

modeling efforts (Kim et al., 2020), our approach is based on regulatory monitors and so is

345

confined to criteria pollutants; future work could consider air toxics or emerging pollutants, if

346

monitoring data were available (Amini et al., 2017; Jedynska et al., 2014; Saha et al., 2021).

347

4. Conclusion

348

We developed a high-resolution geospatial database consisting of the population-

349

weighted annual average concentrations of six key criteria air pollutants across the contiguous

350

U.S. from 2016 to 2020, at several geographical levels, including Census Block Groups, Census

351

Tracts, and Counties. Our models were developed using a PLS-UK framework; the models

352

achieved reasonable performance, consistent with our earlier published models.
