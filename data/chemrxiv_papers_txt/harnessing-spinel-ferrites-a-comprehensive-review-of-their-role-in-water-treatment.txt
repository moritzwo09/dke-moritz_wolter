Abstract
Addressing water pollution effectively has led to the recognition of spinel ferrites as highly promising materials
due to their inherent stability, magnetic characteristics, and photocatalytic capabilities. This review evaluates
recent progress in employing spinel ferrites for the degradation of organic contaminants in water, highlighting
their beneficial properties such as low bandgap energy, hydroxyl radical generation under light, and ease of
separation through magnetic properties. Despite considerable research efforts, optimizing the synthesis techniques
and photocatalytic performance of spinel ferrites remains a challenge. Key areas needing further exploration
include improved doping methods, modifications to enhance photocatalysis, and evaluations of reusability,
durability, and scalability. This review addresses these issues by providing a thorough analysis of recent
innovations in spinel ferrite-based photocatalysts, including novel hybrid materials and advanced synthesis
techniques like sol-gel, co-precipitation, and hydrothermal processes. This review offers an in-depth examination
of the latest advancements in spinel ferrite photocatalysts, focusing on their applications in water purification. It
investigates the influence of operational parameters; such as pH, temperature, light intensity, and catalyst dosage
on efficiency and explores emerging composite materials and previously unexplored spinel ferrite systems. By
incorporating recent research developments, the review underscores the significant potential of spinel ferrites and
their composites for enhancing sustainable water treatment technologies.

Introduction:

One of the essential components of human
civilization, water, has been well-researched.
Roughly 71% of the Earth's surface is made up of
water, 97% of which is salty. Freshwater makes up
the remaining 3%, of which just 1% is fit for human
use. Additionally, this 1% is dispersed unevenly
around the world, which makes freshwater
availability a critical problem for many countries.[1,
2]
Water stress occurs when there is a lack of
insufficient water for usage in homes, businesses, or
agriculture. This covers various physical aspects of
water resources, such as water availability, flow in
the environment, and water quality.[3-5] Several
important factors, including population growth,
industrialization, urbanisation, aquifer depletion,
climate change, and water pollution cause long-term
water crises.[6-9] Meeting the worldwide demand for
clean drinking water in the long-term prospects
seems to be unachievable because the total amount
of water in the hydrologic cycle stays essentially
constant, existing in many forms such as ocean,
surface and groundwater, and rains.[10, 11]
Nevertheless, climate change is anticipated to
impact both the quality and quantity of potentially
accessible drinking water by intensifying floods,
worsening droughts, and increasing the toxicity of
chemical pollutants in the environment.[12, 13] Water
contaminants may be classified into two primary

categories: point source and nonpoint source. Point
source pollution is derived from specific and easily
identified sources, while nonpoint source pollution
is derived from a variety of various sources. In
addition, water pollutants may be categorized into
several categories depending on their basic
physicochemical characteristics. These types
include radioactive in nature, thermal energy,
microorganism-related, nutrient-based, suspended
elements and sediments, as well as organic and
inorganic pollutants.[14-16] The toxic nature of
industrial effluent-containing dyes poses a
considerable concern since they contain damaging
and carcinogenic contaminants such as heavy
metals, volatile organic substances, strong odours,
and other hazardous elements. This poses a
substantial threat to both human welfare and aquatic
ecosystems.[17, 18] The main sources of these
hazardous pollutants are from sectors such as
textiles and clothing, leather products, printing,
paper production, cosmetics, also medicines,
processing of food, and animal feed making.[19, 20]
Every year, approximately 1.6 million tons of dyes
are manufactured. The dyeing industry commonly
utilizes various organic components, predominantly
employing reactive dyes, dispersed dyes, vat dyes,
and direct dyes.[21, 22] Various industries, including
metal plating, mining, tanneries, painting,
automotive radiator production, and agriculture,
significantly impact the pollution of heavy metals in

aqueous waste streams. These industries produce
toxic waste that contains non-biodegradable heavy
metals like Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Hg, and Cd, which
contaminate
water
resources,
including
groundwater. The accumulation of these heavy
metals in living organisms can result in various
health issues. For example, Chromium poses a
severe threat to both plants and animals, causing
catastrophic illnesses. This review aims to address
the issue of environmental pollution caused by dyes
and heavy metals. To tackle this problem, spinel
ferrites are proposed as a potential solution. This
type of material has shown promising results in
effectively removing these pollutants and mitigating
their harmful effects on humans, animals, and the
environment.
1.1. Spinel Ferrites
Spinel ferrites are a family of elements that possess
remarkable stability, magnetic characteristics, and
photocatalytic efficacy due to their unique cubic
crystal structure. Figure 1 from the Scopus database
provides proof that spinel ferrites have been
employed for the past 13 years. The statistics of
publications indicate that there have been 11,751
publications on spinel ferrites in the past 13 years.
Over time, a growing body of research on spinel
ferrites was carried out. They consist of trivalent
(octahedral) and divalent (tetrahedral) metal cations,
which are represented by the general formula AB2O4
in Figure 2. The photocatalytic behaviour of these
cations is significantly influenced by the presence of
transition metals. These metals cause the bandgap to
become concentrated in electronic states, which
effectively separates charges, which is an essential
part of photocatalysis. The remarkable properties of
spinel ferrites such as their remarkable chemical
stability, low bandgap energy, and ability to
generate hydroxyl radicals in response to light have

drawn a lot of attention. These qualities provide
great promise for water restoration procedures and
make them perfect for the effective degradation of
organic contaminants. Their ability to separate
easily from the reaction liquid is due to their
magnetic characteristics, which improve process
efficiency and lower secondary pollutants. We
present a comprehensive overview of the latest
advancements in spinel ferrite-based photocatalysts
in this work. We study synthesis methods that
significantly affect ferrites' size, shape, and surface
properties, all of which affect how well they
photocatalyze. We also look at doping schemes and
changes that improve their photocatalytic activity,
such as heterojunction creation and bandgap
engineering. Furthermore, we use spinel ferrites to
study the processes behind the photocatalytic
degradation of contaminants. We focus on the role
played by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and charge
carrier separation and transfer mechanisms. We also
investigate the effects of various operating
parameters on the photocatalytic process, including
pH, temperature, light intensity, and catalyst dosage.
Lastly, we draw attention to the difficulties and
constraints that still exist in the real-world use of
spinel ferrites for the remediation of water pollution,
including issues with reusability, long-term stability,
and scaling up the photocatalytic process for
commercial uses. We wrap up by talking about
potential avenues for future studies, such as
investigating new composite materials, exploring
unexplored spinel ferrite systems, and incorporating
these materials into cutting-edge water treatment
technologies. According to this review, spinel
ferrites hold a great deal of promise as adaptable
materials to fight water pollution. The present study
aims to provide an overview of the potential,
difficulties, and state-of-the-art related to the use of
these materials in advanced material science and
environmental sustainability.

Spinel ferrites as a photocatalyst:

Zhang et al. synthesized CoFe2O4-graphene hybrid
materials (CFGHs) with different GO/CoFe2O4
weight ratios by employing Dafeng et al.'s
combustion technique. The as-synthesised CFGHs
outperformed pure CoFe2O4 in their ability to
photocatalytically degrade Methylene Blue (MB)
when exposed to visible light.[23] The hydrothermal
method was used to manufacture multi-walled
carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrids and spinel
nickel ferrite with different concentrations of
MWCNT. The study aimed to explore the
photocatalytic activity of NiFe2O4/MWCNT hybrids
in decolourizing Congo Red (CR) in an aqueous
solution using simulated solar light irradiation. This
innovative fusion has the potential to effectively
address a wide range of dyestuff effluent on a large
scale.[24] Using GO and various metal ions as starting
materials, Bai et al. developed a one-pot
solvothermal synthesis process to create hybrids of
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported ferrite
(MFe2O4, M = Mn, Zn, Co, and Ni). These hybrids
have proven to be highly effective adsorbents for
removing dye pollution. Researchers have
discovered that a concentration of 0.6 g/L of
combinations can eliminate 100% of MB and over
92% of Rhodamine B (RhB) in 2 minutes, with a 5
mg/L concentration. The hybrids also show
improved photocatalytic activity in MB and RhB
degradation. This research could make a new,
straightforward
separation
platform
for
decontaminating wastewater available.[25] Sun et al.

devised a straightforward hydrothermal synthesis
technique to create a magnetically separable
photocatalyst composed of P25/CoFe2O4/graphene.
The quantity of P25 in the catalyst was varied. The
result shows that the P25/CoFe2O4/graphene
photocatalyst surpasses other photocatalysts, such as
CoFe2O4/graphene,
P25/CoFe2O4,
and
P25/graphene, in terms of both the adsorption
process and photocatalytic degradation.[26] Xiong et
al. have developed a simple two-step hydrothermal
cadmium sulfide-ferrite nanocomposite (NC) (CdSMFe2O4, where M can be either Zn or Co) with
different ferrite concentrations. The addition has
improved photocatalytic stability and efficiency
under visible light irradiation, and it may be
employed as a magnetically recoverable
photocatalyst. When exposed to visible light, the
degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) and RhB in a
water-based solution was assessed to determine the
material's photocatalytic performance.[27]
Fu et al. devised a simple technique for creating a
CuFe2O4-graphene hetero-architecture through
hydrothermal fabrication. This structure has a
variety of uses, including magnetic cycling,
increased photocatalytic activity when exposed to
light, and remarkable electrochemical behaviours
that make it suitable for use as the anode in lithiumion batteries. The photocatalytic activity data show
that the formerly inert CuFe2O4 drastically changes
and becomes a highly active catalyst for the
breakdown of MB when coupled with graphene.[28]
Ji, Haiyan, et al. used a straightforward
chemisorption approach to create new magnetic
graphitic
carbon
nitride
g-C3N4/NiFe2O4
photocatalysts. After five runs with hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) and visible light illumination, the
7.5% g-C3N4/NiFe2O4 composite exhibits high and
stable photocatalytic activity as prepared.[29] Zhang
et al. used a one-step chemical coprecipitation
method to successfully create magnetic composites
of ZnFe2O4 and BiVO4. By doping ZnFe2O4 with a
narrow band gap, BiVO4's photocatalytic activity
was enhanced. This resulted in a larger production
of photo-produced electrons and a higher absorption
of visible light when compared to pure BiVO4.[30]
Yao et al used a simple reflux approach to synthesize
magnetic ZnFe2O4-C3N4 hybrids. They employed
graphitic C3N4 sheets and ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) (about 19.1 nm in size) in methanol at 90°C.
The catalytic activity of heterogeneous ZnFe2O4C3N4 catalysts was assessed utilising orange II's

photo-Fenton discolouration procedure. This
approach involved the use of H2O2 as an oxidant as
well as visible light irradiation (> 420 nm). The
results of five distinct studies consistently
demonstrated that the heterogeneous ZnFe2O4-C3N4
hybrid operated successfully and without loss of
activity. This demonstrates a realistic use for the
photo-oxidative
degradation
of
organic
contaminants.[31] Wu, et al. proposed a simple
method for incorporating magnetic ZnFe2O4 NPs
into a rGO network. This was accomplished by
utilising highly reactive ZnOx(OH)y and FeOx
colloids as precursors. The precursors were
synthesised by laser ablation of metallic zinc (Zn)
and iron (Fe) targets in distilled water. The resulting
nanocrystals
significantly
improved
the
photodegradation efficacy of the MB dye.
Furthermore,
the
remarkable
magnetic
characteristics of the ZnFe2O4 NPs enable facile
catalyst recovery by magnetic separation from the
solution. This study expands the potential use of
ZnFe2O4 NPs as photocatalysts, which may be
triggered by visible light to destroy organic
contaminants. Furthermore, it devised a unique
method for synthesising ZnFe2O4-rGO (NCs).[32]
Khadgi et al. used a straightforward one-pot
hydrothermal method to commercialize ZnFe2O4, a
photocatalyst that is responsive to visible light, by
combining it with graphene oxide (GO) and silver
NPs. Consequently, they synthesized NC referred to
as ZnFe2O4-Ag/rGO. This NC was evaluated for its
photocatalytic efficiency using visible light to
degrade 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a non-dye
chemical compound regarded as an emerging
pollutant with endocrine-disrupting effects.[33] Chen
et al. researched the degradation of 2,4dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) using a new photocatalyst
composed of a magnetically separable NC of rGO,
ZnFe2O4, and silver phosphate (Ag3PO4). The
photocatalyst was created using the solvothermal
and in situ precipitation methods. According to the
study, rGO/ZnFe2O4/Ag3PO4 NC demonstrated
superior photocatalytic activity and stability
compared to pure Ag3PO4.[34] Kulkarni et al.
reported that magnetically separable core-shell
ZnFe2O4@ZnO NPs could break down aqueous
Methyl orange (MO) under visible light by
photodegradation. ZnFe2O4@ZnO NPs are efficient
solar photocatalysts because they can be easily
separated using a magnet, have a surface area of 41
m2/g, and can absorb visible light. ZnFe2O4@ZnO
NPs have superior UV photocatalytic efficiency
compared to ZnO. This is a result of the massive
generation of electron-hole pairs. It has been
documented for the first time that ZnFe 2O4@ZnO

NPs can be utilized for visible light
photodegradation of MO. The ZnFe2O4@ZnO NPs
have high photocatalytic efficiency and can be
reused multiple times, indicating their applicability
for solar photocatalytic applications.[35] N-doped
TiO2/ZnFe2O4 catalysts were effectively synthesised
using one-pot vapor-thermal coupling of nitrogenmodified TiO2 and ZnFe2O4. Yao et al. examined the
hybrids' UV-vis photocatalytic capabilities.
Furthermore, the effects of catalyst stability, dye
type, and amount on the photodegradation of organic
dyes were examined. This study presents an easily
recyclable photocatalyst for water filtration, as well
as a simple method for creating N-doped
TiO2/ZnFe2O4 hybrids.[36]
Wu et al. produced Ag/ZnO/ZnFe2O4 ternary
composites with hollow and porous nanostructures
using a straightforward calcination procedure.
Zn3Fe(CN)6.xH2O, an Ag-loaded Prussian blue
analogue, served as the precursor for this synthesis
(Ag-ZnPBA). Compared to its binary cousin,
ZnO/ZnFe2O4, the ternary Ag/ZnO/ZnFe2O4
demonstrated noticeably greater photocatalytic
activity in the degradation of organic dye. This result
emphasises how important Ag is to the
photocatalytic process. The study offers a quick and
efficient method for creating multi-component,
homogenous NCs with interesting topologies and a
range of uses.[37] Ren et al. used a hydrothermal
approach and a microwave-assisted synthesis
process to create unique NiFe2O4/Bi2O3
heterostructures. These structures have visible light
photocatalytic activity and were used for the
degradation of antibiotics. The photocatalytic
activity of the NiFe2O4/Bi2O3 heterostructures was
significantly higher than that of a single
semiconductor in removing tetracycline from
water.[38] Fu et al. plan to manufacture a
magnetically
separable
NiFe2O4-graphene
photocatalyst with varying graphene contents using
a straightforward method. It is intriguing to note that
when NiFe2O4 NPs and graphene sheets are
combined, the inert NiFe2O4 undergoes a dramatic
transformation into a highly active catalyst capable
of breaking down MB when exposed to visible
light.[39]

Spinel ferrites based on synthesis methods

3.1 Sol-gel Method:
Ivanets, Andrei, et al. used Fenton-like catalyst
MgFe2O4 and metal-loaded MFe2O4 NPs [(M)Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+] to degrade MB in water
in a recent work. The primary emphasis of the
investigation was on the catalytic breakdown of MB
and the impact of metal ions absorbed into MgFe2O4.
The outcomes show that MgFe2O4 may be a useful

adsorbent and catalyst for eliminating organic
pollutants and dangerous metal ions from multicomponent water solutions.[40] Magnetic CuFe2O4
spinel NPs were synthesised by Feng et al. These
NPs were used as catalysts to activate H2O2 for
sulfanilamide heterogeneous degradation via
external energy-free Fenton-like processes.[41] Desai
and his team have utilised the auto-combustion
method to produce MnFe2O4 NPs. They used a
combination of MnFe2O4 and mM solutions of H2O2
for the degradation of MB dye by photocatalysis
under sunshine.[42] In this study, Trier et al. used the
sol-gel method to synthesise Cu1-xCoxFe2O4 spinel
ferrite NPs for 6 hours at 600 °C with cobalt content
(x = 0, 0.3, and 0.5).[43] Sol-gel technology was
employed to produce MnFe2O4 spinel ferrite NPs as
catalysts for the oxidative disintegration of MO.
These NPs feature delicate magnetic response
properties and a large specific surface area. The tests
showed that they have a strong catalytic activity for
the breakdown of MO. Due to their unique
properties, MnFe2O4 spinel ferrite NPs may be used
in water treatment.[44] Jasrotia, Rohit, and colleagues
employed sol-gel auto-combustion to synthesise NiCu-Zn nanosized spinel ferrites doped with Ag+,
Mn2+ and Cr3+ ions. The chemical formula of the
synthesised
specimens
is
Zn0.3Ag0Ni0.4Cu0.3.4xCr0.3xMn0.3xFe2-xO4
(ZANCuCrMFO) (where x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15).
The study aimed to investigate synthesised
specimens' microstructural, optical, magnetic, and
electrical properties.[45] Muhammad et al. utilised
the sol-gel method to prepare copper ferrites with
indium (In) substitution, having the nominal
composition CuInxFe2-xO4 (where x = 0.00 to 0.32).
The synthesised ferrites exhibited low coercivity and
dielectric parameters, indicating the potential
benefits of using indium-substituted copper ferrites
in high-frequency and switching applications.[46]
Khirade, Pankaj P. et al. investigated how different
synthesis methods affected the qualities of the
structure, microstructure, magnetic, electrical, and
dielectric of Mg1-xZnxFe2O4 nanocrystals prepared
using the ceramic and environmentally friendly solgel method (where x = 0.00 to 0.32).[47] Researchers
Samoila and Petrisor and their team used sol-gel
auto combustion with citric acid as the fuel agent to
create nanosized spinel ferrites MFe2O4 (where M
can be Ni, Co, or Zn). They discovered that using
NiFe2O4 as an adsorbent, a single-objective
optimisation produced an impressive 98.995%
colour removal efficiency. Furthermore, the
adsorption capacity and removal efficiency
improved due to the multi-objective optimisation.[48]
3.2 Co-Precipitation method

Wu, et al. tested the efficacy of magnetic ferrite
CuFe2O4 powder as an adsorbent and catalyst for
adsorption-catalytic combustion in this work using
Acid Red B (ARB), an organic pollutant. The study
concentrated on three key areas: the material's
reusability as an adsorbent and catalyst; the powder's
catalytic activity for the discharge of ARB and the
characterization of the resultant products;[49] and P.
Annie et al. employed a rapid and cost-effective coprecipitation technique to create several metal
ferrites (MFe2O4 = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Sr). The
spinel metal ferrite NPs have garnered much
attention because of their extraordinary properties,
particularly their optical and magnetic properties.
The resultant metal ferrites are employed as a
nanocatalyst in the photo-degradation process of
MB dye, a prominent organic dye used in the textile
industries.[50, 51] MgFe2O4 NPs were synthesised by
Kaur N et al. using sol-gel, solution combustion, and
co-precipitation techniques.[52] The Mg1xZnxFe2O4
NPs (x ranging from 0 to 0.9) were produced using
the sol-gel process by Reyes-Rodríguez et al. The
study found that certain water suspensions of
Mg0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4 and Mg0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4 could heat up
to 42°C within 10 minutes, indicating the NPs'
magnetic properties.[53] The research conducted by
Ajeesha, T. et al. involved using the chemical coprecipitation method to create NPs of spinel Mg1xNixFe2O4 (where x = 0.0, 0.6, and 1.0). The
synthesised materials were tested for their suitability
in photocatalytic applications by using them to
degrade MB. These materials demonstrated
absorption activity in the visible spectrum,
according to optical studies.[54] Irshad, Amna, et al.
successfully made cobalt-substituted magnesiumzinc ferrites (MZF) in this work by using the coprecipitation
technique.
Through
the
photodegradation of coloured and colourless
pollutants in the presence of light, they assessed the
photocatalytic activity. This study's main goal was to
look into the photocatalytic degradation of
hazardous
materials
including
MB
and
benzimidazole. When cobalt was added, the MZF's
ability to function as a photocatalyst was increased.
The highest cobalt level, MZF3, resulted in the
greatest amount of MB photodegradation. As a
result, it can be said that Mg0.5Zn0.5CoxFe2O4 is a
promising catalyst for treating wastewater.[55]
3.3 Hydrothermal method
Su et al. used a hydrothermal process to produce
nanocrystals of meso-ZnFe2O4 by reacting
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with
ZnFe2O4. The quantity of ZnFe2O4, the
concentration of H2O2, and the degradation of Acid
Orange II (AOII) at various sintering temperatures

were used to assess the photocatalytic activity of
ZnFe2O4 under visible light. Furthermore, ZnFe2O4
preserved its degradation effectiveness throughout
multiple subsequent batch runs, illuminating the
accurate photocatalytic mechanism.[56] Liu et al.
created a NiFe2O4 NPs magnetic species that
catalyzed the degradation of RhB in the presence of
oxalic acid through a photo-Fenton catalytic
property. The best breakdown rates were achieved at
pH 3.0 with 1.0 mM oxalic acid. The magnetic
catalyst was highly active, extremely stable, and
simple to separate using an external magnet,
according to seven cyclic tests for the deterioration
of RhB. Thus, this magnetic catalyst shows promise
for the removal of organic pollutants.[57] Owing to
the synergistic interactions between Fe and Cu ions,
CuFe2O4 containing Cu+ ions can serve as highly
effective heterogeneous Fenton catalysts. As a
result, a technique by Moreno-Castilla, Carlos, et al.
for creating CuFe2O4 nanospheres (CFNS) was
chosen that also allows cuprite to develop, yielding
a CFNS composite that was then calcined at a
temperature of 400 °C. Nearly all of the phenols had
been completely degraded after 95% elimination of
the total organic carbon (TOC).[58] Three spinel
ferrites CuFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4 were the
subject of a study by Kurian, J. et al. examined their
structural, optical, and magnetic characteristics.
Under the same physical circumstances, these
ferrites were made in an autoclave using various
liquid media and surfactants. In the hydrothermal
method, water was used as the medium and
trisodium citrate as the surfactant. In the
solvothermal approach, ethylene glycol was utilized
as the solvent while polyethylene glycol served as
the surfactant.[59] As heat sources for magnetic
hyperthermia therapy, Fotukian, Seyedeh Maryam,
et al. planned to prepare monodisperse CuFe2O4 and
Fe3O4 NPs in this study utilizing a solvothermal
approach. This is the first report on the solvothermal
synthesis of monodisperse CuFe2O4 NPs with an
average particle size < 50 nm, as far as in the
literature.[60]
3.4 Microemulsion method
Cobalt, nickel, and zinc nanosized spinel-type
ferrites (MFe2O4, M: Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) were
made by Arturo Adrián, et al. utilizing an original
oil-in-water
microemulsion process. These
compounds, especially those created
by
microemulsion, have not been thoroughly examined
for H2 production by the water-splitting
mechanism.[61] Pemartin et al. demonstrated the
potential of oil-in-water microemulsion reactions as
an eco-friendly alternative for synthesizing mixed
oxide spinels with magnetic properties.[62] By using

the micro-emulsion process, Ca-Ni co-substituted
samples of nanocrystalline spinel ferrites with the
chemical formula Mg1xCaxNiyFe2yO4 (x=0.0-0.6,
y=0.0-1.2) were created by Rajjab et al. and they
were then annealed at 700°C for 7 hours. The
improved magnetic properties of synthetic materials
make them ideal for switching and high-frequency
applications, while their reduced dielectric qualities
make them ideal for high-frequency applications.[63]
La-doping Typical micro-emulsion approach used
by Ketan A et al. to manufacture Ni-rich nano Ferro
spinel compounds.[64] Neodymium (Nd3+), a rare
earth element, and its impact on the characteristics
of LiNi0.5NdxFe2xO4 spinel ferrites were covered by
Zaheer Abbas, et al. These ferrites were produced
using a simple microemulsion method.[65] After
employing a multi-microemulsion strategy, a reverse
micelle method was used by Uskoković, V. et al. to
create stoichiometric nanocrystalline nickel-zinc
ferrites.[66] The study by Misra et al. demonstrates
the microemulsion technology's ability to synthesize
a narrow size distribution of various nanocrystalline
ferrites, including nickel and zinc ferrites.[67]
3.5 Template method
Using appropriate salts of nickel, cobalt, or
magnesium as templates, Gu et al. presented a twosolvent technique in this study to fabricate onedimensional spinel NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and
CoFe2O4 nanowires from iron nitrate.[68] Gao, et al.
produced magnetic mesoporous spinel NiFe2O4 with
a high surface area (up to 301.6 m2 g-1) and a welldefined pore size distribution ranging from 2.5-16.2
nm using a single-phase multi-component precursor.
There was no pore-generating template used in the
procedure. Acid Orange 7 (AO7) was successfully
adsorbed by the mesoporous material, which may
also be used as a magnetically separable adsorbent
to remove AO7 from wastewater. AO7 adsorbed on
the adsorbent can be quickly removed by heat
breakdown, and the synthesized mesoporous
NiFe2O4 can be easily recycled while maintaining its
adsorption property.[69] By annealing Mg(OH)2deposited -FeOOH nanorods, Enlei, Zhang, et al.
reported a highly active magnetic MgFe2O4 nanorod
catalyst. The breakdown rate of CR solution reached
95% after 2 hours when the Fenton oxidation of CR
was catalyzed by the MgFe2O4 nanorods in their asprepared state. After five cycles, the catalytic
activity was still quite high. This opens up new
possibilities for the efficient treatment of aqueous
hazardous dye and the manufacture of a onedimensional magnetic catalyst based on a template
technique.[70] Using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a
host matrix, spinel CoFe2O4 nanowires were
effectively created by El-Sheikh SM et al. and the

precursors were slowly thermally decomposed
inside the silica-based template.[71] Yu et al.
produced spherical mesoporous nanocrystal clusters
of nickel and cobalt ferrite, featuring a large surface
area and uniform size distribution. They achieved
this using a template-free solvothermal technique in
ethylene glycol, followed by heat treatment.[72]
Yourdkhani et al. fabricated highly ordered spinel
ferrite MxFe3-xO4 (M = Ni, Co, Zn) nanotube arrays
using anodic aluminium oxide templates with a pore
size of 200 nm. This was achieved by combining a
liquid-phase deposition technique with a templateassisted approach.[73] Zhao, B. et al. synthesized
spherical La3+ doped zinc ferrite clusters without the
use of a template or surfactant using a simple and
effective one-pot solvothermal synthetic method.
The clusters as-prepared also performed well when
it came to adsorbing contaminants like MO from
water.[74]
3.6 Sono chemical method
Low-power sonochemical coprecipitation was used
by Kaur et al.to create CuFe2O4 NPs.[75] Singlephase CoEuxFe2−xO4 (CEFO) (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.10)
nanosized spinel ferrites were synthesized by
Abdullah et al. via a sonochemical approach.[76]
MnFe2O4 single-phase spinel ferrite structure
synthesized by Yadav et al. using a sonochemical
approach.[77] For the first time, Zn0.35Fe2.65O4 (ZFO)
nanostructures were created by Yousefi, S. R. et al.
using the sonochemical approach. By changing the
synthesis procedure, a pure ZFO nanostructure was
created. In the presence of light, these nanomaterials
demonstrate significant photocatalytic activity.[78]
Sonochemically produced CoFe2xGdxO4 (CFG) NPs
with x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 by Yadav et
al. To create extremely crystalline single spinel
crystal phase NPs, sonochemical synthesis is
advantageous. Gd3+ substitution in CoFe2O4 NPs
changes the magnetic characteristics, enhanced ac
conductivity and dielectric constant.[79] In this study,
Amulyaet al. utilized the sonochemical approach to
create NiFe2O4 NPs cost-effectively and simply. The
research demonstrated that NiFe2O4 NPs functioned
as an effective photocatalyst and a reliable electrode
material, exhibiting high electrode reversibility
when detecting paracetamol. Therefore, it is
expected that the sonochemically synthesized
NiFe2O4 NPs will offer valuable insights into their
versatile applications.[80] MNPs made of NiFe2O4
and CoFe2O4 were created by Ilosvaiet al.using a
sonochemical process and combustion.[81] Goswami,
Partha P., et al. studied the sonochemical method for
producing CoFe2O4 NPs.[82] In this study,
Almessiere, Munirah Abdullah, et al. discussed the
benefits of using ultrasonic irradiation to produce

nano spinel ferrites (NSFs) consisting of Dy-Y cosubstituted Mn-Zn spinel-type. Two different
methods were used to synthesize the Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe22x(DyxYx)O4 (MZFDYO) (0.0 x 0.05) NSFs, namely
citrate sol-gel combustion and ultrasonic
irradiation.[83] Goswami, Partha Pratim, et al. used
acetate precursors to describe the sonochemical
production and characterization of Mn-ferrite
NPs.[84]
3.7 Electrochemical method
MnFe2O4 NPs were produced by Mazarío et al. using
a combination of electrochemical/chemical
techniques.[85] CoFe2O4 NPs of uniform size have
been produced electrochemically in one step. [86]
Zahra et al. employed electrochemical synthesis to
create ferromagnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) NPs in a
quick and low-cost process. The synthesized
substance was employed as a heterogeneous electroFenton catalyst for decolorizing solutions containing
Acid Scarlet and Acid Blue 92. Moreover, the Fe3O4
NPs can be easily recycled through magnetic
separation, thus preventing them from becoming a
secondary pollutant in the environment.[87] The
magnetic characteristics and cytotoxic effects of
MNPs made from magnetite and Mn, Co, and Ni
ferrites and synthesized electrochemically are
examined by Ovejero et al. in this study.[88] A novel
electrochemical technique was used by Mazario, E.,
et al.to create CoFe2O4 NPs.[89] A team of researchers
led by Lakshmi Ranganatha V. has introduced a
simple, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach for
producing ZnFe2O4 NPs. They assessed the
photocatalytic performance of MB in the presence of
visible light, achieving a removal efficiency of 96%.
Furthermore, the nano-catalyst showed effective
reusability.[90]
3.8 Flame spray pyrolysis method
Kotsikau et al. reported that a single-phase
Zn0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite was fabricated via spray
pyrolysis from a water solution containing iron and
manganese nitrates.[91] Hong, Dachao, and his team
utilized Pluronic F127 as a structure-directing agent
to fabricate submicron-sized mesoporous spheres of
NiFe2O4 using an aerosol spray pyrolysis technique.
The researchers then tested these spheres for
photocatalytic activity in an aqueous methanol
solution by irradiating them with visible light (>420
nm) to produce hydrogen (H2). The high surface area
and crystallinity of the Ni6Fe2O4 led to a significant
photocatalytic activity, resulting in the evolution of
H2 from water with methanol.[92] Chavan et al.
successfully produced Li0.5-x/2MgxFe2.5-x/2O4 (0.0 ≤ x
≤ 1.0) thin films using the spray pyrolysis process to

create nanocrystalline films.[93] Unique chainlike
MFe2O4 nano aggregates have been made by quickly
pyrolyzing nitrates/ethanol as a precursor in a flame

spray process by Li, Yunfeng, et al. Flame spray
pyrolysis is a reliable method for creating binary or
complex oxides with the potential for industrial

application.[94] Using the spray pyrolysis process,
Ni1-xCuxFe2O4 thin films with a wide range of
compositions (0.0 x 1.0 in steps of 0.2) were created
in the current work by Chavan, Apparao R., et al. [95]
Mesoporous carbon spheres filled with NiFe2O4 NPs
were created by Zheng, Jingwu, et al.in a single step
using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis.[96] Aerosol spray
pyrolysis (ASP) was utilized to create oxygendeficient doped ferrite structures that would be
utilized by Lorentzou, S et al. as redox materials in
a two-step thermochemical water-splitting cycle to
produce solar hydrogen from water.[97] Ozdemir et
al. used flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) to create
MnFe2O4 NPs.[98]

characteristics after being carbonized in an
environment of mixed air and argon.[105] Sertkol et
al. created different Co0.5Ni0.5BixFe2-xO4 spinel
ferrite nanofibers (CoNiBi SFNFs) using the ES
method in their study.[106] Jun et al. utilized sol-gelassisted ES to produce composite fibres comprising
Ni-Zn ferrite and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Upon
calcination of the composite fibres at high
temperatures,
cubic
spinel-structured
Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanofibers were obtained.[107] The
ES has been successfully used by Li et al.to create
NiFe2xCexO4 (x = 0-0.03) nanoribbons, which were
then calcined in oxygen at 500°C.[108]

3.9 Electrospinning
By using the electrospinning (ES) technique,
MgFe2O4 nanostructures were successfully created
by Maensiri S et al.[99] Kaur, et al. described the
electrospinning process shown in Figure 3. It is used
to create a new nanofiber membrane comprising
CoNiFe2O4-Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF). The
sol-gel combustion process was used to create the
CoNiFe2O4 NPs.[100] El-Rafei et al. successfully
created CaFe2O4 nanofibers using the ES technique
which are three-dimensional random calcium
ferrites. These NFs are suggested for photocatalysis
applications in water purification since they generate
active hydroxyl radicals under simulated solar light
irradiation.[101] The preliminary findings of the
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofiber study were used
by Na, Kyeong-Han, et al. in this work to optimize
the ES conditions for the synthesis of ferrite (αFe2O3) nanofiber.[102] The optical, electrical, and
dielectric characteristics of electrospun Ni0.5Co(0.5x)CdxNd0.02Fe178O4 (x = 0.25) nanofibers were
investigated in a work by Alahmari, F., et al.[103] In
this study, an ES process was used by Dorneanu, et
al. to successfully generate pure PVDF and
PVDF/CoFe2O4 magnetic fibre composites for oil
spill sorption applications.[104] Nilmoung, S., et al.
described the production of carbon/cobalt ferrite
(C/CoFe2O4) composite nanofibers and their

3.10 Laser ablation method
Almessiere et al. used both sol-gel and green pulsed
laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) methods to produce
samples of ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) spinel ferrite NPs
(SFNPs),
Co0.5Ni0.5Ga0.01Gd0.01Fe1.98O4
(CNGaGdFO)
SNPs,
and
NCs
of
(CNGaGdFO)x/(ZnFe2O4)y.[109] The application of a
pulsed laser beam was used by Almessiere, et al. to
synthesize the NCs of CoTm0.01Tb0.01Fe1.98O4 (soft)
and SrGd0.03Fe11.97O19 (hard) in various ratios using
the green PLAL method.[110] By using the alternating
target laser ablation deposition technique, epitaxial
CuFe2O4 thin films were formed by Yang, Aria, et al.
on
MgO
substrates.[111]
The
magnetic
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 (CNFO) with varying (x%) Se (x =
0.00-0.20) were made by Sadiq Mohamed, et al.
using a sophisticated green laser ablation technique
in conjunction with the sol-gel combustion
pathway.[112] Özçelik et al. investigate structural,
magnetic, photocatalytic properties & blood
compatibility of MnFe2O4 NPs produced by subnanosecond laser ablation in water.[113] MgO
substrates and a variety of CoFe2O4 thin film
samples were created by Yang, Aria, et al. for
alternating target laser ablation deposition and
traditional pulsed laser deposition methods.[114] By
applying the laser-ablation approach, Mn-Zn ferrite
films with a coercive force of roughly 4 kA/m were
produced by Nakano, et al. in a low-temperature
process.[115]

Classification of spinel ferrites based on the
number of metals present:

4.1 Mono metal spinel ferrites:
Due to their unique properties, spinel ferrite NPs
(SFNPs) are highly suitable for various applications,
including use as photocatalysts, biosensors, and
wastewater treatment. The crystallite sizes of the
produced samples, excluding ZnFe2O4, range from
33 to 36 nm. Among these, CoFe2O4 exhibits the
highest saturation magnetization at approximately
60 emu/g. Further research involving various doses,
cell lines, and organisms is essential to fully
understand the effects and potential applications of
SNPs in industrial, environmental, and medical
fields. This will also aid in evaluating their overall
environmental impact.[116] Recent studies highlight a
growing interest in porous magnetic materials for
water pollutant detoxification. These materials are
effective due to their enhanced efficiency and ease
of separation post-treatment. Reddy et al. developed
a three-dimensional porous NiFe2O4 adsorbent
(PNA) with notable magnetic properties, used to
detoxify an aqueous Pb (II) solution. The PNA was
synthesized using chitosan as a precursor through a
sol-gel process. The PNA's surface appearance as
seen in SEM scans revealed its three-dimensional
porous structure, with many interconnected pores.
The NiFe2O4 adsorbent with a 3D porous structure
shows remarkable adsorption characteristics for the
elimination of Pb (II) from water-based solutions. It
takes less than 60 minutes to achieve equilibrium
due to the rapid adsorption rate. Lastly, it was shown
that the adsorbent PNA has exceptional capability
for handling wastewater containing Pb (II).[117]
Sharma et al. synthesized spinel ferrites with the
formula MFe2O4 (where M represents Ni, Cu, Zn,
and Co) to explore their effectiveness in degrading
the reactive azo dye RB5, a model pollutant, through
Fenton and photo-Fenton systems. CuFe2O4
demonstrated high efficiency due to the involvement
of Cu2+ ions in Fenton’s reaction, leading to the

production of more hydroxyl radicals. All the
catalysts remained stable, magnetically separable,
and recyclable even after four cycles, making them
promising materials for wastewater treatment in the
textile industry.[118] In the current study, SnFe2O4
NPs have been created and studied by Singh,
Sunanda, et al. by utilizing three distinct capping
agents, including starch, PVP, and PEG
(polyethylene glycol). The arsenic removal process
involved two key components: SnFe2O4 NPs,
synthesized through chemical precipitation, and a
carbon foam, made by carbonizing polyurethane
foam and then treating it with a phenolformaldehyde solution. The NPs were incorporated
into the carbon foam before it was used to treat As
contaminated water.[119] This study presents the
synthesis of magnetic mesoporous spinel NiFe 2O4,
which possesses a high surface area of up to 301.6
m²/g and a well-defined distribution of pore sizes
ranging from 2.5 to 16.2 nm. The synthesis was
achieved by the simple oxalate decomposition
process using a one-phase, multi-component
precursor. This method effectively generates the
material without the use of any templates to create
pores. This mesoporous material has shown great
potential in adsorbing acid orange 7 (AO7) and
might be utilized as a magnetically distinguishable
adsorbent for wastewater treatment that contains
AO7. In their study, Gao et al. successfully
manufactured mesoporous NiFe2O4, which exhibits
excellent adsorption properties and can be
conveniently recycled without any loss in its
effectiveness. In addition, the adsorbed AO7 on the
adsorbent can be quickly eliminated through heat
breakdown.[69] Sujata, et al. created ZnFe2O4 MNPs
and used them against gram-positive and gramnegative bacterial strains, it had a respectable
antibacterial efficacy. The findings show that these
magnetic ferrites, in their pristine and calcined
forms, made by a soft chemical route and
synthesized in ambient conditions, can be used
successfully as a magnetically recyclable material to

remove biological and chemical contaminants from
water and waste.[120]
In a study by Vinosha et al., CoFe2O4 NPs were
synthesized using a co-precipitation method, with
the pH during the process adjusted between 9 and
12. The resulting nanocatalyst was then employed to
degrade MB dye, a common organic pollutant in
textile wastewater. Notably, the research suggests
that the catalyst exhibits good reusability, making it
a promising option for industrial wastewater
treatment applications.[50] The hydrothermal (ZFOH) and citrate sol-gel (ZFO-C) methods were used
by Zhang et al. to produce the ZnFe2O4 catalysts.
Their findings revealed that the ZFO-H catalyst
significantly enhanced phenol oxidation compared
to uncatalyzed ozonation, with a roughly 1.5-fold
increase in reaction rate. This superior performance
of ZFO-H was attributed to its larger contact surface
area and higher density of surface hydroxyl groups,
facilitating more effective phenol degradation
compared to ZFO-C. Additionally, ZFO-H's ability
to decompose ozone and generate hydroxyl radicals
(•OH) further supports its increased catalytic
activity.[121] ZnSFe2O4 NPs were made by Patil, S.
B., et al. using a combustion process with sugar cane
juice as the fuel to create their spinel-like cubic
shape. The degradation of combined organic dyes
(MB and RB) carried out the photocatalytic activity.
In the presence of a mixture of organic dyes, it
exhibits
excellent
photocatalytic
activity
comparable to the destruction of individual dyes. In
the field of industrial wastewater effluent treatment
for environmental protection, it can be anticipated
that ZnSFe2O4 is a viable photocatalyst.
Additionally, ZnSFe2O4 NPs were chosen for their
antibacterial efficacy against strains of gramnegative bacteria. Different microorganisms,
including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus
aureus were used to test the ZnSFe2O4 NP's
antibacterial activity.[122]
Jadhav et al. used urea and glycine as a combination
fuel and the sol-gel auto-combustion method to
produce NiFe2O4 NPs. Based on the degradation of
the model component, the dye MB, the
photocatalytic activity of the NPs was investigated.
The obtained NPs showed high photocatalytic
activity against MB dye degradation, according to
the results.[123] Gerbaldo and colleagues investigated
a heterogeneous Photo-Fenton approach using
CoFe2O4, H2O2, and UV light (254 nm) to remove
sodium diclofenac, a common non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug. CoFe2O4 were synthesized via
the Pechini process and then calcined at
temperatures between 6000 to 8000 C. The resulting

inverse spinel structure exhibited good performance
in the photo-Fenton reaction. The degradation
process is suggested to involve the formation of •OH
radicals. Using CoFe2O4 calcined at 800°C, 86%
TOC mineralization and complete degradation of
sodium diclofenac were achieved. The catalyst
showed minimal activity loss and low Fe leaching
after three cycles.[124] Udhaya et al. implemented an
eco-friendly approach to synthesize CuFe2O4 NPs
using egg white as a precursor. Notably, egg white
albumin, a component of egg white, is a potential
biofuel. The resulting CuFe2O4 NPs exhibit
promising photocatalytic properties, as evidenced by
their energy band structure. Significantly, these NPs
outperform chemically synthesized CuFe2O4 NPs in
degrading RhB dye under visible light, achieving an
impressive degradation efficiency of 94%.[125] To
degrade the antibiotics TC and MNZ in the
"MgFe2O4/H2C2O4/vis" system Qiu, et al. have
identified an effective Fenton-like catalyst. This
catalyst consists of metal-doped MgFe2O4 derived
from saprolite laterite nickel ore. The formation of
[Fe(C2O4)3]3- complex ions due to the reaction of
octahedral Fe3+ with oxalate ions on the surface of
MgFe2O4 leads to the creation of •OH radicals and
ultimately enhances the catalyst's degrading activity,
as per the TC degradation mechanism. The fresh
catalyst's degrading performance can be maintained
at over 90% even after five cycles, demonstrating its
great cycling stability and applicability.[126]
The MFe2O4 nano ferrites (M = Co, Ni, and Zn) were
created by Dehghani et al. The ability of spinel-type
NPs to adsorb Bromo Phenol Red (BPR) dye from
aqueous solutions. The outcomes demonstrated that
NiFe2O4 had the greatest BPR adsorption capacity.
Both the Freundlich isotherm equation and the
Langmuir equation were employed to analyze
adsorption behaviour. The NiFe2O4 nano spinel is a
highly promising candidate for the adsorption of
triphenylmethane dyes derived from wastewater.[127]
Mohammed A. et al. determined whether CoFe2O4
NPs were suitable for removing chromium and other
pollutants from tannery wastewater. By annealing
the CoFe2O4 NPs at 300, 500, and 900 °C, the coprecipitation approach was successful in producing
the desired results. The wastewater from the tannery
was treated using CoFe2O4 NPs. TDS, BOD, COD,
and chromium removal were each removed with
90.83, 52.72, 48.07, and 23.75% efficiency,
respectively.[128] De la Torre and colleagues used
nitrate salts of cobalt, copper, and iron as precursors
to synthesize cobalt and copper ferrites via the
precipitation method. The molar ratio of Co:Fe or
Cu:Fe was maintained at 1:2, with NaOH serving as
the precipitant. After 8 hours of agitation, the

CoFe2O4 soaked on activated carbon achieved 98%
cyanide oxidation and could be recycled five times
with an 18% reduction in catalytic activity. Iron
dissolved more readily in CoFe2O4 compared to
cobalt, while the dissolution rate of copper was

higher in CuFe2O4. These results suggest that ferrite
and activated carbon composites are promising
alternatives for cyanide treatment in mining
effluents.[129] Frolova et al. used the co-precipitation
approach and low-temperature contact

nonequilibrium plasma treatment to synthesize
nanocrystalline powder of CoxFe3xO4 spinel ferrite.
The objective of the research was to investigate the
impact of cobalt ferrite composition on the rate of
the photocatalytic breakdown reaction of 4nitrophenol (4-NP) under UV light. The findings
indicate that the photocatalytic activity in the
breakdown process of 4-NP diminishes with
increasing.[130] Tatarchuk et al. to make CoFe2O4
Fenton catalysts. Crystallites in the samples that
were annealed at 400 and 600°C measured 16 and 18
nm, respectively. The catalyst for the oxidation of
caffeine and the breakdown of H2O2 that
demonstrated the greatest improvement in catalytic
activity was CoFe2O4 which had been annealed at
400°C. The rate of caffeine breakdown increased by
85% as a result of electromagnetic heating, which
more than doubled the catalytic reaction rate.
CoFe2O4 heated by an electromagnetic field can act
as a controlled catalyst in the water purification
process.[131]

Wang and colleagues synthesized MnFe2O4
nanospheres using a solvothermal process, with
oleic acid employed for hydrophobic modification.
The resulting MnFe2O4 nanospheres exhibited
superparamagnetic properties, high saturation
magnetization, a rough surface, and a well-defined
mesostructure. These unique features make the
MnFe2O4 nanospheres suitable for integration into
magnetorheological (MR) fluids and efficient oil
removal.[132] Using magnetic CuFe2O4, CoFe2O4,
and NiFe2O4 material systems, the harmful nitro
compounds (4-NP, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 2,4,6trinitrophenol) were eliminated by Ramu, A. G., et
al. The hydrothermal approach was used to create
the metal ferrites, and the calcination procedure is
shown in Figure 4. The obtained results support the
idea that a material system based on CuFe2O4 NPs
can be one of the potential catalysts for the process
of removing nitro compounds. [133]

4.2 Bi-metal spinel ferrites:
Dojcinovic, et al. used a combustion process to
create CoxMg1-xFe2O4 spinel ferrites using citric acid
as fuel. Different values of x (0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7,
0.9, and 1) were used, and the amorphous particles
were calcined for three hours at 700°C The presence
of an excessive amount of cobalt resulted in a
decrease in the photocatalytic activity, both under
visible light and natural light conditions.
Interestingly, Co0.9Mg0.1Fe2O4 had a very high
activity level of 74.5% throughout 4 hours. MgFe2O4
had the most significant photocatalytic efficiency
when exposed to natural sunlight, achieving an 82%
degradation rate after 4 hours. In contrast,
Co0.1Mg0.9Fe2O4
demonstrated
the
greatest
photocatalytic activity when subjected to visible
light, achieving a degradation rate of 79% after 4
hours.[134] In a study by Mondal et al., a chemical coprecipitation process was used to synthesize
Zn0.3Ni0.7Fe2O4 (ZNFO) NPs samples with varying
particle sizes. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed

the crystalline phase purity and spinel cubic
structure formation in all samples. Testing the
photocatalytic activity of each nanocatalyst with MB
dye revealed that the smallest ZNFO NPs
demonstrated the highest efficiency in degrading the
dye under light irradiation. Additionally, ZNFO
displayed the strongest ability to eliminate free
radicals compared to other samples. These results
suggest that tailoring the physical properties of NiZn spinel ferrites, particularly by reducing their size,
can enhance their functionality. This makes them
promising candidates for applications in
photocatalysis and as antioxidants.[135] Shukrullah,
Shazia, and other researchers created Ni-ZnFe2O4
NPs by the co-precipitation technique to eliminate
chromium metal from industrial wastewater. The
synthesized NZF NPs hold great promise for
wastewater treatment. Their effectiveness stems
from a combination of factors: an extensive surface
area, precisely controlled size, and a well-organized
internal structure. In the experiment, the industrial
wastewater was mixed with the described NPs

continuously for 20 mins, and the photocatalytic
behavior of NZF NPs was investigated using UV-vis
spectrophotometry on the suspension of the NPs.
The study found that Zn doping in NZF plays a
crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of Cr
removal from wastewater, particularly under visible
light irradiation.[136] Jesudoss, S. K., et al.
successfully created Spinel magnetic ferrite Mn1xNixFe2O4 NPs using a microwave combustion
method. They found that Mn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs had
the best photocatalytic activity in breaking down
synthetic indigo carmine dye. The researchers also
observed that the NPs had antibacterial effects
comparable to that of the antibiotic streptomycin.
These results suggest that these NPs could be a
promising low-cost photocatalyst for wastewater
treatment and environmental remediation.[137]
Deepika, et al. used the citrate precursor approach to
create cobalt-zinc ferrite with the chemical formula
CoxZn1-xFe2O4. It was shown that a rise in cobalt

concentration accelerated the breakdown of MB.
Under visible light irradiation, the degradation
efficiency increased to a maximum of 77% and a
minimum of 65% in 1 hour. As a result, they
conclude that cobalt-zinc ferrite is a viable material
for water filtration and that its degradation efficiency
increases with increased cobalt concentration.[138]
Researchers investigated spinel NPs (Mg1xNixFe2O4) synthesized using a chemical coprecipitation method. The study explored their
structural, magnetic, optical, and photocatalytic
properties. Notably, the materials exhibited light
absorption in the visible region, indicating their
potential
for
photocatalytic
applications.
Furthermore, increasing the nickel content narrowed
the band gap energy, enhancing their photocatalytic
activity for degrading MB dye. These findings
suggest these NPs hold promise for wastewater
treatment. [54]

A study investigated the use of coprecipitation and
sol-gel techniques to synthesize a novel hybrid
material, Cu0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4-TiO2. This material was
designed to target the breakdown of organic dyes
present in wastewater. The experiment achieved a
successful synthesis of the composite material, with
the TiO2 and Cu0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4-TiO2 components
averaging around 40.1 nm and 27.9 nm in size,
respectively. Importantly, the Cu0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4TiO2hybrid exhibited superior photocatalytic
activity in degrading RhB dye compared to its
counterparts, Cu0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4 and TiO2. This
finding suggests promising potential for this
material in wastewater treatment applications.[139]
A study investigated the photocatalytic activity of
cobalt-substituted
magnesium-zinc
ferrites
synthesized using a coprecipitation method. The
research aimed to assess their ability to degrade
coloured and colourless pollutants, including
harmful substances like benzimidazole and MB dye,
under sunlight irradiation. The results revealed a
significant improvement in photocatalytic activity
with increasing cobalt content. Notably, MZF3, with
the highest cobalt level, demonstrated the most
effective MB degradation. These findings suggest
that Mg0.5Zn0.5CoxFe2O4 holds promise as a potential
catalyst for wastewater treatment applications.[55]
Researchers investigated using Fenton chemistry to
treat wastewater containing pollutants that resist
biodegradation. Their approach involved developing
environmentally friendly recoverable ferrites as
catalysts. These catalysts were then used in a solar
photo-Fenton process under slightly acidic
conditions to break down ciprofloxacin (CPX) and
carbamazepine (CBZ). The study successfully
degraded both pollutants, identifying the
degradation pathways. For CPX, the breakdown
targeted specific molecular structures within the
molecule. CBZ degradation involved the formation
of intermediate compounds, which were further
transformed through a series of reactions.[140] A
study successfully synthesized high-quality ZNF
NPs with a narrow size distribution and small
diameter. These NPs exhibited significantly
improved magnetic properties, making them suitable
for applications in photocatalysis and localized
magnetic
hyperthermia
treatments.
This
enhancement was attributed to the specific
positioning of nickel ions within the NP structure.
The researchers further evaluated the photocatalytic
activity of each NP by measuring its effectiveness in
degrading MB dye under visible light irradiation.
The results revealed a clear correlation between the
concentration of nickel ions and the degradation

efficiency, with higher nickel content leading to
faster dye degradation. The study demonstrates that
incorporating nickel into these spinel ferrites
significantly increases their catalytic activity under
visible light.[141] Gul, et al. used a quick and
inexpensive chemical process called coprecipitation to create AlxZnFe2-xO4 NPs. The
material was found to have significant resistance
values after an electrical investigation. The synthetic
NPs' optical characteristics demonstrated that they
were suitable for photocatalysis and could break
down the organic chemicals in the water.[142] Zhang,
B. B. et al. used a hydrothermal technique to attach
Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (MZFO) into AC, producing AC
NCs with outstanding magnetic response for
wastewater treatment. [143]
George, et al. prepared Cu-MgFe2O4 (CMFO) NPs
using a simple chemical co-precipitation technique,
as these NPs can act as effective photocatalysts to
remove dye contaminants from wastewater. The
antibacterial activity of CMFO NPs was investigated
using the agar well diffusion method. Among the
samples tested against the Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria Escherichia coli and Micrococcus
luteus, CMFO-2 and CMFO-3 NPs demonstrated
the most excellent antibacterial activity, while
CMFO-1 NPs showed minimal activity. To test the
effectiveness of spinel CMFO NPs at removing dye,
organic MB was used in a photo-Fenton
operation.[144] Singh et al. conducted a
comprehensive study on the effects of adding Ru to
sol-gel-prepared MRuxFe2xO4 (MRFO) (M = Ni, Cu:
x = 0.0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.1, and 0.4) spinel nanoferrites.
The study assessed the photocatalytic activity of
MRFO NPs for the degradation of the antibiotic
CPX and the Remazol deep red dye. The results
showed that Ru-doped nanoferrites were highly
effective
in
degrading
both
substances.
CuRu0.1Fe1.9O4 degraded the drug in 90 mins, while
NiRu0.4Fe1.6O4 degraded the dye in just 5 mins. The
high degrading efficiency of Ru-doped nanoferrites
demonstrates their potential in photocatalysis
applications.[145] Chromium absorption from textile
effluent was studied by Jemal Fito et al. using MnNi ferrite NC. The NC showed promising results in
eliminating chromium from industrial wastewater,
and its adsorption mechanism was found to be
chemical sorption and monolayer.[146]
Hoa et al. used Hydrothermal synthesis to create
CoFe2O4 NPs. They then added Ag NPs to the
CoFe2O4 NPs with jasmine extract serving as the
reducing agent for Ag+ ions to create Ag/CoFe2O4
NPs. The catalytic results demonstrated that Ag/
CoFe2O4 NPs could activate peroxymonosulfate

(PMS), producing sulfate radicals that can oxidize
several dyes, including MB, MO, and RhB. The Ag
NPs in the Ag/CoFe2O4 sample were validated to
have functions in dye adsorption, 4-nitrophenol
reduction, and enhanced antibacterial behaviour.
Ag/CoFe2O4 NPs were found to have growth
suppression activity against P. aeruginosa and S.
aureus. After three consecutive runs, Ag/CoFe2O4
NPs also showed good reusability. These results
suggest that Ag/CoFe2O4 material is a viable
multifunctional catalyst for the treatment of
wastewater.[147] Co1xSrxFe2O4 NPs synthesized by
M.K. Shobana et al. through sol-gel combustion,
with Sr2+ ions affecting structural variations. The
NPs have a crystalline size of 34.07-36.32 nm, a
pure phase, and decreased magnetic values with
increased temperature fluctuation. The sample
heated to 200°C had the highest Ms value. These
Co1xSrxFe2O4
NPs
exhibited
diminishing
effectiveness in removing MB dye, with the sample
subjected to a temperature of 500°C for 45 minutes
showing the maximum efficacy at 72%.[148]
4.3 Tri-metal spinel ferrites:
Huixin et al. found a mesoporous magnet made of
NiFe2O4 and ZnCuCr-LDH that was easily
hydrothermally created from saccharin wastewater
and its potential for use in wastewater treatment by
practical adsorption. During the procedure, iron was
completely recirculated and about 83% COD of the
saccharin effluent was eliminated. It may be inferred
that electrostatic attraction and anion exchange
accounted for most of the adsorption mechanism.
The porous magnet composite as-prepared exhibits
excellent adsorption capability and a straightforward
synthesis and separation method, indicating good
potential to recirculate the waste metal for use in
realistic wastewater treatment applications. [149]
Scientists addressed two challenges in wastewater
treatment with photocatalysis: reducing the
catalyst's energy requirement and simplifying its
removal after treatment. Their solution involved
designing magnetic NCs that can be easily
separated. These catalysts were made by combining
magnetic NPs (Co0.5Zn0.25M0.25Fe2O4, where M
varied by Mg, Mn, Cu and Ni) with a specific sugar
molecule (carboxymethyl cellulose) and then coprecipitating them with a base. Next, the magnetic
NPs were integrated with titanium dioxide using a
template and a titanium source. A key feature of
these NCs is that the magnetic NPs allow the
titanium dioxide to be activated by visible light,
enabling them to function under sunlight. [150]
Jianping et al. explored a novel class of high-entropy
(HE) spinel ferrites for wastewater treatment
applications.
Their
research
focused
on

(Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)Fe2O4 a newly developed
ferrite material synthesized using the solution
combustion method followed by heat treatment
(500-1500 °C). This study marks the first application
of these HE spinel ferrites as catalysts in a
heterogeneous peroxodisulfate reaction for
wastewater treatment. The results revealed that the
HE spinel ferrite/PDS system exhibited superior
efficiency in removing organic pollutants, such as
RhB and tetracycline (TC), compared to the baseline
reaction conditions. The degradation process was
found to be significantly influenced by both
hydroxyl and sulfate radicals generated during the
reaction. Notably, this catalyst demonstrated
remarkable catalytic activity and excellent stability
throughout the study, highlighting its potential as a
promising candidate for real-world wastewater
treatment applications.[151] Dongmei et al.
investigated the potential of ceramic membranes
(CMs) for removing heavy metal contaminants.
Their study focused on creating a cost-effective and
durable CM from readily available waste materials.
This innovative approach involved sintering a
matrix of iron-sulfur-rich gold tailings and siliconrich marine mussel powder, combined with
copper/cobalt-rich precursors. The resulting wasteto-resource conversion material, designated CM(Cu-Co)Fe2O4, demonstrated exceptional efficiency
in removing heavy metal iron ions from water,
achieving a removal rate exceeding 94%. This
remarkable performance is attributed to a
combination of electrostatic attraction and
adsorption mechanisms.
Dongmei et al.'s research highlights the feasibility of
using common solid waste as a source material for
the development of multifunctional ceramic
membranes.[152] Researchers employed a solutioncombustion technique to synthesize indium-doped
cobalt-zinc spinel nano-ferrites (Co0.9Zn0.1InxFe2xO4). The study investigated the electrical properties
of these materials, focusing on their dielectric
constant and loss tangent. Interestingly, both
parameters decreased with increasing frequency but
increased with rising temperatures. Importantly, the
research achieved low dielectric loss tangent values,
making these nano-ferrites promising candidates for
applications involving microwave frequencies.[153] A
new approach to wastewater treatment utilizes
biochar derived from banana peels. The biochar is
first created using a molten salt technique. Then, a
one-pot hydrothermal process incorporates Mn, Zn,
and Fe trimetallic spinel onto the biochar, forming a
composite named MZF-BC. This MZF-BC
demonstrates exceptional tetracycline adsorption,
reaching a maximum capacity of 142.4 mg/g.

Researchers believe pore filling, coordination with
TC functional groups, and interactions within the
biochar structure contribute to this high adsorption.
Additionally,
MZF-BC
exhibits
promising
reusability, retaining over 70% of its adsorption
capacity after five regeneration cycles.[154] In a study
by Ahmed et al., flash auto combustion was
employed to synthesize single-phase spinel
nanoferrites containing rare earth elements (Sm, Pr,
Ce, and La). These nanoferrites exhibited potential
for colored wastewater treatment. Notably,
lanthanum (La)-doped ferrites demonstrated the
highest dye removal efficiency (92%), followed by
praseodymium (Pr) at 85%. Conversely, ferrites
doped with Sm) and Ce exhibited lower efficiencies
(80% and 72%, respectively). Doping ferrites with
La and Pr resulted in the formation of nanowires,
leading to improved conductivity. This discovery
represents a major leap forward in utilizing
nanomaterials
for
wastewater
treatment
applications.[155] A study explored the potential of
cadmium (Cd) and cobalt (Co) doped zinc ferrites
for wastewater treatment applications.
These
catalysts were synthesized using a simple sol-gel
method. Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated
by measuring the degradation of MO dye in the
presence of visible light. The research identified a
specific composition (Cd0.75Zn0.25Co0.25Fe1.75O4)
that exhibited the highest degradation rate (82%) in
2 hours of visible light irradiation. This superior
performance is likely due to the presence of
favourable atomic arrangements within the
material's structure and its ability to minimize the
recombination of electrons and holes, which can
hinder
photocatalytic
activity.[156]
Cd0.5Cu0.5xAgxFe2O4 ferrites were studied by Ahmed
H., et al. and made using a straightforward coprecipitation process. The standard organic impurity
indigo carmine dye (IC), a byproduct of dyeing
indigo, was oxidatively broken down using the

samples as catalysts. In the pH range of 2–11,
Cd0.5Cu0.5–xAgxFe2O4 showed good catalytic
activity, making them promising, stable, and
effective materials for Fenton-based alkaline
wastewater treatment.[157] Researchers investigated a
rapid and cost-effective method (sol-gel and selfcombustion) to synthesize scandium (Sc)-doped
nickel-cobalt ferrite NPs (Ni0.5Co0.5ScxFe2xO4). The
resulting materials exhibited nanoscale crystallinity
(ranging from 35 to 42 nm). The study explored the
impact of Sc substitution on the catalytic activity of
these ferrites. This was evaluated by analyzing the
flameless combustion of acetone, propane, and
benzene in the presence of the different samples. The
findings revealed a clear benefit of replacing some
iron (Fe3+) ions with Sc3+ ions within the ferrite
structure. Notably, the Sc-doped catalysts achieved
conversion rates exceeding 90% for acetone or
propane at a temperature of 400°C. This enhanced
catalytic activity compared to pure Ni-Co ferrites is
likely due to a combination of factors, including
smaller crystallite size, larger specific surface area,
and the incorporation of Sc cations within the
material's structure.[158] Researchers investigated
magnesium-zinc nanoferrites doped with cobalt for
wastewater treatment. A simple combustion method
produced
Mg0.5Zn0.4Co0.1Fe2O4,
Mg0.4Zn0.5Co0.1Fe2O4, and Mg0.5Zn0.5Co0.1Fe1.9O4.
The synthesized catalysts underwent structural,
optical, and magnetic characterization. Notably, the
Z5C1 catalyst achieved impressive photocatalytic
activity under UV-visible light, degrading 97.76% of
CV dye in 90 minutes. This efficiency is attributed
to the Z5C1's low charge carrier recombination and
suitable band gap. Scavenger studies suggest holes
play a key role in breaking down CV dye. The Z5C1
catalyst's reusability and magnetic separation
potential highlight its promise for degrading organic
pollutants.[159]

4.4 Rare earth doped metal ferrites:
Researchers used the citrate combustion method to
create Co-Cu-Sm nano ferrites, effectively removing
RhB dye from polluted water. The band gaps of
these nanoferrites decrease when Sm3+ ions are
added. The nano ferrite with x = 0.15 achieved a
94.36% degradation rate within 270 minutes,
indicating their potential application in wastewater
treatment.[160] Singh, Sneha, and colleagues have
discovered that magnetically recoverable spinel
nanoferrites doped with samarium (Sm) can
effectively be photocatalysts for removing organic
contaminants from wastewater. They produced a
series of Sm-doped spinel nano ferrites,
MSmxFe2exO4 (M= Ni, Co), using the sol-gel method
and systematically studied the influence of Sm
doping on the pure nanoferrites structural,
morphological, optical, and magnetic properties.
The synthesized materials were subsequently
evaluated as photocatalysts to facilitate the oxidative
decomposition of dyes (MO and safranin O) and
antibiotics (ofloxacin and norfloxacin). The
increased surface area of Sm-doped nanoferrites, Sm
ions' affinity for the octahedral location, and their
smaller band gap contributed to their remarkable
catalytic efficacy. These nanoferrites are highly
recyclable, making them ideal for wastewater
treatment photocatalysts.[161] A study investigated
the use of a non-toxic sol-gel process to create
nickel-zinc ferrite nanostructures (Ni0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4
and Ni0.6Zn0.2Ce0.2Fe2O4) with cubic shapes. These
NPs exhibited remarkable effectiveness in

hydrothermal

[157]
[158]

eliminating harmful bacteria present in sewage
samples. The results suggest that magnetic NPs
(MNPs) hold promise as powerful tools for sewage
treatment by eliminating harmful bacteria. Notably,
the nickel-zinc-cerium ferrite demonstrated superior
performance compared to the other two ferrite types
in suppressing microbial growth.[162] Basfer, N.M et
al. synthesized cobalt-magnesium ferrites doped
with the rare earth element cerium (Ce) with the
chemical
formula
Co0.7Mg0.3CexFe2-xO4
(abbreviated as CMCF) by a combustion technique
to generate a highly efficient nano-photocatalyst
capable of removing harmful dyes. Although the
CMCF nanoferrites used a bigger ion (Ce) instead of
a smaller ion (Fe), the lattice parameter and
crystallite size exhibited an unexpected pattern,
reducing from 8.4077 to 8.3922 and 34.66 to 20.76
nm, respectively. The CMCF (x = 0.1) photocatalyst
was used to induce four distinct stages in the MB
degradation process. The CMCF NPs hold great
potential as efficient photocatalysts for eliminating
harmful MB in wastewater treatment processes.[163]
Irfan, M. et al. produced a wide variety of
Co0.5Cd0.5Fe2-xCexO4
(CoCdCeFO) nanoferrites
using the sol-gel method. The presence of Ce3+ in the
Co-Cd photocatalyst did not have a substantial
impact on its photocatalytic activity throughout the
range of x = 0 to 0.04. However, the photocatalytic
activity of Co-Cd exhibited a noticeable decrease as
the Ce3+ concentration increased. Hence, the
incorporation of a small quantity of Ce 3+ in Co-Cd
samples enhances the photocatalytic activity under
visible light.[164]

Researchers investigated a sol-gel auto-combustion
technique to synthesize undoped and dysprosium
(Dy3+)-doped zinc-magnesium (Zn-Mg) NCs. The
effectiveness of these NCs for degrading a model
organic dye (MG dye) under sunlight irradiation was
evaluated. The study revealed that ZM3, a specific
composition of the doped NCs, exhibited the highest
degradation efficiency, reaching 94.23%.
An
additional advantage of these NCs is their ease of
separation from the treated water using an external
magnet due to their magnetic properties.[165]
Keerthana, et al. prepared two photocatalysts for
degrading dye components. Ce-doped CuFe2O4 and
Sm-loaded ZnFe2O4 NPs prepared successfully. The
created Ce-doped CuFe2O4 substance demonstrated
photocatalytic activity and promoted RhB

and

[172]

degradation. The outcomes showed that adding a
catalyst significantly increased the effectiveness of
RhB degradation. The dye solution with no CuFe2O4
added the dye solution with 1% Ce and 2% Ce doped
CuFe2O4 added, and the dye solution with CuFe2O4
added were 48%, 50%, 66%, and 88%, respectively,
after two hours of irradiation UV light. The samples
produced were pure, with 1% and 2% Samariumdoped ZnFe2O4. The cationic dye MB underwent
degradation when it was exposed to visible light. In
a few hours, the Sm-doped ZnFe2O4 NPs, with a 2%
concentration, successfully eliminated 65% of the
dye. This indicates that the sample exhibits
resistance to the degradation of MB cationic dye.
These Sm-loaded ZnFe2O4 NPs were stable for a
period above three cycles. These findings proved

that these two photocatalysts effectively degrade the
RhB and MB dyes. [166, 168] Sharma et al. successfully
created yttrium-doped CoFe2O4, a magnetic
photocatalyst with the chemical formula CoYxFe2xO4 with outstanding catalytic activity. The primary
goal of the current research is to change the catalytic
activity of CoFe2O4; as a result, the photo-Fenton
reaction with H2O2 and PMS two various inorganic
oxidants was chosen. Regardless of the inorganic
oxidant used, the data showed that Y3+ doping
increased catalytic activity compared to pure
CoFe2O4.[167] M.A. Abdo et al. prepared Cesubstituted Zn-Mn ferrite NPs using a
straightforward combustion method. The nano
ferrite
Zn0.5Mn0.5Ce0.08Fe1.92O4
demonstrated
moderate magnetism (36.94 emu/g) and the lowest
coercivity, making it highly suitable for soft ferrite
applications in high-frequency technology and
communication.
The
Zn0.5Mn0.5Ce0.08Fe1.92O4
photocatalyst demonstrated excellent photocatalytic

efficacy for RhB and superior stability. It’s simple
synthesis method, superior magnetic characteristics,
and excellent stability make it a promising candidate
for high-frequency applications and large-scale
pollution treatment.[169] Li et al. created a
photocatalyst (figure-5) supported by threedimensional ordered microporous silica to activate
PMS and degrade BPA using visible light. The
photocatalyst, n-CeO2@p-LaFeO3/3DOM SiO2,
demonstrated exceptional photocatalytic efficiency
due to the catalysts' pore confinement effects and the
combined influence of LaFeO3 and CeO2. The
researchers have shown that the breakdown of BPA
occurs via the generation and identification of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as through
adsorption and diffusion processes. The researchers
determined that n-CeO2@p-LaFeO3/3DOM SiO2
has great potential as a sustainable material for
effective sewage treatment.[170]

Andrei et al. did research where they used the Fenton
method to examine the catalytic activity of
lanthanide-doped
magnesium
ferrites.
The
lanthanide ions used for doping were La3+, Ce3+,
Sm3+, Gd3+, and Dy3+. Under the study, the catalytic
efficacy of the catalysts, as measured by the
maximum appearance rate constant k, declined in
the following sequence when exposed to UV
irradiation: Ce3+ > Dy3+ > La3+ MgFe2O4 > Sm3+ >
Gd3+. The ferrites demonstrated excellent efficiency,
achieving a degradation rate of up to 99% for MB
within 60 minutes for visible-driven Fenton
reactions, and within 20 mins for UV-driven Fenton
reactions. Also, the investigation demonstrated that
the outcomes were similar to those of other
heterogeneous Fenton catalysts.[171] A study
explored Ce-doped manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4)
for wastewater treatment and sensing. A simple
solution combustion method synthesized Ce-doped

MnFe2O4 (MFC3). This magnetic photocatalyst
demonstrated excellent performance, degrading
98% and 89% of MB and AR dyes in the presence
of sunlight (Figure 6). MFC3 also showed promise
in sensing D-glucose and paracetamol from water.
Utilizing magnetic properties facilitated MFC3's
fabrication and characterization. These findings
suggest that MFC3 has the potential as a
multifunctional material for wastewater treatment
(photocatalysis), biomedicine (soft magnetism), and
sensor
technology
(detecting
specific
molecules).[172]
5. Based on different materials
5.1. Polymer-based ferrites:
According to Kumar M. et al., magnetic biopolymer
beads consisting of zinc ferrite and alginate (ZFNAlg) are an affordable alternative for eliminating Pb
(II) and Cu (II) metal ions from both single and
binary systems, as found in the current work. When
Pb (II) and Cu (II) ions were investigated for
adsorption on ZFN-Alg beads in batch mode, the
results revealed that these beads still had a
regeneration effectiveness of about 80% even after
five cycles. This study highlights the promise of
magnetic biopolymer beads as a practical and costeffective solution for removing lead (Pb(II)) and
copper (Cu(II)) ions from contaminated water.[173]
Atul Sharma, et al. produced a magnetic NC made
of cobalt ferrite and occimum sanctum. The analysis
revealed that the NC has strong magnetic
characteristics and could be an economical
adsorbent for wastewater treatment technologies. It
was examined for its capability to adsorb MB and
CV, two cationic dyes, and both tests revealed a high
capacity. As a result of these findings, the Cobalt
ferrite-Occimum sanctum NC is a promising
contender for wastewater treatment applications.[174]
Chitosan beads entrapping magnetic cobalt ferrite
with amine functionalization (NH2-CF-CB) are a
cost-effective and highly efficient adsorbent. These
beads possess exceptional adsorption capabilities,
making them ideal for reducing water pollution.
They can effectively remove MG, an organic
pollutant, as well as Cu (II) ions, an inorganic
contaminant. In addition, these beads are reusable
and can be easily separated from the water. The
Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was used to
evaluate the maximum adsorption capacities of MG
and Cu (II) ions on NH2-CF-CB. The maximum
adsorption capacity for MG was found to be 357.16
mg/g, while for Cu (II) ions, it was 158.73 mg/g.[175]
Joshi et al. made PANI and Mn0.25Co0.75Fe2O4
(MCF) NCs with 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 weight
percentages of MCF to break down CV dye under
sun radiation. PANI/MCF NCs were made by in-situ

chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline. XRD
and FTIR showed pure phase development in all
samples. MCF and PANI/MCF crystallite diameters
were 20–30 nm. PANI/MCF NCs with 10 and 20
wt% MCF degrade CV dye efficiently. The
degradation efficiency of 10 and 20 wt%
PANI/MCF NCs was 77% and 89% in 75 mins. The
research showed that heterogeneous photocatalysts
with reduced optical band gaps work. Maximum
degradation rate constants were 0.5 and 0.7 min-1
for PANI/MCF NCs with 10 and 20 wt% MCF.[176]
Hosseini et al. synthesized CoFe2O4 NPs by a simple
chemical precipitation technique. The dialytic rate
of the magnetic PVC-CoFe2O4 membrane was
superior to that of the pristine PVC membrane in
removing chromium ions. The considerable affinity
of NPs with magnetic properties for heavy metal ion
adsorption is the main reason for this effect.[177]
Kaur, et al. explained the ES technique used to
create a novel nanofiber membrane consisting of
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-PVDF. The Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs
were synthesized using the sol-gel combustion
method. The results of their comprehensive analysis
suggest that spintronics devices, magnetic sensors,
and ferrite-based nanofiber membranes have a high
potential for competition.[100] A.R. Sadrolhosseini et
al. produced composite layers of polypyrrole,
chitosan, and nickel-ferrite NPs at varied times using
the electrochemical method. The surface plasmon
resonance technique was then used to analyze the
PPy-Chi/NiFe2O4-NPs to find heavy metal ions in
aqueous solutions, such as Ni, Fe, Co, Al, Mn, Hg,
and Pb. Comparing the sensing layer to other
sensing layers, including polypyrrole and
polypyrrole chitosan, it showed a better capacity to
detect paramagnetic substances and was proven to
be more sensitive.[178] Abou Hammad, A.B. et al.
produced a biodegradable, semiconducting, and
antibacterial cellulosic composite that in-situ
polymerizes PANI in the presence of cellulose. This
composite magnetic property was obtained by
adding cobalt ferrite NPs (CFO-NPs) during the
polymerization process. The CFO-NPs produced by
the sol-gel method had an average particle size of
less than 50 nm. Because of its exceptional
biodegradability and antibacterial efficacy against
Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus
subtilis, the electromagnetic NC was generated. [179]
Tatarchuk, et al. developed a magnetic core-shell
adsorbent by immobilizing TiO2 nanoclusters on the
cobalt ferrite NPs. Ethylene glycol and citric acid
were used as chelating agents in a modified Pechini
sol-gel synthesis. They conducted a detailed analysis
of the shape and structure of pure CoFe2O4,
reference TiO2, and the resulting CoFe2O4@TiO2
NC shown in Figure 7. The CoFe2O4@TiO2 NC was

found to have an adsorption efficacy that was more
than twice as high as that of TiO2 and CoFe2O4
alone. The observed synergistic effect can only be
attributed to the formation of deformed titania
nanocrystals. The magnetic nano adsorbents that
were found were successful in eliminating
dichromate anions (83% removal) and CR dye (61%
removal) from water.[180]

CoFe2O4@TiO2 NC and (b) a surface layer of

Giri et al. have researched the biomedical
applications of substituted ferrites [Fe1-xBxFe2O4,
B=Mn, Co]. Superparamagnetic ferrites and
ferrofluids containing fatty acids have been
synthesized by use of the co-precipitation process.
Fe1-xMnxFe2O4 may have uses in biological
applications, such as MRI contrast agents and cancer
therapy for hyperthermia. They also studied GOmanganese ferrite (GMF) to remove As (V) ions
through adsorption-filtration. The newly created
adsorptive MMMs have the potential to be used as a
single treatment approach for the removal of As (V)
ions.[181] Polymer bimetal complexes were utilised to
synthesise nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon
embedded with NiFe2O4-NC, which was then
employed to extract Hg2+ from aqueous medium.
The proposed method employs a single-source
precursor to create NiFe2O4 nanocrystals
incorporated into a nitrogen-doped graphitised
carbon matrix. This technique can produce an
extremely effective magnetic adsorbent to eliminate
harmful pollutants from contaminated water.[182]

Malana, M.A. et al. used the chemical coprecipitation technique to synthesize a 13 nm-sized
aluminium-doped nano manganese copper ferrite.
The ferrite was then impregnated with methacrylate,
vinyl acetate, and acrylic acid polymer by a gradual
heating process to produce NC. An NC was used to
extract arsenic from aqueous solutions.[183] Zareei, F
et al. utilised Composite CoFe2O4/CuO NPs to
produce nanofiltration membranes based on mixed
matrix polyethersulfone (PES). The blended [PES0.5 wt% CoFe2O4/CuO] membrane exhibited a
rejection rate of 98%, 92%, and 88% for Cu2+, Ni2+,
and Pb2+ respectively, whereas the pure PES
membrane exhibited a rejection rate of 85%, 80%,
and 78% for the same metal ions. The blended
membrane exhibited superior reusability with a
marginal decline of less than 4.9% in average
performance.[184] In a fixed bed column, binary dyes
were removed using an alginate-cobalt ferrite (ACF)
as a nanosorbent. The bed depth and flow rate
caused the binary adsorption. The study showed that
a considerable bed depth and a reduced flow rate
were needed to effectively sequestrate binary dyes.
The characteristics of the ACF in powder form are
ideal candidates: easy preparation, cheap cost,
biocompatibility,
renewable,
mechanical
separability, no formation of secondary pollutants,
and environmental friendliness. The outcomes
demonstrated ACF's efficiency when applied to
eliminate binary dyes.[185] Researchers employed
nitrilotriacetic acid (NA) as a chelating agent to
coordinate with iron (Fe(II)) and manganese
(Mn(II)) ions in various ratios during the thermal
decomposition synthesis of porous magnetic ferrite
nanowires. Two distinct types of nanowires were
successfully produced: one containing pure
MnFe2O4 and another containing manganese-doped
Fe3O4. These porous nanowires demonstrate a
remarkable ability to remove heavy metal ions and
organic pollutants from wastewater. The research
suggests that these magnetic ferrites have broader
applicability in fields beyond water treatment,
potentially extending to areas like biotechnology
and lithium-ion battery technology.[188] Martins, et
al. focused on creating novel magnetoelectric (ME)
material polymer NCs that display a customised ME
response at room temperature. The three distinct
ferrite NPs, Zn0.2Mn0.8Fe2O4 (ZMFO), CoFe2O4
(CFO), and Fe3O4 (FO), are the basis for the
multiferroic NCs, which are disseminated in a
matrix of the piezoelectric copolymer poly
(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene, or P(VDFTrFE)). The ME response of ZMFO/P(VDF-TrFE),

on the other hand, revealed little hysteresis and a
strong dependency on the ZMFO filler content.
Potential novel uses have been discussed for these
ferrite/PVDF NCs, including memories and
information storage, signal processing, ME sensors,
and oscillators.[189] An in situ chemical oxidation
method was used by Katowah, D. F., et al. to create
nanostructured ternary NCs made up of chitosan
(CS), CoFe2O4 (CF) NPs and a Poly (Pyrrole-co-OToluidine) matrix (P(Py-coOT)). A Co2+ ion
detection electrochemical sensor was made using
P(Py-co-OT)/CF/CS NCs. The CS and P(Py-co-OT)
layers are applied uniformly to the CF NPs. The
P(Py-co-OT)/CF/CS NCs are promising Co2+ ion
sensors due to their excellent detection limit,
sensitivity, and electrical interaction. For values
between 0.1 nM and 0.1 mM, the Co2+ sensor
responded to Co2+ linearly. The performance and
response times of the proposed Co2+ ion sensor are
satisfactory and repeatable. [186] Jayalakshmi, R. et
al. researched the structural characterization of the
ex-situ produced alginate-cobalt ferrite NC
(CoFe2O4-ANa NC), the current communication's
primary focus. CoFe2O4 NPs stabilisation of sodium
alginate has been demonstrated by the
characterisation results. As a result, the alginatecobalt ferrite NC was shown to have enhanced
particle distribution, fewer and smaller particle
agglomerates, increased crystallinity, and increased
surface area. [190] Researchers investigated the
potential of a composite material, MFN-alginate, for
removing dyes from wastewater. MFN-alginate is
comprised of magnetic ferrite NPs and alginate. The
study assessed its ability to remove model dyes
(Basic Blue 9, Basic Blue 41, and Basic Red 18)
from both individual dye solutions (single systems)
and mixtures of these dyes (binary systems).[187]
5.2 Carbon-based metal ferrites composites
Researchers investigated the influence of metal
ferrite NPs (MFNPs) on biohydrogen production
through thermophilic dark fermentation of milk
processing wastewater (MPWW). The MFNPs
consist of NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and CuFe2O4 NPs.
Chemical coprecipitation was used to create the
MFNPs, which were then characterised. The
characterisation results showed that the average
nanocrystallite diameters of the NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4,
and CuFe2O4 spinels were 25.8 nm, 33 nm, and 20.7
nm, respectively. The prepared NPs were pure and
exhibited ferromagnetic properties.[191] Mona

Moradi et al. aimed to improve wastewater
treatment by using spinel cobalt ferrite (SCF) NPs
coupled with g-C3N4 in their UVC/persulfate
technique. As a model recalcitrant pollutant, they
examined the breakdown of BPA to assess how well
their strategy worked. The team's investigations
revealed that SCF@g-C3N4 produced practically,
had more excellent photocatalytic activity and
superior PS activation capabilities than either pure
SCF or g-C3N4. The novel technique was also
successful in treating wastewater samples that were
BPA-contaminated. After five catalyst reuse cycles,
the system removed more than 95% of the BPA,
demonstrating the potential for SCF@g-C3N4 to be
a cost-effective wastewater treatment method. The
results indicate that this method can potentially
intensify wastewater treatment through synergy.[192]
Wu et al. have shown that electro-peroxone, a
combination of ozonation and electrolysis utilizing a
carbon-polytetrafluoroethylene cathode, is an
effective method for treating the growing
contaminant diatrizoate (DTZ) in water. The
researchers synthesized cathodic catalysts by
modifying carbon nanotubes with ferrite
(MFe2O4/CNTs, M: Fe, Mn). They determined that
these catalysts were well-suited and showed great
promise for this specific method. These results
indicate that using electro-peroxide with cathodic
materials and MFe2O4/CNTs catalysts is a feasible
approach for breaking down DTZ in an
aqueous solution.[193] Yao et al. conducted a study
on the enhancement of crystallinity, thermostability,
and magnetization of γ-Fe2O3 and ferrites NCs by
co-modifying them with carbon nanotubes (γFe2O3/MFe2O4/CNTs, M: Co, Cu, and Mn). The
purpose of this modification was to improve the
capacity of the NCs to adsorb and eliminate CPX
from wastewater. The presence of γ-Fe2O3 changed
the way CPX is adsorbed on MFe2O4/CNTs and γFe2O3/MFe2O4/CNTs. The investigation revealed

that the adsorption interaction and capacity of the
copper and manganese ferrite systems were
governed by CNTs and γ-hematite (γ-Fe2O3). The
study's results highlight the role of magnetic
materials, which may be used to create identical
adsorbents for environmental applications.[194]
Nadeem et al. used coal fly ash (CFA) to
manufacture copper ferrite NCs. These NCs were
specifically designed for photocatalytic degradation
of MO dye. The researchers used hydrothermal
synthesis to produce NPs of pure copper ferrite and
copper ferrite NC of CFA. The NC photocatalyst
demonstrated improved physicochemical properties,
facilitating the effective degradation of MO,
reaching a maximum of 98% under optimum
conditions.[195] Jelokhani et al. effectively produced
cobalt ferrite (CF) NCs containing rGO and CNT by
using the simple co-precipitation method at low
temperatures. The CF-CNT NC exhibited the
greatest dark adsorption capacity and best
effectiveness in decomposing MB at all
concentrations. The CF-CNT NC exhibited a
photocatalytic efficiency of 97% under visible light,
resulting in the decomposition of a 10 mg/L MB
solution during a 180-minute reaction period. This
effectiveness was 1.8 times higher than that of the
CF-rGO NC and up to 2.5 times higher than that of
pure CF NPs.[196]
Cobalt hexaferrite NPs were made by Ansari, F et al.
for the first time utilising the sol-gel process and
organic reducing agents (carbohydrates and
pigments). According to the band gap estimate made
by DRS, these goods can function as active
photocatalysts. Therefore, MO degradation was
examined under UV irradiation in the presence of
the finished goods. The findings indicate that the
graphene-based NC exhibits higher photocatalytic
activity compared to both the CNT-based NC and
the pure NPs.[197]

Wang et al. synthesized nanohybrid composite
[MFe2O4 (M = Co, Mn)–MoS2–Carbon dots (CD)]
mentioned samples named at MnFMC and CoFMC
with highly efficient removal of Pb (II) from water.
In this study synthesized composites showed strong
Pb (II) adsorption performances at 588.24 mg/g for
MnFMC composite and 660.67 mg/g for CoFMC
composite. These composites also showed a
preference for Pb (II) sorption despite the presence
of strong competition from Ca (II) and Mg (II)
cations. The nanohybrid adsorbents' remarkable
reusability makes them attractive choices for water
filtration. They can lower effluent Pb (II) values to
the ppb level, which satisfies the WHO drinking
water standard recommendation.[198] Ahangari, A. et
al. created two magnetic adsorbents, Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4
Ferrite
(NZF)
and
Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4/CNTs
(CNZF/CNTs) NC, via inverse co-precipitation.
These two adsorbents have a fast magnetic response
that may be separated from the solution using a
magnetic field. From the experimental results of As
(V) adsorption CNZF/CNTs shows higher
maximum adsorption capacity than NZF. These two
NCs used to remove the As (V) from the industrial
effluent.[199] Verma et al. developed magnetic
MgFe2O4 NPs (MMFNPs) using the sol-gel method.
Ultrasonography coated MWCNTs with these NPs
to form MMF composites. Prepared materials were
tested for heavy metal wastewater remediation. Cr
(VI) adsorption onto as-produced MMFNC suited
the Langmuir model best. MMFNC are cheap
because their magnetic properties make them easy to

extract from aqueous solutions. The MMFNC
removed Cr (VI) ions with less than 20% efficiency
loss after seven adsorption-desorption cycles.[200]
Wu et al. constructed magnetic ferrite-modified
carbon nanotubes (MFe2O4/CNTs, M: Mn or Co) to
remove bezafibrate (BZF) from water. From these
experiments, Wu et al.
observed
that
MnFe2O4/CNTs adsorb BZF better than
CoFe2O4/CNTs. Results reveal that MFe2O4/CNTs
might adsorb BZF from aqueous solutions.[201] Luan,
et al. made CuFe2O4 particles hydrothermally. These
particles were added to stacked CNT membranes to
remove arsenite [As (III)] from drinking water.
Drinking water treatment conditions were used to
evaluate the composite membrane. CuFe2O4
particles were retained by the CNT membrane and
did not enter the filtered water. The composite
membrane eliminated over 90% of As (III) under
different solution chemical conditions. As (III)
removal from drinking water is promising via the
novel composite membrane.[202] Ramaraj et al.
proposed a simple hydrothermal approach for
making BFO nanosheets with functionalized carbon
nanofiber. Electrochemical catechol detection was
also performed on the BFO NS/F-CNF NC-modified
glassy carbon electrode (GCE). As projected,
BiFeO3 NS/F-CNF/GCE has strong electrocatalytic
activity and electrochemical redox responses 3.44
and 7.92 fold higher for catechol sensing.[203]

5.3 agricultural waste based spinel ferrites
Guo et al. developed amine-functionalized rice bran
biochar/MgFeAlO4
(RB@MgFeAlO4-NH2)
magnetic composites using a one-step solvothermal
method. They found that the RB@MgFeAlO4-NH2
magnetic composite could remove hazardous Ni (II)
from wastewater. Experimental results show the
composite can accept 201.62 mg g-1 Ni (II). Due to
its environmental friendliness, inexpensive cost,
magnetic separation ease, and high sorption
capacity, RB@MgFeAlO4-NH2 may be used to
remove Ni(II) from aqueous solutions at a low
cost.[204] In treating organic
wastewater,
adsorbent/ferrite composites can adsorb and
decompose organics. Ying et al. used microwave
radiation to treat organic wastewater using a rice
hull/MnFe2O4 composite (RHM) created through
calcination in a nitrogen atmosphere. This is
believed because MnFe2O4 is present, which
increases RHM's catalytic activity. Water washing
can renew RHM. However, RHM's surface area and
maximal COD removal rate decline for each
regeneration cycle. This
innovative
rice
hull/MnFe2O4 composite has the benefits of low cost
and quick processing, and it may find promising use
as a wastewater treatment agent.[205] A new NC
adsorbent known as ALW/CoFe2O4 was produced
by Suba et al. by auto-combusting Apocynaceae leaf
waste-activated carbon (ALW) and CoFe2O4. This
compound's antibacterial and dye-elimination
properties were examined against S. aureus, E. coli,

and C. albicans. The outcomes demonstrated that the
synthetic ALW/CoFe2O4 has antimicrobial activity
comparable to that of the common antibacterial
(Streptomycin) and antifungal (Amphotericin B)
medications, with a zone of inhibition spanning from
11 to 17.56 mm. With varying concentrations (100500 mg), the good diffusion method was used to
evaluate the antibacterial activity against S. aureus
and E. coli and the antifungal static efficacy against
C. albicans.[206] Saleh et al. generated activated
carbon (AC) from willow catkins using chemical
modification techniques. Using a one-step
hydrothermal process, they loaded the AC with
nickel ferrite NCs. The researchers found that the
45NFAC photocatalyst was the most efficient,
degrading 99.7% of RhB dye in just 90 mins under
simulated sunshine. The NFAC NCs are dependable,
efficient, and reusable, making them a viable
photocatalyst
for
water
environmental
remediation.[207] A new type of biochar was
developed by Bai et al. (figure-8) In this study, spinel
ferrite was loaded onto straw using the sol-gel
technique. This study examined the impact of
various environmental factors and preparation
methods on biochar's adsorption characteristics.
Additionally, ion-competitive adsorption tests
examined ion interference and preference. To
maximize biochar recovery and reuse, magnetic
determination and recycling tests were done. This
research contributes to straw-based biochar
adsorption
for
heavy
metal
wastewater
treatment.[208]

effectiveness and was compared to NPs and CQDs
to investigate the degradation of nitroaromatic
pollutants (namely p-nitrophenol, Martius yellow,
and pendimethalin) when exposed to visible light.
The findings indicated that NC including CQDs and
Sr0.4Ti0.6Fe2O4.6 in a weight-to-volume ratio of 2:1
had excellent photocatalytic activity. The
degradation efficiencies ranged from 91.2% to
97.4%, surpassing the range of 65.0% to 88.3% seen
for pure NPs and CQDs.[209] Zirconium ferrite NCs
(BC-ZrFe2O5 NCs) mediated by biochar were
created by Perveen, Shazia, and colleagues with
biochar derived from wheat straw. These NCs were
employed to remove Tartrazine dye from textile
effluent through adsorption. The study indicates that
nano adsorbents can be created effectively and used
as affordable and practical materials for real-world
industrial engineering applications. It's worth noting
that the NCs were recovered in five cycles and still
retained an impressive adsorption efficiency, with
only a marginal reduction from 89% to 63%.[210]
Algethami et al. used butchered cow bones from the
Najran region of Saudi Arabia to generate a

manganese ferrite and hydroxyapatite composite.
Their research sought to develop new composites
that can aid in water filtration using animal bone
waste, notably that from cows, in an economical and
environmentally responsible manner. The composite
they produced, which demonstrated excellent
photocatalytic activity against the industrial waste
pollutant MB dye, was made using the synthesised
hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2). In addition, the
synthetic
composite
exhibited
exceptional
bacteriostatic activity against the pathogens that
cause acute waterborne illnesses, S. aureus and E.
coli.[211]
Researchers have found a simple technique to create
composite materials by utilizing biochar made from
various agricultural waste. The procedure entails
synthesizing cobalt (II) ferrite onto the charcoal
surface and using chelate complexes of transition
metal cations with citric acid to produce composite
materials. These materials efficiently eliminate
chromium (VI) ions from water-based solutions,
making them valuable for the treatment of industrial
effluent.[212]

Alizadeh, Mehran et al. created a magnetic
adsorbent using chemical co-precipitation and
hydrolysed Luffa Cylindrica (HLC). This adsorbent
was tested for divalent nickel ion removal from
water. According to the study, adsorption
effectiveness declined as Ca2+ and Na+ cation
concentrations rose in the aqueous medium. The
synthesised adsorbents, however, continued to work
well even after eight reuse cycles. Furthermore,
during real wastewater treatment, the HLC/CoFe2O4
magnetic composite was discovered to be incredibly
successful at eliminating heavy metal contaminants
from shipbuilding effluent.[214] Zinatloo-Ajabshir, S
et al. have successfully developed a recyclable
photocatalyst called CoFe2O4@SiO2@Dy2Ce2O7
(CFO@SiO2@DCO), an MNC. The compound 2,2dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine was used as a novel
pH regulator in the synthesis of the Dy2Ce2O7
component and as a new crucial agent in the
manufacture of the silica component. The cobalt
ferrite was synthesized by combustion using grape
juice as an innovative and eco-friendly fuel source
(Synthesized steps given in Figure 10). This is the
first endeavour to evaluate the photocatalytic
efficiency of nanostructures composed of
(CFO@SiO2@DCO). In this study synthesized
nanostructure composite was used to effectively
degrade the MB, CV and RhB dyes in the presence
of UV irradiation. The results indicated that the
synthesized (CFO@SiO2@DCO) might serve as a
promising and beneficial photocatalyst for the
efficient removal of water contaminants, with an
additional advantage of being recyclable.[215] The
study focuses on examining and documenting the
effects of NC formulations, which consist of carbon
materials with high conductivity, metal enzyme
cofactors, and DIET activators, on enhancing the
generation of biogas from anaerobically incubated
cow dung in the context of anaerobic digestion
(AD). The three distinct formulations of NCs created
and manufactured by Fatma Y., et al. consist of zinc
ferrite (ZnFe), zinc ferrite blended with 10% carbon
nanotubes (ZFCNTs), and zinc ferrite combined

with 10% C76 fullerene (ZFC76). ZnFe exhibited a
methane production increase of 185.3% compared to
all other materials, making it the most significant
improvement. The use of ZFCNTs and ZFC76
resulted in a significant increase in methane
production, with boosts of 162% and 145.9%,
respectively, compared to the performance of the
control reactors. Also, the presence of these
substances increased the hydraulic retention
time.[216]
5.4 Fullerene-based spinel ferrites:
Hydrothermal synthesis of magnetic CoFe2O4/GO
adsorbents is simple. GO and magnetic CoFe2O4
adsorbents are produced by Chang, et al. using a
simple hydrothermal process. Here, a clear selective
adsorption behaviour can be shown, with MB > RhB
> MO being the order of adsorption capacity.
Theoretical simulations indicate that the primary
factors contributing to the adsorption of dye on GO
are electrostatic interaction and stacking interaction.
In addition, they conduct a theoretical investigation
on the notable impacts of GO defects and oxygencontaining functional groups on the efficacy of its
adsorption of organic dyes.[217] A one-step
hydrothermal
method
created
new
NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids with varying MWCNT
content. These hybrids are magnetically recyclable
and were used to examine the photocatalytic activity
of NiFe2O4/MWCNTs hybrids by Zhu, H-Y. et al.
The photocatalytic activity was determined by
measuring the rate of CR decolorisation in an
aqueous solution under simulated solar light
irradiation.[24] Dhiman et al. created a combination
of mixed-spinel ferrite and g-C3N4 to remove
antibiotic pollutants from wastewater. The
procedure consisted of three continuous steps:
pyrolysis, solution combustion, mechanical
grinding, and annealing, which were used to produce
a Z-scheme g-C3N4/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nano

heterojunction. The photocatalyst that was created
was assessed for its capacity to break down the
Doxycycline medication using natural sunlight. The
heterojunction had a peak deterioration efficiency of
97.10% during a 60-minute evaluation. The higher
photodegradation efficiency was a result of the
greater redox capacity and separation of
photoinduced charges facilitated by the Z-scheme
heterojunction between g-C3N4 and Ni-Zn
ferrite.[218] Wabaidur et al. have developed a new NC
that effectively eliminates cationic MB and celestine
blue (CB) dyes from water. The NC, consisting of

silica-coated
CuFe2O4-decorated
oxidised
MWCNTs (CuFe2O4/oMWCNTs), was synthesized
via co-precipitation and hydrothermal processes.
The regeneration studies showed that the highest
recovery of CB was obtained using acetonitrile
(ACN), while complete recovery of MB was
accomplished using methanol (MeOH). The
CuFe2O4/oMWCNTs NC is an exceptionally
excellent adsorbent for rapidly and effectively
decolorizing wastewater that contains cationic
dyes.[219]

Ghosh, B.K. et al. developed a non-hydrothermal
synthesis for producing TiO2/CoFe2O4/rGO NCs,
which are effective catalysts for breaking down
hazardous organic dyes.[221] Kodasma, et al.
conducted a study on the photocatalytic efficiency of
CuFe2O4XGO, which is a hybrid catalyst consisting
of CuFe2O4 and GO, to remove dyes. The findings
indicated that catalysts with varying weight ratios of
GO have great potential as practical options for
environmentally friendly wastewater treatment
methods.[222] Liu, Shou-Qing, and colleagues used a
single-location method to synthesize catalysts of
ZnFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 with rGO (ZnFe2O4/rGO).
The researchers found that the interaction between
Zn cations on ZnFe2O4 and ammonia in solution led

to the selective breakdown of ammonia and nitrogen
gas from a mixture of organic contaminant and
ammonia solution using the ZnFe2O4/rGO catalyst.
Under visible light exposure, the surface
photovoltage spectra indicated that the photogenerated holes migrated towards the surface of
ZnFe2O4 particles, resulting in the removal of
ammonia adsorbed on the catalyst surface.[223]
5.5 Semiconductor-based spinel ferrites:
Through their research, Saputra et al. explored the
potential of a hybrid semiconductor known as CTFZnFe2O4 catalysts to enhance the effectiveness of
visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of
pollutants. Their study discovered that a certain
proportion of CTF-ZnFe2O4, with a ratio of 90:10,
was successful in breaking down MB. The
degradation process achieved an efficiency rate of
95.4% and a kobs value of 0.421 min1. This was

achieved by utilizing 0.5 g/L dosages of CTFZnFe2O4 to degrade 50 mg/L of MB over 120 mins,
using a UV-vis light photocatalytic technique.[224]
Shu, Ruiwen, and colleagues fabricated hybrid
composites of nitrogen-doped MWCNT and cobaltzinc ferrite (NMWCNTs/Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4) by a onestep solvothermal process given in figure-12. The
microspheres were uniformly dispersed on the
surface of NMWCNTs, and the interconnecting of
NMWCNTs in the hybrid composites facilitated the
formation of 3D conductive networks in situ. The
research examined how the number of NMWCNTs
affected the electromagnetic properties and
microwave absorption behaviour of composites
made of NMWCNTs, Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4, and paraffin
wax. The observations indicated that the materials
could be easily manufactured, and the research
findings helped design highly effective microwave
absorbers based on MWCNTs and the structural
design of these materials.[225]

contaminated water for water treatment and
purification.[226]
5.6 Composite material-based spinel ferrites:
Tran, N.B.T., et al. utilised simple hydrothermal
procedures to produce a magnetic NC called
Fe3O4/zeolite NaA (Fe3O4/ZA), Fe3O4 NPs and
zeolite NaA. This NC helps remove MB from the
aqueous solution through adsorption. The adsorption
mechanism of MB molecules on the Fe3O4/ZA is the
result of the interaction between the active sites on
the surfaces and edges of inversion spinel ferrite
Fe3O4 NPs and zeolite NaA with MB molecules.
This method provides a simple, effective, and
scalable process to synthesise the magnetic
Fe3O4/ZA NC, which can be used as an inexpensive
adsorbent for wastewater treatment.[227] In a study by
Raghavendra, N. et al., CoFe2O4 and clay/CoFe2O4
were effectively produced and analysed. Results
showed that the combination of clay and CoFe2O4 is
a promising material for detecting heavy metals in
industrial wastewater treatments using various
chemicals and biosensors. This can aid in

environmental remediation efforts.[228] Magnetic
composite photocatalysts (Ag2O/MFe2O4) were
developed using three magnetic carriers, namely
ZnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and NiFe2O4. The amount of
silver utilised was reduced, which improved the
separation efficiency and lowered the operational
cost for practical applications. The outcomes of the
study demonstrate the excellent photocatalytic
performance and superior magnetic recovery rate of
the developed three magnetic composite
photocatalysts. These composites can photodegrade
common organic contaminants such as MO, MB,
RhB, and phenol. However, evaluating the silver
content, photocatalytic activity and stability, and
magnetic recovery rate following recycling testing
shows that Ag2O/ZnFe2O4 (60%) is the best
composite.[229] Zhang used the hydrothermal (ZFOH) and citrate sol-gel (ZFO-C) methods, to produce
the zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4, ZFO) catalysts. This study
compares the effectiveness of catalysts and noncatalytic ozonation in the oxidation of contaminants
and phenol in biologically treated coking wastewater
(BTCW), as well as to assess the kinetics of the
ozonation reaction. [121]

ZVAl is a promising substance for removing heavy
metals since it is a cost-effective addition with great
reducibility. However, thick surface oxide layers
reduce ZVAl's reactivity. Li et al. developed
mZVAl/MFe2O4 composites (M = Mn, Zn, Ni) using
a simple ball milling procedure, and they verified
their successful adsorption-reduction capability for
the removal of Cr (VI). The oxide coating was
removed, and the lattice spacing of mZVAl
increased due to ball milling with MFe2O4,
according to direct spectroscopic investigations and
density functional theory calculations. The
improvement in Cr (VI) removal was primarily due
to ZVAl's improved adsorption and reduction
capabilities following ball milling. To remove heavy
metals from wastewater, a new route for the
synthesis of reductive materials is presented in this
study.[230] The catalytic degradation of NPX in water
was carried out using a unique magnetically
recoverable CoFe2O4@MXene nanohybrid with a
multilayer structure and accordion-like morphology.
This hybrid was created by Fayyaz et al. using a
liquid self-assembly approach. Overall, it was
demonstrated that the CoFe2O4@MXene could
function as a nanohybrid catalyst for the NPX in an
aqueous media and other organic pollutants. It was
shown that the CoFe2O4@MXene could act as a
nanohybrid catalyst for the NPX in an aqueous
environment to be degraded.[231] Magnetic
adsorbents are produced using a simple
hydrothermal procedure including CoFe2O4 and GO.
CoFe2O4/GO composites are utilised to extract MB,
RhB, and MO. This study provides a thorough
insight into the mechanism of adsorption in
CoFe2O4/GO composites. It proposes a novel design
strategy for employing GO-based composites as
magnetic adsorbents to remove wastewater
pigments.[217] Mandal, et al. used soft chemical
methods to create zinc ferrite magnetic NPs. In the
presence of trace amounts of H2O2, the zinc ferrite
spinel, in its natural and calcined forms, exhibited
excellent photocatalytic activity to break down the
azo dye Acid Blue 113. After several operation
cycles, the catalyst maintained its initial action,
demonstrating a natural photocatalytic reaction. The
antibacterial activity of zinc ferrite NPs was shown
to be effective against both gram-positive and gramnegative bacterial strains.[120] CoFe2O4 NPs were
synthesized by the coprecipitation technique. They
were used to initiate the oxidizing agent PMS in the
breakdown of the antibiotic ampicillin. The analysis
revealed that the NPs have a cubic spinel structure
and a crystallite size of 10.10 nm. The study
investigated the impact of several parameters of
operation, including pH, PMS concentration,
presence or absence of catalyst, and length of time,

on the degradation of ampicillin. Under conditions
of neutral pH, 90.1% of the ampicillin completed
degradation over a 25-minute duration when
exposed to a catalyst concentration of 0.1 g/L and a
PMS concentration of 0.2 mM.[232] The study
involved the fabrication of heterogeneous Fenton
catalysts using a new core-shell modified
NiFe2O4@SiO2 magnetic catalyst. The study looked
at how dispersants, precipitants, and hydrothermal
temperatures affected the structure, surface
morphology, magnetism, and catalytic activity of
magnetic nanoparticle catalysts before and after
coating with SiO2. The catalytic activity of the
materials was assessed utilising the RhB degradation
detection analysis.[233] ZnO and ZnFe2O4 were
synthesised by Latif, et al. using a co-precipitation
procedure, and they were then evaluated using
various analytical methods. In contrast to ZnO,
which destroyed only 48.9% of the drug in the
photocatalytic study against diclofenac sodium,
ZnFe2O4 had a greater degradation efficiency of
61.4% in just 120 mins. Additionally, zinc ferrite
demonstrated good recyclability and remained
stable after five photodegradation cycles with only a
slight (3.9% loss) in photocatalytic activity.
According to a study of two catalysts, ZnFe2O4 has
a promising role in wastewater cleanup to get rid of
dangerous pharmaceuticals.[234] Ntiamoah, et al.
successfully showed, for the first time, that the
synthesis of 1-D ZnO-ZnFe2O4 nanofiber at its
original position leads to a strong contact at the
interface and a well-suited heterojunction for the
chemisorption of CR. As a result, 1-D ZnO-ZnFe2O4
has the highest recorded adsorption capacity for
ZnFe2O4-based
adsorbent,
at
263
mg/g.
Additionally, even after multiple uses, the used
adsorbent is easily regenerable and retains 75% of
its adsorption capability. The recent findings offer a
method for creating inexpensive but efficient ZnOZnFe2O4-based adsorbents to eliminate harmful
dyes. [235] Al-Najar et al. have described a simple yet
highly efficient thermal annealing method for
controlling defects related to oxygen vacancies in
ZnFe2O4 NPs. This method enhances the efficacy of
the NPs in wastewater treatment. The photocatalytic
performances of each sample were evaluated, and
the ZnFe2O4 samples subjected to annealing at
500°C exhibited the highest photocatalytic
efficiencies. Under conditions of high salinity, this
particular sample's organic dye breakdown
efficiency remained the highest. ZnFe2O4 samples
possess remarkable dye degradation capabilities as a
result of the high concentration of oxygen vacancies
within their crystal lattice. This leads to a significant
reduction in the recombination rate during the
photocatalytic process.[236] In their study, Shah et al.

utilised the co-precipitation method to generate
NiFe2O4 while also creating composites of NiFe2O4
and TiO2 with varying concentrations of TiO2. The
primary benefit of these composites lies in their
enhanced ability to absorb visible light and
effectively separate electron-hole pairs, which is
attributed to the various energy band positions in
NiFe2O4 and TiO2. The findings of our study
indicate that NCs based on NiFe2O4 can serve as a
highly efficient photocatalyst that can be easily
recovered using magnetic attraction.[237]

Applications

6.1. Dye degradation using spinel ferrites:
MnFe2O4/rGO (MrGO) was created by Adel M et al.
to remove a variety of cationic dyes efficiently. MG
and MB dye have strong adsorption capacities for
removal in the produced NCs, reaching 156 and 105
mg/g at 30°C, respectively. Electrostatic contact, ππ interaction, and the produced adsorbent's high
surface area of 95 m2/g made removing dyes from
MnFe2O4/rGO easier. After being reused for five
consecutive cycles, the as-synthesized adsorbent
exhibited good stability.[238] The self-combustion
method was used by Andrei et al. to create the
magnesium ferrite adsorbents, which were then
tested for MB adsorption. The effects of dye,
adsorbent concentrations, and pH were established
on the kinetic adsorption and magnesium ferrite
performance. As a result, during the MB adsorptiondesorption process, the produced adsorbents showed
structure stability and reusability. The characteristics
of the magnesium ferrite. It is suited for practical
application due to its high adsorption capacity,
regeneration abilities, and structural stability.[239]
Wang et al. researched to examine how well various
hydrothermally synthesized MFe2O4 (M = Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni) ferrite nanocrystals can adsorb CR from
wastewater. The MFe2O4 NPs exhibited significant
ferromagnetic characteristics when subjected to a
magnetic field, allowing them to be efficiently
separated using magnetic methods. Acetone was
discovered to be a proficient desorption agent for
MFe2O4 NPs that were loaded with CR. Among the
spinel ferrite nanocrystals, the CoFe2O4 nanocrystals
showed exceptional CR adsorption ability and a
greater saturation magnetisation of 86.1 emu g-1.[240]
A study by Jadhav et al. evaluated the physical,
chemical, magnetic, and photocatalytic properties of
Ni-Zn nanoferrites using the auto-combustion solgel method. The photocatalytic activity of RhB was
assessed under sunlight irradiation, showing an
increase in degradation efficiency up to 98% with an

increase in Ni2+ concentration.[241] Imran Hasan,
along with colleagues, looked into the
environmentally friendly production of NiFe2O4
(NIFE) spinel MNPs using chemical coprecipitation
of a Ni2+/Fe3+ solution in the presence of a
biopolymer combination of chitosan (CT) and
ascorbic acid (AS). In the presence of visible light
and ultrasonic vibrations, the material was also
studied as a potential photocatalyst for MG
photocatalytic degradation. Unlike adsorption,
photodegradation using sonochemistry produces
99% MG mineralisation without changing the
material's
structure.[242]
Semi-conductive
photocatalysts for water treatment are popular due to
their effectiveness and affordability. Muhammad
Rashid and his team developed nanostructured Mndoped cobalt ferrite. The material is a photocatalyst
with excellent electrical conductivity, magnetic
recyclability, and visible light activity. The
photocatalyst efficiently eliminated CV dye, which
is driven by visible light, from water and retained
97.2% of its original photocatalytic activity even
after four consecutive cycles. This study
demonstrates the potential of combining the surface
characteristics of a semi-conductive catalyst with its
magnetically charged, mechanical, and optical
features to efficiently and economically clean
wastewater.[243] Zulhumar Musajan et al. created
nano-CoFe2O4@MC, a catalyst to degrade CR in
wastewater treatment. It addresses issues of low
activation performance, secondary pollution, and
challenging recovery of nanometal catalysts. The
catalyst's efficient degradation of CR was through
both radical and nonradical routes. The catalyst
exhibits exceptional catalytic efficiency, stability,
reusability, and very little release of ions, making it
highly suitable for the remediation of antimicrobial
wastewater.[244] Researchers explored using
spherical (28 nm) nickel ferrite crystals to remove
crystal violet dye from water. Detailed analysis
suggests the crystals physically attract the dye,
forming multiple layers on their surface, rather than
creating a chemical bond. This method achieved a
high capacity (19.6 mg/g of dye removed per gram
of crystals) but with a moderate rate of adsorption.
Further investigation revealed the process aligns
with a scientific model describing physical
adsorption on surfaces.[245] Ramadevi et al.
synthesised NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 doped with
aluminium using hydrothermal synthesis. The NPs
were characterised by different techniques. The
material demonstrated strong photocatalytic
performance in degrading MB and MO dyes when
irradiated with visible light.[246]

Naik, M. et al. used Tamarindus indica seeds to
create magnetic NiFe2O4 NPs (NFNPs) through a
microwave-assisted technique with a green reducing
agent. The NFNPs were identified through various
techniques. The NFNPs exhibited a spinel structure
that was proven to be single-phase using XRD
analysis. The average size of the crystallites was
determined to be 21 nm. The FTIR analysis
determined the specific positions of the NFNPs, both
in tetrahedral and octahedral arrangements. The
NFNPs possess a noticeable band gap of 1.92 eV.
Under visible light irradiation, NFNPs exhibit strong
photocatalytic activity for the adsorption of cationic
MB and anionic Alizarin Red S dyes. VSM
investigations demonstrate that NFNPs exhibit good
magnetic properties. NFNPs can be used for
wastewater treatment.[247] Microwave combustion
was used to synthesize Copper-doped NiFe2O4
spinel NPs. The X-ray diffraction patterns revealed
that the introduction of Cu resulted in the emergence
of the secondary -Fe2O3 phase, alongside the preexisting cubic structure. The Cu-doped NiFe2O4
spinel NPs, in their original state, demonstrated
exceptional photocatalytic destruction of RhB when
exposed to visible light. The photocatalytic

performance of bulk NiFe2O4 was greatly improved
by Cu-doping. The highest photocatalytic activity
was achieved when the ratio of Cu-doping reached x
= 0.4, up to an ideal value.[248]
6.2. Pharma waste removal using spinel ferrites:
Co-precipitation was used by Latif et al. to create the
ZnO and ZnFe2O4 NPs. The breakdown of
diclofenac sodium during 120 minutes of UV light
irradiation was shown to be more successfully
catalyzed by synthetic ZnFe2O4 (61.4%) than by
ZnO (48.9%) without the need for an oxidizing
agent. Furthermore, zinc ferrite exhibited excellent
recyclability even after undergoing five distinct
photocatalytic activity tests, indicating a promising
level of catalyst stability.[234] Tetracycline
hydrochloride (TCH) is degraded 90% and 86% of
the time by strong MW synthesized adsorbers, the
highly crystalline spinel NiFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4,
which are formed by coprecipitation. The catalyst is
reusable, as shown by the fact that the whole
reaction is completed in less than 15 minutes.[249]
Researchers employed a microwave-assisted
process with K2CO3 chemical activation under
optimized conditions to produce activated carbon

from lentil waste (LW). The LWAC was later used
as a matrix for the production of spinel ferrite
composites due to its significant surface area of 1875
m2/g. The combination of CuFe2O4 NPs with LWAC
resulted in the creation of a new magnetic composite
material called M-LWAC. The wastewater
containing Tetracycline (TC) was efficiently
eliminated using M-LWAC, which had an
adsorption capacity of 384.62 mg/g.[250] A study
investigated spinel ferrite NPs (MFe2O4, where M
represents iron, cobalt, nickel, or zinc) as potential
carriers for the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX)
and methotrexate (MTX). Among the different
MFe2O4 NPs tested, cobalt ferrite (CFO) emerged
as the most promising candidate for targeted cancer
therapy due to its superior magnetic properties,
colloidal stability, cytotoxicity towards cancer cells,
and biocompatibility.[251] Sol-gel auto-combustion
was used by Jasrotia et al. to create nickel-modified
Co single bond Mg magnetic nano photocatalysts
with the following chemical formula: Co0.65Mg0.35xNixFe2O4. The produced NPs were employed to
photodegrade the pharmaceutical effluent from
amoxicillin using sunlight.[252] Xiao S. et al. used
sonochemical
methods
to
synthesize

SnFe2O4/BiFeO3 NCs, which were then employed as
photocatalysts. NCs consisting of SnFe2O4/BiFeO3
exhibit superior photocatalytic activity compared to
individual SnFe2O4 or BiFeO3 NPs. The.OH radical
had a predominant role in the photocatalytic
degradation method. The SnFe2O4-BiFeO3 NCs
completely eradicated the malachite green dye under
visible light exposure, achieving 100% degradation
over 60 mins. The anticancer medicine doxorubicin
was put into NCs consisting of SnFe2O4 and BiFeO3.
The survival capacity of human liver cancer cells
was assessed by subjecting them to doxorubicin,
SnFe2O4, BiFeO3, and folic acid. The potential
features of SnFe2O4/BiFeO3 NCs are proven in their
applications
for
ecological
remediation,
antibacterial activities, and drug delivery.[253]
Researchers
developed
a
photocatalyst,
ZrFe2O4@ZIF-8, by combining ZrFe2O4 with
zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). This
novel material proved highly effective in eliminating
dopamine (DOP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)
from water. Notably, ZrFe2O4@ZIF-8 achieved
complete degradation (100%) of both DOP and
SMX, surpassing the performance of ZrFe2O4
alone.[254]

Researchers developed a method to create an NC
material combining spinel ferrite with g-C3N4 for
eliminating antibiotic pollutants from wastewater.
This synthesis involved a four-step process:
pyrolysis, solution combustion, mechanical
grinding, and annealing. The created photocatalyst
was evaluated for its capacity to decompose the drug
Doxycycline in sunlight. Based on the results, the
experiment resulted in a maximum degradation
efficiency of 97.10% for the pollutant in a created
heterojunction. The experiment lasted for 60
mins.[218] Promazine was eliminated from
wastewater using a magnetic nano adsorbent
composed of AC that was modified with CoFe2O4
NPs, a kind of metal ferrite (AC-CoFe2O4). AlHetlani et al. exhibited remarkable stability, showed
efficacy in eliminating both acidic and alkaline
pharmaceuticals from wastewater, and could be
regenerated and reused by the application of a
magnetic field.[255] The sol-gel auto-combustion
method was utilised by Jadhav et al.to generate the
NPs of ZnxNi1-xFe2O4, which were also employed to
eliminate RhB from the industrial wastewater.
Under 180 mins of exposure to sunshine, the
produced NPs' photocatalytic activity showed
maximal degradation rates of 90%, 94%, and 98%,
respectively.[256] Behura, R. et al. effectively
synthesized CoFe2O4 NPs by using iron recovered
from waste iron ore tailings and cobalt recovered
from wasted lithium-ion batteries. Subsequently,
they were characterized and used for photo/sonocatalytic degradation of CR.[257] Kaur, P. et al.
developed a novel hexagonal ferrite-based coreshell-shell nanostructure, namely SrFe@Dop@M,
for the combined electrochemical detection and
photocatalytic degradation of medical drugs. M
represents the elements Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and
Zn. The degradation of levofloxacin and SMX was
assessed using a comparative photocatalytic
assessment
of
SrFe,
SrFe@Dop,
and
SrFe@Dop@M.[258] Dhiman et al. observed the
synthesis of Mg-substituted Zn nano-ferrite (Zn1xMgxFe2O4) with varying levels of Mg. The purpose
of this synthesis was to investigate its effectiveness
in degrading sulfadiazine. The objective of the
project is to create cost-effective photocatalysts that
are solar-active and tunable, to efficiently degrade
and mineralize pharmaceutical pollutants using
photochemical processes.[259] Makofane, A. et al.
used an extract derived from the Monsonia burkeana
plant to synthesize ZnFe2O4 NPs. The optimal
conditions for achieving a 99.8% elimination of MB
were a pH of 12, a reaction time of 45 minutes, and
a catalyst dose of 25 mg. The ability of the ZnFe2O4

NPs to be easily separated and recycled, as well as
their continued effectiveness even after five reuses,
demonstrate the material's great stability. The ROS
tests also showed that the key elements causing MB
to deteriorate are electrons. Sulfisoxazole in water
degraded by 67% when the photocatalytic efficiency
of the sulfonamide antibiotic was tested. This study
has demonstrated that these materials can be utilised
to target water contaminated by textiles and
drugs.[260] CoFe2O4 NPs that were synthesized by
Balakrishnan, et al. were produced using the
Coprecipitation method. Analyses were conducted
on the degradation of ampicillin caused by the
cooperative action of CoFe2O4 and PMS NPs. The
estimated optimisation of the impacting parameters
during deterioration.[232]
6.3. Spinel ferrites anti-bacterial and antimicrobial studies
A new NC adsorbent, ALW/CoFe2O4, was made by
combining Apocynaceae leaf waste-AC (ALW)
with CoFe2O4 using an auto-combustion technique.
This adsorbent was developed to eliminate Reactive
Red 141 dye and bacteria, namely S. aureus, E. coli,
and C. albicans.[206] The hydrothermal method at
180°C for 15, 20, and 25 hours was effectively used
by Sarang R et al. to prepare the spinel ferrite NPs
(SFNPs) of Mg0.2Zn0.5Mn0.3Fe2O4. Through the use
of Zone of Influence (ZOI), the antibacterial
effectiveness of SFNPs against several harmful
bacteria was demonstrated.[261] Kumari et al.
described the production of Ca-doped Mg-Zn ferrite
Mg0.4Zn(0.6-x)CaxFe2O4 nanomaterials using a citrate
precursor method, and they conducted a thorough
analysis of their structural, morphological, optical,
photocatalytic, and antibacterial properties. The
RhB dye solution was degraded by photocatalysis
under UV light. On the fungus Candida albicans,
every one of the produced nano ferrites showed a
promising antibacterial activity. RhB dye may be
degraded by Mg0.4Zn0.1Ca0.5Fe2O4 NPs more
effectively (99.5%) and they exhibit greater
antibacterial activity (96.1%) when it comes to
inhibiting the Candida albicans fungus.[262] Silvermagnetite NPs were combined by El-Bassuony et al.
with several magnetic materials, including spinel
copper and cobalt nanoferrites, to create NC that was
made easily, cheaply, and quickly using autocombustion. Finally, against the evaluated Grampositive and Gram-negative species, both samples
demonstrated excellent antibacterial effectiveness.
As a result, their prospective use as antibacterial NPs
in biomedical applications is suggested.[263] The

structural characteristics of combustion-produced
nanocrystalline spinel ferrites have the chemical
formula Mg0.8xCdxFe2O4 (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6).
Using the produced nanocatalysts, the photocatalytic
reduction of MB and CR was also studied by Bessy,
T. C., et al. When compared to MB, CR deteriorated
more successfully. According to antibacterial test
results, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
aureus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus flavus
were all susceptible. To all chosen pathogens, all
ferrite NPs displayed antibacterial activity. The most
effective of these had a zone of inhibition of 32 mm
against P. aeruginosa and was Cd0.2Mg0.6Fe2O4.[264]
The citrate gel method is used by Mordekar, Rajashri
Karmali et al. to create the silver-substituted cobalt
zinc ferrite series, CoxAg0.5-xZn0.5Fe2O4, with ferrite
formation occurring at 600 °C. As silver
concentration rises, antimicrobial activity increases
before
further
declining.
The
material
Co0.4Ag0.1Zn0.5Fe2O4 demonstrates magnetic and
antibacterial properties. The creation of removable
antimicrobial agents for water filtration and
medicine delivery systems may benefit from using
these materials.[265] Dhanda et al. used the autocombustion method, using aloe vera extract as a fuel,
to produce nickel-doped cobalt nano ferrites
(NixCo1-xFe2O4, where x ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 with
an increment of 0.2). In addition, the antibacterial
capabilities of ferrite NPs were evaluated on the C.
albicans fungus, and it was discovered that nickeldoped
cobalt
ferrite
exhibits
inhibitory
characteristics. The component x = 1.0 had a
maximum inhibition of 0.43, corresponding to a
67% reduction in growth. Consequently, these
ferrite NPs may be used to treat fungal
infections.[266] The sol-gel process was used by
Nigam et al. to create the Fe3O4 NPs. The
antibacterial experiment against E. coli and S.aureus
bacteria showed a sizable zone of inhibition.[267] ElKhawaga et al. used co-precipitation to synthesize
CoFe2O4 NPs, which were then subjected to surface
modification using Capsaicin derived from
Capsicum annuum ssp. The antibacterial potential
and photocatalytic degradation efficacy of the

generated compounds were evaluated using
Fuchsine basic. This study investigated the
effectiveness of a substance against two types of
bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive)
and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative). The disk
diffusion and broth dilution methods were employed
to assess the extent of bacterial growth inhibition
(zones of inhibition) and the minimum concentration
required to completely suppress bacterial growth.
The synthesised CPCF NPs showed substantial
antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, they
exhibited exceptional efficacy in removing FB,
making them promising for applications in both
medicinal and biological environments.[268]
Wendari, et al. used a hydrothermal technique to
produce
CuFe2O4/hydroxyapatite
magnetic
composites. The capping agent employed was betel
leaf extract, while Pensi clam shells were used as the
source of calcium. The degradation rate of Direct
Red 81 was 99.8% after a 2-hour exposure. The
combination exhibited antimicrobial activity against
both S. aureus and E. coli, resulting in an inhibition
zone of 11.9 mm.[269] Blessy and their colleagues
documented the synthesis of a range of ferrofluids
composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) with chromium (Cr)
substitution. The amounts of chromium varied from
x = 0 to 0.8. The synthesis employs a cost-effective
and simple co-precipitation method that stabilizes
the product using tetramethylammonium hydroxide
(TMOAH). This study focuses on the effectiveness
of chromium-substituted ferrofluids in killing
Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus
bacteria.[270] The coprecipitation approach was used
by Hatami Kahkesh et al. to synthesize CuFe2O4 and
ZnFe2O4 NPs. A study of their antioxidant and
antibacterial characteristics was conducted. The
CuFe2O4 NPs have an antioxidant activity of 71%,
whereas the ZnFe2O4 NPs show an antioxidant
activity of 80%. Moreover, the study demonstrated
that CuFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 NPs had a potent
antibacterial impact on Escherichia coli and
Staphylococcus aureus.[271]

Auto-combustion process

The citrate gel auto-combustion method was used by
Goud et al. to create MgxCd1-xFe2O4 (MgCdFO). MgCd nano ferrites exhibit a significant antibacterial
activity against both Gram-positive and -negative
Klebsiella pneumonia. As a result, the MgCdFO nano
ferrite particles might be thought of as potential
candidates for use as antimicrobials in the field of
medicine due to their substantial growth inhibition
against bacteria.[272] Shokri et al. used the coprecipitation process to fabricate an innovative
nanomagnet modified with NiFe2O4 NPs and coated
with hybrid chitosan (CS-NiFe2O4). The antibacterial
activities of CS-NiFe2O4 NPs were more effective than
NiFe2O4 NPs and CS. The CS-NiFe2O4 NPs exhibited
minimum inhibitory concentrations of 128 and 256
mg/mL against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively.[273]
Reddy et al. synthesised samples of CoFe2O4 nano
powder doped with gadolinium (Gd) using an easy
auto-combustion procedure. The combustion agent
used in this process was citric acid. The samples were
then subjected to structural, magnetic, and
antimicrobial analyses. Both pure CoFe2O4 and
CoFe2O4 replaced with Gd have antibacterial action
against many diseases, including the fungal strain
Aspergillus niger, as well as the Gram-positive bacteria
Bacillus subtilis and the Gram-negative bacteria
Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These
findings indicate that the replacement of Gd greatly
enhances the activity of cobalt ferrite nanopowders.

6.4. Photocatalytic performance enhancement:
The photocatalyst produces electron and hole pairs via
the absorption of energy from photons. However, in its
pristine form, the catalyst exhibits a substantial rate of
electron-hole recombination, resulting in a restricted
photocatalytic efficiency. The improved photocatalytic

[267]
[268]

[271]
[272]

[274]

activity observed in CuO/ZnFe2O4 NCs can be
attributed to a synergistic effect that enhances the
separation of photo-generated carriers. This effect is
facilitated by the internal electric field, which promotes
effective charge separation by facilitating the
interaction between electrons in the conduction band of
CuO and holes concentrated in the valence band of
ZnFe2O4. The decrease in recombination rate prolongs
the lifetime of charge carriers. In addition, in proximity
to the conduction band edge of ZnFe2O4, oxygen that
is dissolved in a solution utilizes available electrons to
initiate oxidation reactions, leading to the generation of
a significant quantity of superoxide radicals.
Additionally, hydroxyl ions and water molecules trap
vacancies in the valence band of CuO, leading to the
production of hydroxyl radicals via oxidation
reactions. The primary reactive species, O2•−, together
with additional species, OH• and h+, collectively
facilitate the effective degradation of the target
pollutant,
CR,
into
smaller
intermediate
compounds.[275] The D-CNFO@G photocatalyst
produces free electrons and holes via an electron
transition process upon exposure to light. Superoxide
O2•- and hydrogen oxide HO• radicals form because of
the interaction between electrons, holes, oxygen
molecules, and water on the surface of graphene.[276]
RhB may be destroyed via two main mechanisms:
direct oxidation by photogenerated holes or by
interaction with superoxide or hydroxyl radicals
generated by photocatalysts.[277] Azo dyes have
aromatic rings that possess an azo bond, which serves
as a chromophore. The number of azo bonds may range
from one to many. Their aromatic structure provided
stability against light and oxidation to these pigments.
However, Anthraquinone dyes persist in the effluent
for an extended period because they are more resistant
to degradation owing to their fused aromatic structure.
In addition, the anthraquinone structure has two
carbonyl groups, which act as electron acceptors. The

degradation of these dyes takes place via the
acceptance of electron donors.[278] When light interacts
with
the
surface
of
the
photocatalyst
Mg0.6Zn0.2Co0.2Fe2O4, charges are produced. MXene
sheets function as acceptors by effectively capturing
electrons and enhancing the separation of charge
carriers. Electrons reduce adsorbed oxygen (O2) to
make superoxide radicals (O2•-), whereas holes oxidize
water molecules to produce hydroxyl radical ions
(OH●‒). These species engage with the contaminants
and decompose them in the catalytic solution, resulting
in the production of not harmful degradation
byproducts such as water and carbon dioxide.[279]
When the dye solution containing the resultant
catalysts is exposed to UV irradiation, electron transfer
occurs. Electrons (e−) move from the valence band of
NZF and CO to the conduction band of NZF and CO,
respectively. This transfer results in the generation of
positively charged holes (h+). The degradation of the
dye is attributed to the generation of electrons (e-) and
holes (h+) induced by light. Electrons engage in a
reaction with oxygen (O2) to generate superoxide
radicals (O2•-) at a potential of -0.046 electron volts
(compared to the conventional hydrogen electrode,
NHE). On the other hand, the holes react with water
(H2O) to make hydroxyl radicals (•OH) at a potential of
2.4 electron volts (compared to NHE). The radicals
induce the decomposition of the organic pigment into
water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The probability
of superoxide radicals being formed is lower than the
conduction band of NZF and CO, whereas the
likelihood of hydroxyl radicals being generated is
greater than the valence band of CO. The lack of
reactivity between the valence band of NZF and H2O,
resulting in the absence of hydroxyl radicals, may be
ascribed to the high position of the valence band in
NZF. Therefore, both categories of radicals may
coexist to participate in the photocatalytic process, and
the Z-scheme heterojunction system can enhance the
interaction between NZF and CO in the presence of UV
light. Furthermore, the exceptional ability of MWCNT
to transmit charges expeditiously enhances charge
transfer and inhibits the recombination of excitons.[280]
Barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19) has a conduction band
and valence band between TiO2. TiO2's conduction
band is greater than barium hexaferrite's and Pt and
Pd's Fermi energy levels. Therefore, two techniques are
beneficial: Noble metals and barium hexaferrite
promote separation as adsorbents. Light energizes
TiO2's valence band VB electrons, which move to the
conduction band. Photoexcited electrons travel toward
noble metals on titanium oxide and BaFe12O19's
conduction band after electron-hole pairs are created.
Additionally, the holes created approach the barium
hexaferrite valence band. (ii) Noble metals absorb
visible light and donate electrons to TiO2 via surface
plasmon resonance (SPR). Electrons in the electric
current rise. TiO2 and BaFe12O19 may exchange
photoexcited electrons. These reactions may separate
electrons and holes, causing dyes to degrade by

interacting with water and oxygen to create O2• and
hydroxyl radicals.[281] Using the CoFe2O4@UiO-66
photocatalyst and the results and talk previously
already had, researchers, have come up with a good
reaction route for breaking down MB and MO directly
through light. When excited by simulated direct
sunshine, UiO-66 and CoFe2O4 create electrons (e–)
and holes (h+) in their conduction band and valence
band. The excited electrons may easily flow across the
heterojunction interface channels to reach the LUMO
of UiO-66 because CoFe2O4 has a higher negative CB
potential (-0.56 V) than the LUMO (-0.44 V). This
approach effectively blocks photogenerated carrier
recombination. The electrons generated by
photoinduction at the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) of UiO-66 may combine with
dissolved oxygen, forming •O2− radicals. Light-created
gaps would move from UiO-66's valence band (VB)
(+3.40 V) to CoFe2O4's (+1.07 V). Photogenerated
holes cannot oxidize H2O and form •OH radicals
because CoFe2O4 has a lower VB potential (+1.07 V)
than –OH/•OH (1.99 V versus NHE). However, dye
molecules deteriorate fast due to their tremendous
oxidation capabilities as holes increase. Alternatively,
superoxide (•O2−) radicals may indirectly form
hydroxyl (•OH) reactive radicals at the photocatalyst's
conduction band.[282]
6.5. Heavy metals removal using spinel ferrites:
The objective of this work was to synthesise MnFe2O4
and CoFe2O4 spinel ferrite NPs using a co-precipitation
method, to examine their effectiveness in removing
zinc from water solutions. The thermodynamics
investigations demonstrated that the adsorption of zinc
(II) was both exothermic and spontaneous.
Additionally, Asadi, Reza, et al. also examined the
ability of the adsorbents to be reused and their capacity
to release the adsorbed substances.[283] Lingamdinne et
al. prepared a nanoscale hybrid material composed of
GO and inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (GONF).
Subsequently, this substance is used to extract toxic
metals from aqueous solutions. The batch adsorption
processes successfully used GONF for the elimination
of Pb (II) and Cr (III). Hence, the process of Pb (II) and
Cr (III) being attracted to GONF occurred by
chemisorption, forming a single layer on the even
surface of GONF. The adsorption of metal ions showed
a direct relationship with temperature, suggesting that
it is a chemisorption process that involves the
formation of surface complexes in the inner layer. The
results clearly show that GONF is a very efficient
sorbent for the removal of Pb(II) and Cr(III) from
wastewater.[284] Jung et al. showed the easy production
of cubic spinel-type MnFe2O4 /biochar composites
using a simple hydrothermal process. The biochar was
coated with MnFe2O4 spinel NPs, resulting in magnetic
separability due to superparamagnetic behaviour.
Additionally, the treated biochar exhibited efficient
adsorption capability for heavy metals such as Pb (II),

Cu (II), and Cd (II).[285] Sezgin et al. assess the
effectiveness of CuFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 NPs in the
removal of zinc, nickel, and copper heavy metals from
synthetic wastewater. NPs of CuFe2O4 and NiFe2O4
were synthesized using the PEG-assisted hydrothermal
method. Subsequently, the NPs (CuFe2O4 and
NiFe2O4) were used to determine the extent to which
they can effectively remove heavy metals and their
capacity to adsorb these metals.[286] The synthesis of
NiFe2O4 NPs (NFNs) was carried out by the coprecipitation technique from a research group.
Subsequently, these NPs were used as an adsorbent to
eliminate Cr(VI), Pb(II), and Cd(II) from
wastewater.[287] ZnFe2O4-Alginate beads, referred to as
ZFN-Alg beads, were created by Kumar et al. The
results indicate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of
using magnetic biopolymer beads for the removal of
Pb(II) and Cu(II) metal ions from both single and
combined systems.[173] Ramadan et al. utilized the flash
auto-combustion approach was used to synthesise
different compositions of CuFe2O4, Zn-CuFe2O4, and
Co-CuFe2O4. The samples that were created were
tested to evaluate their effectiveness in eliminating the
heavy metal Cr6+ from water. Optimal outcomes were
achieved by adjusting the experimental parameters,
namely by maintaining a pH level of 7 and allowing a
contact period of 50 minutes. The CuFe2O4, ZnCuFe2O4, and Co-CuFe2O4 NCs exhibited removal
efficiencies of 54%, 90%, and 93% accordingly.[288]
Camacho et al. produced zinc-copper ferrites (Zn1–
xCuxFe2O4) by the simple hydrothermal technique.
After 24 hours, Z2C7 exhibited a relatively low
efficacy in reducing Cr6+ compared to Pb2+ and Ni2+.
After 24 hours, Z2C7, Z5C5, and Z7C2 demonstrated
a 100% efficacy in eliminating Ni2+ and Pb2+, at a
dosage of 0.5 g.[289] Lingamdinne et.al., synthesized
biogenic MISFNPs from Cnidiummonnieri (L.) Cuss
(CLC) seed extract. MISFNPs were utilized in batch
tests to remove Pb (II) and Cr (III) from aqueous
solutions and also showed that NPs adsorb Pb (II) and
Cr (III) endothermically. Finally, green-synthesised
MISFNPs can recycle and remove heavy metals
without losing stability.[290] The process of microwave
combustion was used by Al Yaqoob et al. to synthesize
NPs of spinel ferrite MFe2O4. Metal nitrates were
utilized as precursors, while urea served as the fuel.
The MNPs, in their original state, exhibit enhanced
efficacy in adsorbing Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions, with a
maximum adsorption capacity of 69.4 mg/g and 47.1
mg/g, respectively. Remarkably, the presence of metal
M influences selectivity: CoFe2O4 exhibits a
preference for Cd2+ ions, while ZnFe2O4 exhibits a
preference for Pb2+ ions.[291] A one-step solvothermal
approach was used by Guo et al. to produce novel
magnetic composites consisting of amino-modified
rice bran biochar and MgFeAlO4 (RB@MgFeAlO4NH2). These composites were specifically designed to
efficiently eliminate toxic Ni (II) from wastewater. The
study investigated the removal and sorption of Ni (II)
on RB@MgFeAlO4-NH2 using a combination of batch

experiments
and
spectrum
approaches.
RB@MgFeAlO4-NH2 is a very efficient adsorbent for
extracting Ni (II) from aqueous solutions due to its ecofriendliness, low cost, ease of magnetic separation, and
high sorption capacity.[204] Narayana et al. prepared NC
consisting of rGO-based inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (rGOSNF) created to remove Pb (II). Lead (II) is a toxic
heavy metal that is a significant pollutant in water
pollution.[292] Tatarchuk et al. conducted a study to
explore the capabilities of magnesium-zinc ferrites,
namely Mg1-xZnxFe2O4, as magnetic sorbents for
environmental purposes. The research found that the
adsorption processes of Cr (VI) and Ni (II) ions are
mostly chemical. The produced magnesium-zinc
ferrites have shown significant promise as magnetic
adsorbents for the environmental removal of chromate
and nickel ions..[293] The compound Cu0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4
was produced by a co-precipitation technique from
Tran et al. and then subjected to calcination at a
temperature of 900°C. The compound was then studied
for its ability to adsorb Pb (II). The findings obtained
have verified that the Cu0.5 Mg0.5Fe2O4 ternary oxides
have a significant ability to adsorb Pb (II) due to the
increased number of active adsorptive sites on the
ferrite.[294] Tavares et al. examined the use of spinel
ferrite particles (Fe3O4, MnFe2O4, and CoFe2O4) as
magnetic nanosorbents to remove arsenic from water
samples that were intentionally contaminated.
Furthermore, these magnetic nano sorbents also show
outstanding performance in sorbing As (V).[295] Iqbal et
al. investigated the production, examination, and
capacity to draw in molecules of spinel CoFe2O4 NPs
that have been modified with rGO. The adsorption
capabilities of the NC were assessed by examining its
capacity to adsorb cationic CV, brilliant green (BG),
anionic MO, and CR dyes. Hence, the NC exhibited
remarkable adsorption properties for the removal of
dyes and heavy metals.[296] Kumari et al. used the coprecipitation process to generate NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4
doped with alkaline earth metals to effectively remove
toxic components like Cd (II) and Pb (II). NiFe2O4 have
removal efficiencies of 45% and 83% for Cd and Pb
ions, respectively. Nevertheless, Pb (II) and Cd (II)
clearance percentages improve to 97% and 80%
respectively when NiFe2O4 are doped. The results
suggest that mesoporous ferrites, as determined
through BET analysis, demonstrate effective
adsorption capabilities for the removal of heavy metals
from wastewater. Furthermore, these ferrites exhibit a
high level of recyclability and can be easily separated
using an external magnetic field.[297]

Future research gaps:

Future research on spinel ferrites for dye degradation
must address several critical gaps to enhance their
efficiency and practical applicability. Achieving
accurate manipulation of the size, shape, and surface
characteristics of spinel ferrites, while also
implementing scalable and cost-effective techniques,

remains a top priority in their synthesis. Enhancing
surface area and porosity to improve interaction with
dye molecules, and investigating the effects of doping
and cation substitution to tailor catalytic properties, are
crucial for optimization. Assessing the long-term
stability and performance under various environmental
conditions, and developing methods for regeneration
and reuse without significant loss of catalytic activity,
are vital for practical applications. Exploring the
integration of spinel ferrites with other materials and
technologies, such as photocatalysts and advanced
oxidation processes, can enhance overall degradation
efficiency. Identifying and characterizing by-products
to ensure they are not harmful, and conducting
comprehensive toxicity studies to assess the
environmental impact of both the spinel ferrites and the
degradation by-products, are also important. Pilotscale studies to evaluate performance in real
wastewater treatment scenarios, considering the
presence of multiple contaminants, are necessary to
bridge the gap between laboratory research and
practical applications. Additionally, a cost-benefit
analysis comparing spinel ferrites with existing dye
degradation technologies will help assess their
practical viability. Addressing these gaps will
significantly enhance the understanding and
effectiveness of spinel ferrites in dye degradation,
leading to more efficient, sustainable, and
economically viable solutions for treating dyecontaminated wastewater and contributing to
environmental protection and public health.
The world's dye-based industries are now encountering
significant obstacles, including intense rivalry, excess
production capacity, declining profit margins, and
heightened environmental concerns. This has led to a
widespread reluctance to provide funds for overhead
costs, such as research and development and
wastewater treatment. Therefore, finding a costeffective solution to remove colour and toxicity from
effluents is still a significant challenge. The complexity
of dye removal is further complicated by the wide
range of structural variations among dyes that may be
used in a single dyeing process, as well as by additional
components present in wastewater that might hinder
the treatment process.[298] The extensive use of
synthetic dyes in the dyeing of textiles is leading to
significant environmental contamination and damage
to aquatic ecosystems. These dyes are derived from
petrochemical sources and include possibly
carcinogenic and poisonous substances.[299] By
systematically addressing these research gaps, spinel
ferrites can be further developed as a key material in
environmental remediation technologies, ultimately
providing more robust and versatile solutions for
managing dye pollutants and contributing to
environmental protection and public health.

Conclusion

This review focuses on the use of spinel ferrites in the
treatment of wastewater contaminated with dyes. It
highlights the potential of spinel ferrites as a costeffective, efficient, and sustainable solution. Spinel
ferrites, which have the general formula AB2O4,
possess unique properties such as a high surface area,
porosity, magnetic characteristics, chemical stability,
and corrosion resistance. These properties make them
highly effective in adsorbing and degrading dye
pollutants. The catalytic properties of spinel ferrites
enable advanced oxidation processes, leading to the
efficient degradation of organic dyes. Moreover, the
magnetic nature of spinel ferrites allows for easy
separation from treated water, enabling their reuse and
reducing operational costs. Research has shown that
spinel ferrites can effectively remove a wide range of
dye contaminants from real wastewater, and their
ability to be regenerated ensures their long-term
applicability. Spinel ferrites are environmentally
friendly and scalable for industrial applications,
making them versatile in treating various sources of
dye-laden wastewater, including industrial effluents
and textile wastewater. Despite their promise, there are
challenges that need to be addressed, such as
developing
cost-effective
synthesis
methods,
optimizing operational parameters for real wastewater
conditions, and ensuring long-term stability and
performance in continuous systems. Combining spinel
ferrites with other technologies, such as membranes
and biochar, could further enhance treatment
efficiency. The integration of spinel ferrites into hybrid
systems and their ability to function under diverse
environmental conditions make them a promising
solution for future innovations in dye degradation.
The review also discusses different synthesis methods
for spinel ferrites, including sol-gel, coprecipitation,
hydrothermal,
microemulsion,
template,
sonochemical, electrochemical, flame spray pyrolysis,
and electrospinning. Each method has an impact on the
properties and performance of spinel ferrites in dye
degradation, with specific advantages in terms of cost,
scalability, and control over material characteristics.
Sol-gel and coprecipitation methods are known for
producing uniform and high-purity spinel ferrites,
while hydrothermal synthesis and solid-state reactions
offer simplicity and potential for large-scale
production. Microemulsion and template methods
provide precise control over particle size and
morphology, sonochemical and electrochemical
methods enable rapid synthesis, flame spray pyrolysis
allows for large-scale production, and electrospinning
creates fibrous structures with a high surface area.
Additionally, the review discusses the classification of
spinel ferrites based on the number and type of metal

incorporating noble metals. Mono-metallic spinel
ferrites contain a single type of metal ion, while bimetallic and tri-metallic variants include two or three
