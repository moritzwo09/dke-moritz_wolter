Abstract
Radical-radical reaction channels are important in the pyrolysis and oxidation
chemistry of perfluoroalkyl substances. In particular, unimolecular dissociation reactions
within unbranched n-perfluoroalkyl chains, and their corresponding reverse barrierless
association reactions, are expected to be significant contributors to the gas-phase
thermal decomposition of families of species such as perfluorinated carboxylic acids and
perfluorinated sulfonic acids. Unfortunately, experimental data for these reactions are
scarce and uncertain. Furthermore, obtaining reliable theoretical predictions for such
reactions is a laborious and computationally intensive task. In this work, we present
state-of-the-art ab initio transition-state-theory-based master-equation calculations
examining the chemical kinetics of the various association/decomposition reactions
producing/decomposing the C2 − C4 series of unbranched n-perfluoroalkanes (C2 F6 ,
C3 F8 , and C4 F10 ). The variable-reaction-coordinate transition-state theory (VRCTST) formalism is employed in computing the microcanonical and canonical rates
for the association reactions. Reaction thermochemistry is obtained via composite
quantum chemistry calculations and the laddering of error-cancelling reaction schemes
via a connectivity-based hierarchy approach employing ANL1/ANL0-style reference
energies. Lennard-Jones collision model parameters for the considered systems were
estimated by a direct dynamics approach, and collisional energy transfer parameters
were obtained from analogies to systems of similar size and heavy-atom connectivity.
A one-dimensional master equation approach was used to convert the microcanonical
rate coefficients from the VRC-TST analysis into temperature- and pressure-dependent
rate constants for the association reactions and the reverse dissociation reactions. The
data are reported in standardized formats for usage in comprehensive chemical kinetic
models for PFAS thermal destruction.

1. Introduction
The thermal destruction of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has garnered much attention
recently due to concerns of adverse health effects, environmental bioaccumulation, and long
half-lives. 1–5 Full mineralization of all C−F bonds into HF and CO2 is necessary for effective
removal of PFAS from contaminated matrices, but the combustion is often incomplete. The
difficulty in experimentally characterizing the products of incomplete combustion, which are
potentially hazardous, has prompted a variety of computational studies into the chemical
reaction mechanisms of PFAS pyrolysis and oxidation. 6–10
Extensive examinations of the thermochemistry of species involved in the destruction of
perfluorinated carboxylic acids and perfluorinated sulfonic acids indicate that radical-radical
reaction channels, such as homolytic dissociation within perfluoroalkyl chains, are likely
important alongside molecular or pericyclic reactions with sufficiently low electronic barriers
to contribute at incineration conditions. However, in the existing theoretical studies on
PFAS thermal decomposition, the consideration of barrierless reactions has been limited.
An example is the variational transition-state theory treatment of reactions like fluorine
atom loss or singlet-CF2 dissociation from n-perfluoroalkyl radicals or the dissociation of
the carbon-sulfur bond in perfluorinated sulfonic acids, using bond-stretching coordinates
and single-reference density functional methods by Altarawneh and co-workers. 7,8 While
these reactions may be relevant to PFAS thermal decomposition, the series of carbon-carbon
bond scissions (and their reverse associations) within perfluoroalkyl chains indicated to be
important by bond dissociation energies have not been studied thoroughly. Wardlaw and

knowledge.

calculations is difficult, as they are barrierless, and the radical-radical interaction potential in

the transition state region exhibits strong multireference electronic character. Furthermore, a
number of the modes are strongly coupled with significant deviation from harmonic oscillator
behavior. The prediction of the pressure dependence is complicated by the dependence
on thermochemical data and energy transfer parameters. 12 Experimental kinetics data
are sparsely available for radical-radical pathways due to the challenges of generating and
monitoring radicals and the complications of secondary reactions. As a result, the experimental
data that are available often display high uncertainty.
In the interest of developing a complete high fidelity combustion kinetics model for PFAS,
we have undertaken a study of reactions R1 – R5 below. Reactions R1 – R4 are the association
reactions of the C1 − C3 unbranched n-perfluoroalkyl radicals to form the C2 − C4 unbranched
n-perfluoroalkanes. Reaction R5 is the bimolecular well-skipping reaction over the C4 F10
well.

High-pressure-limit rate coefficients for the association reactions were obtained using a
rigorous direct dynamics approach within the variable-reaction-coordinate transition-state
theory (VRC-TST) formalism. Thermochemistry was calculated using composite schemes,
laddered to reduce uncertainties, and collisional energy transfer parameters were evaluated
both by direct dynamics and by analogy to similar systems. Then, a master equation (ME)
approach was used to obtain the reverse dissociation rate constants and examine the falloff
behavior.

2. Methods
2.1 High-Pressure-Limit Rate Coefficients
2.1.1 VRC-TST
The barrierless nature of radical-radical reactions correlates with a large variation in the
location and form of the transition state dividing surface with excess energy. In particular, at
low temperatures, enthalpic effects are most important and the transition state lies at large
radical-radical separations. At higher temperatures, the decrease in entropy with decreasing
separation pushes the transition state towards shorter separations. Within variational
transition-state theory (VTST), the variationally optimal estimate for the reactive flux is
provided by its minimum with respect to some reaction coordinate such as the separation
distance.
The traditional procedure for implementing VTST assumes that rigid-rotor harmonicoscillator (RRHO) approximations (with corrections, such as hindered-rotor assumptions for
intermolecular bending modes) are valid along a minimum-energy reaction path (RP), and
relies on determination of normal-mode harmonic frequencies and moments of inertia along
the reaction path. This approach is thus known as RP-VTST. 13
For radical-radical reactions, the transition state typically lies at separations where the
radical-radical bending motions are not well described as either harmonic oscillators or
free rotors. An alternative procedure called “flexible TST” uses an approximate separation
into what are essentially “conserved” vibrational modes of the radicals and the remaining
“transitional” modes describing the relative and overall rotations of the radicals. 14,15 This
separation allows for a fully-coupled anharmonic treatment of the radical-radical bending and
rotational degrees of freedom. Within this approach, the number of energetically accessible
quantum states of the transition state for a given energy E and total angular momentum
J, N ‡ (E, J), can be evaluated as a convolution of a direct quantum sum for the conserved
mode contribution with a classical phase-space-integral (PSI) treatment of the transitional

mode contribution. This approach is popular for its accurate treatment of issues involving
low-frequency modes. However, in its original formulation, it assumes that the reaction
coordinate is defined by the radical-to-radical center-of-mass separation distance, which fails
at short separations, especially when the reactive site is far from the center-of-mass within a
given fragment. 16
The variable-reaction-coordinate (VRC) approach 17–21 represents an improvement on
the center-of-mass-based flexible TST by incorporating variation in the reaction coordinate
definition as well. In other words, both the value and the definition of the reaction coordinate
are variationally optimized, affording superior descriptions of the reaction coordinate at
short fragment separation, while retaining the classical PSI treatment of transitional mode
contributions. Monte Carlo sampling of the transitional modes and subsequent integration
of the classical PSI representation of the transition-state partition function, are commonly
carried out via direct dynamics (i.e., with “on-the-fly” potential evaluations of the sampled
geometric orientations). 16 The optimal dividing surface at a given temperature T is obtained
by variationally minimizing the resulting fragment association rate coefficient with respect to
both the value and the definition of the generalized reaction coordinate.
Within the VRC-TST approach, the radicals are assumed to rotate about arbitrarily
located “pivot points”. The reaction coordinate is then defined in terms of a fixed separation
between these pivot points. The full variational optimization then is carried out for both
the pivot point location and the separation between them. These optimizations are usually
accomplished through grid-based evaluations of the numbers of available states, N (E,J) . In
some instances, it is effective to include multiple pivot points on each radical, which leads to
a multifaceted transition-state dividing surface. 19
In this work, we employed the VRC-TST approach with direct evaluations of the interaction
energies (using multireference electronic structure theory as described in the following
subsection). The pivot points were placed either directly at the location of the radical site
on each fragment, or on both faces of the reacting fragment at distances ranging from 0.26

to 0.79 Å from the radical site and along the appropriately defined axis. As many as 48
dividing surfaces were constructed for each reaction by considering point-to-point separation
distances ranging from 2.1 to 10.6 Å. Monte Carlo orientational sampling was terminated
upon achieving integration uncertainties below a 3% threshold, sometimes requiring as many
as 4000−5000 samplings and single-point energy evaluations for each face of a given dividing
surface.

2.1.2 Radical-Radical Interaction Potentials
The nature of the radical-radical interaction potential in the transition-state region (roughly
2 − 5 Å, where the magnitudes of long-range van der Waals and bonding forces are similar)
requires the use of multireference methods in the direct potential evaluations. Here, these
direct potential evaluations in the VRC-TST calculations were carried out using completeactive-space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2). 22 Fragments were kept rigid in
their asymptotic equilibrium geometries, obtained at the same level of theory. Active spaces
for all multireference calculations described in this work were chosen to be (2e,2o), in order to
allow the molecule to properly dissociate into fragment radicals at large separations. Based
on prior literature on multireference potential energy surfaces using VRC-TST, 23 a real level
shift of 0.2 and an ionization potential electron affinity (IPEA) shift of 0.25 eV were used for
all complete-active-space calculations.
For computational feasibility, the cc-pVDZ basis set was used in the direct potential
evaluations. Higher accuracy is obtained by accounting for limitations in (i) the CASPT2
method, (ii) the small cc-pVDZ basis set, and (iii) fragment geometry relaxation effects,
through the development of orientation-independent one-dimensional correction terms. These
correction term evaluations are based on explicit calculations for R1, as a function of the
radical-radical separation distance, RCC . To correct for method and basis set limitations,

basis set. 25–27 Single-point energies along this fully-relaxed MEP were obtained using explicitlycorrelated and Davidson-corrected multireference configuration interaction with the same
basis set, MRCI-F12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12. 28–32
Additionally, a so-called “spin-splitting” approach was also used, taking advantage of
the use of high-accuracy single-reference methods to describe the energy of the triplet state
along the MEP. 12,33 The energy of the triplet state was evaluated using explicitly-correlated
coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations and perturbative connected triples,
employing a restricted spin Hartree-Fock reference wavefunction, RHF-UCCSD(T)-F12b, 34–36
along with an aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 basis. Then, the energy of the singlet state was obtained by
calculating singlet-triplet energy gaps using both of the high-accuracy multireference methods
considered, CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 and MRCI-F12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12. These
spin-splitting-based values are expected to be less sensitive to the multireference method
used for singlet-triplet gaps. An average of the two spin-splitting approaches is used as the
final reference energy in determining the correction potential.
The accuracy and uncertainty of the various correction potentials in the transition state
region is discussed in Section 3.1. The final correction potential is taken as the difference
between the average spin-splitting energies on the relaxed CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12
MEP geometries and the CASPT2/cc-pVDZ energies along a constrained D3d MEP in which
the asymptotic equilibrium CASPT2/cc-pVDZ radical geometries were kept rigid.
The magnitude and importance of geometry relaxation effects for perfluoroalkyl radical
combinations can be separately gauged entirely at the CASPT2/cc-pVDZ level, through the
evaluation of the constrained rigid MEPs previously mentioned. In other words, the geometry
relaxation component to the total correction is simply the difference between relaxed and
rigid MEPs at CASPT2/cc-pVDZ as a function of the separation distance. The implications
of this analysis are further discussed in Section 3.1.
Due to the large size of the considered systems, we were forced to use a more internallycontracted version 37 of CASPT2 for the potential evaluations for R2 – R4. Since geometry

methods with large basis sets were computationally infeasible for these systems, we chose to

This approach has been successful before when applied to similar alkyl-alkyl analogues. 21
The rate coefficients include an electronic degeneracy correction of 1/4 to account for the
reaction occurring solely on the ground singlet spin state. For the self-association reactions
R1 and R4, an additional correction factor of 1/2 was applied to account for symmetry effects.
Finally, a dynamical correction factor of 0.85 was applied across all cases to account for
recrossing effects. 21,38

2.2 Thermochemistry
The high-pressure limit for the reverse dissociation rate constants have a strong sensitivity to
reaction enthalpies, as do the pressure-dependent rate constants in both directions. Thus,
it is desirable to obtain high accuracy estimates for the reaction enthalpies. To this end,
we used the connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) technique 39 for systematically constructing
error-cancelling reaction schemes in conjunction with the laddered CBH-ANL approach. 40 The
first (CBH0), second (CBH1), third (CBH2), and fourth (CBH3) rungs of the CBH schemes
have been used in this work. These reactions would fall under the “isogyric”, “isodesmic”,
“hypohomodesmotic”/“isoatomic”, and “hyperhomodesmotic” reaction classes respectively,
in the hierarchy put forth by Wheeler et al. 41 As shown in the Supporting Information,
CBH0 was used for the target species CF3 , CBH2 for C2 F5 and C2 F6 , and CBH3 for C3 F7 ,
C3 F8 and C4 F10 . The required reference species for these schemes have also been considered
as shown in Table S1. A laddering scheme of successive quantum chemistry methods was
used to construct the different CBH level references. CBH0 reference species for each element
in consideration (H, C, and F) were selected as H2 , CH4 , and HF, for which enthalpies of
formation at 0 K were sourced from the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT), V1.202. 42–44
We also used ATcT values for H to define a reference radical enthalpy of formation.

2.2.1 Composite Electronic Structure Theory
The thermochemistry was calculated according to a set of high-level composite quantum chemistry methodologies based on a CCSD(T)/CBS+HOE+CV+REL+DBOC+SO+ZPVE+ANH
strategy (outlined below) inspired by the ANL0/ANL1 family of methods. 45 The method at
which every component of each CBH reaction energy was obtained is outlined in Table S1,
using abbreviations for the basis sets. For each entry in Table S1, the single-point energies
for all the species used in the given CBH scheme were treated at the specified level of theory,
using converged minimum structures at the level of theory indicated for geometries.
For the smaller systems, the basis CBH reaction energies have been obtained from CCSD(T)
energies at the complete-basis-set, CBS, limit computed using either RHF-UCCSD(T)F12b/cc-pVnZ-F12 or RHF-UCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVnZ. The cc-pVnZ-F12 series provided more
rapid basis set convergence, but for some of the smaller species it appears that the aug-cc-pVnZ
series provided more reliable convergence. For robustness where possible, both estimates of
the CCSD(T)/CBS energies were computed and averaged. Up to the cc-pV5Z-F12 and augcc-pV6Z basis sets have been used. For larger systems, RHF-UCCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVnZ-F12
energies (with CBS extrapolation where possible) were used.
A correction term for higher-order excitations, HOE, was incorporated whenever computationally feasible by taking the difference of UHF-UCCSDT(Q) and RHF-UCCSD(T)
energies at the cc-pVnZ basis, and if possible, the difference of UHF-UCCSDTQ(P) and UHFUCCSDT(Q) energies as well. 46,47 Core-electron correlation and core-valence interactions,
CV, are accounted for by a correction term composed of the difference between all-electron
RHF-UCCSD(T,Full) calculations and frozen-core RHF-UCCSD(T) calculations using the
cc-pwCVnZ or aug-cc-pwCVnZ basis sets. 48 The aug-cc-pwCVnZ series was included here as
we found that the inclusion of diffuse functions improves basis set convergence for the CV
correction in fluorine-containing species. Scalar relativistic effects, REL, were accounted for by
taking the difference between RHF-UCCSD(T) energies with and without the Douglas-KrollHess relativistic one-electron integrals using the aug-cc-pwCVnZ-DK basis sets. 49 Diagonal

Born-Oppenheimer corrections, DBOC, were computed at CCSD/cc-pVnZ for smaller species
or HF/cc-pVnZ for larger species based on computational feasibility. Spin-orbit effects, SO,
were not considered as significant for the species used in this work, as indicated in Table S1.
All reaction energies were corrected by the zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE),
computed at the highest possible level of theory based on converged minimum geometries at
the same level of theory, ensuring that imaginary (negative) frequencies were not present.
For smaller species (typically 7 to 8 heavy atoms or less), the CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVnZF12 methods were used, and for larger species, the double-hybrid and dispersion-corrected
density functional method, B2PLYP-D3(BJ), was used with the cc-pVnZ basis sets. 50–53
Anharmonicity corrections (ANH) were computed using second-order vibrational perturbation
theory (VPT2), implemented at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVnZ levels for smaller species and at
the B2PLYP-D3(BJ)/cc-pVnZ levels for larger species. 54 For species with torsional modes,
the corresponding harmonic frequency was replaced and corrected by the one-dimensional
hindered-rotor model, 55 with internal rotation potentials evaluated at B2PLYP-D3(BJ)/ccpVTZ.
CBS limits were estimated using two-point extrapolation forms, with coefficients of 0.46
for DZ-TZ energy extrapolations, 0.69 for TZ-QZ energy extrapolations, 0.93 for QZ-5Z
energy extrapolations, 1.20 for 5Z-6Z energy extrapolations, 0.50 for TZ-F12/QZ-F12 energy
extrapolations, 0.80 for QZ-F12/5Z-F12 energy extrapolations, and 0.5 for all TZ-QZ and
TZ-F12/QZ-F12 frequency, ZPVE, and VPT2-based anharmonicity correction extrapolations.
The thermochemical parameters were fitted to 7-coefficient NASA polynomials 56 in both
the CHEMKIN and Cantera formats. 57,58 The computed enthalpies of formation at 0 K for
both reference and target species are given in the Supporting Information in Table S1.
Comparisons of the enthalpies of formation at 0 K for the target species with recent literature
values is shown in Table 1, shown with the level of theory at which the literature values
were reported. Overall, excellent agreement is observed for the smaller species, and slightly
larger discrepancies for the larger species. We recommend the usage of the present results

2.3 Pressure-Dependent Rate Constants
Temperature-dependence and pressure-dependence of the phenomenological rate coefficients
were modeled by solving the one-dimensional master equation (ME) using ab initio based
Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory at the E-resolved (microcanonical) level to
predict the microscopic rates. To avoid numerical instabilities and low eigenvalue issues, well
truncation was implemented by setting a maximum of 10 for the ratio of the dissociation limit
to the temperature. Below this threshold, all energy states were assumed to be Boltzmannpopulated. A temperature grid ranging from 200−3000 K and a pressure grid ranging from
0.001−100 atm have been used.

2.3.1 Collision Models
The collisional energy transfer behavior for each system were represented by the single
exponential down model, parameters for which were drawn by analogy to similar hydrocarbon
systems. 64,65 Calculated values of the collisional energy transfer range parameter α = ⟨∆Ed ⟩
were drawn from the classical trajectory simulations of Jasper and used directly in the
single exponential down form. 64 Analogies were made by comparison to hydrocarbons with
both the same number of heavy atoms (Nheavy = 8 for C2 F6 , Nheavy = 11 for C3 F8 , and
Nheavy = 14 for C4 F10 ) and analogous heavy-atom connectivity. To compute the collision
frequencies, Lennard-Jones collision parameters (collision diameter σ and well depth ε) were
estimated for the C2 F6 and C3 F8 systems with an N2 bath gas, by direct dynamics. The

intermolecular potentials were evaluated at the DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level for various
different sampled orientations, and Lennard-Jones parameters were determined using onedimensional minimizations within each sampled orientation. 65 For the largest system, C4 F10 ,
falloff behavior of the corresponding reactions is predicted to be minimal, with limited
sensitivity of the RRKM/ME calculations to the chosen Lennard-Jones collision model. So,
instead of an expensive direct dynamics approach, Lennard-Jones parameters are instead
simply estimated by empirical fitting, based on scaling the calculated parameters for C2 F6
and C3 F8 by the ratios of Lennard-Jones parameters estimated from the number of heavy
atoms. 64 Table S2 shows the complete set of input parameters for the collision models used
in the RRKM/ME calculations, with 95% confidence intervals reported for the Lennard-Jones
parameters that were determined by direct dynamics.

2.4 Software
VRC-TST calculations were implemented in the VaReCoF program. 66 The OneDMin code was
used for the estimation of Lennard-Jones parameters. 67 Electronic structure calculations
using density functional theory were performed in Gaussian09 and Gaussian16, 68,69 and
wavefunction methods were performed in MOLPRO, 70–72 as well as the MRCC program 73,74
extension to MOLPRO for the implementation of coupled-cluster theory with higher order
excitations for open-shell species and for CCSDTQ(P) and beyond for closed-shell species.
Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (DBOC) and CCSDT(Q) calculations for closed-shell
species were implemented in the CFOUR program. 75 The MESS program was used for master
equation calculations. Subroutines for automating the workflow of composite thermochemistry
and master equation kinetics computations were sourced from the AutoMech package. 76

To gauge the appropriateness of a CASPT2/cc-pVDZ potential for the VRC-TST calculations,
various potential corrections as described in Section 2.1.1 were benchmarked against the
chosen standard of the average of spin-splitting approaches with singlet-triplet gaps obtained
with both MRCI-F12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 and CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12. In the
shorter range, it is expected that the more rigorous and expensive configuration interaction
(CI) energies are more accurate. However, in the long range, the lack of size consistency in
truncated CI implementations indicates that the CASPT2 potential may be more accurate.
Furthermore, geometry relaxation effects are neglected in the orientational sampling
procedure within the VRC-TST calculation, and the correction to the potential must account
for this effect as well. The following describes calculations performed to construct the onedimensional orientation-independent correction term for the CASPT2/cc-pVDZ potential, as
a function only of the radical-radical separation coordinate, RCC [Å].
The geometry relaxation component to the total correction is gauged using the difference
between relaxed and rigid CASPT2/cc-pVDZ potentials along the D3d MEP), as shown in
Figure 1 as a function of the radical-radical separation distance, RCC . These corrections
are very small due to the strongly non-planar C3v geometry of CF3 requiring minimal rearrangement as the radicals approach each other. In contrast, with the analogous hydrocarbon

Figure 1: Geometry relaxation component of the correction potential for CF3 +CF3 association
MEP based on relaxed and rigid CASPT2/cc-pVDZ energies.

The correction potential for overcoming method and basis set limitations is given by the
difference between the higher level energies obtained for the CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12
fully relaxed D3d MEP and the CASPT2/cc-pVDZ energies on the same MEP. The multiple
options for this correction potential are plotted along the CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12
D3d MEP in Figure 2a. The total correction term is given by the sum of the component for
geometry relaxation and the component for method and basis set limitations. With respect
to the average spin-splitting potential (taken as the reference), the percentage deviations of
the other potentials along the MEP are shown in Figure 2b, while the correction potential
and its percentage relative to the total potential are shown in Figure 2c.

In the long range, all the spin-splitting potentials are in somewhat good agreement. It
can be speculated that both the lack of size consistency and the internal contraction error in
the configuration interaction calculations lead to the discrepancy in the MRCI-F12+Q/augcc-pVTZ-F12 potential, and it is seen that the spin-splitting approach resolves the issue when
the singlet-triplet gap is calculated using the same multireference method. In the shorter
range, the potentials computed with the pure CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 calculation
and the spin-splitting approach with CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 singlet-triplet gaps
do not significantly differ. Similarly, the use of the spin-splitting approach with MRCIF12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 singlet-triplet gaps shows much closer agreement with the pure
MRCI-F12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 potential, which is likely to be the more accurate of the
two multireference approaches at shorter fragment separations. The average of the two
spin-splitting approaches is likely to be most accurate overall in the transition state region.
Based on these findings, the use of a CASPT2/cc-pVDZ potential along with the correction
based on the average of the spin-splitting approaches, is taken to be the reference method in
subsequent potential evaluations for the calculation of high-pressure-limit rate coefficients
by VRC-TST. These conclusions are further validated in Figure 2b and Figure 2c. The
small correction potential validates the high-level-corrected CASPT2/cc-pVDZ approach in
yielding a high accuracy in the predicted rate coefficients.
To gauge the uncertainty arising from the choice of potential correction term, a simple
test was performed. VRC-TST rate coefficients were evaluated with each correction term,
and also with no correction term, using a single dividing surface defined by two pivot points
on each CF3 fragment. The pivot points were located approximately 0.5 Å from each face
of the radical site along the C3v axis of the CF3 . The point-to-point separation distance
was set at approximately 3.5 Å. This corresponds to the optimal canonical transition-state
dividing surface between approximately 600−800 K. The results of this calculation are shown
in Figure 3, and the trend of the magnitudes of the rate coefficients in the optimal region
are in the reverse order of the trend seen in the potentials from Figure 1.

The pure CASPT2/cc-pVDZ predictions are too high, and the predictions obtained
using the correction factors obtained from MRCI-F12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 calculations
are too low. Using the correction factors obtained from the spin-splitting approach with
singlet-triplet gaps obtained from CASPT2-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 calculations makes almost
no difference with respect to using the corrections obtained from pure CASPT2-F12/aug-ccpVTZ-F12 calculations. The use of corrections obtained from the spin-splitting approach
with MRCI-F12+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 singlet-triplet gaps gives more intermediary results.

C2 F6 can be found in Figure 4. The predictions based on two pivot points are more
robust, as the positioning of pivot points on either face of the radical fragment gives a
superior description of the variational transition states and yields lower rate constants than
the predictions based on a single pivot point, illustrating the benefits of constructing a
multifaceted dividing surface in providing more accurate results. The present results are also
compared with the flexible TST results of Wardlaw and co-workers, which employed a more
empirical potential energy surface and were constrained to a reaction coordinate given by the
center-of-mass separation distance. 11 These prior calculations agree with the present ones to
within about a factor of two.
The contribution of the four faces of the multifaceted dividing surface when using two
pivot points follows a trend based on steric and electronic effects. The four faces are termed
“front-to-front”, “front-to-back” (equivalent to “back-to-front”), and “back-to-back”. Here,
given the non-planar C3v symmetry of CF3 , the “front” side refers to the face defined by
the pivot point located on the side of the radical opposite the fluorines, and the “back”
side refers to the face defined by the pivot point located on the same side as the fluorines.
The pivot point placement defining the multifaceted dividing surface for CF3 + CF3 are
illustrated as a representative example in Figure S1. The front-to-front path, with the
two maximum density radical lobes pointing toward each other, is the most energetically
favorable approach. Lower steric effects are also expected for this path. At low temperatures,
the front-to-front contribution to the total flux is about 60–65%, the front-to-back and
back-to-front contributions are roughly 15% each, and the contribution of the back-to-back
approaches is already minimal at around 5–10%. At 1000 K, the back-to-front and front-toback contributions are about 5% each, and the back-to-back contribution is negligible. At
2500 K, the back-to-front and front-to-back contributions decreases to about 2% each.

3.2 Size-Dependence of n-Cn F2n+1 Radical Association Kinetics

self-association of C2 F5 , were treated using the same dynamically-corrected VRC-TST and

RRKM/ME approaches as described above. The same correction term for the interaction
potential was used as well. This assumption of minimal changes in the interfragment correction
potentials, is based on previous precedent in the study of alkyl radical combinations,, 21 as
well as minimal changes in the geometry relaxation contribution to the correction term, which
was already small to begin with. Figure S2, Figure S3, and Figure S4 show the same
dependence of the theoretical predictions on correction potential and pivot point treatment
for the high-pressure-limit rate coefficients for each remaining case.
To study the size-dependent properties of the n-perfluoroalkyl associations, the highpressure-limit rate coefficients for the four reactions considered have been plotted together in
Figure 6. For the self-association reactions, the symmetry factor of 2 has been re-incorporated
into the rate coefficients to properly compare the trends as the participating n-perfluoroalkyl
chains grow in size. The observed behavior is further explained by the potentials along the
highest-possible-symmetry MEPs for each of the cases, shown in Figure 7 and adjusted by
the potential correction constructed as described earlier.
At all temperatures, the self-association reaction of C2 F5 possesses the lowest rate coefficient. Both steric and electronic effects can contribute to this behavior. Bulky trifluoromethyl
groups attached to not one, but both fragments involved, generate comparatively unfavorable
steric effects along the reaction coordinate, and the potential along the MEP is also seen to be
less attractive than for all the other cases. At higher temperatures, the self-association reaction of CF3 possesses a consistently higher rate coefficient than both of the cross-association
reactions. Given that the optimal transition-state dividing surfaces at these temperatures
are located at shorter separation distances, the observed trend can be explained by steric
effects. At lower temperatures, the optimal transition-state dividing surfaces are located at
further separations. Thus, the higher coefficients for the cross-association reactions can likely
be justified by their more attractive potentials along their MEPs. As temperatures rise into
more intermediate levels, a combination of the steric and electronic effects described above
appear to determine the size-dependent behavior of the association rate constants.

4. Conclusions
Comprehensive kinetics and reaction thermochemistry have been predicted for the four radical
association reactions forming the C2 − C4 n-perfluoroalkanes, as well as the bimolecular
well-skipping reaction over the C4 F10 well. A high-level correction potential for CASPT2/ccpVDZ direct dynamics potential evaluations in VRC-TST has been developed for CF3 + CF3
based on spin-splitting approaches, and implemented in the calculation of high-pressure-limit
rate coefficients. ANL0/ANL1-like composite quantum chemistry methodologies have been
used to compute enthalpies of formation for the target species using the CBH0, CBH1, CBH2,
and CBH3 rungs of the error-cancelling reaction schemes. This combination of ANL schemes
and CBH schemes provide low uncertainty in the computed enthalpies of formation.
Computed enthalpies of reaction and estimates of transport parameters and collision
models have been used with ab initio-based RRKM theory and the one-dimensional master
equation to obtain the microscopic rates, high-pressure-limit canonical rate coefficients, and
pressure-dependent kinetics. Both high-pressure-limit and pressure-dependent kinetics are
reported in the form of modified Arrhenius expressions that are reasonably well-fitted and
are designed for logarithmic interpolation. Computed thermochemical parameters for the
perfluoroalkyl radicals and perfluoroalkanes considered in this work have been also been
fitted to 7-coefficient NASA polynomials and reported in standardized formats.
Below, the enthalpies of reaction at 0 K and the high-pressure limit fitted rate expressions
(valid between 200 K and 3000 K) are reported for each of the reactions studied in this
work. We expect these expressions to prove useful in future modeling studies. The sizedependent trends of the radical combinations are affected by both steric and electronic
phenomena, and these considerations can be implemented heuristically in estimate the rates
of radical combinations for larger species. With these considerations in mind, the reported rate
expressions should be useful in rule-based extrapolations to larger molecules (e.g., geometric
mean rule), especially in the high pressure limit.
