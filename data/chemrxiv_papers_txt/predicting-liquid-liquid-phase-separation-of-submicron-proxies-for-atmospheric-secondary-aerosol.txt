Abstract
Liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation (LLPS) of atmospheric aerosols can significantly
impact climate, air quality, and human health. However, their complex composition,
small size, and history-dependent properties result in great uncertainty in the modeling
of aerosol phase state and atmospheric processes. Herein, using cryogenic transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), we examined model submicron aerosols composed
of organic compounds and ammonium sulfate, and established a parameterization for
the separation relative humidity (SRH) that accounts for chemical composition, particle
size, and equilibration time. We evaluated different variables that describe chemical
composition: O/C ratio, partition coefficient, solubility, molar mass, and polarizability.
The O/C ratio fits the SRH of micrometer droplets best, and by using a scaling factor
to translate the micrometer SRH parameterization to submicron aerosols, we
incorporate the effects of size and equilibration time. The measured scaling factor for
the submicron mean SRH (30nm ‚Äì 1ùúám, 20 min equilibration times) is 0.80, the factor
becomes 1 with equilibration time over 1 hour, and is equal to 0, meaning that SRH is
absent, when the aerosol dry diameter is smaller than 30 nm. Our parameterization will
aid in universal SRH modeling, potentially leading to more accurate predictions of
aerosol mass, optical properties, hygroscopicity, and heterogeneous chemistry.
Keywords: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), atmospheric secondary aerosols,
submicron aerosol, separation relative humidity (SRH), O/C ratio.

chemical composition, size, and time evolution.

Introduction
Aerosol particles are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. They have significant effects
on the Earth‚Äôs climate via direct and indirect interactions, determine air quality via
multiphase physics and chemistry, and impact public health via human exposure.1‚Äì5
Atmospheric secondary aerosol particles, mainly composed of organic and inorganic
compounds, is one of the most abundant species of the total aerosol loading. Field
studies across the world show that organic compounds contribute to a large mass
fraction of secondary aerosol particles (20-90 wt%).6‚Äì8 The formation and evolution
of atmospheric secondary aerosol particles involves various chemical and physical
processes, and aerosol phase state is one of the key determining factors that dictates
the role of secondary aerosol particles in the atmosphere.9 Following changes in
ambient relative humidity (RH), the aerosol water activity shifts, resulting in phase
transition processes such as liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation (LLPS), homogeneous
mixing mediated by water, efflorescence, and deliquescence.3 LLPS of internally
mixed organic/inorganic aerosol particles often occurs at relatively high RH, leading
to separation into an organic-rich phase and an inorganic-rich phase, both with
correspondingly high aerosol water activity (as imposed by the modified Raoult‚Äôs law
and, for submicron-sized particles, the K√∂hler equation, both of which take nonideality into account).10 Additionally, once LLPS occurs in organic‚Äîinorganic
secondary aerosols, it often persists at least down to the efflorescence RH, the low RH
levels where inorganic salts like ammonium sulfate crystallize. The occurrence of
LLPS significantly changes aerosol mixing state and morphology, which can impact

gas‚Äìparticle partitioning, heterogeneous chemistry, cloud condensation nuclei
activity, and ice nucleation.11
Due to its complex composition, atmospheric secondary aerosol contributes a
great amount of uncertainty to our understanding of Earth‚Äôs climate and air quality.
To the best of our knowledge, no measurement technique can thoroughly resolve the
molecular composition of secondary aerosol particles; therefore, accurate prediction
of LLPS based on representative variables is vital for understanding atmospheric
processes and for improving atmospheric modeling. Much effort has been devoted to
the prediction of the separation relative humidity (SRH) of LLPS, which refers to the
RH at the occurrence of LLPS when dehydrating an aerosol from high RH. Using the
oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C ratio) as the key variable, parameterizations have been
established to predict the SRH.12‚Äì14 The parameterizations were estimated by fitting to
experimentally measured SRH values for secondary aerosol surrogates containing the
sole inorganic compound of ammonium sulfate. Phase separation between organic
species of different aqueous solubilities (e.g. primary and secondary organic aerosol)
has also been reported recently, and the separation relative humidity between primary
organic aerosol and secondary organic aerosol was also explained based on the O/C
ratio.15‚Äì17 Additionally, thermodynamic models can be used to predict the values of
SRH as a function of aerosol composition. The Aerosol Inorganic‚ÄìOrganic Mixtures
Functional groups Activity Coefficient model for nonideal mixing (AIOMFAC-LLE)
can predict the water activity change and phase diagram of LLPS when molecular
structure information about the system components is available.18‚Äì22 However,

limitations exist for current parametrizations. First, experimentally established
parameterizations for LLPS consider only the O/C ratio, and therefore overlook
distinctions between different oxygen-containing functional groups. Second, the use
of the thermodynamic model requires the exact composition of the system, which is
not accessible from field-collected samples without resorting to assumptions.23 Third,
the effects of aerosol physicochemical properties, such as size, equilibration time, and
aerosol pH, are not incorporated into the simple parameterization-based models.24‚Äì29
In our recent work, we have shown a size effect on SRH using cryogenic transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM): the SRH in submicron SOA particles is suppressed
or inhibited depending on their size.28,30‚Äì32 We also found that the suppression of SRH
in submicron aerosol particles is dependent on the equilibration time.31,33
Given these limitations, studies that can develop parameterizations for LLPS and
SRH of submicron secondary aerosol particles will improve our understanding of the
aerosol phase state by minimizing the uncertainty in the phase state prediction of
atmospheric secondary aerosol. A proper parameterization for aerosol SRH should
possess the following characteristics: i) accurately predict the presence of LLPS as
well as the value of SRH with variables that can effectively represent the chemical
composition of the organic component(s); ii) effectively reflect the effect of aerosol
size and equilibration time; iii) have a simple form that can be easily incorporated into
a large-scale atmospheric model. Considering the criteria, O/C ratio, molar mass,
octanol‚Äìwater partition coefficient (LogP, LogD, explained below), water solubility
(LogS), and the polarizability of the organic component are potential variables that

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4rh6c-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4374-6518 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

depict different physicochemical properties of molecules. The O/C ratio is widely
applied in atmospheric chemistry to roughly represent the degree of oxidation, the
hygroscopicity, and as an influential factor on phase transition processes including
LLPS.34‚Äì37 Along with the O/C ratio, the molar mass of organic components has been
investigated in a reduced-complexity thermodynamic model for organic-water binary
systems.38 LogP is defined as the logarithmically transformed partition coefficient
between octanol and water (i.e., log10(P); the same notation is used below for LogD
and LogS), assuming the species of interest is neutral in charge. LogD is the octanol‚Äì
water partition coefficient at a specific pH value. The LogS value represents the water
solubility of the organic species. All LogP, LogD, and LogS values are estimated at
room temperature (298 K). The polarizability of a molecule denotes the tendency of
the molecule to develop an induced dipole moment subjected to an electric field.
Polarizability can be particularly important when considering the interaction between
neutral organic molecules and electrolytes.
In this study, we measured the SRH of various organic/inorganic mixtures for
both micrometer droplets (1 ‚Äì 103 ¬µm in diameter) and submicron aerosol particles
(10 ‚Äì 103 nm in diameter). We established parameterizations for the presence of LLPS
and the value of SRH for submicron organic/inorganic particles using two methods: i)
numerical fits, including polynomial and sigmoidal fits, using a set of elected
variables (O/C ratio, LogP and LogD, LogS, polarizability) and the measured SRH, ii)
a scaling factor to predict the SRH for submicron aerosol particles using an
established parameterization for the SRH of micrometer droplets, i.e. to capture the

influence of particle size in this regime. Regarding (i), we investigated these different
parameterization variables and compared the results to a parameterization based only
on the O/C ratio. Regarding (ii), we calculated scaling factors that effectively connect
the SRH for micrometer droplets to the SRH for submicron aerosol particles with
consideration of the size effect and equilibration time. Our results suggest that a
scaling factor that accounts for the size and time effect on SRH of submicron aerosol
particles combined with the parameterization as a function of chemical composition
for micrometer droplets can result in an applicable prediction for LLPS of
atmospheric secondary aerosol particles.
Materials and Methods
LLPS of micrometer droplets. For our study, we selected organic components with
O/C ratios ranging from 0.33 to 0.67. The organic compounds used were 2methylglutaric acid (2MGA, O/C = 0.67), 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid (DMSA, O/C =
0.67), diethyl malonic acid (DEMA, O/C = 0.57), 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid (DMGA,
O/C = 0.57), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA, O/C = 0.57), DL-4-hydroxy-3methoxymandelic acid (HMMA, O/C = 0.56), PEG-400 (O/C = 0.56), 1,2,6-hexanetriol
(O/C = 0.5) and 2,5-hexanediol (O/C = 0.33) (Table 1). Each organic component was
mixed with ammonium sulfate (AS). The concentration of the solutions was 5 wt. %,
containing organic and inorganic components in a 2:1 mass ratio, respectively, in highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade water. The mass ratio was chosen
based on the typical mass fractions of organic and inorganic compounds for

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4rh6c-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4374-6518 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

atmospheric aerosol particles. In addition, the phase diagrams for SRH are usually flat
(Figure S2) for a wide range of organic mass fractions, thus the 2:1 mass ratio is
representative for the ternary mixture and a precise solute mass ratio is not that critical
for the purpose of SRH predictions. Aerosol particles were generated by spraying the
solution of interest onto hydrophobic glass slides. In the discussion, we will use the
name or abbreviations of the organic compounds (Table 1) to refer to the aerosol
composition, while all systems used are mixtures of an organic compound and AS.
The phase transitions of the aerosol particles were studied using a Nikon Eclipse
Ti2 microscope, with a 20√ó objective. The size of the particles ranges from 20 ¬µm ‚Äì
200 ¬µm in diameter. The hydrophobic slides were kept in a home-built environmental
chamber. The relative humidity (RH) was controlled by mixing wet and dry nitrogen
gas, and measured using a Vaisala HMP60 probe. Initially, the particles were dried at a
rate of ~10% RH/second, until complete efflorescence was observed (<10% RH). Next,
RH was increased at a uniform rate of 1% RH/min until deliquescence occurred. Once
all the particles deliquesced, the particles were equilibrated for 20 minutes. After
equilibration, RH was decreased at a uniform rate of 1% RH/min. Upon encountering
a phase transition (LLPS and efflorescence) during the RH reduction, the rate of
decrease of RH was reduced to approximately 0.5% RH/min. Images were collected at
5 min intervals. Reducing the rate at which the RH is changed allows us to observe the
phase transitions of the aerosol particles. However, changing the dehumidification rate
does not affect the SRH value of the systems studied.

Around 30 particles were characterized for every phase transition and the
separation RH (SRH), efflorescence RH (ERH) and deliquescence RH (DRH) were
determined for every particle (summarized in Table S1). For each system, the average
SRH, ERH and DRH were determined based on all corresponding imaged particles.

aerosol particles.31,39 An aqueous solution of the organic and inorganic components was
prepared in a 2:1 mass ratio at 0.05 wt.%. The composition of the aerosol particles used
for the study were the same as for the optical microscopy experiments described above.
Aerosol particles were generated using an atomizer (TSI 3076, TSI, Inc) and collected
in a Tedlar bag (RH > 90%). The desired RH was obtained by injecting dry N2 gas into
the Tedlar bag. The particle number concentrations were measured via a condensation
particle counter (CPC, TSI model 3752). The relative humidity was recorded using a
combined RH and temperature probe (Vaisala HMP 110, ¬±1.5% RH). We set the RH
using a binary search-like approach: first identifying the onset SRH and the final SRH,
then setting intermediate RH values to determine the mean SRH. The mean SRH,
represented by the average value and standard deviation, is calculated as the average
RH of all phase-separated particles between the onset and final SRH. After obtaining
the targeted RH, the particles were passed through a pre-cooled flow tube that is
approximately 220K inside, maintained by chilled nitrogen gas.39 The particles were
vitrified at a high cooling rate (> 3√ó109 K/s) and collected on copper mesh grids cooled
using dry ice.31,39 These grids are carefully stored in liquid nitrogen. Cryo holders were
precooled using liquid nitrogen in a cryo-station and the grid was transferred carefully
into the precooled holders. Particles were imaged using a Tecnai LaB6 and FEI Talos
Arctica G2 TEMs. A minimum of four experiments with different target RH levels were
conducted for each solution. At each RH, 100-200 images of different particles were
imaged and analyzed using Fiji software.

Parameterization of aerosol SRH. The estimation of the potential parameterization
variables, LogP, LogD (at pH 7.4), and LogS, of the organic compounds were
evaluated using the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity
(ADMET) model: ADMETLab 2.0. The model uses the multi-task graph attention
framework with the inclusion of 10370 molecules.40 The input to the model is the
simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) string characterizing the
molecular structure of each organic species. The estimated polarizability was
collected from the ChemSpider database (https://www.chemspider.com/). The
estimated LogP, LogD, LogS, and polarizability values are listed in Table S2.
AIOMFAC-LLE modeling. The AIOMFAC-LLE model was applied to estimate the
phase diagram and SRH for the systems of ammonium sulfate and the organic species
in Table 1.18‚Äì21 We calculated the phase diagrams of all organic/AS systems involved
in this study for a temperature of 298 K to evaluate the effect of functional groups and
their interactions with the inorganic ions and water on the phase diagram predicted from
this thermodynamic model (Figure S2).
Results and Discussion
Parameterization of SRH for Micrometer Organic/AS Particles. We conducted
optical microscopy measurements to characterize the SRH of micrometer aerosol
particles. The measured SRH values agree with values reported in other published
work, indicating the consistency of the SRH values across different studies for
micrometer droplets (Table 1). Such consistency validates the accuracy of our

measurement protocol. Previous studies have provided parameterizations of SRH for
micrometer SOA proxies. Based on the experimental data for the SRH of organic/AS
particles, two parametrizations were reported:

(Eqn. 2)

Both parametrizations were constructed using datasets that cover numerous
organic/inorganic mixture systems. However, the two parameterizations were based on
different datasets. The parameterization from Bertram et al. were generated using
second-order polynomial functions for ternary systems, which were composed of water,
a single organic compound that varied from system to system, and AS. Song et al. fitted
the data from Bertram et al. with the addition of several complex mixtures of up to ten
organic species using a sigmoidal function. Additionally, further experimental data
have been generated by Bertram and coworkers after these parametrizations were
published.14 Herein, we integrate all literature-reported SRH data for ternary systems
(Figure 1).12‚Äì14,41 The data for systems containing complex organic mixtures are not
included since other candidate variables that will be investigated in this study are
difficult to evaluate for complex organic mixtures. Detailed information about the
dataset can be found in Table S3. We tested both a polynomial function (second order

polynomial function) and a sigmoidal function (four-parameter logistic function) for
the parameterization (Figure 1a and 1b). Both the second-order polynomial fit and four
parameter logistic fit indicated a threshold O/C ratio at 0.8, in agreement with Song et
al. For the second-order polynomial fit, we set the lower bound of the O/C ratio for the
polynomial fit as 0.2, since no experimental data have been reported for these low O/C
values. The coefficient of determination (R2) value is 0.62 (Figure 1a, red curve),
improved from Bertram et al. (R2 is 0.15 for the expanded dataset shown here, Figure
1a, black curve). The updated parameterization is as follows:
SRH(%) = ,

For the sigmoidal fit, we applied the four-parameter logistic model with and
without the robust fitting (Figure 1b). The four-parameter logistic fit (4PL) without
robust fitting also has a R2 value of 0.62. The four-parameter logistic fit with the least
absolute residuals (4PL-LAR) robust fitting method better depicts the threshold value
(the O/C value that differentiates LLPS from homogeneous particles) with a higher R2
value of 0.85. Both 4PL and 4PL-LAR fits are improved compared to the
parameterization by Song et al., which returns a R2 value of 0.49 for the combined
ternary system data (Figure 1b, grey curve). As the 4PL-LAR method provides a more
accurate threshold O/C value for LLPS, we elect the 4PL-LAR fit as a more credible
result:

We suggest that the sigmoidal fit is more robust given its value at extremely low O/C
values (< 0.2). Comparing to the second-order polynomial fit, the sigmoidal fit is
chemically more reasonable at low O/C ratios with the predicted SRH value
approaching 100%.

The SRH of Submicron Organic/AS Particles. We selected nine organic
compounds with a range of O/C ratios that represent atmospheric secondary organic
aerosol components with various functional groups and chemical structures (Table 1).
At relatively high O/C ratios (O/C ‚â• 0.56), we picked two to three organic species
with different molecular structures to investigate the effect of molecular structure on
submicron aerosol LLPS. The SRH of submicron aerosol particles are characterized
using the onset SRH, the final SRH, and the mean SRH. The onset SRH refers to the
RH value at which LLPS was observed for at least one aerosol particle during
dehumidification experiments. The final SRH denotes the highest RH value at which
all imaged aerosol particles with a sufficiently large diameter are phase separated.
Note that aerosol particles that are sufficiently small (dry diameter smaller than 30nm)
do not undergo LLPS.31,33,39 The mean SRH is the average of all phase-separated
aerosol particles between the onset SRH and final SRH. For example, the onset SRH
of 2,5-hexanediol is 78%, the final SRH is 52%, and the mean SRH is 64¬±6% (Figure
2a). The morphologies of the submicron organic/AS particles are characterized from
TEM images (Figure S1). A detailed description can be found in our previous
work.31,33,39 In brief, aerosol particles that undergo LLPS exhibit an inner phase
boundary with different image contrast (and associated refractive indices) inside and
outside the inner boundary, whereas homogeneous aerosol particles show no inner
phase boundary. The measured data are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table
1. The effect of molecular structure for organic compounds with the same O/C ratio is
discussed in the SI Section S3. The quantitative relationship between the measured

The Parameterization of SRH for Submicron Organic/AS Particles. The variation
in SRH between different organic/AS aerosol particles illustrates the complex effect
of molecular structure on SRH. To account for the variability in SRH between
different organic compounds, parameterization methods based on different chemical
variables were evaluated to optimize the prediction of SRH. Herein, we fit the SRH
for both micrometer and submicron aerosols with different variables that represent
different aspects of molecular properties. The SRH values for micrometer droplets are

identical to those in Figure 1, while the submicron aerosol SRH values include six
components measured in this study (Figure 2) and 2MGA-AS aerosols from our
previous study.33 Ideally, a parameterization method should fulfill the following
criteria: i) the independent variable of the parameterization is reasonable from the
perspective of physical chemistry; ii) the variable can differentiate the threshold for
the occurrence of LLPS; iii) the method can fit the experimental data and predict the
SRH sufficiently accurately for both micrometer and submicron sized aerosol
particles; and iv) the method can bridge the differences between the SRH values for
submicron aerosol and micrometer-sized droplets.
Following these criteria, we elected variables to represent the organic molecules
that may reflect the affinity of the organic compounds to inorganic-rich or organicrich phases: O/C ratio, LogP, LogD, LogS, molar mass, and the polarizability of the
organic compounds. The O/C ratio is presented in the main text, as it has been most
commonly used in the literature, and the other variables are presented in the SI section
S5. As the scattering of the O/C ratio data suggest a threshold value (Figure 3), a fourparameter logistic function (4PL) was used for O/C ratios. All other results are
displayed in Figures S5 ‚Äì S8. The fitted functions and R2 values are listed in Tables
S4 ‚Äì S7. The parameterization function should exhibit a threshold value that can
differentiate the homogeneous and LLPS morphology: below the threshold, the
corresponding organic aerosol particles do not undergo LLPS, whereas the functional
form of SRH can be determined above the threshold. Although there are some outliers

at O/C ratios below 0.8, the O/C ratio can distinguish between a homogeneous
morphology and LLPS, with a threshold value of 0.8.
For micrometer-sized droplets, the O/C ratio with 4PL-LAR fit showed the
highest R2 value of 0.85, whereas for other choices of the independent variable, the R2
values are lower (0.22 for LogP, 0.29 for LogD, 0.04 for LogS, 0.77 for molar mass,
and 0.54 for polarizability; see Tables S4 & S6). Using the O/C ratios and SRH values
reported in field campaigns and flow tube studies, we predicted the SRH using the
fitted 4PL-LAR model. The results were generally consistent, with discrepancies
arising from the complex inorganic salt composition and size differences (Table S8,
details discussed in SI Section S7).42‚Äì44 This further highlights the importance of
extending predictions to submicron aerosol particles.
For submicron particles, the R2 value of all considered variables, except for the
sigmoidal fit using O/C ratios (0.83) and the second-order fit using LogP (0.74), are
low (< 0.4, Table S5 & S7). Fits to variables besides the O/C ratio are discussed in the
SI. The variation in fits to SRH, especially for submicron aerosol particles, are large
no matter which parametrization variable is selected. We also note that the dataset is
limited, especially for the sigmoidal fits for O/C ratio, SRH data is absent in the
downward sloping region, which can cause inaccuracy in the fitting. Therefore, we
show that the O/C ratio showed correlation with SRH and can to some extent
distinguish aerosol morphology. Additionally, as discussed in the SI, polarizability
can distinguish aerosol morphology, and LogP showed a meaningful correlation with
submicron aerosol SRH; therefore, other variables merit future investigation.

in the legend stands for homogeneous aerosol particles.
As discussed above, when fitting the SRH of micrometer-sized droplets and
submicron aerosol particles independently, we achieved different sets of coefficients
for polynomial and sigmoidal functions. The fact that each dataset has its specific fit
is hard to apply in practice, as the fitted coefficients and polynomial orders are highly
dependent on the dataset, and the use of numerous functions can complicate the
application of the parameterization. Therefore, for complex systems such as
atmospheric aerosol particles, except for distinguishing the threshold and accurately
fitting the SRH, the parametrization methods should be practical, and the independent

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4rh6c-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4374-6518 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

variable used should be easy to measure and effectively predict LLPS. We therefore
designed a scaling factor that can relate the SRH of submicron aerosol particles to that
of micrometer-sized droplets. Since the O/C ratio provided the best correlation with
the SRH of micrometer droplets, we used a scaling factor based on the fit that uses
O/C as the independent variable. By dividing the onset SRH, the mean SRH, and the
final SRH of submicron aerosols by the mean SRH of micrometer droplets,
respectively, we found that the calculated ratios have similar values across all
organic/AS/water ternary systems investigated herein. We therefore defined the
scaling factor (SF) for the onset SRH, the mean SRH, and the final SRH of submicron
aerosol particles as a mean ratio of all SRH(nano)onset/SRH(micro),
SRH(nano)mean/SRH(micro), SRH(nano)final/SRH(micro) values collected in this
study. The SRH(micro) is the mean SRH value of micrometer droplets of each
organic/AS mixture. We have illustrated that the standard deviation of the measured
droplet SRH is low, and the measurement results are highly consistent across
experiments. Figure 4 shows the calculated ratios as a function of the O/C ratio. Plots
for LogP, molar mass, and polarizability are included in Figure S9. Given its
definition, all of the scaling factors achieved are universal for all variables. The
fluctuations of the data points around the fitted scaling factor are depicted in residual
plots (Figure S10). The scaling factor for the onset SRH of submicron aerosols,
ùëÜùêπ23456 is 0.91. The scaling factor for the mean SRH of submicron aerosols, ùëÜùêπ7583
is 0.80. The scaling factor for the final SRH of submicron aerosols, ùëÜùêπ9:38; is 0.69.
Given the distribution of the calculated ratios around the scaling factors, we

acknowledge that fundamentally each individual organic/AS system may have its own
degree of suppression of SRH of submicron aerosols compared to the SRH of
micrometer droplets. Herein, we established an empirical parameterization by
assuming a uniform suppression effect that is independent of the components of the
aerosol particles. However, future studies are needed to explore the underlying effects
of various organic structures over a broad range of molar masses and functionalization
degrees to achieve an accurate prediction of aerosol SRH on the basis of molecular
structure.

After determining the scaling factors, we applied the scaling factors to the fitted
curves for micrometer-sized droplets, thereby predicting the expected corresponding
SRH for submicron-sized particles. As shown in Figure 3, the orange dashed lines are
the scaled onset SRH, the blue dash lines are the scaled mean SRH, and the green

compared with experimental data in Figure 5. The blue points denote the comparison
between the experimental SRH for submicron aerosol particles and the predicated
SRH for submicron aerosol particles that was scaled from the SRH for micrometer
droplets. The prediction of SRH using the scaling factor showed a significant
correlation with the experimental measurements (R2=0.69). The shaded blue area
denotes the 95% confidence region. We also calculated the region of uncertainty
using the SFonset for onset SRH and SFfinal for the final SRH, and the region largely
coincides with the 95% confidence region. Submicron aerosol SRH predicted using
the scaling factors and the fitted functions for micrometer droplets based on all tested
variables (O/C ratio, LogP, LogS, LogD, molar mass, and polarizability) are also
evaluated in Figure 5. Even though the fitted parameterizations for most input
variables showed weak correlation with micrometer droplet SRH, most of the
predicted values for all variables lie in the 95% confidence region of the fit to the
experimental data. The results above indicate that the effect of aerosol size on SRH
can be effectively predicted using scaling factors, and the SFonset and SFfinal can
characterize the uncertainty of the SF prediction. The distribution of the predicted
SRH values in Figure 5 also suggests that the application of the scaling factor is not
sensitive to the parameterization, as most of the predicted SRH values from different
parametrizations lie in the uncertainty region established by the predicted onset and
final SRH. Thus, the scaling factor and the parametrization method can be optimized
independently with more experimental data, and the scaling factor for the size effect

droplets.

measurements of submicron aerosol SRH (x-axis). The blue solid circles indicate
submicron SRH predictions derived from micrometer droplet SRH measurements
using the scaling factor (labelled as Scaled_MicroSRH). The open markers represent
the predicted submicron aerosol SRH obtained through the combined

scaling factor. The predictions are labelled based on the variables used for
micrometer SRH fits: O/C ratio (sigmoidal fit, orange squares), LogP (polynomial fit,
green diamonds), molar mass (polynomial fit, red stars), polarizability (polynomial
fit, purple crosses), LogS (polynomial fit, brown upward triangles), and LogD
(polynomial fit, pink downward triangles). The black line represents the identity line
(y=x), and the blue dashed line shows the fit using the predicted Scaled_MicroSRH
and the Measured SRH (nano) for submicron aerosol particles. The grey shaded area
denotes the 95% confidence region of the linear fit (blue dashed line). The orange
shaded area represents the region between the onset SRH (orange dashed line) and
final SRH (green dashed line) predicted using the SFonset and SFfinal. Error bars
represent the standard deviations of the Measured SRH (nano) values. Since all
points at the same Measured SRH (nano) share identical error bars, only the error
bar for the blue solid circles is shown.
In our recent studies, we observed that for 2MGA-AS aerosols, the submicron
aerosol SRH converged with that of micrometer-sized droplets after 60 min
equilibration time, indicating a relatively slow, kinetically driven effect on the

suppressed SRH in submicron aerosol particles.33 Therefore, combining the size effect
and time evolution, we can depict the scaling factor for submicron aerosol SRH as a
function of aerosol diameter (D) and equilibration time (t): ùëÜùëÖùêª3832 =
ùëÜùëÖùêª7:<=2 √ó ùëÜùêπ(ùê∑, ùë°), where
ùëÜùêπ(ùê∑, ùë°) = ùõø(ùê∑) ‚àô ùëì(ùë°)

ùë° = 20 ùëöùëñùëõ
ùë° ‚â• 60 ùëöùëñùëõ

This expression indicates that: i) aerosol particles < 30 nm wet diameter remain
homogeneous regardless of the equilibration time (in this equation, this corresponds to
SRHnano = 0); ii) aerosol particles > 30 nm and with equilibration time = 20 min have
a scaling factor equal to the ones determined in this study (ùëÜùêπ7583 = 0.80, ùëÜùêπ23456 =
0.91, ùëÜùêπ9:38; = 0.69); iii) when aerosol particle diameter > 30 nm, and the
equilibration time ¬≥ 60 min, the ùëÜùëÖùêª3832 = ùëÜùëÖùêª7:<=2 . In addition, the uncertainty
can be estimated using the SFonset and SFfinal. We note that an equilibration time of 60
minutes may not be the shortest time required for reaching the equivalence SRHnano =
SRHmicro, and future experiments are needed to find the accurate threshold time. Once
the threshold equilibration time is confirmed, one can use that equilibration time to
substitute the 60 min in the current SF function. We also note that the scaling factors
are adequate for the equilibration time used herein (20 min) and may vary based on
the equilibration time for t < 20 min and 20 < t < 60 min. Our previous studies have
shown that the 20 min SRH is overall representative for 20 to 30 min equilibration

time,33 but additional characterization is needed to determine the range of scaling
factors for different equilibration times.
Environmental Implications. Using the SRH measured for a wide variety of
submicron organic/AS aerosol particles, we determined a parameterization for the
SRH of submicron organic/inorganic aerosol particles as a function of several
different variables describing the chemistry of the organic compound. According to
our evaluation, the use of a scaling factor (SF) applied to the SRH parameterization of
micrometer droplets can effectively estimate the SRH of submicron aerosol particles.
Compared to the interpolation of measured SRH using either polynomial or sigmoidal
fits, the combination of SFmean, SFonset, and SFfinal covers the variation of measured
submicron aerosol SRH, indicating that the scaling factor model can predict the mean
SRH and characterize the uncertainty for submicron aerosol SRH within reasonable
bounds considering the applications of these parameterizations. Current
parameterizations of SRH rely on experimental data of micrometer droplets and
model predictions under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. The scaling factor
method effectively connects a parameterization targeting submicron secondary
aerosol to the micrometer-droplet-based parameterization. The scaling factor method
enables the independent optimization of the scaling factor and the parametrization of
the SRH for micrometer droplets, respectively. In addition, the two parts can be
directly combined once an optimization of either part is achieved in future studies.
Note also that the cut-off size and equilibration time are both incorporated into the
scaling factor expression, as the size distribution and time evolution are significant

aspects of phase separation. Using the scaling factor established in this study along
with future optimizations for the chemical composition (e.g., O/C ratios, polarizability
etc.) of organic/inorganic aerosol particles, one can estimate the SRH for submicron
aerosol particles based on a given aerosol size distribution, the period of time under
stable conditions, and chemical composition.
In the meantime, we are aware of limitations of the current parameterization
methods for atmospheric aerosol LLPS. The size effect in our scaling factor merely
incorporates a cut-off size for the inhibition of submicron aerosol LLPS, as size
dependence between SRH and aerosol diameter is not yet observed with the collected
dataset. However, a more finely resolved size-dependent parameterization requires
future studies with more size-resolved measurements. In addition to size-resolved
experimental data, model predictions based on size-dependent thermodynamic models
accounting for interfacial tension effects on LLPS may also aid in determining
consistent size-dependence relationships for use in simpler parameterizations.45,46
For the LLPS dependence on aerosol composition, both inorganic and organic
components play critical roles. We acknowledge that this study, along with the
majority of literature studies, uses ammonium sulfate as the inorganic salt. Previous
studies have shown that variations in inorganic components can significantly impact
SRH.14,43,47 However, while developing parameterizations for different inorganic salts
is essential, it is currently not feasible due to the limited data available on this topic.
Regarding organic components, among the investigated variables in this study, the
O/C ratio showed the best fit in estimating the SRH for micrometer droplets and in

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4rh6c-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4374-6518 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

discerning the homogeneous and LLPS morphologies. Other independent variables,
such as polarizability, molar mass, and LogP, may also be applicable. However,
compared to O/C ratios and molar mass, parameters like polarizability and LogP, are
not easily accessible from field measurements since their estimation requires
molecular structure information (e.g., SMILES). For all tested variables, the
correlation between the variables and submicron aerosol SRH is weak overall. This
observation may be due to the combined effects of the chemical structure and the
aerosol size effect. Taking the O/C ratio as an example, organic compounds with high
O/C values may exhibit lower SRH in macroscopic systems yet tend to have a higher
surface tension in aqueous droplets. In submicron aerosol particles, the higher surface
tension can cause a stronger Kelvin effect, indicating a higher supersaturation (i.e.,
RH) for LLPS to occur.46,48 Conversely, organic compounds with lower O/C ratios
would have a higher SRH for micrometer droplets but a smaller Kelvin effect due to
lower surface tension. Such effects may lead to a dampening in the SRH-dependence
on the O/C ratio, especially for sub-100 nm droplets. Additionally, our previous work
has also shown an effect of aerosol pH on LLPS; thus, the proton activity may need to
be incorporated into future parameterizations.27 Therefore, advances in practical
parameterization methods that account for the protonation/deprotonation of functional
groups in organic/inorganic aerosol particles are still needed. In the atmosphere, the
gas-particle partitioning of aerosol particles, dictated by component volatility, is a key
process influencing the evolution of aerosol phase state, particularly for aerosol
particles containing highly volatile primary organic species. Future studies should

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4rh6c-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4374-6518 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

further explore the role of volatility as a parameter in LLPS for primary organic
aerosols.
For atmospheric modeling and the evolution of organic/inorganic aerosol phase
state, the aerosol size, composition, and ambient conditions may constantly change
over time. Thus, the coupling between the dynamic change of the physical properties
of atmospheric secondary aerosol particles and the scaling factor measured in this
study (ùëÜùêπ(ùê∑, ùë°)) requires further investigation. Moreover, applying the relationship
between the scaling factor and equilibration time to real atmospheric conditions
require consideration of the timescales of other physical and chemical processes (e.g.,
deposition, chemical reactions). Ultimately, the interplay between these characteristic
timescales will determine how the scaling factor should be applied in real atmospheric
scenarios.
This study shows that a parameterization based on chemical composition
(ùëì(ùê∂‚Ñéùëíùëö)) demands further optimization due to the weak correlation between the
investigated variables (O/C ratio, molar mass, LogP, LogS, and polarizability) and
aerosol SRH (both micrometer-sized and submicron). In the meantime, we have
shown that the scaling factor that depends on aerosol particle diameter and
equilibration time (ùëÜùêπ(ùê∑, ùë°)) is a promising parameterization for all proxy
atmospheric secondary aerosol particles studied here, which can be incorporated with
an accurate chemistry-based parametrization framework (ùëì(ùê∂‚Ñéùëíùëö)). Both the scaling
factor and the chemistry-based parametrization can be optimized independently with
an enlarged dataset, and can be directly combined together during application. Such a

parameterization method can be expressed as ùëÜùëÖùêª = ùëì(ùê∂‚Ñéùëíùëö) ‚àô ùëÜùêπ(ùê∑, ùë°). This form
of parametrization is simple to apply and can be easily updated to improve the
accuracy of SRH prediction. Accurate prediction of atmospheric aerosol phase state,
particularly the SRH, is significant in predicting the aerosol-related atmospheric
chemical and physical processes (e.g., gas-particle partitioning and heterogeneous
chemistry), which in turn impacts the climate, air quality, and human health.45,49 An
accurate parametrization framework to predict the SRH will effectively reduce the
uncertainty in atmospheric modeling.50
