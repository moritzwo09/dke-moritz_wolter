Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination has posed a significant environmental
and public health challenge due to their ubiquitous nature. Adsorption has emerged as a
promising remediation technique, yet optimizing adsorption efficiency remains complex due to
the diverse physicochemical properties of PFAS and the wide range of adsorbent materials.
Traditional modeling approaches, such as response surface methodology (RSM), struggled to
capture nonlinear interactions, while standalone machine learning (ML) models required
extensive datasets. This study addressed these limitations by developing hybrid RSM-ML models
to improve the prediction and optimization of PFAS adsorption. A comprehensive dataset was
constructed using experimental adsorption data, integrating key parameters such as pH, pH pzc,
surface area, temperature, and PFAS molecular properties. RSM was employed to model
adsorption behavior, while gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient
boosting (XGB) were used to enhance predictive performance. Hybrid models—linear, RMSEbased, multiplicative, and meta-learning—were developed and evaluated. The meta-learning
HOP-RSM-GB model achieved near-perfect accuracy (R² = 1.00, RMSE = 10.59),
outperforming all other models. Surface plots revealed that low pH and high pH pzc maximized
the adsorption while increasing log Kow consistently enhanced PFAS adsorption. These findings
establish hybrid RSM-ML modeling as a powerful framework for optimizing PFAS remediation
strategies. The integration of statistical and machine learning approaches significantly improves
predictive accuracy, reduces experimental costs, and provides deeper insights into adsorption
mechanisms. This study underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in environmental
engineering and highlights future opportunities for integrating ML-driven modeling with
experimental adsorption research.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals used extensively in
industrial applications and consumer products due to their chemical stability, thermal resistance,
and water- and oil-repellent properties. Commonly found in nonstick cookware, firefighting
foams, and water-resistant fabrics, PFAS has become pervasive in the environment, with
contamination detected in soil, air, and particularly water systems (McNamara et al., 2018;
Pramanik et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2018; Rostvall et al., 2018; D. Zhang et al., 2016a). These
“forever chemicals” are characterized by their resistance to degradation under natural conditions,
leading to their persistence in ecosystems and accumulation in biological organisms. The health
impacts of PFAS exposure have been widely documented, including links to immune
suppression, hormonal disruption, developmental delays in children, and increased risks of
cancers. As of 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established stringent
Maximum Contamination Levels (MCLs) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane
sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA),
and hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) dimer acid as 4, 4, 10, 10, and 10 ng/L, respectively (US
EPA, 2024). These limits underscore the urgency of developing effective remediation strategies
to protect public health and comply with regulatory standards.

Among remediation techniques, adsorption has emerged as a promising approach due to its costeffectiveness, scalability, and ability to target a wide range of PFAS compounds (Ross et al.,
2018). Adsorption involves the transfer of PFAS molecules from the aqueous phase to the
surface of a solid adsorbent, effectively reducing their concentration in contaminated water.
Various materials, including activated carbon, biochar, ion-exchange resins, and mineral-based
sorbents, have been explored as potential adsorbents. The efficiency of adsorption processes
depends on several factors, including the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and PFAS
molecules, as well as operational conditions such as pH, temperature, and adsorbent dose.

Optimizing adsorption performance is a complex task due to the interplay of these variables and
the diversity of PFAS compounds, which vary in molecular weight, chain length, hydrophobicity,
and functional groups. Traditional experimental approaches, such as one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT)
studies, are insufficient for capturing multidimensional interactions between variables and
require extensive time and resources. To overcome these challenges, advanced statistical and
computational methods are essential for systematically modeling and optimizing adsorption
systems.

Response surface methodology (RSM) is a powerful statistical tool that systematically explores
variable interactions and optimizes processes with fewer experiments (Abraham & Walsh, 1992;
Burg et al., 2003; Kamlet et al., 1985; Sinha et al., 2022; Sprunger et al., 2007; K. Zhang et al.,

2020). In PFAS studies, RSM has been used to optimize degradation and adsorption processes,
including PFOS removal via heterogeneous photocatalysis (83% removal in 8 hours) (de S.
Furtado et al., 2021), PFOA adsorption using alginate hydrogel (94.8 ± 2.1% removal) (Naim
Shaikh & Nawaz, 2024), and PFOA removal with layered double hydroxides and peroxydisulfate
activation (H. Yang et al., 2022). These investigations demonstrate RSM’s effectiveness in
optimizing operational parameters and adsorbent design for PFAS treatment under mild
conditions. However, its reliance on polynomial regression can limit capturing complex
nonlinear and higher-order interactions, suggesting the need for complementary approaches
when dealing with diverse PFAS compounds and adsorbents.

Machine learning (ML) offers advanced capabilities for modeling complex adsorption processes
by uncovering nonlinear relationships, variable interactions, and hidden patterns without relying
on predefined equations. Popular algorithms such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB),
and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) show high predictive accuracy and can rank the influence
of parameters (e.g., pH, hydrophobicity) on adsorption outcomes (Karbassiyazdi et al., 2022a).
However, large and diverse datasets are essential for accurate training an ML model, which can
be resource-intensive in PFAS research. Integrating response surface methodology (RSM) with
ML in hybrid models addresses this challenge: RSM generates structured datasets and identifies
key variables, while ML enhances predictive performance by capturing nonlinearities and higherorder interactions. Although hybrid models have been successfully applied to areas like
wastewater treatment and heavy metal adsorption, their use in PFAS adsorption remains limited,
highlighting a promising avenue for future research.

In PFAS adsorption studies, hybrid RSM-ML models can: (1) accurately predict Kd across a wide
range of adsorbents and conditions, (2) identify the most influential factors driving adsorption
performance, (3) optimize process parameters to maximize PFAS distribution, and (4) reduce the
need for exhaustive experimentation, saving time and resources.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive RSM-ML framework for modeling and optimizing
the adsorption of PFAS on various adsorbent materials. The specific objectives are to: Investigate
the effects of adsorbent properties, PFAS characteristics, and process conditions on the
distribution coefficient (Kd) using RSM; Implement and compare hybrid RSM-ML algorithms,
including RF, GB, and XGB, to predict Kd and evaluate their performance relative to RSM;
Develop hybrid models to enhance predictive accuracy and capture complex variable

primary source of data was peer-reviewed literature reporting adsorption experiments for PFAS.
These studies included experimental details such as adsorption isotherms, BET surface area, and
equilibrium concentration ranges (Ce). Adsorption isotherms, including widely used models such
as the Freundlich equation (Qe = Kf * Ce1/n), provided the foundation for deriving additional data
points. From the literature, isotherm parameters (Kf, 1/n) were extracted through regression
fitting of experimental data. Using the established isotherm equations, equilibrium
concentrations (Ce) spanning the reported range in each study were substituted to calculate
corresponding Qe values, representing the amount of PFAS adsorbed per unit mass of absorbent.
The calculated Qe values were then used to determine the distribution coefficient (K d), a critical
parameter reflecting the equilibrium partitioning of PFAS between the solid and liquid phases
(Kd = Qe/Ce). This process was repeated systematically to generate synthetic data, ensuring that
each isotherm contributed at least 15 data points within its experimental range. This interpolation
strategy enriched the dataset while maintaining consistency with the original experimental
framework. Table S1 lists studies from which the data was mined for Kd. 2580 data points were
collected from 172 isotherms obtained from more than 30 journal articles published on 73 unique
adsorbents and 10 PFAS compounds (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFHxA, PFBS, PFBA, Gen-X,
PFHpA, PFDA, and PFDoDA) between 2009 and 2025 (Ateia et al., 2018; Campos-Pereira et
al., 2020; Chang et al., 2019, 2020; W. Chen et al., 2017; X. Chen et al., 2011a, 2011b; Deng et

In parallel, the physicochemical properties of PFAS and adsorbent materials were also mined
from the literature. BET surface area (m2/g) data were directly extracted, providing insights into
the adsorbent's structural properties. Additional PFAS molecular properties, including Abraham
solvation parameters (A, B, S, E, V), were computed using the ACD/Labs Percepta platform.
These parameters quantify molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding (A, B),
polarity/polarizability (S, E), and molecular size/volume (V), offering a detailed understanding
of PFAS behavior during adsorption. This comprehensive methodology ensured that the dataset
captured critical variables influencing adsorption processes. By combining experimental
isotherm data with computational descriptors, this study bridges empirical insights and
theoretical modeling. The resulting dataset supports advanced computational techniques, such as
response surface methodology (RSM) and machine learning (ML), for predicting and optimizing
PFAS adsorption across diverse adsorbent materials and environmental conditions.

The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed as a systematic and statistical approach
to model the distribution coefficient (Kd) for PFAS compounds on various adsorbents. RSM
provides a structured framework for identifying the relationships between key independent
variables and the response variable, Kd. The analysis was designed to quantify the linear, non-

linear effects, and interaction effects of the independent variables, enabling a comprehensive
exploration of the multivariable space.

159
160
161
162
163
164

Quadratic and higher-order polynomial (HOP) regression was used for RSM. The independent
variables included pH, adsorbent dose (g/L), temperature (°C), initial concentration (C 0, mg/L),
BET surface area (m²/g), and physicochemical properties of PFAS compounds such as pK a, log
Kow, molecular weight (mg/mmol), and Abraham solvation parameters (A, B, S, E, V). These
variables were selected based on their relevance to adsorption mechanisms and their established
influence on PFAS adsorption.

165
166
167
168
169

The response variable, Kd, was derived from the relationship Kd = Qe/Ce, where Qe represents the
equilibrium adsorption capacity, and Ce is the equilibrium concentration of PFAS in the solution.
Experimental data from the literature and synthetic data generated from isotherm models were
used to populate the data matrix. The quadratic and higher-order polynomial regression RSM
models are given as equations (1) and (2).

To complement the RSM framework and address its limitations in capturing nonlinear and highorder interactions, machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed. The ML models used in
this study included random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting
(XGB), which have demonstrated strong performance in modeling complex environmental
processes. These models were trained to predict Kd based on the same independent variables
used in the RSM analysis. RF is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision
trees during training and averages their predictions to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.
The algorithm's ability to handle multicollinearity and nonlinear relationships makes it
particularly suitable for adsorption studies. GB builds sequential decision trees, with each tree
correcting the errors of its predecessor. This iterative approach enables the model to achieve high
predictive accuracy and uncover intricate relationships within the dataset. XGB, an optimized
implementation of gradient boosting, incorporates advanced features such as regularization to
prevent overfitting and parallel processing to improve computational efficiency. These
characteristics make XGB a powerful tool for high-dimensional adsorption datasets.

Each ML model was trained on 80% of the dataset and validated on the remaining 20% using kfold cross-validation (k = 5) to ensure robustness and minimize overfitting. The performance of

2.4 Hybrid RSM-ML Models

197
198
199
200
201

In this study for hybrid modeling, QRSM and HOP-RSM were combined with RF, GB, and XGB
models to optimize adsorption parameters and predict distribution coefficients (K d). QRSM
incorporates linear, squared, and interaction terms to model adsorption behavior. At the same
time, HOP-RSM extends this framework with higher-degree polynomial terms, allowing for
improved precision in capturing more intricate adsorption interactions.

202

Several hybrid RSM-ML frameworks were employed to improve predictive accuracy:

203
204
205
206

1. Linear Hybrid Model (LHM): This method corrects RSM predictions using ML-based
residual adjustments, enhancing accuracy without sacrificing interpretability. However, it
may struggle with highly nonlinear interactions that cannot be captured by simple residual
corrections.

207
208
209
210

2. RMSE-Based Dynamic Hybrid Model: This approach dynamically selects either the RSM or
ML component based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance, ensuring optimal
prediction for varying adsorption conditions. However, it requires computationally intensive
cross-validation to determine the best model at each instance.

211
212
213
214

3. Multiplicative Hybrid Model: Instead of additive polynomial terms, this model introduces
multiplicative interactions between adsorption parameters, which helps in modeling
synergistic and antagonistic adsorption effects. However, it has a more complex parameter
space, making optimization challenging.

215
216
217
218

4. Metal Model Hybridization: This ensemble-based approach combines multiple ML models
(e.g., GB, XGBoost, Random Forests) with RSM to improve robustness and reduce
overfitting. While it provides high predictive accuracy, it comes with increased
computational cost and complexity in hyperparameter tuning.

221
222
223
224

The predictive accuracy and generalizability of the models were validated using the 20% test
dataset. For hybrid models, the performance was compared against stand-alone RSM and ML
models to assess their ability to capture complex variable interactions and improve prediction
accuracy. Statistical parameters such as R-squared, RSME, MSE, and MAE were used to
compare the prediction accuracy of each model.

225

2.4.2 Surface plots

226

Based on the significance determined from ANOVA analysis, surface plots were generated for
the most significant pair of descriptors for Kd. Surface plots were used to visualize the linear,
non-linear, and interactive effects of the descriptor pair on Kd.

Feature importance analysis was performed for the ML and hybrid models to quantify the
relative contribution of each independent variable to the prediction of K d. For ensemble models
such as RF, GB, and XGB, the feature importance scores were derived from the mean decrease in
impurity (Gini index) or gain, depending on the algorithm. These scores provided valuable
insights into the factors most strongly influencing PFAS adsorption, guiding the development of
targeted remediation strategies. Results for feature importance are showcased in SI with Figure

The response surface methodology (RSM) model using quadratic and higher-order polynomial
(HOP) regression provided a detailed understanding of the relationships between key variables
and the distribution coefficient (Kd) for PFAS adsorption. The HOP regression model captured
linear, non-linear, and interaction effects of the variables, including surface area, pHpzc,
molecular weight, pKa, pH, temperature, log Kow, adsorbent dose, initial concentration, and
Abraham solvation parameters (A, B, S, E, V). The regression coefficients, standard errors (SE),
t-statistics, and p-values were calculated to evaluate the significance and statistical soundness of
each linear, non-linear, and interactive term. However, the significance level of these linear, nonlinear, and interactive terms was found to be different, as shown in Table 1 and Table S2. Table
1 presents the results of a Higher-Order Polynomial Response Surface Methodology (HOPRSM) regression model, which estimates the influence of various physicochemical parameters
on the distribution coefficient (Kd). The coefficients (Estimate) represent the magnitude and
direction of each parameter's effect on Kd, while the standard error (SE), t-statistic (t-Stat), and pvalue (p-value) provide insight into the statistical significance of each predictor.

Among the linear terms, the Surface Area (1.366, p = 0.002) shows a positive and statistically
significant effect on Kd, suggesting that a larger surface area enhances adsorption capacity.
Similarly, pHpzc (302.180, p = 0.031) has a positive effect, indicating that materials with a higher
point of zero charge (pHpzc) tend to favor PFAS adsorption, likely due to stronger electrostatic
interactions. pKa (14.909, p = 0.040) also exhibits a positive and significant influence, implying
that the acid dissociation constant of PFAS compounds plays a key role in their adsorption
behavior. The pH (-1315.724, p = 0.022) term is negative, indicating that increasing pH reduces
Kd, which aligns with expectations since higher pH values can increase electrostatic repulsion
between PFAS and the adsorbent surface.

263
264
265
266
267
268
269

Temperature (403.035, p = 0.041) has a significant positive effect, implying that higher
temperatures might enhance adsorption by increasing diffusion rates or favoring specific
adsorption mechanisms. Log Kow (18.133, p = 0.007) also has a significant impact, confirming that
hydrophobic interactions play a role in PFAS adsorption. However, molecular weight (56.610, p
= 0.891) is not statistically significant, suggesting that molecular size alone does not strongly
influence Kd within the studied range. Besides molecular weight, the other non-significant terms
are given in Table S2 with detailed explanations in supporting information.

273
274
275
276

One limitation of this HOP-RSM model is that it only considers linear relationships between the
predictors and Kd. The absence of non-linear and interaction terms means that the model does not
account for complex adsorption behaviors, such as synergistic or antagonistic effects between
variables. For example, adsorption processes often involve non-linear dependencies on pH and
pKa, yet these effects are not captured in the current model. Additionally, the large standard error
for some parameters (e.g., pKa: 3224.192) suggests possible overfitting or collinearity among
predictors, which could impact the reliability of the estimates.

277
278
279

Overall, while the model provides valuable insights into the primary factors influencing PFAS
adsorption, further analysis incorporating machine learning model to capture non-linearity would
improve predictive accuracy and better describe adsorption mechanisms.

The predicted versus actual Kd plot compared six modeling approaches: HOP-RSM, GB, Linear
HOP-RSM-GB, RMSE-based HOP-RSM-GB, Multiplicative HOP-RSM-GB, and Meta HOPRSM-GB shown in Figure 1 and data for the models is given on Table S3. The distribution of
points around the ideal y = x line revealed distinct differences in predictive accuracy among

The RMSE-based hybrid (RMSE-based HOP-RSM-GB) also demonstrated strong predictive
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.99, RMSE of 488.82, MSE of 238940.5, and MAE of 52.84. While
slightly less accurate than the meta-model, this approach significantly improved over the
individual models by optimizing parameter selection through RMSE minimization. The standalone gradient boosting model (GB) performed well, with an R2 of 1.00, RMSE of 50.12, MSE
of 2511.66, and MAE of 22.81, indicating that GB effectively captured nonlinearity but lacked

larger deviations from the ideal line were particularly pronounced at higher Kd values, suggesting
limitations in capturing complex nonlinear interactions between process conditions and
adsorption. The multiplicative hybrid (Multiplicative HOP-RSM-GB) performed similarly, with
an R2 of 0.53, RMSE of 3106.61, MSE of 9651020.85, and MAE of 205.43, indicating moderate

values and broad scatter indicated the model’s failure to generalize beyond lower adsorption
capacities, a limitation stemming from polynomial regression's sensitivity to multicollinearity
and overfitting in high-dimensional feature spaces. The disparities in model performance

Based on the t-stat and p-value the significant parameters were selected for surface plots to
visualize the interactive effect of these parameters on Kd. Figure 2 illustrates the interactive
effects of surface area (m²/g) and pHpzc on the distribution coefficient (Kd) for PFAS adsorption.
The surface exhibits a curved profile, highlighting the nonlinear relationship between these
variables. Adsorbents with surface areas in the range of 1,000 – 2,000 m2/g demonstrate
increased Kd, when the pHpzc is in the range of 6 – 10, indicating enhanced adsorption
performance due to the greater availability of active binding sites. Similarly, pHpzc plays a
significant role, where Kd increases with pHpzc until it reaches 10. When pHpzc was higher than
10, Kd values showed a decreasing pattern. This trend reflects the ability of adsorbents with
higher pHpzc to maintain a positively charged surface, favoring interactions with negatively
charged PFAS molecules. However, at very high surface areas or extreme pHpzc values, the
adsorption performance plateaus suggest potential saturation effects. The plot underscores the
importance of optimizing both adsorbent surface area and surface charge properties to maximize
PFAS removal efficiency under various environmental conditions.

The surface plot in Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the distribution coefficient (K d,
L/g) and two key predictor variables: Surface Area (m²/g) and pKa using the HOP-RSM XGB
meta-model. The surface shows that Kd reaches its peak at moderate surface areas (~1000–1500
m²/g) and higher pKa values (~0 to 4). This suggests that adsorption efficiency is highest when
the adsorbate has a moderate to high pKa, allowing better interaction with the adsorbent surface.
However, beyond ~1500 m²/g, Kd declines, likely due to pore blockage, diffusion limitations, or
reduced availability of active sites, indicating that excessive surface area does not always
enhance adsorption.

347
348
349
350
351
352
353

The effect of pKa on Kd is also significant. At low pKa values (~ -4 to 0), Kd remains low,
suggesting weaker adsorption due to the adsorbate being in a highly ionized state. As pK a
increases, Ka rises, indicating stronger hydrophobic or π–π interactions. The curvature of the
surface plot highlights the interactive effect of surface area and pK a, suggesting that adsorption
efficiency depends on achieving an optimal balance between these two factors. Simply
increasing surface area does not guarantee higher adsorption, emphasizing the need to optimize
both adsorbent properties and chemical interactions for effective contaminant removal.

Figure 4 depicts the relationship between the distribution coefficient (K d, L/g) and two key
variables: Surface Area (m²/g) and Temperature (°C), modeled using a HOP-RSM XGB metamodel. The plot demonstrates a parabolic trend, where Kd increases with surface area and
temperature up to a certain threshold before gradually decreasing. This indicates that both factors

At moderate surface area (~1000–1500 m²/g) and temperature (~30–40°C), Kd reaches its
maximum, suggesting that an optimal combination of surface properties and thermal conditions
enhances adsorption. However, beyond ~1500 m²/g surface area and above ~40°C, adsorption
efficiency declines, likely due to desorption effects, decreased adsorbate-adsorbent interactions,
or structural changes in the adsorbent material. The surface plot highlights the interactive nature
of surface area and temperature, reinforcing that excessively high temperatures may weaken
adsorption forces, while extreme surface area values may not always improve adsorption due to
diffusion limitations or reduced active site accessibility.

The surface plot in Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between the distribution coefficient (K d,
L/g) and two key chemical parameters: pKa and pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc). Generated
using a HOP-RSM XGB meta-model, the plot highlights the interactive effects of these
parameters on adsorption efficiency. The surface exhibits a nonlinear curvature, indicating that
Kd is maximized at moderate pKa (~0 to 2) and pHpzc values (~6 to 8), suggesting optimal
adsorption conditions when the adsorbate has moderate ionization potential, and the adsorbent
surface charge is near neutrality.

380
381

At low pKa values (~ -4 to 0), Kd remains low, likely due to the adsorbate being predominantly
ionized, which weakens its interaction with the adsorbent. Similarly, at extreme pH pzc values (~2
or ~10–12), Kd declines, possibly due to strong repulsive forces between the adsorbate and
adsorbent surface. The wave-like curvature of the surface plot emphasizes the complex interplay
between electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic adsorption mechanisms, reinforcing the
importance of balancing adsorbate chemistry (pKa) and adsorbent surface charge (pHpzc) for

Figure 6 illustrates the interaction between pHpzc and temperature (°C) on the distribution

both variables significantly influence adsorption performance. Temperature has a positive effect
on Kd, with moderate increases in temperature promoting adsorption, possibly due to enhanced
molecular interactions and increased kinetic energy facilitating PFAS diffusion to adsorption
sites. However, the plot also reveals a saturation effect, where the influence of temperature and

pHpzc plateaus at higher values, suggesting that further increases in these parameters do not yield
proportional improvements in adsorption efficiency. The interaction between temperature and
pHpzc suggests optimal adsorption conditions at moderate temperature levels (around 30 – 35 °C)
and higher pHpzc values. These insights highlight the need for balancing operational parameters
to maximize PFAS removal efficiency under practical environmental conditions.

Figure 7 illustrates the combined effects of pKa and temperature (°C) on the distribution
coefficient (Kd) for PFAS adsorption. The surface demonstrates a nonlinear interaction between
the variables, with both temperature and pKa significantly influencing adsorption performance.
As pKa increases toward neutral or slightly acidic values, Kd also increases, indicating that PFAS
compounds with higher pKa exhibit better adsorption under certain conditions. This may be
attributed to enhanced molecular interactions or ionization effects that improve binding to the
adsorbent surface.

Similarly, higher temperatures positively affect Kd, suggesting that increased thermal energy
facilitates PFAS diffusion and interaction with adsorption sites. The interaction between pK a and
temperature is evident, as their combined influence creates regions of optimal adsorption
efficiency. The highest Kd values are observed at temperatures between 30 – 35 °C and moderate
pKa values (near -1 to 1), indicating a synergistic relationship. Conversely, lower pKa values and
lower temperatures result in reduced adsorption efficiency, as reflected in the lower K a values.
This analysis highlights the importance of carefully optimizing both pKa-related conditions and
operational temperatures to achieve maximum PFAS removal efficiency in adsorption processes.

While the RSM model captured some meaningful trends, its overall predictive performance was
limited. The moderate R2 value of 0.031924 suggests that the model explains a portion of the
variability in Kd, but the high p-values for many terms indicate potential overfitting or
insufficient data diversity. These limitations are likely due to multicollinearity among variables,

the inherently nonlinear nature of PFAS adsorption, and the relatively small dataset size. Despite
these limitations, the RSM analysis provides practical insights into optimizing PFAS adsorption.
The negative impact of pH highlights the importance of maintaining acidic conditions for
effective adsorption, particularly for charged PFAS species. The positive effects of surface area
and pHpzc emphasize the role of adsorbent design in achieving high Kd values. These findings
align with established principles of adsorption science and can guide the development of tailored
remediation strategies.

Figure 8 illustrates the non-linear relationship between Log Kow and surface area, and its
interactive effect on Kd. Low Log Kow resulted in low Kd and high Log Kow resulted in high Kd,
regardless of the surface area. These findings support the idea that PFAS compounds with higher
hydrophobicity will have higher distribution coefficient and removal regardless of the adsorbent
material.

The surface plot in Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between the Kd, pH, and pHpzc, providing
insight into how electrostatic interactions influence PFAS adsorption. The quadratic response
surface model (RSM) results indicate that both pH and pHpzc significantly impact adsorption,
with regression coefficients of -1315.724 for pH and 302.180 for pHpzc, and respective p-values
of 0.022 and 0.031, confirming their statistical significance. The negative coefficient for pH
suggests that increasing pH decreases Kd, which aligns with the expected electrostatic behavior
of PFAS adsorption. At high pH, the adsorbent surface is negatively charged (pH > pHpzc),
leading to electrostatic repulsion with the anionic PFAS species, thereby reducing adsorption
efficiency. Conversely, at low pH, the adsorbent surface carries a positive charge (pH < pHpzc),
promoting electrostatic attraction and enhancing PFAS adsorption. The positive coefficient for
pHpzc indicates that materials with a higher pHpzc exhibit greater Kd, suggesting that high pHpzc

materials are more effective for PFAS adsorption. A higher pHpzc value means the material retains
a positive charge over a wider pH range, reinforcing electrostatic attraction with anionic PFAS.

448

450
451

453

The curvature of the surface plot demonstrates a strong interaction effect between pH and pHpzc.
At low pH and high pHpzc, Kd reaches its maximum, confirming that PFAS adsorption is
optimized under conditions where the adsorbent remains positively charged. However, at high
pH and low pHpzc, Kd becomes highly negative, suggesting a repulsion-dominated desorption
mechanism. The nonlinear adsorption response further highlights the complex interplay between
electrostatic interactions and potential hydrogen bonding at intermediate pH values.

These findings emphasize the critical role of pH control in PFAS adsorption and suggest that
selecting adsorbents with a high pHpzc enhances removal efficiency, particularly under neutral to
slightly acidic conditions. The significant p-values confirm that both pH and pHpzc should be
considered key design parameters in optimizing adsorption materials for PFAS remediation.

3.4 Feature Importance

461

464

466

Below is an example of how one might interpret and discuss the feature‐importance results for
the three models (Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost) in the context of predicting the
PFAS distribution coefficient (Kd) and adsorption behavior. The values shown are the raw
“importance” outputs from each algorithm rather than normalized scores, so direct comparisons
within a single model are typically more meaningful than across models. Nevertheless, looking
at all three can provide insights into which variables tend to be more (or less) influential overall.

467
468
469
470

As shown in Figure 10, for the Random Forest model, surface area (176354.9), Initial
Concentration (145460.2), and pHpzc (114315.3) have notably large importance scores. Surface
Area often correlates strongly with adsorption capacity; a larger surface area typically enhances
the adsorbent’s ability to bind PFAS. Initial Concentration can drive adsorption kinetics and

472
473

equilibrium partitioning—higher initial PFAS levels can lead to greater sorption until saturation
is approached. pHpzc determines the surface charge of many adsorbents; being high here suggests
that shifts in surface charge strongly affect PFAS attraction or repulsion.

474
475
476
477
478

pKa (12889.1), Molecular Weight (9937.0), and Log Kow (9432.5) fall into a middle‐tier
importance. pKa reflects the acidity of PFAS, influencing the ionization state. Molecular Weight
(size of the PFAS compound) may affect diffusion and pore accessibility. Log Kow captures
hydrophobicity and partially predicts how a PFAS might partition onto the solid media versus
water.

479
480
481
482
483

pH (6058.0), E (5381.7), S (5285.3), and Dose (4918.7) occupy a somewhat lower tier but
remain non‐trivial. The solution pH can affect PFAS ionization and adsorbent surface charge.
Dose (g/L) likely matters because the mass of available adsorbent alters the total removal
capacity. E and S (possibly parameters describing molecular structure or solvation) show
moderate importance, suggesting a partial influence on adsorption.

484
485
486
487

B (3676.8), A (3269.5), V (2567.8), and Temperature (229.3) have the smallest importance in
Random Forest. While these features appear less critical, even lower‐ranked variables can still
modulate Kd under certain conditions. Overall, Random Forest strongly underscores surface area,
initial concentration, and pHpzc as top factors in determining PFAS adsorption and distribution.

Initial Concentration (13445.3) and Surface Area (6789.7) dominate the importance in the
Gradient Boost model as shown in Figure 11. Consistent with Random Forest, the amount of
PFAS initially present and the available surface area of the adsorbent are the largest drivers of
the predicted Kd.

494
495
496

Log Kow (19.1), pHpzc (10.5), pKa, and Molecular Weight (8.7) form a secondary importance
cluster. This again indicates that hydrophobicity (Log Kow), ionization tendencies (pHpzc, pKa),
and molecular size all play a role—albeit less crucial than surface area or initial concentration.

497
498
499

Dose (g/L) (7.3), Temperature (5.6), pH (4.7), and S (4.6) follow, showing moderate influence.
Notably, the solution pH remains relevant but at a smaller magnitude than in the Random Forest
result.

500
501
502
503
504

V (1.5), E (0.2), and especially A (0.0), B (0.0) contributed minimally or not at all in Gradient
Boost splits. A zero importance often indicates those variables were never used in the boosted
decision trees (or used so little that they did not improve predictive performance). Thus, Gradient
Boost findings align generally with Random Forest: Initial Concentration and Surface Area stand
out as top features, with some moderate roles for Log Kow, pHpzc, pKa, and Molecular Weight.

505
506

Figure 11: Feature importance plot for Gradient Boost model.

507
508
509

For the XGB model, as shown in Figure 12, Initial Concentration (71252.3) and Surface Area
(33399.1) are again the top factors by a large margin. This reaffirms the strong dependence of Kd
on the dose of PFAS present in solution initially and the available sorption area.

510
511
512

pHpzc (44.2) appears as the third‐highest influencer, followed by pH (23.6) and Dose (15.2). This
suggests that in XGB’s trees, surface charge conditions and the solution pH remain quite
important for adsorption behavior.

513
514
515

Temperature (11.3), Log Kow (11.1), pKa (10.9), S (8.3), and Molecular Weight (5.1) cluster at
moderate levels. V (1.3) again has low influence, and A (0.0), B (0.0), and E (0.0) do not
contribute measurably to improving model performance.

516
517
518

Hence, XGB also confirms the overarching trend that Initial Concentration and Surface Area are
pivotal to predicting Kd, with pHpzc, pH, and other chemical descriptors playing smaller but non‐
negligible roles.

521
522
523
524

All three methods (RF, GB, XGB) highlight Surface Area and Initial PFAS Concentration as top
predictors. In practice, this aligns well with adsorption science: a larger surface area provides
more active sites for PFAS attachment, and the initial PFAS loading drives sorption kinetics,
potentially impacting mass transfer and equilibrium capacity.

525
526
527
528

pHpzc and pH are also significant, especially in Random Forest, implying that surface charge
conditions strongly influence PFAS binding. Molecular descriptors like pK a, Log Kow, and
Molecular Weight provide mid‐range importance, indicating that hydrophobicity, ionization, and
molecular size can further modulate adsorption.

529
530
531
532
533
534
535

Other variables such as Dose, Temperature, S, and E provide lower‐tier effects, and some
features (A, B, E) show zero importance under certain boosting algorithms. All three algorithms
converge on the conclusion that the Surface Area of the adsorbent and the Initial Concentration
of PFAS in solution are critical factors shaping the distribution coefficient (K d). Variables tied to
surface chemistry (pHpzc) and PFAS properties (pKa, Log Kow, molecular weight) further refine
predictions by capturing how electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and size modulate adsorption
behavior.

surface area. This highlighted the importance of PFAS physicochemical properties in
determining adsorption efficiency.
3) Electrostatic interactions, governed by pH and pHpzc, played a critical role in adsorption
efficiency. Adsorption was enhanced at low pH and high pHpzc due to stronger electrostatic
attraction, while high pH led to significant desorption, reinforcing the need for pH control in
remediation strategies.
4) Response surface analysis revealed significant non-linear interactions between adsorption
parameters, indicating that one-variable-at-a-time (OFAT) approaches are insufficient for
optimizing PFAS removal. Instead, data-driven modeling is essential for capturing complex
adsorption behaviors in a multiparameter process.
5) Hybrid models, particularly RMSE-based and meta-model approaches, provided the most
accurate predictions of Kd by effectively integrating polynomial regression with ensemble
learning. This highlighted the value of machine learning in addressing the limitations of
traditional statistical modeling in adsorption studies.
6) Higher-order polynomial (HOP-RSM) regression alone exhibited poor predictive
performance (R² = 0.04), underscoring the necessity of hybrid approaches to accurately
model PFAS adsorption across a wide range of conditions.
7) Surface plots confirmed that adsorption optimization required balancing adsorbent surface
chemistry and operational conditions, with the highest Kd values observed at moderate
surface areas (1000 – 1500 m²/g), pHpzc values (6 – 10), and temperatures (30 – 35 °C).
8) Machine learning hybridization with RSM can significantly reduce the number of
experiments required for process optimization, offering a scalable approach for accelerating
PFAS remediation research and minimizing experimental costs.
9) This study established hybrid RSM-ML modeling as a powerful framework for optimizing
PFAS adsorption, providing a pathway for improved adsorbent design, predictive adsorption
modeling, and data-driven decision-making in environmental remediation efforts.
10) Surface Area and Initial Concentration consistently emerge as the most influential features in
determining the PFAS distribution coefficient (Kd), while pHpzc, pH, and molecular
descriptors (pKa, Log Kow, Molecular Weight) provide additional insights into adsorption
behavior. Across all three algorithms — Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Extreme
Gradient Boost—the data underscore that both adsorbent surface chemistry and PFAS
properties significantly modulate Kd values.
