Abstract

The idea of the origin of life as a complex reaction network spontaneously arising from reactions
of small molecules might be wrong. The results of prebiotic chemistry experiments, where
biologically relevant compounds are formed from simple monomers, such as cyanate, CO2 or
formaldehyde, are usually complex mixtures with only trace amounts of molecules of interest.
Here I take an opposite approach and show that a number of primary metabolites can be derived
from tar-like mixtures by Advanced Reduction Process (ARP). Tars are usually formed from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), are widespread in the Universe and were likely a
source of organic carbon on the early Earth. The conditions thought to exist on the surface
prebiotic Earth, such as sunlight, anoxic sulfur-rich atmosphere and iron-rich dust, lead to the
transformation of naphthalene and other PAH to succinic, lactic, malonic and glycolic acids,
known to be primary metabolites in all living systems. The sum of reaction yields of these
biologically important metabolites goes up to 40%, with individual product yields 1-15%. The
simplicity of this reaction and the ubiquity of PAH on the prebiotic Earth make this process

particularly appealing, as it may have occurred on a very large scale on surfaces of the planet
exposed to sunlight. These findings may point to an overlooked initial step for the origin of life
on Earth, and potentially elsewhere in the Universe.

It is generally assumed that life started from chemical mixtures of simple molecules, and through
a series of geochemical and chemical processes, biology emerged.1 There is an ongoing debate
concerning the initial composition of such mixtures and their similarity to modern metabolome.2–

Miller-Urey experiments opened the field of prebiotic chemistry5 and, for over 70 years,

combinatorial prebiotic reactions have been reported that produce biologically important
molecules from simple precursors, including cyanide,6–9 formamide,10 and others small
molecules.11,12 Potentially the process is widespread in the Universe since irradiation of
astrophysical ice analogues, rich in H2O, CO, CO2, NH3 and CH3OH, grains form multiple
organic molecules, including biologically relevant aldehydes and quinones.13–15 2–4
While this scenario fits well into a human narrative of “things progress from simple to complex”,
it might be far from reality, since relatively little progress in the area has been made since
Butlerov described formose reaction over 160 years ago. Recombination of simple organic
molecules can lead to the formation of enormous chemical diversity.16,17 A natural selection
process might have existed to reduce number of possible molecules to the relatively simple and
conserved set of biologically relevant molecules that we see today.18,19 Suggested selection filters
include water solubility,2 autocatalysis,20 and partition coefficients between early protocells and
the prebiotic “soup” envinroment,21 however, experimental demonstration of any of these

scenarios is still lacking. This work suggests a new pathway for the synthesis of a constrained set
of biologically important molecules.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are a major source of non-biological organic molecules
in the Universe. These compounds constitute the bulk of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and
dust particles in solar system22,23 unlike water soluble organic molecules that are found in ppm to
ppb amounts.24,25 PAH formation predates the formation of Earth26 and PAH were likely the
major source of carbon during the Hadean eon, and their transformation in the early Earth
environment could have been the route to the organic molecules that started life. PAH are
common contaminants, that are removed from atmosphere and waste water via Advanced
Oxidation Process in the presence of oxygen, persulfate and ozone. Reported products of
incomplete oxidation of PAH contaminants include fumaric, malonic, pyruvic, glycolic and
formic acids34 — molecules that are starting material of metabolic networks across all domains
of life . Carboxylic acids, including pyruvic, are major decomposition products of such
processes. While these are biologically relevant target compounds, low oxygen concentration in
the early Earth atmosphere makes this route implausible.
Advanced reduction process (ARP) is used for water purification31 that does not require
molecular oxygen for PAH decomposition. Photolysis of bisulfite (HSO3-) and ferric ions under
mid-range UV irradiation produce highly reactive •OH and •H radicals16,28–30 that lead to
advanced reduction process of PAH.27,32 Environmental conditions on early Earth—high
intensity ultraviolet (UV) light, liquid water, high volcanic activity and iron-rich dust— would
be similar to the conditions used in ARP and could potentially present a natural filter that
reduced number of organic molecules of the prebiotic “soup” to the few relevant one to the
origin of life. Milder oxidation conditions on Earth, due to the absence of oxygen and other
strong oxidants from the atmosphere, could lead to partial oxidation of PAH with carboxylic

acids as end products. To test the hypothesis that iron-sulfur chemistry could lead to the
photolytic formation of biologically relevant molecules, we studied ARP of PAH in anoxic
aqueous solutions of ferric ions and sulfite.
I started with the study of naphthalene, which is a most abundant molecule in PAH
mixtures.35 PAH are poorly soluble in water and likely would have formed a floating layer on the
surface of lakes and oceans. I constructed a microfluidic flow photoreactor to simulate photolysis
of PAH under these conditions. A mercury vapor lamp provided a wide spectrum of UV light
with a maximum at 365 nm, simulating sunlight on the surface of the planet in the absence of an
ozone layer. Flow rate controlled exposure times of the solution to the UV light which varied
from 3 to 30 minutes. Solvent fractions were analyzed by HPLC, GCMS and NMR.
Disappearance of naphthalene was monitored by HPLC. Naphthalene concentrations
dropped to 50% after being exposed to UV light for 3 minutes and disappeared completely after
10 minutes exposure. Only trace amounts of other aromatic molecules were detected by HPLC at
various times during the reaction, disappearing completely after 10 minutes of irradiation.

Exposure of naphthalene to UV light for 1-5 min induced oxidative opening of the
aromatic rings and formation of salicylic, phthalic and mandelic acids. Exposure times longer
than 10 minutes led to the accumulation of several carboxylic acids and trace amounts of other
organic compounds (Figure 1). We observed gas formation in the reactor, which suggests that
part of the naphthalene underwent complete oxidation to CO2. While individual product yields
were relatively modest (1-10%) overall yield of biologically important carboxylic acids (succinic
acid, formic acid, glycolic acid and lactic acid) measured up to 40% of initial naphthalene
concentration (Table 1 and ESI).
In the absence of UV light naphthalene was slowly oxidized (50 % of the compound was
consumed over 72 h). The main products of the “dark” reaction, as detected by 1H NMR, were
2,6-dihydroxybenzoic, formic and glyceric acids. We, however, did not observe succinic acid, or
other biologically relevant carboxylic acids.
For the photolysis of other PAH we started with a turbid suspension of insoluble
molecules in water. After 10 minutes of radiation the solution was transparent with all large
molecules fully oxidized to water soluble compounds. The photolysis of the mixture of PAH
compounds, including pyrene, antracene and other 2 and 3 ring molecules led to the formation of
a greater diversity of products. Concentration of lactic, glycolic and succinic acids were higher
than expected for the yields detected from naphthalene alone, suggesting that acids could be
formed from multiple sources. Interestingly, fumaric and tartaric acids were also detected in
these reactions, which, in addition to succinic acid, may suggest a route for the formation of
other citric acid cycle metabolites (i.e., oxaloacetate and pyruvate).

The use of UV as a source of energy in origin of life experiments is not new, but here it
used it to destroy unnecessary chemical bonds and “clean up” or constrain product diversity.
Previous work by Sutherland, where UV light eventually destroys undesired side products in
nucleotide synthesis,36 suggests, that similar selection rules can be applied for nucleotides.
Our results suggest that under geologically plausible conditions, carboxylic acids might have
been predominant components of the prebiotic “soup.” Previous work by other groups provides
insight into how these compounds might have led to more complex molecules. For instance,
formic acid in the presence of ammonia can be converted to formamide, a starting compound for
the synthesis of nucleotides.37 Lactic acid can be oxidized to pyruvic acid in the presence of
pyrite38 and pyrrhotite39 minerals. Pyruvic acid chemistry and its relevance to the origins of life
has been extensively explored in the literature.40,41 Succinic acid can be transformed to succinic
anhydride and participate in formation of amide bonds42 or thioester formation.43,44Thioester
formation can potentially be the first step in experimental demonstration of “Thioester World”
scenario, proposed by Christian de Duve.21,45,46 Succinic acid is not only a component of the
citric acid cycle but it is an important “hub” chemical that links together several metabolic
pathways in modern cells (Figure 3), including the formation of thioester succinyl CoA,43,44
phosphorylation of GDP, the electron transport chain,47 and in at least three known carbon
fixation pathways (rTCA, 4HB and 3HP pathways).48 Succinic acid seems to be a compound that
was both common on early Earth and central to modern biochemistry and more studies exploring
its roles in first prebiotic networks are needed.

A decomposition of large storage molecules into simpler building blocks and their recombination
into new complex molecules can be seen as proto-catabolism occurring on a planetary scale and
early Earth might have acted as a giant prebiotic chemical reactor.6,49 The prebiotic chemistry
similar to ours might have been common to small rocky planets with sulfate cycles everywhere
in the Universe.
Experimental
FeCl3(>99.9%), Naphthalene ( 99+%), H2SO4 10N were purchased from Aldrich; Na2SO3
(BioUltra, anhydrous, >98.0% ) from Sigma. Carboxylic acids used as standards (glycolic,
malonic, lactic, succinic, phtalic, etc.) were purchased from Aldrich. PAH calibration mixture of
10 µg/mL in acetonytrile of Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, Benz[a]anthracene,
Benzo[a]pyrene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[ghi]perylene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene, Chrysene,
Dibenz[a,h]anthracene, Fluoranthene, Fluorene, Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, Naphthalene,
Phenanthrene, and Pyrene was used for PAH photolysis experiments.
We developed a continuous flow microfluidic photoreactor to study photolysis of Naphthalene .
The reactor had an arc mercury lamp in the center and was surrounded by a quartz jacket. A PFA
tubing with ID of 250 µm was wrapped around the quartz jacket. The total volume of the reactor
was 1.3 mL. All the reactants were pumped through the PFA tubing via a Harvard Instrument
syringe pump. The residence time was adjusted via changing the pumping speed. We used
Hamilton Airtight 10 cc glass syringes in the experiments.
Standard reaction conditions were Naphthalene 0.05 mM pH 4.0, FeCl3 0.5 mM, NaHSO3 10
mM, N2 atmosphere (COY Humidity Control Glovebox). All solutions were prepared from N2
inside the glove box with residual O2 concentration of 0.5-1% and was flushed with N2 for 10
minutes. No attempts to further reduce O2 concentration were made. 10 cc Hamilton Airtight

syringes were filled with reaction mixture. To achieve steady state conditions 2 mL of solution
were pumped through the system at desired speed rate before the collection of the samples were
started.
For HPLC analysis 200 µL aliquots were collected in amber glass vials under N2 atmosphere,
reaction was quenched with 10 µL of MeOH and immediately analyzed by HPLC. Column:
Agilent Poroshell 120 SB-C18 2.7 µm 4.5mm×75 mm; Solvent: A: 0.1% TFA in H2O; B: 0.1%
TFA in ACN; gradient : 5 to 100% B in 8 minutes; detection: UV light 252 nm.
For NMR analysis 6 mL aliquots were collected in amber glass vial under N2 atmosphere,
quenched with MeOH, neutralized to pH 11 with NaOH and lyophilized for 24h. White
precipitate was dissolved in 1mL of D2O, TMS was added as an internal standard to calculate
yields (1mM total proton concentration), solution was centrifuged to remove iron oxide
precipitate and measured by Bruker 600Hz NMR. Peak shifts were compared against the peaks
of internal standards (with pH adjustment).
For GCMS analysis to 200 µL of sample 20 uL of 6M HCl and 200 mg of NaCl ware added,
and extracted with 1 mL of Ethyl Acetate. Extracts were neutralized with Et3N and evaporated
under N2 flow at 50°C. The residue was derivatized with MSTFA reagent (Thermo) for 30
minutes at 50°C (100 µL ACN, 50 µL MSTFA, 10 µL 2,5-dichlorphenol 300 µg/mL as an
internal standard). 1 µL of the prepared solution was injected into Agilent 7890A GC System
with 5975C inert XL MSD with Triple-Axis Detector. Main products were identified by NIST
2014 database search and confirmed against elution times of standard solutions of each molecule.
Yields were calculated from calibration curved from initial amount of naphthalene (in moles).
