Abstract
This short overview summarizes sodium benzoate's (SB) dual role as a useful preservative and a
possible threat to human and environmental health. This review provides a concise summary of
uses, adverse effects, and environmental impact of SB. SB is widely used as a preservative in
pharmaceuticals and food products due to its ability to inhibit microbial growth, thus extending
the shelf life of various formulations, including syrups and ointments. While generally considered
safe, SB can cause allergic reactions and may contribute to conditions like ADHD, particularly in
children. It can also disrupt gut microbiota balance. The paper highlights the concerns regarding
the environmental persistence of SB. Although it is biodegradable, its degradation rate can vary
based on conditions and concentrations. Improper wastewater treatment can lead to its
accumulation in aquatic ecosystems, posing risks to both the environment and human health. The
review emphasizes the need for awareness regarding the long-term effects of sodium benzoate in
ecosystems and suggests that environmentally friendly technologies could mitigate its impact.
Keywords: Sodium benzoate, preservative efficacy, health implications, biodegradation

Introduction
Sodium benzoate (SB) is a preservative that is used a lot in the pharmaceutical industry and other
areas [1]. Due to its ability to prevent microbes from growing, it is often used to make products
last longer like other preservatives [2]. However, SB biodegraded easily [3] and not
environmentally persistent pharmaceutical pollutants (EPPPs), referring to pharmaceuticals that
stay in the environment for a long time [4-6]. Although SB is generally biodegradable, the rate of
degradation is contingent upon the particular circumstances and concentrations present. This
generates concern over the potential adverse impacts on both human beings and ecosystems.
Sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa) is an organic sodium salt derived from benzoic acid, where a
sodium ion replaces a proton from the carboxy group. Additionally, SB is extensively employed
as a preservative in packaged foods and beverages. Some studies suggest potential therapeutic

roles in treating conditions like depression, pain, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders [79].

Figure 1. Chemical structure of sodium benzoate

The main reason SB is commonly employed in the pharmaceutical sector is owing to its effective
preservative and antibacterial characteristics [10, 11]. It efficiently hinders the proliferation of
bacteria, yeast, and fungi [12, 13], which is essential for prolonging the durability of diverse
pharmaceutical items like syrups, ointments, and topical creams [14]. The significance of this rests
in its capacity to uphold the stability and safety of formulations, especially in liquid
pharmaceuticals, by averting contamination and deterioration. In tablet formulations, SB is utilized
as an excipient to augment the solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients, hence enhancing
the medication's bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [15-18].
SB, commonly utilized as a medicinal preservative, studies showed that it has the potential to
induce allergic reactions and perhaps contribute to mental hyperactivity like attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), especially in children [19-22]. Moreover, it has the potential to
disturb the balance of microorganisms in the intestines [23]. Under specific conditions, it
decompose into benzene, a well-established carcinogenic compound [24]. Although SB is usually
deemed safe, those with allergies or special health issues should get advice from a healthcare
practitioner prior to utilizing goods that include this component.
SB's impact on the environment in wastewater can be minimal when the wastewater is not properly
treated [25], due to its toxicity it can contribute to pollution and disrupt aquatic ecosystems if not
managed effectively [26]. Environmentally friendly technology applied to this field can drastically
lower this risk [27].
This mini-review investigates SB in pharmaceutical products, SB is commonly employed
preservative in the fields of pharmaceuticals and food industry. The review examines the uses of
this substance in different formulations and investigates its possible adverse effects and the
potential harm it may do to the environment. The objective of the review is to present an impartial
assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of sodium benzoate, taking into account its effects
on human health as well as its impact on the environment. The study provides valuable insights
into the compound's characteristics, regulatory status, and rising concerns about its long-term
presence in ecosystems by combining existing researches.

Sodium Benzoate Uses, Adverse Effects, and Toxicity
Pharmaceutical companies use SB for many purposes. Mostly used as a preservative in liquid
pharmaceuticals like oral suspensions, its antibacterial qualities ensuring product safety [28, 29].
SB can be utilized as a buffer to regulate the pH of pharmaceutical formulations, hence influencing
the solubility of the products [30].
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies SB as Generally Recognized
as Safe (GRAS) for use in foods, with a maximum limit of 0.1% by weight [31]. SB is commonly
employed as a preservative in pharmaceuticals and medications. However, the precise
concentration limitations of SB can differ based on the exact formulation and kind of medication.
The FDA’s guidance primarily focuses on ensuring the safety of the formulation for its intended
use, despite the criticism that this assessment has overlooked many studies in related cases [32].
The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the FAO (Food and Agriculture
Organization), sets standards for food additives, including SB. According to the latest
recommendation in the ninety-second meeting, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for SB was
established to be up to 20 mg/kg of body weight [33]. Although this ADI has a wide application,
it can also serve as a useful tool for assessing medication safety. The European Medicines Agency
(EMA) provides guidelines for excipients like SB in pharmaceuticals. In the EU, SB is permitted
as a preservative in various pharmaceutical formulations. The concentration of SB in medicines
should comply with safety evaluations, which generally align with the maximum limit of therefore
recommends a maximum dose of 5 mg.kg−1 per day in products, similar to food standards.
However, this limit is not exclusively applicable to pediatric populations [18].
While generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory agencies, sodium benzoate has been
associated with several adverse effects. Some individuals may experience allergic and
hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and asthma-like symptoms [34-37]. Under specific
conditions and in the presence of ascorbic acid, SB can undergo a reaction that produces the wellknown carcinogen benzene. When using medications that contain both substances or those that
contain vitamin C, this reaction becomes much more concerning [38], this reaction is more likely
to occur in acidic environments, such as the stomach. Hyperactivity in children: Some studies have
suggested a link between sodium benzoate consumption and increased hyperactivity in children,
although this association remains controversial [22]. High doses of SB have been shown to induce
oxidative stress in cellular studies, potentially leading to DNA damage [39, 40]. Recent studies
suggest that SB may modify the composition of the gut microbiota, potentially affecting digestive
health [41, 42]. Additionally, some individuals may experience allergic reactions to SB,
manifesting as skin irritation or gastrointestinal discomfort [43]. For individuals with liver disease
or impaired liver function, the metabolism and excretion of SB may be compromised, potentially
leading to adverse effects [44, 45].
Sodium Benzoate Entry to the Environment
SB consumed by humans that utilized in pharmaceuticals and food is disposed of in wastewater.
Wastewater treatment plants typically employ a combination of biological and chemical processes
to remove SB. The primary method is biological treatment, where microorganisms in activated
3

sludge systems break down the compound [46]. These bacteria metabolize SB as a carbon source,
converting it into harmless byproducts like carbon dioxide and water [47, 48]. Advanced oxidation
processes (AOPs), including UV/hydrogen peroxide treatment, ozonation, Fenton's process, and
photocatalysis, can be employed to remove pharmaceutical organic contaminants [49-53], by
generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that oxidize the organic compounds. that employ
oxidative agents to decompose organic contaminants into less toxic ones [54, 55]. When SB makes
it to water treatment facilities, it may be disinfected, but there's still a chance it might result in
disinfection by products (DBP) [56].
Adsorption techniques using activated carbon, in some processes is combined with biological
treatment, can also be effective in removing SB from wastewater [57-59]. In some cases,
membrane filtration systems like nanofiltration or reverse osmosis may be employed to separate
the compound from the water [60, 61]. The selection of treatment procedure often depends on the
concentration of SB and additional pollutants in the effluent.
Contamination of ecosystems is occurring due to the extensive use of preservatives, that containing
organic cyclic substances like SB, in pharmaceutical and food products. Preservatives can enter
aquatic systems through a variety of direct and indirect routes [62]. The main source of water
contamination with organic pharmaceutical pollutants is wastewater that contains residues of these
substances [63, 64]. The influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants were found to
include these preservatives like SB often get into aquatic systems without going through the
normal steps for treating wastewater [65]. There is a significant amount of these pollutants in the
used activated sludge [66]. Biological treatment can get rid of many contaminants, but because
these compounds have complicated molecular structures, it may not be able to fully break them
down [67]. There are also limits to how well chemical cleaning methods can get rid of these
persistent pollutants [68]. Because of this, some of these pharmaceutical residues can end up in
rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, where they could harm aquatic environments and people's
health [69]. The use of clean technology in water treatment has the dual benefit of reducing costs
and environmental harm while simultaneously optimizing process potentials to minimize
pollutants in drinking water [70].
Sodium Benzoate Ecotoxicity
SB may infect aquatic ecosystems via wastewater discharge. Upon entering the environment, it
may present hazards to aquatic organisms due to its capacity to induce toxicity when discharged
into water bodies [71]. The impact is contingent upon elements like concentration, period of
exposure, water quality, and the vulnerability of aquatic organisms [72]. Despite SB is generally
considered to possess low toxicity, its persistent release and buildup may adversely impact aquatic
environments by changing microbial community balance and compromising the health of fish and
invertebrates [73, 74]. Its degradation products, such as benzoic acid, may demonstrate toxicity to
fish and other aquatic creatures, affecting their development, reproduction, and survival [75].
Furthermore, SB can facilitate eutrophication, a source of carbon, a phenomenon marked by
excessive nutrient enrichment that results in subsequent detriment to aquatic bacteria and
organisms [76, 77]. The ecotoxicological consequences of SB may differ, nevertheless it is

essential to adopt efficient management techniques to reduce its release and investigate alternative
preservatives to protect aquatic ecosystems.
SB like other untreated contaminants poses significant risks to aquatic life when it contaminates
surface and ground waters [78]. Studies have demonstrated its toxicity to various aquatic
organisms, including fish [79]. Exposure to SB may result in acute toxicity, leading to mortality
or sub-lethal consequences, including diminished growth rates, compromised reproduction, and
behavioral anomalies [80-83]. Extended exposure may lead to lasting consequences, including
biodegradation in aquatic ecosystems and modifications of ecological processes. While SB itself
is biodegradable, its still or its breakdown products can have harmful effects on aquatic organisms
and plants [26, 84]. Moreover, SB can engage with other water pollutants, intensifying their
hazardous effects. The presence of SB in aquatic habitats can profoundly affect the health of
aquatic ecosystems and its resident organisms.
Conclusion
Sodium benzoate (SB) is recognized for its effectiveness as a preservative in pharmaceuticals,
helping to prevent microbial growth and extend product shelf life. This characteristic is crucial for
maintaining the stability and safety of liquid formulations like syrups and creams. Despite its
benefits, SB has been linked to potential adverse health effects, including allergic reactions and
possible contributions to ADHD in children. It may also disrupt the balance of gut microbiota,
raising concerns about its long-term safety for consumers. The review highlights that while SB is
generally biodegradable, its degradation can be influenced by environmental conditions. If
wastewater containing SB is not properly treated, it can lead to pollution and disrupt aquatic
ecosystems, emphasizing the need for effective management strategies. The study proposes the
development of eco-friendly technology to lessen the impact of SB and seeks for additional
thorough research to determine its long-term effects on individuals and the environment.
