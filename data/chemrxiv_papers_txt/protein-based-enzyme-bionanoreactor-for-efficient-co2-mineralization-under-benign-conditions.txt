Abstract

16

Mineralization is an emerging approach for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), but current

17

methods rely on high pH conditions to overcome the kinetic and thermodynamic barriers of CO2 reacting

18

with metal cations to form carbonate minerals. This is often achieved through adding alkaline chemicals or

19

using electrochemical catalysis, which are resource-intensive, environmentally disruptive, and require

20

extensive pH adjustments. Inspired by natural biomineralization, this study presents a novel enzyme

21

bionanoreactor approach based on self-assembling lumazine synthase AaLS-13 protein nanocages to

22

facilitate efficient CO2 mineralization under mild conditions. The AaLS-13 nanocage actively encapsulates

23

and concentrates metal cations within its cavity, with its assembled structure playing a critical role in

24

enhancing the cation availability for subsequent reactions. By encapsulating carbonic anhydrase into the

25

nanocages, the resultant bionanoreactors integrate CA catalysis with metal cation concentration, showing

26

significantly improved catalytic performance. They efficiently convert dissolved CO2 into carbonate

27

minerals as well as capture and mineralize atmospheric CO2 under benign, ambient conditions. This

28

research lays the groundwork for developing AaLS-13 nanocage-based bionanoreactors for sustainable

29

carbon mineralization, offering an eco-friendly CCS alternative. It also provides new insights into

30

leveraging AaLS-13 nanocage-substrate interactions to modulate local microenvironments and optimize

31

enzyme catalysis for diverse nanotechnological, biomedical, and environmental applications.

1. Introduction

33

The rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) are a major driver of global climate change,

34

prompting urgent efforts to develop effective carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) solutions.[1] Among

35

them, mineralization, which converts CO2 to stable, solid carbonate minerals, is gaining increased attention

36

for its ability to provide permanent carbon storage.[2,3,4] This approach involves reacting dissolved CO₂ with

37

mineral cations like magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+) to form carbonate minerals.[5,6] These cations

38

can be obtained from various sources such as mining effluent, paper recycling wastewater, and hydraulic

39

fracturing wastewater.[7,8] Seawater presents another promising source, containing approximately 10 mM

40

Ca2+ and 40 mM Mg2+.[9] With its vast volume, seawater-based mineralization offers a potential pathway

41

for gigatonne-scale CO2 management.[10] However, the hydration of dissolved CO2 (CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3)

42

is exceedingly slow, with a second-order reaction rate constant of 6 × 10-4 M-1 s-1 at neutral pH, which

43

represents a major bottleneck in the carbon mineralization process by limiting the availability of carbonate

44

species.[11] In addition, at benign pH, the large majority of carbonate species remain in the form of

45

bicarbonate (HCO3-), resulting in a low concentration of carbonate ions (CO32-) and further impeding the

46

formation of carbonate minerals. To overcome these limitations, current carbon mineralization systems

47

often use high pH conditions (>10), by either adding alkaline chemicals directly or generating hydroxide

48

ions in situ through electrochemical catalysis.[12,13] While these methods accelerate CO2 hydration and

49

increase CO32- concentration, they are chemical- or energy-intensive, require pH readjustments, and can

50

disrupt aquatic ecosystems, which pose significant drawbacks for economic viability, large-scale

51

applications, and long-term sustainability.[14,15,16]

52

The mineralization of CO2 is indeed a common process in the biosphere, known as carbon

53

biomineralization, where living organisms convert CO2 into solid carbonate minerals and deposit them

54

within biological structures such as shells and exoskeletons.[17] Biochemical studies have identified a variety

55

of biomolecules – including enzymes, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids – that play crucial roles in

56

facilitating carbon biomineralization.[2,18,19] These biomolecules contribute synergistically in two main

57

ways: by catalyzing the hydration of CO₂ and by concentrating mineral cations, thus enabling the efficient

58

precipitation of carbonate minerals even under benign ambient conditions. One of the key players is

59

carbonic anhydrase (CA), a group of metalloenzymes that catalyze the interconversion between dissolved

60

CO2 and bicarbonate.[20,21] As one of the most efficient enzymes known, CA accelerates the CO2-water

61

reaction with a rate constant of 106 M-1 s-1 at neutral pH, approximately 109 faster than the uncatalyzed

62

reaction.[22] This high catalytic activity makes CA broadly used in carbon biomineralization to bypass the

63

rate-limiting CO2 hydration step. In addition to CA, biomolecules with abundant acidic functional groups

64

(e.g., carboxyl groups) play a vital role in concentrating metal cations through electrostatic

65

interactions.[23,24,25] They create localized microenvironments with significantly elevated levels of metal

66

cations, which facilitates the formation of carbonate mineral precipitates even at low concentrations of

67

carbonate ions (CO32-) under benign pH conditions.

68

Drawing inspiration from these natural carbon biomineralization mechanisms, this study aims to

69

develop a biomimetic approach for sustainable carbon mineralization, by engineering microenvironments

70

that integrate CA catalysis with metal cation concentration. Lumazine synthase from Aquifex aeolicus

71

(AaLS) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of riboflavin.[26] Beyond its enzymatic role, AaLS is

72

known to self-assemble into highly structured, hollow, porous protein nanocages, consisting of 60 identical

73

AaLS protein subunits, with a diameter of 16 nm.[27] An engineered variant of AaLS, termed AaLS-13, has

74

been developed by introducing 11 specific amino acid mutations – four of which involve amino acids with

75

acidic side chains located on the inner surface of the nanocage.[28] This engineered variant self-assembles

76

into a 39 nm-wide spherical nanocage with an internal cavity of approximately 15,600 nm3.[29] More

77

importantly, these mutations impart a high density of clustered negative charges on the inner surface of the

78

AaLS-13 nanocage, enabling it to effectively uptake and encapsulate positively charged molecules through

79

electrostatic interactions.[30,31] Leveraging this property, a tagging strategy has been developed to

80

encapsulate target enzyme cargos within the AaLS-13 nanocages. By fusing the enzyme with a cationic

81

protein tag, the tag acts as a "zip code", directing the enzyme into the nanocage and anchoring it to the inner

82

surface with the molecule oriented toward the center of the cavity.[32] Various enzymes such as proteases,

83

retro-aldolase, β-lactamase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase have been successfully encapsulated into AaLS4

84

13 nanocages by cationic tag fusion.[33,34] These unique properties make the AaLS-13 nanocage a promising

85

platform for mimicking the natural carbon biomineralization process. The nanocage’s potential to

86

encapsulate CA, combined with the possible capability to uptake and concentrate cationic molecules within

87

its cavity, could offer a synergistic and integrated system for CA catalysis and metal cation concentration.

88

However, despite this promise, previous AaLS-13 studies have primarily focused on encapsulating highly

89

positively charged biomolecules, with little known about the encapsulation of small, low positively charged

90

cations.[27,32,35,36] Furthermore, while earlier research has explored AaLS-13’s interactions with charged

91

molecules to manipulate their concentrations within the nanocage and tune the catalysis of encapsulated

92

enzymes, it has centered on direct substrates for the encapsulated enzymes.[33,37,38] This differs

93

fundamentally from the proposed carbon mineralization application, where the product from the

94

encapsulated enzyme (CO32-) reacts with an indirect substrate (metal cation) within the nanocage,

95

presenting a novel avenue that requires further exploration.

96

Here, we report on the development of an AaLS-13-based bionanoreactor designed to mimic

97

natural carbon biomineralization processes for sustainable and efficient mineralization of CO2. We

98

systematically evaluate the encapsulation of metal cations in AaLS-13 protein nanocages and highlight the

99

critical role of nanocage’s assembled structure in facilitating metal cation interactions, thereby enhancing

100

their availability for subsequent reactions. Using a new polypeptide tagging approach, we encapsulate CA

101

into AaLS-13 nanocages and construct AaLS-13-encapsulated CA bionanoreactors that integrate CA

102

catalysis with metal cation concentration to replicate natural carbon biomineralization mechanisms. We

103

demonstrate that the bionanoreactors efficiently convert dissolved CO2 into carbonate minerals under near-

104

neutral pH conditions and capture and mineralize atmospheric CO2 in the presence of environmentally

105

relevant levels of metal cations, achieving significantly improved catalytic performance compared to

106

unencapsulated CA enzyme. This work lays the foundation for developing and applying AaLS-13-based

107

bionanoreactors for sustainable carbon mineralization, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to

108

conventional CCS methods. It also provides new insights into harnessing protein nanocage-substrate

109

interactions to modulate local microenvironments and optimize biochemical reactions, paving the way for

2. Results and Discussion

114

2.1 AaLS-13 Protein Nanocage Production and Characterization

115

The AaLS-13 protein was expressed cytoplasmically in Escherichia coli and purified from lysed

116

cells using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity resins. The successful production and assembly of

117

purified AaLS-13 protein nanocages were confirmed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel

118

electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses (Figure 1a & 1b). SDS-PAGE

119

results showed a prominent band corresponding to the ~17 kDa AaLS-13 protein in both the soluble fraction

120

post-cell lysis and the Ni-NTA purified eluate, consistent with the expected molecular weight of the AaLS-

121

13 monomer (16.86 kDa) as calculated from its amino acid sequence.[28] DLS measurements revealed a

122

dominant peak at hydrodynamic diameters of approximately 50 nm (Figure 1b),[39] supporting successful

123

nanocage assembly. To further validate the morphology of the obtained AaLS-13 nanocages, negative-stain

124

transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed, which revealed relatively uniform spherical

125

particles with average outer diameters of 42.3 ± 4.5 nm (Figure 1c & S1a,b). Taken together, the protein

126

size, particle size distribution, and morphology of the produced AaLS-13 nanocages aligned well with the

127

structures reported in previous studies,[29,31] indicating successful expression and assembly of the

128

nanocages.

2.2 Metal Cation Encapsulation and Concentration

139

To investigate the cation encapsulation capabilities of the assembled AaLS-13 protein nanocages,

140

we conducted an incubation study using Mg2+ ions. Magnesium was selected due to its abundant availability

141

in natural water bodies, especially seawater, making it not only easily accessible but also a low-cost option

142

for large-scale applications.[10] Additionally, Mg²⁺ readily interacts with dissolved inorganic carbon species

143

to form stable magnesium carbonate, which is a crucial step in carbon sequestration processes.[40] These

144

properties make Mg²⁺ an ideal candidate for exploring the potential of AaLS-13 protein nanocages in

145

biomimetic carbon mineralization. Following incubation, free Mg2+ ions were separated from those

146

associated with the protein nanocages using spin desalting columns filled with size-exclusion gels. The gels

147

contain pores that are small enough to trap molecules smaller than 6 kDa, allowing free Mg2+ ions to enter

148

the gel pores while the AaLS-13-associated Mg2+ ions are eluted with the nanocages during centrifugation

149

(Figure 2a). The Mg2+ concentration in the eluate was then quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma

150

Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Figure 2b shows that in the presence of AaLS-13 nanocages,

151

the Mg2+ concentration in the column eluate reached around 75 µM, while the protein free control exhibited

152

only a negligible amount of Mg2+. This contrast clearly indicates that the AaLS-13 nanocages are capable

153

of effectively taking up Mg2+ ions. When normalized to the AaLS-13 protein concentration, the amount of

154

associated Mg2+ equates to about 70 µmol per gram of AaLS-13 protein, corresponding to approximately

155

424 Mg2+ ions per AaLS-13 nanocage.

within AaLS-13 nanocages was collected in the flow-through after centrifugation and then quantified by

curve fits well with the Langmuir isotherm. Error bars represent the standard deviations of three
independent experiments. (e) Mg2+ concentration in the eluate after incubating with AaLS-13 nanocages

encapsulation within AaLS-13. The Mg²⁺ concentration in the eluate peaked at a NaCl concentration of 0.1
mM; however, as the NaCl concentration increased or decreased beyond this point, a reduction in Mg²⁺
concentration in the eluate was observed. Error bars represent the standard deviations of three independent
experiments. (g) Comparison of Mg2+ interactions with AaLS-13, lysozyme (positively charged at neutral
pH), and BSA (negatively charged at neutral pH). Both lysozyme and BSA exhibited significantly lower
interactions with Mg2+ compared to AaLS-13 nanocages. Error bars represent the standard deviations of
three independent experiments.

181

A previous study investigating the interaction between metal cations and ferritin, a protein

182

nanocage with a negatively charged inner surface similar to AaLS-13 but smaller size, revealed that ferritin-

183

associated metal could localize either on the outer surface or within the interior cavity, depending on the

184

metal species.[41] The key distinction between these interactions lies in stoichiometric binding. Outer surface

185

binding relies on a limited number of specific sites forming coordination bonds with metal cations, resulting

186

in a low stoichiometric of fewer than ten metal cations per ferritin nanocage. In contrast, the interior cavity's

187

interaction with metal ions primarily occurs through electrostatic interactions, allowing for a significantly

188

higher stoichiometric binding, with tens of metal ions per ferritin nanocage. Therefore, given that each

189

AaLS-13 nanocage can take up hundreds of Mg2+ ions, we reason that these ions are encapsulated within

190

the nanocage’s cavity, like many other cationic molecules.[32,33,34,42] Assuming the encapsulated Mg2+ ions

191

are uniformly distributed within the cavity, the estimated average concentration of Mg2+ inside the

192

nanocages is 45 mM – an enrichment factor of 22.5 times relative to the initial concentration in solution.

193

This finding suggests that AaLS-13 nanocage encapsulation significantly concentrates Mg2+ ions within its

194

cavity.

195

As the concentration of AaLS in the incubation mixture increased, the level of Mg2+ in the eluate

196

correspondingly rose (Figure 2c). We then varied the initial concentration of Mg2+ from 0 to 2000 µM while

197

maintaining a constant AaLS-13 concentration of 2.4 mg/mL to investigate the isotherm of Mg2+

198

encapsulation in AaLS-13 nanocages. As shown in Figure 2d, the encapsulation data fit well with the

199

Langmuir isotherm, yielding a Langmuir affinity constant of 6.23 ´ 103 M-1 and a maximum encapsulation

200

capacity of 70 µmol Mg2+ per gram of AaLS-13 protein. This affinity constant and maximum capacity are

201

comparable to, if not better than, those of many other metal ion sorbents such as activated carbon, zeolites,

202

and silica-based sorbents.[43,44,45] Moreover, the encapsulation process reached equilibrium within seconds

203

(Figure 2e), with Mg2+ ions remaining bound within AaLS-13 nanocages for hours to days. This rapid

204

equilibrium contrasts with other proteins used in metal adsorption, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA),

205

where equilibrium typically requires several hours of incubation.[46]

206

Ionic strength was also found to significantly influence Mg2+ encapsulation. At a NaCl

207

concentration of 0.1 M, the Mg2+ concentration in the eluate peaked, indicating the most efficient

208

encapsulation at this ionic strength (Figure 2f). As the NaCl concentration increased, a decline in Mg²⁺

209

concentration in the eluate was observed, suggesting that higher ionic strength reduced encapsulation

210

efficiency. This effect could be due to the electrostatic shielding caused by increased ionic strength,[47,48]

211

which inhibits interactions between the cations and the negatively charged inner surface of the nanocages.

212

Interestingly, when the NaCl concentration decreased from 0.1 M to 0 M, the Mg²⁺ concentration in the

213

eluate also dropped, despite the lower ionic strength. This unusual phenomenon is possibly related to the

214

structural properties of AaLS-13 nanocages. Previous studies have shown that the assembly of AaLS-13

215

nanocages is sensitive to salt concentration, with fully intact assemblies maintained at NaCl concentrations

216

of >= 150 mM, and partial disassembly occurring at lower salt concentrations.[27] Thus, at 0 M NaCl, the

217

AaLS-13 nanocages likely partially disassembled, weakening their interactions with Mg2+ ions and

218

reducing the efficiency of Mg2+ encapsulation. This observation underscores the critical importance of

219

nanocage structural integrity in effective metal cation encapsulation.

220

To further confirm the role of the AaLS-13 nanocage structure in its Mg2+ encapsulation capability,

221

we conducted additional adsorption experiments using two other proteins: lysozyme and BSA. Lysozyme,

222

a positively charged protein at neutral pH (~7.4) with an approximate charge of +7.2 per protein (Figure

223

S2b), showed minimal interaction with Mg²⁺ ions, as evidenced by the lack of increase in Mg²⁺

224

concentration in the eluate (Figure 2g). This result is not surprising due to the electrostatic repulsion

225

between the similarly charged lysozyme and Mg²⁺ ions. In contrast, BSA, which carries a similar net

226

negative charge as the AaLS-13 protein monomer at neutral pH (Figure S2a & c) and would theoretically

227

attract Mg²⁺ cations, only slightly increased the Mg2+ concentration in the eluate to 6 µM, 13 folds lower

228

than those achieved with AaLS-13 nanocages. This significant difference underscores the crucial role of

229

the assembled nanocage structure of AaLS-13 in enhancing its interaction with Mg²⁺ ions. Sasaki et al.

230

calculated the electrostatic surface potential of an AaLS-13 pentamer, revealing that the majority of its

231

negative charge is concentrated on the inner surface.[31] The assembly of the AaLS-13 nanocage thus creates

232

a highly clustered array of negative charges, which leads to stronger electrostatic attraction and facilitates

233

the effective encapsulation of positively charged Mg2+ ions within the nanocages. This enhancement of

234

electrostatic interactions is consistent with the findings of Zhou and Pang, who demonstrated that

235

clustering-like charges on a protein surface generate strong local electric fields, thereby improving the

236

binding affinity for oppositely charged ions and molecules.[49] Similarly, the study by Sheinerman and

237

Honig showed that clustered charges at protein-protein interfaces create strong electrostatic fields, which

238

promote interaction by attracting oppositely charged residues on interacting molecules.[50]

239
240

2.3 Encapsulation of CA

241

Building on the effective charge-based interactions between AaLS-13 and Mg2+, we proceeded to

242

construct the enzyme-protein nanocage bionanoreactors by encapsulating CA from Neisseria gonorrhoeae

243

(ngCA) – one of the fastest CAs known – within AaLS-13 nanocages.[51] To facilitate interaction with the

244

negatively charged inner surface of AaLS-13, the ngCA enzyme was fused with a polycationic R5 peptide.

245

While previous studies have successfully encapsulated a variety of enzymes within AaLS-13 by attaching

246

them with a supercharged GFP(+36) tag,[27,29,52] we found that this tag caused low elution yields of ngCA

247

from the Ni-NTA column. This is likely due to the large size of GFP(+36) (~27.5 kDa), which may interfere

248

with the folding of the tagged ngCA or its interaction with the Ni-NTA resin. Thereby, we considered the

249

polycationic R5 peptide as a more suitable alternative, due to its significantly smaller size (~2.5 kDa). The

250

R5 tag is derived from silaffins, a class of proteins that play crucial roles in forming silica cell walls in

251

diatoms. Specifically, R5 corresponds to a repeat unit within silaffins that effectively catalyzes the

252

polymerization of negatively charged silica precursors through electrostatic interactions.[53]

253

The successful production and purification of R5-tagged ngCA (ngCA-R5) were confirmed by

254

SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 3a), where the fused protein appeared as a distinct band at approximately 25

255

kDa, consistent with its predicted molecular weight based on the amino acid sequence.[54] Subsequently,

256

the purified ngCA-R5 was incubated overnight with pre-purified AaLS-13 nanocages at room temperature

257

to facilitate encapsulation (Figure 3b), and the mixture was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography

258

(SEC) fractionation to separate free and AaLS-13-encapsulated ngCA-R5. As shown in Figure 3c, the

259

AaLS-13 nanocage, due to its large size, eluted early with a sharp peak around 9 mL, while unencapsulated

260

ngCA-R5 eluted in a broader peak between 17 and 22 mL. When the encapsulation mixture was loaded

261

onto the SEC column, the elution profile revealed two distinct peaks: a sharp peak for AaLS-13 nanocages

262

and a broad peak for unencapsulated ngCA-R5. Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis of the AaLS-13 elution

263

fraction revealed two bands corresponding to the protein size of AaLS-13 and ngCA-R5 (Figure 3a, lane

264

3), indicating successful encapsulation of ngCA-R5 within AaLS-13 nanocages. To further validate this,

265

we assessed the CA activity of the AaLS-13 fraction using p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) and phenol red

266

assays. The pNPA assay measures the enzyme's ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of pNPA to p-nitrophenol,

267

a yellow product that absorbs strongly at 405 nm.[55] As shown in Figure 3d, the AaLS-13 fraction

268

significantly promoted the absorbance increase at 405 nm, suggesting the presence of active ngCA-R5.

269

Likewise, the phenol red assay, which tracks the pH shift resulting from the conversion of dissolved CO₂

270

to bicarbonate, also confirmed the presence of active CA by the observed accelerated decrease in

271

absorbance at 560 nm (Figure S3a & b). Collectively, these results demonstrated that the R5 tag effectively

272

directs the encapsulation of ngCA into AaLS-13, and more importantly, that the AaLS-13-encapsulated

273

enzyme remained catalytically active, which is crucial for the subsequent studies on using the enzyme-

274

protein nanocage bionanoreactors for carbon sequestration.

performed under the same experimental conditions but without CA-LS.

2.4 Bionanoreactor for CO2 Mineralization

293

We next evaluated the efficacy of the AaLS-13 nanocages encapsulating ngCA-R5 (CA-LS) as

294

bionanoreactors for catalyzing the direct mineralization of dissolved CO₂ with Mg²⁺ ions. The purified CA-

295

LS bionanoreactors were incubated with 1 mM MgCl2 and 5.6 mM CO2 in a pH 8.0 buffer at room

296

temperature with continuous shaking. After overnight incubation, the mixture turned cloudy with the

297

formation of white precipitate particles. Centrifugation resulted in a substantial white pellet at the bottom

298

of the tube (Figure 4a), which was dried and subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to confirm the

299

identity of the precipitate and determine its crystalline phases (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 4c, the XRD

300

pattern displayed three sharp peaks at 2θ values of 32.5°, 42.9°, and 54.2°, which correspond to the

301

characteristic peaks of anhydrous MgCO3,[56] confirming the mineralization of dissolved CO2 into

302

crystalline MgCO3 under the catalysis of CA-LS bionanoreactors. The absence of peaks corresponding to

303

other Mg-containing phases such as Mg(OH)2 suggests a high selectivity of the bionanoreactors for MgCO3

304

formation. In contrast, a control experiment using only AaLS-13 without CA (LS only) remained clear at

305

the end of incubation and produced negligible pellets after centrifugation (Figure 4a). This result was

306

expected as the hydration of dissolved CO2 at pH 8.0 is slow, limiting the availability of carbonate ions and

307

preventing the formation of MgCO3 precipitates. However, interestingly, when a mixture of CA (not fused

308

to R5) and AaLS-13 was tested (unencapsulated CA/LS), the solution stayed clear after overnight

309

incubation, and only a minimal pellet was obtained (Figure 4a).

310

To quantitatively determine and compare the amount of MgCO3 formed, we dissolved the collected

311

pellets in nitric acid and measured the Mg2+ concentrations using ICP-OES. Figure 4d shows the time-

312

dependent formation of MgCO₃ precipitates for the bionanoreactor experimental group and two control

313

groups. After two hours of reaction, CA-LS nanoreactors produced 0.02 μmol of MgCO3 per mL reaction

314

mixture, corresponding to the mineralization of 0.02 μmol CO2, which is 6 times higher than the amount

315

achieved by the LS only and unencapsulated CA/LS controls. As the reaction progressed, the production of

316

MgCO3 increased across all three groups, albeit at different rates. From 6 to 15h, the CA-LS

317

bionanoreactors exhibited a significant growth of MgCO3 precipitation, ultimately reaching 0.2 μmol,

318

equivalent to 0.2 μmol CO2 captured per mL mixture. This rate is approximately 5 times higher than that

319

observed in two control groups.

bionanoreactors demonstrated significantly faster and more efficient CO2 mineralization, as indicated by
the formation of MgCO3, compared to both the unencapsulated CA/LS and LS only controls. The MgCO3
formation was quantified based on Mg2+ amounts in the precipitate, calculated at a 1:1 molar ratio. Error
bars represent the standard deviations of three independent experiments. (e) Schematic illustration of
synergistic CO2 hydration and mineralization reactions within the CA-LS bionanoreactors. Dissolved CO₂
enters the CA-LS nanocage, where encapsulated ngCA-R5 catalyzes its conversion to carbonate species.
These carbonate species then react with Mg²⁺ ions, which are locally concentrated through electrostatic
interactions with the negatively charged inner surface of AaLS-13 nanocages, leading to the accelerated
formation of MgCO₃ precipitates.

337

These findings indicate that simply mixing unencapsulated CA with AaLS-13 nanocages has only

338

a limited effect on carbon mineralization with Mg2+, underscoring the importance of CA encapsulation

339

within AaLS-13 for efficient MgCO₃ precipitation. In a pH 8 buffer, although unencapsulated CA can

340

catalyze the hydration of CO2, only 0.46% of the hydrated CO2 stays in the CO32- form, with the majority

341

being bicarbonate, according to the carbonate equilibria. This low level of carbonate ions resulted in a small

342

reaction quotient of the carbon mineralization reaction (CO32- + Mg2+ -> MgCO3), making MgCO₃

343

precipitation less favorable. The superior performance of the CA-LS bionanoreactor can be attributed to

344

the synergy between AaLS-13 and encapsulated ngCA-R5, likely creating a specific microenvironment that

345

facilitated the formation of MgCO3. As illustrated in Figure 4e, the uptake of Mg2+ by the AaLS-13

346

nanocage increases the local Mg2+ concentration within the cavity, while simultaneously, the encapsulated

347

ngCA-R5 catalyzes the hydration of dissolved CO2 to produce carbonate species. This could lead to an

348

overlap of “hotspots” for Mg2+ and carbonate ions within the nanocage, thereby enhancing the formation

349

of MgCO3 precipitates and the mineralization of CO2. In addition, this synergy provides an additional piece

350

of evidence supporting the successful encapsulation of ngCA-R5 into AaLS-13 nanocages.

351

The ability of the CA-LS bionanoreactor to effectively facilitate carbon mineralization with Mg2+

352

at near-neutral pH is particularly noteworthy. Most existing methods often require a high pH (>10) to

353

overcome the kinetic and thermodynamic constraints of CO₂ hydration and mineralization reactions,[57]

354

typically relying on alkaline chemicals or electrochemical catalysis, which not only consume significant

355

amounts of chemicals or energy but can also have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems.[58] In contrast, the

356

CA-LS bionanoreactor emulates natural carbon biomineralization processes by combining metal ion

357

concentration with biocatalytic CO₂ hydration. This integration allows effective carbon mineralization at a

358

near-neutral pH of 8.0, providing a more eco-friendly and efficient solution for sustainable carbon

359

sequestration.

361

2.5 Direct CO2 Capture from Ambient Air

362

DAC is an increasingly vital technology in the combat against climate change, drawing significant

363

attention as a key method for reducing atmospheric CO2 levels.[59] Unlike traditional carbon capture

364

approaches that focus on concentrated sources, DAC targets CO2 directly from the ambient air, thus

365

complementing existing mitigation strategies and contributing to long-term net-zero goals.[60] In light of

366

this significance, we then evaluated the performance of our CA-LS bionanoreactor in the context of DAC,

367

aiming to assess its effectiveness in this emerging and crucial area of carbon management. As depicted in

368

Figure 5a, we mixed CA-LS bionanoreactors with 40 mM MgCl2 in a pH 8.0 buffer within glass vials with

369

a loose cap to facilitate CO2 transfer from the air. The 40 mM Mg2+ concentration was selected to reflect

370

levels commonly found in natural water bodies, such as seawater and groundwater, which are potential

371

cost-effective sources of Mg2+ for large-scale DAC applications.[9,61] Three controls containing only ngCA-

372

R5, only AaLS-13 nanocages (LS only), and neither ngCA-R5 nor AaLS-13 (protein free) were also

373

prepared similarly. At time zero, the CA-LS and LS only groups exhibited a milky appearance due to the

374

presence of the assembled nanocages, while the ngCA-R5 only and protein free control groups remained

375

crystal clear. After 24h of incubation, cloudiness first appeared in the CA-LS group due to the formation of

376

white precipitate particles, with no significant changes observed in the other groups. By 48h, the cloudiness

377

in the CA-LS group had intensified, and the ngCA-R5 only group began to show slight cloudiness. In

378

contrast, the LS only and protein free groups showed no visible changes (Figure 5b). ICP-OES analysis of

379

the pellets collected after centrifugation confirmed that the CA-LS bionanoreactor significantly

380

outperformed the three control groups, producing approximately 0.03 μmol of MgCO3 (equivalent to 0.03

381

μmol CO2 mineralized) per mL mixture, which was 4 times higher than the ngCA-R5 only group and 24

382

times higher than the LS only group at the 24h mark (Figure 5c). The protein free control did not generate

383

any detectable MgCO3 precipitation.

groups upon air exposure over time, demonstrating the significantly higher efficiency of CA-LS
bionanoreactors in capturing and mineralizing atmospheric CO2. Error bars represent the standard
deviations of three independent experiments.

396

The CA-LS bionanoreactor’s capacity to capture CO₂ directly from the air presents substantial

397

opportunities for integrating this technology into DAC systems. While biomimetic carbon mineralization

398

with CA has been widely studied, most research has focused on concentrated CO₂ sources or post-

399

combustion gases rather than ambient atmospheric CO₂.[62,63] This focus is largely due to the low

400

concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere (~0.04%) compared to more concentrated CO₂ streams, which

401

results in significantly lower carbonate concentrations.[64] This low concentration challenges the efficient

402

formation of carbonates and makes substantial mineral carbonate precipitation from atmospheric CO₂

403

difficult, especially at near-neutral pH. In contrast, as described above, the CA-LS bionanoreactor could

404

overcome this limitation by combining the effects of AaLS-13 to concentrate Mg²⁺ ions with the biocatalytic

405

activity of encapsulated ngCA-R5 to facilitate CO₂ hydration. This synergy enhances MgCO3 formation

406

and the mineralization of atmospheric CO2, making the CA-LS bionanoreactor a more sustainable solution

407

for DAC compared to other methods that require more stringent conditions.[65]

3. Conclusions

410

In summary, this study develops and demonstrates a bionanoreactor approach based on AaLS-13

411

nanocages and CA enzyme to enable effective carbon mineralization under mild, ambient conditions. The

412

assembled AaLS-13 nanocage, with its highly negatively charged interior surface, exhibits a strong capacity

413

and affinity for uptaking Mg2+ ions from surrounding solutions, concentrating them within its cavity.

414

Notably, the uptake efficiency is dependent on salt concentration, peaking at 0.1 mM NaCl and decreasing

415

at both lower and higher NaCl levels. This pattern suggests the critical role of AaLS-13 nanocage’s

416

assembled structure in facilitating metal cation interactions, thereby enhancing their availability for

417

subsequent reactions. By encapsulating the CA enzyme tagged with a cationic polypeptide, the resulting

418

CA-LS bionanoreactors retain their catalytic activity, demonstrating effectiveness in p-NPA hydrolysis and

419

CO2 hydration. Leveraging the catalytic capabilities of the CA-LS bionanoreactors alongside their ability

420

to concentrate Mg2+, these bionanoreactors achieve significantly accelerated rates of CO2 mineralization.

421

They are capable of mediating the mineralization of CO2 from solutions while also effectively capturing

422

and mineralizing atmospheric CO2 at near-neutral pH in the presence of metal cations. Collectively, these

423

findings lay a foundation for utilizing protein nanocage-based enzyme bionanoreactors for sustainable

424

carbon mineralization, presenting an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional CCS and DAC

425

approaches. In addition, this work provides new insights into leveraging protein nanocage-substrate

426

interactions to modulate local microenvironments and enhance biochemical reactions, which could inform

427

future advancements in the use of AaLS-13 protein nanocages to fine-tune enzyme catalysis, with potential

428

applications across diverse biotechnological, biomedical, and environmental fields.

4. Experimental Section

430

Production and Purification of AaLS-13 and ngCA-R5

431

The DNA sequence for ngCA, including a 6´His tag, was codon-optimized for expression in E.

432

coli and purchased in a pET-21b+ expression vector (ngCA-6His-pET21b+) from GenScript. An R5 peptide

433

(Ser-Ser-Lys-Lys-Ser-Gly-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Gly-Ser-Lys-Gly-Ser-Lys-Arg-Arg-Ile-Leu) coding sequence was

434

inserted between ngCA and 6´His using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit from New England Biolabs,

435

with custom primers R5-F and R5-R (Table S1) ordered from Azenta. The constructed plasmid (ngCA-R5-

436

6His-pET21b+) was amplified in E. coli DH5α cells (New England Biolabs) and verified through Sanger

437

sequencing. Additionally, the gene encoding AaLS-13 with a 6´His t ag was synthesized based on its amino

438

acid sequence,[28] codon optimized for E. coli expression, and purchased in a pET-28b+ expression vector

439

(AaLS-13-6His-pET28b+) from GenScript.

440

Subsequently, ngCA-R5-6His-pET21b+ and AaLS-13-6His-pET28b+ vectors were transformed

441

into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs), and protein expression was carried out following

442

standard protocols. Briefly, positive transformants were first grown overnight in lysogeny broth (LB)

443

medium supplemented with antibiotics (50 µg/mL ampicillin for ngCA-R5-6His-pET21b+ and 30 µg/mL

444

kanamycin for AaLS-13-6His-pET28b+). Two ml of the overnight culture was then used to inoculate 200

445

mL of fresh LB medium, which was incubated at 37 °C, 250 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6-0.8 was reached.

446

Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and for

447

ngCA expression, 0.1 mM zinc chloride (ZnCl2) was also added. Following induction, cultures were grown

448

at 20 °C, 250 rpm for 20 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, 12,000 ´ g for 10 minutes,

449

and the collected cell pellets were stored at -80 °C until use.

450

For protein extraction, frozen cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH

451

8.0, 5% glycerol) containing SIGMAFAST EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore Sigma). Cell

452

lysis was conducted on ice using a Branson Sonifier 550 in pulse mode with 10% intensity, with 50 ms on

453

and 50 ms off intervals. The procedure involved ten 30-second cycles of sonication, with a 30-second pause

between each cycle to prevent overheating. The crude cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 ´ g for 20

455

minutes at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant, containing soluble target proteins, was collected and then

456

purified using Hispur Ni-NTA affinity resins (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s

457

protocol. In brief, the supernatant was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA column, which selectively

458

binds to the 6´His-tagged proteins. After binding, the column was washed with a wash buffer (50 mM

459

HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) to remove non-specifically bound proteins and

460

other contaminants. The bound 6´His-tagged proteins were eluted using an elution buffer containing 50

461

mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. The eluted fractions were collected, analyzed

462

for protein purity using SDS-PAGE, and further desalted using PD-10 desalting columns (Cytiva) to remove

463

imidazole. The purified ngCA-R5 was stored at 4 °C in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0), and the purified

464

AaLS-13 was left at room temperature to assemble in 50 mM, pH 8.0 HEPES buffer with 5 mM EDTA and

465

10% 5 M NaCl for at least a week. Protein concentrations in the purified samples were determined using a

466

bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

467
468

SEC Purification of Assembled AaLS-13 Nanocages and CA-LS Bionanoreactors

469

Assembled AaLS-13 protein nanocages and CA-LS bionanoreactors were purified using an NGC

470

Quest 10 fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Bio-rad) equipped with a HiPrep 16/60

471

Sephacryl S-400 HR column (Cytiva) for AaLS-13 and a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva)

472

for CA-LS. Protein samples ranging from 250 µL to 5 mL were loaded onto the columns, and SEC was

473

performed using SEC buffer (50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min at 4 °C.

474

UV-Vis absorbance at 280 nm was monitored to detect protein elution, and all fractions were collected for

475

further analysis by SDS-PAGE.

478

SDS-PAGE was performed using Any kD mini-PROTEAN TGX stain-free protein gels in the

479

Tris/Tricine/SDS Running Buffer (Bio-rad). For each sample, 45 µL was mixed with 15 µL of 4´ sample

480

buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After vortexing, 20 µL of the heated sample was loaded onto the gel.

481

Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 150 V for approximately 45 minutes at room

482

temperature. Unstained Precision Plus Protein Standards (Bio-rad) were used as molecular weight markers.

483

The gel was visualized using an Azure 300 gel imaging system.

DLS Analysis

486

Sizing and polydispersity measurements of AaLS-13 nanocages were performed using a Beckman

487

Coulter Particle Size Analyzer at room temperature. Assembled AaLS-13 samples were diluted to a protein

488

concentration of 1 mg/mL in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0), filtered through 0.22µm low protein retention

489

membrane, and immediately subjected to DLS analysis.

490
491

Negative Stain TEM

492

Purified, assembled AaLS-13 nanocages were prepared for negative-stain TEM by diluting the

493

sample to a concentration of 5 µM in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0). Copper grids (200 mesh, pure carbon

494

film with no Formvar, PELCO) were utilized for sample preparation. The grid was carefully placed onto

495

20 µL of the protein solution and incubated for 2 minutes to allow sufficient adsorption. Excess liquid was

496

then removed by wicking with filter paper. The grid then was briefly rinsed in 0.22 µm membrane-filtered

497

deionized (DI) water for 1 minute and wicked again with filter paper. This rinsing process was repeated

498

three times. Subsequently, staining was performed by placing the grid onto 20 µL of 2% uranyl acetate

499

solution and incubating for an additional 2 minutes. The excess stain was removed using filter paper, and

500

the grid was air-dried before being stored at room temperature for imaging. TEM images were captured

501

using a Hitachi H9500 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV at the Nanoscale Fabrication

502

and Characterization Facility (NFCF) at the University of Pittsburgh.

Evaluation of Mg2+ Encapsulation within AaLS-13 Protein Nanocage

505

Purified, assembled AaLS-13 nanocages were mixed with varying concentrations of MgCl₂ in 50

mM, pH 8.0 HEPES buffer. Different concentrations of AaLS-13 and NaCl, as well as varying incubation

507

desalting columns (the columns were pre-prepared by centrifuging at 1000 ´ g for 2 min to remove buffer).

509

The sample mixture was loaded onto the columns, where free Mg²⁺ ions were retained by the resin, while

515

Assembled AaLS-13 nanocages were mixed with purified ngCA-R5 in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH

516

8.0), maintaining a final AaLS-13 monomer concentration of <100 μM. The concentration of ngCA-R5 was

517

adjusted to be no more than one-fifth of the AaLS-13 monomer concentration. The final NaCl concentration

518

in the mixture was approximately 200 mM. This mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight to

519

allow for the encapsulation of ngCA-R5 within AaLS-13 nanocages.

520
521

pNPA Colorimetric Assay for Measuring CA Activity

522

CA catalyzes the hydrolysis of pNPA, producing p-nitrophenol, a yellow product with strong

523

absorbance at 405 nm. The assay was conducted in a 2 mL cuvette by preparing a reaction mixture

524

consisting of 400 µL 0.1 mM pNPA in 50 mM, pH 7.4 Tris buffer, and 10 µL AaLS-13-encapsulated ngCA-

525

R5. The absorbance of the reaction mixture at 405 nm was recorded every 30 seconds over a 3-minute

526

period using a NanoDrop OneC UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

529

The CA-LS bionanoreactors were mixed with MgCl2 solution and CO2-saturated water in a 1.5 mL

530

tube. CO2-saturated water was prepared by passing DI water through a 0.22 µm filter, cooling it in an ice-

531

water slurry, and bubbling CO2 gas at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for 30 min. The final solution contained 1

532

mM Mg2+ and 5.6 mM CO2, which was then incubated with CA-LS (CA enzyme activity of 1 Wilbur–

533

Anderson unit/mL measured by the phenol red assay and 2 mg/mL of AaLS-13) at room temperature

534

overnight to allow the precipitate to form.[66] Unencapsulated CA/LS and LS only controls were prepared

535

using the same CA activity and AaLS-13 concentration. The final volume of the mixture was 1.4 mL. After

536

thorough vortexing, 200 µL samples were taken, centrifuged at 12,000 ´ g three times to remove the

537

supernatant, and the remaining pellets were dissolved in an acidic buffer (50 mM HEPES + 1% nitric acid)

538

for Mg2+ quantification using ICP-OES.

539
540

XRD Characterization

541

The pellet formed by incubating Mg2+ and CO2 with CA-LS was collected and dried in a desiccator

542

at room temperature. XRD data were obtained using a Bruker X-ray Diffraction System at the Nanoscale

543

Fabrication and Characterization Facility (NFCF) at the University of Pittsburgh. Scans were conducted

544

over a 2θ range of 10° to 95°, with a step size of 0.05° and a counting time of 2 seconds per step. The

545

resulting diffraction patterns were analyzed using DIFFRAC.EVA to identify the peaks present and

546

compare them with reference diffraction data.

547
548

Direct Air Capture

549

The ability of CA-LS bionanoreactors to capture and mineralize CO2 directly from the air was

550

assessed using CA-LS bionanoreactors, assembled AaLS-13 nanocages, and purified ngCA-R5 in 50 mM

551

HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 40 mM MgCl2 with the final concentrations of 0.75 mg/mL AaLS-13

552

and/or 64.7 WAU/mL ngCA-R5. The mixtures were placed in 4 mL glass vials with loose caps and

553

incubated at room temperature for 48 hours. To monitor the MgCO3 precipitation over time, 800 µL samples

554

were taken at various time intervals, and each sample was centrifuged at 12,000 ´ g three times to remove

This study introduces a bionanoreactor approach for sustainable carbon capture and sequestration

685

(CCS) using self-assembling AaLS-13 protein nanocages. Encapsulating carbonic anhydrase, these

686

nanocages concentrate metal cations to facilitate CO2 mineralization under benign, ambient conditions,

687

efficiently converting both dissolved and atmospheric CO2 into stable carbonate minerals. The findings

688

highlight AaLS-13-based bionanoreactors as a sustainable CCS alternative and provide new insights for

689

leveraging AaLS-13-substrate interactions to enhance enzyme catalysis in diverse future applications.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

13

Phenol Red CO2 Hydration Activity Assay

14

CO2-saturated water was prepared by bubbling CO2 gas through ice-cold deionized water at a flow

15

rate of 1 L/min for 30 minutes, achieving a saturation concentration of approximately 40 mM. This saturated

16

solution was then diluted with ice water to obtain final CO2 concentrations of 10 mM. A 100 µM phenol

17

red solution was prepared in a 20 mM HEPES buffer at pH 8.3. The reaction mixture, consisting of 200 µL

18

of the phenol red solution, 10 µL of purified CA-LS, and 200 µL of 10 mM CO2 solution, was rapidly mixed

19

in a 2 mL cuvette. The cuvette was then immediately put in a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop OneC

20

Spectrophotometer, and the absorbance at 560 nm was continuously monitored at 2-second intervals. The

21

color change from orange to yellow in the phenol red solution indicates a shift from a slightly alkaline or

22

neutral pH towards a more acidic environment, as CA catalyzes the conversion of CO2 and water into

23

bicarbonate and protons (H⁺). The increased concentration of H⁺ lowers the pH, leading to the protonation

24

of phenol red and the associated color shift.

Figure S3. (a) Spectrophotometric data from phenol red assays measuring CO2 hydration activity of CA-

37

LS bionanoreactors. Absorbance at 560 nm was recorded every 2 seconds for a total of 14 seconds. The

38

enzyme free control group was performed under the same experimental conditions for comparison. The

39

absorbance of the CA-LS added group demonstrated a more rapid and steep decline as compared to the

40

enzyme free control group. (b) Pictures illustrating the solution color difference between the encapsulated

41

ngCA-R5 within AaLS-13 nanocage and enzyme free groups. The CA-LS added group appeared yellow

42

due to a decrease in pH, while the enzyme-free control remained orange.
