Abstract

14

We combined and correlated non-target screening (NTS) features and extractable organic

15

fluorine (EOF) data for PFAS analysis in environmental samples. Soils, sediments, and ashes

16

from different locations (Germany, France, Lithuania) (n=34) were extracted and analyzed via

17

liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and high resolution-

18

continuum source-graphite furnace molecular absorption spectrometry (HR-CS-GFMAS).

19

NTS feature prioritization based on the mass to carbon (m/C) and mass defect to carbon

20

(MD/C) ratio was applied to discriminate potential PFAS features from common co-extracted

21

organic matrix. Our results show a high correlation between quantitative EOF data with the

22

prioritized feature number (R2 = 0.87, rPearson = 0.93) as well as with the total peak area of

23

prioritized features (R2 = 0.97, rPearson = 0.98) while commonly applied MD-ranges for filtering

24

showed much weaker correlation with EOF. The observed highly significant correlations

25

highlight that MD/C-m/C prioritization is associated with a good indication of the overall PFAS

26

burden as evidenced by EOF. Also, semi-quantitative data can be extracted from PFAS-specific

27

NTS as shown for the EOF vs. prioritized peak areas. The correlations indicate that lowly

28

fluorinated compounds were negligible and that the EOF was mostly composed of higher

29

fluorinated substances. We recommend further investigation of the unique complementary

30

EOF vs. NTS combination for PFAS screening.

Introduction

41

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous contaminants posing adverse

42

effects to humans and the environment.1, 2 The analysis of PFAS in environmental samples is

43

very challenging because of their diverse physical/chemical properties and the high number of

44

individual PFAS compounds.3 Target analysis is not feasible for a comprehensive

45

characterization as only a few PFAS can be quantified, thereby often drastically

46

underestimating the total PFAS burden.4, 5 Thus, current analytical trends emphasize

47

complementary approaches based on organofluorine sum parameters and non-target screening

48

(NTS) for a higher PFAS coverage.6-8

49

Organofluorine sum parameters are used to determine the gap between PFAS targets and total

50

organically bound fluorine and thereby indicate the quantity of unidentified extractable organic

51

fluorine (EOF).9 EOF sample preparation is combined with fluorine-sensitive and -specific

52

detection systems like high resolution-continuum source-graphite furnace molecular

53

absorption spectrometry (HR-CS-GFMAS).10, 11 However, this method is not able to provide

54

information on compound identity and is therefore limited to total fluorine quantification as all

55

species information is lost.

56

To unravel the unknown gaps in PFAS mass balances while preserving species information,

57

NTS approaches can be utilized.12 NTS based on high resolution-mass spectrometry (HRMS)

58

is very powerful to identify unknown PFAS in various samples.13 Usually after data reduction

59

and prioritization, unknown compounds can be identified by accurate mass, isotope pattern,

60

and characteristic fragmentation.14 Eventually, the acquired information is usually compared

61

with chemical databases (suspect screening) and molecular structures of the analytes are

62

identified without the need for analytical standards.15 For PFAS, several intrinsic properties

63

can be used for feature prioritization in NTS.6 The chemical mass defect (MD) is often used

64

for prioritization of potentially unknown PFAS by removing features outside a defined MD

65

range due to the typically high number of F atoms resulting in negative to slightly positive

66

MDs.16, 17 However, many other compounds fall in the same MD range as PFAS, hence, further

67

improved prioritization is required to reduce false positives. Therefore, the mass and the MD

68

of every feature can be normalized to the carbon number C (MD/C-m/C) which is retrieved

69

from the ratio of the abundance of the monoisotopic mass (IM) and abundance of the M+1

70

isotopic peak (IM+1) and the natural abundance of 13C according to the following equation:

71

C ≈ IM+1/IM/0.011145.18 Plotting MD/C versus the m/C strongly discriminates PFAS (and other

72

compounds with similar heteroatom fractions) from many common organic matrix compounds

73

(Figure S1). The technique is primarily based on the mass increase when a H is replaced by a

74

F. Even though data filtering in PFAS NTS was much improved, final identification approaches

75

are still time-consuming, especially for novel PFAS poorly represented in databases.

76

Furthermore, most NTS approaches remain solely qualitative and quantitative information is

77

missing.19

78

While the EOF provides quantitative information, the identity of individual compounds is not

79

provided. On the other hand, during NTS, usually not all detected features can be identified,

80

but advanced prioritization using the MD/C-m/C dimension is very promising. However, this

81

approach could not be validated with experimental HRMS-data originating from environmental

82

samples which fraction truly originates from PFAS. Hence, the overall aim of our study is to

83

combine EOF analysis with NTS to correlate quantitative information (EOF) with feature

84

prioritization approaches (e.g., MD/C-m/C). This approach allows us to draw quantitative

85

conclusions on the comprehensiveness of PFAS-specific NTS by the unique information

86

provided by the EOF. To the best of our knowledge, this study comprises the first approach to

87

correlate EOF and NTS data in various matrices.

Materials and Methods

89

Soil samples. In total 34 samples from Germany, France, and Lithuania were used for NTS vs.

90

EOF correlation which included 25 soils, 4 compost samples, 2 sediments, 2 sewage sludge

91

ashes and one filter cake after soil washing. The samples included several soils with known

92

PFAS contamination from PFAS containing paper sludge20 and fire-fighting activities near an

93

airport.

94

Sample extraction. The detailed extraction procedure is provided in the SI.11

95

EOF analysis by HR-CS-GFMAS

96

EOF analysis using HR-CS-GFMAS was based on an optimized method for PFAS analysis by

97

Simon et al. A contrAA 800 HR-CS-GFMAS system and the software ASpect CS 2.2.2.0 (both

98

Analytik Jena AG) were used for fluorine analysis.21 The method is based on the indirect

99

analysis of fluorine using the GaF absorption wavelength at 211.248 nm.

100

Non-target screening data acquisition. Sample extracts were analyzed with an Agilent 1260

101

Infinity HPLC (Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, 2.7 µm particles at 40 °C)

102

coupled to an Agilent 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF)-mass spectrometer. Details on

103

gradient elution, source- and instrument parameters can be found elsewhere.22 Extracts were

104

measured undiluted and in a 1:10 dilution in negative and positive electrospray ionization (ESI)

105

mode in both full-scan and data-dependent acquisition (ddMS2) (scan range 100 – 1700 m/z, 3

106

spectra/s, details on the ddMS2 method in Zweigle et al. 2023).22 As quality control, labelled

107

internal standards of several PFAAs (Table S1) were spiked in each sample via the autosampler

108

(20 pg of each labelled PFAA internal standard). At least every 10th sample a MeOH blank and

109

a PFAA standard mix (Table S1) were measured to monitor the instrument response. To avoid

110

cross contamination, a 3-fold needle wash was performed and the batches were measured in

111

order of increasing EOF concentration.

NTS workflow and correlation. Agilent MS data files were converted to mzML using the

113

MSConvert software.23 To detect features in the HRMS raw data, several modified Python

114

scripts from the PFΔScreen software tool22 were used (feature detection details in the SI).24, 25

115

To remove background signals from solvent and LC system, a blank correction was performed

116

(details in SI). For a prioritization towards potential PFAS features the MD, m/C and MD/C

117

ratios were calculated. PFAAs were semi-quantified (one-point calibration) via spiked internal

118

standards (Table S1).

119

Several prioritization techniques (e.g., MD/C-m/C) were applied and feature numbers and the

120

sum of the chromatographic peak areas of the prioritized features were correlated with EOF

121

data. To deduce ideal prioritization boundaries (e.g., m/C cutoff), the data were iteratively

122

correlated while removing more features in each step to determine the maximum possible

123

correlation coefficient. Therefore, the boundaries to remove features in the MD/C-m/C

124

dimensions were iteratively changed by moving towards the CF2-location (MD/C = -0.003,

125

m/C = 50) in 25 steps. For every iteration, the Euclidean distance from the boundary to the

126

CF2-location was calculated (details in the SI).

Results and Discussion

129

Correlation of EOF with NTS data. In total, 34 environmental samples originating mainly

130

from different soils were analyzed for quantitative EOF via HR-CS-GFMAS and by NTS via

131

LC-HRMS for potential PFAS. Thereby, during NTS analysis, different PFAS-specific feature

132

prioritization approaches were correlated with quantitative EOF data to gain insights into the

133

advantages and disadvantages of different NTS data treatment approaches for PFAS. To cover

134

a representative range of environmental matrices, the samples investigated included a variety

135

of low contaminated sediments (background levels) and highly PFAS contaminated samples

136

originating from known and unknown pollution sources. For instance, selected soils were from

137

agricultural sites or subject to contamination with PFAS used for paper coatings and fire-

138

fighting activities (aqueous-film forming foams, AFFF) close to an airport. The sample pool

139

includes soil samples from urban and non-urban areas. Besides the “traditional PFAS” with

140

high fluorine content (e.g., PFAAs, diPAPs, different AFFF classes), the agricultural samples

141

might be also influenced by fluorinated pesticides which potentially add to EOF but are

142

difficult to prioritize during NTS.

143

The determined EOF span a wide range of from < LOQ up to 15030 µg/kg dry weight with a

144

median and mean of 128 and 1445 µg/kg, respectively (Table S2). After NTS preprocessing,

145

between 202 and 5390 features with a median and mean of 668 and 1189 were detected via

146

LC-HRMS with negative ESI (discussion of ESI+ later). The applied parameters already

147

included a componentization of related isotopes (total feature number after isotope

148

componentization: 40431, Figure S2). As expected, no correlation between total feature

149

number and EOF was observed (R2 = 0, rPearson = -0.06; Figure S3), which was also true for

150

∑peak areas of all features vs. EOF (R2 = 0.01, rPearson = -0.1). A much better correlation was

151

achieved using the MD/C-m/C dimension as restrictor. Since potential highly fluorinated

152

features (high probability to be PFAS) were shown to be found in the vicinity of m/C ≈ 50

153

(e.g., m/CPFOA ≈ 52) and MD/C ≈ -0.003, and only features in a range from m/C of 40 to 60 and

154

MD/C -0.01 to 0.003 were prioritized.18 This allowed the subdivision of features with high

155

probability to be PFAS although their identity might be unknown at this point. It should be

156

highlighted here, that even a cutoff at m/C = 40 resulted in highly efficient prioritization (>98%

157

data reduction) since only 1.6% of the 40431 features in all samples remained (Figure S2).

158

After applying this prioritization strategy, a highly significant positive correlation of the feature

159

number in all samples vs. EOF was observed (R2 = 0.87, rPearson = 0.93, p-value = 7×10-16;

160

Figure 1a). In this correlation, every feature regardless of its intensity has an identical

161

contribution. This significant correlation allowed several conclusions about the prioritized

162

features without their actual identification: (1) Most features in the prioritized range of the

163

analyzed samples must be PFAS, since a significant number of other features would decrease

164

the correlation coefficient. This is an important finding, since although there is a wide variety

165

of elemental compositions that could locate in the prioritized MD/C-m/C range (e.g., high

166

chlorine, bromine, iodine, or oxygen content), they seem to play only a minor role in the

167

investigated samples. (2) Within the sample pool, although qualitative, the number of

168

prioritized features can be indicative for PFAS content and can therefore be used for sample

169

prioritization. (3) Less fluorinated compounds (e.g., fluorinated pesticides) potentially present

170

in the samples cannot significantly contribute to the EOF since most of them are outside of the

171

used MD/C-m/C range. For example, the 423 fluorinated pesticides from the NORMAN

172

FLUOROPEST suspect list have a mean m/C of 22.6 while more than 95 % have an m/C <

173

40.26 These conclusions are a result of the unique combination of quantitative EOF with NTS

174

data, since usually not all features can be identified, especially the ones with very low

175

abundance which seem to play a minor role within the EOF as well.

176
177

186

Figure 1: Correlation of different feature prioritization metrics (e.g., MD/C-m/C dimensions, ESI negative) vs.
quantitative EOF data for 34 different environmental samples with and without known PFAS contamination.
Shown are correlations of EOF vs. (a) number of detected features and (b) sum of peak areas within a range of 40
< m/C < 60 and –0.01 < MD/C < 0.003. In subfigure (c) the correlation of the semi-quantified PFAAs (C4-C18
PFCAs and C4-C12 PFSAs) and EOF mass fractions is shown. Further, the EOF was correlated with (d) the number
of features after prioritization with a MD-range from –0.25 to +0.1 similar as used in other studies (e.g.,16, 17, 27, 28)
(sum of peak areas vs. EOF with MD filtering are shown in Figure S4). It becomes obvious that via the MD/Cm/C dimensions prioritized features correlated with EOF mass fractions show a high correlation coefficient
indicating no significant fractions of non-PFAS can be present in this feature pool. Violet areas indicate the 95%
confidence intervals of the linear regression.

187

To also correlate more quantitative information present in the HRMS data, the sum of peak

188

areas of prioritized features were correlated with EOF (Figure 1b). Although the ionization

189

response of organic substances in ESI spans several orders of magnitude,29 a highly significant

190

positive correlation was observed with EOF data (R2 = 0.97; rPearson = 0.98, p-value = 1×10-25).

191

It should be noted that for this correlation the abundance of only a few features contribute

192

mainly to the sum of the peak areas. For instance, in the three samples with the highest EOF,

193

50% of the total prioritized peak areas was composed of only 10%, 6% and 7% of the feature

194

numbers in the prioritized space. This shows that peak areas of the most prominent prioritized

195

PFAS features are representative of the majority of determined EOF in the investigated

196

samples. In contrast, the semi-quantification approach with C4-C18 PFCAs and C4-C12 PFSAs

197

showed a slightly lower correlation (R2 = 0.85; rPearson = 0.92, p-value = 1×10-14; Figure 1c).

198

This result is surprising, as the estimated concentration (one-point calibration) of PFAAs via

199

internal standards is associated with a higher analytical accuracy compared to using the

200

prioritizes feature number or Σpeak areas. An explanation could be that several samples are

201

known to be dominated by other PFAS than PFAAs [e.g., diPAPs, fluorotelomer sulfonic acids

202

(FTSAs), N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide ethanol–based phosphate diester (diSAmPAP),

203

fluorotelomer alkyl phosphate esters (FTMAPs), several substituted PFSAs (e.g., Cl-PFOS)]

204

that contribute substantially to the determined EOF.22 This highlights that prioritization and

205

semi-quantification via the MD/C-m/C dimension are associated with a good indication of the

206

overall PFAS burden. Considering only PFAAs leads to an underestimation of the PFAS

207

burden with a high uncertainty since variable contributions of unknown PFAS, often

208

overlooked, can be present.30

209

For the correlation between features prioritized only by typical MD-ranges (e.g., -0.25 to +0.1)

210

as already reported,16, 17, 27, 31 a much higher fraction of features that are not PFAS was present

211

(high number of false-positives) (Figure 1d). When applying a MD range from –0.25 to +0.1,

212

the feature number did not show a positive correlation with EOF (R2 = 0.01; rPearson = 0.12) and

213

also the correlation with Σpeak areas was much lower compared to the filtering via MD/C-m/C

214

(R2 = 0.28; rPearson = 0.53; Figure S4). This is probably a consequence of high matrix content in

215

samples with high organic matter load. There were many features with masses both below 400
10

216

Da and above 800 Da that fall into the used MD range. The high masses often strongly exceeded

217

a positive MD of +0.5 Da, which was erroneously assigned to a negative MD due to

218

mathematical rounding.22 Those features were easily removed by their m/C ratio, however, not

219

by this MD-range (much higher feature number). This is exemplified for the sample with the

220

highest feature number originating from a soil influenced by smoldering fires (Figure S5). It

221

should be noted that if a very narrow MD-range from -0.1 to 0 Da is applied, which somehow

222

fits the prevailing PFAS pattern in the samples, a much higher correlation can also be achieved

223

by MD filtering (Figure S6). However, background information on the kind of PFAS would be

224

required to apply this narrow MD-range, and such narrow filtering increases the risk to exclude

225

true positives which are more easily prioritized by the m/C ratio.

226

Similar correlations of MD/C-m/C prioritized features with EOF were observed in the samples

227

for positive ESI measurements, however, in general much less features were detected in the

228

prioritized MD/C-m/C range, indicating that most detectable PFAS are anionic (Figure S7).

229

Overall, the m/C ratio shows a much higher specificity towards PFAS and to the best of our

230

knowledge, this was not yet reported for prioritized (unidentified) features from LC-HRMS

231

data by complementary quantitative EOF data.

232

Optimization of prioritization within the MD/C-m/C dimensions. To determine ideal

233

prioritization boundaries for the investigated samples, the correlation between EOF and NTS

234

was calculated iteratively while changing the cutoff of m/C, MD/C (and MD) (Figure 2). For

235

the investigated samples, a cutoff at m/C > 25 already resulted in a very efficient prioritization

236

(high correlation over a wide prioritization range). This also means that, by applying the m/C

237

dimension, also PFAS with a considerable H-content (m/C between 25 and 30) might be

238

separable from the main organic compounds in those samples. For instance, in our data this

239

would be possible for most PFAS with an m/C > 25 (Figure S2). In the case of MD-filtering,

240

the false-positive rate is rather high over a wide MD-range and only a narrow MD-range results

11

241

in high correlation. This range, however, strongly depends on the type of PFAS (e.g., increased

242

H-content) and it is more difficult to use the prioritized features as an indicator for the expected

243

PFAS burden since too many compounds fall into a similar MD-range.

Figure 2: Calculation of optimal restrictions of MD/C-m/C and MD cutoff towards a high correlation of feature
number and sum of peak areas with EOF. Top: R2 vs. Euclidean distance of the prioritization boundaries to the
CF2-location (MD/C-m/C = -0.003, 50) in the MD/C-m/C plot. The range was restricted from m/C = 10 and 110
towards 50 and MD/C = -0.05 and +0.05 towards –0.003 in 25 iterations. Bottom: Similar calculations for MD as
prioritization. Here, the MD range was restricted from –0.5 and +0.5 towards –0.03 (typical MD of e.g., PFOA).
It should be noted that this only provides an overview of the present samples and is dependent on the present
matrix compounds in the HRMS measurement. It becomes obvious that while the MD/C-m/C filtering correlates
well over a wide prioritization range, in case of the MD only a very narrow (usually unknown) MD-window
results in high correlation. Details on the calculations can be found in the SI.

Environmental implications. The present study highlights the unique complementary

256

combination of PFAS-specific feature prioritization in HRMS data and quantitative EOF

257

analyses. It showed for the first time that most features prioritized by the m/C and MD/C ratio

258

must originate from highly fluorinated compounds in different environmental samples (n = 34).

259

As a result, we suggest that the EOF was composed of mainly highly fluorinated compounds

260

as well. Thus, using this unique combination of techniques, our approach highlights

261

possibilities for quantification for PFAS in NTS. We, therefore, recommend further

262

investigation of this approach for environmental samples with a wider array of EOF and PFAS

263

profiles, since sample prioritization based on the presented approaches is efficient without

264

comprehensive and time-consuming identification. Future studies could extend correlations to

265

further parameters such as the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay (indirect and direct) or

266

absorbable organic fluoride (AOF) as well as complementary separation or ionization types

267

(e.g., gas chromatography and chemical ionization) for HRMS.
