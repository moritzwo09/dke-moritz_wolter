Abstract
Recent research has shown that microplastics are widespread in the atmosphere. However, we
know little about their ability to nucleate ice and their impact on ice formation in clouds. Ice
nucleation by microplastics could also limit their long-range transport and global distribution. The
present study explores the heterogeneous ice-nucleating ability of seven microplastic samples in
the immersion-freezing mode. Two polypropylene samples and one polyethylene terephthalate
sample froze heterogeneously with median freezing temperatures of -20.9°C, -23.2°C and -21.9°C,
respectively. The number of ice nucleation sites per surface area, 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇), ranged from 10-1 to 104
cm-2 in a temperature interval of -15 to -25°C, which is comparable to that of volcanic ash and
fungal spores. After exposure to ozone or a combination of UV light and ozone, simulating
atmospheric aging, the ice nucleation activity decreased in some cases and remained unchanged
in others. Our freezing data suggest that microplastics may promote ice formation in cloud
droplets. In addition, based on a comparison of our freezing results and previous simulations using
a global transport model, ice nucleation by microplastics will impact their long-range transport to
faraway locations and global distribution.

Introduction
In the absence of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the atmosphere, cloud droplets freeze
homogeneously at a temperature of approximately -35°C.1,2 In the presence of INPs, cloud droplets
can freeze at higher temperatures. After INPs initiate the formation of ice in cloud droplets, the
resulting ice crystals can grow at the expense of liquid droplets since the saturation water vapor
pressure is lower over ice than over water. In addition, ice crystals may further grow by collisions
until they attain a size that causes them to fall out of the cloud, ultimately contributing to the
formation of precipitation. Notably, a substantial fraction of global precipitation proceeds via these
processes.4,5 INPs also influence the optical properties and lifetimes of clouds, with implications
for the cloud albedo effect. Atmospheric ice nucleation thus influences the hydrological cycle and
radiative budget, underlining the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the
properties, concentration, and sources of INPs in the atmosphere.
The ability of atmospheric particles to nucleate ice also influences their long-range transport and
concentrations in the atmosphere. When aerosol particles trigger ice nucleation followed by
precipitation, the atmospheric concentration and long-range transport of the aerosol particles can
be reduced. For example, a study by Haga et al.6 showed that ice nucleation on fungal spores,
which have only modest freezing efficiencies (freezing range -20 to –30°C), leads to a decrease in
the annual mean concentrations of fungal spores in remote regions and the upper troposphere.
Natural sources of INPs include mineral dust7,8, volcanic ash9–11, and biological particles (e.g.
pollen12,13 and archaea14). Possible anthropogenic sources of INPs include soot15 and coal fly
ash.16,17 With the advent of large-scale plastic production and consumption, microplastics have
emerged as a potential new class of anthropogenic INPs.18,19

In 2015, Dris et al.20 first detected microplastic aerosols in the atmosphere. Since then,
researchers have tried to identify the sources of these aerosols.21,22 Tire wear particles from roads
are thought to be one of the most significant sources of plastics to the atmosphere, followed by
microplastics ejected to the atmosphere with sea spray aerosol and agricultural soil dust.23
Additionally, microplastics originating from the breakdown of frequently used commercial
products, such as polyester clothing, can contribute to the release of plastic fibers into the
atmosphere.24
Recent studies showed the pivotal role of the atmosphere as a transport system for microplastics
connecting natural and urban systems.26,27 As microplastics get transported throughout the
atmosphere, aging is induced by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and oxidants, such as ozone
(O3). This aging process can oxidize the surface and bulk of microplastics, changing the
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and chemical properties of the particles. Such changes will likely
modify the ability of microplastics to nucleate ice.
Only a few studies have investigated the ice nucleating ability of microplastics.18 Ganguly and
Ariya18 synthesized three microplastics types (polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, and highdensity polyethylene) in the laboratory and quantified their freezing properties using a droplet
freezing technique. Teska et al. investigated the ice nucleation ability of fibers from casual apparel
consisting of acrylic, polyester, nylon, and a combination of cotton, polyester, viscose and elastane.
Since microplastics can vary widely in terms of particle composition and morphology, additional
studies are still needed to better understand the ice nucleation ability of microplastics. Studies on
the ice nucleation ability of microplastics formed by the breakdown of frequently used products
are especially necessary as these materials may contribute significantly to the microplastic burden

of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effect of atmospheric aging by O3 or UV radiation on the ice
nucleation properties of microplastics remains unstudied.
Here, we investigate the ice nucleation ability of seven different microplastics substances in the
immersion freezing mode. We focus on polymers prevalent in the atmosphere21: polypropylene
(PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE). For each polymer type, we included
at least one commercial sample and one sample generated from the breakdown of a frequently
used commercial product. We further test if ice nucleation changes after exposure to O3 and a
combination of UV light and O3.

Materials and Methods
Samples
Table 1 provides an overview of all samples used. We procured the commercial samples PPneedlesc, PET-spheresc, and PE-spheresc from Nanochemazone (Leduc, AB, Canada) and PPspheresc from Goonvean Fibers (Cullompton, UK). In addition to commercially sourced samples,
we generated samples by the breakdown of each polymer type in the laboratory: PP-fibersb
originating from a PP rope (The Home Depot, Everbilt Light-Duty Diamond Braid Rope, Model
# 301831), PE-flakesb from a PE cup (The Home Depot, LESSO Test Cap 3, Model # RLN132030), and PET-fibersb originating from PET textile. To obtain PP-fibersb and PE-flakesb, we first
cut the rope and the cup into small pieces (approximately 1 cm long), then dipped them into liquid
nitrogen, broke them apart using a mortar and pestle, and then passed the material through a filter
sieve. PET-fibersb were made by Cotton Incorporated (North Carolina, USA), which produces
standard fiber textiles for environmental assessments and toxicity studies. We cut the PET fabric
into small pieces of approximately 1 cm2 and then ground them using a Wiley Mill 134.

Characterization (FTIR, SEM)
We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy to determine the morphology and chemistry of all microplastic samples.
SEM imaging was performed using a Scanning Electron Microscope SU3500 (Hitachi) with a
secondary electron detector. All images, unless noted, were collected using a low 1.5 kV
acceleration voltage to ensure real surface imaging at high and low magnification to characterize
morphology and size, respectively. More details on the SEM methodology are provided in the
Supplement Information.

IR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Perkin Elmer FTIR spectrometer equipped

Droplet Freezing Experiments
We assessed the ice nucleation activity of the polymers using the droplet freezing technique in
the immersion freezing mode.30,31 First, we placed 20 mg of each polymer sample into a clean
glass vial, followed by the addition of 10 ml of ultra-pure water (Nuclease-Free Water for
Molecular Biology; Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) to create a stock suspension. Next, we

sonicated the samples for 5 min to disperse the microparticles in the ultra-pure water. For ice
nucleation measurements, we first cleaned three siliconized glass slides (18 mm, HR3-239;
Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) with MilliQ water (specific resistivity ≥ 17.5 MΩ/cm,
25°C; produced with Millipore® SAS SIMSV001, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and
then dried them with purified air before placing them on a cooling stage (Grant Asymptote EF600
freezer; Grant Instruments (Cambridge) Ltd, Durham, UK). As previously reported,32 the
uncertainty of the temperature measurements with this droplet freezing technique is ±0.25°C. For
each ice nucleation measurement, we pipetted approximately 60 droplets with a volume of 1 µL
onto the glass slides. A chamber sealed the cooling stage, and a nitrogen flow of 0.2 L/min
prevented condensation during cooling. The nitrogen flow exerts no influence on the freezing
temperature.31 The cold stage gradually cooled from 20°C to -30°C at a rate of 3°C/min. A camera
located on the top of the chamber allowed for the real-time monitoring of the freezing process. A
schematic image of the droplet freezing technique used in this study is shown in the Supplement
Information, Figure S2. Employing a MATLAB script 33, we determined the freezing temperature
of each droplet from the recorded video, which we then used to calculate the fraction of frozen
droplets (𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑒 (𝑇), Equation 1):
𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑒 (𝑇) =

𝑁𝑓 (𝑇)
𝑁0

(1)

where 𝑁𝑓 (𝑇) represents the number of frozen droplets in an experiment at temperature 𝑇 and 𝑁0
the total number of droplets in an experiment.
To normalize the freezing data to the mass or surface area of the microplastics and facilitate
comparison with existing literature, we calculated the number of nucleation sites per unit mass,
𝑛𝑚 (𝑇) (Equation 2) and per surface area, 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇) (Equation 3).

𝑉𝑑 depicts the volume of an individual droplet, 𝑚 gives the reciprocal of the mass concentration of

To obtain the specific surface area of the unaged particles, we analyzed the SEM images and
utilized ImageJ for all samples except for PP-needlesc. By using the ImageJ software, we measured
the diameter (and in case of fibers also the length) of at least 100 particles per sample and
calculated the corresponding surface area. For these calculations, we approximated particles as
spherical and fibers as cylinders. For PP-needlesc, characterized by dense, hay-like features (see
Figure 1a), we employed N2 sorption measurements on an ASAP 2020 gas sorption instrument
(Micromeritics) to obtain the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area34, since
obtaining identifiable, individual particles from SEM images was challenging. Before analysis, the
sample was degassed for 9 h at 90°C. We collected N2 sorption data at 77 K in the relative pressure
range of 0-1 (saturation pressure 1 atm), and calculated the BET surface area using the BETSI
software package.35

Oxidation Experiments
Microplastics samples underwent exposure to O3 in a rotating-wall flow-tube reactor (see
Supplement Information, Figure S3).36 A few milligrams of each microplastic sample was placed
within a glass tube that was inserted inside the flow-tube reactor. The glass tube was then rotated
at a fixed rate with a motor to ensure constant mixing. An ozone generator (Jelight, model: 600)
produced O3 outside the flow cell. The output from the ozone generator (2 L/min) flowed through
the flow-tube reactor containing the microplastic samples. At the outlet, an O3 monitor (Thermo

Scientific, 49i) continuously monitored the O3 concentration. We set the exposure duration for the
microplastic samples at 2 h and used an O3 concentrations of 2.8 ppmv. Background concentrations
of O3 in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) are around 30 ppbv.37 Assuming that the aging of
microplastic surfaces is proportional to both concentration and time, the exposures in our
experiment correspond to 7.7 days at 30 ppbv.
In addition, we performed aging experiments using a commercial UV-ozone cleaning device
(ProCleaner™, Bioforce Nanosciences). We put a thin layer of each microplastic sample onto the
sample stage within the oxidation chamber. The cleaning device generates UVC light (185 nm and
254 nm) using a mercury lamp. Figure S4 in the Supplement Information depicts the irradiance
spectrum of the mercury lamp used in the chamber. Also, 185 nm light generates O atoms and O3
by reactions (1) and (2)38:
O2 + hν(185 nm) → 2 O( 3P)

(1)

O( 3P) + O2 + M → O3 + M

(2)

In addition, 254 nm light generates hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the presence of water vapor by
reactions (3) and (4)38,39:
O3 + hν(254 nm) → O( 1D) + O2

(3)

O( 1D) + H2 O → 2 ∙ OH

(4)

For logistical reasons, we exposed the microplastics to these aging conditions for 2 h. To ensure
uniform treatment of light and O3 throughout the entire sample, we opened the chamber every
approx. 15 min, and thoroughly mixed the samples manually. O3 concentrations generated in these
experiments reached 5.9 ppmv. The O3 exposures in these experiments correspond to 16.3 days at
30 ppbv (background PBL concentrations). The exposure to 185 nm and 254 nm light in these
experiments are upper limits to exposure in the troposphere, since most of these wavelengths are

filtered out by the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The OH concentrations in these experiments
were not measured. However, using the same wavelengths and a similar configuration, OH
concentrations of two or three orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the atmosphere
can be produced.40 Assuming OH concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than ambient,
the OH exposures correspond to roughly 200 hours or 8.3 days under ambient conditions. Until
additional data is available, these aging experiments with UVC and O3, should be considered as
upper limits to aging in the troposphere. Additional studies are needed with a combination of UV
and O3 exposures typical of the troposphere.
Following both oxidation experiments, we transferred 20 mg from each treated microplastics
sample into a sterile glass tube, added 10 ml of ultra-pure water, sonicated for a duration of 5 min,
and then measured ice nucleation activity (triplicates at minimum).

Results and Discussion
Freezing results for unaged microplastics
Freezing curves in Figure 2 reveal that three suspensions of microplastic samples (PP-needlesc,
PP-fibersb, and PET-fibersb) froze at temperatures above the water blank, indicating a
heterogeneous freezing process. The T50 (i.e. the temperature at which 50 % of the droplets were
frozen) values for these three suspensions were -20.88°C ± 0.52 for PP-needlesc, -23.24°C ± 0.21
for PP-fibersb, and -21.93°C ± 0.51 for PET-fibersb, compared to -25.78°C ± 1.21 for the water
blank. Table 2 summarizes all T50-values including 83% confidence intervals. Two datasets are
statistically distinct with a 95% confidence level if their respective 83% confidence bands do not
overlap.41

(PET) spheresc and fibersb, and (c) polyethylene (PE) spheresc and flakesb. In all plots the water blank is depicted in
grey. The error bars of the samples and blank represent the 83% confidence interval. Two datasets are statistically
distinct with a 95% confidence level if their respective 83% confidence bands do not overlap.41 Experiments were
performed in triplicate at minimum.

The freezing curves of PP-spheresc, PET-spheresc, PE-spheresc, and PE-flakesb fall within the
confidence interval of the water blank freezing curve and are therefore not distinguishable from
the background. However, the freezing curves of these plastic samples deviate from the mean of
the blank at fraction frozen values close to 1, which could indicate that some heterogeneous activity
may exist. Given that freezing of the water background in µL-sized droplet freezing assays, as
used in this study, is typically around -25°C31, evaluating particle-induced freezing below this
temperature would require an alternative assay using droplets in the nL range, where background
freezing occurs around -35°C.42
To normalize the freezing data to the mass and surface area and compare our data with the
literature, we determined the number of nucleation sites per unit mass, 𝑛𝑚 (𝑇), and surface area,
𝑛𝑠 (𝑇), (Figure 3). The 𝑛𝑚 (𝑇) values of the different ice-active microplastics samples agree within
about one order of magnitude and increase roughly exponentially as temperature decreases (Figure
3a). At -18°C the values range from 7.2 x 104 to 1.5 x 105 g-1, and at -22°C the values range from
9.0 x 105 to 1.3 x 107 g-1. The following order was observed at a freezing temperature of -22°C:
PP-needlesc > PET-fibersb > PP-fibersb. The 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇) values of all ice-active microplastics agree
within about two orders of magnitude and increased roughly exponentially with decreasing
temperature (Figure 3b). At -18°C the 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇) values range from 4.5 x 10-1 to 8.7 x 101 cm-2, and

at -22 °C the values range from 8.0 x 101 to 2.1 x 103 cm-2. In general, the following order was
observed PET-fibersb  PP-fibersb > PP-needlesc.
Comparison of the freezing results and physicochemical properties.
Several physical and chemical properties can influence freezing properties. These include
polymer type, crystallinity, morphology, mechanical grinding, and the presence of oxygencontaining functional groups. Below, we discuss each of these properties in detail.
Polymer type alone is insufficient to predict freezing results. For example, PP-fibersb had higher
𝑛𝑠 (𝑇)-values than PP-needlesc. On the other hand, crystallinity may be important, as previous
studies have shown that porous organic polymers of higher crystallinity exhibit greater ice
nucleation efficiency.28 PP can exist in different structural forms (atactic, syndiotactic, isotactic),
which affect crystallinity. Thus, differences in crystallinity could explain variations in ice
nucleation behavior among PP samples. The morphology of microplastics also appears to be
important. Both fiber samples (PP-fibersb and PET-fibersb) showed the highest 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇)-values,
suggesting morphology may have a role in ice nucleation. However, PP-needlesc also nucleated
ice, indicating morphology alone is not the sole predictor.
Oxygen-containing functional groups on microplastic surfaces may also promote ice nucleation
through hydrogen bonding. FTIR analysis (Figure S1) revealed that PP-needlesc had such groups
(i.e. O-H and O-O-H stretching vibrations between 3300 and 3100 cm-1, C=O stretching between
1550 and 1700 cm-1), potentially explaining their higher nucleation temperatures. However, a clear
relationship between oxygen content and ice nucleation ability was not observed across all
samples. For instance, PET-spheresc had high oxygen content (see chemical structure in Figure 1
and FTIR spectrum in Figure S1) but did not induce ice nucleation.

Mechanical grinding can also influence ice nucleation by altering surface functional groups.
Two of three ice-active microplastics were from commercial product breakdown (PP-fibersb and
PET-fibersb), suggesting breakdown and grinding may have generated nucleation sites in these
samples. However, PE-flakesb did not show ice activity, indicating grinding is not the sole factor.
In summary, the freezing properties of the microplastics studied appear to be influenced by a
combination of factors, possibly including crystallinity, morphology, oxygen-containing
functional groups, and mechanical grinding.

Comparison of the freezing results for unaged microplastics with literature data
Ganguly and Ariya18 synthesized three microplastics types (PP, low-density PE, and highdensity PE) in the laboratory and quantified their freezing properties using a droplet freezing
technique. In Figure 3a, we have compared our freezing results with their PP microplastics. Our
observed 𝑛𝑚 (𝑇) data are lower than the literature values by 1-4 orders of magnitude for freezing
temperatures between -16 and -22°C. In addition, we calculated 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇) values by computing them
from the 𝑛𝑚 (𝑇) values reported by Ganguly and Ariya18 using an average diameter of 193 nm for
their microplastics, which corresponds with their own measurements. Using this approach, the
calculated 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇) values based on the data from Ganguly and Ariya18 closely match our
microplastics data (Figure 3b). This suggests that the difference in 𝑛𝑚 (𝑇) values between our
study and Ganguly and Ariya18 can be attributed to differences in the surface area used in the
experiments, rather than a significant variance in the ice nucleation ability per unit surface area.
Teska et al.29 showed that microplastic fibers from clothing textiles are effective ice nuclei with
ice nucleation onset temperatures between –6 to –9 °C and 𝑛𝑚 (𝑇)-values between 0.2 to 3 mg-1.
Their measurements also showed that ice nucleation was biological in origin, which may explain
the higher onset temperatures, compared to the current study.
To help put the freezing ability of microplastics into atmospheric context, the ice nucleation
active surface-site densities, 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇), of the PP-needlesc, PP-fibersb, and PET-fibersb were compared
to those for volcanic ash45, fungal spores6,47, NX-illite46, K-feldspar43, and a natural mineral dust44
parameterizations (see Figure 3b). The ice nucleation properties of mineral dust and volcanic ash
have been the focus of many studies, and both represent important types of INPs in the atmosphere.

Fungal spores have been found in atmospheric aerosol and cloud water samples and are moderately
effective INPs.51 In addition, fungal spores and microplastics can have similar sizes, and the impact
of ice nucleation by fungal spores on their long-range transport and atmospheric concentrations
and distributions has been investigated.6 Figure 3b shows that 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇)-values for PP-needlesc, PPfibersb, and PET-fibersb are comparable to those for volcanic ash, NX-illite and fungal spores. On
the other hand, 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇) values for the same microplastics are approximately 2-3 orders of magnitude
lower than those for K-feldspar and a parameterization for natural mineral dust. K-feldspar and
natural mineral dust are considered highly effective INPs.
The relative importance of different INP types in the atmosphere will depend on both the 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇)values (e.g. Figure 3b) and their atmospheric concentrations. For most conditions in the
atmosphere, the concentrations of microplastics are likely far less than the concentrations of
mineral dust particles (see Aeschlimann et al.19 and references therein). Regions where
microplastic INPs will be important will be limited to regions where microplastic concentrations
are very high or when concentrations of mineral dust particles are low, such as over the Southern
Ocean.19 The concentrations of microplastics in the atmosphere may also increase in the future as
their atmospheric sources increase. The 𝑛𝑠 (𝑇)-values included here provide information for
calculating the relative importance of microplastic INPs in the atmosphere, now and in the future.
Possible effects of unaged microplastics on clouds and long-range transport.
A recent study by González-Pleiter et al.52 showed that microplastics, specifically polymer
fragments and artificial fibers, can accumulate to concentrations reaching up to 0.032 L-1 in the
PBL (planetary boundary layer) above urban areas.46 The identified fibers exhibited an average
length and width of 662 µm and 25.4 µm, respectively, similar to PP-fibersb in our study. To

provide an initial assessment of the potential impact of microplastics on clouds, we combined the
upper limit of microplastics concentrations reported by González-Pleiter et al.52 (0.032 L-1) and
our freezing results for the PP-fibersb. First, we calculated the number of ice nucleation sites per
fiber at a freezing temperature of -20°C using the freezing data for PP-fibersb and the following
equation:
𝐼𝑁 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑓𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟(−20°𝐶) =

− ln(1 − 𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑒 (−20°𝐶)) 𝑓𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠
÷
𝑉𝑑
𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡

(4)

𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡 was determined based on the average volume of the individual PP-fibersb and
a density of 0.90 g/cm3.54 The calculation using Equation 4 gave 0.15 ice nucleation sites per fiber
at -20°C. Next, we used this value along with the microplastic concentrations reported by
González-Pleiter et al.52 (0.032 L-1) to estimate an INP concentration of 0.005 L-1 of air at a
freezing temperature of -20 °C. Previous studies have shown that an INP concentration of 0.01 L1

of air at -20°C can be sufficient to influence cloud glaciation.55 Hence, we conclude that in some

situations the concentrations of microplastics may be high enough to cause cloud glaciation.
However, this analysis did not consider the presence of mineral dust INPs and biological INPs in
the atmosphere. The concentrations of mineral dust and biological particles are likely higher than
the concentrations of microplastics for most atmospheric conditions, and mineral dust and
biological INPs can cause ice nucleation at warmer temperatures than microplastic INPs. These
combined effects will likely limit the effect of microplastics INPs on cloud glaciation for most
atmospheric conditions. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to consider these competing
effects.
If the microplastics nucleate ice (as shown here for certain types of microplastics), ice nucleation
followed by precipitation can also affect their long-range transport to faraway regions and their
atmospheric concentrations and distributions. Recent simulations using a global chemistry-climate

transport model showed that ice nucleation by fungal spores followed by precipitation,
significantly impacted their long-range transport and concentrations in remote regions and the
upper troposphere.6 The size of fungal spores ranges from 2 to 50 µm.56 Since some microplastics
have similar 𝑛𝑠 -values to fungal spores (Figure 3b), and may have similar sizes to some fungal
spores, ice nucleation by microplastics may influence their long-range transport and concentrations
in remote regions and the upper troposphere under some atmospheric conditions, such as when
mineral dust and biological INP concentrations are low. The freezing data included here provide
necessary information for including this phenomenon into atmospheric models.
Freezing results for aged microplastics
When suspended in the air, microplastics undergo atmospheric aging due to exposure to oxidants
(e.g. O3) and UV light, which can change their chemical and physical properties, including ice
nucleating properties. To investigate the effect of atmospheric aging on the ice nucleation activity
of microplastics, we exposed the microplastics to O3 using a flow-tube reactor and measured the
change in ice activity. The O3 exposures in our experiments corresponded to 16.3 days at 30 ppbv
(background PBL conditions). We also conducted UVC+O3 experiments, which represented an
upper limit to photooxidation in the troposphere. Figure 4 shows the freezing curves in the form
of boxplots before and after the aging experiments, and Table 2 summarizes all T50 values
including 83% confidence intervals before and after oxidation experiments.

Overall, exposure to O3 or UVC+O3 (referred to as photooxidation hereafter) either caused no
change (i.e. the change was less than the uncertainties of the measurements) or a decrease in ice
nucleation activity. For the non-ice nucleation active plastics (PP-spheresc, PET-spheresc, PEspheresc, PE-flakesb) no statistically significant change in ice nucleation activity was observed
after exposure to O3 or photooxidation. A similar result was observed for the ice-active sample
PP-fibersb (i.e. no change was observed). On the other hand, for the ice nucleation active samples
PP-needlesc and PET-fibersb, nucleation temperatures decreased slightly after exposure to O3 and
more strongly after photooxidation.
We conclude that atmospheric aging due to O3 exposure and photooxidation can lead to a
reduction in the ice nucleation ability of some microplastics, but not all. These findings align with
previous studies demonstrating that exposure of some atmospherically relevant organic particles

and material, such as lignin57 and pollen58, to O3 or other oxidants leads to either no change or a
decrease in ice nucleation ability. Furthermore, some studies also showed that soot particles aged
with O3 also did not show enhanced ice nucleation ability.59,60 However, Gorbunov et al.61 and
Gao & Kanji62 reported contradictory results. Additionally, a study on inorganic mineral dusts
(Arizona test dust and kaolinite) has revealed an enhancement in ice nucleation ability after
exposure to O3.63
We employed FTIR and SEM measurements to track chemical and morphological alterations
due to exposure to O3 and photooxidation. FTIR spectra with peak assignments, and SEM images
for all samples before and after oxidation experiments are provided in the Supplement Information
(Figure S5–S7 and Table S2–S3 for FTIR; Figure S8–S10 for SEM). Table 3 summarize the
observed changes in the chemical and physical properties of the ice-active microplastics (PPfibersb, PP-needlesc, and PET-fibersb) due to exposure to O3 and photooxidation. The change in
ice nucleation activity with O3 exposure and photooxidation are also included in Table 3 for
comparison purposes.
O3 exposure did not cause a detectable change in the chemical or morphological properties of
the ice-active microplastics (PP-fibersb, PP-needlesc, and PET-fibersb) (Table 3, column 3 and
column 4). On the other hand, O3 exposure caused a decrease in ice nucleation ability of the PPneedlesc and PET-fibersb (Table 3, column 2). We conclude that O3 exposure must have caused
some chemical and/or physical changes at the surface of the PP-needlesc and PET-fibersb that were
not detected with FTIR or SEM measurements. Future studies that use surface-focused analytical
techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for example, are needed to understand the
relationship between O3 exposure and ice nucleation ability of microplastics.

Photooxidation caused an increase in oxygen-containing functional groups for PP-needlesc and
PP-fibersb, but not PET-fibersb (Table 3, column 6). Post-photooxidation FTIR data revealed a
new band at 1720 cm⁻¹, corresponding to C=O stretching vibrations, in PP-needlesc. Additionally,
the FTIR data for PP-fibersb showed C=O stretching vibrations between 1500 and 1720 cm⁻¹, O–
H and O‒O‒H stretching vibrations between 3300 and 3100 cm⁻¹, and peaks in the 1300 to 650
cm⁻¹ region, attributed to C–O–C or O–O stretches64. Photooxidation caused a decrease in ice
nucleation activity for PP-needlesc and PET-fibersb, but not PP-fibers (Table 3, column 2). We
conclude that the decrease in ice nucleation ability caused by photooxidation cannot be explained
by just the increase in oxygen-containing functional groups observed with FTIR spectroscopy.
Photooxidation also caused a change in morphology (formation of cracks) for PP-fibersb, but not
PP-needlesc and PET-fibersb (Table 3, column 7). We conclude that the decrease in ice nucleation
ability caused by photooxidation cannot be explained by just a change in morphology observed
with SEM as there was no observed relationship between the change in ice nucleation activity and
change in morphology. These results also underscore the need for surface-sensitive analytical
techniques to explain the relationship between photooxidation and ice nucleation ability of
microplastics. Related, Teska et al.29 showed that fibers from clothing textiles (including PET
fibers) can carry biological ice nucleating material. If our samples also possess such material,
photooxidation may have degraded this film, potentially leading to the observed decrease in
nucleation temperature.

The influence of microplastics on atmospheric processes, notably their potential influence on ice
nucleation in clouds, remains a subject of uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that certain
microplastic samples, specifically PP-needlesc, PP-fibersb, and PET-fibersb heterogeneously
nucleate ice in the immersion freezing mode at temperatures between -15 and -25°C and have
𝑛𝑠 (𝑇)-values similar to fungal spores and volcanic ash. The ability of microplastics to freeze at
these relatively warm temperatures suggests they can be removed from the atmosphere by ice
nucleation followed by precipitation, which may modify their long-range transport to faraway
regions and their distributions throughout the atmosphere. Our results are consistent with field
measurements by Kozjek et al.65 who observed fibrous microplastics inside hailstones.65
Exposure to O3 and UVC+O3 led to a reduction in nucleation temperature for two (PP-needlesc
and PP-fibersb) out of the three ice-active microplastics.
Since the mid-20th century, our environment has been increasingly inundated with plastics.
Considering the time lag from the release of plastics into the environment to their gradual

transformation into microplastics, it is likely that the concentration of microplastics will continue
to rise in the future and play a more significant role in ice formation in the atmosphere.

Supporting Information
SEM measurements: Each dry microplastic sample was deposited on individual aluminum
SEM stubs (25 mm diameters, Item 1614-9, TED PELLA) coated with an adhesive carbon tape.
To ensure proper particle distribution throughout the stub, approx. 1 mg of each sample was
dispersed with a micro-spatula onto a glass slide and picked up by gently pressing the stub with
the carbon tape against the slide and picking up adhered particles. Afterwards, samples’ stubs were
sputter coated with 10 nm Iridium using an EM MED020 Coating System (Leica). Imaging was
recorded with a Scanning Electron Microscope SU3500 (Hitachi) using a secondary electron
detector. Images were acquired using a 1.5 kV acceleration voltage, except for PP-needlesc after
O3 and UVC+O3, for which a 10 kV acceleration voltage was employed.
