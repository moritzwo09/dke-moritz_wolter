Abstract
Energy production from subsurface reservoirs perturbs the equilibrium between fluids and the
surrounding rocks. As the saturation increases, nucleation begins, forming a scale that is
detrimental to production. Inhibitor addition for scale prevention is a common practice with
significant economic and environmental costs. Traditional experiments to determine induction
times (tind) and evaluate inhibitor efficiency are performed under constant oversaturation.
Similarly, constant oversaturation is used in both the empirical and the classical nucleation theory
modeling schemes used for scale prediction. Subsequently, experiments and models do not address
the dynamic nature of oversaturation increase during energy production.
We developed an experimental system for quantitative investigation of nucleation kinetics
under a regime of dynamic oversaturation and a simple algorithm for determining tind from laser
measurements. Using our system, we studied the precipitation kinetics of CaCO3 minerals at a pH
of ~6.76, ionic strength of I = 1m, temperature range of 50-90 oC, and varying rates of
oversaturation increase. We quantified the effect of a potent inhibitor (Polyamino Polyether
Methylene Phosphonate; PAPEMP) on the tind and the forming solid phase. Finally, we developed
a numerical model that explicitly accounts for the dynamic nature of oversaturation.
Here, we present our experimental system, results, and modeling scheme. We show that
for a given set of conditions, calcite induction occurs at a similar oversaturation, regardless of the
rate at which oversaturation increases. Moreover, we show that PAPEMP retards CaCO3
nucleation at below ppm levels and that it has a temperature-dependent effect on polymorphism.
Lastly, we suggest that expanding existing models such that:
𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 𝑓(∆𝑆𝐼) ∗ 𝑓(𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐)
Where f(ΔSI) is a function of oversaturation with time and f(static) are existing modeling schemes,
adequately describe the dynamic nature of oversaturation and show a form of f(ΔSI) that provides
an excellent fit with measured tind.

1. Introduction
Subsurface brines and fluids become supersaturated and precipitate minerals during energy
production from hydrocarbon and hydrothermal reservoirs. The precipitation of these minerals
causes scale formation that is detrimental to production. Scaling clogs pipes, damages machinery,
and reduces the porosity and permeability of reservoir rocks (Kamal et al., 2018; Regenspurg et
al., 2015). Carbonate and sulfate minerals are the most common scale-forming minerals, with
calcite being the most abundant.
Adding scale inhibitors to prevent precipitation is a routine practice during energy
production. Typical scale inhibitors are organic molecules with either phosphonate, sulfonate, or
carboxylate functional groups. The addition of these chemicals, even at ppm levels and below,
retards precipitation (Reiss et al., 2020), alters crystal habit (Reiss et al., 2020; Weber et al., 2016),
and changes the mineral phase by stabilizing less-stable polymorphs (Gopi et al., 2013; Gopi and
Subramanian, 2012; Sanjiv Raj et al., 2021). Subsequently, much effort has been directed towards
determining inhibitor impact on kinetics, habit, and polymorph selection.
Traditionally, the interplay between inhibitors and nucleation kinetics is studied under
static setups where the initial conditions of the fluid phase are constant until crystal nucleation and
growth alter the chemistry. However, during energy production from geological reservoirs, the
saturation with respect to scale-forming minerals changes due to several possible processes such
as degassing and changes in pH, temperature changes, evaporation, mixing of brines, etc.
Subsequently, contrary to static experimental setups, scale formation during energy production
occurs under increasing saturation.
Filed observations show that fluids being concentrated and becoming oversaturated can
remain metastable towards several mineral phases for extended durations before an oversaturation
threshold is passed and nucleation begins (Rosenberg et al., 2018). The width of the ‘metastable
zone’ (i.e., the difference between equilibrium and oversaturation at which nucleation occurs), is
key for controlling industrial crystallization and the impact the rate of oversaturation increases due
to various temperature gradients in crystallizers is extensively studied (Duroudier, 2016). It was
found that for low-temperature gradients, the width of the metastable zone for highly soluble salts
(e.g., KCl and NaCl) depends on the temperature gradient (up to several oC/h) (Nývlt, 1968).
However, under temperature gradients that are typical of energy production and beyond (e.g., ≥
0.5 oC/min), the width of the metastable zone is insensitive to the gradient and →0 (i.e., crystal
formation is immediate) (Navarathna et al., 2023).
The impact of the saturation increase rate on the width of the metastability zone for
gypsum, barite, and some carbonate phases (witherite, strontianite) where previously determined
for diffusion-controlled systems at ambient temperatures (Prieto et al., 1994). These experiments
found a dependency between the rate of saturation increase and the oversaturation at which the
nucleation occurs. However, due to the slow rate of diffusion and subsequent long induction times
(weeks to months) compared to the duration of fluid transport and induction during energy
production (typically up to a couple of hours) these results are not directly applicable to energy
production scenarios.

Identifying the oversaturation at which nucleation will occur during energy production will
provide an improved assessment of scaling risk and be utilized for adjusting mitigation strategies.
However, to date, the impact of the rate of the saturation increase on the nucleation kinetics and
the values of oversaturation at which nucleation occurs have not been determined for major scaleforming minerals under conditions that are relevant for energy production. More importantly,
current models of nucleation kinetics and induction time prediction for these conditions are derived
and validated from static experiments (see discussion in section 4.4.1). Quantitatively determining
the impact of dynamic saturation on the nucleation kinetics under relevant conditions for the major
scale-forming minerals and developing modeling schemes to represent these effects will be a step
forward for scale prediction and control.
Contrary to the kinetics, inhibitor impact on polymorphism and crystal habit is often
derived from dynamic systems where SI is gradually increased by titrations, fluid injection,
degassing, or applying a temperature gradient (Gopi et al., 2013; Gopi and Subramanian, 2012;
Nicoleau et al., 2019; Sanjiv Raj et al., 2021). Subsequently, the information on nucleation
kinetics, crystal habit, and polymorph selection are often obtained under different conditions.
The goal of this research was to study CaCO3 nucleation and inhibition under increasing
saturation. Specifically, we aimed to 1. Develop a simple apparatus and workflow that will enable:
a) a quantitative study of CaCO3 precipitation at the slightly acidic to acidic conditions prevailing
in many subsurface reservoirs from which hydrocarbons (Dai et al., 2022a) or hydrothermal fluids
(Utami et al., 2014) are produced; b. allow for a simple, accurate, determination of nucleation
kinetics with high reproducibility; and c) determine the CaCO3 polymorph alongside the kinetics.
2. Derive a quantitative model for predicting induction times under increasing SI under conditions
that are relevant to energy production.
2. Methodology
2.1 Brine preparation
Brines for the experiments were made with analytical grade CaCl2*2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), NaCl
(Sigma-Aldrich), NaHCO3 (Fischer Chemical), 1N HCl (Fischer Chemical), and Double deionized
water (DDW; resistivity of 18 ohm/cm). The inhibitor used is a commercially available product
with 48-52% Polyamino Polyether Methylene Phosphonic Acid (PAPEMP) active ingredient.
Three brines were used in each experiment, cationic brine, anionic brine, and reaction cell brine.
The reaction cell brine was a 1 m NaCl solution. The anionic brine contained 0.12 m NaHCO3
with NaCl to adjust the ionic strength to 1 m. The cationic brine contained 0.24 m CaCl2 with NaCl
to adjust the ionic strength to 1 m. HCl was added to the cationic brine to maintain the pH during
the duration in which the mixed brine in the reaction cell is oversaturated during the experiments
within ±0.03 units. The amount of acid to add was calculated with Rice Universities
ScaleSoftPitzer (SSP) software package (see thermodynamic calculations section 2.3).
In the inhibitor-containing experiments, PAPEMP was added to the reaction cell and
anionic brines. The concentration of the inhibitor in the anionic brine was double the concentration

in the reaction cell so that when the anionic and cationic brines were injected into the reaction cell
(see experimental setup section 2.2) the inhibitor concentration remained constant.
2.2 Experimental setup
Figure 1 depicts the experimental system. The reaction cell is a customized ACE heavy-walled
glass tub with a PTFE cap. Three holes were drilled through the cap to enable tubing for the inflow
of the ionic brines and effluent outflow. The framework of the experimental system is a GC oven
that was placed above a magnetic stirrer. The magnets on the stirrer were replaced by strong rare
earth magnets enabling stirring fluids in the reaction cell inside of the oven. Two holes were drilled
into the oven opposite each other. The reaction cell was fixed between the two drillings with an
apparatus specifically designed for this purpose. A green laser source and a photodiode were
situated on opposite sides of the oven, near the two drillings, so that the laser beam traveling
between the source and photodiode passed through the reaction cell. The photodiode was
connected to a signal amplifier and a data logger was used for recording the laser intensity at
intervals of one second. An additional inlet, drilled in the side of the oven, was used for connecting
the reaction cell and the ionic reservoirs situated outside the oven. The cationic and anionic
reservoirs were 50 ml plastic syringes. These syringes were placed on top of a KD programmable
double syringe pump. The effluent flowed out of the reaction cell via an additional tube connected
through an opening at the top of the oven. To prevent degassing and CO2 escape, the effluent tube
was connected to a 20 PSI backpressure regulator.
We conducted experiments with a mass exchange rate, kw, (kw = Q/Vcell) of 0.53 at 50,
70, and 90 oC. Plots of SI in time for all mass exchange rates and temperatures are presented in
supplementary 1 datafile. At each temperature we performed experiments with 0, 0.25, 0.5, and
0.7 ppm PAPEMP. In addition, to test the effect of the rate at which SI changes, we performed
experiments at 90 oC (0 and 0.5 ppm inhibitor) under three additional flow rates that produced
mass transfer coefficients of 0.38, 0.8, and 1.15. The pH during the 50 oC and 70 oC experiments
was 6.78 and 6.76 for the 90 oC experiments. We performed at least three experiments under each
combination of T, mass transfer coefficient, and inhibitor concentration. For A total of 79
experiments

Figure 1. The experimental setup.
The end of each experiment was determined by a change in laser intensity. At the end of each
experiment, the crystals were separated from the solution by filtration using 0.45 μm dark filter
Wahtman paper. XRD (Rigaku D/Max ultima II powder XRD and PDXL database) and SEM (FEI
Quanta 400 ESEM) were used to determine the precipitating polymorph and imaging the crystals.
2.3 Thermodynamic calculations
The Pitzer model was used to calculate the amount of acid inflow to maintain pH, and the saturation
index (SI, equation 1) throughout the experiment. Pitzer’s model is incorporated into several
software packages (e.g., PHREEQC, Geochemist Workbench, etc), however, calculated SI varies
between them and it is necessary to select a software package and thermodynamic database that
was verified to fit the experimental conditions (Reiss et al., 2021). Here, we used the Rice SSP
software package. SSP is specifically designed for calculating the thermodynamic properties of
brines at elevated temperatures and was verified to be accurate for CaCO3 polymorphs under the
conditions of our experiments (Dai et al., 2017).

4. Discussion
4.1 A simple algorithm for determining tind from laser measurements
The induction time (tind) is defined as the time laps between the creation of supersaturation (i.e.,
SI > 0) and the appearance of the nucleating phase. The ability to identify the appearance of crystals
is method specific and tind for a given system varies with techniques. Using the interference to light
travelling through a reaction cell following crystal formation is a simple way for continuously
monitoring for mineralization. Due to its simplicity, compatibility with any transparent reactor,
and easy application under a wide range of environmental conditions, using laser intensity as done
here is extremely useful for studying the nucleation kinetics of scale-forming minerals. However,
fluctuations in laser intensity is a challenge causing researchers to limit the use of this technique
to experiments with short induction times (Westin and Rasmuson, 2005). To overcome this
challenge, we fitted the measured laser intensity curve with a sigmoidal/logistic function (equation
2):

where a is the laser intensity before induction time, b is the lowest laser intensity value following
induction, t is time, c is the midpoint of the slope of the curve linking a and b, p is the curvature
(angle) between the pre-nucleation value of the laser and the downward sloping line immediately
after tind.
The fitting procedure produces a calculated laser intensity curve that is not affected by the
fluctuations in the laser source (Figure 2).

Figure 2. The measured VS. calculated laser intensity. The induction time is derived from the
calculated laser values that smooth out laser instability.
The induction time is the time where the intensity VS. time curve sufficiently shifts from
the pre-nucleation plateau. Mathematically, this is derived by inserting the c and p fitting
parameters from equation 2 into equation 3:

The criterion in equation 3 is a value that depends on the definition of sufficient shift from the
pre-nucleation plateau. It was recently suggested, based on the Mie light theory, that a 1%
change in laser intensity is sufficient to determine induction (Dai et al., 2019). Under such a
circumstance, the criterion would be 1/99 and equation 3 becomes:

Equation 4 is a robust mathematical form that overcomes the pre-nucleation fluctuations in laser
intensity and allows for a simple objective determination of tind in long experiments. A full
description of the algorithm we used is presented in appendix A.
4.2 Evaluating the experimental system
The average induction time and SI at induction for all the experimental conditions are provided in
Table 1. Comparing the induction times for the different temperatures, inhibitor concentrations,
and mass transfer rates shows that: the induction time at a given temperature and mass transfer rate
increases with inhibitor concentration, an inverse relationship exists between temperature and
induction time for all inhibitor concentrations (Figure 3a), and that the induction time is shortened
by faster increase in SI (Figure 3b). These trends agree with the general understanding of the role
the environmental parameters play in nucleation kinetics and serve as an initial qualitative test of
the system’s operation and the experimental results.
We performed a quotient rejection test, and contrary to the measured induction times that
vary widely with the rate of mass transfer, the SI at induction is similar at a 90% confidence level
for the different mass exchange rates (Figure 3c) indicating that the width of the metastable zone
is impervious to the oversaturation increase rate under the current experimental conditions.
Recently, similar behavior was reported for halite nucleation in a cooling system (without
inhibitors) where the induction time had an inverse relationship with the rate of cooling but the SI
value at induction was independent of the cooling rate (Navarathna et al., 2023). Such observations
are key for modeling nucleation kinetics in dynamic systems and are further discussed in section
4.4.2.

inhibitor and 0.5 ppm inhibitor. c) The SI at induction for the different values of kw with 0 and 0.5
ppm inhibitor. The solid lines are the average SI at induction and the dashed lines are ±8% of the
average, similar to the larger RSD on SI (table 1). A quotient rejection test shows that for a given
concentration of inhibitor and a 90% confidence, the SI is similar for all values of kw.
Quantitatively, the relative standard deviation (RSD) on the induction time and on the SI
is better than 10% and compare with RSD values reported from static experimental systems
(Rabizadeh, 2023). These results demonstrate that dynamic experimental setups, that better
represent actual conditions of scale formation, can be adopted without increasing the uncertainty
of the measured induction time. Consequently, the experimental design described above can be
adopted for studying nucleation under dynamic conditions and enables a simultaneous
determination of the kinetics, crystal habit, and polymorphism in a single experiment.

4.3 PAPEMP and CaCO3 Polymorphism
CaCO3 has three naturally occurring polymorphs with distinct morphology: rhombohedral
calcite, orthorhombic aragonite, and hexagonal vaterite. Crystal polymorphism, habit, and size
distribution determine the ability of the forming solid to adhere to surfaces, clog pipes, and
damage machinery and are therefore especially important in scaling processes. Generally,
elongated crystal habits are more prone to be detrimental to production (Glade et al., 2010; Mi &
Elimelech, 2010). Due to its importance, previous studies aimed to determine the impact
different inhibitors have on CaCO3 polymorphism and crystal habit (Didymus et al., 1993; Gopi
et al., 2013; Gopi and Subramanian, 2012; Sanjiv Raj et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2005; Weber et al., 2016). However, although PAPEMP has a high tolerance for calcium, is

effective at inhibiting both calcium carbonates and sulfates, is effective at both high and low pH
(Gill, 1999; Tang et al., 2008), and is the inhibitor of choice in major energy production
companies (personal communications with flow assurance engineers), very little research has
been done to determine this inhibitor’s effects on precipitation kinetics and polymorph selection.
The only previous work (to our knowledge) that specifically tested PAPEMP, found that
o
at 60 C (and unconstrained pH) this inhibitor does not affect the formed mineral assemblage
(Tang et al., 2008). In our study, where the pH, temperature, Ca2+/HCO3-, and ionic strength are
held constant until induction, only calcite was detected in the solutions with no inhibitor. The
addition of PAPEMP in concentrations of 0.25-0.7 ppm did not change the mineral assemblage
at 70 oC and 90 oC. However, at 50 oC, with PAPEMP, a mixture of vaterite and calcite
precipitated regardless of inhibitor concentration (Figure 4). Previous studies observed that the
addition of inhibitors will alter the CaCO3 mineral assemblage at some temperatures while not
affecting polymorphism at another temperature (Gopi et al., 2013; Gopi and Subramanian, 2012).
However, their experimental protocol consisted of gradually adding a bicarbonate solution to a
calcium solution so the pH and Ca2+/HCO3- ratio, both key for CaCO3 precipitation, were not
constrained. Subsequently, the addition of inhibitors might not be the only cause for the observed
change in polymorphs. The experimental system used in this study enables isolating the effect of
the inhibitor by maintaining a constant pH and Ca2+/HCO3- ratio. Therefore, our results
unequivocally demonstrate that the impact of PAPEMP on CaCO3 polymorph selection is
temperature dependent.

Observations of the pathway taken by dissolved Ca2+ and HCO3- ions to become calcite
suggest that this is a stepwise process starting with the formation of an amorphous calcium
carbonate (ACC) phase. The ACC then develops into vaterite that later transform to calcite via a
dissolution reprecipitation process (Rodriguez-Blanco et al., 2011). To date, the impact common
inhibitors have on this pathway are unknown. From our results we cannot conclude if at 50 oC
PAPEMP impedes the transformation of vaterite into calcite, or alternatively, that without
inhibitor calcite is the first phase to form and the addition of PAPEMP at 50 oC prevents its
formation and/or facilitates the nucleation of vaterite. However, whatever the mechanism is, our
results show that the effect of PAPEMP on CaCO3 are temperature dependent.
4.4 Towards modeling scale formation under dynamic conditions
4.4.1 Models for nucleation kinetics – the current state
Models of nucleation kinetics that can predict the induction time are useful for many processes in
natural environments, for interpreting mechanisms of geological and hydrogeological brine
development, and for engineering applications. Due to the wide importance of nucleation kinetics,
many studies have used induction times, derived from static experiments, to model the nucleation
kinetics under a wide range of conditions. The two common approaches taken to model the kinetics
are by using the framework of the classical nucleation theory (CNT), or by using a set of empirical
equations. According to the CNT, the rate of nucleation (Js) of a mineral depends on the
temperature, saturation state, and the interfacial tension, and is given by:

𝐽𝑠 = 𝐴𝑒𝑥𝑝

−

3
𝛽𝑉2
𝑚 𝜎 𝑁𝐴 𝑓(𝜃)
(𝑅𝑇)3 𝑙𝑛2 𝛺

(5

Where A is a pre-exponential factor, β is a shape factor, σ is the interfacial tension between the
solution and the forming crystal, Vm is the molar volume of the forming crystals, NA is Avogadro’s
number, f(θ) is a correction factor for heterogenous nucleation, R and T are the gas constant and
temperature and Ω is the saturation ratio.
In recent years, a growing number of experimental observations suggest that nucleation
of the common scale-forming minerals does not follow the classical path (for a discussion of
classical VS. non-classical nucleation the reader is referred to a recent textbook (Van Driessche
et al., 2017)). Whether calcite nucleation proceeds via a classical pathway is still being debated

(Smeets et al., 2017). However, while the theoretical validity of the classical theory to the
nucleation of calcite is still under debate, it is generally agreed that equation 5 provides a robust
mathematical framework for modeling nucleation whether the process is classical or not, and this
equation has been successfully incorporated into kinetic nucleation models (Dai et al., 2022b,
2019; Peters et al., 2024; Rendel et al., 2018; Reznik et al., 2012).
Although mathematically equation 5 can provide good agreement with experimental
observations it is often counter-productive for interpreting the impact of scale inhibitors. First,
literary values of the interfacial tension term (σ) for common scale-forming minerals span over
an order of magnitude or more (Dai et al., 2019; Reiss et al., 2021). This variety enables an
empirical selection of a value that fits the specific observations. More importantly, at the low
concentrations at which inhibitors are added (typically from below up to several ppm), the
complexation of lattice-building ions by inhibitors does not alter the saturation. Subsequently,
based on the CNT, inhibitor influence on the nucleation kinetics is often interpreted as being a
result of an increase in the interfacial energy (Curcio et al., 2010; Hasson et al., 2003; Van Der
Leeden et al., 1993; Vasina et al., 1996). However, as recently stated elsewhere, thermodynamic
considerations and measurements of contact angle between inhibitor-containing fluids and
mineral surfaces suggest the opposite (Nicoleau et al., 2019).
An alternative approach to model nucleation kinetics and the impact of inhibitors would
be to use empirical equations that do not pre-suppose a mechanism of nucleation and that are
independent of parameters, such as the interfacial tension term, that their values are uncertain
and their literary values widely vary. He et al., (He et al., 1996) developed a quantitative
framework for treating nucleation kinetics and the impact of inhibitors on induction times.
According to their formulation, the induction time with inhibitors is given by a nucleation
inhibition index (NII):

Where tind and to are respectively the induction time with and without inhibitor and Cinh is the
concentration of the inhibitor.
The induction times in equation 6 without inhibitor (t0) and b are empirically fitted from
experimental data such that:

Equation 9 is a general equation for the induction time as a function of SI, T, and inhibitor
concentration. This formulation has been adopted in multiple investigations of the impact of
inhibitors on nucleation kinetics and was found to accurately describe induction times for the
major scale forming minerals under a wide range of conditions (Dai et al., 2021; He et al., 1999,
1996; Zhao et al., 2021).
It should be pointed out that while many studies found equation 9 provides great
agreement with experimental data, it predicts that in the absence of an inhibitor (i.e., Cinh = 0),
the induction time is reduced to a non-zero constant as SI goes to infinity.
With their limitations described above, both CNT and empirical modeling schemes work
well for determining nucleation kinetics, providing insights into nucleation processes, and
predicting induction times under a wide range of conditions. In the following, we explore an
adaptation of the model to account for dynamic SI conditions.
4.4.2 A proposed model for tind under a regime of dynamic oversaturation
To adjust the existing models for dynamic conditions one needs to account for SI changing with
time. The SI values at induction are similar over the entire range of mass exchange (kw) tested in
this study and appear to only significantly change by the concentration of inhibitor (i.e., the
metastability zone is insensitive to the rate of SI increase but is influenced by the presence of an
inhibitor). Consequently, replacing SI (or Ω) in the static models with a time dependent SI
function would not allow for describing the system. Rather, one needs a functional form that
enables accounting for different induction times at a similar SI value for a given temperature and
inhibitor concentration. One possible solution to this conundrum is to model the induction time
with two terms, one term for the rate of nucleation as the function of the environmental
conditions (e.g., the static model) and an additional term accounting for the rate in which the SI
is changing. Under such a scheme, a functional form for modeling the induction time under a
changing SI is given by:
𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑑𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑐 = 𝑓(𝛥𝑆𝐼) ∗ 𝑓(𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐 )

(10

where f(tind.static) are one of the common static models (i.e., equations 5 or 9) and f(ΔSI) is a
function that accounts for the rate of increasing SI. In the current study, SI is increased by
injection of Ca2+ and HCO3- ions and the rate of increase depends on the rate of mass transfer.
For such a process, f(ΔSI) will take on the form:
𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑑𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑐 =

𝑘
𝑘𝑤

∗ 𝑓(𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐 )

Where k is a kinetic proportionality constant, and kw is the mass transfer coefficient. Substituting

We used a minimization scheme between the measured and predicted induction times for the 50
C and 90 oC experiments to derive the coefficients for the model. We then tested the model’s
predictions against the 70 oC experiments. Figure 5 shows a comparison between the measured
and calculated induction times and table 2 summarize the coefficients that provide the best fit
between the experimental data and the model predictions.

The difference between the measured induction times and the model predictions
compares with the uncertainty reported for experimental measurements of induction times. This
excellent agreement between the experiments and model indicate that the suggested modeling
scheme adequately describes induction times under varying SI as occurs during energy
production and other industrial processes (e.g., RO desalination).

While equation 12 accounts for the time variation in SI, it still suffers from the limitation
discussed above where at infinite SI the induction time does not reduce to zero. To address this
issue, we suggest using a power series over SI and T. In addition, the inhibitor term of the
equation (e.g., the b dependent term) can be adjusted to eliminate the somewhat unconventional

As before, the model was fitted with the 50 oC and 90 oC data sets and the 70 oC dataset
was only used for verification. Figure 6 shows the model predictions VS. the measured
observations. Overall, this model provides a good fit (R2 = 0.969). 86% of the predictions are
within 10% from the measured data points and all predictions are within 20%. It should be noted
that for all experimental conditions where a prediction exceeds 10%, other data points are below
that range. This is a result of the variation of the measured induction times. Equation 13 thus
provides an overall model for predicting induction times under increasing SI and that satisfies the
conditions that: when SI is infinitely large or small, tind would be infinitely the opposite.
As demonstrated here, it is possible to model induction times under increasing SI and
simultaneously treat the nucleation kinetics and polymorphism. Such a scheme is a step forward
toward modeling nucleation in natural and engineered environments where SI increases with
time.

4.4.3 Implications and prospective
Scale and its detrimental impact on production is costly. The inhibitors used to prevent scale
during energy production from hydrocarbon and hydrothermal reservoirs, and that are added
during desalination are not cheap. More importantly, halting production during energy extraction
for advanced scale prevention treatments (e.g., scale inhibitor squeeze) or to treat formed scale
has a significant monetary cost. In addition, scale inhibitors have a potentially high
environmental cost and some of the common inhibitors are forbidden for use by countries with
advanced environmental regulation (Mady et al., 2018). Improving models for predicting scale
formation can provide a better estimation of scaling risk and the development of prevention
procedures that would help mitigate the economic and environmental costs associated with this
phenomenon. The good fit between the experimental measurements and the models presented in
the previous section demonstrates that the modeling scheme proposed here provides a framework
for mathematically describing nucleation kinetics of scale-forming minerals under increasing SI.
However, one should consider that both the f(tind,static) and the f(ΔSI) term might need
adjustments to account for varying chemical and physical properties of the fluids for which scale
control is necessary.
The ratio between the lattice-building cation and anion of a mineral in solution has a
considerable effect on precipitation kinetics (Bracco et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2024; Ruiz-Agudo
et al., 2011) and crystal habit (Bracco et al., 2012; Mbogoro et al., 2017; Reiss et al., 2019). This
effect causes a wide variation in induction times for a given mineral under similar SI,
temperature, salinity, etc. Consequently, models of nucleation kinetics using both the CNT
(equation 5) and the empirical scheme (equation 6) discussed above had to address this by
adjusting the models to account for this (Dai et al., 2021; Peters et al., 2024). In addition, the

speciation of the active functional groups on the inhibitor between fully dissociated and fully
protonated are pH dependent. As a consequence, the retarding efficiency of inhibitors changes
with pH (He et al., 1994). As the goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of modeling
nucleation time under dynamic conditions, our focus was on varying SI with time and we
conducted experiments under constant Ca2+/HCO3- and pH and the f(tind,static) term in our model
(equation 13) does not explicitly address changes in these parameters.
In addition, during industrial activities where scale control is key for maintaining
production the f(ΔSI) term might be influenced by one or a combination of several processes.
These include changes in pressure, pH, temperature (will simultaneously increase and decrease
SI for different minerals), salinity, etc. Consequently, the f(ΔSI) term should be adjusted for
different production scenarios. The experimental system described here (section 2.2) allows for
an experimental determination of many of the conditions that can affect f(tind.static), f(ΔSI), or
both. The GC oven framework enables conducting experiments under a variety of both
decreasing or increasing temperature gradients. The inflow of cationic, anionic, or both fluids
can be adjusted to produce different Ca2+/HCO3- ratios, applying pH gradients, and different
salinities that can be held constant or vary during an experiment. Quantifying the effect of pH,
Ca2+/HCO3-, and temperature gradients, and incorporating these into the model is a goal of future
research. In addition, we are currently exploring the impact of the dynamic conditions on the
nucleation kinetics and metastability zone of the major sulfate-scale-forming minerals.
5. Summary
In this work, we present an experimental system for simultaneously quantifying the nucleation
kinetics and determining crystal habit and polymorph as SI increases, as happens during energy
production, desalination, and other industrial systems. With this system, we studied the
precipitation of CaCO3 at pH ~ 6.75, I = 1m, 50-90 oC, PAPEMP concentrations of 0-0.7 ppm, and
varying rates of increasing SI. We show that: 1. The metastability zone of calcite is independent
of the rate at which SI increases; 2. The metastability zone is increased by inhibitor; 3. PAPEMP
inhibits calcite nucleation at below ppm concentrations; and 4. PAPEMP has a temperaturedependent effect on the forming CaCO3 polymorph. Based on our data, we developed a simple
algorithm for determining induction time from laser measurements and a numerical model that
provides an excellent fit between the experimental and predicted induction times over the entire
range of temperatures, SI rate of increase, and concentration of PAPEMP.
