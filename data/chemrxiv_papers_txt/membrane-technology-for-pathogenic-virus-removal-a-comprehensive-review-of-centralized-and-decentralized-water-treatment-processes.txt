Abstract

12

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has once again drawn attention to the risks of pathogenic

13

viruses, as viruses can be transmitted through water environments, posing a threat to human

14

health. Membrane technology, as a novel, green, and effective water treatment process, has

15

been widely applied in the removal of pathogenic viruses from wastewater and drinking water.

16

However, compared to refined centralized water treatment processes in urban areas, rural areas

17

still lack effective water treatment strategies for decentralized water supply and drainage

18

systems. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the hazards and

19

transmission pathways of viruses, the mechanisms and influencing factors of virus removal by

20

membrane processes. Based on the characteristics of centralized and decentralized water

21

treatment systems, it further summarizes the application scenarios and effectiveness of the most

widely used membrane processes. We emphasize the need for context-specific development of

23

membrane-based water treatment processes tailored to urban or rural areas, addressing both

24

water supply and wastewater treatment processes, to ensure comprehensive public health safety

in water environments. In addition, this review also discusses several challenges that membrane

technology faces in virus removal, providing new insights for further research in membrane

processes.

1. Introduction

36

Pathogenic viruses in the water environment are a serious public health and safety concern,

37

because they can enter drinking water sources through surface runoff or municipal pipelines.1,

38

2

39

For example, enterovirus and norovirus can induce gastrointestinal illnesses, poliovirus and

40

zoster virus can lead to neurological disorders, and the recent COVID-19 virus has claimed

41

over a million lives.3-5 These viruses are widely distributed across the globe and can be

42

transmitted through the water environment, having caused numerous pandemics and

43

endangered the safety of billions of individuals worldwide.6 Today, in the centralized water

44

supply and drainage processes, disinfection has become an indispensable part of water

45

treatment technologies. The main strategies employed include: (1) direct killing of viruses by

46

oxidants such as O3, Cl2, ClO2, etc.; (2) coagulation and precipitation of viruses by flocculants

47

such as AlCl3, FeCl3, polyacrylamide (PAM), etc.; (3) destruction of the protein structure of

48

viruses by ultraviolet irradiation, etc.7-9 However, these disinfection strategies still come with

49

limitations, as they are restricted by (1) the secondary contamination of disinfection by-

50

products, (2) the economic costs of chemical agents, and (3) the long-term reliability of virus

51

inactivation during water treatment processes.9-11

When humans are exposed to pathogenic viruses, their physical well-being is compromised.

52
53

Membrane separation processes, as an emerging water treatment technology, with the

54

advantages such as efficient separation, energy savings, and low costs.12 They hold promising

55

prospects in the removal of viruses from water environment.13, 14 Among them, microfiltration

56

(MF, 0.1~10Î¼m), ultrafiltration (UF, 10~100nm), and nanofiltration (NF, 1~10nm) are

57

currently the most widely used membrane technologies.13-15 These processes retain viruses

58

larger than the membrane pore size on the influent side through the size exclusion effect, and

59

can further enhance the removal efficiency by forming a gelatinous cake layer.16-18 This

60

significantly reduces the quantity of viruses in the permeate, ensuring a low viral risk in the

61

water environment. Furthermore, membrane technology can serve as an independent water

62

treatment module, coupled with other processes to meet specific water quality requirements.

63

For instance, when there is a high quantity of microorganisms in the water environment (e.g.,

64

algae, bacteria, etc.), membrane fouling can be mitigated through pre-treatment processes such

65

as coagulation and sedimentation.19, 20 Similarly, when the salinity of the water source is

66

excessively high, advanced treatment processes such as NF and reverse osmosis (RO) can be

67

employed to improve the potability.21, 22 In summary, the modular characteristics of membrane

68

technology enable it to achieve highly efficient removal of viruses under complex water quality

69

conditions.22, 23

70
71

However, despite its effective role in virus removal from water environment, membrane

72

technology is currently primarily utilized in urban areas.24 Due to the limitations imposed by

73

factors such as regional economic development, population distribution and hydrological

74

conditions, the deployment of membrane separation strategies in centralized water treatment

75

in urban areas is challenging to extend to the decentralized water treatment processes in rural

76

areas.24, 25 Moreover, combined with the inadequate understanding of public hygiene among

77

local residents, this often results in viral outbreaks in rural areas lacking water treatment

78

facilities.26 For example, recent pandemic reports from the World Health Organization (WHO)

79

include poliovirus outbreaks in Tanzania, norovirus outbreaks in the Congo, and hepatitis E

80

virus outbreaks in South Sudan, etc.27 According to relevant research, approximately 1,800,000

81

deaths occur annually due to water quality safety and environmental sanitation, with over one-

82

third of these fatalities involving children under the age of five.28 Nearly all of these incidents

83

are reported in developing countries. Therefore, researchers have also begun to develop and

84

investigate membrane-based decentralized water treatment technologies, such as ceramic

85

membrane (MF) and gravity-driven membrane (UF).29, 30 These low-cost, low-maintenance,

86

and easy-to-operate membrane processes can effectively prevent the harm of pathogenic

87

viruses to human health.31-33

88
89

This critical review evaluates the contribution of membrane technology to the removal of

90

pathogenic viruses in water environments for public health protection, focusing on (1) the

91

transmission and hazards of viruses in the water environment, (2) the removal efficiency and

92

mechanisms of membrane technologies for viruses, and (3) the application and promotion of

93

membrane technologies under centralized and decentralized water treatment systems. Our

94

primary aim is to discuss the removal of viruses from the water environment through membrane

95

technology in both urban and rural areas, water supply and drainage processes, to ensure better

96

and comprehensive protection of public water security.

2. The current state of contamination by pathogenic viruses in the water

99

environment

100

2.1 Sources, transmission routes and hazards of pathogenic viruses

101

2.1.2 Sources and contamination levels

102

Typically, in natural rivers and lakes, the background level of pathogenic viruses in the water

103

environment is relatively low. For enteric viruses, it is approximately 102 to 104 copies L-1.34, 35

104

However, the water environment serves not only as the primary carrier for the survival of

105

pathogenic viruses but also as a harbor for the accumulation of various viruses.36 When virus-

106

containing pollutants enter the water environment, the number of viruses begins to increase

107

rapidly. For example, through the urban sewage networks, a multitude of pathogenic viruses,

108

such as norovirus, echoviruses, adenovirus, polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, and HIV, can

109

rapidly proliferate and damage the water environment, sourced from various origins, including

110

medical wastewater from hospitals, domestic sewage from communities, and leachate from

111

landfills.36-38 Although the numbers of these pathogenic viruses are significantly reduced after

112

passing through the wastewater or drinking water treatment plants (WTPs), taking several

113

WTPs in Table 1 as an example, they can still be detected in large quantities (exceeds the

114

WHO requirements, 10 viruses per liter).39 This suggests that such effluent water as an

115

important source of viral contamination, can pose a significant hidden risk for disease

116

transmission, it may mix with drinking water sources through surface runoff, and allowing

117

viruses to return to the community via the pipe network (as shown in Figure 1).

122
123

For rural areas, the issue of viral contamination of drinking water sources is even more

124

concerning.41, 42 Due to differences in lifestyle and customs, untreated sewage containing

125

pathogenic viruses, including human, livestock, and wildlife feces, as well as agricultural

126

irrigation, is commonly discharged in rural areas.24 This not only directly contaminates

127

drinking water sources but also indirectly exacerbates the transmission of vector-borne or

128

water-borne diseases, such as encephalitis, yellow fever, dengue fever, Lassa fever, Ebola

129

hemorrhagic fever, and Marburg virus disease.43 Moreover, in rural areas, there is often a lack

130

of effective water treatment facilities for water supply and drainage. Residents typically

131

directly consume water from surface water sources such as lakes, reservoirs, or groundwater

132

sources like wells, without undergoing reliable virus inactivation processes,24 and the number

133

of enteric viruses can even reach 107 copies L-1.44 This makes it easier for viruses to be

134

transmitted to humans via the fecal-oral route, leading to illness or even death.41

136

2.1.2 Transmission routes and hazards

137

Pathogenic viruses in water environments directly or indirectly pose serious and far-reaching

138

threats to human health. According to researchers, globally, there are approximately 1.2 to 2.4

139

million cases of diarrhea each year caused by viruses like norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus,

140

astrovirus, and enterovirus, resulting in 180,000 to 290,000 deaths.3 Meanwhile, diseases

141

caused by mosquito and fly bites, such as yellow fever virus and Zika virus, result in

142

approximately 84,000 to 170,000 severe cases and 29,000 to 60,000 deaths each year.26 In

143

addition to these acute diseases, the mortality resulting from chronic diseases caused by viruses,

144

such as the hepatitis virus, is also significantly alarming, with approximately 248 million

145

people worldwide infected with the HBV.45 All the cases mentioned above represent only a

146

fraction of the diseases caused by pathogenic viruses. As of 2001, the number of known

147

infectious viruses that can cause diseases in humans had already exceeded 217.6, 43

148
149

Unfortunately, when pathogenic viruses break out in urban areas, they can quickly spread

150

through the pipeline network to affect the majority of the population.1, 46 For example, an

151

outbreak of sapovirus and norovirus in Finland led to over 400 cases of gastroenteritis in

152

approximately a week, affecting about 4,000 people.46 In contrast, when viruses break out in

153

rural areas, the lack of effective treatment measures can result in even more serious casualties.41,

154

42

155

52,000 cases of jaundice and over 1,700 deaths, affecting around 600,000 people.41 In

For instance, an outbreak of hepatitis E virus in the Kashmir region of India resulted in

156

conclusion, whether viruses harm human health through water-borne or vector-borne routes,

157

direct consumption, or indirect contact, water supply and drainage processes are the primary

158

medium for their transmission (Figure 1). Therefore, significantly reducing viral

159

contamination in the water environment through WTPs can greatly enhance the health and

160

safety of residents.

2.2 Common technologies for pathogenic virus removal in the water environment

166

Regarding the issue of virus removal, under different water treatment modes, the main

167

strategies can be classified into two categories: (1) centralized treatment, such as drinking water

168

treatment plants (DWTPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and (2) decentralized

169

treatment, such as household water purifiers and biogas digester.

170

171
172

Figure 2. Schematic diagram and pathogenic virus removal efficiency at various stages of

173

conventional centralized WWTPs and DWTPs (draw according to Table 1 and Table S2&S3).

174
175

In urban centralized water treatment, the most widely used wastewater treatment strategy is the

176

activated sludge process, while the drinking water treatment strategy involves coagulation,

177

sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.70 Unfortunately, a large amount of data shows that
13

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3v3jg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-1238-130X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

178

the activated sludge process has a very limited effect on virus removal, with primary treatment

179

almost unable to remove viruses, and secondary treatment achieving a removal of only about

180

1~2 log.9, 61 Similarly, coagulation-precipitation removes about 0.4~1.7 log of viruses from

181

drinking water (Figure 2).8, 71 Therefore, for the effluent of DWTPs and WWTPs, disinfection

182

processes are always necessary, with chemical agents such as Cl2, ClO2 and NaClO being used

183

for oxidative inactivation of viruses.70

184
185

However, this process easily generates disinfection by-products like trihalomethanes (THMs),

186

haloacetic acid (HAA), and bromide precursors, causing secondary harm to the human.11 In

187

contrast, although the use of ultraviolet radiation is environmentally friendly, the

188

photoreactivation makes its viral inactivation effect unstable and susceptible to the influence

189

of turbidity.10 In decentralized household wastewater treatment, rural residents often collect

190

domestic wastewater in biogas digesters for fermentation or discharge it without treatment,

191

both of which have limited disinfection effects.59 For household drinking water treatment,

192

boiling is used for disinfection.72 Although boiling water can effectively inactivate viruses, it

193

directly accelerates the depletion of forests and grasslands, indirectly exacerbating greenhouse

194

effects and soil erosion.24 Therefore, the challenge of removing viruses through sustainable

195

technologies to protect human health remains persistent.

3. The mechanisms, applications, and influencing factors of pathogenic

198

virus removal by membrane technology

199

Membrane separation technology provides a new approach to virus removal in water treatment

200

processes (Figure 3). As a physical barrier based separation process that strictly adheres to the

201

size exclusion effect, membrane technology offers stable and consistent results in virus

202

removal.13 Additionally, compared to conventional technology (Table S3), membrane

203

filtration does not require the addition of any chemical agents, which not only saves costs but

204

also makes it environmentally friendly.15 Currently, with the development of membrane

205

technology, membrane filters have become more affordable, and their operational procedures

206

have simplified. Therefore, the application of membrane technology in virus removal processes

207

is gradually being promoted worldwide.

3.1 Microfiltration and Ultrafiltration

214

In general, the effluent water quality requirements for wastewater treatment and drinking water

215

treatment are different, which leads engineers to employ various membrane processes to

216

address virus contamination when designing water treatment plants. For centralized drinking

217

water treatment, considering the water quantity and stability in the water supply, membrane

218

units typically utilize UF membranes with pore sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm, which

219

appropriately cover the size range of most viruses.70 And combined with MF as pre-treatment

220

to control membrane fouling.

To directly understand the effectiveness of MF or UF as viral barriers in centralized DWTPs,

we compiled their removal performances for different viruses in the DWTPs and the laboratory

pilot. As shown in Figure 4, the removal efficiency of MS2 phage is significant, which were

229

2.0Â±1.3 log for MF and 3.8Â±1.1 log for UF, respectively.

230
231

The membrane unit, as the core of the filtration system, is considered to achieve separation

232

through strict size exclusion effects (Figure 5a). Therefore, it is generally assumed that

233

membranes cannot retain substances smaller than their pore size. Based on this, previous

234

studies have proposed estimation formulas for the theoretical retention rates of viruses by

235

membrane processes, i.e., Equation 1,73 and the logarithmic removal value determined by

236

experimental is calculated using Equation 2:

237

R = 1 â (1 â ð)2 â [2 â (1 â ð)2 ] â (ð¾ð  â2ð¾ð¡ )

(1)

238

LRV = âlog10 (ð¶effluent âð¶influent )

(2)

239

Where R is the theoretical retention rate (0 < R < 1) of the membrane for viruses within the

240

diameter range of the pore size; Î» is the ratio of virus diameter to membrane pore size (i.e.

241

dvirus/dpore); Ks and Kt are the hydrodynamic coefficients, specific calculations was described in

242

the reference;74, 75 LRV is the logarithmic retention value; Cinfluent and Ceffluent are the virus

243

concentration in the influent and effluent water, respectively.

244
245

However, numerous research cases indicate that the actual removal rate of viruses by

246

membrane processes is significantly higher than the theoretical retention rate based on size

247

exclusion effects. Specifically, for membranes with pore sizes of 50 nm and 100 nm, the

248

theoretical retention rates for MS2 phages are 0.44 log and 0.11 log, respectively (specific

249

calculations are shown in Supporting Information). However, during the laboratory membrane

250

separation process, the observed removal rates are as high as 3.54 log and 1.79 log,

251

respectively.76 This phenomenon suggests the possible existence of alternative mechanisms for

252

virus removal via membrane processes.

utilization situations (draw according to the content of references).48, 77, 78

257
258

The charge characteristics of both the virus and the membrane surface play a significant role

259

in enhancing the removal rate.16, 17 It is well known that the majority of viruses carry a negative

260

charge, such as the MS2 phages.79 And the properties of materials determine the charge of

261

membrane surface, for instance, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes exhibit a significant

262

negative charge.77 The attraction or repulsion forces between the charges on viruses and

263

membrane surfaces can significantly prevent viruses from entering the permeate, thereby

264

enhancing the virus removal capacity of the membrane (Figure 5b). Furthermore, the colloidal-

265

like properties exhibited by proteins enable effective adsorption of viruses within the

266

membrane pores, making an indispensable contribution to virus removal by the membrane.

267
268

3.2 Membrane Bioreactor

269

When membrane units are employed in WWTPs, the typical influent for MBR is the effluent

270

from sedimentation tanks or a mixture of activated sludge. In this situation, due to the presence

271

of a significant amount of colloids, particulates, organic matter, protozoa, and metazoa in the

272

influent, a relatively thick gelatinous cake layer tends to form on the membrane surface.80

273

Despite the cake layer may weaken the contribution of the charge effect, the overall virus

274

removal capacity of the MBR is not reduced. As shown in Figure 6, the removal capacity of

275

MBR is even superior to that of MF and UF with the same pore size.

276
277

Although MBR exhibits significant virus removal performance, it is highly dependent on the

278

formation of a cake layer. For instance, at a WWTP in Michigan, the membrane unit (hollow

279

fiber, PVDF, 450 nm) initially exhibited a removal efficiency of only 0.2 log for adenovirus

280

(~75 nm) during the early filtration stage. However, approximately one week later, this

281

efficiency increased to around 6.3 log.81 During this process, the dynamic cake layer formed

282

by colloids, particulates and microorganisms in the wastewater provides two distinct pathways

283

for the removal of viruses, i.e., (1) adsorption and retention by the cake layer, and (2) predation

284

and degradation by microorganisms (Figure 5c&5d).

287

Figure 6. The virus removal efficiency of membrane units with different pore sizes in pilot and

288

full-scale MBR processes (specific data is extracted from Table 1 and Table S2).

289
290

This indicates that the contribution of the cake layer (including colloids and microbes) in the

291

MBR system to virus removal is crucial. Especially when the size of the virus is smaller than

292

the membrane pore, the contribution of the cake layer becomes even more significant.

293

Specifically, in a study conducted by Rabia Chaudhry, the removal rate of ÏX174 phage

294

increased gradually in three MBR experiments: a clean membrane, a membrane with a cake

295

layer, and a membrane system containing sludge, measuring 0.4 log, 1.1 log, and 2.3 log,

296

respectively.80 Therefore, parameters related to the cake layer and sludge in wastewater

297

treatment systems can influence the efficiency of virus removal, such as sludge retention time

298

(SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids

299

(MLSS), aeration intensity, and influent carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.14, 18 Meanwhile, the

300

contribution of the membrane unit cannot be ignored either. As shown in Figure 6, as the pore

301

size of the membrane unit decreases, the average virus removal efficiency of the MBR system

302

significantly increases. The membrane unit provides the MBR system with a strong size

303

exclusion effect, including (1) retention of viruses and (2) retention of sludge. This ensures that

304

the MBR system can achieve a stable and efficient removal state more quickly, thereby keeping

305

the virus concentration in the effluent within a safe range.

306
307

3.3 Nanofiltration and Reverse Osmosis

308

As environmental hygiene deteriorates, the requirements for addressing viral risks in drinking

309

water have become more stringent. Taking rotavirus as an example, the WHO recommends in

310

its drinking water quality guidelines that the number of viruses per liter of drinking water must

311

not exceed 10.39 Therefore, even though the virus content in the permeate from MF and UF is

312

already very low, further treatment with NF and RO is not redundant. For these two membrane

313

processes, where the MWCO is much smaller than molecular of virus particles, their virus

314

removal efficiencies range from 2.8~6.1 log for NF and 3.0~7.9 log for RO, respectively

315

(Figure 7).

318

Figure 7. The virus removal efficiency by MF, UF, NF, and RO (colored numbers represent

319

the averages, and specific data is extracted from Table S2).

320
321

Certainly, as we have observed, membrane processes always exhibit a range of fluctuating

322

values for virus removal, even though NF and RO can theoretically retain viruses completely.

323

Researchers believe that the primary reason for viruses passing through NF and RO membranes

324

is defects in the membrane structure caused by unexpected issues during preparation and

325

utilization.13 The most crucial aspects among these are the pore size, the distribution of

326

membrane pores, and its integrity, as the size exclusion effect represents the fundamental

327

characteristic of membrane separation processes.

328
329

In practical engineering, defects in the installation of membrane units can directly affect the

330

integrity of the filtration system, such as compromised O-rings and broken mechanical seals.13

331

The worse the integrity of membrane system, the higher the probability of viruses passing

332

through it. And operation conditions can also significantly influence the efficacy of virus

333

removal, including crossflow velocity, transmembrane pressure, and cleaning strategies. In a

334

membrane system, crossflow velocity can mitigate the negative impact of concentration

335

polarization, thereby reducing the probability of viruses passing through the membrane pores.82,

336

83

337

the membrane surface and may potentially lead to membrane stretching, which can damage its

338

structure. Gemunu Herath conducted ceramic membrane filtration experiments to quantify the

339

impact of crossflow velocity and transmembrane pressure on virus removal rates.84 Under

340

constant pressure (40 kPa), as the velocity increased from 0.85 m s-1 to 2.45 m s-1, the removal

341

rate of QÎ² phage increased from 25% to 75%. In contrast, under constant velocity (1 m s-1), as

342

the pressure increased from 40 kPa to 120 kPa, the removal rate decreased from 30% to 5%.84

343

Inappropriate cleaning strategies can result in membrane aging, such as those involving acid,

344

alkali, and chlorine cleaning.85 During the cleaning process, the hydrophobicity and surface

345

charge of the membrane may be altered. Oxidative cleaning can disrupt the composite layer on

346

the membrane surface, leading to a loss of filtration effectiveness and deterioration of the

347

permeate water quality.86, 87 Furthermore, repeated pressurization can also lead to a decline in

348

the performance of membrane separation. For instance, a study indicated that after undergoing

349

ten thousand pressurization cycles, the removal efficiency of ÏX174 phage by RO membranes

350

decreased from approximately 4.0 log to 1.8 log.83

Conversely, increased transmembrane pressure accelerates the accumulation of viruses on

4. Membrane technology for decentralized water treatment systems

352

Although MBR systems can be applied to both centralized and decentralized WWTPs, it is

353

regrettable that effective technologies such as MF, UF, NF, and RO used in urban centralized

354

DWTPs are challenging to apply in rural decentralized DWTPs. The primary issues are

355

economic costs. Due to the long distances between rural settlements, the cost of installing water

356

supply pipelines is extremely high. And the complex geological environments in rural areas

357

intensify the difficulties in constructing pre-treatment facilities.24, 25 Additionally, the operation

358

and maintenance of membrane processes also pose challenges for residents. All these factors

359

limit the promotion of centralized drinking water treatment processes in rural areas. In other

360

words, decentralized DWTPs require a low-cost, easy-to-operate process with effective virus

361

removal. In the past decade, with continuous improvements in MF and UF technologies by

362

researchers and engineers, low-cost, low-maintenance membrane processes have gradually

363

entered the household water purification phase. And typical point-of-use processes include

364

ceramic membrane (MF) and gravity-driven membrane (UF).

365
366

Generally, commercial ceramic membranes are manufactured using alumina, and the primary

367

configurations currently include tubular filters (Figure 8a) and pot filters (Figure S1). While

368

the cost of ceramic materials may be slightly higher than that of polymer materials, the thermal

369

stability, chemical stability, high mechanical strength, and low membrane fouling

370

characteristics of ceramic membranes contribute to a longer life cycle, reducing the need for

371

frequent replacements.78 The advantage of low-maintenance makes ceramic membranes highly

372

suitable for decentralized drinking water treatment. In theory, ceramic membranes, as a form

373

of MF-level process, have limited virus retention capabilities. However, based on numerous

374

practical cases, ceramic membranes have demonstrated significant effectiveness in virus

375

removal. During the production process, raw materials often incorporate dopants such as silver

376

nitrate, iron oxide, and copper nitrate.88 These dopants provide additional virus inactivation

377

pathways, thereby enhancing the performance of ceramic membranes in virus removal. For

378

example, a pot ceramic membrane filter widely used in Cambodia can achieve a removal rate

379

of 3.5 to 4.8 log for MS2 phage in the first 100 liters of water during challenge testing, with an

380

average subsequent removal rate of approximately 1.2 log.47 Moreover, in laboratory-scale

381

tests, tubular ceramic membranes achieved a removal rate of 6.7 log or even higher for MS2

382

phage.29 It is praiseworthy that these ceramic filters, priced at less than $10, provide a robust

383

barrier for the health of local residents.47

389
390

Similar to ceramic membrane microfiltration, the gravity-driven membrane (GDM) developed

391

by the Eawag team also offers the advantages of low-cost and low-maintenance.33 In principle,

392

even pot ceramic filters are membrane separation systems driven by gravity. The GDM process

393

using UF membranes as the filtration unit was first reported in 2010.89 It can also be described

394

as a biofilm-controlled UF process, because the decomposition of organic fouling by

395

microorganisms in the cake layer maintains a dynamic balance between the resistance from the

396

influent and the total resistance of the membrane system.33 Due to the dead-end filtration

397

approach in GDM process, its permeate flux is slightly lower than that of other membrane

398

processes, usually around 3 to 8 L m-2 h-1.90 For a GDM process with a stable permeate flux of

399

5 L m-2 h-1, only 0.5 mÂ²of filtration area is needed to produce 60 L of suitable drinking water

400

daily (Figure S2). This system is well-suited to meet the daily water needs of households with

401

lower water demand. Most importantly, regardless of the influent water quality, the GDM

402

process can always achieve a threshold of permeate flux and maintain stability over the long

403

term without the need for cleaning. The low investment cost, low maintenance requirements,

404

and low energy consumption of the GDM process perfectly address the challenges of

405

decentralized drinking water supply. As a novel technology, although there are not many

406

reported cases regarding the virus removal effectiveness of the GDM process, there is no doubt

407

that the dual retention effects of UF membranes combined with the cake layer can provide a

408

relatively effective virus removal performance. For example, in a study by Peter-Varbanets,

409

the GDM process equipped with flat-sheet UF membranes achieved an approximately 4 log
26

410

removal rate of MS2 phage after the formation of the cake layer.90 And another GDM process

411

using hollow fiber UF membranes also demonstrated a stable 4 log removal efficiency.30 In

412

other words, the GDM process is reliable in addressing pathogenic virus risks.

413
414

Up to now, these two simple and effective membrane processes have been applied in several

415

countries, including Kenya, Nepal, and Uganda, among others.31, 32, 90 Both ceramic membrane

416

and gravity-driven membrane are recommended by the WHO for point-of-use drinking water

417

treatment, especially when the quality of the water source is poor.

418

419

5. Advanced membrane technologies for pathogenic virus removal

420

In contrast to MF, UF, NF, and RO, which primarily rely on smaller pore sizes or lower

421

MWCOs to intercept and retain viruses as physical barriers, several new membrane

422

technologies have shown excellent potential for virus removal. These can be categorized into

423

(1) membrane distillation, which inactivates viruses through high temperatures; (2) membrane-

424

based photocatalytic, which inactivates viruses through oxidation reaction of free radicals, and

425

(3) membrane-based electrosorption, which capture viruses through Coulombic force. All of

426

these provide a more direct pathway for virus removal based on the size exclusion effect of the

427

membrane unit.

428
429

For membrane distillation (MD), it is a membrane process driven by the vapor pressure gradient.

430

In the operation of the MD system, water from the high-temperature impure feed stream passes
27

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3v3jg ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-1238-130X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

431

through the membrane pores in the form of water vapor, liquefies in the lower-temperature

432

distillate stream, and flows out to achieve the separation of water and solutes (Figure 9a). This

433

dictates that MD systems require the use of hydrophobic membrane units.91 Hydrophobic

434

membranes have a stronger virus retention capacity compared to hydrophilic ones used in

435

conventional membrane filtration processes, allowing MD system to retain viruses on the feed

436

stream side. Moreover, the high-temperature conditions during MD system operation lead to

437

irreversible structural damage to viruses, providing dual assurance for virus removal through a

438

combination of membrane retention and thermal inactivation. According to the research by

439

Mukta Hardikar, the MD system equipped with a nominal pore size of 450 nm PTFE membrane

440

demonstrates an increased removal rate of MS2 phages with the rise of feed stream temperature.

441

At 45Â°C, 55Â°C, and 65Â°C, the removal rates can reach 2 log, 4 log, and 6 log, respectively. 91

442

This implies that at typical MD operating temperatures (greater than 65 Â°C), the virus removal

443

rate is appreciable, even when the size of membrane pores is much larger than that of the virus.

444

In addition, compared to boiling, the energy consumption of MD system is slightly lower, as it

445

can utilize low-grade waste heat to address viral risks in water environments.

Figure 10. The schematic diagrams of advanced membrane technologies; (a) membrane

449

distillation, (b) membrane-based photocatalytic, (c) membrane-based electrosorption.

450
451

Among various novel material composite membranes, photocatalytic membranes are one of

452

the outstanding designs. In the context of frequent virus outbreaks, photocatalytic materials

453

serve as an effective alternative to traditional chlorine disinfection, as they do not produce

454

disinfection by-products and can be reused.92 Photocatalytic membranes possess the

455

advantages of being environmentally friendly, efficient, and sustainable. Currently, titanium

456

dioxide (TiO2) is the most extensively studied photocatalytic material. The composite

457

membranes can be easily produced by loading TiO2 nanoparticles onto the surface of

458

commercial membranes to form a coated film (Figure 9b). Researchers believe that virus

459

removal mechanisms of TiO2 composite membranes include (1) size exclusion of membrane

460

pores, (2) adsorption of TiO2 nanoparticles, and (3) oxidation reactions of free radicals.92, 93 It

461

is note that TiO2 undergoes a photocatalytic reaction under sunlight irradiation, generating

462

reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals (OHâ) and superoxide radicals (O2Â·).

463

These ROS can induce protein denaturation, capsid degradation, genome damage in viruses,

464

leading to their complete inactivation.93 Specifically, in a study conducted by Inna Horovitz,

465

under simulated sunlight irradiation, a nominal 800 nm pore size flat Al2O3 membrane with

466

TiO2 coating could achieved a removal rate of approximately 4.9 log for MS2 phages.94

467

468

Membrane-based electrosorption also provides an alternative strategy for the removal of

469

viruses in water environments. Although typical membrane electrode technologies, such as

470

capacitive deionization (CDI), are commonly used for the removal of ionic contaminants, they

471

also exhibit good capture capabilities for charged viruses.95 As shown in Figure 9c, under the

472

action of Coulombic force, the viruses are firmly adsorbed onto the electrode until saturation

473

is reached. Compared to dead-end filtration, in the charging-discharging cycle of the membrane

474

electrode, viruses are desorbed during the discharging phase and enter the concentrated stream,

475

thereby completely leaving the membrane filtration system. The periodic desorption process

476

prevents the accumulation of viruses on the membrane surface, reducing the possibility of

477

viruses entering the permeate. Most importantly, electrosorption exhibits a strong ability to

478

remove viruses. For instance, research conducted by Rebecca Gordon indicates that under low

479

concentrations of PBS solution conditions, CDI achieves a removal rate of approximately 4.5

480

log for MS2 phages.95

481
482

In addition, there are numerous other membrane separation processes for virus removal, which

483

can be roughly categorized as (1) improved processes based on MF, UF, NF, and RO; and (2)

484

improved processes based on the advanced membrane technologies. For the former, it primarily

485

involves enhancing virus adsorption and retention on membranes by loading materials with a

486

high specific surface area on the membrane, such as activated carbon, graphene, carbon

487

nanotubes, etc. For the latter, the focus is on addressing the challenges that these advanced

488

membrane technologies face during operation. For example, wetting, scaling, and fouling can
30

489

affect the performance of membrane distillation; turbidity and the wavelength of light can

490

influence photocatalytic reactions; and the pH and ionic strength of the influent can impact the

491

electrosorption process. In summary, although these advanced membrane processes still face a

492

series of challenges in practical applications, their excellent virus removal capabilities provide

493

more strategies for mitigating virus risks in water environments.

494

495

6. Conclusion and outlook

496

When addressing the hazards of pathogenic viruses in water environments, membrane

497

separation technology stands out as a direct, efficient, and reliable treatment method for virus

498

removal. It allows for flexible selection of MF, UF, NF, and RO modules as virus removal

499

units, catering to the specific needs of centralized or decentralized, drinking water or

500

wastewater treatment. Whether employed in centralized drinking water treatment through

501

direct membrane filtration combined with pre-treatment, utilized in decentralized drinking

502

water treatment through ceramic microfiltration or gravity-driven ultrafiltration, or applied in

503

wastewater treatment through membrane bioreactor, these processes consistently achieve

504

efficient virus removal. The mechanisms include size exclusion, charge effects, adsorption and

retention by the cake layer, as well as predation and decomposition by microorganisms. All

506

these works together to intercept viruses on the influent side.

507
508

Despite being one of the most effective virus removal strategies, these membrane processes

509

still have limitations. Various factors can influence the actual virus retention efficiency of

membrane processes, including the membrane integrity, pore size and distribution of the

511

membrane, the pH and ionic strength of the influent, and the transmembrane pressure and

512

stream flow rate during process operation. Furthermore, pressure-driven membrane processes

513

can retain viruses but cannot completely inactivate them. This could result in the intrusion of

514

viruses into bacteria or other microorganisms, releasing small molecular toxic substances and

515

more viruses. Additionally, whether in MF and UF or NF and RO, the entry of viruses into the

516

permeate through membrane units is inevitable. While these membranes can effectively retain

517

viruses, they are not absolute barriers, even when the size of the viruses is significantly larger

518

than the membrane pores. It is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the process of virus

519

transport through membrane pores and to clearly delineate improvement strategies for

520

membrane processes.

521
522

Certainly, in the face of the threat posed by pathogenic viruses, there is much work to be done.

523

Firstly, in developing countries where the impact of virus outbreaks is most severe, the design,

524

application, and promotion of membrane processes are crucial. They require simpler, cheaper,

525

and more effective membrane technologies to ensure the safety of drinking water. Since

526

membrane processes typically only retain viruses and lack the capability to inactivate them, a

527

significant number of live viruses may still persist in sludge and backwashing effluents. This

528

could pose potential threats to the water environment, emphasizing the importance of

529

comprehensive and harmless treatment throughout the entire process. Moreover, it is essential

530

to prioritize the detection and monitoring of virus content in the influent and effluent of

531

membrane processes. A robust early warning system can provide engineers with the enough

532

time to maintain membrane process, residents to take emergency measures, and governments

533

to make informed decisions. Ultimately, this ensures public health safety in water environments.
