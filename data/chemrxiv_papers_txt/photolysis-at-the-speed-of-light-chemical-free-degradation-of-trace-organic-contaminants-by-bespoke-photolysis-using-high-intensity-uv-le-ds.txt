UV LEDs have demonstrated effectiveness in disinfection applications and proven suitability at
scale for disinfection in municipal wastewater and drinking water. Technological advances in
materials design and electrical efficiency have made high-intensity light delivery by UV C LEDs
a reality and now poise these traditionally disinfection system to serve a dual purpose for targeted
remediation of trace contaminants. This work investigated the effectiveness of UV C light
emission tailoring on the photodegradation dynamics of select trace organic compounds (TrOCs).
Degradation kinetics and quantum yields of target compounds under 275 nm irradiation were
governed by molar absorbance and chemical structure, and kinetics followed estrone (E1) >
tryptophan > caffeine ≈ pCBA > urea. Secondary experiments compared the efficacy of a 275 nm
UV LED and medium-pressure mercury vapour (MP UV) system for photodegradation of two
steroid estrogens, E1 & 17b-estradiol (17b-E2). Use of the 275 nm UV LED system substantially
reduced fluence requirements to achieve 90% degradation of both compounds. LC-MS/MS
analysis of E1 photodegradation products showed that the UV LED system was more effective in
eliminating both the E1 and its associated photoproduct compared to the MP UV system. This
work demonstrates the effective use of UV LEDs for tailored photolysis of TrOCs and provides
evidence for their use potential in applications outside of water disinfection.

INTRODUCTION

27

The widespread use of UV light in water treatment has long been recognized as a safe and effective

28

method to inactivate pathogenic organisms and ensure water safety. UV water treatment systems

29

were first produced commercially in the 1930’s and are now commonplace in municipal and

30

industrial applications. Commercial UV treatment systems currently rely on the use of mercury-

31

based UV light-emitting lamps which have historically been the only industry-ready UV treatment

32

devices commercially available. The use of mercury in commercial and consumer products is

33

being sequentially phased out in the European Union via Regulation - 2024/18491. The United

34

Nations Minamata Convention, currently supported by 128 signatories, is set to ban mercury

35

mining by 20322. Mercury has long been known for its neurotoxicity effects3, and the realities of

36

mercury mining can result in long-lasting environmental and human-health effects to both miners

37

and those living in affected regions4,5. It is therefore not only necessary to evaluate and validate

38

technological water treatment alternatives to comply with current and future regulations, but also

39

to ensure safe development and sourcing of materials used in consumer and industrial products.

40

The emergence of solid-state light emitters (SSLEs), such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs),

41

revolutionized consumer technology industries in the mid-20th century6,7. Today, SSLE devices

42

can be found in almost all consumer and industrial devices requiring illumination. The versatility,

43

adaptability, and efficiency of SSLEs has opened the door to illumination technologies that would

44

not be possible with historical lighting alternatives. While visible and infrared light LEDs have

45

been commercially available since the 1970s, UV-emitting solid-state light sources, or UV LEDs,

46

have only become available to consumer and industrial markets in the last two decades6 and are

47

now poised to disrupt the water treatment industry analogously to SSLEs in technological

48

applications.

49

UV LEDs have many inherent properties that provide benefits over commercially available

50

mercury-vapour systems6,8,9. UV LED devices are made of semiconductor chips which can be

51

densely packed into UV reactors to provide effective and uniform treatment. Their design

52

versatility and ability to run on battery power also makes them an adaptable measure for point-of-

53

use applications such as at-the-tap water disinfection for isolated areas (e.g., campgrounds,

54

portable water disinfection devices). The dimmable nature of UV LEDs allows ramping up or

55

down of UV intensity in cases where water quality is affected by seasonal dynamics, whereas

56

mercury lamps are designed to operate at a stable, consistent brightness as frequent lamp cycling

57

truncates the lifecycle of conventional systems. UV LEDs have proven effective for disinfection

58

in small-scale10 and decentralized drinking water systems11, biofilm-based Pseudomonas

59

aeruginosa12, and most recently for a full-scale 2-MLD wastewater treatment system13.

60

UV LEDs wavelength emission can be tailored dependant on treatment application. Unlike

61

commercially available mercury-vapour lamps which emit monochromatically at 253.7 or 365 nm,

62

or polychromatically between 200 – 600 nm, UV LEDs emit light within narrow wavelength bands

63

(i.e., full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) ~ 10-15 nm) which are dependent on the band gap

64

energy of the employed semiconductor materials8. Most current generation UV LEDs are

65

composed of AlxGa1-xN semiconductor materials, which are non-toxic, UV transparent and

66

materially conductive6. The composition of the AlxGa1-xN material can be theoretically adjusted

67

to achieve wavelength emission regions ranging from 210 – 365 nm14. The versatility in emittance

68

wavelength of AlxGa1-xN-based UV LEDs makes them adaptable to treatment applications

69

requiring light in wide ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., UV A – UV C)6. The potential

70

for bespoke UV LED treatment through specific wavelengths has demonstrated flexibility to target

71

specific biomarkers and thereby lower required UV fluence to achieve pathogen inactivation

72

objectives15–18.

73

Photolytic degradation of chemical contaminants can be optimized by tailoring UV LED

74

wavelength emission to the absorbance spectrum of a compound of interest. Photons emitted

75

within the typical UV treatment region of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., 300 nm – 200 nm)

76

have energies ranging from 4.13 – 6.2 eV or 95.2 – 143 kcal mol-1 which is sufficient to break

77

most chemical bonds (e.g., C-H bonds in alkanes have bond dissociation energies (BDEs) ranging

78

from 94 – 99 kcal mol-1 while BDEs in C-C bonds range from 77 – 83 kcal mol-1 in aliphatic

79

compounds19). Wavelength-specific photolysis of chemical contaminants has been limitedly

80

investigated9,19–23, but technological advancements and significant improvements in power output

81

have made delivery of high-intensity UV light from LED sources a reality8. This advancement

82

along with wavelength tuneability and development of high-density reactors poise UV LEDs to be

83

a disruptive technology for which beyond disinfection is possible.

84

Here, we evaluate the efficacy of UV C LEDs to degrade trace organic compounds (TrOCs)

85

through photolysis-initiated reactions and introduce a novel, high-intensity flow-through UV C

86

LED reactor which provides high fluence delivery (i.e., > 1000 mJ cm-2) in a matter of seconds.

87

We also evaluate the impact of compound-specific parameters to infer both practical and

88

theoretical potential for UV C LED photolytic degradation and compare UV C LED treatment

89

effectiveness and electrical efficiency to traditional MP UV systems under collimated beam setups.

90

Finally, we discuss future potential and application for UV C LEDs as a chemical-free water

91

treatment tool and replacement for mercury-vapour lamps. TrOCs are notoriously difficult to

92

remove and abate using traditional water treatment technologies and can cause unintended issues

93

when interacting with conventional chemical disinfectants. Wavelength dependant interactions

94

between TrOCs and light are not well understood across the UV C spectrum but there are

95

indications that photolysis alone could help mitigate unintended byproduct formation24. The use

96

of tailored UV reactors will lead to a future that does not require the use of chlorine, ozone, or

97

peroxide for the removal of emergent contaminants while also removing mercury from the

98

treatment process.

105

E1 & 17b-E2 which were spiked directly from their purchased 1 g L-1 stock in methanol and

106

acetonitrile (respectively). LCMS-grade methanol, LCMS-grade formic acid, and Optima

107

acetonitrile used in LC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV/Vis analysis were purchased from Fisher Scientific.

112

Initial photolysis experiments (Part 1) using the 275 nm UVC LED flow-through reactor were

113

conducted using a range of organic compounds including: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA),

114

commonly used as a probe compound for estimation of OH• radical exposure in AOP systems37,72;

115

urea, a major waste product in municipal wastewater, industrial, and agricultural effluent streams73;

116

tryptophan, an amino acid indicative of microbial activity in biological systems74,75; caffeine, an

117

alkaloid and a probe compound for OH• and reactive chlorine species (RCS)76 and a tracer for

118

anthropogenic contamination; and two steroid estrogens, E1 & 17b-E2. These compounds were

119

chosen to the differing structure, molar absorbance in the 275 nm emittance range and sensitivity

120

121

Secondary experiments (Part 2) were conducted using two steroid hormones (E1 and 17b-E2) as

122

target compounds to evaluate and compare their response to 275 nm UV C LED and MP UV

123

irradiation in collimated beam setups. These compounds were chosen for secondary experiments

124

as they are well known TrOCs that are of environmental concern55 and exhibit differing sensitivity

125

to UVC irradiation29,32,35. The chemical structure, CAS number, and molar mass of each of the

126

described compound is given in Figure SI-1 while their absorbance spectra can be found in Figure

Reactor Characteristics and Design

129

2.3.1

Flow-Through UVC LED Reactor

130

Initial experiments were conducted using a bench-scale DC UV C LED reactor, the PearlAqua

131

ThinFilm 534A2 (AquiSense Technologies ©), which consists of four main components: a light

132

source assembly, a safety shield, a flow cell, and a driver assembly. The reactor contains an array

133

of 192 UV C LED chips which emit light at a 275 nm peak emission wavelength (See Figure 2 for

134

emission spectrum). The reactor was equipped with a 4 cm x 15 cm x 2.5 cm quartz laminar flow

135

cell with a volume of 4.13 cm3. A schematic of the reactor is given in Figure SI-2. The emittance

136

spectrum of the reactor can be seen in Figure 2 while the laminar flow cell is shown in Figure SI-

137

3.

138

The driver assembly houses the power supply, which converts AC electrical input to DC electrical

139

output for the lamp assembly and transmits data via MODBUS. An intermediate coolant loop is

140

used to cool the driver assembly and routes coolant (tap water) from the cooling block through the

141

lamp assembly. A laptop is connected to the driver assembly and controls the lamp output via the

142

user interface. The interface enables control of the light source assembly, the power level and

143

senses the temperature of the internal electrical components. Coolant water was supplied via by

144

connecting the cooling block to a barbed faucet tap using rubber hosing. The influent sample water

145

was controlled using a peristaltic pump which was calibrated to range of flow rates (Table SI-1).

146

2.3.2

147

Secondary experiments were carried out using an Aquisense PearlBeam unit (UV LED

148

experiments) with an average irradiance of 3.62 mW cm-2 (3.5 cm from the edge of the collimator)

149

and 275 nm peak emittance, and a Calgon Carbon collimated beam unit equipped with a 1000 kW

155

Through Reactor

156

The starting concentration of the selected target compounds varied due to range of analytical

157

methods required for quantitation and solubility limitations (Table SI-3). The aqueous solution of

158

target compound was connected via rubber tubing to a water pump and the reactor. The starting

159

sample volume was 2 L which was spiked with a concentrated working solution of target analytes

160

to achieve target concentrations. The samples were collected from the outlet of the reactor and

161

circulated multiple times (Table SI-1) to achieve a range of UV fluences (as determined by uridine

162

actinometry; see Methods below). Samples were taken during each recirculation round.

163

Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Between each sample run, an ultrapure water rinse of

164

more than 90 seconds (approximately 150 mL) was completed at a flow rate of 100 ml min-1.

165

Sample volume collected for analysis was 10 mL. Samples undergoing LC-MS/MS quantitation

166

(E1, 17b-E2, caffeine, & tryptophan) were fortified with their associated internal standards prior

167

to analysis. All data at or above calculated method detection limits (MDLs) are reported as their

168

quantitated value. Only data at or above calculated limits of quantitation (LOQs) were used in

169

kinetics calculations. MDLs and LOQs of target compounds are given in Table SI-3.

170

2.4.2

171

Collimated beam experiments were carried out using 50 mL water samples spiked with 10 μg L-1

172

of E1 or 17b-E2 from a 100 mg L-1 solution in methanol. Samples were exposed to fluences of 25

173

– 10 000 mJ cm-2 from either UV C LED (275 nm) or medium-pressure UV light sources. Samples

174

were adjusted to pH 7 using a combination of potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4) and

175

potassium phosphate dibasic (K2HPO4) at 2 mM concentrations.

176

Samples were stirred constantly during treatment and equilibrated for a period of 1 min before

177

starting experiments. 240 µL aliquots were removed from the 50 mL sample throughout the

178

experiment at time points corresponding to chosen UV doses. The smallest possible aliquot volume

179

was used as to not significantly affect the pathlength of the water sample and subsequently the UV

180

fluence received by the water matrix (< 5% change in sample volume). 240 µL aliquots were

181

placed in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes, fortified with 40 µg L-1 13C6-17b-E2 internal standard, and

182

transferred to 2-mL amber autosampler vials before being analyzed via LC-MS/MS. All data at or

183

above calculated method detection limits (MDLs) are reported. Only data at or above the calculated

216

The irradiance of the 275 nm flow-through reactor was calculated using the methods outlined by

217

Pousty et al. (2023)79 and the following assumptions. The petri factor (PF) was assumed to be 1

218

since the irradiance of different parts of the cell should not differ within the ThinFilm Reactor. The

219

molar absorption coefficients of uridine used in calculations were 10 185 M-1 cm-1 at 262 nm80 and

220

8000 M-1 cm-1 at 275nm81. The calculated irradiance via uridine actinometry was 249 mW cm-2.

The efficacy of 275 nm light in degrading each of the compounds is governed by both the spectral

273

absorbance and the chemical structure of each compound. The photon energy absorbed by a given

274

compound must be sufficient to overcome a given chemical bond energy for photodissociation to

275

occur. All compounds, with the exception of urea, exhibited moderate to high molar absorbance

276

in the emittance range of the UV LED reactor (Figure 2). The compounds that exhibited minimal

277

degradation under 275 nm irradiation (i.e., pCBA & caffeine) followed a similar degradation

278

profile in resisting photodissociation from 275nm light (Figure 1 i)) which is further described in

279

later discussion.

3.1.1.1

Degradation of Compounds Sensitive to 275 nm UV Light

284

Tryptophan was degraded at the second highest rate of all target compounds evaluated and

285

exhibited > 95% degradation (below detectible limits) at the highest fluence condition (kobs = 1.62

286

x 10-3 cm2 mJ-1; Table 1). Tryptophan exhibits high absorbance in the 275 nm wavelength range

287

(ε23456 = 6543 M-1 cm-1) which is attributed to its highly conjugated indole ring and carbonyl

288

group on C1 (Figure SI-1). Previous work has similarly observed that tryptophan will readily

289

degrade under UV irradiation and can both undergo direct photolysis and participate in auto-

290

oxidation reactions to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can further contribute to

291

degradation25,26.

299

photolysis under LP UV, MP UV and even solar irradiation27,31–35 and has an absorbance band

300

around 280 nm with peak l = 281 (Figure 2), e275nm – 281nm = 2027 – 2568 M-1 cm-1. The presence

301

of the phenolic ring on E1 is responsible for the observed 280 nm absorbance band while the C17

302

carbonyl group provides weak absorption ~290 nm27–29 both of which overlap with the emittance

303

of the 275 nm UV C LED reactor used in this study.

304

During E1 photolysis, we observed the evolution and disappearance of a photoproduct throughout

305

treatment which had the same quantifier and qualifier ion transitions as E1 (m/z 269.1 -> 145 and

306

269.1 -> 143.2, respectively) with a slightly later retention time (6.62 min for E1 vs. 7.16 min for

307

the photoproduct) as shown in Figure SI-4, SI-5 A. The ion transitions and nominal mass of the

308

photoproduct are consistent with the 13a-epimer of E1, lumiestrone, which is structurally identical

309

to E1 with the exception of a the rotation of the C13 methyl group and has been reported in the

310

literature to be the primary photoproduct of E127,34,36. The primary mode of E1 degradation at ~280

311

nm emittance is dependent on photon absorption by the phenol group and transfer of excitation to

312

the carbonyl group, leading to epimerization and subsequent formation of lumiestrone, a reaction

313

which is both solvent- and wavelength-dependant27. This energy transfer mechanism is most likely

314

due to direct emission from the phenol group after excitation (~304 nm) which overlaps with the

315

absorption of the carbonyl group (~290 nm)30. Interestingly, rapid photodegradation of E1 as

316

compared to other steroid estrogens is well documented in the literature27,34,35 and is most likely

317

due to the aforementioned energy transfer mechanism as E1 is the only steroid estrogen containing

318

a carbonyl group. We observed rapid evolution of the photoproduct with peak formation occurring

319

at a fluence of 231 mJ cm-2 (Figure SI-4, SI-5 A). Photoproduct response then decreased with

320

increasing fluence to a maximum 2464 mJ cm-2, where the photoproduct was reduced by > 98%

321

of maximum peak response observed at the 231 mJ cm-2 condition.

3.1.1.2

Degradation of Compounds Resistant to 275 nm UV Light

323

Urea was negligibly degraded under 275 nm irradiation and exhibited a maximum of mean < 1%

324

removal even under the highest fluence condition (3081 mJ cm-2; kobs = 7.92 x 10-6 cm2 mJ-1; Figure

325

1; Table 1). Urea exhibits very low or no absorbance within the emittance range of the 275 nm

326

LED (0–1.2 M-1 cm-1 between 258 – 315; Figure 2). Photons must be absorbed by a compound to

327

undergo photochemical reactions (Grauss-Draper law). Degradation data for urea were a poor fit

328

for first-order kinetics (r2 = 0.641; Table 1) which is unsurprising due to low removal exhibited

329

throughout experiments.

330

pCBA was minimally degraded during treatment and exhibited a maximum of mean 19 % removal

331

under highest fluence conditions (kobs = 7.23 x 10-5 cm2 mJ-1; Figure 1; Table 1). pCBA exhibits

332

moderate absorbance within the UV C LED emittance range (Figure 2) with e275nm = 600 and thus

333

would be capable photon absorption under this scenario. It is well known that pCBA does not

334

readily undergo photolysis under both low-pressure (LP UV) and MP UV irradiation37 and its

335

photostability has made it widely used as a OH• probe in advanced oxidative processes (AOP)

336

studies37–39. The low reaction rate constant observed for pCBA could indicate that 275 nm light

337

irradiation does not readily induce formation of reactive oxygen species such as OH• and its

338

degradation solely driven by photolysis. pCBA contains a conjugated benzene ring, carbonyl group

339

on C1 and lone pair electrons on the Cl atom which contributes to its UV absorbance (Figure SI-

340

1). The electronegativity of the Cl atom on C4 creates an electron withdrawing effect on the

341

benzene ring. This can reduce photodegradation efficiency as has been described for other

342

chlorophenols undergoing UV irradiation40 which explains its minimal photodegradation observed

343

here and by others37.

344

Caffeine was similarly degraded to pCBA exhibiting a maximum of 17 % (kobs = 6.61 x 10-5 cm-2

345

mJ-1) mean removal at the highest fluence condition and 95% confidence intervals indicate no

346

statistically significant difference in degradation kinetics between pCBA and caffeine (Table 1).

347

Though caffeine exhibits very high molar absorbance within the relevant emittance range (e275nm

348

= 9884 M-1 cm-1), minimal degradation of caffeine under UV irradiation has been similarly

349

observed in previous work41–45. Caffeine absorbs readily within the UV treatment (i.e. 200-300

350

nm) range due to its extensive electron delocalization across the purine ring system from lone pair

351

electrons on the N atoms, double bonds in the imidazole ring, and carbonyl groups on C2 and C643

352

(Figure SI-1) but lacks significant conjugation across the molecule which contributes to its

353

photostability.

354

3.1.2

355

UV LEDs have historically been treated as monochromatic light sources, but by nature, UV LEDs

356

emit polychromatically over wavelength bands (i.e., Figure 2) which are much broader than

357

emittance range of traditional monochromatic (i.e., LP UV) light sources8. As such, we calculated

358

and compared both the polychromatic and monochromatic quantum yields (Φ) of each of the above

359

test compounds as previously described (Equation 2 & Equation 3; see Methods)46. Calculated

360

quantum yields can be found in Table 2 below. Quantum yields for urea were not calculated due

3.1.2.1 Comparison of Monochromatic and Polychromatic Quantum Yields

365

The calculated 95 % confidence intervals indicate that differences in monochromatic

366

(Φ6;5;,234,+ ) and polychromatic (Φ'$(),234,+ ) quantum yields were not statistically significant

367

within analytes (Table 2) but differences in mean values were > 10 % for UV-resistant compounds.

368

For example, Φ'$(),234,+ for pCBA and caffeine were mean 18.5 and 14.2 % higher than

369

Φ6;5;,234,+ , respectively, indicating that in these cases, monochromatic quantum yield

370

calculations may underestimate true quantum yield. In contrast, differences in monochromatic and

371

polychromatic values were less pronounced for UV-sensitive analytes. Φ'$(),234,+ was < 5 %

372

higher and < 1 % lower than Φ+$,$,234,+ for tryptophan and E1 respectively, indicating minimal

373

differences in monochromatic and polychromatic quantum yields for these compounds. Li et al.

374

(2022) found that monochromatic quantum yield calculations underestimated true quantum yield

375

values of chlorine species (HOCl & OCl-) by 5.66 – 14.63 % under 265 & 280 nm UV LED

376

irradiation47. In contrast, Pousty et al. (2022) determined that differences between polychromatic

377

and monochromatic quantum yields for uridine were negligible under 279 nm UV LED irradiation

378

and that the studied 279 nm UV LED could be treated as a quasi-monochromatic light source48.

379

Accordingly, there may be situations where UV LEDs can be treated as monochromatic light

380

sources without significant error, but this is almost certainly dependant on the emittance

381

wavelength and FWHM of the UV LED light source, as well as the chemical structure, molar

382

absorbance, and subsequent UV-sensitivity of the compound of interest. In most cases, it may be

383

most appropriate to treat these light sources as polychromatic unless the use case has been proven

384

otherwise for a particular light source and compound combination. In the section below,

385

Φ'$(),234,+ for all analytes was chosen to provide comparison to the literature.

386

3.1.2.2 Discussion of Quantum Yields for pCBA and Caffeine

387

Polychromatic and monochromatic quantum yields at 275nm (Φ'$(),234,+ & Φ+$,$,234,+ ) have

388

not previously been reported in the literature for the target compounds evaluated in this paper.

389

Calculated mean Φ'$(),234,+ for pCBA was 0.0278 mol Es-1 in this work (Table 2). Rosenfeldt &

390

Linden (2007) calculated monochromatic (LP UV; 254 nm) and polychromatic (MP UV; 200 –

391

300 nm) quantum yields of pCBA as 0.013 ± 0.002 mol Es-1 and 0.018 ± 0.004 mol Es-1,

392

respectively37 which are mean 72.5 and 42.8 % lower than is reported in this work. Similarly, Shu

393

et al. (2013) reported ΦCaffeine under MP UV irradiation as 0.0003 ± 0.001 mol Es-1 49 which is

394

nearly an order of magnitude lower than the calculated Φ'$(),234,+ for caffeine in this study

395

(0.00151 mol Es-1).

396

Differences in reported values could indicate wavelength dependence within these wavelength

397

ranges. Though this is unlikely for pCBA as molar absorbance of is substantially higher at 254 nm

398

in comparison to 275 nm (e = 3196 vs. 600 M-1 cm-1 for 254 nm and 275 nm, respectively), this

399

could contribute to discrepancies in quantum yield values for caffeine. Caffeine has an absorbance

400

peak at 274 nm (e = 9845 M-1 cm-1; current work) and another around 207 nm (e ≈ 25 000; Shu et

401

al. (2013)49). The emittance of the 275 nm reactor demonstrates 100 % overlap with the 274 nm

402

emittance band of caffeine, while MP UV light is intermittently distributed across the UVA, UVB,

403

+ UV C ranges (i.e., Figure 3). It may be that the peak 275 nm emittance band for the UV LED is

404

able to more effectively facilitate photochemical reactions by targeting the 274 nm absorbance

405

band of caffeine directly than is the spectral emittance of a MP UV lamp which would be

406

distributed across the UV spectrum (as is discussed further for E1 and 17b-E2 in Section 3 below).

407

Differences in light intensity could also explain variation between calculated values in the

408

literature. Linden & Darby (1997) showed that increasing light intensity in LPUV systems can

409

result in higher apparent quantum yields of uridine50, but only to a maximum value of 0.4 mW cm-

410

2

411

Rajesh et al. (2025) observed an over two-fold increase in quantum yield of dibromoacetonitile

412

under high power output vs. low power output 265 nm UV LEDs24. In this work, the calculated

413

fluence rate of the reactor under uridine actinometry was 249 mW cm-2. There are no commercially

414

available mercury-based systems and no other UV LED systems outside of the reactor type

, after which no further increase was observed up to a maximum of 3.2 mW cm-2. More recently,

415

employed in this study, which can produce such high intensity UV light. A conventional system

416

could theoretically be designed to deliver high intensity light but would inevitably also deliver so

417

much heat to a sample that it would be very challenging to mitigate the impact of heat on samples.

418

The kinetic and photochemical behaviour of analytes under this high-intensity UV light source are

419

most likely not directly comparable to lower intensity light sources. This concept warrants further

420

investigation to determine the impacts of drastically different intensities on degradation kinetics.

421

Further, the reactor used in this experiment is flow-through design and has not previously been

422

described for degradation of organic compounds using UV LEDs. The dynamics of each

423

experimental setup likely require individual considerations for the specific water chemistry that is

424

being investigated in an experiment.

425

3.1.2.3 Discussion of Quantum Yields for Tryptophan and E1

426

ΦTryptophan varies from below 0.01 to 0.35 based on currently published studies; Callus & Liu (2003)

427

discuss this may be related to differences in electron transfer caused by environmental variations

428

during measurement51. Calculated Φ'$(),234,+ for tryptophan in this study is within this range of

429

values (0.050 mol Es-1; Table 2) but it is relevant to note that the above reported values are based

430

on fluorescent quantum yield determinations over a variety of wavelength ranges vs. the time-

431

based kinetic quantum yield calculation method employed in this work46. Reported quantum yield

432

values for E1 in the literature are also variable and have been reported from 0.065 mol Es-1 (10 µg

433

L-1, LP UV irradiation52) to 0.35 ± 0.14 mol Es-1 (5 ug L-1, LP UV irradiation43) and as high as

434

5.14 mol Es-1 (1 mg L-1, LP UV irradiation53). It is unclear the cause of such large discrepancies

435

in the literature as all three example references above used the same method to calculate quantum

436

yield at the same irradiation wavelength, though Pereira et al. (2012) evaluated concentrations two

437

orders of magnitude or greater than the others described above. The calculated quantum yield for

438

E1 in this study is within the range demonstrated in the literature (Φ'$(),234,+ = 0.864 mol Es-1)

439

but further work is needed to explain if variation from values previously reported is due to

wavelength dependence (which is discussed further above and in Section 3), differences in

441

calculation, variation in light intensity (as described above), or other factors.

443

This work presents the first demonstration of kobs at 275 nm, Φ'$(),234,+ and Φ+$,$,234,+ for the

described compounds and demonstrates the potential of tailored photolysis processes for

445

degradation of TrOCs. This work also provides the first use and application of a novel, flow-

446

through UV LED reactor which allows for substantially higher sample throughput and lower

447

fluence delivery time as compared to traditional collimated beam setups (SI-Text 5, Figure SI-6).

448

This work identified that 275nm UV LED light was highly effective in the removal of E1 &

449

tryptophan by photolysis. Not all target compounds exhibited a similar susceptibility to

450

degradation at UV LED at 275nm. The combination of UV absorbance profile and chemical

451

structure of the target were the two primary governing factors when determining efficacy of

452

photolytic treatment and compounds with higher quantum yields were more susceptible to

453

photolytic degradation. Consideration of each of these features is key in developing bespoke UV

454

LEDs for robust and mercury-free water treatment approaches.

Summary of Findings

Part 2: Comparison of UV C LED and Medium-Pressure Mercury Vapour Photolysis
for Degradation of Steroid Hormones

457

In secondary experiments, E1 and another steroid estrogen, 17b-estradiol (17b-E2) were chosen

458

to assess the effectiveness of 275 nm LED irradiation and MP UV irradiation. E1 was chosen due

459

to its demonstration of photodegradability in Part 1 experiments. 17b-E2 was chosen based on its

460

similar structure and absorbance profile to E1 but comparative resistance to photodegradation in

461

comparison to its sister compound35,54. Further, both are environmentally relevant TrOCs which

462

cause endocrine disrupting effects in aquatic organisms55 and evaluation of effective treatment

463

techniques relevant to both municipal and agricultural sectors which are the primary producers of

464

estrogenic waste released into aquatic environments55–57. Secondary experiments were conducted

using traditional collimated beam setups described in the Methods. It is relevant to note that the

466

semiconductor chips in the collimated beam reactor evaluated here are paired with those used in

467

the flow-through reactor described in Section 2 experiments, meaning that the emittance spectrum

468

is identical for both systems.

469

E1 & 17b-E2 were degraded by both light sources but the MP UV system required substantially

470

higher fluence delivery to achieve comparable removal to the 275 nm UV LED system. The MP

471

UV light source also was unable to degrade 17b-E2 below detectable limits even at a fluence of

472

10 000 mJ cm-2 while complete (below detectable limits) removal was achieved at a fluence of

473

2000 mJ cm-2 using the 275nm UV LED light source. These data and the absorbance/emittance

474

spectra of the reactors and analytes are highlighted in Figure 3. Further, the MP UV system only

475

demonstrates 17% overlap in total light emission with the molar absorbance spectra of each

476

estrogen, whereas 275 nm UV LED emittance spectrum demonstrates 100 % overlap with the

477

lower absorbance band of each estrogen. This suggests that, while E1 is likely amenable to

478

photodegradation under MPUV light due to its relative photosensitivity throughout the UV

479

spectrum, MP UV degradation for 17b-E2 may be primarily driven by the generation of radical

480

species from light emitted in the far-UVC region which warrants further investigation. These

481

results show the importance of understanding the character of TrOCs, and tailoring of UV C light

482

sources, when considering UV LEDs vs MP UV treatment systems.

UV C LED and MP UV Degradation of E1

490

Φ'$(),234,+ and kobs for E1 were similar between 275 nm flow-through reactor (Part 1) and

491

collimated beam (Part 2) experiments, though 95 % confidence intervals indicate statistically

492

significant differences between values (Table 1, Table 3). The mean 15.8 % and 18 % difference

493

observed between first-order rate constants and quantum yields (respectively) is most likely due

494

to differences in reactor intensity (249 mW cm-2 (flow-through reactor) vs. 3.62 mW cm-2

495

(collimated beam)). We discussed the implications of this earlier in Section 2 as it pertains to

496

quantum yield and the same discussion would apply here. Similar phenomenon has also been

497

observed for degradation kinetics of other TrOCs; Rajesh et al. (2025) found that increasing the

498

incident irradiance of 265 nm UV LEDs resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in the kinetics rate constant

499

of dibromoacetonitrile even when controlling for fluence24.

503

UV (Figure 3). Fluence-based rate constants were > 3x higher (Table 3) and polychromatic

504

quantum yields were nearly ~ 4x higher under 275 nm irradiation as compared to MP UV (0.721

505

mol Es-1 (Φ'$(),234,+ ) vs 0.189 mol Es-1 (Φ'$(),<=>? )) indicating wavelength dependence within

506

the 200 – 310 nm region. As described in Section 2, E1 is known to undergo rapid

507

photodecomposition when exposed to light over wide ranges of the UV spectrum27,31–35 and so

508

effective degradation under both 275 nm and MP UV conditions would be expected. The more

509

effective degradation observed under 275 nm light is almost certainly due targeted nature of the

510

275 nm reactor emittance over the 281 nm absorbance band of E1 (Figure 3). The peak emittance

511

of the reactor and 281 nm absorbance band of the analyte are overlapping (peak reactor emittance

512

= 275 nm; peak E1 absorbance = 280 – 282 nm, e = 2569 M-1 cm-1) in comparison to the MP UV

513

lamp, which emits sporadically in the 200 – 300 nm primary absorbance range of E1 (Figure 3).

514

E1 also has an absorbance shoulder at ~ 220 nm (e = 7841 M-1 cm-1) and a second absorbance peak

515

at 203 nm (e = 30 146 M-1 cm-1), which could be theoretically targeted by the MP UV lamp. The

516

absorbance peak observed at 281 nm corresponds to E1’s lowest energy absorption band29. If a

517

photon is absorbed by a compound has energy sufficient to promote a compound to its first excited

518

state and result in a photochemical reaction, the absorption of photons of higher energy will not

519

increase the rate of a photochemical reaction and the additional energy will be lost as heat46.

520

Therefore, the light emission by the 275 nm reactor is more efficiently delivering photochemical

521

reactions for E1 removal than the MP UV lamp.

522

The same photoproduct of estrone as discussed in earlier experiments (consistent with lumiestrone)

523

was detected under both 275 nm and MP UV irradiation. Photoproduct dynamics under 275 nm

524

irradiation were similar to flow-through reactor experiments: peak photoproduct evolution was

525

observed at 250 mJ cm-2 as compared to 231 mJ cm-2 the 275 nm flow through reactor. The

526

photoproduct was non-detectable at a fluence of 5000 mJ cm-2 (Figure 4, Figure SI-5 B). In

527

contrast, peak photoproduct evolution was not observed until 2000 mJ cm-2 under MP UV and the

528

photoproduct was still observed at ~51 % of maximum peak response at highest fluence conditions

(5000 mJ cm-2; Figure 4, Figure SI-5 C). Accordingly, this tailored wavelength approach to

530

photolytic degradation demonstrates more rapid degradation of E1 and improved reduction in its

associated photoproduct as compared to MP UV irradiation.

UV C LED and Medium-Pressure Mercury Vapour Degradation of 17b-E2

535

3.2.2

536

17b-E2 was degraded by > 80% under 275 nm irradiation at 5% of the fluence required (500 mJ

537

cm-2) under MP UV (10 000 mJ cm-2), and > 90% under 275 nm irradiation at 10% of the fluence

538

required as compared to under MP UV (Figure 3). Complete (below detectable limits) degradation

539

was observed under 275 nm irradiation at a fluence of 2000 mJ cm-2. In contrast, 17b-E2 was still

540

detectable even at very high (i.e., 10 000 mJ cm-2) fluence conditions under MP UV irradiation.

541

Fluence-based rate constants were also more than an order of magnitude higher under 275 nm

542

irradiation (4.04 x 10-3 cm2 mJ-1 vs. 2.15 x 10-4 cm2 mJ-1 under 275 nm irradiation and MP UV

543

respectively) and the polychromatic quantum yield was ~ 5x higher under 275 nm irradiation

544

(0.125 mol Es-1 ( Φ'$(),234,+ ) vs 0.0244 mol Es-1 ( Φ'$(),<=>? )) indicating wavelength

545

dependence within the 200 – 310 nm region (Table 3).

546

17b-E2 has a very similar structure and absorbance profile to E1 with an absorbance band at 281

547

nm (e = 1498 M-1 cm-1), an absorbance shoulder at ~ 220 nm (e = 6129 M-1 cm-1) and second

548

absorbance band ~ 200 nm (e = 31 598 M-1 cm-2; Figure 3). It is likely that the same spectral

549

dynamics described above for E1 are also applicable to 17b-E2, i.e., targeted photochemical

550

activation of the lower energy band (~280 nm) by the 275 nm UV C LED can more effectively

551

evoke photochemical reactions than is the polychromatic distribution of light by the MP UV light

552

source. In this case, the reduction in required fluence over commercially available systems is

553

significant (to be redundant, 10 % of the required fluence to achieve 90 % degradation) which has

554

meaningful implications for stakeholders looking for mercury-free UV treatment options to

555

remediate estrogenic compounds (i.e., agriculture, pharmaceutical, municipal, among others55).

559

cost differences between the two systems (Equation 6, see Methods). Both analytes were degraded

560

at a significantly higher rate under 275 nm irradiation (Table 3) than the MP UV system. The waste

561

heat energy is directed in the same direction as light energy for MP UV systems imparting practical

562

upper boundary conditions for the MP UV system that would not exist for the UV LED system (in

563

which heat and light energy move in opposing directions). High (> 2000 mJ cm-2) fluence

564

conditions would be impractical or impossible in a full-scale MP UV system. Nonetheless, for

565

illustrative purpose, EEO values were 25 % higher under 275 nm irradiation for E1 (mean 1.31

566

and 1.02 kwh m-3 order-1 for the 275 nm UV C LED and MP UV lamp respectively; Table 4) while

567

energy usage was reduced by over four-fold for 17b-E2 under 275 nm conditions with the current

568

3.5 % WPE UV C LED system (2.66 vs 11.34 kwh m-3 order-1 for the 275 nm UV LED and MP

569

UV lamp respectively). This represents significant potential for direct UV LED photolysis system

570

that is neither practically possible for mercury UV systems and theoretically more efficient for

571

17b-E2 with current LED technology.

Prospects for UV C LEDs as a Climate Robust Treatment Technology

UV C LEDs have confirmed effectiveness for full-scale disinfection in drinking water and

577

applications. Limitations on their wide-spread use have largely been related to historical

578

constraints in power output and energy efficiency. Power outputs of UV C LEDs have improved

579

by over two orders of magnitude (139x) in the last ten years8, and current efficiency limitations,

580

particularly for UV C LEDs, are not due to the fundamental quantum mechanics of the system but

581

technological limitations6. It is projected that technological advances could see the development

582

of more WP efficient UV C LEDs within the next ten years6 which would only increase practical

583

capability to disrupt water treatment design possibilities.

584

This work demonstrates the significant use potential of UV C LEDs for removing steroid estrogens

585

from water. Estrogenic compounds are used as feed additives or implants in aquaculture35,59–61 and

586

agriculture systems55,62 (respectively), as active ingredients in oral contraceptives and hormone

587

replacement therapies55,63, and are also present naturally in the human body. These scenarios result

588

in significant inputs of estrogens into municipal treatment plants and the global environment.

589

Steroid estrogens are often not effectively removed or degraded by standard treatment practices

590

employed at municipal wastewater treatment plants64–68 and these compounds require the addition

591

of chemical agents (to facilitate AOPs), high-pressure membranes (e.g., reverse osmosis (RO) or

592

nanofiltration (NF)), adsorbent materials (e.g., granular activated carbon (GAC)) or ion exchange

593

technologies) to effectively remediate69. In the latter cases, processes result in secondary waste

594

streams (e.g., membrane concentrate, exhausted adsorbent, spent ion-exchange resin) which need

595

to be further treated, regenerated, or disposed of, resulting in significant cost, materials waste, and

596

carbon footprint. The current work illustrates the substantial promise of UV LEDs to provide

597

effective, chemical-free, bespoke treatment of steroid estrogens with no secondary waste streams

598

and tailoring in wavelength emittance could see similar applications for a wide range of concerning

599

contaminants.

600

Future potential could see bespoke UV LED technology design for even recalcitrant compounds

601

such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which require large energy inputs to break C-

602

F bonds (96.8 – 131.6 kcal mol-1 70). This is no longer an impossibility with current technology

trajectory. It is possible for LEDs to approach 100 % WPE under ideal scenarios71 and current

604

limitations are technological and not fundamental6. By the early 21st century, SSLE devices had

605

largely replaced technological illumination alternatives in consumer products such as vacuum

606

tubes and pressured gases due to their improved efficiency, reliability, longer lifetime, and cost

607

effectiveness in comparison to historical counterparts. It is inevitable that the same will be the case

608

for UV LED replacement of mercury-vapour lamps in water treatment. Ultraviolet diodes are on a

609

similar trajectory as visible light diodes were several decades ago. Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) were

610

the primary display technology throughout the mid 20th and early 21st century. The onset of LED-

611

based displays ushered the emergence of 1080p as a standard resolution for televisions and

612

monitors in the early 2010’s which resulted in the displacement of CRT televisions. 4k display are

613

now repeating this cycle with 1080p screens. UV LEDs are now at the tipping point of displacing

614

an established technology for disinfection with the use of full-scale UV LED disinfection. This

615

work makes it possible to imagine how advancement in UV LED technology will foster

616

algorithmic-driven water treatment, dual-purpose disinfection/photolysis reactors, and dynamic

617

adjustment of emitted wavelength(s) in large-scale reactors.

618

619

UV LEDs are a proven breakthrough technology that have significant potential beyond traditional

620

applications such as UV disinfection. This work marks the first characterization, use and

621

implementation of a novel, bench-scale tailored photolytic UV LED reactor. The specific unit that

622

was used in this work contained all 275nm peak emittance UV C LEDs but could be customized

623

to suit any of the currently available UV LED outputs making them broadly applicable to most

624

contaminant degradation applications. Moreover, far-UV C LEDs have more recently become

625

commercially available and expands the design space of tailored treatment approaches for

626

recalcitrant compounds such as PFAS.

627

This characterization study using six different target compounds demonstrated the unique features

628

that tailored light output provides. Estrogenic and amino acid compounds were most susceptible

629

to degradation at 275nm while targets such as caffeine, pCBA, and urea were largely unaffected

630

by exposure to 275nm light. This result suggests that choosing the correct light source to treat

631

target compounds is an important consideration when designing larger photolysis systems using

632

UV LEDs. Evaluation of chemical structure and molar absorbance is necessary to provide an

633

adequate assessment of treatment capabilities and choice of light source, while quantum yield is

634

an excellent proxy for potential treatment outcome and can help to infer potential energy

635

requirements24.

636

Secondary experiments comparing 275 nm UV C LEDs and a MPUV system further demonstrated

637

the utility of the tailored treatment platform. For 17b-E2, 90% degradation was achieved at

638

fluences 1/10th of that required for similar degradation using the MP UV system. In the case of E1,

639

both the analyte and its associated photoproduct were degraded rapidly under 275 nm irradiation,

640

while E1 degradation rates were significantly lower under MP UV irradiation and the associated

641

photoproduct persisted at even high (5000 mJ cm-2) fluences. Furthermore, the EEO for 17b-E2

642

using the 275 nm UV C LED system was about 4-fold lower that of the MP UV system when using

643

a WPE of 3.5 % (UV C LED) and 15% (MP UV system) respectively. WPE of UV C LEDs is

644

expected to increase substantially in the next ten years6 which would drastically reduce the energy

645

needs of these systems when compared to conventional mercury lamps in this scenario. This result

646

indicates that tailored use of UV light to treat target compounds can overcome some of the current

647

technological limitations that LEDs have when compared to conventional systems. This benefit is

648

in addition to the many environmental considerations that have been highlighted in this work.

649

Overall, this work shows a novel tool for conducting tailored UV exposure experiments at the

650

bench-scale, determines several previously unreported quantum yields for TrOCs, and provides

651

the groundwork for scaling these technologies via the calculation of energy requirements needed

652

for UV C LEDs when compared to conventional alternatives. The use of tailored UV C LED

653

reactors will lead to a future that does not require the use of chlorine, ozone, or peroxide for the

654

removal of emergent contaminants while also removing mercury from the treatment process. This
