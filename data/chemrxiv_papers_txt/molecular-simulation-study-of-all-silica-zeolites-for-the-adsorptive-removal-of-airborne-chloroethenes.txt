Abstract
Chloroethenes (C2H4-xClx with x = 1, 2, 3, 4) are produced and consumed in various industrial
processes. As the release of these compounds into air, water, and soils can pose significant
risks to human health and the environment, different techniques have been exploited to prevent
or remediate chloroethene pollution. Although several previous experimental and
computational studies investigated the removal of chloroethenes using zeolite adsorbents,
their structural diversity in terms of pore size and pore topology has hardly been explored so
far. In this work, molecular simulations using validated empirical force field parameters were
used to study the gas-phase adsorption of chloroethenes in 16 structurally distinct zeolite
frameworks. As all these frameworks are synthetically accessible in high-silica form, the
simulations used purely siliceous zeolite models. In the most relevant concentration range (0.1
to 10 ppm by volume), substantial uptakes of tri- and tetrachloroethene were computed for
several zeolite frameworks, prominently EUO, IFR, MTW, MOR, and BEA. In contrast, vinyl
chloride uptakes were always too low to be of practical relevance for adsorptive removal. For
selected frameworks, simulation snapshots were analyzed to investigate the impact of pore
shape and, at higher uptakes, guest-guest interactions on the adsorption behavior. Hence, this
study not only identifies zeolites that should be prioritized in future investigations, but also
contributes to the microscopic understanding of chloroethene adsorption in crystalline
microporous materials.

Introduction
Chloroethenes (abbreviated CEs throughout this article) of the general formula C2H4-xClx with
x = 1, 2, 3, 4 are widely used in various industrial processes:1 The monosubstituted form, vinyl
chloride (chloroethene), one of the world’s most important commodity chemicals, is primarily
used as monomer in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a widespread and versatile
polymer. Among the three dichloroethene isomers, 1,1-dichloroethene also finds use as
monomer in the synthesis of polymers. The cis and trans forms of 1,2-dichloroethene, which
occur as byproducts in some processes, are in limited demand, with niche applications as
solvents and cleaning agents. In contrast, trichloroethene is rather widely used, primarily in the
degreasing of metal parts and as intermediate in the production of hydrofluorocarbons and
other chemicals, with additional applications including industrial dry cleaning and the
production of inks and paints. Finally, tetrachloroethene is applied in similar fields, notably in
dry cleaning, as degreasing agent, and as feedstock in industrial syntheses. IUPAC names,
frequently used synonyms and abbreviations as well as selected thermophysical properties of
CEs are compiled in Table 1.

It is established that various health hazards are associated with airborne CEs, even at relatively
low levels. In addition to acute toxicity at high concentrations, long-term exposure may have
negative health consequences. For example, VC has been reported to cause liver damage,
nerve damage, and immunological dysfunction, moreover, it is known to be a human

carcinogen.3,4 Whereas data regarding toxicity and mutagenicity/carcinogenicity of DCE
isomers are relatively sparse,5,6 it is established that TCE can cause both acute and chronic
toxic effects, it has also been classified as carcinogenic.7,8 For PCE, neurotoxic effects caused
by long-term exposure are most concerning, and carcinogenic effects are suspected.3,9 Due to
these negative health impacts, limits for the workplace exposure to airborne CEs have been
introduced in many countries. For example, Directive 2019/130 of the European Union sets
the acceptable long-term exposure limits (reference timeframe: 8 hours) for VC and TCE to 1
and 10 parts per million (ppm) by volume, respectively.10 In Australia, long-term exposure limits
are 5 ppm for VC and 1,1-DCE, 10 ppm for TCE, 50 ppm for PCE, and 200 ppm for 1,2-DCE.11
Indoor air pollution by CEs is of most significance in facilities where these compounds are
produced and/or used (e.g., production plants, dry cleaners, etc.), although outgassing of CEcontaining products may also play a role. Besides, the pollution of different environmental
compartments by CEs has raised concern with regard to potential negative effects on human
health and the environment. The main sources of VC in the environment are emissions and
effluents from plastic industries, with hazardous waste sites and natural gas extraction sites
making additional contributions.4 In addition to these point sources, there have been a number
of large-scale VC spills,6 the most notorious recent example being the derailment of a freight
train transporting VC, among other hazardous chemicals, in East Palestine, Ohio (USA) in
February 2023.12 Due to its high vapor pressure, most of the VC released to water or soils will
volatilize quickly. In air, it degrades photochemically within a few days.4 While being of less
concern due to their smaller production volumes, the DCE isomers have release pathways and
environmental behavior similar to VC, with reductive dehalogenation of TCE and PCE to
(mostly) cis-1,2-DCE being an additional source of DCE in the environment.5,6 TCE is primarily
released into the atmosphere by evaporation from degreasing operations and other industrial
uses, resulting in higher atmospheric TCE levels in industrial areas as compared to rural
regions.7,8 Although it mostly volatilizes from water and soils, it may also enter subsurface
areas, where it is relatively persistent. The most significant release of PCE arises from fugitive
emissions of the dry cleaning industry, with emissions related to degreasing and other solvent
uses also playing a role.9 Due to its long atmospheric half-life of several months, PCE has
been detected in remote locations, far away from emission sources. Disposal of PCEcontaminated sludges and filters contributes to the pollution of soil and groundwater, where it
is very persistent. Both TCE and PCE have been classified as “emerging outdoor airborne
pollutants” in a recent survey that aimed to identify pollutants of particular importance for better
monitoring and future policy development.13 Among a total of 262 emerging pollutants, TCE
and PCE were proposed for the second-highest prioritization category, behind only acrylonitrile
and 1,3-butadiene (and having the same priority as toluene and arsenic).

In industrial processes, gaseous emissions of CEs are typically collected and incinerated, and
air- or steam-stripping are used to separate CEs from industrial wastewaters prior to
incineration of the gas.1 For facilities where incineration is not possible, removal processes
using adsorption, absorption, or condensation have been proposed, and a number of patents
have been awarded in this area for VC removal in particular (see ref. 471 in [1] for an overview).
Regarding adsorption-based processes, activated carbons (ACs) and other carbonaceous
materials have been widely characterized as suitable adsorbents for the removal of CEs from
the gas phase14–21 and from aqueous solution.22–30
Zeolites, crystalline microporous materials having a tetrahedral framework structure, have
been investigated altogether less frequently than carbons. Nevertheless, a number of
experimental studies have addressed the adsorption of TCE and PCE using zeolites.
Specifically, Giaya et al. compared Silicalite-1, an all-silica zeolite having the MFI framework
type,31 a dealuminated zeolite Y (FAU framework), and an AC in terms of their TCE and PCE
adsorption behavior, both for the gas phase and for aqueous solution.32,33 In addition to
observing high uptakes of both species in Silicalite-1 in the ppm range, they also demonstrated
that co-adsorption of water affected CE adsorption in the all-silica zeolite much less than in the
other two adsorbents, a finding that was attributed to its high hydrophobicity. In an investigation
focused on cationic zeolites, Na-containing FAU-type zeolites with low Si/Al ratios (1.2 and
2.4) were found to be efficient adsorbents for the removal of PCE from dry gas streams.34
However, it was also noted that humidity would have to be removed prior to PCE adsorption,
as water adsorption had a detrimental effect on adsorbent performance. Besides adsorptive
removal, it was proposed to employ zeolites as catalysts for the oxidative destruction of CEs
in the gas phase.35–37
A number of other investigations looked at gas-phase CE adsorption in zeolites from a more
fundamental point of view.38–47 In particular, Mellot, Chihara and co-workers investigated the
adsorption of TCE and PCE (along with other chlorinated hydrocarbons) in FAU samples
having different Si/Al ratios and obtained via different dealumination routes.39,42 The
experimental investigations were complemented by molecular simulations (see below). The
impact of relative humidity on TCE and PCE adsorption capacities of FAU-type zeolites was
also studied.41,44,45 Although it was generally observed that more hydrophobic zeolites (higher
Si/Al ratios) possess higher uptake capacities, increasing diffusion limitations in highly
siliceous samples were highlighted in one of the studies. Detailed investigations revealed a
rather unusual adsorption behavior of PCE in MFI-type zeolites, with the adsorption isotherm
showing two steps.40 Different researchers have attributed this phenomenon to the adsorption
of PCE in distinct regions of the pore40,43 and to structural transitions of the framework with
increasing pressure.46,47

The ability of zeolite adsorbents to remove CEs from aqueous solution has received
considerable attention.48–52 To limit the co-adsorption of water, these investigations typically
focused on highly siliceous zeolites. For example, Silicalite-1 membranes grown on steel
supports were proposed for the removal of trans-1,2-DCE and TCE from water.50,51 Other
authors used zeolites as “dual-function” materials that allow for a catalytic decomposition of
the CEs after adsorption.49 In a very recent pilot-scale study by Georgi and co-workers, a Feloaded MFI-type zeolite was used together with an AC adsorber for the removal of hydrophilic
chlorinated hydrocarbons including VC from contaminated groundwater.52 The zeolite could be
regenerated several times by flushing with H2O2, degrading the adsorbed contaminants in a
Fenton-like reaction. Since the zeolite removed those compounds that break through the AC
early, the operation time of the AC adsorber could be expanded significantly. This last example
shows that zeolites may not necessarily be attractive as a stand-alone solution for contaminant
removal, not least due to their high cost, but that usage in conjunction with other materials
and/or techniques may constitute an attractive option.
In comparison to experimental studies of CE adsorption in zeolites, the number of
investigations employing atomistic simulations is relatively limited. Complementing their
experiments, Mellot, Chihara and co-workers used Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with
empirical force field parameters to investigate the role of guest-guest interactions between coadsorbed TCE molecules on the heat of adsorption in FAU-type zeolites.39 In subsequent work,
they employed different models for zeolite Y, comparing a defect-free model to models
containing an acid site (framework proton) and a silanol nest, respectively.42 For the more
silica-rich composition studied (Si/Al ratio = 70), the computed heats of TCE and PCE
adsorption were almost independent of the presence of acid sites or silanol nests, differing by
not more than 2 kJ mol−1. Adsorption isotherms were calculated using MC simulations in the
grand-canonical ensemble (GCMC), showing satisfactory agreement with experiment.
Ahunbay53 and Jeffroy et al.46,47 employed MC simulations to rationalize steps in the PCE
adsorption isotherms obtained for MFI-type adsorbents, with the former author also using
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict TCE and PCE diffusion coefficients. The role
of Si/Al ratio and of water co-adsorption on TCE adsorption was investigated, again for the
case of MFI-type zeolites, by means of GCMC simulations.54 As in earlier studies, it was
observed that hydrophilic areas (acid sites) in the zeolite structure have only a limited impact
on the affinity towards TCE, while reducing the available pore space due to the preferred
adsorption of water in these regions. A computationally efficient approach based on the
calculation of Henry’s law constants (dubbed “Henry constants” in the following) through
random insertion was pursued by Yazaydin and Thompson.55 These authors compared the
affinities of four zeolites (MFI, BEA, FAU, MOR) to 1,1-DCE, proposing BEA as most promising
adsorbent for 1,1-DCE removal due to its high Henry constant (= high affinity).

Although a large number of topologically distinct framework types are available in high-silica
or even all-silica form, the structural diversity of zeolites in terms of pore size and pore topology
has hardly been explored in the context of CE adsorption. The present study aims to fill this
gap, employing a combination of Henry constant simulations and GCMC simulations to study
the adsorption of all species listed in Table 1 in 16 all-silica zeolites. These particular
frameworks were selected for the following reasons: (1) They can by synthesized in pure-silica
or high-silica form.31,56 (2) They possess different pores sizes and connectivities. (3) According
to preliminary simulations, described below, their pore apertures are large enough to permit
the diffusion of all CE molecules. Through GCMC simulations for very low partial pressures,
conclusions regarding the potential suitability of zeolites to remove trace amounts (down to
sub-ppm range) of CEs are drawn. Moreover, a closer look is taken at simulation snapshots in
order to elucidate the microscopic origins of the observed affinities of selected frameworks.

Materials and Methods
Models of zeolites and guest molecules, force field parameters
Throughout this work, zeolites are designated solely by their framework type code (FTC).31
The 16 frameworks that are in the focus of this study are listed in Table 2, grouped according
to the size of the pore apertures. Four of the frameworks have channel systems lined by 10membered rings of SiO4 tetrahedra (10MR), eight have 12MR pore openings, and two
frameworks have pore systems consisting of both 12MR and 10MR channels. Finally, CFI and
DON are “extra-large-pore” zeolites with 14MR channels. In addition to these 16 frameworks,
the CHA framework was included in validation calculations for N2 and ETH. As this zeolite has
8MR pore openings, larger CEs like PCE cannot diffuse through the pore windows. Preliminary
simulations of CE adsorption were performed for three other zeolites having 10MR windows,
FER, MEL, and MWW. Unlike for the 16 zeolites listed in Table 2, interaction energy maps
derived from the calculations indicated high energy barriers to diffusion of PCE, the heaviest
CE, through the pore openings of these three zeolites. For this reason, FER, MEL, and MWW
were not considered further.
All zeolite models were optimized using the GULP code57 and potential parameters developed
by Sanders, Leslie, and Catlow (SLC).58 The majority of the SLC-optimized zeolite models
were already used in a previous study, where information on the experimental structure data
taken as starting points for the GULP calculations is provided.59 The newly optimized
frameworks are listed in the following, including labels of type materials and references to
experimental structure data: MTT (ZSM-2360), TUN (TNU-961), EUO (EU-162), MEI (ZSM-1863),
IWR (ITQ-24 64), and MSE (MCM-6865), as well as CHA.66 The optimized cell parameters are

The structures of ETH and all CEs were optimized using parameters of the PCFF force
field,67,68 and the N2 molecule was optimized using COMPASS parameters (although this force
field is proprietary, parameters for certain small molecules are freely available69,70). The
Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters and partial charges from these force fields were also used to
represent these molecules in the adsorption simulations. For the framework, two different sets
of LJ parameters and charges were compared, namely, (1) the original PCFF parameters and
(2) the potential parameters proposed by Emami et al. for use with PCFF (labelled
PCFF/Emami throughout this work).71 As is standard for PCFF and COMPASS, a 9-6 form of
the Lennard-Jones potential was used, and 6th-power combination rules were employed to
compute parameters representing interactions between non-identical atom types.72 PCFF
parameters have been used in previous studies addressing the adsorption and diffusion of
CEs in zeolites.54,73 Charges and LJ parameters are compiled in Table SII.

Henry constant simulations
Henry constant simulations employed the Monte Carlo (MC) method in the uniform ensemble,
in which single guest molecules are inserted at random, and the total energies obtained for a
sufficiently large ensemble of configurations are used to compute the Henry constant KH.74 The
selectivity towards a binary mixture of two species A and B in the limit of infinite dilution (zero
coverage) can be calculated from the Henry constants as:75
𝑆=

𝐾 (A)
𝐾 (B)

The isosteric heat of adsorption qst in the limit of zero coverage can also be derived from these
simulations as detailed by June et al.74
All Henry constant calculations were done for a temperature of 298 K, using the Sorption
module of the DS BIOVIA Materials Studio suite. The simulations used 25 million insertion
steps, after ensuring that a further increase of the number of steps (up to 100 million steps)
resulted in no significant change in the Henry constants. Using partial charges and LJ
parameters as described above, Coulomb interactions were computed using the Ewald &
charge group summation method with a cutoff of 18.5 Å, and van der Waals (vdW) interactions
were evaluated using a pairwise summation, employing a cutoff of 18.5 Å and a spline-based
truncation with a spline width of 1 Å.

Grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations
Monte Carlo simulations in the grand-canonical (µVT) ensemble (GCMC), which also used the
Sorption module, were performed to calculate single-component adsorption isotherms for ETH
and all CEs in a fugacity range from 10-5 kPa to 1 kPa (T = 298 K).
In addition to delivering the average number of particles per simulation cell <N> for given
conditions, these simulations also allow to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption according
to:76

𝑞 ,

=𝑅∙𝑇−

𝜕𝑈
𝜕𝑁

In this equation, which assumes ideal gas behavior of the fluid phase, R represents the ideal
gas constant and the term in brackets corresponds to the change in total energy U upon
change of the number of particles. As both host-guest and guest-guest interactions contribute
to U, the heat of adsorption is loading-dependent.

These simulations used 10 million equilibration steps and 20 million production steps.
Moreover, simulations of binary mixture adsorption were performed for VC/N2, PCE/N2, and
TCE/N2 mixtures, assuming the same fugacity range for the CEs and fixing the fugacity of N2
to 101.325 kPa (T = 298 K). The number of equilibration and production steps was doubled in
simulations of mixture adsorption. In all GCMC simulations, the probabilities of different types
of MC moves were set to 2 : 1 : 1 : 0.1 for exchange (insertion/deletion) : translation : rotation
: regrowth moves, and the amplitudes of translation and rotation moves were rescaled to arrive
at an acceptance probability of 0.5. To generate snapshots for adsorption simulations, MC
simulations in the canonical ensemble (NVT) were performed for relevant loadings of the guest
molecules of interest, using otherwise analogous settings as in the GCMC simulations.
Charges, LJ parameters, and summation methods were the same as described above in the
Henry constant calculations. However, the cutoff distances were reduced to 12.5 Å to avoid
the necessity to use very large supercells (the size of the supercells used in both types of
simulations is compiled in Table SI). It was verified that a reduction of the cutoffs had only a
small impact on the heat of adsorption, with changes in qst on the order of one to four per cent.
In all Henry constant and MC simulations, zeolite framework atoms were held fixed and guest
molecules were treated as rigid. To enhance the efficiency of the simulations, the insertion of
the guest molecules was limited to the accessible part of the zeolite pores. The Create
Segregates tool of Materials Studio was used to create a volumetric representation of the
accessible part of the pore space.

Results and discussion
Force field validation
Figure 1 compares the isosteric heats of adsorption qst obtained from Henry constant
calculations using the original PCFF parameters and PCFF/Emami parameters to
experimental values. The comparison covers N2, ETH, TCE, and PCE in FAU and MFI as well
as N2 and ETH in all-silica CHA. As Figure 1 shows, agreement between simulation and
experiment is good to excellent for 9 out of 10 datapoints, with the outlier being ETH@FAU
(grey box). In this case, the calculated heats of ethene adsorption are about 30% lower than
the experimental value. A potential origin of this discrepancy may be the use of a FAU-type
sample dealuminated under harsh conditions in the experimental study, which is likely to
contain a rather large amount of defects that might act as preferential adsorption sites for
ETH.38 Since agreement between experiment and simulation is considerably better for all other
cases, it seems reasonable to discard this datapoint. A calculation of the overall error for PCFF,

using the remaining datapoints, delivers a mean of signed errors (MSE) of −1.9 kJ/mol and a
mean of unsigned errors (MUE) of 2.0 kJ/mol. For PCFF/Emami, the MSE amounts to
0.0 kJ/mol and the MUE to 1.4 kJ/mol. Although the difference in MUE is not large, the MSE is
significantly reduced when using PCFF/Emami parameters, indicating that, unlike for PCFF,
there is no systematic underestimation of the heats of adsorption. In the view of the very good
agreement, all calculations reported in the following used PCFF parameters for ethene and
chlorinated ethenes, COMPASS parameters for N2, and parameters proposed by Emami et al.
for Si and O atoms.

Figure 1: Comparison of simulated heat of adsorption to experimental data. Experimental values are
from the following sources (in order of increasing qst,exp): N2@FAU: ref. 77, N2@CHA and N2@MFI: ref.
78, ETH@FAU: ref. 38, ETH@CHA: ref. 79, ETH@MFI: ref. 80, TCE@FAU and PCE@FAU: ref. 42,
TCE@MFI: ref. 40, PCE@MFI: ref. 47. For CHA and MFI, purely siliceous samples were studied,
whereas investigations on FAU-type systems typically involved highly dealuminated zeolite Y samples.

Henry constants and heats of adsorption at zero coverage
The full results of the Henry constant calculations are compiled in the Supplementary
Information (Table S1.1 in EXCEL file KH_and_GCMC_results.xslx). Figure 2 illustrates
typical trends in Henry constant KH (shown on a logarithmic scale) and in the heat of adsorption
qst,sim for five zeolites, two with 10 MR pore systems (MFI, MTT) and three having 12MR pores
(EUO, FAU, MOR). In addition to plotting the evolution for CH4-xClx species as a function of the
number of Cl atoms, results for N2 are also included. It is clearly visible that the affinity towards
all hydrocarbons is higher than for N2 and that the interaction strength increases with
10

increasing number of Cl atoms, which is straightforwardly explained with the contribution of the
polarizable Cl atoms to attractive vdW interactions. Among the different zeolites, the variation
in affinity also increases: While the KH values for ETH span only one order of magnitude, they
extend over three orders of magnitude for PCE. The KH values for N2 fall close together,
indicating that the Henry’s law selectivities for heavier CEs over N2 will vary widely, as will be
shown in more detail in the following subsection. For most zeolite-guest combinations, a close
correlation between ln(KH) and qst is apparent. An exception is visible for the heaviest CEs
adsorbed in MTT, where the isosteric heat still increases when moving from TCE to PCE,
whereas the Henry constant decreases. This can be attributed to the relatively narrow channels
of MTT, for which the fraction that is accessible to TCE is significantly larger than for the more
voluminous PCE molecule.

Henry’s law selectivities
Table S1.2 of the supplementary EXCEL file contains Henry’s law selectivities for a) ETH and
CEs over N2, b) CEs over ETH, and c) trans-1,2-DCE over the other DCE isomers. Focus in
this discussion will be placed on the selectivities for VC, TCE, and PCE over N2, which are
compiled in Figure 3. For VC, a number of zeolites show selectivities on the order of 500 to
950, with EUO and TON being most selective. Among the four zeolites that are commercially
available in high-silica form (MFI, BEA, FAU, and MOR), MFI exhibits the highest selectivity.
For TCE and PCE, variations are much more pronounced, with the computed selectivities
spanning several orders of magnitude. TON, EUO, and MTW are most selective for TCE, with
S(TCE/N2) on the order of 106, whereas MOR and MFI are the best commercially available
zeolites with selectivities of about 3·105. PCE/N2 selectivities exceeding 107 are predicted for
EUO, MTW, and MOR, followed by IFR.

Figure 3: Henry’s law selectivities for VC (top), TCE (middle), and PCE (bottom) over N2. A logarithmic
scale is used for TCE and PCE. From left to right, different colors are used to represent zeolites with
10MR, 12MR, 10+12MR, and 14MR pore openings.

When looking at the pore system information listed in Table 2, it is noteworthy that the highest
selectivities are predicted for frameworks possessing 1D pore systems of 12MR or 10MRs. A
combination of 10+12MR pore openings does not appear to enhance the selectivity for any of
the CEs studied. Regarding the numerical pore descriptors d(LIS), d(LDS), and Vocc, there is
no clear-cut correlation between any of these quantities and the CE/N2 selectivities shown in
Figure 3. When considering that the pore size descriptors d(LIS) and d(LDS) are calculated
for spherical probe molecules, whereas the CE molecules are distinctly non-spherical, this
observation is hardly surprising. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the zeolites that are
predicted to be most selective towards CEs typically have pore systems characterized by a
diameter of the largest sphere that does not exceed 7.2 Å, and a diameter of the largest
diffusing sphere that falls between 5 and 6.5 Å. However, the reverse is not true; not all zeolites
having d(LIS) and d(LDS) values in this range achieve high selectivities. As will be shown in
more detail later, intricate features of the pore shape are responsible for the exceptionally high
affinity of frameworks like EUO and MTW towards CEs.
Taking the full body of results compiled in Table S1.2 into consideration, the following
additional observations may be useful for future work:


Predicted selectivities for ETH over N2 are moderate, with the largest values on the
order of 20 occurring for MTT, MTW, and EUO.



The trends in CE/ETH selectivities are largely analogous to those presented above for
CE/N2 mixtures.



The EUO, TON, IFR, and MTW frameworks exhibit the highest selectivities for DCE
isomers over nitrogen.

 Regarding differences in affinity towards the DCE isomers, the 10MR zeolites MFI,
MTT, and especially TON exhibit the highest preference for trans-1,2-DCE over other
isomers, with TON reaching trans-1,2-DCE/1,1-DCE and trans-1,2-DCE/cis-1,2-DCE
selectivities of 7.0 and 3.1, respectively. Since the present work considered only those
10MR zeolites for which diffusion of larger CEs like PCE is possible, excluding several
others like FER, MEL, and MWW, it seems worthwhile to perform a more extensive
computational screening of 10MR zeolites when aiming to find optimized zeolite
adsorbents for DCE isomer separation.

CE uptakes at low concentrations
As shown in the previous section, the CE/N2 selectivities in the limit of zero coverage become
very large for large CEs like TCE and PCE. However, as the target application is the removal
13

of trace amounts, rather than bulk separation, these numbers give only limited insights into the
potential usefulness of different zeolite frameworks for CE removal. In this regard, the uptake
at low CE concentrations (= low fugacities) under ambient conditions is more relevant. To
address this, adsorption isotherm simulations were performed for ETH and all CEs for a
fugacity range from 10-5 to 1 kPa. In addition to computing single-component adsorption
isotherms, simulations of VC/N2, TCE/N2, and PCE/N2 co-adsorption were carried out, in which
the fugacity of N2 was set to 101.325 kPa. Assuming ideal gas behavior, the partial pressures
of the CEs in these mixtures correspond to concentrations ranging from 0.1 ppm to 10,000
ppm (1 vol%). Full adsorption isotherms are shown in Tables S2.1 to S2.16 of the
supplementary EXCEL file. For the present discussion, uptakes at 10−5, 10−3, and 1 kPa are
visualized in Figures 4 (VC) and 5 (TCE and PCE), focusing on the four commercially available
zeolites and four frameworks exhibiting particularly high selectivities, TON, EUO, IFR, and
MTW.

Figure 4: VC uptakes at different pressures obtained from VC adsorption simulations (solid columns)
and VC/N2 mixture adsorption simulations (shaded columns).

The first thing that is worth noting when looking at the two figures is the close match of CE
uptakes obtained from single-component adsorption simulations with those obtained from
14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-w6kxl-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5133-1537 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

CE/N2 mixture simulations, with the reduction in CE uptake induced by N2 co-adsorption never
exceeding 20%. It can be inferred that the presence of nitrogen has only an insignificant impact
on the attainable CE uptake, and that single-component adsorption simulations should thus be
sufficient for the systems and conditions considered here. With this in mind, the ETH and DCE
isotherms that are reported in the Supplementary Information, but not discussed in detail in
this article, might be of use as starting points for future investigations.
As shown in Figure 4, EUO and IFR, followed by TON and MFI, take up the largest amounts
of VC at 10−5 and 10−3 kPa. Even for these frameworks, however, the adsorbed amounts are
very small, on the order of 10−5 and 10−3 mmol g−1, respectively, at the two pressures. This
indicates that none of the zeolites is particularly attractive for the removal of VC in the ppm
range. At 1 kPa, most of the zeolites adsorb significant amounts of VC, with the uptake of IFR
exceeding 1 mmol g−1. However, such a high concentration of 1 mol% is not relevant for the
removal of trace amounts.

Figure 5: TCE and PCE uptakes at different pressures obtained from single-component adsorption
simulations (solid columns) and CE/N2 mixture adsorption simulations (shaded columns).

Compared to VC, the uptakes of TCE and PCE computed for low pressures (Figure 5) are
much higher. Although the trends for the two species are similar, the uptakes at 10−5 kPa are
about one order of magnitude larger for PCE due to stronger host-guest interactions. EUO and
MTW are predicted to adsorb the largest amounts of TCE and PCE at this pressure and should
thus be best suited for their removal in the sub-ppm range. Among the commercially available
zeolites, MFI has the most beneficial properties for TCE removal, whereas MOR should
perform better in PCE removal. At a pressure of 10−3 kPa, IFR exhibits the highest uptakes of
both gases, which amount to 1.0 and 1.7 mmol g−1 for TCE and PCE, respectively. EUO
constitutes the second-best adsorbent for TCE, whereas the commercially available BEA
adsorbs almost as much PCE as IFR. The volume concentration of 10 ppm in the CE/N2
mixture is on the same order of magnitude as typical long-term exposure limits, indicating that
these zeolites could find use for removal of traces of these contaminants, e.g., in a workplace
context or in the treatment of exhaust gases. At 1 kPa, the amounts adsorbed in the different
zeolites show a similar pattern for TCE and PCE. With few exceptions, the uptakes are well
correlated with the accessible pore volume Vacc, indicating a complete filling of the pores by
the guest molecules. This is corroborated by the adsorption isotherms visualized in the
supplementary EXCEL file, which show that saturation is essentially reached for all zeolites at
1 kPa, and, in many cases, at much lower pressures. For example, the PCE uptakes of
EUO/IFR at 1 kPa are only 4%/10% higher than the respective uptakes at 10−3 kPa.
The heats of TCE and PCE adsorption for the same eight zeolites are visualized in Figure 6.
For ease of comparison with other figures, qst is shown as a function of pressure, with pressure
on a logarithmic scale; a visualization as a function of loading would deliver qualitatively
analogous findings. Altogether, it is apparent that the affinity towards PCE is higher than
towards TCE, and that the isosteric heats of adsorption increase with increasing loading. While
the former observation is straightforwardly explained with the increased vdW interactions
between PCE and the zeolites, the latter finding points to a prominent role of attractive guestguest interactions. However, it is also noteworthy that both the quantitative differences among
the qst values obtained for TCE and PCE as well as the magnitude of the qst increase with
pressure vary considerably, depending on the framework type.

Figure 6: Isosteric heats of TCE and PCE adsorption

When taking a closer look at Figure 6, the following aspects are noteworthy:


TON and EUO exhibit the highest affinities towards both species at the lowest
pressure, but the increases in qst upon increasing pressure remain modest, on the
order of 5 kJ mol−1. qst(PCE) is about 10 kJ mol−1 higher than qst(TCE) across the range
of pressures.



For MTW, the affinity towards both species at low pressures is also relatively high.
While the increase of qst(TCE) with pressure is modest (as for TON and EUO), qst(PCE)
increases more markedly, reaching almost 85 kJ mol−1 at 1 kPa.



IFR shows a pronounced increase of the heats of adsorption with increasing pressure.
Whereas the qst values at 10−5 kPa are about 10 kJ mol−1 lower than those of TON,
they increase by 15/17 kJ mol−1 for TCE/PCE, respectively. Together with MTW, IFR
reaches the highest affinity towards PCE at 1 kPa.



For MOR, a marked increase of qst(TCE) with pressure is observed, whereas the heat
of PCE adsorption is much less affected. The difference between the two values at
1 kPa is unusually small, amounting to less than 3 kJ mol−1.



For MFI, intermediate values of qst are obtained for both species, and the increase with
pressure is also moderate.



For the remaining two systems, BEA and FAU, the heats of adsorption are rather low
at low pressures, but increase significantly with increasing pressure. A qualitatively
similar evolution has been observed experimentally for TCE in siliceous zeolite Y,39
although the overall increase was not quite as pronounced as predicted by the
simulations reported here. In FAU, the large cages put few constraints on the position
and orientation of the adsorbed molecules, allowing for local arrangements that
maximize attractive guest-guest interactions.

Simulation snapshots
Altogether, it is apparent that the framework topology not only affects the heat of adsorption in
the limit of low coverage, but also the extent of guest-guest interactions, including – in some
cases – intricate differences between TCE and PCE. In order to develop a more detailed
understanding of the adsorption behavior in zeolites of particular interest, fixed-loading MC
simulations were performed for one or two selected loadings, depending on the system, and
representative simulation snapshots were visualized. Figures 7 and 8 show such snapshots
for TON and EUO for two PCE loadings that correspond approximately to the uptakes at 10−5
kPa (TON: 2 PCE per simulation cell [s.c.], EUO: 16 PCE/s.c.) and at saturation, which is
almost reached at 10−3 kPa (TON/EUO: 24/64 PCE/s.c.). The snapshots obtained for lower
loadings show that PCE fits very nicely into the zigzag channels of TON and into the side
pockets of the EUO channels, with the local environments allowing short contacts of all 4 Cl
atoms to framework atoms. This tight fit explains the strong host-guest interactions that are
responsible for the high qst(PCE) at low pressures. Under near-saturation conditions, the
channels of TON are gradually filled, whereas additional molecules in EUO are adsorbed in
the main channels. In both zeolites, the adsorbed molecules lie more or less in the same plane,
with Cl atoms of adjacent molecules pointing towards each other. While the guest-guest
interactions felt by an individual molecule will depend on the specific local arrangement, it can
be inferred that attractive vdW interactions are at least partially counterbalanced by repulsive
electrostatic interactions between negatively polarized Cl atoms, especially at high guest
loadings. Therefore, the overall contribution of guest-guest interactions is only slightly
attractive, resulting in a modest increase of qst(PCE) with pressure.

For MTW, the simulation snapshot obtained for near-saturation conditions (20 PCE/s.c.),
visualized in the left panel of Figure 9, shows that the PCE molecules fit very well into the
pores of this system. Similar to the observations made for TON, the Cl atoms point into “bulges”
of the undulating channels, resulting in strong host-guest interactions. Unlike in TON, however,
the adsorbed PCE molecules do not lie in the same plane, but assume a preferred orientation
that is somewhat tilted with respect to the running direction of the channels. This tilted
arrangement allows for stronger attractive guest-guest interactions, for example, through
electrostatic interactions between Cl atoms and positively polarized C atoms of adjacent PCE
molecules. In IFR, visualized in the right panel of Figure 9, yet another scenario is observed:
Since the channels of this zeolite are somewhat wider, the PCE molecules are displaced from
the center of the zigzag channels, mostly interacting with one side of the pore wall. This lessthan-optimal fit explains why the heat of adsorption in IFR at low coverages is much lower than
in the zeolites discussed so far. The strong guest-guest interactions that are responsible for
the large increase of qst(PCE) with loading can also be understood on the basis of the
snapshot: Across some parts of the channels that are visible in the figure, the PCE molecules
form “chains” in which two chlorine atoms of one molecule point towards the central, positively
polarized area of one neighboring molecule. Moreover, the intramolecular Cl···C distances are
often close to the sum of the vdW radii.

Figure 9: Representative snapshots from fixed-loading simulations of PCE in MTW and IFR.

Finally, it is worth taking a look at MOR, where rather different trends in affinity were observed
for PCE and TCE. A snapshot computed for high TCE loadings, visualized in the left panel of
Figure 10, shows that the majority of the adsorbed molecules are oriented essentially
perpendicular to the running direction of the channels. Across large portions of the channel,
the stacking of the TCE molecules is largely commensurate with the slight undulation of the
20

MOR channels. In contrast, adsorbed PCE molecules are never found in such a perpendicular
orientation, but they always lie more or less in the plane of the elliptical 12MR channels (right
panel of Figure 10). Apparently, PCE, although being only slightly larger than TCE, is too bulky
to assume an orientation perpendicular to the channel axis, resulting in a less efficient packing
of the adsorbed molecules. For this reason, the attainable PCE loading is significantly smaller
(0.9 mmol g−1, compared to 1.2 mmol g−1 for TCE), and the contribution of attractive guestguest interactions is also reduced considerably.

Conclusions
Molecular simulations were carried out to study the adsorption of CEs and ETH in a structurally
diverse set of all-silica zeolites, with the discussion of the results focusing on VC and, most
prominently, TCE and PCE. The Henry constant simulations performed in the first part of the
study showed wide variations in affinity, highlighting the important influence of pore topology
on the interaction with CEs. Due to the limited computational expense, such simulations could
straightforwardly be extended to include other zeolite frameworks and/or other (emerging)
environmental contaminants, such as fluorinated hydrocarbons, 1,3-butadiene, acrylonitrile,
ethylene oxide, or others. Naturally, a key prerequisite for such extensions is the availability of
sufficiently accurate force field parameters, whose suitability should be ascertained through a
validation against experimental data whenever possible.
The following GCMC simulations, which covered a wide range of pressures, showed that VC
uptakes at ppm concentrations are too low to be practically relevant for VC removal. In
contrast, several zeolites showed substantial uptakes of TCE and PCE in the range of 0.1 to
21

10 ppm, indicating that they might be suitable adsorbents for the removal of trace amounts of
these species. Among the frameworks studied, the 12MR zeolites EUO, IFR, and MTW would
be of most interest for future experimental studies; however, these zeolites are, to the author’s
knowledge, not commercially available. Focusing on those zeolites that are actually marketed
in high-silica form, BEA (available as zeolite beta, which shows stacking disorder of the beta
layers31) and MOR (mordenite) appear as most promising choices. This finding is particularly
relevant when considering that most previous experimental studies of CE adsorption have
concentrated on MFI- and FAU-type zeolites. As shown for selected cases, a detailed analysis
of simulation snapshots can provide insights into the role of host-guest and guest-guest
interactions. Such insights can help to develop descriptors that may facilitate the identification
of other zeolites (or related crystalline microporous materials) that should be of particular
interest as adsorbents for CE removal. These could then be prioritized in future work.
It should be noted that GCMC simulations including the co-adsorption of N2 indicate that its
presence does not have a major impact on CE uptake. Real-world scenarios, however, would
typically involve the adsorption of CEs from complex gas mixtures, where competitive
adsorption of other species is likely to affect the attainable CE adsorption capacities. Such
issues, which will depend on the specific composition of the gas feed in a given setting, should
be addressed in future experimental and computational studies. One aspect that is of particular
importance is the co-adsorption of water, which is ubiquitous and often strongly adsorbed due
to its large dipole moment. While perfect all-silica zeolites are hydrophobic, the presence of
defects tends to increase the hydrophilicity, thus promoting the competitive adsorption of
water. Inclusion of such defects and of co-adsorbed water molecules would constitute an
interesting task for future molecular simulation studies. Additional challenges arise when
considering the adsorption from aqueous solution, rather than from the gas phase, in molecular
simulations. In a recent study focusing on 1,4-dioxane adsorption in zeolites, a gauge cell MC
approach was employed to model the adsorption from aqueous solution in the parts per billion
(ppb) range.81 It could be very interesting to exploit this approach in simulations of CE
adsorption from water.
In terms of diffusion properties, only a qualitative, preliminary assessment was made in the
context of the present study. According to this assessment, diffusion limitations should not play
a major role, especially in zeolites with 12MR pore openings. However, numerical modelling
of the diffusion properties could be of interest when targeting the application of zeolite
membranes for CE removal, where the permeation selectivity of the membrane can be
expressed as a product of the adsorption and diffusion selectivities.82
Another aspect that has not been in the focus here is the regeneration of the zeolite adsorbent.
In the view of the high thermal stability of high-silica zeolites, which typically exceeds 1000 °C,
22

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-w6kxl-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5133-1537 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

thermal regeneration appears as a straightforward option. Beyond that, doping with
catalytically active metals could constitute a pathway towards CE decomposition that requires
less thermal energy. In such systems, the interplay of adsorption properties (guaranteeing
efficient CE capture) and catalytic properties (affording complete CE decomposition) should
be optimized in order to maximize the CE removal efficiency.
