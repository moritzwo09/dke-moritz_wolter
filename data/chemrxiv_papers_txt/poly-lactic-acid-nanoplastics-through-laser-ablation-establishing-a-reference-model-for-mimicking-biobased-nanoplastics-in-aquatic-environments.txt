Abstract
Due to the well-documented negative environmental impacts of conventional plastics,
the use of bioplastics has been increasing. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is currently among the
most common and industrially available bioplastics. Although PLA is compostable under
industrial conditions and generally degrades more quickly than conventional plastics, its
breakdown in typical environmental settings remains problematic. PLA’s potential to
contribute to plastic pollution through the release of microplastics and nanoplastics makes
it crucial to understand how these particles behave, especially in marine environments.
However, as for all nanoplastics, identifying, isolating, and quantifying PLA nanoplastics
in water presents significant challenges. This study proposes a versatile approach to
fabricate PLA nanoplastics through laser ablation in a water environment to mimic realworld samples. Commencing with bulk PLA films, this top-down method yields the
formation of nanoplastics with an average diameter of 54.7 ± 26.7 nm. Surface and
chemical analyses confirm the presence of carboxylic groups on their surface, potentially
resembling the environmental degradation pathway of PLA under exposure to sunlight
and humid environments. This indicates that the proposed process results in a PLA
nanoplastics system that serves as an invaluable reference model, enabling realistic
environmental scenario explorations and simulations for risk assessment evaluations on
bio-based nanoplastics.

Introduction
Since the advent of the first synthetic polymer, plastics have proliferated exponentially,
driven by mass production and rapid expansion. Among the most prevalent are
thermoplastic polymers, like polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE),
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), and polystyrene (PS),
all derived from non-renewable petrochemical sources 1. These polymers, engineered to
be low-cost and highly adaptable, exhibit resilience against various environmental factors
such as microbial degradation, light exposure, and water permeation. This durability
makes them indispensable for everyday applications, such as packaging and biomedical.
However, their longevity poses a significant environmental threat when they are exposed
to the environment in the form of plastic litter 2-4.
In fact, according to the Global Plastics Outlook database published in 2022 by the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only 9% of the
produced plastic waste undergoes recycling, while 19% is incinerated. 5 The remaining
amount is either deposited in landfills (50%) or not managed with any of the processes
mentioned above (22%), ultimately finding its way into aquatic ecosystems, where it
accumulates over time

6.

Specifically, long-term projections suggest an alarming

escalation in mismanaged plastic waste, reaching over 270 million metric tons by 2060 5.
Such projections underscore the urgent need to address the pervasive issue of plastic
waste accumulation and the resulting profound ecological ramifications.

These concerns surrounding the widespread use of petroleum-based plastics and their
enduring presence in the environment have prompted efforts to explore alternative and
more environmentally friendly materials, such as biobased and biodegradable plastics.
One such alternative gaining traction is poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a thermoplastic polymer
lauded for its bio-based origin and biodegradability under controlled conditions. PLA
presents a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of petroleum-based
plastics, offering similar versatility, processability, and functionality as conventional
counterparts for specific applications 7. In fact, due to all these properties, PLA has earned
the title of the "polymer of the 21st century" 8, 9. However, studies reveal that the
biodegradability of PLA is limited to specific composting conditions, requiring an oxygenrich environment under controlled temperatures (58-80 °C) and humidity (> 60%) 10. This
raises concerns about its eventual persistence in natural environments, resembling its
petroleum-based counterparts, particularly in marine settings where temperatures are
lower 2. PLA waste in the environment may undergo various degradation pathways such
as photo and thermal-oxidation, hydrolysis, mechanical fragmentation, etc. 2, 11, 12 to form
microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). NPs are plastic fragments of size <1000 nm
13,

with altered chemical and structural properties compared to their bulk, and are

considered contaminants of emerging concern 13, 14. As PLA utilization increases, it is
important to expand our knowledge of the formation pathways of PLA NPs, their presence
in the environment, and their environmental fate.
Multiple very recent studies have been conducted to explore the possible release of
PLA MPs and NPs from commercial products such as PLA-lined paper cups 15 and tea
bags 16, as well as the formation of secondary fragments under UV photoaging,

mechanical, biological, and enzymatic degradation of PLA macroplastic components 1719. Despite confirming the release of PLA NPs under environmental stressors in well-

controlled experimental conditions, studies on the presence of PLA NPs in environmental
samples present a multifaceted research challenge. This stems from the diversity of the
properties of plastic sources, usage patterns, and different waste management strategies
linked to the disposal of plastics. Consequently, there are numerous emission pathways
for MPs and NPs. Therefore, the properties of the generated particles may also reflect
these diversities 20-23, which, in combination with the various interactions that NPs may
have with various environmental components, result in NPs with a wide range of physical
and chemical properties in actual field samples. On top of that, studies have shown that
the environmental concentrations of NPs are extremely low, ranging between 0.04-1.17
mg/L (depending on the NPs and water type) 24. Considering also the fact that the
environmental samples usually contain a great variety of organic matter makes the NPs
identification and quantification akin to searching for a needle in a haystack 25.
Recently, studies have begun to shed light on the effects of PLA MPs and NPs on
organisms, using either commercially available particles 26, 27 or PLA NPs prepared
through bottom-up chemical methods such as solvent evaporation combined with miniemulsion techniques 28, 29. Nevertheless, these studies may not fully capture the
characteristics of environmentally relevant NPs, which often exhibit irregular shapes and
complex surface chemistry. Despite the extensive endeavors to create representative
reference NPs models using top-down techniques like milling processes 30, 31 and laser
ablation 32, 33, based on current knowledge, these are mainly focused on conventional
plastics. In fact, there appears to be a gap in such efforts concerning commonly used

PLA, highlighting the necessity to broaden research endeavors toward constructing more
representative reference models for studying the fate of PLA NPs. Understanding their
distinctive properties and environmental behavior holds profound benefits for ecosystem
health and human well-being in the foreseeable future.
This study presents a versatile chemical-free approach to fabricating PLA NPs that
closely mimic their expected properties in natural environmental conditions. Through laser
ablation of a bulk PLA film immersed in water using an excimer pulsed laser with an
excitation wavelength of 248 nm, PLA NPs with an average diameter of 54.7 ± 26.7 nm
were successfully synthesized directly in the water medium. Chemical characterization of
the resulting NPs reveals potential surface modifications consistent with the
environmental degradation pathways of PLA. The as-fabricated PLA NPs serve as
invaluable reference samples for studying the environmental fate of such particles and
enable more realistic environmental assessments. Therefore, the presented outcomes
contribute to advancing our understanding of PLA NPs and underscore the importance of
considering bio-based polymeric fragments in environmental research.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Extruder grade PLA pellets (Grade: 2003D, Cas-No: 9051-89-2) were supplied from
NatureWorks. UranyLess EM (electron microscopy grade) contrast stain solution used for
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies was purchased from Delta Microscopies.
Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride salt (Trizma hydrochloride, Cas-No:

P3813, pH 7.4, 0.002 M), acetic acid (Cas-No: 64-19-7, purity ≥99.8%), sodium hydroxide
(Cas-No: 1310-73-2, purity ≥98%), isopropanol (Cas-no: 67-63-0, purity ≥99.5%), as well
as chloroform (CDCl3, Cas-no: 865-49-6, 99.9 atom % D) and deuterium oxide (D2O, Casno: 7789-20-0, 99.9 atom % D) used for NMR analyses, were all purchased from SigmaAldrich.

Fabrication of PLA Films
To prevent interaction with air and moisture, the PLA pellets were initially dried in a
vacuum oven at 60°C for 24 hours. Subsequently, the pellets were processed using an
IKA Pilotina MC dry miller equipped with a sieve with a pore size of 3 mm. The resultant
PLA powder, with a particle size of ≤ 3 mm, underwent an additional vacuum drying step
under identical conditions, as previously referred, to ensure optimal dryness before film
preparation. PLA films were then fabricated following a compression molding process
using a Carver 4122 hot press. Precisely, 12 mg of the ground PLA powder were placed
between two metal frames lined with Teflon sheets to prevent adhesion during the
pressing process. This assembly was subsequently introduced between hot plates
preheated to 180 °C. Initially, the polymer was allowed to melt for 5 minutes without any
applied pressure. Following this, a pressure of 4 metric tons was applied for 10 minutes
to ensure proper molding and cohesion of the PLA. Once the pressing cycle was
completed, the plates were left to naturally cool down to room temperature, forming the
desired flat PLA films with a thickness of 1 mm and an area of 100 cm 2.

Fabrication of PLA NPs by laser ablation
Before laser treatment, the produced PLA films were meticulously cleaned using
isopropanol, followed by Milli-Q water washing steps. The laser ablation was executed by
exposing a 6 cm2 segment of the PLA film immersed in 8 mL of Milli-Q water to pulsed
UV laser irradiation (Supplementary data Figure S1) using a KrF excimer laser (irradiation
wavelength 248 nm, pulse duration of 20 ns, repetition rate of 10 Hz, CoherentCompexPro 110) coupled with a micromachining apparatus (Optec-MicroMaster). The
laser ablation was performed by 50 pulses, at a fluence of 3.5 J/cm2, to produce an
ablation spot of 450 × 450 µm. One complete ablation cycle consists of 144 ablation spots,
arranged in a 12 × 12 grid format (Supplementary data Figure S2). To obtain an ablation
product with a high number of NPs, 32 ablation cycles were executed, and the resultant
dispersion was concentrated using a rotavapor set at 45 °C. For the chemical
characterizations of the NPs, the concentrated samples underwent centrifugation
(utilizing a Sartorius, Centristat G-16C centrifuge) at 21,000 x g for a duration of 10
minutes at 23 °C. After removal of the supernatant, the precipitated material was
resuspended in approximately 20 µL of Milli-Q water and subsequently used for further
characterization.

NPs Characterization
The morphology of the NPs was examined using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Jeol JEM 1400 Plus) imaging. Before the analysis, the concentrated samples
were sonicated for 1 minute to ensure the uniform dispersion of particles. After sonication,

samples were stained with UranyLess EM contrast stain solution for 30 seconds and were
deposited onto a copper (Cu) grid pre-coated with an ultra-thin layer of amorphous carbon
film, ensuring optimal contrast and visualization during TEM analysis. Multiple images
were captured and analyzed using the ImageJ and OriginPro 2020 software to obtain the
size distribution of the observed NPs.
The hydrodynamic size distribution and the concentration of the formed NPs were
quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with the Malvern NanoSight Pro 300
(Malvern Panalytical), equipped with the NTA software version 3.4. Samples from different
ablation cycles were analyzed to compare the repeatability across the ablation cycles.
For this analysis, a volume of 1 mL from the vortexed sample was introduced into the NTA
system via a syringe pump, operating at a rate of 50 AU. The particles were detected by
blue laser (λ= 488 nm) camera-type sCMOS, providing the requisite sensitivity and
resolution for accurate particle tracking and quantification.
Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) was used to assess the surface charge
characteristics of the produced NPs across varying pH values. To obtain the necessary
pH values, aliquots of 300 µL of the ablation product were mixed with 700 µL of the
different buffers prepared from tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride salt
(Trizma hydrochloride) in Milli-Q water (pH 9–8, 0.002 M), phosphate buffer saline in MilliQ water (pH 7–6, 0.002 M), and diluted acetic acid (0.002 M) in Milli-Q water with sodium
hydroxide (pH 5–3, 0.002 M).
The NPs, concentrated through rotavapor and centrifugation, were resuspended in
Milli-Q water and carefully drop-casted onto pre-cleaned and dried silicon wafer for
Raman spectroscopy analysis (Supplementary data Figure S3). For a comparative

analysis, a pristine PLA film, cleaned with isopropanol and Milli-Q, was also examined.
The Raman spectra were acquired utilizing the Renishaw inVia confocal Raman
microscope, equipped with a CW DPSS laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The spectral
data were captured over the 600-3100 cm-1 range under the confocal settings using the
150x objective, with an accumulation time of 120 seconds at a laser power density of 50
kW/cm2. After data acquisition, data analysis and processing were executed using the
built-in Wire 5.5 software platform.
The surface composition of NPs was elucidated through X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD instrument. The concentrated NPs
were drop-casted on a precleaned and dried indium (In) substrate. A comparative analysis
was also performed on the PLA film, which was cleaned with isopropanol and followed
with Milli-Q water. A monochromatic Al Kα source acquired both survey and highresolution spectra, operating at 20 mA and 15 kV. The survey spectra were obtained with
a pass energy set at 160 eV, an energy step of 1 eV, and an analyzed area spanning
300×700 μm2. Concurrently, high-resolution spectra were recorded within the same
designated area, utilizing a pass energy of 20 eV and an incremental energy step of 0.1
eV. The Kratos charge neutralizer system was consistently applied across all samples to
ensure accurate data interpretation. Furthermore, for precise binding energy scale
calibration, the position of the dominant C 1s peak was standardized at 285 eV,
representative of C-C bond configurations. Subsequent data analysis and interpretation
were conducted utilizing the Casa XPS software.
The NMR analysis was also performed on the ablation product to identify the molecular
components and to confirm the chemical nature of the formed NPs. To allow the

characterization of the solid fraction and considering that polymer chains form this, the
concentrated NPs (prepared following the same protocol explained previously) were
resuspended in CDCl3 and D2O in a 1:1 ratio. The obtained dispersion was subsequently
centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3200 rpm to separate the D2O part from the CDCl3 and
separately collect the two phases. The CDCl3 can dissolve PLA and is expected to contain
all the molecular polymeric components in its phase. In contrast, the D 2O phase may
contain the polar molecular components of the ablation product distributed in the water
medium during the ablation process. For the comparative studies, 5 mg of pristine PLA
was dissolved in 500 µL of CDCl3 and was vortexed for 30 minutes. The 1H NMR spectra
of the PLA film and the ablation product in CDCl3 were recorded using Bruker FT NMR
Neo 600 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm CryoprobeTM QCI 1H/19F 13C/15N-D
and an automatic sample changer, SampleJet™, with temperature control. The spectra
were collected with the Bruker zg30 sequence, with a 30-degree flip angle, TD 64 K, a
spectral width of 30 ppm, an acquisition time of 1.835 seconds, a number of 2048 scans,
and a relaxation delay of 4 seconds.

Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1 (a), the TEM analysis of the concentrated ablation product
reveals the presence of spherical-like particles and some particles of irregular shape. The
particle size distribution presented in Figure 1 (b) shows that particles have a nanoscale
size ranging between 10-125 nm, with an average diameter of 54.7 ± 26.7 nm. TEM

images were captured from different spots across the sample (Supplementary data Figure
S4) to ensure an objective size analysis.

Figure 1. (a) TEM micrograph of the formed nanoparticles. (b) The size distribution of
nanoparticles was calculated from TEM micrographs using ImageJ software on a total of
180 particles.

To further explore the size distribution and quantify the number of particles in the
ablation product, the NTA analysis was employed. As revealed by the study, each ablation
cycle yielded around 1.29 × 109 ± 6.46 × 107 particles/mL. Furthermore, as depicted in
Figure 2, in agreement with the TEM study, the produced nanoparticles have
heterogeneous size distribution, with most of them presenting hydrodynamic sizes
ranging between 50-200 nm, with a mean size of around 127.4 ± 42.9 nm in the aqueous
medium. Furthermore, a substantial proportion, encompassing about 90% of the particles,
has diameters not exceeding 185 nm. In contrast, a minor fraction, constituting 10% of
the particles detected, exhibited a hydrodynamic diameter of less than 75 nm. To explore
if the adopted method results in a reproducible fabrication process, the NTA analysis was

performed on samples from different ablation cycles. As shown in Table S1 of the
Supplementary data file, the concentration and size distributions were comparable across
NPs produced from different ablation cycles, confirming the repeatability of the fabrication
process.

formation of these particles, starting from the polymer film immersed in water, may be
attributed to one of the two main ablation pathways: condensation or fragmentation.
Condensation is a purely thermal pathway that follows the atomization of polymeric matter
upon photon absorption. The carbon vapor formed during the heating phase condenses
upon saturation in the plume, primarily forming carbon-based nanoparticles. 34. On the
other hand, fragmentation is a mechanical effect attributed to the hydrodynamical
expansion of the heated volume of the polymer target. It breaks the polymeric material
into small particles due to the rapid thermoelastic expansion and tensile. Therefore, it may
be a low-temperature pathway preserving the chemical structure of the polymer, mainly
resulting in the formation of polymer-like nanoparticles. 34. It is essential to note that the
properties of the resulting particles are intricately linked to the inherent characteristics of
the polymer and the specific operational parameters of the laser system employed. 35, 36.
It should also be emphasized that there is no ionization and decomposition of water, as it
is less likely to happen in a nanosecond (ns) laser processing underwater 37.
To evaluate the chemical nature of the formed particles, Raman analysis was
performed on the ablation product, and the obtained spectrum was compared with that of
the pristine PLA film. As shown in Figure 3, the Raman spectrum of pristine PLA depicts
all the characteristic peaks of the PLA 38, with the prominent peaks at 873 and 1768 cm-1
to indicate the out-of-phase C-O-C and carbonyl stretching of the polymer chain,
respectively. The two peaks at 1044 and 1129 cm-1 denote the C–CH3 bond stretch 38,
while the vibrational signatures associated with the symmetric and asymmetric
deformation modes of CH3 groups are visible at 1392 cm-1 and 1455 cm-1, respectively.
Furthermore, the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of CH 3 groups were

14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7glks ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-9713 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

observed at 2944 cm-1 and 3002 cm-1, respectively 39. Finally, the symmetric stretching
mode of the C-H bonds is evident at 2866 cm-1. A comprehensive analysis of the ablation
product spectrum underscores that the generated particles retain all the distinctive peaks
representative of the PLA polymer, proving that the formed particles have the PLA
polymeric nature, suggesting the formation of NPs through the fragmentation ablation
pathway. Interestingly, additional peaks also appear, postulated to arise from the
degradation effects induced by the laser ablation of the film in water, targeting the ester
bonds within the PLA matrix, confirming the formation of different chemical groups not
initially part of the PLA polymer 40. Specifically, a closer look at the Raman spectrum
shows additional peaks between the 1620-1680 cm-1 range, which can be attributed to
C=C and the out-of-the-phase stretching of carboxylic groups 41. The appearance of the
double-bonded carbon peak indicates the presence of alkanes or cyclic compounds 42.

analysis.
The presented results so far effectively confirm the formation of PLA NPs upon laser
ablation of PLA films. Nonetheless, NPs originating from different environmental
degradation pathways are proven to comprise diverse surface chemistry 14, 43. To explore
the surface properties of the formed PLA NPs and any resemblance with those anticipated
during the aging of environmentally exposed samples, the surface charge and the XPS
analyses of the NPs were performed. The zeta potential of the as-generated PLA NPs
was -37.6 ± 4.6 mV in the water dispersion after the laser ablation process, with the pH
ranging between 6.5-7, in agreement with what was observed by Banaei et al. 16 in PLA

NPs (∼ 280 nm) released from commercial tea bags, and Zhang et al. 44 on photo-aged
PLA NPs. Through the pH modification of the NPs medium, it can be observed that the
zeta potential increases in absolute values as the pH increases. These changes are more
evident in the 5-8 pH range. This behavior is characteristic of the presence of weak acidic
groups on the NPs surface, possibly arising from the surface oxidation of the PLA and
cleavage of polymeric chains induced upon exposure to UV-pulsed laser irradiation during
ablation 45. Such processes can form weak acidic groups on the NPs surface, imparting
a negative surface charge at the NP-water interface 46. As shown in Figure 5, by
increasing the pH of the solution, the deprotonation of the weak acidic groups leads to
the formation of a more negative surface charge. On the contrary, these groups undergo
protonation under acidic conditions, shifting the surface charge towards more positive
values.

The surface chemistry of the produced PLA NPs was also explored by XPS. As shown
in Figure 5 (a), the deconvolution of the C1s of the pristine PLA film indicates the
contribution of three characteristic peaks at 285.0, 287.0, and 289.0 eV attributed to the
C-C or to the C-H bonds, to the C-O-C=O, and to the O=C-O bonds respectively 47 (also
refer supplementary data S2). In the case of the PLA NPs, as in Figure 5 (b), in addition
to the characteristic peaks of PLA, two additional peaks at 285.7 and 287.2 eV appear,
corresponding to the hydroxyl (-COH) and carboxyl (-COOH) polar functional groups,
confirming the observations of the zeta potential analysis. Analogous changes were
observed in PLA films treated with ns (248 nm) and fs (515 nm) laser pulses, 48, 49, with
UV lamps 50, and environmental factors (light, humidity, and temperature) 51, indicating

that these changes can be attributed to the aging of PLA under the influence of laser
irradiation in the presence of water.
On the other hand, the O1s spectra of pristine PLA film and PLA NPs presented in
Figure 5(c),(d) possess two characteristic peaks at 532.2 and 533.2 eV corresponding to
the ester (O=C-O-C) and ether (C-O-C) in the main polymer chain (please refer also to
Table S2, Supplementary data). 47 In the deconvolution of the O1s, the atomic
percentages (Supplementary data Table S3) of C-O decrease while C=O increases in the
PLA NPs compared to the pristine PLA. These changes and the presence of additional
surface groups indicate the modifications in PLA due to the adopted laser ablation

spectra of PLA NPs. Additional oxygen bonds are attributed to the substrate (InOx) and
possible impurities during the sample preparation process (see also Supplementary data
Figure S5).
To further investigate the chemical nature of the formed particles in the water, NMR
analysis was also performed. According to Figure S6 in the supplementary data, the NMR
spectrum of the pristine PLA film dissolved in CDCl3 is in accordance with what was
reported in the literature 52, 53. Some additional signals observed can be attributed to the
different forms of the PLA, such as poly(L-PLA), poly(rac-PLA), isotactic PLA, or

syndiotactic PLA 46, 52. Similarly, as shown in Figure 6(a), the NMR spectrum of the
ablation product in CDCl3 resembles the spectrum of the pristine PLA film, confirming, as
in the case of the Raman study, that the formed NPs are of PLA nature 53. Additional
peaks attributed to the D2O residue and the CDCl3 solvent are also present in the
spectrum of PLA NPs. Furthermore, a peak attributed to formic acid is also evident, in
agreement with Theriasis et al., who also detected formic acid in minor proportions after
the photo-oxidation of PLA along with other low molecular weight photo products 54, as
well as with what was observed by Magri et al. 32 in PET NPs fabricated by laser ablation.
In the aliphatic region of the spectrum (Figure 6(b)), other than the expected signals
corresponding to PLA, many additional signals appear, which could be attributed to the
possible presence of different chain lengths and forms of PLA. Interestingly, as depicted
in Figure 6(c), some unexpected signals relating to the aromatic molecules were observed
(Supplementary Figure S7), which could be attributed to the production of aromatic
molecules due to the possible thermal degradation of PLA [44], as reported previously. In
particular, Lomakin et al., evaluating the photodegradation of PLA under UV radiation,
observed weak signals corresponding to the double bond of the C=C-C(O)O- group 55,
which were absent in the pristine PLA. However, in the present case, the concentration
of these substances is too low to allow their identification through 2D NMR experiments
and/or 13C NMR analysis. To sum up, the NMR analysis of the ablation product confirms
that the NPs formed by laser ablation are indeed PLA-based NPs, preserving the main
structural fragments of PLA along with different polymeric units of varying chain lengths
and molecular structures due to the possible degradation process during their formation.

The NMR analysis of the D2O fraction (supplementary Figure S8) showed the presence
of lactic acid; the different NMR signals could be due to the presence of various forms of
lactic acid, like monomer, dimer, and trimer. Also, we observed different solvent residual
impurities in this spectrum, like ethanol, methanol, acetone, and acetic acid, at different
concentrations, probably due to the sample handling while using rotavapor. Only the NMR
signals of formic acid and CDCl3 are visible in the aromatic region.

The so-far performed analysis of the formed NPs reveals their PLA chemical nature and
a significant surface chemistry modification. The low concentration of the potential byproducts hindered the ability to conduct supporting analyses necessary for defining a
specific degradation mechanism during the adopted fabrication process. It should be
noted that further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the byproducts to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the extent and precise mechanisms underlying these
degradation pathways of PLA NPs formed through laser ablation.
However, it is essential to note that the typical environmental degradation pathways of
PLA have been well-established in the literature 2, 10, 42. Excluding biodegradation,
according to Figure 7, the degradation of PLA involves hydrolysis (pathway A), photooxidation (pathway B), thermo-oxidation (pathway C), or a combination of these
processes. 2.
According to pathway (A), the hydrolytic degradation of PLA under the influence of
water and heat occurs via chain cleavage of ester groups, preferentially in the amorphous
regions, 56 leading to an increase in the concentration of carboxylic acid end chains.
These carboxylic end groups and their oligomers can catalyze the breakage of ester
linkage during hydrolysis, forming acid groups. In the present study, the detection of
additional polar groups (-COOH and -COH) on the surface of the NPs, along with their
negative charge, could be indicative of the formation of carboxylic end-group compounds
due to the hydrolytic degradation of the PLA during ablation.
In addition, considering pathway (B), the photo-oxidative degradation of PLA happens
via the dissociation of C-O and C=O bonds in the presence of UV radiation below 280
nm. 57 The photodegradation of PLA mainly follows the Norrish type II mechanism, in

23

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-7glks ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-9713 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

which an excited state carbonyl abstracts an α-H to yield carboxylic acid and vinyl chain
ends groups. The main chain scission in PLA can also lead to the formation of C=C bonds,
where the electron transition at C=O triggers the reaction 58. Lomakin et al. have also
reported a similar formation of C=C bonds with the participation of CH 3 groups associated
with the photodissociation of PLA following the Norrish II mechanism 55. However, the
weak signals corresponding to these peaks in the analyses could indicate the weakly
expressed nature of this mechanism. In addition to Norrish type II products,
hyperperoxide intermediates can also be formed from the activation of the methine group
of the PLA backbone and the insertion of O2, which can subsequently degrade to
carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and diketones 59. The presence of carboxylic acid groups on
the NP surface observed in Raman and XPS analyses, along with the C=C bonds in the
Raman spectrum and the NMR analysis, could indicate the photodegradation pathway of
PLA upon interaction with a UV laser.
Finally, PLA can also undergo thermal degradation during laser ablation, predominantly
by random chain scissions through non-radical reactions along the polymer backbone, as
shown in the pathway (C). Depending on the point in the backbone at which the reaction
occurs, the final product could be a lactide molecule, an oligomeric ring with more than
two repeat units, or acetaldehyde plus carbon monoxide 42, 60-62. In addition, the presence
of oxygen can also induce thermo-oxidative degradation, inducing chain scission
mechanisms, the formation of free radicals, and ester and carbonyl groups. 10. PLA is also
reported to form a series of oxidation, fracture, and double bond products after photoaging
under low-temperature thermal degradation conditions, including molecular chain
fracture, depolymerization, and inter and intramolecular exchange reactions 63. As

observed in the NMR analysis of the NPs, the presence of very weak peaks at the
aromatic region may be, indeed, due to the formation of aromatic molecules (like Ophthalic acid) 42 as a result of thermo-oxidative degradation, as mentioned above. Overall,
from the presented analyses, it may be concluded that the degradation process is a
combined mechanism of all three pathways. This leads to the aging of the polymer,
causing deterioration of chemical properties 64 by the chain disruption at the ester group
and the formation of small-sized compounds and other molecules 8.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we present an attempt to mimic PLA NPs that would naturally form in
aqueous environments due to the environmental degradation of macroplastics. This was
succeeded through the fabrication of PLA NPs via laser ablation in a water environment,
yielding particles characterized by a nearly spherical geometry and heterogeneous size
distribution with an average diameter of 54.7 ± 26.7 nm. The NTA analysis also confirms
this heterogeneity of the NPs, with 90% of the particles detected falling below 200 nm of
hydrodynamic diameter. The analytical techniques adopted corroborated the chemical
nature of the developed NPs with some modifications attributed to the primary chain
polymer backbone cleavage, with physicochemical attributes corresponding to those of
their expected naturally occurring counterparts. Moving forward, the herein fabricated
NPs present a valuable model for investigating the environmental implications of a
biobased polymer like PLA, especially their interactions and potential complex formations
with other environmental pollutants.
