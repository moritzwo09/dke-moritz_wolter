ABSTRACT：

18

Hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) are conventionally screened by matching

19

experimental- to reference electron ionization (EI) mass spectra acquired using gas

20

chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, for identification of novel

21

substances that are absent from EI databases, de novo structure elucidation using EI is

22

hampered by extensive in-source fragmentation. To address this problem, a new method

23

based on GC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) coupled to ion mobility-

24

high resolution mass spectrometry (IM-HRMS) was developed for simultaneous target,

25

suspect, and non-target screening of HOCs. Of 102 target chemicals, 85.3% produced

26

(quasi-)molecular ions as base peaks, with 71.6% displaying method detection limits

27

lower than those of GC-EI-low resolution MS. The optimized method was applied to

28

standard reference sediment and sediments from the Baltic Sea, an Arctic shelf, and a

29

Norwegian lake. In total, we quantified 56 target chemicals with concentrations ranging

30

from 4.86 pg g-1 dwt to 124 ng g-1 dwt. Further, using a combination of exact mass,

31

collision cross section (CCS), retention time, and MS2 spectra, a total of 54 suspects

32

were identified at Confidence Level (CL) 2. Among the remaining features, 169 were

33

prioritized using a halogen-selective CCS cutoff (100 Å2 + 20% mass), leading to

34

annotation 54 substances (CL ≤3). Notably, a suite of fluorotelomer thiols, disulfides,

35

and alkyl sulfones were identified in sediment (CL 1-2) for the first time. Overall, this

36

work demonstrates the potential of GC-APCI-IM-HRMS as a next-generation

37

technique for resolving complex HOC mixtures in environmental samples through

38

exploitation of molecular ions.

INTRODUCTION

46

Chemical pollution is recognized as one of nine planetary boundaries which

47

threatens the stability of Earth systems.1 Between 700 and 1,700 new chemicals are

48

registered in the United States and European Union every year,2 and many more remain

49

undocumented until they are discovered in the environment. Therefore, the need to

50

comprehensively evaluate the occurrence and impact of chemicals challenges current

51

monitoring frameworks to move beyond characterization and risk assessments of single

52

chemicals, towards quantitative screening of as many known substances as possible,

53

while simultaneously collecting non-target data suitable for identifying unknown

54

compounds.3

55

Typically, hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) are analyzed using gas

56

chromatography-electron ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS). The reproducible

57

fragmentation obtained from EI at 70 eV enables annotation of known HOCs through

58

matching of experimental- to reference mass spectra.4 However, the frequent absence

59

of molecular ions in EI impedes de novo structural elucidation of unknown

60

compounds.5 While electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) offers a partial solution

61

to this problem, this techniques tends to be too selective for broad screening, since only

62

a small group of compounds with a resonance structure and high electron affinity can

63

generate molecular ions.6,7 Therefore, an ionization technique for GC that is both

64

universal and “soft” is critical for comprehensive screening of HOCs.

65

Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) can efficiently preserve

66

(quasi-)molecular ions of GC-amenable compounds through charge/proton transfer.8 Its

67

potential for harnessing molecular ions has been demonstrated in studies involving

68

wide-scope quantification of emerging contaminants and even identification of

69

unknown compounds.9-12 When coupled to ion mobility (IM), instrument-independent

70

and reproducible collision cross section (CCS) values can be acquired to provide

71

additional structure information, improving confidence in identification.13 A number of

72

pioneering studies have already begun developing HOC databases and non-target

73

prioritization strategies based on CCS,14,15 highlighting the great potential of this

74

technique for both screening and discovery of environmental contaminants.

75

As a sink for organic carbon (OC), sediment is a complex matrix containing a

76

diverse range of HOCs, making it ideally suited for testing the performance of new

77

analytical methods. In this study, we developed and validated a new analytical

78

workflow for simultaneous target, suspect, and non-target screening of HOCs in

79

sediment

80

(quasi-)molecular ions. Testing the new method on a diverse range of sediment samples

81

demonstrated its widespread applicability and generated new quantitative and

82

qualitative information on legacy, emerging, and even unknown substances in both

remote and impacted sediment samples.

for analysis. Sample volumes of 1 μL were injected in pulse splitless mode with a

90

programmed inlet temperature for vaporization: initially 100 °C for 0.15 min, then

91

increased at 600 °C min-1 to 280 °C, and then held for 1 min. Analytes were separated

92

using a 30-m DB-5MS Ultra Inert column (i.d., 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 µm;

93

Agilent Technologies) with helium carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.5 mL min-1. The

94

GC oven temperature program was as follows: held at 70 °C for 1 min, increased at

95

10 °C min-1 to 310 °C, and then held for 15 min.

96

The GC-MS interface and ion source were maintained at 290 and 150 °C,

97

respectively. The corona discharge and cone voltage were set at 2 μA and 30 V,

98

separately. N2 was used as the makeup gas, auxiliary gas, and cone gas at flow rates of

99

200 mL min-1, 350 L h-1, and 250 L h-1, respectively, in the dry condition. An uncapped

100

bottle of water was placed in the ionization enclosure to achieve wet conditions.

101

Auxiliary and cone gas flow rates were reduced to 150 and 200 L h-1, respectively, under

102

wet conditions. The ion source was conditioned overnight before use.

103

The MS was operated in high-definition MSE mode with a mass range of 100-1200

104

Da. Collision energy was fixed at 6 eV in low energy mode and ramped between 15-50

105

eV in high energy mode, with a scan time of 0.3 s for each mode. The cIM cell was

106

operated in one pass mode with 3 pushes per bin at a traveling wave height of 22 V.

107

Both drift and collision gases were N2. Column bleeding (C9H27O5Si5+: mass-to-charge

108

ratio 355.0705) was measured every 2 min for internal mass correction. CCS was

109

calibrated using a mixture of 22 compounds supplied by Waters Corp., following their

110

standard procedure. Tuning parameters are listed in the Table S1 in the Supporting

113

Optimization of instrumental parameters. For the above method, APCI source

114

parameters were optimized to minimize in-source fragmentation and enhance

115

sensitivity. Various settings were tested for auxiliary gas, cone gas, makeup gas, corona

116

current, and cone voltage under both wet and dry conditions. Given that HOCs often

117

contain halogen atoms which increase their molecular weight, tuning parameters were

118

optimized based on ions generated from column bleeding at 70 °C to increase intensities

119

of ions with higher mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). Optimization results are shown in the

120

Section A and Figure S1-3 in the SI.

121
122

Sample collection and preparation. To demonstrate the widespread applicability and

123

robustness of our method, a diverse set of sediments were analyzed, each influenced by

124

different sources of contamination and containing different concentrations of OC.

125

Surface marine sediments from the Baltic Sea (9 sites; 0-2 cm; 1.6-7.7% OC) were

126

impacted by both local sources and long-range transport. Surface lake sediment from

127

Lake Tyrifjorden, Norway (1 site; 0-2 cm; 4.5% OC) received emerging contaminants

128

(e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS]) primarily from a local paper

129

production plant.16 For marine sediments from the remote East Siberian Sea (2 sites; 0-

130

1 cm; 0.94-1.4% OC), we expected low concentrations of pollutants, primarily

131

associated with long-range transport and deposition. NIST standard reference material

132

(SRM; 1941b-Organics in Marine Sediment; 2.99% OC) was included for method

validation.17 Detailed sampling information and total organic carbon content (TOC) for

134

all sediment samples is provided in Section B and Table S2 of the SI.

135

The extraction method was modified from the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection

136

Agency) Method 3545A.18 Approximately 4 g of each freeze-dried sediment was

137

fortified with 28 isotope-labeled internal standards (IS; listed in Table S3 in the SI) and

138

extracted using an accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE 350; Dionex, U.S.A)

139

three times with 20 mL of acetone/n-hexane (1:1 v/v) per cycle. The static state was

140

held at 100 °C for 10 min. After rotary evaporation, sulfur was removed using activated

141

copper. Because of reduced fragment ions and lowered base line using APCI and HRMS,

142

no further cleanup was conducted in order to enhance throughput and avoid inadvertent

143

removal of nontarget substances. Finally, extracts were concentrated to approximately

144

200 μL under a nitrogen stream. Further details on the sample preparation method are

145

provided in Section C of the SI. All glassware was burned at 450 °C for 4 h, and metal

146

parts were ultrasonicated for 20 min using acetone. To prevent potential photolysis,

147

containers were either wrapped in aluminum foil or amber glassware was used.

Method validation and quality control. Analytical performance of the method was

150

evaluated using 102 standards for environmental contaminants (1.44< log Kow <16.8; -

151

9.31< log Kaw <11.3; Table S3 in the SI), including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

152

(PAHs), organophosphate esters (OPEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),

153

polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)

154

and other halogenated compounds.

155

Accuracy and precision of target HOC analysis was evaluated in two ways: Firstly,

156

by comparing triplicate measurements of SRM 1941b to certified concentrations; and

157

secondly, via spike/recovery experiments with Baltic sea sediment (58.26º N,16.91º E),

158

which was fortified in triplicate to ~1 ng g-1 dwt with a standard of each target.

159

Recoveries were calculated after subtracting background intensities obtained from

160

unfortified sediment. Lab contamination was monitored via procedural blanks (one per

161

batch) using diatomaceous earth (DE; Dionex, Thermo Scientific), which underwent

162

the same extraction process as sediments. Since intensities in blanks were negligible

163

compared to those in real samples, blank subtraction was not performed. Instrumental

164

detection limits (IDLs) were estimated based on standard deviations of peak area from

165

five replicate measurements of contaminant mixtures at the lowest detectable

166

concentrations, while method detection limits (MDLs) were the sum of concentrations

167

in procedural blanks and standard deviations of peak area using triplicates of fortified

168

sediment. Concentrations lower than MDLs were flagged in the target analysis. For

169

suspect and unknown compounds, relative intensities in samples lower than the average

170

plus three times the standard deviation of those in procedural blanks were considered

171

not detected.

172

For comparison of method sensitivity, IDLs and MDLs were also determined using

173

a low-resolution ISQLR GC-EI-MS (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A) and an 8890 GC-

174

ECNI-5977B MS (Agilent Technologies), both in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode.

175

Details of these methods are provided in Section D and Table S3 in the SI.

Target analysis. We quantified 102 HOCs using reference standards. The most intense

178

isotopic ion under either dry (typically M+.) or wet (typically [M+H]+) conditions was

179

selected as the quantitative ion, all of which are listed in Table S3 of the SI, along with

180

their preferred source conditions. After integration using Masslynx (version 4.2, Waters

181

Corp.), target compounds were quantified using the IS method with 1/x weighted

182

regression.

183
184

Suspect analysis. MS and MS2 data were exported separately from Progenesis QI

185

(version 3.0, Waters Corp.), following lockmass correction, pairing of precursor and

186

product ions, peak picking, and alignment. We retained peaks with maximum areas >3

187

times higher than that in procedural blanks for screening. Software parameters are

188

provided in Section E in the SI.

189

A multidimensional-constrained suspect screening method was employed as

190

previously described.19 Briefly, two suspect lists were compiled with information on

191

identity, exact mass, CCS, and retention time (RT). The first comprised 1,060 GC-

192

amenable compounds with experimentally-derived CCS values, previously reported in

193

the literature.13,20 The second included 530 chemicals derived from the Arctic

194

Monitoring and Assessment programme’s (AMAP’s) list of chemicals of emerging

195

Arctic concern and the European Chemical Agency’s (ECHA’s) list of substances of

196

very high concern.21,22 Peaks were matched against suspect lists by m/z, RT, and CCS.

197

MS2 similarity scores of candidates with matches in all three dimensions were further

198

evaluated using SIRIUS+CSI:FingerID (version 5.8.6).23 Eventually, multidimensional

High- and low-confidence thresholds (THRhigh and THRlow) were selected base on the

205

quality of suspect lists. W denotes the weight for each dimension. Score calculation was

206

explained in detail previously.19 Peaks with a multidimensional score >60% were

207

potential candidates, among which, the highest scoring peak was reported as putatively

208

identified (Confidence Level 2 according to the Schymanski scale24,25).

210

Non-target analysis. Halogenated organic compounds are distinguished by their

211

smaller size compared to non-halogenated compounds with similar mass, due to the

212

greater mass density of halogen atoms. In this study, peaks with CCS values lower than

213

a proposed CCS boundary (i.e., 100 Å2 + 20% mass) were preliminarily prioritized as

214

halogenated compounds.14 Molecular compositions were determined with the number

215

of halogen atoms constrained by isotopic patterns. Compounds at Confidence Level 1

216

were confirmed with a standard, while compounds classified as Confidence Level 2

217

were putatively identified with multidimensional and diagnostic information, according

218

to the Schymanski scale.24,25 SIRIUS+CSI:FingerID was used for in silico

219

interpretation.23 The candidate with the highest CSI:Finger ID score for each peak was

retained and categorized as Confidence Level 3. Remaining peaks were considered

221

Confidence Level 4.

222

For confirmation, 8:2/8:2 fluorotelomer disulfide was purchased from AKos GmbH

223

(Lörrach, Germany). Its 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum is provided

224

in the Figure S4 in the SI. 10:2 and 12:2 fluorotelomer methyl sulfones were custom

225

synthesized from Chiron (Trondheim, Norway).26

226
227

Semi-quantification. Fluorotelomer thiols and disulfides were semi-quantified using

228

the mole ionization efficiency of 8:2/8:2 fluorotelomer disulfide. Average mole

229

ionization efficiencies of 10:2 and 12:2 fluorotelomer methyl sulfones were used to

230

semi-quantify other fluorotelomer alkyl sulfones. For suspect and unknown compounds,

231

relative intensities (g-1 dwt) were calculated by normalizing the area of the compound

232

to the dry weight of the extracted sediment and the area of 1-ng IS (i.e., PCB47-13C12

233

and triphenylphosphate-d15 for the dry and wet conditions, respectively).

compounds, such as PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs, and halogenated benzenes, were ionized

through charge transfer without fragmentation. Under wet conditions, [M+H]+ was

predominantly the base ion for oxidized compounds and OPEs. In comparison, only

molecular ions of aromatic compounds were quantitative ions using EI, while only 68

250

halogenated compounds were ionized using ECNI, primarily with halogen ions as base

265

Owing to reduced fragmentation and lower base lines using APCI and HRMS,

266

MDLs for 71.6% of target compounds using the current technique were better than

267

those achieved with GC-EI-MS in SIM mode (Figure 1B). Notably, semi-fluorinated

268

alkanes and OPEs displayed orders of magnitude lower MDLs using GC-APCI

269

compared to GC-EI, likely due to reduced fragmentation using the former approach.

270

IDLs and MDLs using different methods for each compound are listed in the Table S3

271

in the SI.

272

IS-corrected recoveries for 67.6% of the target chemicals fell within the range of

273

70-130% with a standard deviation (STD) <30% (for compound-specific recoveries,

274

see Table S3 in the SI). The remaining compounds were mostly comprised of semi-

275

fluorinated alkanes and PBDEs. Low recoveries for these substances are likely

276

associated with the high volatility of the former and the susceptibility of the latter to

277

thermal degradation.

278

Among our target compounds, concentrations of 15 PAHs, 14 PCBs, and 3

279

organochlorine pesticides were consistent with certified concentrations in SRM 1941b,

280

with an average accuracy of 103% ± 31.6% (Figure S5 in the SI). Overall, the high

281

sensitivity, recovery, and accuracy of the method for a diverse range of HOCs

demonstrate its potential as a reliable technique for comprehensive contamination

observed in at least 1 sample, including PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs, organochlorines, and

288

OPEs (Figure 2). Concentrations for individual compounds cover five orders of

289

magnitude, ranging from 4.86 pg g-1 dwt to 124 ng g-1 dwt (concentrations are provided

290

in Table S4 of the SI). Sediment from the Baltic Sea contained the highest level of

291

contamination with average sum concentration of 403 ng g-1 dwt (Figure 2). In contrast,

292

contamination in the Arctic sediment, representing a remote area with little human

293

activity, is about six and three times lower than those in sediment from the Baltic Sea

294

and Lake Tyrifjorden, respectively.

HOC concentrations observed in sediments from the present work are comparable

299

to previously reported concentrations. For example, average concentrations of Σ16PAHs

300

and Σ7PCBs in sediment from the Swedish Baltic Sea coast (336 and 0.95 ng g-1 dwt,

301

respectively) are consistent with prior measurements from nearby locations (i.e.,

302

Σ16PAHs: 157-502 ng g-1 dwt and Σ7PCBs: 0.73-2.48 ng g-1 dwt).28 Similarly, for the

303

Arctic samples, average concentrations of Σ16PAHs (45.0 ng g-1 dwt) and Σ7PCBs (209

304

pg g-1 dwt) align with prior reports from the Chukchi Sea (14.4-218 ng g-1 dwt for

305

Σ16PAHs; 40.2 pg g-1 dwt Σ7PCBs)29 and East Siberian rivers (Σ7PCBs: 214-328 pg g-1

306

dwt).30,31

307

OPEs, used as flame retardants, plasticizers, and additives, have become an

308

emerging concern due to their increasing production after the effective regulation of

309

PBDEs.32 Their concentrations and composition varies with usage and proximity to

310

source. In this study, average concentrations of Σ5OPEs were 3.17 and 2.95 ng g-1 dwt

311

in Baltic Sea and Lake Tyrifjorden sediment, respectively, with tris(2-ethylhexyl)

312

phosphate as the predominant compound. Triphenylphosphate, tris(2-butoxyethyl)

313

phosphate, and 2-ethylhyexyl diphenyl phosphate were quantified in the Arctic

314

sediment and also previously reported in different matrices in the Arctic.33 Particularly,

315

the concentration of triphenylphosphate is close to those in a previous study in the

316

Chukchi Sea.34 Overall, these results further highlight the sensitivity and robustness of

317

the current method for a wide range of contaminants and concentration levels thereof.

technique presented here based on soft ionization and ion mobility mass spectrometry

321

offers valuable multidimensional information (i.e., MS, RT, CCS, and MS2) for

322

screening and structure elucidation. We screened 54 suspect compounds with

323

multidimensional scores >60% (Confidence Level 2 according to the Schymanski

324

scale), 28 of which are listed as chemicals of concern by AMAP or ECHA (Figure

A total of 16 features tentatively matched to substances on the AMAP chemicals

333

of emerging Arctic concern database. Among these substances, 11 were detected in the

334

East Siberian Sea sediment, including trichloronaphthalenes, 2,3',6-trichlorodiphenyl

335

ether, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and 2,2'-methylenebisphenol (Figure 3). Given the

336

remoteness of the Arctic from major urban settlements and chemical use, these results

337

emphasize the persistence and LRT of these substances. An additional 34 compounds

338

were found in the Arctic, but not listed in the AMAP chemicals of emerging Arctic

339

concern database (Figure 3). Some of these compounds showed similar relative

340

intensities across samples, indicating potential natural sources. Notably, 13 substances

341

exhibited relative intensities in Arctic sediment orders of magnitude lower than those

342

in other samples, suggesting their potential origin from long-range transport.

343

Particularly, estimated transfer efficiencies for dibenzopyrene isomers (5.38-8.77%),

344

bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulphone (6.42 %), and UV-328 (12.4%) were above reference

345

LRTP criteria (2.25%). Bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulphone is used in high temperature

346

plastics, while is a UV absorber in plastic applications. Both were identified as

347

persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances by ECHA, and UV-328 is under

348

investigation for inclusion in the United Nations Stockholm Convention on Persistent

349

Organic Pollutants. Additionally, high relative intensities of enzacamene, octoxinol,

350

tetrapropylene phenol, and isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate were observed in this study

351

(Figure 3). All of these are listed as ECHA substances of very high concern, due to their

352

potential endocrine disrupting properties.

CCS and m/z-based prioritization of halogenated compounds. In addition to

355

screening of compounds with a known structure, IM-derived CCS is a novel size

356

dimension for prioritization of unknown compounds, especially halogenated organic

357

compounds. The top 50 potential halogenated compounds with the highest intensity in

358

each region and condition were investigated after prioritization. In total, we obtained

359

the elemental composition of 192 peaks, detailed in Table S6 in the SI. For those peaks,

360

23 were validated by reference chemical standards. Structures of 22 compounds were

361

assigned considering multidimensional or diagnostic information. We annotated 32

362

peaks using an in silico tool.

363

Specifically, the major halogenated compounds detected in the SRM 1941b were

364

anthropogenic chlorinated compounds. In addition to PCB congeners and chlorinated

365

benzenes, higher relative intensities of potential dichlorodiphenyl sulfone isomers and

366

polychloronaphthalene congeners were observed. In contrast, halogenated compounds

367

in the Arctic sediment were primarily natural compounds, such as bromophenolic

368

compounds and halogenated carbazoles. These naturally occurring compounds share

369

similar structures with anthropogenic bioaccumulative contaminants and could pose a

370

risk to biota.35 The sediment from the Baltic Sea contained a mixture of anthropogenic

371

and natural halogenated compounds.

372

Notably, 34 unknown fluorinated features with high relative intensities were

373

prioritized in Lake Tyrifjorden sediments (Figure 4A). Among them, 15 were in-source

374

fragments, while the remaining were molecular ions. The elemental composition of

375

potential neutral PFAS included F(CF2)n(CH2)xSH (x=2, n=10, 12, 14, and 16; x=3,

376

n=8), F2(CF2)n(CH2)xS2 (x=4, n=14, 16, 18, and 20; x=6, n=16 and 18),

377

F(CF2)nC5H9S2O (n=8, 10, and 12), F(CF2)nC3H7SO2 (n=8, 10, 12, and 14) and

378

F(CF2)8C4H7SO2. A previous study in the same lake found high concentrations of

379

fluorotelomer sulfonate homologues (FTS) in sediment, due to the discharge from paper

380

production factories.16 All neutral PFAS detected the present work contain a

381

perfluorinated chain, a hydrocarbon chain with at least C2, and sulfur atom(s).

382

Therefore, we hypothesized that all of these unknown compounds have a fluorotelomer

383

structure.

390

Structures of these compounds were tentatively deduced, based on the in-source

391

fragments. Due to the presence of [M-F-SH2]+ (Figure S6A in the SI), F(CF2)n(CH2)xSH

392

were likely fluorotelomer thiols. Based on the cleavage of S-S bond (Figure S6B),

393

F2(CF2)n(CH2)xS2 was tentatively identified as fluorotelomer disulfides, and later

394

confirmed with an authentic standard (i.e., 8:2/8:2 fluorotelomer disulfide).

395

F(CF2)nC3H7SO2 and F(CF2)8C4H7SO2 were identified as potential fluorotelomer alkyl

396

sulfones, based on the loss of alkyl group (Figure S6C-D). We confirmed 10:2 and 12:2

397

fluorotelomer methyl sulfones with reference chemical standards. In summary, we

398

identified novel thiol, disulfide, and alkyl sulfone forms of fluorotelomers.

399

Fluorotelomer thiols are a precursor of fluorotelomer mercaptoalkyl phosphate

400

esters (FTMAP), also known as S-diPAP marketed under the tradename Lodyne

401

P208E.36 These compounds were used as fluorinated surfactants in food packaging

402

since 1995. Detection of these neutral PFAS aligns with previous hypotheses regarding

403

the application of mixtures of FTS precursors, such as FTMAP and 3-[2-

404

(perfluoroalkyl)ethylthio] propionate (marketed as Zonyl FSA) in the factories

405

upstream of the sampling site.16

406

The semi-quantified concentrations are provided in Table S4 in the SI. The sum

407

concentrations of neutral PFAS in the Norwegian lake sediment was 96.1 ng g-1 dwt

408

with 88.3% attributed to fluorotelomer disulfides (Figure 4B). This value is three times

409

higher than the total concentration of FTS (30.9 ng g-1 dwt).16 Only 12:2 fluorotelomer

410

thiol and 8:2/8:2 fluorotelomer disulfide were detected in the Baltic Sea sediment, while

411

fluorotelomer methyl sulfones appeared in almost all samples. Notably, 8:2

412

fluorotelomer methyl sulfone was detected in one of the Arctic sediment samples

413

(Figure 4B). Its 10:2 and 12:2 homologues were previously detected in the blubber of

414

killer whales from Greenland.26 Therefore, these results underscore the widespread

415

environmental distribution and persistence of these substances.

416

CCS values of neutral PFAS observed here are linearly associated with their m/z,

417

which has also been observed for polar PFAS measured with LC-ESI systems (Figure

418

4C).37 Due to the instrument-independence of both CCS values and m/z, these class-

419

specific trends can be leveraged to comprehensively prioritize and identify these groups

420

of compounds across different sample types, facilitating further investigation of their

421

sources and health effects.

422
423

Implications. Using GC-APCI-IM-HRMS, a powerful workflow for screening of

424

HOCs in environmental samples was established and enabled us to detect and/or

425

quantify 56 target, 54 suspect, and 56 unknown compounds with CL ≤3 in sediment

426

samples. A series of novel neutral fluorotelomer thiols, disulfides, and alkyl sulfones

427

were identified in sediment for the first time with their m/z and CCS trends reported for

428

further comprehensive screening. GC-APCI can effectively preserve (quasi-) molecular

429

ions for HOCs, and IM-HRMS can acquire confirmatory CCS as a semi-orthogonal

430

dimension. In addition to wide-scope quantification and highly specific suspect

431

screening, their combination has great potential for de novo elucidation of unknown

432

halogenated compounds and transplantation of in silico technique. Therefore, GC-

433

APCI-IM-HRMS could be a next-generation technique for analyzing HOCs in complex
