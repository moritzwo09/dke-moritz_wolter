Dyeing to Know: Harmonizing Nile Red Staining Protocols for Microplastic Identification
Abstract:
With the escalation of microplastic (MPs) pollution and the laborious nature of existing MPs
identification methods, new approaches for large-scale sampling of MPs in the environment are
necessary. A promising solution lies in the fluorescence staining of Nile Red (NR), whose
fluorescence is polarity-dependent, offering the potential for classification based on fluorescence.
However, the choice of carrier solvents to dissolve NR remains unstandardized, and methods to
represent and differentiate the fluorescent behavior of MPs are lacking. This study addresses
these gaps by testing eight NR-carrier solvents (n-hexane, chloroform, acetone, methanol,
ethanol, acetone/hexane, acetone/ethanol, and acetone/water) applied to ten most common
polymer-types of MPs (HDPE, LDPE, PP, EPS, PS, PC, ABS, PVC, PET, and PA). The
fluorescence behavior, including fluorescence intensity and Stokes shift, was compared across
solvents, and their effects on polymer degradation were evaluated. Additionally, the
effectiveness of various polarity measures with the proposed HSV color spaces in reflecting
Stokes shift for MPs identification was assessed. To differentiate natural organic materials (e.g.,
eggshells, fingernails, wood, and cotton) from polymers, Fenton oxidation was found to quench
the fluorescence of natural organic matter with minimal changes observed in NR-stained MPs.
The findings identified acetone/water [25% (v/v)] as the best compromise, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of acetone while maintaining strong fluorescence behavior suitable for
identification.

1. Introduction
The usage of plastic products has skyrocketed, climbing from 2 million tons in the 1950s
to a staggering 450 million tons over 70 years [1]. This surge, notably accelerated by the Covid19 pandemic, resulted in an estimated 8.4 ±1.4 million tons of pandemic-associated plastic waste
generated globally in 2021 [2]. This influx equates to approximately 2,000 garbage trucks' worth
of plastics dumped into the world's oceans daily [3]. Unfortunately, the chemical resilience that
makes plastics so popular inadvertently means they do not biodegrade. Instead, they fragment
through processes like UV oxidation, mechanical breakdown, and biological degradation [4], [5],
[6], [7]. This fragmentation leads to smaller pieces known as microplastics (<5 mm), and
eventually, nanoplastics (<1 µm).
The tiny size and omnipresence of these microplastics (MPs) enable their global transport
through air and water, leading to startling discoveries in remote locations such as the Arctic ice
[8], uninhabited caves [9], the highest peak of Mount Everest [10], and even the deepest parts of
the Mariana Trench [11]. This increased prevalence of MPs holds profound implications for both
the flora [12], [13] and fauna [14] residing in these environments. Moreover, their small size
leads animals to mistake them for food, causing adverse effects such as oxidative stress, neuroand reproductive-toxicity, and carcinogenicity [15]. Recent discoveries of microplastics in our
food sources—like fruits and vegetables [16], seafood [17] and salt [18], and even water bottles
[22] and food packaging [23], and their accumulation in placenta [21] and blood [22] of healthy
humans —have raised concerns. With limited understanding of their profound effects on human
health and projections indicating a potential doubling of microplastics in oceans within the next
30 years from 2020 levels [23], there is an urgent need for standardized monitoring approaches
capable of handling large sample numbers and volumes within short periods to study spatial and

temporal distribution of MPs [24]. Such approaches are critical for comprehensive assessments,
comparison and integration of research on microplastic presence across diverse environments.
The most commonly used methods for detecting and identifying MPs rely on visual
assessment with the naked eye, cameras, or microscopes, followed by spectroscopic validation
using techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) or Raman spectroscopy [25], [26].
While widely adopted, these approaches face significant limitations: they are labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and prone to a high rate of false positives due to subjective operator selection
criteria during MPs analysis [27], [28]. For instance, relying on distinct visual features such as
color and surface structure (i.e. sharp geometrical shapes, shiny surfaces and fibers with
consistent widths), often leads to the underestimation of less visually obvious plastics, such as
clear, black, white, brown fragments [29]. This subjective, label-free selection process frequently
results in misidentification rates ranging from 20–70% [30]. Alternative methods, such as
thermal analysis techniques (e.g., thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermal extraction
desorption (TED), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS)), have been
proposed for MPs identification [31]. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks.
They cannot determine the number, type, or morphology of MPs, and are unsuitable for
analyzing large samples due to overlapping polymer signal peaks and lengthy analysis times
(e.g., approximately 70 minutes per sample with PY-GC/MS) [25], [31], [32]. Therefore, it is
critical to develop faster, more accurate, and objective methods for MPs detection and
identification that are accessible to laboratories worldwide. Such advancements will improve the
reliability and scalability of MPs research and monitoring efforts.
To address these challenges, researchers have turned to fluorescent labelling methods,
including but not limited to, DANS, methylene blue, Evans blue and DAPI, and Nile red (NR)

[29]. Among these options, NR was selected due to its widespread adoption across international
laboratories, as well as its exceptional selectivity and minimal interference in the infrared
spectral region, which enables subsequent spectroscopic identification via FTIR [29]. NR
fluoresces selectively, preferentially binding onto hydrophobic materials, like lipids and plastics,
in polar environments, rather than inorganic materials, like sand [29]. Importantly, its
fluorescence behavior varies on the physiochemical properties of the plastics, suggesting the
potential to differentiate MPs based on their polarity-dependent fluorescence behaviors [33],
[34], [35].
However, applying NR requires a carrier solvent to effectively disperse the dye onto
MPs. Various solvents, including N-hexane, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, DMSO, Tween 20,
acetone/ethanol, and acetonitrile/methanol, have been explored to optimize NR fluorescence
while minimizing adverse effects, such as plastic dissolution or swelling [29]. Despite these
efforts, the absence of a standardized solvent has hindered progress in the field of MPs research,
leading to inconsistent results, such as the underestimation of low-fluorescing MPs,
overestimation of the MPs particle count due to false positives of natural organic matter (NOM),
and inaccurate particle size determination due to swelling, and lack of cross-study comparability
[36].
To address these inconsistencies, researchers have attempted to investigate the underlying
mechanism regarding NR partitioning onto MPs within a multiphasic system. Shim et al. (2016)
proposed that non-polar solutions like n-hexane, facilitate improved partitioning of NR
fluorophores onto MPs, thereby enhancing the fluorescence of MPs [37]. Conversely, Tamminga
et al. (2017) found that more polar solvents, such as chloroform, produced higher fluorescence in
NR-stained PE and PP compared to n-hexane [38]. This apparent contradiction highlights the

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
complexity of the underlying mechanism governing NR partitioning onto MPs and fluorescence
behavior in a multiphasic system. As a result, developing a standardized solvent for NR staining
remains a challenge, compounded by the diverse fluorescence and degradation tendencies of
plastic types in different solvents.
In addition to solvent challenges, methods used to quantify and differentiate the
fluorescent behavior of MPs are inadequate. Imaging devices, such as cameras, cannot capture
fluorescence at discrete wavelengths (nm); instead, they interpret the perceived fluorescence as a
permutation of red, green, and blue (R/G/B) channels. This limitation complicates the direct
identification of MPs based on their fluorescence behavior. As a workaround, researchers
commonly convert fluorescent images to monochrome and apply greyscale thresholding based
on pixel brightness to isolate particles with fluorescent intensity (FI - %) above a certain
threshold. While this approach enables an approximate differentiation of MPs by their
crystallinity – since FI decreases with polymer crystallinity [34], [39], [40] – it is prone to false
positives. For instance, NOM, such as wood and chitin [40], often exhibit a higher FI than highly
crystalline plastics - polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [40].
To improve MPs differentiation, researchers have explored RGB-based interpretation of
fluorescence, developing formulaic representations of RGB, (Red+Green/Red), (RedBlue/Red+Blue), or even their layered combinations to create proxy ‘polarity index’ fingerprints
[34], [35], [38]. However, these RGB-based approaches have shown limited success in reliably
correlating solvent polarity with the Stokes shift in fluorescence, reducing their effectiveness in
classifying MPs based on their fluorescence behavior. Without a more robust digital
representation of polarity-induced Stokes shift of fluorescence, fluorescence imaging analyses

remain susceptible to false positives, and cannot accurately classify MPs by their fluorescent
behavior.
This study seeks to address these challenges by evaluating the efficacy of the most
common carrier solvents used for NR staining in accurately identifying 10 types of MPs (highdensity polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP),
polystyrene (PS), expanded polystyrene (EPS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS),
polycarbonate (PC), PVC, PET, polyamide (PA)) based on their fluorescence behavior (FI and
Stokes shift). Additionally, a rapid, simple, and cost-effective staining protocol applicable to
environmental samples was developed, integrating Fenton oxidation and NR staining. This
protocol, combined with the application of a more appropriate Hue/Saturation/Value (HSV)
color space for fluorescence representation, was assessed for its ability to differentiate MPs
based on polarity-induced fluorescence.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Sample collection for staining experiments
Ten non-colored polymer-types (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, EPS, ABS, PC, PVC, PET, PA)
were investigated. Non-colored HDPE, LDPE, PP and ABS virgin pellets were obtained from
LNS technologies, PS was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (#331651), PA was obtained from
GUM Waxed floss. The other plastics (EPS, PC, PVC, PET) were obtained from post-consumer
products in the form of packing peanuts, acrylic glass sheets, PVC pipes and Dawn Ultra dish
soap bottles. All-purpose cotton thread was obtained from Coats & Clark, chitin was sourced
from eggshells and fingernails, wood shavings from Jack pine softwood. Due to the irregular

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
shapes of the prepared MPs from post-consumer goods, the dimensions of the particles ranged
from as thin as 0.96 mm to as long as 2.09 cm, such as in the case of PA thread. However, the
average between the minimum width and maximum length of the MPs studied ranged from
between ABS (3.14 mm) to PET (5.42 mm) except for PA (10.93 mm), due to the high lengthbreath ratio of its thread.

2.2 Staining dye solution
The five most used solvents by researchers, namely n-hexane (Hex), chloroform (Chl),
acetone (Ac), ethanol (Eth), and methanol (Met) were investigated. Additionally, three equal-part
solvent mixtures of acetone with n-hexane (Ac-Hex), with ethanol (Ac-Eth), and with water (AcW) were used to prepare NR stock solutions of 10 µg/ml. These NR-carrier solvents (Hex, Chl,
Ac, Met, Eth, Ac/Hex, Ac/Eth & Ac/W) were applied to nine different types of MPs (HDPE,
LDPE, PP, PS, PC, ABS, PVC, PET & PA) to assess their ability to stain MPs with NR for
fluorescence imaging. The inclusion of pure water was disregarded since NR was demonstrated
to be insoluble in water. Nile Red (7385-67-3) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Nhexane (110-54-3), chloroform (67-66-3), acetone (67-64-1), ethanol (64-17-5), and methanol
(67-56-1) were obtained from Fischer Scientific company LLC. Ultrapure (Type 1) water was
obtained from Synergy UV water purification system (18.2 MΩ.cm @25°C).

2.3 Fenton oxidation pretreatment
Of the several pretreatment methods available, including acid, alkali, oxidase, and
enzymatic treatments, Fenton oxidation was chosen. Acid and alkali pretreatments have been
shown to cause degradation and yellowing of the polymer [41], respectively. Additionally,

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
enzymatic pretreatment requires a lengthy digestion period [41]. As such, we adapted the Fenton
oxidation pretreatment from Masura et al. (2015) [42], excluding the density separation with a
salt solution to ensure the inclusion of MPs of all densities. Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate
(FeSO4·7H2O) (7782-63-0), concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) (7664-93-9), Whatman 47mm
2.5 µm Grade 42 filter paper was obtained from Fischer Scientific company LLC. Hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) 30% (v/v) (7732-18-5) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The
Fe(II) stock solution was prepared by adding 7.5g of FeSO4°7H2O to 500 mL of water and 3 mL
of concentrated sulfuric acid [42]. To prepare the samples for Fenton oxidation, 2 ml Fe(II) stock
was added to 2 ml H2O2 to a test tube with 3 pieces of MPs, and immersed in a water bath set at
70°C for 30 minutes in a fume hood, with periodic agitation every 10 minutes to ensure mixing.
MPs were then filtered out of the Fenton solution onto the 47 mm filter paper with a membrane
vacuum filtration apparatus.

2.4 NR staining of MPs
15 ml of NR solution was added to the test tube and placed into a water bath (70°C) for
30 minutes in a fume hood, with periodic agitation every 10 minutes to ensure even staining.
Plastics stained with Chl were treated at room temperature in a fume hood and covered with
aluminum foil for 24 hours. Subsequently, one of each of the plastic particles was selected and
positioned on the 47 mm filter paper and arranged in the order of their supposed polarity. To
evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation of non-overlapping particles the particles were
arranged with tweezers on a 47 mm filter paper for fluorescence imaging.

2.5 Fluorescence illumination and imaging instrumentation
The NR-stained particles illuminated with a circular illumination lighting setup consisting
of four 310 nm LED (CUD1GF1A) positioned equidistant 10 cm apart, placed 2 cm above the
samples and emitted 0.3 lx of light (as measured by Professional LED Dr.meter Light Meter
B07LF4BT8V). Images were photographed with Canon RP mirrorless camera equipped with a
100 mm f/2.8 macro lens (f/2.8, t= 15 s, ISO 100, 4072 x 4072 pixels, Colour correction= 2500
K) with a High Dynamic range (HDR) obtained using the in-built HDR function (EV±1). This
resulted in a replicable captured image of absolute exposure value of EV 1±1 and fixed luminous
exposure value of 4.5 lx.s.

2.6 Quantifying fluorescence behavior differences
Given the limitations of using RGB color space for polarity-dependent classification,
particularly its inability to accurately represent Stokes shift, alternative color spaces like CIE
L*u*v* and HSV were evaluated. The CIE L*u*v* color space represents color in perceptually
uniform dimensions: Lightness (L*) on a scale of 0–100, chromaticity along the red-green axis
(u*) and the chromaticity along the blue-yellow axis (v*), This perceptual uniformity aligns
closely with human color perception, making it ideal in detecting subtle color differences. In
contrast, HSV represents colors in a cylindrical model based on Hue (0–360°, corresponding to
the dominant wavelength), Saturation (0–100%, indicating color purity), and Value (0–100%,
denoting brightness). HSV was chosen as the color space classifying fluorescent images for
several reasons: (1) Hue intuitively corresponds to the dominant fluorescent wavelength,
enabling clear differentiation of fluorescence color; (2) the independence of hue from brightness
ensures consistent color identification regardless of variations in illumination, aligning with the

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
monochromatic nature of fluorescent images; (3) Saturation effectively captures the purity of
fluorescent colors, while intensity is better represented by the Value channel [43]. Together,
these relationships provide a more intuitive and accurate characterization of fluorescent images,
allowing for weighted emphasis on the channels, which enhances classification precision and
supports improved polarity differentiation.
For each of the MPs analyzed, the HSV color was sampled using the ‘eyedropper’ tool in
photoshop of five points within the particle (top, center, bottom, leftmost and rightmost) and
averaged. To represent FI, the Value component of the greyscale image in the HSV color space,
where 0 represents pure black and 100% represents pure white, was used. The greyscale and
color values were obtained by averaging the HSV color data of the three stained MPs; and can be
found in Table S1.

2.7 FTIR analysis of Pretreated and NR-stained MPs
Duplicates of the FTIR spectrum of the 10 MPs (Control, Fenton treated, Fenton-treated
and NR-stained) were obtained using Nicolet iS50R FTIR with the IRIS ATR adapter. The
spectral range of 4000–400 cm-1 with 50 scans, resolution of 4 and 100% aperture was used for
spectral analysis.

2.8 Spectral behavior analysis of NR-stained MPs
In the absence of a spectrophotometer, a retrofitted multispectral camera with four
selective bandpass filters was employed to isolate and compare fluorescence behaviors across the
spectral range. Cokin optical transmission filters were used: green, yellow, orange, and red. The
longpass filters had cutoff points of 510 nm (yellow), 580 nm (orange), and 620 nm (red), while

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
the green filter, a dual-bandpass filter, exhibited transmission peaks at 500 nm (green light) and
beyond 715 nm. FI measurements of the MPs were taken at three distinct locations—center, top,
and bottom—to account for intra-particle variations.

2.9 Quality Assurance / Quality Control
Attention to Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) in microplastics research is
imperative to verify accuracy of data collection, ability to compare results, and replication of
investigations. Polymers purchased for this project, in general, included standard non-colored
pellets from semi-transparent to opaque with sizes ranging from ~1-6 mm long dimensions.
Environmental samples included non-colored eggshells, fingernails, PET bottles, and fibers cut
to similar dimensions to the polymer pellets. All types were verified using FTIR analysis.
Investigations were completed in a clean laboratory fume hood due to the use of volatile
chemicals. The researcher wore a black lab coat in contrast to the clear to white materials used to
easily identify potential contamination. When polymers were tested at least three locations were
used on the surfaces of each piece. Experiments were repeated in triplicate to ensure replication
of results. Due to the size of the materials used for this project, any appearance of fibers or
potential polymer contaminants were manually removed to confirm clear representation of
observations.

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
To assess the effectiveness of NR-carrier solvents (Hex, Chl, Ac, Met, Eth, Ac/Hex,
Ac/Eth & Ac/W) on eliciting fluorescence in MPs, one stained MPs of each solvent were
arranged clockwise (see Figure 1a), starting with PP (top, right of line), followed by HDPE,
LDPE, PS, PC, ABS, PVC, PET & PA (top, left of line). The optimal NR carrier solvent will be
evaluated as one that is able to (i) elicit strong FI across all the MPs studied, (ii) minimal
polymer degradation and (iii) reflect the polarity-induced Stokes shift of MPs.
Among the pure solvents studied, Chl exhibited the highest average FI for the nine
plastics (FI: 64.2%), followed by Ac (53.4%), Met (53.0%), Hex (51.7%), and Eth (28.1%), as
shown by the dashed lines in Figure 1b. This order deviates from the expected trend based on
solvent polarity, where highly non-polar solvents was expected to enhance NR partitioning onto
the MPs, thus supposedly increasing fluorescence (e.g., Hex > Chl > Ac > Met > Eth).
Within individual solvents, the FI of the MPs varies depending on their molecular
interactions with the solvent. In Hex, aliphatic MPs (e.g., PP (93.3%) & LDPE (83.3%), except
for HDPE (46.7%) due to its high crystallinity), exhibit stronger FI than the other MPs,
especially PC (18.3%). However, some MPs in Hex, like PP and PS, experience adverse swelling
due to the expansion of the polymer matrix and making these plastics appear larger. In Chl, most
MPs exhibit strong fluorescence, with PET showing the lowest FI of 36.0%. Despite the
promotion of FI of all MPs, Chl induces adverse degradation in many MPs, particularly causing
complete dissolution of those with aromatic groups (PS, ABS, and PC), swelling certain MPs
like PET and PVC. MPs stained with Ac also exhibit strong fluorescence across all MPs, with
PET showing the weakest FI of 38.3%. However, Ac induces dissolution of MPs with aromatic
groups (PS, ABS, PVC) and swelling with PC and PET. In Met, most MPs elicit fluorescence
greater than 37.3%, except for PC (24%), whereas in Eth, the MPs (PP, HDPE, LDPE, PC)

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
barely elicit fluorescence, with some plastics PS, ABS, PET, only visible due to their
autofluorescence.
The disparity in FI (Met: 53.0% & Eth: 28.1%) is notable considering that these alcohols,
Met and Eth, share a similar hydroxyl functional group, which is known to quench fluorescence
[44], yet exhibit significantly different FI. This variance in FI could be attributed to the smaller
molecular size of Met (3.80 Å) [45] compared to Eth (4.14 Å) [46], facilitating better absorption
of NR into the polymer matrix. Unlike Met, which did not result in any observable degradation,
Eth-stained PET and PA appeared to swell and unravel respectively. It is worth noting that the
background filter’s FI is 20%, making some MPs, such as PC (18.3%) in Hex, PC (24%) in Met,
and PP (21.7%), HDPE (20.3%), LDPE (20.7%), PC (22%) in Eth, difficult to distinguish from
the filter paper using standard greyscale thresholding techniques.
In addition to concerns FI and polymer degradation, it is crucial to consider how
accurately fluorescence reflects the polarity-induced Stokes shift of the plastic. Figure 1c
provides insight into this Stokes shift, presenting the average color samples of the plastics (Figure
1a) arranged in ascending polarity. Utilizing the HSV (Hue/Saturation/Value) color space, where
primary colors - red (0°), green (120°), and blue (240°) - can help us better understand the effects
of polarity-induced Stokes shift. It is expected that MPs with higher polarity would exhibit a
more significant red-shift (counter-clockwise degree shift). Analyzing the solvents with a strong,
consistent FI, it was found that Ac and Chl are the only two solvents reflecting the anticipated
evolution of red-shift in polarity from PP to PA (refer to Figure 1c and Table S1). The colors of
PP to PA evolve from green (154°) to red (339°) in Ac and yellow (73°) to red (351°) in Chl,
resulting in a spectrum range difference of 82° and 175°, respectively. This difference in
spectrum range is attributed to the solvent-dependent polarity-shift of Chl, making all MPs,

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
especially aliphatic ones (PP, HDPE, LDPE), appear more red-shifted. For instance, compared to
PP in other solvents (Hex’s 91°, Ac’s 154°, and Met’s 180°), which appears green, PP in Chl
experiences a red-shift, appearing yellow (73°).
In summary, each pure solvent studied possesses unique advantages and disadvantages as
an NR carrier solvent for a wide range of MPs. Hex, despite being the most non-polar solvent,
falls short in yielding the strongest FI and induces adverse swelling in some plastics. Chl exhibits
the strongest FI for all MPs but causes complete deformation in plastics with styrene groups (PS
and ABS) and PVC. Alcohols (Met and Eth) show limited degradation but poor fluorescence
across most polymers. Although not as bright as Chl and with some dissolution of the polymer
structure, Ac has been proven to induce fluorescence in all nine MPs studied. Furthermore, the
extended color spectrum of Ac makes it more suitable for clearly distinguishing between plastics.
To enhance the applicability of solvents to a broader range of polymers while mitigating adverse
effects, the mixing of Ac with other solvents was explored to enhance NR staining and the
fluorescence of MPs.

3.2 Solvent Mixtures
Ac was mixed with three solvents possessing distinct chemical properties, specifically, (i)
non-polar solvent n-hexane, (ii) highly polar solvent water, and (iii) moderately polar ethanol
[47]. It is believed that the combined properties of these solvent pairs could elicit greater NR
partitioning or lower degradation. The TEAs graph was used to illustrate the three component
forces of solubility interactions: hydrogen bonding force (fh), polar forces (fp), and dispersion
force (fd), projected on a triangle plot to represent their relative component contribution to the
total Hildebrand value [48]. The TEAs graph is often used to predict and formulate solvent

mixtures with different chemical properties through interpolation between the solvents
qualitatively assess the effect of solvents on polymers [48].

Figure 2: TEAs graph illustrating solvent class and its polymer solubility windows. Solubility windows are indicated in color
shaded circles (Blue-alcohols, yellow – ketones, red- amines, gray- aliphatic, green – chlorine, purple – aromatics, pink – esters),
solvents are represented by the lettered circles (Ac, Chl, Hex, Met, Eth, W, Ac/W, Ac/Eth, Ac/Hex) and the plastics are
represented in numbered squares (1-PE, 2- PP, 3-PS, 4-ABS, 5-PC, 6-PVC, 7-PET & 8 – PA).

The adapted TEAs graph [48] (see Figure 2) illustrates the relative positions of solvents
and polymers, enabling their classification into solvent classes within arbitrarily shaded
regions—alcohols (blue), ketones (yellow), amines (red), aliphatic (grey), chlorine (green),
aromatics (purple), and esters (pink). These shaded regions, referred to as "polymer solubility
windows," were empirically derived by researchers who charted the proximity of a polymer to
particular region(s) indicating potential solubility in those solvents [48]. By adapting the regions
of solubility windows [48] and superimposing the positions of solvents (circles) and polymers of
interest (squares) [49] onto the TEAs graph (refer to Table S2), the effect of solvents on

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
polymers can be qualitatively assessed. For example, in Figure 2, it can be observed that the
proximity of ABS, PS, PVC, PET, and PE in the green shaded region where Chl resides,
indicates a high degree of chemical compatibility in Chl, resulting in greater
swelling/dissolution. This dissolution rate aligns with our observed deformation (as evident in
Figure 1a) of ABS, PS, PVC, PET. It is noteworthy that due to the focus on the interaction of
solvents with the amorphous regions of polymers, the TEAs graph may not fully represent the
effect of higher ordered crystalline structures (i.e., HDPE vs LDPE) and the absence of reactive
groups (PE and PP) that make some plastics chemically resistant to solvents. Despite the
potential of the TEAs graph to help visualize the solubility of polymers in solvents, caution must
be exercised as it is a 2-dimensional simplification of complex chemical compatibility and it
excludes important factors like temperature (>25°C), concentration of solvents (>10%), and
exposure time [48].
Compared to just Hex, the addition of Ac to Hex improved the FI of several MPs
(Average FI: 64.8%), namely PC (52.0%), PVC (71.3%), and HDPE (78.3%). However, this
Ac/Hex mixture also resulted in enhanced dissolution of the polymer matrix of PS, ABS, PVC,
and PET, as well as swelling of HDPE (See Figure 1a). These more pronounced adverse effects
can be explained by the TEAs graph (Figure 2), which positions the Ac/Hex mixture in a region
proximate to where most of the investigated polymers lie, resulting in higher compatibility for
solubilization.
The mixture of Ac/Eth improved the fluorescence of several MPs (average FI: 27.3%),
specifically PS (32.0%), ABS (38.0%), PVC (59.0%), PA (59.3%), and to a limited degree PP
(27.3%), LDPE (28.0%), PC (22.0%), and PET (23.0%), compared to pure Eth. Though
improved, the FI of the Ac/Eth remains suppressed due to presence of the fluorescence

quenching properties of the ethanol. However, the Ac/Eth mixture did mitigate against the
dissolution of all the plastics and even maintained the integrity of the wax of the PA fibers.
Lastly, the Ac/W mixture was found to elicit the strongest fluorescence across all the 9
MPs (average: 71.3%), compared to all solvents studied. In addition to this improved FI,
specifically PS, PC, and PET, the Ac/W demonstrated a reduction in the degradation of PS, ABS,
PC, and PVC, as reflected by their increased distance away from these MPs in the TEAs graph.
Despite water being more polar and exhibiting stronger fluorescence-quenching hydrogen
bonding than Eth, it was found that Ac/W elicited greater fluorescence than Ac/Eth. It is
suspected that the smaller molecular size of water (1.62 Å) relative to the 4.14 Å of Eth and 4.19
Å of Ac [46] promoted greater penetration of NR into the polymer matrix, improving
fluorescence. Therefore, after comparing the three different Ac/mixtures, it is concluded that
Ac/W appears to be the best compromise eliciting strong fluorescence with minimal degradation
and will be used in further investigation.

3.3 Optimizing Ac/W mixtures
To optimize the Ac/W mixture, a combination of Ac/W ranging from 10-70% acetone,
with the rest containing water, was investigated. These Ac/W solvent mixtures were tested on the
MPs most sensitive to degradation – PS, PC, ABS, PVC and PET; with expanded PS (EPS)
added to ensure better applicability to MPs with different crystallinity (see Figure 3). The MPs
were arranged in a clockwise fashion with 10% (top, right of line) to 70% (top, left of line). In
Figure 3a, it was observed that at low concentrations of Ac/W, specifically at 10% (right of the
line), there was minimal fluorescence visibility of EPS and PC. With increasing concentration of
Ac in the mixture, there was a noticeable red-shift in the NR fluorescence, intensifying to its

reddest state at Ac/W 70%. Additionally, at higher concentrations, EPS appeared to shrink in
size due to its tendency to dissolve in Ac. However, as the concentration of Ac increased, the
greater the degree of malformation of the MPs, resulting in the fusion with neighboring MPs,
such as in the case of PS (Ac >30%) and ABS (Ac >40%), and the warping of PET (Ac >60%).

To investigate how the color of the MPs changes with Ac/W concentration, a graph

Data points of EPS (-63°) and PC (-65°) of Ac/W at 10% were excluded due to their lack of
fluorescence. In Figure 3b, it was found that certain plastics exhibited distinct hue peaks, such as
PS (25%), PVC (20%), PET (25%), and PC (30%), indicating dominant hues before a red-shift

(decreasing hue) occurred with increasing solvent polarity. Considering the range of dominant
hue peaks and the tendency for solubilization at higher concentrations of Ac, it appears that an
Ac/W mixture between 20–30% is suitable. Therefore, a compromise of 25% as the
concentration of Ac/W was deemed to be the most optimal solution for reflecting polarityinduced fluorescence.

Figure 4b (right): Simplified two-dimensional HSV color wheel (Hue (360°) & Saturation (radial axis -%) without Value
projections) of NR-stained MPs labeled in Figure 4a. As the polarity of MPs increases, the Hue of the MPs is red-shifted counterclockwise. Plastics with higher saturation (%) would appear further away from the center of the color wheel. (From Rightmost,
anti-clockwise – 1.PP, 2.HDPE, 3.LDPE, 4.EPS, 4.PS, 5.PC, 6.ABS, 7.PVC, 8.PET, 9.PA)

To ensure environmental applicability and accurate correlation of these measures of
polarity with the fluorescence of NR-stained MPs, ten types of MPs (PP, HDPE, LDPE, EPS,
PS, PC, ABS, PVC, PET & PA) were subject to Fenton-oxidation pretreatment and stained with
a 25% Ac/W mixture. The MPs were then arranged in a clockwise fashion based on their hue
(see Figure 4a). A simplified 2D representation of the 3D HSV color space of the MPs was

created, illustrating the angular position of Hue (360°) of the color wheel, with the outward
radial axis representing saturation (%) (without the dimension of Value), as shown in Figure 4b.
The plastics are labelled according to their increasing red-shift in dominant wavelength, ranging
from green to red — #1.PP, #2.HDPE, #3.LDPE, #4.PS+EPS, #5.PC, #6.ABS, #7.PVC, #8.PET,
#9.PA. A clear trend in the red-shift of the fluorescence of MPs is evident in the counterclockwise progression of the dominant hue (°), from green PP (#1) to red PA (#9), as depicted in
Figure 4b.
Polarity, defined as the imbalance in electronegativity among molecules and atoms, can be
assessed through physical surface properties like water contact angle (WCA) and dielectric
charge, or approximated using chemical properties such as partitioning coefficients, as
summarized in Table 1. WCA measurements below 90° indicate hydrophilic characteristics,
while values above 90° suggest hydrophobicity [50]. Dielectric constant (DE) measures the
material's ability to polarize under an electric field, with higher DE indicating greater polarity
[51]. Molecular-level indicators like partitioning coefficients between octanol and water (log
Kow) also inform about polarity, with computational models offering reliable estimates [52].

3.5 Evaluating the classification ability of MPs
To assess the classification potential of NR staining, the expression, ∆𝐸 =
√∆𝐻 2 + ∆𝑆 2 + ∆𝑉 2) [53] was used, to calculate the difference between two colors by assessing
variations in their Hue, Saturation, and Value components among the 10 Fenton-oxidized NRstained MPs (Table 2). This ∆E value, facilitates precise evaluation of color dissimilarity, with
fluorescence yielding larger ∆E values more easily distinguishable due to greater color disparity.
The minimal detectable difference in color is a ∆E of 1, with values between 3–6 indicating
noticeable differences in color. A range of 6–10 suggests perceivable color differences that are
noticeable to most people, while values above 10 denote substantial and significant differences
[54], [55]. It's important to note that ∆E is particularly adept at discriminating between colors
rather than matching them.

limitations in clearly distinguishing between PA, PVC, and ABS are believed to stem from the
use of a digital camera to capture fluorescent colors.
To investigate the effects of Fenton-oxidation on the fluorescence of MPs and NOM, ten
different MPs and common NOM sources - derived from chitin (eggshells and fingernails), wood
shavings, and cotton- were examined. Both NR staining with and without pre-treatment were
compared, and the particles were arranged in a clockwise fashion to prevent overlap (refer to
Figure S1). The respective ∆E values between NR staining with no pre-treatment (control) and
Fenton oxidation are summarized in Table S3.
It was observed that Fenton-oxidation resulted in minimal changes to the fluorescence of
NR-stained MPs, with ∆E ranging from 2.5 (PA) to 9.8 (ABS) (refer to Table S3). In contrast,
most NOM exhibited a significant reduction in fluorescence, with chitin (fingernail: ∆E = 38.0,
eggshell: ∆E = 59.0) and wood (∆E = 60.5) experiencing complete quenching of fluorescence.
Cotton showed a lesser reduction (∆E = 11.9), but still exhibited fluorescence after Fenton
oxidation. Notably, cotton’s purple hue (254°) remained distinct from the spectrum of NRstained MPs (ranging from red to green, 352°–87°), allowing it to be easily differentiated from
MPs. Despite some decrease in FI, all studied MPs retained their dominant fluorescent hue, with
only a slight apparent decrease in FI.
The FTIR spectra of the 10 MPs subjected to different treatment were also examined,
including the control group (without Fenton-oxidation or staining), NR-stained MPs (without
Fenton-oxidation), and NR stained MPs subjected to Fenton-oxidation (see Figure S2). Among
the 10 MPs, minor changes were observed in the FTIR spectrum of PVC, specifically a shift in
the carbonyl stretching at 1700 cm-1, while a new peak emerged in PET, corresponding to
hydroxyl stretching at 2900 cm-1, following NR staining and Fenton-oxidation. These oxidation-

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
related peaks suggest that Fenton-oxidation may induce a greater degree of red-shift in certain
polymers. However, despite these changes, there were no significant alterations in the
fluorescence behavior, particularly in the hue of all NR-stained MPs, as indicated by their color
change (∆E <6). This suggests that Fenton-oxidation preserves the fluorescence behavior of MPs
(∆E >10) while reducing the detection of fluorescence from NOM, such as chitin and wood.
Thus, Fenton-oxidation shows promise as a method for minimizing false positives associated
with NR-stained NOM in environmental studies, without resulting in polymer deformation.

3.6 Spectral behavior of NR-stained MPs
The perceived colors of MPs result from the combination of a broad spectrum of
fluorescence wavelengths condensed into a single-color representation. This can lead to spectral
overlap, making it challenging to distinguish MPs under certain lighting conditions—a
phenomenon known as metamerism [56]. To address this, Cokin optical transmission filters
(green, yellow, orange, and red) were used to isolate specific spectral ranges of fluorescing MPs.
These filters function by blocking specific wavelengths while allowing those longer than their
respective cutoff points to pass through. FI measurements across the four optical filters were
obtained and compared side by side to generate a spectral graph, as shown in Figure 5. The FI
observed with the green filter was lower than that of the other filters due to the blocking of
wavelengths between its two transmission peaks. Additionally, variations in particle shape,
thickness, and opacity contributed to larger standard deviations in FI measurements. Notably, PS,
PET, and PC exhibited more intense fluorescence at their edges compared to their interiors.

4. Discussion
This study evaluated eight different carrier solvents to identify the most effective carrier
solvent for NR-staining of MPs. Previous suggested solvents, such as Chl [38], and Hex [37],
caused significant polymer degradation to certain MPs types. Solvent mixtures, such as Ac/ Eth
[47], reduced degradation but resulted in limited FI. In contrast, the proposed method of using
Ac/W mixture (25% (v/v) acetone) successfully mitigated polymer degradation/swelling while
achieving the strongest FI (%) and the most appropriate Stokes shift across all the MPs.
Moreover, this study demonstrated that fluorescence induced by polarity is influenced by the
functional group of the MPs, rather than solely on the solvent polarity, challenging prior claims
by Shim et al. (2016) [37].
In general, the three measures (WCA, DE, and log Kow) act as reasonable approximations for
polarity differences between polymers, distinguishing between highly polar plastics (PA/PET)
and non-polar ones (PE/PP) [57]. However, discrepancies emerge in the rankings compared to
the hues in Figure 4a, as observed with DE, where ABS appears more red-shifted than expected,
and in WCA, where PVC appears less red-shifted than anticipated (refer to Table 1). These
variations could be attributed to the limitations of these polarity measures in quantifying the
specific effects of molecular groups, such as π-π bonding and hydrogen bonding, as they were
originally designed to gauge their impact on specific measures of hydrophobic interactions [49,
50].
Specifically, WCA, intended as a direct measure of surface-specific hydrophobicity with
water, is influenced by surface roughness, chemical composition, and any surface treatments or
contaminants (additives/plasticizers). The substantial composition of 15–50% plasticizers of
PVC [58] can significantly affect its surface wettability, potentially explaining the more non-

Pre-print (Ho & Masura 2025)
polar interpretation via WCA. On the other hand, measures like DE quantify the polarizability of
the material's molecules and their response to an electric field. The presence of chloride atoms
contributes to the overall polarizability of the material, thereby elevating its perceived
measurement of polarity compared to WCA. However, DE, which assesses the changes in
electric polarity within the molecule, exhibits less sensitivity to symmetric aromatic groups
compared to polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl or carbonyl groups) in an electric field [59].
This reduced sensitivity stems from the delocalization of electrons in aromatic rings, thereby
decreasing the magnitude of induced polarity of the molecule [60]. This limitation results in DE's
diminished ability to account for π-π interactions and the perceived red-shift due to the presence
of aromatic groups, potentially overlooking the molecular interaction of plastics like ABS. It is to
be noted that log Kow data for ABS was unavailable, but appears to exhibit similar trends as DE.
Despite the inability to account for π-π interactions, it is believed that DE and log Kow can
serve as a more accurate approximation for polarity than WCA. This is because WCA measures
surface properties, which are sensitive to ambient humidity during measurement [61] and can be
significantly reduced due to biofouling [62] and photo-oxidation [57]. In contrast, DE and log
Kow are designed molecular-level properties, focusing on chemical interactions with NR rather
than superficial surface wettability, making them more suitable for studying NR molecular
interactions. Between the two measures, the creation of a polarity catalog of MPs using log Kow
may be more viable than DE. This is because the contributions of the individual modes of
polarization – electronic, atomic, and orientational – depend on the frequency of the electric field
[59], with lower contributions from orientation and atomic polarization at higher frequencies
[63]. In addition to the frequency used, the surrounding environmental conditions [64], and the
geometry and thickness of the samples can affect the magnitude of DE, leading to discrepancies

between the measured induced charge of the polymers [59], [65], [66]. Hence, caution is required
when selecting the database to quantify and compare DE. On the other hand, log Kow values are
calculated via molecular dynamic simulation from molecular models corrected to surface area,
enabling comparison [52]. With an expansive database of plastics of over 110 plastics featuring
different branching and chemical structures of commercial and laboratory-made polymers [52],
log Kow can be used to compile simulations for better understanding of molecular interactions.
Fenton-oxidation proved to be effective for eliminating the fluorescence of NOM, while
causing minimal changes to the fluorescent hues and chemical properties of the MPs. This
critical step significantly reduces interference of NOM (wood, chitin and cotton) in MPs
detection, thereby enhancing the specificity of NR-based imaging methods. The observed
quenching of NOM fluorescence is likely due to the presence of Fe(II) in the Fenton-oxidation,
as metal ions are known to quench fluorescence [67]. It is hypothesized that the Fenton-oxidation
partially digests NOM, leaving incompletely digested NOM with Fe(II) sorbed onto its surface.
When stained with NR, the Fe(II) on NOM likely inhibits the fluorophore’s ability to fluoresce,
leading to fluorescence quenching. This demonstrates that the common practice of using Fenton
oxidation to digest NOM not only remains compatible with Nile Red staining but also enhances
its selectivity for MPs over NOM, reducing false positives, which is critical for the reliable
classification of MPs in complex environmental samples.
After standardizing the carrier solvent for optimal polarity-induced fluorescence, the
weighted HSV color space was introduced to improve data interpretation. Unlike the
interdependent RGB color model, which requires a formulaic approach to derive a proxy
“polarity index,” [34], [35], [38] the hue-dominant HSV model directly correlates hue shifts (in
degrees) with the perceived Stokes shift. This proposed HSV method allows fluorescence hue

changes to be compared intuitively, bypassing the non-intuitive relationships inherent in the
RGB model. This approach is particularly valuable for environmental MPs, which often exhibit
fluorescence red-shifts over time due to weathering [52], [68]. Such shifts are naturally and
intuitively captured by changes in the hue channel. Moreover, in machine learning
applications—where the quality of input data directly impacts the relationships deduced by the
model—the weighted features and intuitive correlations of the hue channel enhance the model’s
ability to capture meaningful relationships. This reduces dependence on arbitrary proxies, such
as those employed by Meyer et al. (2022) [69], who used decision trees to classify MPs by their
individual R/G/B channels. Consequently, machine learning models leveraging the HSV-based
approach can minimize noise and overfitting, significantly improving their robustness and
applicability to environmental samples and large datasets.
To further enhance MPs differentiation, this study demonstrated the utility of selective
bandpass filters in revealing distinct differences in fluorescence behavior, thereby improving
MPs classification. This approach leverages the correlation between FI and spectra peaks [70],
allowing for the determination of FI across specific wavelengths bands. As shown in Figure 5,
each MPs type exhibited unique spectral profiles, indicating that differentiation based on spectral
shape and intensity is feasible with the use of optical filters. This increased specificity is
particularly beneficial for MPs that were previously difficult to distinguish—such as ABS, PVC,
and PA—which displayed metamerism under unfiltered conditions. By applying optical filters,
the emission behavior of these MPs can be isolated at specific transmission wavelengths,
enabling differentiation based on their material-specific spectral characteristics.
Although higher-order statistical comparisons among multivariate datasets are beyond the
scope of this study, employing statistical models to analyze fluorescence behavior (e.g., in HSV

color space) is anticipated to further enhance the accuracy and specificity of MPs differentiation.
Additionally, since the fluorescence spectra of NR-stained MPs vary with excitation wavelengths
[70], combining multiple excitation sources with selective bandpass filters could pave the way
for developing an advanced multispectral imaging device for precise polymer identification.
These findings suggest that multispectral fluorescence imaging, when integrated with machine
learning, holds significant potential as a standalone method for accurate MPs identification.
As NR staining becomes a cornerstone tool for labeling MPs internationally [24],
standardizing the NR carrier solvent and demonstrating its applicability for polymer
identification are essential for interlaboratory harmonization. When combined with multispectral
fluorescence imaging, this cost-effective method shows significant potential as a standalone
approach for differentiating MPs based on physicochemical properties. However, as plastic
diversity increases, further research is needed to address the effects of environmental weathering,
pigments, and additives on NR fluorescence behavior. Overcoming these challenges will be
critical to establishing NR fluorescence imaging as a reliable and robust method for the accurate
identification of MPs in environmental samples.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study systematically tested eight different carrier solvents for NRstaining of MPs and evaluated their effects on the fluorescence behavior and degradation of ten
polymer types (PP, HDPE, LDPE, PS, EPS, ABS, PC, PVC, PET, PA). Through qualitative
assessment of polymer degradation and analysis of hue evolution across different concentrations
of Ac/W [10–70%], Ac/W [25%] was identified as the optimal solvent for enhancing
fluorescence while preserving polymer integrity. Additionally, the impact of Fenton-oxidation on

the NR-staining method was investigated for both MPs and NOM. The results revealed
significant fluorescence quenching in NOMs (eggshells, fingernails, wood, and cotton) with
minimal changes observed in the NR-stained MPs, showcasing the method's suitability for
environmental sampling applications.
This study also introduced the use of the HSV color spaces for a more appropriate
representation of NR fluorescence and compared different polarity measures (WCA, DE, and
Log Kow) with the perceived Stokes shift of NR-stained plastics. The findings indicate that DE
and Log Kow are more suitable measures of polarity, as they better reflect molecular-level
polarity, unlike WCA, which primarily measures superficial surface wettability. Regarding the
classification of the ten studied MPs, most (PP, HDPE, LDPE, PS, EPS, PC, and PET) were
easily distinguishable (∆E >10), while limited distinguishability was observed between PA,
ABS, and PVC (∆E <10). The use of bandpass filters (green, yellow, orange and red) was
demonstrated to isolate fluorescence behavior across selective wavelength bands, enabling
differentiation based on their material-dependent spectral characteristics. It is suggested that
combining different excitation wavelengths and selective transmission filters, powered by
machine learning could overcome spectral overlaps and mitigate issues such as metamerism.
With these advancements, this approach shows significant potential to establish NR fluorescence
imaging as a standalone method for the accurate identification of MPs in large-scale
environmental monitoring.
