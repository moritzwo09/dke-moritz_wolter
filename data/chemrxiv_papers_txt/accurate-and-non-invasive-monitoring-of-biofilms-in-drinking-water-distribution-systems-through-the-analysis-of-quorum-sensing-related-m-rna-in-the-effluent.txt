Abstract

19

Biofilm growth and dispersion in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) pose risks to water

20

quality and public health. Although monitoring biofilm formation in DWDS is essential for

21

mitigating the risk of waterborne disease infections, current approaches that analyze the properties

22

of the effluent cannot differentiate between planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria. Quorum

23

sensing (QS) systems are microbial communication mechanisms that regulate gene expression

24

based on population density and are known to be more active in biofilm-associated bacteria than

25

in planktonic bacteria. We hypothesize that bacteria dispersed from biofilms in DWDS influence

26

QS-related mRNA levels detected in tap water effluent. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, a

27

common bacterium found in DWDS, as a model organism, we examined the expression of the lasI

28

gene, a key component of the las QS system, responsible for synthesizing QS signaling molecules.

29

Specifically, the transcriptional activity of the lasI gene (i.e., RNA/DNA levels) in P. aeruginosa

30

was systematically analyzed under various growth conditions. Our experiments confirmed that P.

31

aeruginosa exhibits significantly higher lasI mRNA levels in biofilms compared to planktonic

32

states. Additionally, we cultivated P. aeruginosa biofilms in flow channels and demonstrated that

33

lasI mRNA levels in the effluent correlate with biofilm growth conditions within the flow channels.

34

These findings indicate that biofilm growth in DWDS can be investigated non-invasively and

35

accurately by analyzing lasI mRNA in the effluent. This rapid, non-invasive, and accurate biofilm

36

monitoring approach has the potential to enable large-scale inspections and routine monitoring of

37

biofilm growth within DWDS, ultimately improving public health.

1. Introduction

42

Biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) present significant challenges to water

43

quality and safety. These microbial communities can adversely affect the aesthetic properties of

44

water, leading to discoloration, as well as changes in odor and taste (Erdei-Tombor et al., 2024).

45

More critically, biofilms act as reservoirs that protect potentially harmful microorganisms,

46

including opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium, and

47

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Waegenaar et al., 2024). Pathogens associated with biofilm may have

48

enhanced resistance to disinfection, increased virulence potential, and potential for antibiotic

49

resistance. Biofilms are also known to reduce residual disinfectant levels, causing unintended

50

growth of pathogens (Fish et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2018). According to a Centers for Disease

51

Control and Prevention (CDC) study conducted from 2015 to 2020, 28 states reported 214

52

drinking water-associated outbreaks, resulting in 2,140 cases of illness, 563 hospitalizations, and

53

88 deaths. Notably, 87% of these outbreaks were linked to biofilms in drinking water systems

54

(Kunz et al., 2024). These biofilm-associated opportunistic pathogens cost the U.S. an estimated

55

$2.39 billion annually (Healy et al., 2024). Additionally, 172 outbreaks (80%) were associated

56

with water from public water systems, indicating that the source water itself was not the primary

57

issue. This underscores the critical importance of effectively managing drinking water

58

distribution systems to ensure public health protection. Early detection of biofilm formation is

59

essential to enable timely intervention with minimal treatment (Erdei-Tombor et al., 2024).

60

Biofilm monitoring relies on both direct and indirect approaches. Direct approaches

61

involve sampling biofilms by swabbing pipe surfaces or using coupons and microcosm reactors,

62

followed by advanced analysis methods such as confocal laser scanning microscopy, molecular

63

techniques (qPCR and 16S rDNA sequencing), direct cell count or biofilm activity assays

64

(Douterelo et al., 2016; Pick and Fish, 2024; Waller et al., 2018). While direct approaches

65

provide detailed insights into biofilm composition, they are labor-intensive, location-specific,

66

and fail to capture the dynamic nature of biofilm formation. In contrast, indirect approaches

67

involve monitoring water quality parameters in effluent tap water, such as chlorine residuals,

68

turbidity, microbial counts, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurements(Addisie, 2022; Liu

69

et al., 2016), which are indicative of the total bacterial count in the effluent. These methods are

70

simpler, faster, more cost-effective, and applicable to a broader area of the DWDS compared to

71

direct approaches. Additionally, they are non-invasive, allowing for routine monitoring across

72

large distribution systems without disrupting the water supply. These advantages are essential for

73

the early detection of biofilm formation and timely intervention (Liu et al., 2016). However,

74

conventional indirect approaches lack specificity, often failing to differentiate biofilm-associated

75

bacteria from planktonic bacteria, reducing their effectiveness for targeted management.

76

Given the limitations of current biofilm monitoring approaches, identifying an analyte

77

unique to biofilm-associated bacteria could enable accurate detection of biofilms in the effluent.

78

To this end, we focused on population density, as it is one of the significant differences between

79

planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria (Fish and Boxall, 2018; Mikkelsen et al., 2007). For

80

example, Lopes et al., (2018) reported that population density of planktonic bacteria was in the

81

range of 102–105 CFU/mL whereas that of biofilm-associated bacteria ranged between 105 and

82

107 CFU/cm² (i.e., 106 and 109 CFU/mL if the thickness is assumed to be 1 mm; (Neu et al.,

83

2019)), showing several orders of magnitude higher cell density. Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-

84

to-cell communication system that enables bacteria to coordinate gene expression in response to

85

population density (Rutherford and Bassler, 2012). QS plays a crucial role in biofilm formation

86

by regulating bacterial attachment, biofilm maturation, and extracellular matrix production.

87

Specifically, bacteria secrete small signaling molecules, such as N-acyl-homoserine lactones

88

(AHLs), which freely diffuse across cell membranes. As bacterial density increases, AHL

89

concentrations accumulate, triggering the expression of QS-related genes. The las system is one

90

of the well-characterized QS systems and plays a direct role in biofilm formation. Therefore, we

91

hypothesize that las system mRNA in the effluent could serve as a specific biomarker for biofilm

92

growth in DWDS.

93

Here, we introduce a novel approach for biofilm monitoring in DWDS. Our method is

94

based on the analysis of effluent water quality, making it non-invasive. However, this approach

95

is designed to improve accuracy by specifically detecting las mRNA from biofilm-associated

96

bacteria in the effluent. In this study, we selected P. aeruginosa as a model bacterial species and

97

systematically examined las mRNA expression in both planktonic and biofilm-associated

98

bacteria. Our findings demonstrate that las mRNA signals in the effluent predominantly originate

99

from biofilm-associated bacteria. Thus, our study suggests that detecting QS-related mRNA in

100

the effluent provides a rapid, accurate, and non-invasive method for biofilm monitoring in

101

DWDS.

2.1. Experimental design

105

The model bacterial species used was P. aeruginosa PAO1, which is one of the best-studied

106

environmental and opportunistic human pathogens for bacterial biofilm formation, was isolated

107

from industrial wastewater sludge (Noori et al., 2022). We grew the bacteria in three different

108

reactors: a small reactor, a large reactor, and a flow channel. Experiments with the small reactors

109

were conducted to analyze all biofilm-associated bacteria on the reactor surface. For the small

110

reactor experiments, bacteria were first streaked onto LB agar plates and incubated at 37℃

111

overnight. We prepared the LB agar by suspending 40 g of LB agar powder (BP1425-500,

112

Miller-Fisher BioReagents) in 1 liter of purified water (i.e., tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L,

113

sodium chlorine 10 g/L, and agar 15 g/L in the final solution). The mixture was sterilized at

114

121℃ for 15 minutes and cooled down to 40℃, and then distributed as 20 mL onto a 100 mm

115

plate (430167, Corning). The following day, two fresh colonies were selected and diluted in 20

116

mL of LB broth in a 50 mL tube (339653, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The LB broth was prepared

117

by adding 25 g of LB broth powder (BP9723-500, Miller-Fisher BioReagents) to 1 liter of

118

purified water (i.e., tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L, and sodium chlorine 10 g/L in the final

119

solution), followed by sterilization at 121℃ for 15 minutes. The bacteria diluted in the LB broth

120

was distributed as 0.5 mL in 1.5 mL tubes (3448PK, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at

121

37℃ without shaking for various incubation times ranging from 0 to 7 hours (Figs 1 and 2) or 0

122

to 4 days (Fig. 4). We assumed that planktonic bacteria existed in the culture media, while

123

biofilm formed on the inner reactor wall. After incubation, the 0.5 mL of the culture media was

124

gently sampled with a micropipette to minimize biofilm detachment. 140 µL sample was

125

subjected to nucleic acid extraction, which was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini

126

Kit (52906, QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instruction (the final volume of elute was 60

127

µL). After sampling the 0.5 mL of culture media, the empty reactor was gently rinsed with

128

molecular biology-grade water three times to minimize the presence of remaining planktonic

129

bacteria. Then, 560 µL of lysing buffer was added to the reactor to lyse all biofilm-associated

130

bacteria that had formed on the inner reactor wall during the incubation. We conducted a similar

131

experiment with larger reactors to reduce biofilm-associated bacteria dispersed into planktonic

132

bacteria analysis (Fig. 3). For this experiment, fresh colonies grown on agar plates were diluted

133

in 500 mL of LB broth in a 1 L glass bottle and incubated at 37℃ without shaking for various

134

incubation times ranging from 0 to 10 hours.

135

We conducted another experiment in which bacteria were grown in flow channels under

136

flow conditions. Bacteria were diluted in 1 L of LB broth in a 1 L glass bottle. The culture media

137

containing bacteria was fed using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 40 mL/min into fluorinated

138

ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing (Tygon® Versilon™ SE-200, Saint-Gobain) with an inner

139

diameter of 3.175 mm. The tubing was sterilized at 121℃ for 15 minutes before the

140

experimental setup. Bacteria grew in the culture media and on the inner tube wall under flow

141

conditions at room temperature for various incubation times ranging from 18 to 147 hours. After

142

incubation, a 10 cm section of the tubing was cut from the whole tubing. This section was then

143

connected to a reservoir containing tap water, and the tap water was pumped through the tubing

144

at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. We collected 2 L of effluent from the tubing, which was then

145

filtered through a 0.22 µm filter to capture all bacteria in the effluent. After flowing 2 L of tap

146

water, we cut the 10 cm tubing into small pieces so that they can be submerged in 1.68 mL (i.e.,

147

560 µL × 3) of lysing buffer. This allowed for the extraction of nucleic acids from all biofilm-

148

associated bacteria formed inside the tubing. We collected raw tap water samples that had not

149

passed through the tube and analyzed their nucleic acid content as a negative control.

150

Additionally, we analyzed the tap water for pH, ORP, DO, and EC using a meter

151

(HQ2200, HACH) with probes (PHC10101, MTC10101, LDO10101, and CDC40101,

152

respectively, HACH) as well as free chlorine using a spectrophotometer (DR6000, HACH)

153

following the manufacturer’s protocol (80 Chlorine F & PP).

All experiments with the three types of reactors and sample preparations for molecular
analyses, as described in the following section, were conducted in biosafety cabinets (1300

2.2. Molecular analysis

160

Details about our (RT-)dPCR analysis were described following the Minimum Information for

161

publication of Digital PCR Experiments (dMIQE guideline; Table S1). Nucleic acid extracts

162

obtained from the nucleic acid extraction contained both DNA and RNA. The nucleic acid

163

extracts were directly used for DNA analysis using a digital PCR (dPCR) system with the

164

QIAcuity EvaGreen (EG) PCR Kit (250111, QIAGEN). Specifically, the dPCR mixture included

165

2 µL of nucleic acid extract, 0.6 µL of 8 µM forward primer, 0.6 µL of 8 µM reverse primer, 4

166

µL of 3x EvaGreen PCR Master Mix, and 4.8 µL of water. The dPCR mixture was loaded onto

167

an 8.5k 24-well nanoplate with a fixed partition volume of 0.34 nL and analyzed using the

168

QIAcuity One 5plex system (QIAGEN). The thermal cycling protocol consisted of one cycle at

169

95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing at

170

62°C for 15 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 15 seconds, with a final cooling step at 40°C for

171

5 minutes. The dPCR image was captured using the Green channel with an exposure duration of

172

200 ms and a gain of 6.

173

For RNA measurement, DNA was degraded from the nucleic acid extracts using the

174

RNase-Free DNase Set (79254, QIAGEN). Specifically, 10 µL of Buffer RDD, 2.5 µL of DNase

175

I stock solution, 47.5 µL of RNase-free water, and 40 µL of nucleic acid extract were combined

176

in a 200 µL PCR tube. The tubes were then incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes, followed by heat

177

treatment at 70°C for 15 minutes in a PCR thermocycler (Mastercycler x40, Eppendorf) to

178

inactivate the DNase enzyme. For quality control of the DNase assay, we analyzed the nucleic

179

acid extracts that had contained DNA concentrations ranging from 5.1×104 to 4.6×105 gc/µL,

180

for residual DNA after the assay. We confirmed that no residual DNA remained, indicating that

181

RNA measurements originated solely from RNA in the samples (Fig. S1). The DNase-treated

182

samples were subjected to RT-dPCR for RNA quantification using the QIAcuity OneStep

183

Advanced EG Kit (250141, QIAGEN). The RT-dPCR mixture contained 2 µL of nucleic acid

184

extract, 0.3 µL of 30 µM forward primer, 0.3 µL of 30 µM reverse primer, 3 µL of 4x OneStep

185

Advanced EvaGreen PCR Master Mix, 0.12 µL of OneStep Advanced RT Mix, 1 µL of Q-

186

solution, and 5.28 µL of RNase-free water. The RT-dPCR mixtures were loaded onto an 8.5k 24-

187

well nanoplate and analyzed using the QIAcuity One 5plex system (QIAGEN). The thermal

188

cycling protocol for RT-dPCR included incubation at 50°C for 40 minutes, followed by

189

denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes, then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds,

190

annealing and extension at 62°C for 30 seconds, and a final cooling step at 40°C for 5 minutes.

191

The RT-dPCR image was captured using the Green channel with an exposure duration of 200 ms

192

and a gain of 6.

193

All (RT-)dPCR analyses showed a distinct separation between positive and negative

194

partitions (Fig. S2). The threshold for fluorescence intensity was set between 30 and 50 RFU to

195

define positive and negative partitions. Samples for DNA and RNA analyses were diluted in

196

molecular biology-grade water using multiple dilution factors if necessary, and the measurement

197

with the number of positive partitions between 1,000 and 5,000 was selected to determine the

198

final DNA or RNA concentration when available. The limit of detection was 2 gc/µL when the

199

number of positive partitions was 1, at which the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 147.5%. The

200

number of valid partitions was determined automatically with the information of the reference

201

channel. Three biological replicates were conducted for each dataset, and one technical replicate

10

202

was analyzed per biological replicate. The confidence interval (CI) value for all analyses was

203

less than 100%. All (RT-)dPCR analyses were conducted with molecular biology-grade water as

204

a negative control. The highest number of positive partitions in the negative controls was less

205

than 5, and the concentration of the negative control was subtracted from each measurement if a

206

negative control exhibited positive partitions.

207

All samples collected from the experiments were immediately stored at −80°C. Once

208

removed from the freezer, all assays, including nucleic acid extraction, the DNase assay, and

209

(RT-)dPCR, were conducted immediately, and the entire process from sample thawing to loading

210

into the dPCR system took approximately 3 hours. As a result, each sample underwent only one

211

freeze-thaw cycle, minimizing the impact of nucleic acid degradation. Blank nucleic acid

212

extractions were conducted each time a new experimental design was implemented, and all

213

tested negative. We conducted an inhibition test for the nucleic acid extracts, and the impact of

214

inhibitors in the extracts was negligible for (RT-)dPCR analysis (Fig. S3A). All (RT-)dPCR

215

analyses were conducted by two researchers. We confirmed that the coefficient of variation in

216

their RT-dPCR analysis was less than 5% in all cases, and their RT-dPCR results were not

217

significantly different, indicating that the repeatability and reproducibility of RT-dPCR were

218

acceptable (Fig. S3B).

219

Primer information for lasI and lasB genes is provided in Table S2. We confirmed

220

through gel electrophoresis that the primer sets for lasI and lasB synthesized amplicons of the

221

expected sizes and showed no primer dimer formation (Fig. S4). This finding indicates that these

222

primers specifically amplified the target sequences, ensuring that positive (RT-)dPCR partitions

223

did not result from non-specific amplification.

2.3. Statistical analysis

226

DNA and RNA concentrations between reaction times (Figs. 1 and 2) were compared using

227

independent two-sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. Linear regression analysis was

228

conducted to evaluate the goodness of fit using the coefficient of determination (R2) or to assess

229

the statistical significance of variables using the p-value (Figs. 2, 3, and 6). All statistical

230

analyses were conducted using Python 3.10.12 in Google Colab.

3. Results
3.1. Biofilm-associated bacteria transcribe significantly higher levels of lasI mRNA
than planktonic bacteria

235

The model bacterium (P. aeruginosa) was grown in 1.5 mL-sized reactors. We analyzed both

236

DNA and RNA obtained from the bulk solution and the reactor surface (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows

237

DNA obtained from the two compartments to represent planktonic and biofilm-associated

238

bacterial counts, and the sum of the two represents the total bacterial count in the reactor. The

239

red circle in Fig. 1B illustrates that the total bacterial count increased from hour 2 (p<0.05), with

240

bacterial growth reaching saturation at hour 5. More specifically, while planktonic bacteria

241

(green rectangle in Fig. 1B) began to increase at hour 2 (p<0.05), biofilm-associated bacteria

242

(blue triangle in Fig. 1B) grew from hour 3 (p<0.05). This time discrepancy between the two

243

types of bacteria is likely due to the time required for bacteria in the culture medium to attach

244

and initiate biofilm formation. Additionally, although planktonic bacterial growth stopped at

245

hour 3, biofilm-associated bacteria continued to increase until hour 7, when the experiment was

246

completed. These results indicate that while planktonic bacteria were in the stationary phase,

247

biofilm-associated bacteria remained in the exponential growth phase in this experiment.

Fig. 1. (A) An illustration depicting two bacterial states in a reactor. (B) DNA counts obtained
from both the bulk solution and the reactor surface indicate the total bacterial count (red circle),
DNA counts only from the bulk solution represent planktonic bacteria (green rectangle), and
DNA counts only from the reactor surface present biofilm-associated bacteria (blue triangle)
over the incubation period. The target gene was lasI. Three biological replicates are presented for
each incubation time. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-sample t-test (p<0.05,
indicated by *).

258

We analyzed RNA/DNA levels of bacteria in each state (i.e., planktonic bacteria and

259

biofilm-associated bacteria) to understand lasI mRNA transcriptional activity depending on

260

bacterial modes of growth. The blue rectangle in Fig. 2A shows that the RNA/DNA levels of

261

biofilm-associated bacteria significantly increased at hour 2 (p<0.05), prior to a significant

262

increase in biofilm-associated bacterial count (red circle in Fig. 2A) at hour 3 (p<0.05). This

263

result aligns with previous observations that the lasI gene is expressed before the biofilm

264

biomass increases significantly (De Kievit et al., 2001; Duan and Surette, 2007). Additionally,

265

the RNA/DNA levels increased as the biofilm-associated bacterial count increased throughout

266

the experiment.

267
268

However, the RNA/DNA level of planktonic bacteria exhibited different trends from that
of biofilm-associated bacteria (Fig. 2B). First, the increase in RNA/DNA levels of planktonic

269

bacteria did not precede an increase in planktonic bacterial count. Specifically, planktonic

270

bacteria exhibited a significant increase in RNA/DNA levels at hour 2 (p<0.001), and bacterial

271

count also increased at hour 2 (p<0.05). Second, the RNA/DNA levels of planktonic bacteria

272

continued increasing between hours 2 and 7, during which the planktonic bacterial count did not

273

change significantly (p>0.05). As a result, the coefficient of determination from the linear

274

regression analysis for RNA/DNA levels and planktonic bacterial count (R2 = 0.382 in Fig. 2D)

275

was lower than that for biofilm-associated bacteria (R2 = 0.648 in Fig. 2C).

RNA/DNA level across different bacterial growth modes. Linear regression analyses were
conducted (red dashed lines), and the corresponding R² values are presented.

RNA/DNA levels can increase when bacterial density exceeds a certain threshold (Miller

287

and Bassler, 2001; Yan et al., 2021). We hypothesize that the increase in RNA/DNA levels of

288

planktonic bacteria was not due to an increase in planktonic bacterial count but rather the

289

dispersion of biofilm-associated bacteria into the bulk solution, based on the following

290

observations. First, the increase in RNA/DNA levels of planktonic bacteria occurred

291

simultaneously with that of biofilm-associated bacteria at hour 2. Second, the RNA/DNA levels

292

of planktonic bacteria continued increasing until hour 7, during which the biofilm-associated

293

bacterial count increased, whereas the planktonic bacterial count did not. Third, as a result, the

294

RNA/DNA levels of planktonic bacteria showed a greater coefficient of determination with

295

biofilm-associated bacterial count (R² = 0.849, Fig. 2E) than with planktonic bacteria count (R2

296

= 0.382 in Fig. 2D).

297

To further support our hypothesis, we conducted another experiment with large reactors

298

where the dispersion of biofilm-associated bacteria into the bulk solution was significantly

299

reduced. The ratio of volume (cm3) to surface area (cm2) of the small reactor was 0.1 cm, while

300

that of the large reactor was 1.8 cm. Therefore, we assumed that the fraction of bacteria

301

dispersed from the biofilm into the bulk solution, relative to the planktonic bacteria in the bulk

302

solution, was reduced in the large reactor. Fig. 3 shows that the RNA/DNA levels of the bulk

303

solution in large reactors did not increase significantly as planktonic bacterial concentration

304

increased (linear regression; p>0.05). In contrast, the RNA/DNA levels of the bulk solution in

305

small reactors increased rapidly. Notably, the planktonic bacterial concentrations in the large

306

batch experiments encompassed those of the small batch experiments. This finding suggests that

307

the RNA/DNA levels of the bulk solution in the small batch experiments (Fig. 1 and 2) were less

308

likely to have increased due to planktonic bacterial density exceeding a certain threshold but

309

rather due to the dispersion of biofilm-associated bacteria into the bulk solution.

on the data from the large reactors.

316

We conducted another experiment with small reactors for a longer duration. Fig. 4 shows

317

that RNA/DNA levels peaked at hour 7 and plummeted at hour 24 when bacterial growth

318

reached its peak. The diminishing lasI mRNA signal over time has also been reported in other

319

studies (De Kievit et al., 2001). This finding suggests that lasI mRNA does not persist beyond a

320

day once bacterial growth slows down. The degradation of lasI mRNA is likely due to sufficient

321

translation of lasI enzymes, making high mRNA concentrations no longer necessary for bacterial

322

activity.

3.2. lasI mRNA in effluent originates from actively growing biofilm within the

329

tubing through which the water flows

330

We grew bacteria in a tubing with a 3.175 mm diameter under flow conditions at 40 mL/min

331

(Fig. 5A). Bacteria in the culture media grew exponentially until the end of the experiment (blue

332

triangle in Fig. 5B). However, the biofilm-associated bacteria count (red circle in Fig. 5B)

333

reached saturation much earlier, at approximately 44 hours. Unlike in the batch experiment,

334

biofilm growth plateaued earlier, while planktonic bacteria continued to grow. This observation

335

can be explained by an equilibrium between biofilm growth and the dispersion of biofilm-

336

associated bacteria into the bulk solution due to the shear force of liquid flow.

352

the exponential growth phase at approximately 20 hours, the RNA/DNA level in the effluent was

high, around 0.05. However, the RNA/DNA level dropped sharply to about 0.01 as the biofilm-

associated bacterial count reached saturation at approximately 44 hours. This value remained

constant as the biofilm-associated bacterial count stabilized at around 109 gc/tube (regression

analysis; p>0.05). Additionally, we verified that the RNA/DNA level in the effluent from the

357

tubing was proportional to that of biofilm-associated bacteria within the tube, with an R2 value of

358

0.790 (Fig. 6). This finding suggests that the RNA/DNA level in the effluent originated from the

359

dispersion of biofilm-associated bacteria into the effluent.

Note that we analyzed raw tap water that had not passed through the tubing as a control

366

experiment. The water properties, including temperature, pH, ORP, DO, EC, and free chlorine,

367

were 23.3±1.6°C, 8.6 ± 0.2, 235±42 mV, 434±16 μS/cm, 7.8±0.3 mg/L, and 0.09±0.06 mg/L,

368

respectively (n=7). These values align with typical tap water properties (Domoń et al., 2024; Oh

369

et al., 2024). We also analyzed the raw tap water for DNA and RNA using the same lasI primer

370

and (RT-)dPCR conditions. We found that the contribution of tap water to lasI DNA and RNA

371

signals in the effluent from the tubing experiment was below the detection limit. This finding

372

indicates that the RNA/DNA detected in the flow channel experiment originated from the

373

biofilm within the tubing.

4. Discussion
4.1. lasI mRNA is an appropriate biomarker for investigating biofilm formation

377

P. aeruginosa utilizes QS systems to regulate biofilm development, as well as the expression of

378

various virulence factors, in a density-dependent manner (Sakuragi and Kolter, 2007). The las

379

system is one of the well-studied QS systems in Gram-negative bacteria, including P.

380

aeruginosa. Activation of genes related to the las system occurs in a hierarchical manner (Davies

381

et al., 1998). First, the lasI gene synthesizes QS signals (e.g., 3-oxo-C12-HSL), which freely

382

diffuse across the bacterial membrane and enable bacteria to sense their population density. More

383

specifically, the lasR gene encodes the lasR protein, which forms a complex with the QS signals.

384

This complex then induces the expression of virulence factors, including the lasB gene. The lasB

385

gene encodes elastase, a proteolytic enzyme that degrades host extracellular matrix proteins such

386

as elastin, collagen, and fibronectin (Galdino et al., 2019). This degradation process facilitates

387

bacterial attachment to host surfaces and promotes biofilm maturation.

388

During the translation of las-related genes, the lasI gene is autoregulated by the lasR-QS

389

signal complex, meaning that QS signals in the environment accelerate lasI gene expression.

390

Furthermore, the lasI gene is activated at a lower QS signal concentration than other genes (Seed

391

et al., 1995). We also conducted the small reactor experiments for the lasB gene, which is one of

392

the las-related genes, but is not autoregulated and as sensitive to QS signals as lasI gene

393

expression. As a result, the RNA/DNA level of lasI gene was much higher than that of lasB gene

394

(Fig. 2A and Fig. S5). These findings suggest that lasI gene expression is rapid, highly sensitive

395

to bacterial density, and upregulated in the early stages of biofilm formation. Therefore, lasI

396

mRNA serves as a strong indicator of biofilm growth.

4.2. lasI mRNA in effluent indicates biofilm dispersion in drinking water
distribution systems

400

The top layer of a biofilm is where biofilm-associated bacteria actively replicate as the biofilm

401

grows from the surface upward (De Kievit et al., 2001). Additionally, planktonic bacteria in the

402

surrounding fluid accumulate on the top layer of the biofilm. In other words, bacteria in the top

403

layer are relatively newly introduced into the biofilm, either through bacterial reproduction

404

within the biofilm or by the transfer of planktonic bacteria into the biofilm. Bacteria degrade lasI

405

mRNA quickly, as confirmed in Fig. 4 and previous studies (De Kievit et al., 2001), once a

406

sufficient number of proteins has been translated. Thus, lasI mRNA of biofilm-associated

407

bacteria primarily originates from bacteria in the top layer of the biofilm. Other studies also

408

support that QS-related genes are more actively expressed in the top layer of the biofilm (Lidor

409

et al., 2015). For example, Lenz et al., (2008) spatially visualized QS-related genes (phzA1 and

410

aprA) in biofilms and detected strong fluorescence signals derived from QS-related gene

411

expression within 30 µm of the top layer, whereas fluorescence signals significantly weakened in

412

biofilm regions deeper than 30 µm.

413

Our flow channel experiments were conducted when the biofilm, specifically the top

414

layer, was in equilibrium between biofilm dispersion and biofilm growth. Therefore, it is

415

reasonable to assume that the lasI mRNA detected in the effluent originates from bacteria

416

dispersed from the biofilm. From a public health perspective, biofilm dispersion is important

417

information because biofilm detachment into drinking water is directly related to the introduction

418

of pathogens that have grown within the biofilm. For example, L. pneumophila can proliferate

419

within biofilms in drinking water distribution systems and subsequently disperse back into the

21

420

drinking water, making it a major cause of waterborne disease infections in the U.S. (Huang et

421

al., 2020a). Therefore, monitoring RNA/DNA levels in the effluent could serve as a novel

422

approach to assessing the impact of biofilm on public health.

423
424

4.3. Environmental implications

425

Our systematic analysis of lasI gene transcriptional activity (i.e., RNA/DNA levels) supports our

426

hypothesis that the RNA/DNA level in the effluent can represent biofilm growth in DWDS. This

427

novel approach analyzes the effluent from DWDS, making the sampling process rapid and non-

428

invasive. Furthermore, since lasI mRNA is a unique biomarker that distinguishes planktonic and

429

biofilm-associated bacteria, it accurately indicates biofilm dispersion into the drinking water.

430

This rapid, non-invasive, and accurate biofilm monitoring approach will enable large-scale

431

inspections and routine monitoring of biofilm growth within DWDS, ultimately improving

432

public health.

433

Our study has a few limitations. First, our experiment was conducted using a single

434

model bacterial species (P. aeruginosa), whereas actual biofilms in DWDS contain complex

435

microbial communities. Various AHL-based QS systems, such as las, tra, rpa, rhl, cin, and esa,

436

have been reported in bacteria (Kylilis et al., 2018). In addition, other QS mechanisms, including

437

AI-2, PQS, and DSF-based signaling, have also been closely linked to biofilm formation (Passos

438

da Silva et al., 2017; Ryan et al., 2015). As a result, analyzing asI gene alone may not fully

439

represent biofilm growth formed by diverse bacterial species. Therefore, future studies should

440

explore representative QS systems that correlate highly with actual biofilm growth in DWDS.

441

One possible approach is to conduct shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to better

22

442

understand the major QS systems present in the target drinking water and their transcriptional

443

activities.

444

Second, we analyzed bacteria in the bulk solution and on the reactor surface to represent

445

planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria, respectively. Given that the reactor surface was the

446

primary site for biofilm growth, this approach was reasonable. Although our experimental results

447

strongly suggest that the bulk solution contained bacteria dispersed from the biofilm, we did not

448

obtain direct evidence that the RNA/DNA detected in the effluent originated from biofilm-

449

associated bacteria. Thus, future studies should design alternative experimental setups to directly

450

examine the dispersion of biofilm-associated bacteria. One possible approach is to engineer

451

bacteria to fluoresce upon QS-related gene expression and grow them in a microfluidic system.

452

Real-time fluorescence monitoring using microscopy would allow visual tracking of mRNA-

453

producing bacteria in drinking water.

454

Third, our experimental findings suggest that mRNA levels in the effluent are

455

proportional to bacterial dispersion from the biofilm. Biofilm dispersion is influenced by various

456

factors, including flow rate, which is directly related to the shear force applied to biofilm

457

detachment, and water chemistry, which affects biofilm physical properties such as porosity and

458

elasticity (Clark et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023a, 2023b, 2020b; Shi et al., 2022). Thus, future

459

studies should investigate RNA/DNA levels in the effluent from DWDS under diverse

460

environmental conditions to better understand these relationships.

461
462

5. Conclusions

463

This study presents a rapid, non-invasive, and accurate approach for monitoring biofilm growth

464

in DWDS by analyzing the transcriptional activity of QS-related genes (i.e., RNA/DNA levels)

23

465

in the effluent. Our findings demonstrate that lasI-like QS synthase mRNA can serve as a

466

reliable biomarker specifically associated with biofilm growth and its dispersion from DWDS.

467

Given the critical role of biofilms in harboring opportunistic pathogens, implementing this

468

mRNA-based biofilm monitoring strategy could significantly improve public health by providing

469

real-time insights into biofilm dynamics and enabling large-scale DWDS monitoring without

470

disrupting the water supply.
