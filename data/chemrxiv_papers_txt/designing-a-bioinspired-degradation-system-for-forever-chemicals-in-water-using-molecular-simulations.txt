Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often termed “forever chemicals”, are resistant to natural
biodegradation processes. PFAS poses many health risks and environmental challenges and is correlated
with causing certain types of cancer, immune system disorders, and pollution. As a result, many
approaches have been attempted to degrade PFAS and more similar substances but have been
inefficient in degradation because of high cost, producing toxic byproducts, and high energy intensity. This
research proposes a method of utilizing the fatty acid photodecarboxylase (5NCC), a photo enzyme that
requires light to catalyze its reactions obtained from the Protein Data Bank, to degrade PFAS. Since the
molecular characteristics of PFAS are similar to the protein’s natural ligand, palmitic acid (PLM), we
suggest that PFAS is also degradable by the fatty acid photodecarboxylase (5NCC) protein. We produced
the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), the lowest occupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), and
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the 5NCC enzyme with a carboxylate PFAS ligand to assess
binding affinity and examine if it can emulate the PLM ligand. These experimentations investigates the
efficiency of carboxylate versions of a novel PFAS degradation system and represents a step forward in
achieving sustainable solutions for the PFAS contamination global issue.

Introduction
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are anthropogenic substances containing multiple
Carbon-Fluorine bonds with a hydrophobic polar headgroup and tail. PFAS are a diverse group of
synthetic chemicals that have been produced for over 90 years and can be grouped into 2 categories:
1

short-chain and long-chain. PFAS are highly nondegradable substances that serve in a variety of sectors
like pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, electronics, and even in environmental services for water
1−3

treatment because of their strong C-F bonds which gives them thermal and chemical stability.

However, the same unique properties of PFAS also contribute to bio-accumulation and are toxic
4

to both humans and the environment. It has persistent global use because of its practical applications but
as a result, PFAS contamination is pervasive and affects drinking water, agriculture, and livestock around
4−5

the world. According to some scientific studies, exposure to certain levels of PFAS can lead to:
increased rates of prostate, kidney, and testicular cancers, weakened immune system, increased

cholesterol and obesity, reproductive effects, developmental effects in children, and interference with the
3,6,7

human body’s natural hormones.

To understand degradation methods of PFAS, we first must understand its physical properties
and chemical composition to understand why certain methods are efficient or inefficient. Structurally,
PFAS has a carbon chain, carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds, a functional group, and an amphiphilic structure
8,9

. Most notably, the hazardous characteristics of PFAS are mainly due to its strong C-F bonds. The strong
bonds are caused by properties such as high electronegativity and low polarizability of fluorine which
leads to weak intermolecular interactions. This contributes to their mutually hydro- and lipophobic
10

(stain-resistant) and surfactant properties and make them thermally and chemically stable. Because of
such unique amphiphilic properties, this makes PFAS more capable of bioaccumulation and sorption,
11−12

thereby posing toxicity to organisms.

The carbon chain is a backbone of 2 to 13+ carbon atoms that can be grouped into short and
longer carbon chains connecting the “tail” of the molecule and the “head of the molecules, which is a
charged function group. It is also known that longer chains, water-attracting and polar, are more
bioaccumulative and have a stronger affinity for solid-phase organic carbon while shorter chains,
water-repelling and nonpolar, are more mobile in water.
The functional groups are commonly carboxyl groups and are attached at one end of the chain.
PFAS with carboxylic acid or sulfonamide functional groups have surfactant-like properties because of its
amphiphilic structure. This makes the structure more complex than traditional surfactants where PFAS are
able to accumulate at fluid-fluid interfaces and interact with both polar and nonpolar regions within living
organisms. Some PFAS functional groups (ionic PFAS) can dissociate into anions or cations in aqueous
8

solution under appropriate pH conditions.

Traditional methods have been used to degrade PFAS: thermal destruction, chemical redox, or
13

electrochemical oxidation. However, there are many drawbacks because these methods are chain
length-specific and functional group-specific which leads to inefficacy in combating the wide range of
PFAS present in the environment. There is also concern over high energy costs, the ability to perform
14

these methods on a larger scale, and the incomplete degradation creating short-chain PFAS.

Research in PFAS degradation using computational methods poses a more reliable alternative
solution than traditional methods because of cost and time efficiency. Computational chemistry can be
used to enhance these processes where it is involved in selecting and optimizing absorbents that
15

efficiently remove PFAS from contaminated environments.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can
16

enhance a deeper understanding of contaminant-mineral interactions and the energetics of adsorption.

Protein engineering like De novo and in silico design as a whole also hold potential in advancing
research in PFAS degradation. De novo design utilizes prior molecular structures to create novel molecules
17−18

or proteins to have a strong binding affinity to a specific protein target.
This allows for exploration of
new structures beyond naturally-occuring molecular structures which can lead to improved therapeutics
18−19

and functions.

In silico protein design modifies existing protein structures to achieve new functions,
20

properties, and to improve binding affinity. Protein modification can range from minor adjustments of an
existing protein or a substantial redesign to make a novel structure. For instance, an approach is rational
mutagenesis where specific residues, amino acids, or active sites are mutated to have a different function
21

.

The drawbacks of protein engineering as there are many amino acid sequences which makes it
difficult to explore specific optimal solutions and experimental validation is required in order to evaluate

22−23

the new structure and its functionality.
However, de novo and in silico still offer several advantages
because enzymes can be tested virtually and replicated many times for more results without the risk of
PFAS exposure making it cost effective, safe, and rapid.
Combining de novo design and in silico design with computational tools can provide insights that
we are otherwise not able to have with traditional de novo and in silico protein design alone.
Computational de novo and in silico protein design have allowed for rational, physics-based design of
protein structures and sequences which enables the creation of novel protein folds and functions not
found in nature. Moreover, computational methods can enhance structural precision and improve
functional design which leads to rapid iteration that can validify experimental testing and optimization.
Some computational protein engineering methods are coarse-grained molecular dynamic (MD)
simulations, quantum mechanical methods like Density Function Theory (DFT), and machine learning
approaches. Computational approaches examine proteins more extensively compared to experimental
17

methods alone and allows for more targeted and efficient design processes.

Computational means such as the usage and study of structures from the Protein Data Bank
17

have contributed to the success of protein design applications. The usage of computational protein
design have led to advancements like the observation of the new alpha-beta protein which had not been
17

previously observed in nature.

This molecule was assembled from fragments from the Protein Data
17

Bank after analysis of the natural protein structure which led to the creation of its artificial structure.
Furthermore, there have been more recent successes in computational protein designs such as novel
folds, novel enzymes, vaccines, antibodies, novel protein assemblies, ligand-binding proteins, and
24

membrane proteins.

Furthermore, Enzymes have been developed and optimized because of
17

computational methods and hold a promise of continuing to enhance protein design .

In the context of PFAS degradation, de novo and in silico protein design are approaches that
make up protein engineering and has promising applications in developing enzymes that can degrade
PFAS as they can aim to identify and optimize proteins that are capable of breaking down PFAS through
advanced computational modeling and molecular design.
Another prior research performed MD simulations on the Delftia acidovorans bacterium, which
were collected samples from PFAS-contaminated sites and identified as a promising microorganism
25

capable of degrading PFAS. The enzymes produced by D. acidovorans, dehalogenases, were
engineered for expression in Escherichia coli to enable rapid production and purification and found
25

potential for enzymatic defluorination of PFOA/S. This study visually identified potential pockets and
performed binding affinity modeling with a docking software called MCule-1CD and showed that PFAS
was bounded to the dehalogenases. When cultured with PFOA during experimentation, D. acidovorans
have shown an increase in Fluoride ion release in PFOA. However, this research also poses limitations.
The models of some of these halogenases, DeHa I and II, were based on homology rather than direct
structural data which could impact the reliability of binding studies and functional predictions as it lacks
published crystal structures for DeHa I and II.
This past research introduced the use of bacterial enzymes as a potential solution in degrading
PFAS but the drawbacks is the accuracy and precision when discovering enzymes with strong bind
affinity to PFAS ligands as the 3D structures of dehalogenases enzymes used are uncertain. Therefore, a
better alternative solution is to continue with bacterial enzymes but utilize structures that are more
established and validated.
We propose the usage of the 5NCC protein, a structure of fatty acid Photodecarboxylase in
complex with Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) and Palmitic Acid (PLM) from the Protein Data Bank,
which provides the detailed 3D structures of the enzyme classified as an oxidoreductase. This enzyme is

derived from the green alga Chlorella variabilis and plays a pivotal role hydrocarbon production and the
photodecarboxylation of fatty acids—a process that involves the removal of a carboxyl group from fatty
26

acids using light energy.

In this current study, we propose that the fatty acid photodecarboxylase enzyme is able to
remediate and/or degrade PFAS because of its ability to decarboxylate fatty acids, synthesize
hydrocarbons from carboxylic acids, and use light to do these processes. We performed electronic
structure experimentation, molecular dynamics simulations, and utilized RMSD and RMSF calculations to
investigate the practicality of the 5NCC protein to degrade PFAS. By proposing a novel method of
degradation, this current study holds potential to advance current research in PFAS capturing methods
and help mitigate the spread and contamination of PFAS (carboxylate form) through an eco-friendly and
green method.

Methods

We generated and analyzed the molecular orbitals of fatty acid carboxylates using the PySCF
program, an open-source quantum chemistry library intended for electronic structure calculations. We
installed many Python packages: RDKit for molecular structure editing, matplotlib and seaborn for
plotting, numpy and pandas for numerical and data analysis, PySCF and py3Dmol for molecular
27,28,29

visualization, and ForteCubeView for orbital plotting.
The molecular orbitals of four molecules were
created and studied using RDKIT: two PFAS molecules, a carboxylic and carboxylate type, two fatty
acids, a carboxylic type Palmitic Acid (PLM) and a carboxylate type of polylactic acid (PLA). Hartree-Fock
(HF) and post-HF algorithms were also successfully executed with PySCF. After the libraries and
packages were imported, the 2D structures of the molecules were generated from the Smiles strings,a
format used to represent chemical structures, using the Chem.MolFromSmiles() function. For instance,
the function used Palmitic Acid’s (PLM) SMILES string “CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)O”, to produce its
2D structure.
The 3D structures were also obtained and prepared with many techniques. The xyz coordinates
of the structure were collected using a self-defined function get_xyz and extracted by the
Chem.MolToXYZBlock(mol). The molecules were embedded with Hydrogen atoms to ensure proper
valence and bonding configurations and were optimized by the MMFF force field if necessary. Then, the
3D structure was visualized using the py3Dmol.view() function with inputs of a height and width of 300 (in
pixels), a stick representation, and a sphere with a scale of 0.3.
After producing the 3D structures, the function run_calculation() calculates the electronic structure
and other molecular properties of the molecule. The “sto-3g” dataset, used to approximate molecular
orbitals, was utilized in the function. The command gto.M(...) used the Gaussian Type Orbital (GTO)
basis sets to initialize the molecule, the unit of the atomic coordinates were set in Angstroms, molecular
symmetry were enabled, and the mol.build() function built the molecules with the given parameters.
Afterwards, the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) calculation was run on the molecule, calculating the
ground state energy of the molecule, assuming that all electrons are paired.The result of the RHF, which
contained the molecular orbital coefficients and energy, and molecule was returned.
The molecular orbital (MO) energy levels and their occupancies were organized by a data table
produced by the Pandas pd.DataFrame(...) for data analysis with inputs of Mf.mo_energy and mf.mo_occ.
Mf.mo_energy contained the energy levels of the molecular orbitals calculated from Hartree-Fock and the
mf.mo_occ command contained the occupancies of molecular orbitals running from 0-2, 0 being empty
orbitals, 1 being partially occupied orbitals, and 2 being fully occupied orbitals. The canonical orbitals,
directly computed by the HF calculation, the intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs), intrinsic bonding orbitals

(IBOs) and localized intrinsic valence virtual orbitals (LIVVOs) were collected. The Highest Occupied
Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) from the molecular
orbital (MO) data in the mean-field object (mf) is identified. Files were produced and plotted to visualize
all different types of molecular orbitals and displayed regions where 85% of the total electron density or
orbital probability is contained.
The preparation process for the molecular dynamics simulations included importing/installing
condacolab, RDKIT, OpenMM Force Fields, numpy, MDTraj, pdbfixer, OpenMM, OpenFF Toolkit, and
GAFF Template Generator for Force Field (GAFF). The pdb file of the 5NCC protein and its ligand were
obtained from the Protein Data Bank.
A function was used from the pdbfixer library to prepare the protein. This addressed any missing
residues or atoms where it was identified. Nonstandard residues were replaced by standard ones and
added any missing atom, and removed any heteroatoms from the protein structure. It also managed the
protonation state based on the pH level where any missing hydrogen atoms were added to meet the
specified pH level. The ligands were individually handled by splitting into separate components based on
residues, hydrogen atoms were removed and added to prepare for protonation, and bond orders were
assigned to the ligand based on a reference molecule template. A visual comparison depicting the ligand
before and after were produced for analysis and ensuring the success of the preparation. The 5NCCA
protein’s other natural ligand, FAD, was also produced from its smiles string.
The RDKIT molecule was converted to an OpenFF molecule then into a topology in order to be
used in OpenMM. The protein and ligands were merged along with the FAD ligand into a single topology
and atomic positions suitable for a simulation . The protein force field used was "amber14-all.xml" and the
solvent force field was "amber14/tip3pfb.xml". Solvent molecules were added to the system with an ionic
strength of 0.15 M and a 1 nanometer buffer zone was added to ensure the presence of solvents around
the system. The solvation box was the TIP3 water model.
Setting up the simulation, the target temperature for the simulation was 300 K and the friction
coefficient (γ) was 1 ps⁻¹, and the time step for the integration was 2 fs. The simulation system undergoes
energy minimization and then stores a topology and atomic positions into a PDB file. The simulation ran in
two different ways. If it was on google colab, the simulation ran for 100 picoseconds (ps), the trajectory
file was written every 10 picoseconds(ps), and the process was logged every 5 picoseconds (ps). If run
locally, the simulation ran for 20 femtoseconds (fs), trajectory file writing every step (2 fs), progress being
logged every step 2 femtoseconds, with a temperature of 300 Kelvin (K). The resulting simulation was
stored in a pdb and trajectory file titled "topology.pdb" and “trajectory.xtc” in the XTC format and titled,
trajectory.xtc.
After molecular simulations were complete, the trajectory and topology files of the 2 cases, the
PFAS ligand bind with the enzyme and the PLM ligand bind with the enzyme, were imputed into a python
script to compute the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) calculations of the ligand and backbone of
the protein.The script utilized the MDTraj library to perform trajectory analysis. The analysis was
performed after energy minimization and equilibration to observe the structural stability of both ligands
under the binding of the enzymes and assess if both enzymes shared similar dynamic characteristics. 4
graphs were produced, 2 for the PLM ligand and 2 for the PFAS ligand.

Results and Discussion

Figure 1: This is a visualization of the fatty acid photodecarboxylate enzyme (green) in its
natural state collected from the Protein Data Bank and obtained by being expressed in E. coli .26
Along with the enzyme, it also depicts its ligands PLM (blue) and FAD (red). This enzyme
converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons in response to blue light initiated by the light-capturing
flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor with a quantum yield >80%. The protein’s
hydrocarbon production activity was optimum around pH 8.5 and decreased sharply when
temperature rose above 35°C30
We first evaluated the structure of the PLM ligand to the PFAS ligand to see if there are any
structural similarities between PFAS and PLM and can thus consider PFAS as potentially degradable by
the 5NCC enzyme. Figure 2 shows Palmitic acid having 16-carbon aliphatic chain and a carboxylate
anion (-COO⁻) group at one end. PFAS was also shown to have 16-carbon aliphatic chain with 33
Fluorine atoms and a carboxylate anion (-COO⁻) group at one end. As illustrated, both PFAS and PLM
showed structural similarities in carbon chain and a hydrophobic tail end which suggests that there may
be similar chemical reactivity and binding affinity, assuming that the enzyme can’t differentiate between
the two ligands. A significant difference is that PLM consists of a hydrocarbon backbone and is not
entirely fluorinated compared to carbon-fluorine bonds and their more fluorinated backbone which
accounts for how PFAS is less biodegradable than PLM.

comparable reactivity. Although the LUMO values of carboxylate PFAS (10.48) and PLM (16.67) have a
bigger gap, it’s relatively still comparable with a gap of 6.19 eV.

Figure 6 shows the 39 detected residues of both PFAS and PLM. When obtaining which residue
reacted with the ligands, the PFAS ligand was directly substituted in for PLM and we observed that it was
the same residue bonded to PLM, also binded with PFAS. This indicates that they share similar binding
modes within the enzyme’s active site, also implying that the positive outcome of the enzyme potentially
can’t differentiate between the ligands because of structural similarity. Furthermore, this implies that the
enzyme can also theoretically catalyze the same reaction as it does with PLM. This can also be supported
by the diverse data (39 residues total) of residues that bind with these ligands of different interaction
types, hydrophobic, polar (uncharged), and polar (charged), suggesting the idea that the enzyme’s active
site can accommodate various substrates. Most residues were hydrophobic (21 residues) which can
provide a stable environment for PFAS to bind with the enzyme since a hydrophobic core might be
formed. Moreover, with the presence of charged polar amino acids, it can lead to further stabilization of
PFAS with the enzyme if the ligand has any positive charges or dipole moments. Essentially, the
presence of ionic amino acids like Arginine (ARG) (2 residues total), highly reactive to negative-charged

groups, and Glutamate (GLU), interacts with positive-charged sites, in the binding site hints that it’s
involved in the catalytic activity by promoting tight substrate binding.

PLM and PFAS also shared similar dynamics characteristics as the PFAS ligand stayed stable
and alike to PLM and certain times in the simulation. Shown by the RMSD graphs in figures 11 and 12,
the RMSD calculations of both system’s ligands were similar up to approximately 20 picoseconds (ps)
with values around 0.58 Angstroms for PFAS and 1.12 Angstroms for PLM . More precisely, the RMSD
values of the backbone of both systems had slight deviations throughout the simulation but at 100
picoseconds (ps), the values were around 1.2 Anstrom for PFAS and 1.19 for PLM. This infers that the
5NCC enzyme can accommodate PFAS just like PLM for early stages during the simulation for the
ligands and the more accurate RMSD values of PFAS to PLM shows that it experiences conformational

changes to PLM. Nonetheless, the general RMSD calculations suggest similar dynamics in early stages
and backbone.
There poses a limitation in analyzing structural characteristics of both molecules as our
experimentation and findings can’t accurately conclude that PFAS is degradable by the enzyme solely
based on structural similarities. Yet theoretically, the 5NCC protein can cross-react with PFAS, particularly
long-chain ones, since PLM and PFAS have similar chain length, hydrophobicity, and functional groups.
Our experimentation of only observing and considering close-distant residues to the enzyme lacks
considering other realistic factors and making generalizations that can hinder findings. During
experimentation, we only detected residues that were within 5 Angstroms of the ligand. By doing this,
farther distanced residues that can potentially influence the interaction of the ligand are not considered.
Classifying residues as either hydrophobic or polar and observing their charges only can also lead to a
limitation in predicting behavior of real-world enzyme-ligand systems.The purpose of this experimentation
was to make a simple conclusion on if PFAS are dynamically similar to PLM and we discovered that the
enzyme can allow for various substrates like PFAS to bind with it by certain residues that enhances the
binding strength and excludes any disfavorable interactions. For the molecular orbital calculations, there
was a limited number of molecular orbitals, only HOMO and LUMO. This causes our findings to not other
relevant electronic properties that could influence reactivity and interactions with the enzyme. The ligand
RMSD calculations can be interpreted to show a slight falter in the dynamic similarity between PFAS and
PLM and there’s a limited scope of analysis since only the ligands and backbones values were calculated.

Conclusion
This study investigated the structural, electronic, and dynamic characteristics of the carboxylate
version of PFAS, binded with the 5NCC protein that was obtained from the Protein Data Bank, to the
palmitic acid (PLM) ligand to assess the capability of the 5NCC enzyme degrading per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Our findings illustrated significant structural similarities between
PFAS and PLM - the same 16 carbon chain and carboxylate anion group - which showed that in the
beginning of our experimentation, PFAS could have equivalent chemical reactivity and binding affinity.
With the analysis of close-distant binding residues, we noticed a high amount of hydrophobic residues
and ionic residues like Arginine (ARG) and Glutamate (GLU) that stabilize the ligand-enzyme system,
which further supported that PFAS could be tightly bound with the enzyme. The molecular orbital
comparisons also showed similar electronic reactivities by the small gap of 0.34 eV between the HOMO
values of the molecules’ carboxylate version. More notably, the RMSD calculations also strengthened our
hypothesis of similar dynamics. However, this study also comes with limitations as the generalization of
certain experimentations could affect findings by overlooking critical interactions that affect binding
behavior and not accounting fully for dynamic characteristics of realistic enzyme-ligand binding. Overall,
the 5NCC protein’s structural and chemical flexibility necessary to interact with PFAS reinforces the
proposition that the protein has the capabilities to degrade PFAS. The barrier that prevents using this idea
in realistic applications is the challenge in designing the carboxylate version of PFAS structure in order for
it to fit within the protein and bind. Yet ultimately, this understanding contributes towards further research
as scientists are able to explore this new method and discover potential enzymatic pathways of
bioremediation for PFAS.
