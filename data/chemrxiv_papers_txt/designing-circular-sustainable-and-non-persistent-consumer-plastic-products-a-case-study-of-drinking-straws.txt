ABSTRACT

17
18

Drinking straws present a simple form factor for evaluating material design strategies taken by

19

manufacturers to achieve circular, sustainable, and non-persistent products in response to global

20

restrictions and consumer sentiment. We investigated thirteen on-the-market drinking straws of

21

varying formulations, characterizing their physical, chemical, and marine biodegradation

22

properties. These data informed sustainability metrics used for evaluating the effectiveness and

23

tradeoffs of design strategies, ultimately arriving at four key conclusions. First, diverting

24

anthropogenic methane as a renewable feedstock to make polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)

25

resulted in the only straw with a net-negative global warming potential. Second, adding biogenic

26

fillers to conventional polymers (e.g., polypropylene) to minimize plastic usage is unlikely to

27

produce substantial environmental benefits compared to using alternative polymers. Third, many

28

marketing claims about circularity, sustainability, and persistence were unsupported, likely

29

magnifying the mismanagement and environmental impacts of these products. Fourth, improper

30

disposal of compostable straws in landfills could increase the global warming potential of the item

31

by up to six times and offset numerous advantages afforded by biodegradable materials, thereby

32

warranting greater investment in waste management infrastructure. The analysis of design

33

strategies and their tradeoffs provided herein should be applied broadly when developing and

34

adopting future consumer products.

INTRODUCTION

42
43

Drinking straws are polarizing, frequently littered, and pervasive single-use products. Upwards of

44

50 billion drinking straws are used annually in the U.S.,1 and because these products are

45

improperly disposed of (mismanaged), they contribute to ~5% of coastal plastic debris globally.2

46

To curb their deleterious impacts as pollution, regulations have targeted drinking straws globally

47

from the municipal to federal levels, banning products perceived as persistent in the environment.

48

In response to these restrictions and consumer sentiment, a market for more sustainable and less

49

persistent drinking straws emerged. In recent years, the market has ballooned to include dozens

50

of brands (Table S1) claiming to be less impactful to the environment. Such claims are predicated

51

on the switch to plastic formulations using different polymers, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates

52

(PHAs), and additives, such as organic and inorganic fillers.

53
54

Environmentally conscious consumers, businesses, and policymakers face challenges navigating

55

advertising for these new drinking straws.3 The details provided by brands and manufacturers

56

range from cryptic and vacuous marketing language to informative and readily accessible

57

messaging. This fact is belabored by the myriad certifications and labels on product packaging

58

that require a detailed understanding of their test methods to fully appreciate the nuances and

59

reasonable claims that can be drawn from them. Two of the most frequently used labels are from

60

certifiers Tüv Austria and the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI),4,5 which provide certificates

61

for home and industrial compostability. These third parties certify polymer resins and products

62

according to compostability standards (e.g., ASTM 64006), as well as their additional scrutiny.

63

Other labels reflect claims of feedstock renewability and global warming potential (GWP). The

64

emphasis on certification is a legal matter (e.g., under the U.S. Federal Trade Commission Act7).

65

Certification is necessary for businesses to substantiate any environmental marketing claims,

66

particularly those related to degradability.

67
68

Addressing persistence has often been met by designing straws for degradation in engineered

69

environments, such as compost. This attribute is necessary for circular material schemes

70

following a managed life cycle. Yet, the safeguard solution to the pollution of frequently

71

mismanaged items is to imbue the items with inherent degradability in all environments:

72

engineered and natural.8 This feature has been advocated as one of six key interventions for

73

mitigating the potential impacts of plastic pollution by embracing the principles of green chemistry

74

and engineering in material and product design.9–11

75
76

While many drinking straws are certified as compostable and claim biodegradability, few present

77

evidence for their degradation in the marine environment, where these items are ubiquitous.12

78

Many compostable polymers feature incongruent degradation behavior with natural environments

79

(e.g., polylactic acid, PLA).13–15 Additionally, while certificates for marine biodegradability exist, the

80

methods for evaluating marine degradation do not represent natural conditions because of well-

81

recognized bottle effects.13 In short, these methods provide evidence that marine microbes can

82

biodegrade a material, but they are incapable of estimating lifetimes in natural settings. Having

83

intrinsic biodegradability in the marine environment is necessary for plastic products, such as

84

drinking straws, that frequently leak into the ocean.8

85
86

Plastic pollution is not the only environmental impact drinking straw manufacturers have aimed to

87

avoid and reduce by switching to alternative plastic formulations. Impacts across the entire life

88

cycle are being addressed to varying extents. The approaches manufacturers take to reduce the

89

life cycle environmental impacts of drinking straws represent a microcosm of the broader

90

landscape of approaches tried by the plastics industry to address the impacts of feedstock and

91

end-of-life (EoL) disposal. Thus, drinking straws present a simple form factor (a hollow cylinder)

92

invariant across brands for quantifying the environmental impacts of different commercially-viable

93

material design strategies applied at scale for achieving sustainable plastic products.

94
95

Herein, drinking straws of varying formulations from different manufacturers were investigated for

96

their environmental impacts. These straws encompass products manufactured by startups to

97

multinational corporations being adopted by local stores and international brands alike. The

98

straws were evaluated for their physical, chemical, and realistic marine biodegradation properties

99

(i.e., lifetimes and microbial community composition), which informed sustainability metrics

100

related to renewability, material efficiency, resource utilization, GWP, and environmental

101

persistence. This analysis identified successful design strategies for sustainability and circularity,

102

as well as their tradeoffs that should be applied broadly in designing future plastic products.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

105
106

Materials

107
108

The drinking straws used in this study included three PHA-based straws produced by Aircarbon,

109

LifeMade, and Pura Vida Bioplastic, one calcium carbonate-filled straw made with an undisclosed

110

resin produced by Strawfish, one agave bagasse-filled straw made with an undisclosed resin and

111

produced by the Sustainable Agave Company, and two straws made from proprietary or

112

undisclosed resins produced by Matter and LOLIWARE. An uncoated paper straw and a

113

conventional polypropylene (PP) straw were used as representative biodegrading (positive

114

control) and non-biodegrading (negative control) straws, respectively. The Aircarbon, LifeMade,

115

and Pura Vida Bioplastic straws were labeled PHA1, PHA2, and PHA3. The Strawfish and

116

Sustainable Agave Company straws were labeled “CaCO 3 filled Resin” and “Agave Bagasse filled

117

Resin”. The Matter and LOLIWARE straws were labeled Resin 1 and Resin 2. The positive and

118

negative control straws were labeled Paper and PP. The straws were characterized to have

119

sufficient information for comparison and calculating sustainability metrics (Supporting

120

Information). Details (Section S1) and findings (Table S2) on four additional drinking straws

121

previously investigated by our group were included in the analyses for broader coverage of the

122

design space.14 These straws include a cellulose diacetate (CDA) straw provided by Eastman,

123

two PHA straws produced by Phade and Beyond Green (labeled PHA 4 and PHA 5, respectively),

124

and a PLA straw produced by Plasticless (labeled PLA).

125
126

Evaluation of marine biodegradation

127
128

The biodegradation of drinking straws under coastal marine conditions was assessed by three

129

orthogonal and previously reported methods: short-term seawater incubations measuring

130

microbial respiration,16,17 long-term incubations in a continuous flow natural seawater mesocosm

131

monitoring mass loss,14–16,18–20 and analysis of microbial community composition.14,18 The specific

132

details of each approach are provided in the Supporting Information, Tables S3-S4, and

133

Figures S1-S6.

134
135

Sustainability metrics

136
137

Several sustainability metrics were calculated, including renewability, material efficiency,

138

embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, embodied water usage, projected environmental

139

lifetime in the marine environment, and managed EoL GWP. Data were collated from literature

140

sources for material properties not measured or calculated in this study (Table S5). The specific

141

embodied GHG emissions for the biogenic filler materials (CaCO3 and agave bagasse) were

142

assumed to be negligible, i.e., they were assumed to be 100% sequestering. Material efficiency

143

was taken as the average mass of each straw. Embodied GHG emissions and embodied water

144

usage were calculated as the product of the mass of each straw and the specific embodied GHG

145

emissions and the specific water usage for its polymer and filler, respectively. Renewability was

146

calculated as the fraction of renewable material used in each straw. Managed EoL GWPs were

147

calculated for compost and landfill environments. For calculations, the Agave Bagasse filled Resin

148

was assumed to be 25% agave bagasse. The Resin 1 straw was assumed to be a commercial

149

blend of PLA and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), consisting of 45% PLA and 55%

150

PBAT. PBAT was assumed to be fossil-based.21,22 Metrics were not calculated for the Resin 2

151

straw because of a lack of reliable data for this material and its exact composition.

152
153

Embodied GHG potential of biogenic materials. The embodied GHG potential of the biogenic

154

materials used in the straws was estimated, assuming all the C associated with the material

155

removed atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Embodied GHG potential was calculated according

156

to Equation 1, where 𝜒𝐶 is the weight percent of C in the material (kg C/kg material),

157

stoichiometric ratio of CO2 converted to carbon in the biogenic material (assumed 1), 𝑤𝐶 is the

158

molar mass of carbon (12 g/mol), and 𝑤𝐶𝑂2 is the molar mass of CO2 (44 g/mol).

The values of 𝜒𝐶 were retrieved from reported values in the peer-reviewed literature. Calcium

carbonate is 12 wt% C, and agave bagasse has been reported to be 41.25 wt% C.23

165

EoL GWP. The EoL GWP of a biodegradable material was estimated for landfill and composting

166

environments. Only contributions from methane (CH4) and CO2 were included in the estimates.

167

The Buswell equation24 was used for landfill conditions to estimate the stoichiometric ratios for

168

converting the biodegradable material to CH4 and CO2. For composting conditions (aerobic

169

conditions), all the carbon in the material was assumed to be converted to CO 2. The GHG potential

170

was calculated as the sum of the contributions from CH4 and CO2 in units of CO2-eq/kg material.

171

The specific EoL GWP for the materials was calculated using Equation 2, where 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝑂2 is the

172

100-year global warming potential of CO2 equal to 1 kg CO2-eq/kg CO2, 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 is the 100-year

carbon converted to CO2 (assumed 1 for compost and calculated for the material using the

192

of the straw. GHG emissions included CO2 and CH4; a 50% capture efficiency for landfill CH4

193

emissions was assumed.25 The social costs related to the marine plastic pollution of the straws

194

were calculated following our previously reported method26 and using Equation 4,

where 𝑉𝑃 is the social cost of marine plastic pollution for the straw, 𝛼𝑃 is the exchange constant

199

for marine plastic pollution, 𝜒𝑃 is the total fraction of plastic leaking into the ocean (0.11), 𝑓𝑃 is the

200

fraction with which drinking straws contribute to the total amount of leaked plastic (0.05), 𝑡𝐿 is the

201

projected lifetime of the straw, 𝑙0 is the initial length of the straw, and ℎ0 is the initial thickness of

202

the straw.2,27 The social cost calculation was adjusted by 𝜒𝑃 and 𝑓𝑃 because not every item leaks

203

into the environment.28 All dollar values are presented in 2024 U.S. dollars (US$).

RESULTS

206
207

Evaluating the potential environmental impacts of drinking straws requires knowing what

208

material(s) were used to make the straws and the dimensions and properties of the straws. This

209

data was collected by reviewing product marketing, regulatory, and third-party certification

210

documents and databases, as well as characterizing the thickness, mass, density, and

211

composition of the straws. Overall, the available information about the straws varied considerably

212

between brands. Paper straws were generally promoted as biodegradable and compostable,

213

often without emphasis on certifications. As for PP straws, marketing materials made little to no

214

mention of sustainability. Despite their differences, the unit price of each straw in 2023 dollars,

215

when purchased in bulk, ranged from 0.02 to 0.08 US$/straw. The properties of each straw are

216

summarized in Table 1.

PHA1

219
220

According to the manufacturer’s website, product packaging, and regulatory documents,29,30 the

221

PHA1 straw was made of a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) produced by Newlight Technologies

222

and met several third-party biodegradation certification standards for compostability (Tüv Austria

223

Home and Industrial S2100; BPI Certified).31,32 To meet the standards, the certifying bodies

224

prescribed a maximum nominal thickness for the straws of 152 µm (Tüv) and 182 µm (Tüv, BPI),

225

depending on the material and standard. Additionally, promotional materials from the

226

manufacturer labeled the straws as carbon-negative, sequestering 52.5 g CO2-eq/straw (119.9 kg

227

CO2-eq/kg material) as verified by SCS Global Services following ISO 14044:2006 for

228

manufacturing and disposal.33 Carbon sequestration resulted from the use of diverted

229

anthropogenic CH4 emissions as its feedstock.34 Analysis of the stable and radiocarbon isotopic

230

composition for the straw confirmed a fossil-derived methanogenic C source (Δ14C = -1000 

231

0.2‰, 13C = -42.3  0.1‰, n = 3).

232
233

PHA2

234
235

The packaging of the PHA2 straw stated it was made from a PHA material with the tradename

236

Nodax, produced by Danimer Scientific. In March 2025, Danimer Scientific filed for bankruptcy.35

237

Regulatory documents disclosed that the food-contact approved grade of these materials is a

238

random copolymer in which 3-hydroxybutyrate units represent approximately 75% of the polymer,

239

with 3-hydroxyvalerate, 3-hydroxyhexanoate, 3-hydroxyoctanoate, and/or 3-hydroxydecanoate

240

monomer units representing up to 25% of the polymer. 36 Nodax PHAs are certified bio-based (Tüv

241

Austria S0292), using vegetable oils as renewable feedstocks.32,37 The straws met several third-

242

party biodegradation standards for compostability (Tüv Austria Home S2594; BPI Certified). 31,32

243

To meet the standards, the certifying bodies prescribed a maximum nominal thickness for the

244

straws of 190 µm (Tüv) and 203.2 µm (BPI). While not advertised, it had a measurable inorganic

245

additive content of 15.9 wt%. The infrared (IR) spectrum of PHA2 reflected that of a PHA and

246

included characteristic peaks for CaCO3, indicating that its inorganic additive content was most

247

likely CaCO3 (Figure S7). Of Tüv Austria certified home compostable drinking straws, Nodax was

248

one of the most common materials used by different brands (e.g., LifeMade S2594, Biolo S2166,

249

Phade S1328, Eagle Beverage S2332, Urthpact S0589, Greenprint S2380). 32

250
251

PHA3

252
253

According to promotional documents and social media posts,38,39 the PHA3 straw was made of a

254

polyhydroxybutyrate-hexanoate (PHBH) produced by Kaneka Green Planet.40 Regulatory

255

documents disclosed that the food-contact grade of the material is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-

256

hydroxyhexanoate).41 The straws were labeled a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Certified

257

100% bio-based product and certified bio-based (Tüv Austria S0318), using vegetable oils as

258

renewable feedstocks.38 The straws met several third-party biodegradation standards for

259

compostability (Tüv Austria Home and Industrial S2541; BPI Certified). 31,32 To meet the standards,

260

the certifying bodies prescribed a maximum nominal thickness for the straws of 185 µm (BPI) and

261

320 µm (Tüv). The measured thickness was greater than the specified limit for BPI certification

(Table 1).38

266

According to the manufacturer’s website and promotional materials,42 the CaCO3 filled Resin

267

straws were made with a resin filled with calcium carbonate and unspecified enzymatic

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

268

degradation additives.43 The calcium carbonate was derived from waste oyster shells sourced

269

from Mexico. Marketing materials claimed the straws could biodegrade in 12-18 months in natural

270

landfills (ASTM D552644) and outdoor conditions through aerobic and anaerobic processes.43

271

According to the manufacturer’s website,45 the Agave Bagasse filled Resin straws were made

272

with material from the agave plant unused in tequila production and were biodegradable.46 The

273

formulated resin was claimed to have a lifetime of 10-24 months in soil.47 The manufacturers of

274

the CaCO3 filled- and Agave Bagasse filled- Resin straws did not disclose the polymer used to

275

make their straws in marketing materials. The IR spectra for the CaCO3 filled Resin and the Agave

276

Bagasse filled Resin straws matched that of PP (Figures S8-S9). Along with the characteristic

277

peaks for PP, the IR spectrum of the CaCO3 filled Resin straw included well-defined peaks for

278

CaCO3 at 1450, 1420, and 874 cm-1. The measured inorganic additive content was 17.8  0.1

279

wt% (n = 3), presumably all CaCO3.

280
281

Resin 1

282
283

Product packaging for the Resin 1 straw indicated it was made from NatureStar resin, advertised

284

as a biodegradable and compostable biopolymer.48,49 The product website stated that “straws will

285

breakdown within 12 months, leaving only biomass behind which can be used to enhance soil”.50

286

The straw met several third-party biodegradation standards for compostability (Tüv Austria Home

287

S2699; BPI Certified).31,32 In conflict with the certifications, the product page on the retailer’s

288

website stated that the straw is only commercially compostable. 49 To meet the standards, the

289

certifying bodies prescribed a maximum nominal thickness for the straws of 246 µm (BPI) and

290

190 µm (Tüv). The measured thickness was greater than the specified limit for Tüv certification

291

(Table 1). The polymer used in the NatureStar resin was undisclosed. The IR spectrum for the

292

Resin 1 straw suggested it was a PLA/PBAT blend, displaying peaks for both polymers (Figure

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

293

S10).51,52 The IR spectrum of the Resin 1 straw included characteristic peaks for PLA at 1754 and

294

757 cm-1 and for PBAT at 1712, 1169, 1121, and 725 cm -1.

295
296

Resin 2

297
298

According to marketing materials and the product website, 53 the Resin 2 straw was made from

299

SeaTech resin, a seaweed-derived bio-polymer blend compounded with "shell powder" and

300

"mineral color". More descript details on the material were disclosed in published patents,14,54

301

wherein the formulated resin can be composed of at least kappa-carrageenan, chitosan, glycerol,

302

calcium carbonate, and water. The measured inorganic additive content was 30.8  0.1 wt% (n =

303

3), and elemental analysis by X-ray fluorescence (XRD) of the inorganic material detected K, Ca,

304

Co, and Cr. The IR spectrum of the inorganic material included peaks for CaCO3, as well as

305

several others. Presumably, some of these additional IR peaks and the Co and Cr detected by

306

XRD belong to the blue mineral-based colorant (possibly cobalt chromite blue). The potassium

307

likely came from K2CO3, as it is mentioned as a possible component in a published patent, and

308

no other elements were detected by XRD as possible anions.

Biodegradation under coastal marine conditions

312
313

To establish the potential for marine biodegradation, oxygen respiration of the microbes

314

associated with the straws was assayed. Respiration rates greater than the seawater-only

315

baseline provide evidence that the associated microbes can biodegrade the straws. These short-

316

term bottle incubations over three weeks showed that the PHA1-3, Resin 1, and paper straws

317

stimulated microbial respiration to varying degrees above the baseline (Table S6), supporting

318

marine biodegradability. The Resin 1 and paper straws had comparable respiration rates, about

319

double those of the PHA1-3 straws. The PP-based straws (PP, CaCO3 filled Resin, and Agave

320

Bagasse filled Resin straws) had respiration rates comparable to seawater, discounting their

321

marine biodegradability. The Resin 2 straw was unable to be assayed due to complications with

322

the poisoning agent (Section S2).

323
324

While short-term bottle incubations help establish whether microbes can degrade a polymer, open

325

mesocosm systems provide more environmentally relevant evidence for microbial degradation of

326

a polymer over other available carbon sources in coastal settings (e.g., natural organic matter).

327

Thus, we incubated the straws for 30 weeks in a continuous flow seawater mesocosm to assess

328

the mass loss rates of the straws under coastal seawater conditions. All the straws developed

329

appreciable biofilms throughout the incubation (Figure 1A). By 30 weeks, the PHA straws lost 30-

330

50% of their mass, the paper straw lost ~70%, and the Resin 1 straw lost ~10% (Figure 1B-C).

331

The PP-based straws showed no mass loss (Figure 1C). Having established the potential for the

332

biodegradability of several straws and that our mesocosm is without mechanical action and

333

sunlight to cause fragmentation, any mass loss was attributed to biodegradation.

338

PP-based and Resin 1 straws (C) Data are presented as the mean  standard deviation of three

339

replicates unless otherwise noted (Table S4).

340
341

In contrast to the agreement between microbial respiration and mass loss for the PHA, paper, and

342

PP straws, the Resin 1 straw displayed unique behavior (Figure 1C, Table S6). The Resin 1 straw

343

had a relatively large amount of mass loss at the first time point, followed by a much slower mass

344

loss rate for the remainder of the incubation (Figure 1C). This behavior is likely from the rapid

345

leaching of a biodegradable additive,14,15 consistent with the large oxygen respiration rate for the

346

straw measured in the short-term respiration experiments.

347
348

The Resin 2 straw broke apart in the mesocosm and developed a paste-like consistency,

349

preventing an assessment of its mass loss. When incubated in the mesocosm, the straw broke

350

apart and accumulated at the bottom of the tank within 8 weeks (Figure S11). Over the next 30

351

weeks, there was little visual change in the amount of the Resin 2 material that settled to the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

352

bottom (Figure S11). Presumably, the material that collected at the bottom of the tank and

353

persisted was the inorganic material that made up the Resin 2 straw, as it retained its blue color.

354
355

Assessing microbial community composition provides an orthogonal measure of biodegradation.

356

Beta diversity analysis by Bray–Curtis dissimilarity indicated distinct community compositions in

357

response to the different materials (PERMANOVA, p<0.01) (Figure 2), suggesting the

358

degradability (Figure 1) and material properties of the straws selected for distinct microbial

359

communities. The straws that degraded had unique microbial communities, differentiating by the

360

type of material. In contrast, the three PP-based straws had similar community structures and

361

were separate from those of the degradable straws and seawater. This result suggests that these

362

straw materials mainly provided surfaces for the colonization of microorganisms rather than

363

substrates for metabolism, an observation consistent with our previous findings. 18 Microbial

364

community composition analysis at the family level revealed detailed differences between the

365

PHA, PP-based, Resin 1, paper straws, and seawater (Figure S12; Section S3), paving the way

366

for future investigations to delve into the details of specific microbial species and functions

367

underlying plastic biodegradation in the ocean.

Estimated environmental lifetimes under coastal marine conditions

375
376

The mass loss data were fit to a phenomenological surface erosion model to derive the specific

377

surface degradation rate (𝑘𝑑 ) of the straw materials. This material property quantifies the rate of

378

surface erosion of a material in a given environment, accounting for the effects of material

379

properties and environmental conditions. The values of 𝑘𝑑 for the PHA straws were 506 µm/year

380

for PHA1, 545 µm/year for PHA2, and 668 µm/year for PHA3. Though minor, the differences in

381

the values of 𝑘𝑑 for the PHA straws suggested an effect of the polymer, which should be

382

investigated further to understand the influence of PHA copolymer composition on degradation

383

rates. The values of 𝑘𝑑 for the paper and Resin 1 straws were 19018 µm/year and 70.6 µm/year,

384

respectively. The values of 𝑘𝑑 for the PP-based straws were constrained to less than 0.5 µm/year.

385
386

With the values of thickness and 𝑘𝑑 , the projected environmental lifetimes of the straws were

387

calculated. The paper straw had the shortest projected environmental lifetime of 111 months.

388

Values of projected environmental lifetime for the PHA straws were 152 months for PHA1, 212

389

months for PHA2, and 233 months for PHA3. The Resin 1 straw had a projected lifetime of

390

19720 months. The projected environmental lifetimes for the PP-based straws were constrained

391

to a minimum of 1800 months. No environmental lifetime was projected for the Resin 2 straw.

392
393

DISCUSSION

394
395

Drinking straws reflect the broader challenges to create products that i) work as intended, ii) meet

396

consumer preferences, iii) are inexpensive, and now iv) satisfy circularity, sustainability, and

397

degradability goals. Achieving these objectives for a drinking straw, an arguably simple product is

398

not so simple, as evidenced by the different straws investigated in this study. Each product

399

satisfies these four criteria to varying degrees and via different approaches. For the first three

400

criteria, each straw works as intended, meets consumer preferences, and is inexpensive to

401

differing extents (Section S4).

402
403

To satisfy circularity, sustainability, and degradability goals, each straw approached them through

404

different combinations of feedstock, plastic formulation, and EoL management. All but the Resin

405

2 straw was included in this analysis because of a lack of reliable data for this material.

406

Nonetheless, a brief general discussion on the sustainability of seaweed-based materials is

407

presented in Section S5. Additionally, the straws investigated in our previous study 14 (CDA, PLA,

408

PHA4, and PHA5, see Section S1) were included to reflect the broader design space of drinking

409

straws.

410
411

Feedstock renewability

412
413

To fit into a circular economy framework, a renewable feedstock is one in which the carbon has

414

been recirculated, including carbon obtained from biomass, industrial by-products, waste CO2 or

415

CH4, or recycled plastics.55 Most straws were made from 100% renewable materials (Figure 3A).

416

Only those with fossil-based polymers (i.e., PP and Resin 1) were partially or entirely made from

417

non-renewable materials.

418
419

The investigated PP-based straws appear to use comparable amounts of polymer to that of a

420

pure PP straw, negating the otherwise would be benefit of the renewably sourced filler. PP is

421

primarily produced using non-renewable petroleum sources, and ~5.5% is recycled. Biogenic

422

fillers (i.e., oyster-derived CaCO3 and agave-derived bagasse) can reduce the total amount of

423

polymer by replacing it with a renewable material. For instance, the CaCO3 filled Resin had an

424

average mass of ~746 mg, being ~18 wt% CaCO 3 meant that ~612 mg of the straw was PP,

425

effectively the same amount of material as the pure PP straw (~615 mg).

426
427

PHAs are produced by fermentation, using various carbon sources as feedstocks.56 The PHA

428

used in the PHA1 straw uses CH4 diverted from anthropogenic sources (e.g., wastewater, cattle

429

farming, landfills, and coal mining) as the carbon source, yielding a carbon offsetting material. In

430

contrast, the PHA2-5 straws use agricultural products, such as vegetable oils, to produce their

431

PHA materials. PHA2 was not 100% renewable because of its fraction of CaCO3 of unknown

432

origin (assumed non-biogenic).

433
434

Similar to PHAs, PLA is synthesized using lactic acid produced by the fermentation of agricultural

435

products.57 Therefore, PHAs and PLA made using these feedstocks can be certified as 100% bio-

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

436

based. The Resin 1 straw was determined to be a blend of PLA and PBAT, and so was partially

437

bio-based, owing to its PLA content. PBAT is predominantly fossil-based, but efforts are being

438

made to circularize its feedstocks to include those from recycled materials and bio-based sources.

439
440

Historically, CDA has been a mixed feedstock wherein the cellulose was bio-derived, and the

441

carbon within the acetyl modification was derived from coal. Recognizing the non-renewability of

442

coal as a carbon source, more sustainable grades of CDA are being produced by deriving the

443

acetyl C from molecularly recycled mixed waste.58

444
445

Material efficiency

446
447

Material efficiency quantifies the amount of material used to make a functional product. 59

448

Optimizing the material efficiency of a plastic product has the added benefit of reducing many

449

other environmental impacts (e.g., GHG emissions and freshwater usage) because these impacts

450

are largely proportional to the amount of material used. 60–62 Material efficiency also affects

451

environmental impacts related to shipping because fuel efficiency decreases with increasing

452

cargo weight by a nontrivial amount.59,63 Because all the straws have the same function, their

453

mass is a measure of their material efficiency. The PHA1 straw had the greatest material

454

efficiency, followed by the PP straw (Figure 3B). The PHA1 straw used ~33% less material than

455

the PP straw. The other PHA and PP-based straws were less materially efficient, using more

456

material to produce a functional product. The paper straw was one of the least efficient, requiring

457

~60% more material than the PP straw.

459

Embodied GHG Emissions

460

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

461

A first estimate for the GHG emissions of a product are the emissions associated with the

462

production of its materials. Because the specific embodied GHG emissions of plastics are within

463

an order of magnitude of each other, as were the masses of each straw, differences in GHG

464

emissions between products were expected to be marginal.26 This was not the case.

465
466

PHA1 was the only straw with net-negative embodied GHG emissions (Figure 3C), owing to

467

diverted CH4 emissions as its feedstock. Scaling this approach could impact the global C cycle

468

and climate change. For instance, if all the C used in plastic packaging globally (~142 Mt/yr 64)

469

were P3HB (~56 wt% C) and came from anthropogenic CH4, then ~71 Mt CH4 (~2.2 Gt CO2-eq)

470

would be needed. Adopting this strategy would offset ~20% of the ~9.7 Gt CO2-eq of annual global

471

anthropogenic CH4 emissions.65 Conversely, the other straws were all carbon-positive, ranging

472

from 0.80 kg CO2-eq/1000 straws for the paper to 4.16 kg CO2-eq/1000 straws for the Resin1,

473

PLA/PBAT-based straw (Figure 3C).

474
475

Relative to selecting materials with more renewable feedstocks, the effectiveness of biogenic

476

fillers appears negligible. The theoretical maximum offset in GHG emissions for oyster-derived

477

CaCO3 is ~0.44 kg CO2-eq/kg CaCO3. In practice, this value is likely reduced as GHG emissions

478

can be associated with the processing of the oyster shells to yield CaCO 3 of a quality suitable for

479

compounding. Based on its formulation, the theoretical maximum reduction in embodied GHG

480

emissions compared to the PP straw is only 4% for the CaCO 3 filled Resin straw. The value of the

481

theoretical specific embodied GHG emissions for agave-derived bagasse is greater than oyster-

482

derived CaCO3, offsetting ~1.51 kg CO2-eq/kg agave-derived bagasse. As with oyster-derived

483

CaCO3, this value is likely less because of GHG emissions associated with processing the

484

material. While the amount of agave-derived bagasse used in the Agave Bagasse filled Resin

485

straw was not disclosed, biocomposites of agave-derived bagasse and PP typically include 20-

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

486

30 wt% bagasse. Within this range, the estimated reduction in embodied GHG emissions for the

487

Agave Bagasse filled Resin straw compared to the PP straw was 8 to 28%.

488
489

Water usage

490
491

An impact of growing concern is a material’s embodied water usage because of the scarcity and

492

diminishing quality of freshwater resources globally.66,67 Generally, plastics derived from

493

agricultural products have greater embodied water usage than petroleum-derived plastics, owing

494

to the water used in agriculture and downstream processing. However, these impacts can be an

495

order of magnitude less than those resulting from paper production. Paper and pulp mills pollute

496

freshwater ecosystems and diminish their value, as well.68 Reported values for the embodied

497

water usage of PP, PHA, and paper are 32 L/kg, 240 L/kg, and 1700 L/kg, respectively. 69 Thus,

498

while the paper straw can have some of the lowest embodied GHG emissions (~2-3 times less

499

than the others, excluding PHA1), it can have substantial embodied water penalties (~10-80 times

500

more than the others) (Figure 3D). Water is a valuable natural resource; thus, reducing its usage

501

as much as possible will benefit society.70,71

502
503

EoL (mis)management and GWP

504
505

Managed EoL. The strategies advertised and promoted for the managed EoL of the straws varied

506

with the material. The PP-based straws were intended to follow a linear EoL path with disposal in

507

landfills. The PHA-based, paper, and Resin 2 straws were intended to follow a more circular EoL

508

path with disposal in industrial or home composting systems. The Resin 1 straw was intended to

509

be industrially composted.

510

511

Today, most managed plastic waste is landfilled,72 some is incinerated, and even less is recycled

512

and composted.73 While PP is recyclable, PP straws are often not accepted by municipal recycling

513

facilities because of their size and shape, and contamination from food. In the U.S., ~63% of

514

municipal solid waste is landfilled.74 In many instances, it is the only waste management option

515

available.

516
517

The filled PP straws were claimed to biodegrade in landfills. The CaCO3 filled Resin straw was

518

advertised for disposal in landfills and to be formulated with an enzymatic package to support its

519

biodegradation in that environment.43 These additives are designed to stimulate enzymatic

520

degradation of the polymer by fouling microbes under anaerobic conditions, though their

521

effectiveness has been dubious.75,76 Collectively, the respiration, mass loss, and microbial

522

community composition analyses suggest these additives were not stimulating the biodegradation

523

of the PP matrix in aerobic marine conditions. The Agave Bagasse filled Resin straw was

524

advertised for “avoiding landfills” but did not mention where it was intended to go. Being PP, this

525

straw likely could only be properly disposed of by landfilling or incineration. There is little evidence

526

to support the possibility of either straw’s biodegradation in landfills (i.e., no third-party certificates

527

for the products). However, taken at face value, assuming the claims hold that the filled PP straws

528

can biodegrade in terrestrial and landfill environments, their disposal in landfills would result in

529

biogenic CH4 emissions (Figure 3E). Landfills contribute ~10% of global anthropogenic CH4

530

emissions, and their leachates can diminish fresh and groundwater resources. 77 Because of

531

biogenic CH4 emissions, promoting landfilling as the managed EoL strategy can have significant

532

associated GHG emissions for all but the non-biodegradable straws (Figure 3E).

533
534

Composting can be an alternative EoL strategy. Unlike landfilling, composting is an aerobic

535

microbial degradation process that converts organic matter to biomass and CO2, not CH4. As a

536

result, the GWP of GHG emissions can be an order of magnitude less for compost than landfill

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

537

(Figure 3E). Composting can be operated on the industrial scale using elevated temperatures or

538

at the individual scale using ambient conditions (i.e., home composting). Some materials are only

539

certified industrially-compostable (e.g., PLA), while others are certified home-compostable (e.g.,

540

PBAT, PHA, and CDA). For food-soiled, single-use items, composting affords a strategy well-

541

equipped to handle such waste alongside food scraps.

542
543

Nonetheless, composting has its challenges. Presently, composting is rarely practiced and lacks

544

available infrastructure at the municipal level. In the U.S., it has been estimated that only ~4% of

545

food waste is composted.78 Thus, while products are meant for and designed to be composted,

546

they may rarely follow that intended path and instead enter landfills or incinerators. Moreover,

547

composting is not without its environmental impacts, as well. Improperly aerated compost can

548

result in CH4 emissions in the same way as landfills. For composting to be broadly adopted, it will

549

require greater investment by consumers and communities in composting capabilities for

550

biodegradable plastics.

551
552

Mismanaged EoL. Drinking straws can be mismanaged at their EoL by being littered or disposed

553

of in the wrong waste stream (e.g., landfilled instead of composted). In the event of littering,

554

several of the straws will persist in the coastal ocean despite claims of their degradability in other

555

environments (e.g., compost or soil). The PP-based and Resin 1 straws were estimated to persist

556

for decades or much longer if leaked (Figure 3F). Notably, the Resin 1 straw exhibited ~10%

557

mass loss after 30 weeks of incubation (Figure 1). However, the microbial community structure

558

was similar to that of the PP-based straws (Figure 2), which is unexpected if the community was

559

adapting to metabolize PBAT. Considering this finding, further analyses of the Resin 1 material

560

are necessary to confirm whether the shallow mass loss rate after the first time point was due to

561

a residual additive slowly leaching, the slow metabolism of the polymer by fouling microbes, or

562

other processes. Conversely, because the PHA- and CDA-based straws were shown to

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vtczp ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-8310 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

563

biodegrade in the coastal ocean, they were estimated to last 1-2 years, slightly longer than paper.

564

For the straws that were not persistent, their differences in estimated environmental lifetimes

565

reflected tradeoffs in material and geometric properties.

566
567

Disposal of drinking straws in landfills intended for compost results in additional and more potent

568

GHG emissions that otherwise would not have been produced. This outcome is because

569

anaerobic landfill conditions produce CH4 during the biodegradation of the material that escapes

570

collection. The added GWP from improper disposal of compostable materials in landfills was

571

estimated to range from 4.64 to 13.44 kg CO 2-eq/1000 straws (Figure 3E), resulting in

572

approximately six times more GWP per straw. The conventional PP straw, in contrast, has zero

573

GWP in compost or landfills because of its presumed recalcitrance in landfills.

574
575

Social costs of GHG emissions and plastic pollution

576
577

Social costs were used to quantify, contextualize, and compare the environmental impacts of

578

marine plastic pollution and GHG emissions. Social costs reflect the external costs to society

579

associated with a good, service, or outcome. The exchange constant (the conversion factor of

580

environmental impact to monetary value) for the social cost of marine plastic pollution was

581

proposed to range between 4.58 to 45.8 US$/year kg plastic.79 Using the lower value for a

582

conservative estimate, switching from persistent to non-persistent plastics for drinking straws can

583

equate to savings for society of ~3 $USD/1000 straws (Table S7). Scaled to the estimated number

584

of straws that leak into the environment in the U.S. annually, the switch represents a potential

585

savings of ~150 million US$/year.

586
587

Social costs were also quantified for GHG emissions associated with producing straws and

CO2 and CH4 have been estimated to be 0.22 US$/kg CO2 and 3.40 US$/kg CH4, respectively.80,81

590

The social costs for the embodied GHG emissions of the straws (excluding PHA1) ranged from

591

0.18-0.92 US$/1000 straws and scaled to the annual consumption rate of drinking straws in the

592

U.S. could cost 9 to 46 million US$/year. PHA1 was unique because it had negative embodied

593

GHG emissions at the beginning of life from using diverted anthropogenic CH4 as a feedstock. As

594

a result, it was estimated to equate to savings of 11.55 US$/1000 straws or ~578 million US$/year.

595

The social costs from the added GHG emissions due to landfilling a compostable drinking straw

596

ranged from ~0.21-0.61 US$/1000 straws (Table S7) and scaled to the estimated annual U.S.

597

drinking straw consumption rate, representing a potential burden of 11 to 31 million US$/year.

598
599

From this analysis, three key points emerged. First, conventional PP straws do not contribute to

600

societal costs in terms of GHG emissions at EoL regardless of whether they accumulate in

601

compost or landfill because they are non-biodegradable; however, they contribute sizably to

602

societal costs when littered in the marine environment for that same reason. Second, for PHA1,

603

the societal costs at EoL, regardless of the scenarios investigated, could be entirely offset by the

604

savings to society by using diverted CH4 emissions as a feedstock to produce the polymer. Lastly,

605

the societal costs from the improper disposal of compostable and marine-biodegradable straws

606

(i.e., paper, PHA, and CDA) in landfills were estimated to be 18-36 times greater than those from

607

their improper disposal as marine litter (Table S7). While this analysis only discusses the social

608

costs of two environmental impacts (plastic pollution and GHG emissions), of which there are

609

several others (e.g., resource utilization and eutrophication), it was instructive for contextualizing

610

the relative burden of the different drinking straws at EoL.

Implications

617
618

From this case study of drinking straws, four valuable lessons were learned. First, the combination

619

of approaches taken by the PHA1 straw resulted in a product that qualitatively and quantitatively

620

could be the least impactful. It fits within a circular materials framework, had the greatest material

621

efficiency, was non-persistent in the coastal ocean, and was carbon-offsetting by utilizing diverted

622

anthropogenic CH4 emissions as a feedstock. These design decisions are a promising set that

623

could be adopted for other materials and products. Second, inorganic fillers can offset GHG at

624

EoL, and biogenic wastes can be repurposed as fillers into new products, sequestering carbon

625

as well. However, merely adding fillers to the status quo polymer (e.g., PP) will likely not produce

626

significant benefits for the environment compared to using an alternative polymer. Third, many of

627

the claims made by brands about circularity had limited supporting data, which likely will lead to

628

the mismanagement of their products and unreliable outcomes. Thus, additional certifications are

629

needed to give credibility to life cycle claims and the impacts that can result from different life

630

cycle scenarios. Lastly, improper disposal of compostable products in landfills can have sizable

631

environmental impacts, thereby warranting greater investment in infrastructure to manage

632

compostable plastics and associated food waste properly. Otherwise, many of the advantages

633

afforded by these materials will be nullified. Moving forward, from our analysis, consumers,

634

brands, and policymakers should support products that divert anthropogenic GHGs for use as

635

renewable feedstocks, promote the design of products for material efficiency and minimal

636

persistence, and bolster proper disposal of compostable products by enhancing consumer

637

education and supporting investment in industrial and home composting facilities.
