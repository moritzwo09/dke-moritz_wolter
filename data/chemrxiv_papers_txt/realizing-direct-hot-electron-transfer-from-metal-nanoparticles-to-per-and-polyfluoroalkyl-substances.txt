Abstract
Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of forever synthetic chemicals.
They are widely utilized in industries and household appliances because of their remarkable
stability and distinctive oil- and water-repellent properties. Despite their broad applications,
unfortunately, PFAS are hazardous to all forms of life, including humans. In recent years, the
environmental persistence of PFAS has raised significant interest in degrading these substances.
However, the strong C−F bonds in these chemicals pose several challenges to their degradation. Plasmons of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) offer many exciting applications, including
photocatalytic reactions. However, an atomistic understanding of plasmon-driven processes
remains elusive. In this work, using the real-time time-dependent density functional theory,
we have studied the real-time formation of plasmons, hot-carrier generation, and subsequent
direct hot-carrier transfer from metal NP to the PFAS. Our simulations show that there is an
apparent direct hot-electron transfer from NP to PFAS. Moreover, using Ehrenfest dynamics
simulations, we demonstrated that the transferred hot-electrons can efficiently degrade PFAS
without requiring any external thermal bath. Thus, our work provides an atomistic picture of
plasmon-induced direct hot-carrier transfer from NP to PFAS and the efficient degradation of
PFAS. We strongly believe that this work generates the impetus to utilize plasmonic NPs to
mitigate PFAS.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
are man-made chemicals containing strong
carbon-fluorine bonds. 1–4 Due to their unique
properties, they have been widely used in various industries, such as aviation, food packaging, and textiles. 5,6 However, it was later realized that PFAS pose severe health challenges
to various organisms, including humans. 7 Human beings are primarily exposed to PFAS
through contaminated water and food. 8–12 Fur-

thermore, several recent studies have shown
that PFAS can transfer from mother to child
at the embryonic stage itself. 13–15 Considering the toxicological impacts of PFAS, several
environmental agencies have banned a variety
of these chemicals and released health advisories on their permissible daily intake limits.
For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has specified 0.004 and
0.02 ng/L as the daily intake limit for perfluo1

rooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), respectively. 16 Given the
harmful effects of PFAS, developing efficient
technologies and strategies to eliminate these
toxic substances from the environment is essential. Consequently, there has been a surge
in global research to find effective methods to
treat “PFAS-contaminated" water. 17 Numerous studies have explored both chemical and
physical approaches to remediate PFAS. 18–33
However, existing treatment techniques such as
ion-exchange, adsorption, and coagulation are
ineffective in degrading these substances and
often require further processing.

ment or heat produced due to the plasmon
decay within the NP. 63–66 Given the diverse
range of processes that plasmonic excitations
can trigger, there is a significant potential to
utilize them for the degradation of PFAS. In
this study, we explored the plasmon-induced
CT dynamics at various NP-PFAS interfaces.
Between the direct and indirect CT processes,
the indirect CT process 47,59,67–69 is generally
less efficient in driving the chemical reactions
since the generated hot-carriers experience energy losses due to scattering with other electrons and phonons within the NP before reaching the molecule. 47,59,69–73 At the same time, the
direct CT process is generally found to be less
probable than the indirect CT process, specifically at the NP-molecule interfaces. 71,73 Therefore, there is an apparent need to understand
these processes at the atomic scale to further
enhance the CT efficiencies from the NP to the
molecule. However, unfortunately, disentangling the contributions of direct and indirect
pathways is experimentally quite challenging
because both these processes often occur simultaneously and at ultrafast time scale (< 100
fs). Computational studies using the real-time
time-dependent density functional theory (RTTDDFT) have been resourceful in obtaining
atomic-scale insights into the plasmon-driven
hot-carrier dynamics, 55,74 particularly in understanding the direct transfer of hot-carriers
at the NP-molecule interfaces.

Recently, plasmon-induced processes have
garnered significant attention for their ability to drive complex chemical reactions at the
nanoparticle-molecule interface, such as water
splitting, 34–38 H2 dissociation, 39–44 CO2 reduction, 45–49 and N2 dissociation. 50–53 Plasmondriven chemical reactions are induced through
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), 54
which refers to the collective excitation of free
charge carriers in a metallic nanoparticle (NP)
by absorbing visible light at the plasmon resonance frequency. In general, the plasmonic excitation decays to generate hot-carriers 55 (nonthermal carriers with excess energy), which can
be transferred to nearby acceptors (molecules
or semiconductors) to drive chemical reactions. 56,57 The transfer of hot-carriers to the
molecule can occur either via indirect or direct charge transfer (CT) mechanisms. 47,58,59
In the indirect CT mechanism, 60 the plasmon
decays within the NP to generate hot-carriers,
which will be subsequently transferred to the
molecule. In contrast, the direct CT mechanism 61,62 involves the decay of plasmons by
directly exciting the electrons/holes from the
NP into the unoccupied/occupied orbitals of
the molecule. The difference between the direct
and indirect processes depends on the interaction between the NP and adsorbate, where a
van der Waals interaction promotes the indirect
CT, whereas a chemical interaction is required
to drive direct CT. Apart from these CT processes, the adsorbate could also undergo chemical transformation due to the field enhance-

In this article, by considering Ag147 as a prototypical example of a plasmonic NP and PFOA
as a representative PFAS, we explored plasmondriven hot-carrier dynamics across the NPPFAS interface using RT-TDDFT. We present
the temporal, spatial, and energetic pictures
of the plasmon formation and hot-carrier generation at various interfacial geometries. Our
study reveals that the dominant pathway for
the plasmon decay occurs via the generation
of hot-carriers within the NP, and the next
dominant pathway includes the direct hotelectron transfer from the NP to PFOA. In
contrast, the contributions to the plasmon decay from (i) direct hot-hole transfer from the

NP to PFOA and (ii) intramolecular excitations
within PFOA are quite insignificant. Among
the dominant pathways, since the direct CT
pathway is efficient in driving chemical reactions, we explored this pathway in this work.
To further tune the amount of direct CT, we
studied various NP-molecule interfaces and considered different electric field polarization directions. We find that the maximum direct hotelectron transfer occurs when the molecule is
kept along the z-direction of the nanoparticle
and when the electric field is transversely polarized. Next, since higher electric field intensities are often used to dissociate molecules, we
varied the pulse intensities from 0.514 mV/Å
to 514 mV/Å and found that increasing pulse
intensity results in a significant increase in the
hot-electron transfer from the NP to PFOA.
Finally, to provide direct evidence for the
plasmon-induced degradation of PFAS, we conducted Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (EMD)
simulations on Ag55 -PFOA complex (due to
the requirement of large computational resources, we could not conduct EMD simulations on Ag147 -PFOA complex). These EMD
simulations clearly demonstrate that a PFOA
molecules undergoes a near-complete degradation due to hot-electron transfer. We hope that
this work provides the necessary impetus to
leverage the potential of plasmonic technologies
to degrade the forever and harmful PFAS.
Plasmon formation and hot-carrier dynamics in NP-PFOA interface. Figures
1(a) and 1(b) depict the optimized geometry
and the projected density of states (pDOS) of
the NP-PFOA interface. Clearly, the contributions to the total DOS of the NP-PFOA complex are mainly arising due to the NP, indicating that the adsorption of PFOA did not modify the electronic structure of the NP significantly. Figure 1(c) depicts the photoabsorption spectra of the bare NP, PFOA, and the
NP-PFOA complex. The energy corresponding
to the maximum absorption is at 3.83 eV for
both NP and NP-PFOA complex, which corresponds to the plasmon resonance frequency
(established later). Although there is a slight
increment in the absorption intensity, the peak
positions of the NP are mostly unaltered in the

presence of PFOA, indicating that the absorption spectrum of the complex has a major contribution from the NP. Also, the excitations in
bare PFOA molecule (first peak is at 7.85 eV)
are far away from the plasmonic peak of the NP,
and their absorption intensity is quite small.
To establish the plasmonic nature of the 3.83
eV peak, we plotted the induced charge density of the complex (at 3.83 eV) in Figure 1(d),
where orange and blue colors represent the accumulation and depletion of the electron density, respectively. The clear separation of the
positive and negative charges at the opposite
ends of the NP confirms the presence of LSPR.
To further understand the nature of this excitation, we employed the Kohn-Sham (KS) decomposition technique (where each excitation
is decomposed into individual KS electron-hole
transitions) as a transition contribution map
(TCM) in Figure 1(e) . 74 In TCM, the red features correspond to strong positive constructive
contributions from the KS transitions, the blue
features correspond to large negative contributions that screen the plasmonic excitation, and
the solid black diagonal line represents the resonant transitions at ω0 = 3.83 eV. The nature
of these transitions can be understood using the
pDOS plots, which are given in Figures 1(e) and
1(f). The states near the Fermi level have major contributions from the s and p-states of the
NP, whereas the d-states of the NP contribute
majorly below −4 eV. From these plots, it is evident that the bright red features in the TCM
plot at around −1 eV are arising due to the intraband sp-sp transitions, and the blue features
at around −4 eV are arising due to the interband d-sp transitions. The presence of several
red features (sp-sp transitions) below the diagonal line establishes the plasmonic nature of the
3.83 eV excitation. 55,74 Together, these results
demonstrate that exciting the system at 3.83
eV induces a plasmonic resonance in the NPPFOA complex. Therefore, to probe the dynamics of plasmon formation and decay, we applied a Gaussian pulse (Eq. 1) that is tuned to
the plasmonic peak. Since the plasmon formation and decay often occur in an ultrafast manner (∼ 1 − 30 fs), 55,73,75 we conducted the RTTDDFT simulations for a duration of 30 fem3

toseconds (fs). Also, this time period is found
to be sufficient to capture the hot-carrier dynamics in the NP-PFAS complex.
Figure 2 (a) depicts the incident Gaussian
pulse, which is centered at 10 fs and has a
mild pulse strength of 514 µV/Å. The temporal changes in the induced dipole moment of the
complex, due to its interaction with the pulse,
are shown in Figure 2 (b). During the first 10
fs, the dipole moment of the complex oscillates
in phase with the pulse and its magnitude increases with the pulse strength. However, while
the pulse begins to decay after 10 fs, the dipole
moment continues to increase, reaching its peak
between 10-12 fs. Moreover, the induced dipole
moment persists in the system until 27 fs, which
is well-beyond the complete decay of the pulse
at 15 fs. To further understand the relation between the dipole moment changes and the plasmon dynamics, we plotted the induced charge
densities at five different instances of time, as
shown in Figure 2(c), and these time instances
are marked as vertical dashed lines in panel (b),
labeled as (1)−(5). At 10.2 fs (1), after the
pulse crossed its highest value, the dipole moment is significant due to the LSPR, as revealed
by the induced density. Similarly, at 11 fs (2),
the dipole moment is zero due to the vanishing
surface-to-surface induced charge density oscillation. At 11.84 fs (3), the dipole moment is
significant and switches its sign due to the polarity change in the induced charge density. At
20 fs (4), which is 5 fs after the complete decay
of the pulse, the dipole moment has reduced
significantly due to the dephasing of the plasmonic excitation as indicated by the lowered
induced density. Finally, by 26.6 fs (5), the induced density becomes vanishingly small, indicating the lack of any collective excitations in
the system, which explains the total decay in
the dipole moment. Thus, the time-dependent
dipole moment and the induced charge density
provide an illustrative picture of plasmon formation and dephasing.
Next, to get an energetic picture of plasmon
formation and hot-carrier generation, we employ the energy decomposition technique developed by Rossi et al., 55 where the total energy
stored in the excitation is primarily divided into

resonant and nonresonant transitions. Here,
the nature of a transition is obtained by examining the difference between the KS transition
energy (ωia = ϵa − ϵi ) and the plasmon resonance energy (ω0 ). When |ωia
√−ω0 | ≥ 2σ, where
σ is the pulse width (σ = 2/τ0 , where τ0 is
the pulse width in time-space), the transitions
are considered as the nonresonant transitions.
In contrast, resonant transitions occur when
|ωia −ω0 | ≤ 2σ. Among the nonresonant transitions, the low-energy transitions (ωia ≤ ω0 −2σ)
forms a plasmon, and the high-energy transitions (ωia ≥ ω0 + 2σ) leads to plasmon dephasing. Specific to the noble metals, the coupled
intraband sp-sp transitions are responsible for
the formation of a plasmon, and the interband
d-s transitions are responsible for the plasmon
dephasing (as discussed earlier while explaining
the TCM plots).
The time-dependent variation of the resonant
and nonresonant transition contributions to the
total energy stored in the excited state are depicted in Figure 2 (d). Before 10.2 fs, the total
excited state energy has a major contribution
only from the nonresonant transitions. This is
because the incident light pulse is tuned to the
LSPR frequency of the NP-PFOA complex, allowing the complex to absorb the energy from
light and stay in an excited state. However,
beyond 10.2 fs, the contribution from the resonant transitions increases since the plasmon
begins to decay into hot-carriers (resonant transitions). At around 26.6 fs, the total energy is
exclusively stored as the resonant contributions,
indicating the complete decay of plasmons into
hot-carriers. In addition to the resonant and
nonresonant contributions, Figure 2 (d) also
shows the portion of the total excited state energy that is stored in the form of Coulomb energy. Clearly, similar to the dipole moment, the
Coulomb energy also oscillates with time, which
is due to the strong oscillations in the surface
charge density (Figure 2 (c)). Finally, it is important to note that our simulations show that
the total excited state energy remains constant
even after the pulse has ended (beyond 15 fs).
However, in reality, the excited state energy will
be dissipated to the environment through various processes, including radiative and nonradia5

tive decay channels, 76,77 in the order of several
hundred picoseconds to nanoseconds. Studying
these processes is beyond the scope of this article.
To further understand the distribution of
total energy in terms of the individual KS
electron-hole transitions, we plotted TCMs at
11 and 26.6 fs in Figure 3 (a). Here, the solid
vertical and horizontal lines (white) correspond
to the Fermi level, whereas the solid diagonal
line is the resonance energy (ω0 = 3.83 eV).
The dashed diagonal lines that are drawn above
and below the main diagonal line correspond to
ω0 + 2σ and ω0 − 2σ, respectively. The TCM
plot at 11 fs has several strong features both
across the diagonal line and well below the diagonal line, indicating that the excited state
energy is distributed among several KS transitions. Specifically, the features far below the
resonance line (at ∼ −1 eV) contribute to the
plasmonic (nonresonant) excitations arising due
to the intraband sp-sp transitions. On the other
hand, the interband d-s transitions are across
the diagonal line, and they contribute to the
single-particle (resonant) excitations. Therefore, at 11 fs, the total energy is distributed
among both the resonant and nonresonant transitions. In contrast, the TCM plot at 26.6 fs has
strong features only across the diagonal line,

suggesting that the entire energy at this time
step is majorly stored in the resonant transitions.
Next, we studied the energetic spread of the
resonant and nonresonant carriers across the
Fermi level by using the√transition probability, 55 Pia (t) = |δρia (t)/ fi − fa |2 , where fi
and fa are the ground-state occupations in
the basis of the occupied (i) and unoccupied
(a) KS states, respectively, and the KS transition density matrix is defined as δρia (t) =
ρia (t) − ρia (0). The occupations of electrons
in state P
a and holes in state i P
are given by
Pae (t) = i Pia (t) and Pih (t) = a Pia (t), respectively. The hot-electron occupation probability across various KS eigenstates at time t

computed as Pe (E, t) = a Pa (t)Ga (E). Similarly, the hot-hole
P h distribution is calculated as
Ph (E, t) =

Gi (E) are Gaussian broadening functions. The
occupation probabilities of the KS states for
both holes and electrons that are arising due to
both the resonant and nonresonant transitions
are shown in Figure 3 (b) at 11 and 26.6 fs. At
11 fs, clearly the nonresonant contributions are
the dominant ones, and the corresponding carriers are majorly distributed between -1 to 1 eV
across the Fermi level. There are also a few car6

riers due to the resonant transitions, which are
primarily localized at -4 eV for the holes and
closer to the Fermi level for the electrons. In
other words, the generation of hot-holes started
at 11 fs itself (due to the interband transitions).
In contrast, at 26.6 fs, the KS states are primarily occupied by the carriers arising due to the
resonant transitions, with negligible contributions from the nonresonant transitions. It is apparent that the carriers at 26.6 fs have energies
that are far away from the Fermi level, indicating that these are hot-carriers. Interestingly,
the majority of the hot-electrons lie near the
Fermi level, arising from the plasmon dephasing
due to the interband d-sp transitions as their
energy is in resonance with the plasmon excitation energy of ω0 . Notably, the hot-electrons
also have a significant distribution near 3 eV of
energy and a few electrons also up to the plasmon resonance energy ω0 . So far, we clearly
established (i) the temporal evolution of the
plasmon formation and decay, (ii) the energetic
distribution of hot-carriers, and (iii) the hotcarrier dynamics. Next, we will describe the
plasmon-induced hot-carrier transfer from the
NP to the PFOA molecule.
Plasmon-induced hot-carrier transfer.
As discussed in the introduction, the hotcarriers generated during the plasmon decay
can be transferred to the PFOA molecule primarily via two pathways, namely, the indirect and direct charge transfer mechanisms.
A schematic of these pathways is shown in
Figure 4. The direct charge transfer mechanism can further be divided into (i) direct
hot-electron transfer (DHET) and (ii) direct
hot-hole transfer (DHHT). In DHET (DHHT),
the electrons in the occupied states of the NP
(molecule) transfer to the unoccupied states of
the molecule (NP), creating electrons (holes) in
the molecule and holes (electrons) in the NP.
To compute the plasmon-induced direct charge
transfer processes, we followed the method proposed by Kumar et al. 61,78 Here, we partitioned
the simulation box into two spatial regions separating the NP and PFOA and computed the
hot-carrier transfer by considering the transitions among the occupied and unoccupied
orbitals of these two components. Naturally,

Figure 4: A schematic representation of plasmon-induced charge transfer dynamics from NP to
molecule. (a) and (b) correspond to the indirect and direct charge transfer processes, respectively.
A laser pulse tuned to the plasmon resonance energy is shown in red color. In the indirect process,
LSPR decays within the NP by creating the hot-electron and hole pairs, which then transfer to
the nearby molecule. In contrast, in the direct charge transfer process, LSPR decays by directly
generating the hot-carriers in the molecule.
four kinds of transitions are feasible, namely,
NP → NP, PFOA → PFOA, NP → PFOA,
and PFOA → NP, where the last two transitions correspond to the DHET and DHHT
processes, respectively. The calculated number of carriers generated via four partial processes is shown in Figure 5 (a). Among the
four kinds of transitions, the plasmon decay
predominantly occurs through the creation
of hot-carriers within the NP (with a probability of around 93 %). The next dominant
mechanism is the DHET, which occurs with
a probability of 6.8 %. As mentioned in the
introduction, it should be noted that the direct
charge transfer process is less probable than
the indirect charge transfer process, specifically
in NP-molecule complexes. 73,78,79 For example,
earlier works have reported the DHET with a
probability of ∼ 0.8% for the Au87 −CO complex 79 and ∼ 2% for Ag147 −CO complex. 78
Compared to these studies, the observed 7%
DHET is significantly higher. Moreover, as
shown in our Ehrenfest simulations (presented
later), this percentage is large enough to drive
the degradation of PFAS. The probabilities for
the other two processes, namely, the DHHT

and intramolecular excitations, are insignificant. Interestingly, the plasmon decay into
the hot-carriers saturates beyond 27 fs, and
justifies our simulation duration (30 fs). In
Figure 5 (a), the number of carriers generated
through each process is obtained by summing
the weighted transition probabilities. For example, the number of carriers involved in the
DHET
are computed
as: PeNP→PFOA (t)

The weighted transition probabilities can
also be used to obtain the energetic distribution of hot-carriers across the Fermi level.
For example, the energetic distribution of

curves represent the hot-hole and hot-electron
distributions, respectively. Clearly, the majority of the hot-electrons generated through the
DHET mechanism have energies around 3 eV
(i.e., they are highly energetic), and a few of
them have even energies close to the plasmon
resonance energy (3.83 eV). In contrast, the
majority of the hot-holes generated through
the DHET mechanism are within 1 eV from the
Fermi level. Similarly, among the hot-carriers
generated due to the NP → NP transitions
(lower panel of Figure 5 (b)), the majority of
the hot-electrons have energies closer to the
Fermi energy and hot-holes have energies of
about −4 eV.
Since the energetic distribution of hot-carriers
plays a crucial role in the hot-carrier-mediated
chemical reactions, it is essential to understand
the observed differences in the hot-electron and
hot-hole distributions. One of the primary
factors that strongly influences these distributions is the electronic structure of the complex.
Moreover, since the DHET mechanism involves
the transition of electrons from the occupied
orbitals of NP to the unoccupied orbitals of
PFOA, a careful examination of the positions
of occupied orbitals of NP and unoccupied orbitals of PFOA (that align with the plasmon
resonance energy 3.83 eV) will help us to comprehend the hot-carrier distribution. To this
end, we carefully examined the PDOS of the
NP-PFOA complex (Figure 1b). From the figure, it is evident that the unoccupied states of
the PFOA have larger densities between ∼1.251.75 eV and ∼2.5-3.5 eV. For the incident laser
pulse to create resonant transitions into these
unoccupied states, the corresponding occupied
orbitals of the NP must be located in the energy
ranges between -2.75 to -2.25 and -1.5 to -0.5
eV, respectively. Otherwise, the condition for
resonance will not be satisfied. Between these
two ranges, a larger number of NP density of
states are continuously available between -1.5
to -0.5 eV. Moreover, molecular orbital plots
(Figure S1) reveal the presence of several hybridized NP and PFOA states in this range,
which play a crucial role in plasmon dephasing through the direct charge transfer pathway.
Therefore, there is a greater probability for the

and hot-electrons in ∼3 eV range, respectively,
which is in agreement with the hot-carrier distribution depicted in the upper panel of Figure 5(b). A similar analysis will explain the
hot-electron transfer to PFOA at other energies and also the hot-carrier distribution due to
the NP → NP and DHHT transitions (for explanation, see section A of the supplementary
information).
Next, we provided the spatial distribution of
these excess-energy electrons and holes in Figure 5 (c). Specifically, we presented the distribution of carriers whose energies are (i) within 1
eV, (ii) > 1 eV, (iii) > 2 eV, and (iv) > 3 eV with
respect to the Fermi level. The corresponding
equations that we used to obtain these spatial
distribution plots are provided in section B of
the supplementary information. As depicted
in these figures, the electrons with energies between 0 to 1 eV are mostly localized on the NP.
In contrast, electrons with energies larger than
1 eV (hot-electrons) are delocalized over the entire NP-PFOA complex. Notably, some of the
highly energetic electrons (with energies greater
than 2 and 3 eV) are present all over the PFOA
molecule. This result not only establishes the
electron transfer from the NP to the PFOA but
also unambiguously demonstrates the transfer
of highly energetic hot-carriers (with energies
> 3 eV) to PFOA, which can readily dissociate
the strong C−F bonds of the PFOA molecule.
Importantly, several earlier ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have demonstrated
that PFAS molecules decompose in an ultrafast
manner in the presence of excess electrons. 80–83
Since plasmon decay transfers excess-energy
hot-electrons to PFAS, they will be much more
efficient at degrading PFAS compared to regular excess electrons. It should also be noted
that since the hot-electrons can have energies
only up to the plasmon resonance energy ω0 ,
we did not observe any electrons with energy
greater than 4 eV. Unlike hot-electrons, at all
energies, hot-holes are predominantly localized over the NP (except for a minute fraction

that can be seen near the oxygen atoms in the
PFOA molecule). Thus, our results indicate
that, in the absence of other external factors,
hot-electron transfer is the primary mechanism
through which a PFOA molecule will be degraded in the presence of a plasmonic NP.
Next, we analyzed the effects of field strength
and orientation of the PFOA molecule relative
to the NP. As shown in Figure 6, the hotelectron transfer from NP to PFOA increases
significantly at higher pulse intensities. Specifically, we observed several orders of magnitude
increment in the electron transfer by increasing the field strength from 0.514 mV/Å to 514
mV/Å. Moreover, the occupation probabilities
at different time scales clearly establish the fact
that the plasmon-dephasing before 11 fs is majorly occurring due to the NP → NP transitions,
whereas the dephasing at later timescales is also
influenced by the NP → PFOA (DHET) transitions. At the same time, the increase in intensity does not have any effect on the energy of the
generated hot-electrons. Overall, we find that
increasing intensity facilitates a larger amount
of hot-electron transfer from NP to PFOA, further promoting the efficient degradation of the
PFOA molecule.
For investigating the effects of PFOA orientation relative to the NP on the DHET mechanism, we considered two more orientations
(apart from the orientation that we considered in Figure 1(a), which we will refer to
as Interface-1.). We refer to the two new
orientations as Interface-2 and Interface-3, respectively (see the insets in Figures 6(d) and
6(e)). In Interface-1, the carbon chain of the
PFOA molecule is perpendicular to the diameter of the NP. In Interface-2, the carbon
chain of the molecule is parallel to the diameter of the NP, with the oxygen atoms positioned
near the nanoparticle. Interface-3 is similar
to Interface-2, except that the oxygen atoms
of the molecule are facing away from the NP
(i.e., the PFOA molecule is rotated by 180◦
compared to Interface-2). The photoabsorption spectra of these interfaces for applied electric fields polarized along the x and z-directions
are provided in Figures 6(d) and 6(e). No10

tably, the photoabsorption peaks of these interfaces remain unchanged with variations in
PFOA orientation, indicating the minimal effect of PFOA on the absorption spectrum of
the complex. Also, since the NP is isotropic,
the electric field polarizations did not create any
significant changes in the spectrum. The number of hot-carriers generated on the molecule
via DHET and DHHT processes in all three interfaces and for both x and z-polarized electric
fields is shown in Figure 6(f). The DHET is
found to be highest in Interface-1 under the zpolarized electric field. In contrast, DHHT is
polarization-independent and reaches its maximum in Interface-2.
Plasmon-induced degradation of PFAS.
Due to the substantial computational cost
associated with the Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations, we considered a
smaller NP (Ag55 ) for studying the degradation
dynamics of PFOA. Currently, with GPAW,
the EMD simulations can only be conducted
in the finite-difference TDDFT (FD-TDDFT)
method. Moreover, since this method is not
compatible with the Gritsenko, van Leeuwen,
van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation
(GLLB-SC) functional, we used the PBE functional in all our EMD calculations. For consistency, we used the same method to compute the
absorption spectrum of the Ag55 −PFOA complex. As shown in Figure S2, the Ag55 −PFOA
complex exhibits a plasmonic peak at 3.6 eV,
and the corresponding LSPR frequency is used
in our EMD simulations. To observe the
plasmon-induced molecular dissociation, earlier
theoretical studies have used the field intensities in the order of 1013 − 1015 Wcm−2 (1-10
V/Å). Following these works, we considered a
laser pulse (Eq. 1) with a field strength (ε0 ) of
1.0 V/Å and conducted the EMD simulations.
Figure 7a depicts the variation in the C−F
bond distances as a function of the simulation
duration. Below 50 fs, the C−F bond distances
were oscillating between ∼ 1.25 and ∼ 1.75
Å, i.e., across the C−F equilibrium bond distance (∼ 1.37 Å). After 50 fs, several of the
C−F bond distances increased beyond 2 Å, and
some of them even reached values up to 3.5
Å, providing direct evidence for the plasmon-

induced degradation of PFOA. Figure 7b shows
the NP−PFOA geometries at three different
time instances, namely, 0, 60, and 90 fs, where
the near complete degradation of PFOA can be
observed by 90 fs. Together, these results establish that the plasmon-induced DHET enables
the degradation of PFAS.

Conclusions. We reported the real-time evidence of plasmon-induced direct hot-electron
transfer from metal NPs to PFAS and provided
an atomistic understanding of this novel degradation mechanism. Through RT-TDDFT simulations, we established that plasmonic exci12

tation in Ag147 −PFOA complex occurs within
8-12 fs and decays into hot-carriers in an ultrafast (27 fs) manner through various decay
channels. Specifically, we showed that the
chemical interface damping facilitates the direct transfer of highly energetic hot-electrons
(up to plasmon resonance energy ω0 ) from NP
to PFOA with ∼ 7% probability in Ag147 -PFOA
and with ∼ 17% probability in Ag55 −PFOA.
These hot-electrons delocalize over the entire
PFOA molecule and enable the dissociation of
its strong C-F bonds. Among various modifications, we find that laser intensity can significantly enhance the amount of direct hotelectron transfer. These findings provide atomistic insights into plasmon-induced hot-carrier
dynamics in NP-PFAS complexes and establish a clear framework for leveraging plasmonic
systems to degrade harmful water pollutants.
By exploring different NP geometries, compositions, and adsorption sites, future studies can
further optimize these plasmonic hot-carrier
systems to drive advances in water treatment.
Methods.
All the ground state optimization calculations were performed using density functional theory along with the
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchangecorrelation functional, 84 as implemented in
the GPAW code 85,86 in conjunction with the
atomic simulation environment (ASE). 87 The
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS)
optimizer 88 was used for the geometry optimization. All the systems were considered to
be optimized when the maximum forces on
each atom were less than 0.01 eV/Å. In the
optimized NP-PFOA complex, the minimum
distance between the NP and PFOA (between
Ag and F atoms) was found to be around 3 Å. A
minimum of 6 Å vacuum was used in all directions to minimize the interaction between their
periodic images. A grid spacing of 0.2 Å and
double-zeta polarized (DZP) basis sets were
used.
The excited-state calculations were performed
using the RT-TDDFT formalism. The projector augmented-wave method was utilized to
represent the wave functions, employing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). 89
To properly describe the d-states in Ag atoms,

the Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and
Baerends solid correlation (GLLB-SC) 90,91
exchange-correlation functional was used in
these calculations. All the dynamical responses
were described using the random phase approximation (RPA). To reduce the computational cost while maintaining the numerical
accuracy, a grid spacing of 0.3 Å was used in
the time-dependent simulations. The photoabsorption spectra were obtained by considering
a Delta-kick perturbation. The strength of the
perturbation was kept small (0.514 mV/Å) to
ensure that the system remained in the linear
response regime. To obtain smooth photoabsorption spectra, a Gaussian broadening of 0.07
eV (with a full-width half maximum of 0.16 eV)
was used while conducting the Fourier transform of the dipole moment.
Next, we used a monochromatic ultrafast
Gaussian pulse of the form
2

ε(t) = ε0 cos(ω0 (t − t0 ))e−(t−t0 ) /τ

2

(1)

to excite the LSPR and to initiate the real-time
dynamics of electrons in NP-PFOA. With a
pulse duration of τ0 = 3 fs, the pulse frequency
ω0 was tuned to the plasmon resonance. Moreover, the pulse is centered at t0 = 10 fs, and
the pulse strength (ε0 = 0.514 mV/Å) was kept
small to keep the system in the linear response
regime. In all the real-time simulations, we used
a time step of 10 attoseconds with a total simulation duration of 30 femtoseconds. The pulse
convolution method implemented by Rossi et
al. 55 was used to obtain the time-dependent
density matrix, energy stored in the excited
state, and the other hot-carrier analysis. EMD
simulations were conducted with a monochromatic ultrafast Gaussian pulse of the form in
Eq. 1 and with a pulse strength of 1 V/Å for 90
fs duration with a time step of 10 as. Various
software packages, namely VMD, 92 VESTA, 93
NumPy, 94 and GRACE were used for visualization, data processing, and plotting.
