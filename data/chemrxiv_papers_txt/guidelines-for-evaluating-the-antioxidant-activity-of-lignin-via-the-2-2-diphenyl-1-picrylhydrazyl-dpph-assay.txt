ABSTRACT
The most widespread procedure to measure the antioxidant activity of lignin is via the 2,2diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. So far, different experimental procedures (i.e., different
solvent, time, etc.) have been used to implement the DPPH methodology without estimating the
effect of such modifications on the experimental procedure. To overcome this issue, the impact of
the solvent, the time, and the type of substrate on the evaluation of the antioxidant activity (AoA)
of lignin via the DPPH assay was investigated in this work. We found that multiple different
parameters affect the evaluation of the AoA of lignin: i) the stability of the DPPH radical and the
lignin solubility in a given solvent; ii) the importance of reaching steady state (the effect of time);

DPPH radical scavenging); iv) lignin structure; v) providing a normalized radical scavenging index
(nRSI); vi) comparing nRSI vs. inhibition percentage (IP) values. Overall, our investigation
allowed us to provide guidelines on how to perform the DPPH assay for a more reliable evaluation
of lignin AoA.

1. INTRODUCTION
Lignin is an aromatic biopolymer which constitutes 5–30 wt% of lignocellulosic biomass.[1] The
heterogenous lignin structure comprises mainly three types of phenylpropane units – i.e., phydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) – which are interlinked through ether linkages,
such as β–O–aryl units, and C–C bonds like β–β, β–5, β–1 and 5–5, among others.[2–5] In addition,
lignin boasts an abundance of different functionalities, such as phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyls
(PhOH and AliphOH), carboxylic (–COOH), carbonyl (CO) and methoxy (–OCH3) groups.[3]
The heterogeneity of lignin structure depends on the type of biomass and the processing
conditions used to extract/separate it. For instance, upon severe pulping conditions (i.e., Kraft
pulping), the lignin structure changes drastically, especially by the cleavage of β–O–4 linkages,
resulting in a decrease in molar mass and an increase in the amount of phenolic hydroxyl (PhOH)
and carboxyl (–COOH) groups.[3,4,6] Other examples of biorefinery processes are organosolv and
sulfite pulping. Organosolv pulping is a more recent method which allows for biomass
fractionation using an organic solvent as the reaction media.[7] Sulfite pulping involves the
chemical treatment of wood with SO2 in water under acidic conditions and high temperature. This
leads to the functionalization of lignin with sulfonic acid groups.[8,9] In addition, other emerging
types of biorefineries showed flexibility and tunability for lignin structure and properties.[10–12] It
is thus clear that the applied extraction process strongly affects the resulting lignin structure and
its properties.
The abundance of lignin as a by-/co-product in established pulping processes or emerging
biorefineries makes it an appealing substrate for various high value applications.[13] Currently,
lignin is mainly used as a low value on-site biofuel.[14] Other more valuable strategies to valorize
lignin are the production of biobased chemicals,[15,16] carbon fibers,[8] carbon foams,[17]

thermoplastics,[18] adhesives, and thermosetting resins,[19] among others. An interesting feature of
lignins is the presence of phenolic –OH groups (PhOH) that endow them with antioxidant
properties.[20] In detail, PhOH groups scavenge free radicals via an H atom donation and a
subsequent phenoxy radical stabilization.[21]
Among the available assays to evaluate the antioxidant properties of compounds (e.g., 2,2'azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid, ABTS; ferric ion reducing antioxidant
potential, FRAP),[22] the “free radical” (DPPH) method is widely accepted and used by many
researchers.[23] This relies on the calculation of the radical scavenging index (RSI; see
experimental and ESI). For instance, Brand-Williams et al. used this method to investigate the
antiradical activity of various phenolic compounds and different acids (ascorbic and iso-ascorbic)
by measuring the reaction kinetics.[24] The concept is based on the interaction between a stable
DPPH radical and a chosen scavenging substrate in solution. In other words, an anti-radical
(antioxidant) molecule can scavenge the free DPPH radical and quench it. Scheme 1 reports the
case of PhOH in the radical scavenge of DPPH radicals. In turn, the quenching capability of the
compound is evaluated by measuring the related decrease in UV absorption of DPPH over time.

Hence, AoA is best described as a kinetic parameter, meaning how fast rather than how many
(equilibrium) radicals are quenched over time.[25] This decay rate depends on the chemical
structure, implying that AoA is a very specific property of a given compound. However, the
evaluation of the AoA of lignin is a less trivial endeavor than it first appears as lignins and other
plant extracts are more complex than (phenolic) model compounds. In the case of lignin, factors
like heterogeneity, complexity, molar mass and molar mass distribution, and selective solubility
complicate the evaluation of its AoA. For example, in the DPPH assay, the solvent choice has a
big impact on the occurring reactions between lignin and DPPH. Different solvents interact in
different ways with different lignin functionalities, which in turn influences the radical quenching
kinetics. For all these reasons, the DPPH assay for lignin cannot determine the AoA (kinetic value)
but rather the content of "reductive species" or "reductive potential" of a given substrate, which is
generally defined as antioxidant capacity (AoC).[25,26] Nevertheless, since AoC is a more specific
and less widespread term than AoA, AoA will be interchangeably used through the text even when
referring to AoC. Overall, the AoA of lignin is often characterized by the radical scavenging index
(RSI), which is related to the concentration at which a lignin substrate is able to scavenge 50 % of
the initial DPPH radicals. This is also true for every other antioxidant assay used on lignins as
well, and not specific to the DPPH assay.
In light of these considerations, elucidation of lignin AoA needs to be performed via a thoughtful
(standardized) procedure and accompanied by a comprehensive structural characterization of
lignin to draw valid conclusions.[20] However, a standardized and universal procedure has not been
properly developed yet.[27,28] The reported RSI values of lignin were measured using (slightly)
different experimental procedures, which impairs the comparability of the obtained values. For
instance, solvents like aqueous dioxane/methanol,[29],[30] methanol (MeOH), [31] dimethyl sulfoxide

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-khsfs ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4063-1256 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

(DMSO),[32] and ethanol (EtOH)[33] have been used. In addition, the RSI values were measured at
different time frames, such as 15 min,[34] 30 min,[32], [35] and 24 h.[29] [36] In some cases, the authors
did not mention the time frame for the analysis.[37] A wider scope of lignin AoA is provided in
recent reviews.[38,39]
Overall, a standardized procedure that considers the influence of these parameters on the RSI
values is still missing. The aim of the current work is to provide reliable and comprehensive
insights into the effect of parameters, like the solvent, the time and the type of lignin
substrate/structure. In addition, we here give guidelines on the best practices to evaluate the AoA
of lignin via the DPPH assay. To the best of our knowledge, no similar works have been reported
so far. This work represents a step towards a universal method to investigate the AoA of lignin.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 Materials and chemicals
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) stable radical was purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific. Analytical grade methanol (≥99.8 %), dioxane (≥99.0 %), acetone (C3H6O, 95 vol%),
and α-tocopherol (vitamin E, ≥95.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Softwood kraft lignin
(Indulin AT) and Alcell are commercially available technical lignins. The other lignin substrates
were produced according to our previously reported procedures.[10–12,20]
2.2 The preparation of lignin substrates
For the current work, lignin samples of different origin and structure were selected (Table 1).
Lignin derivatization (S3–6, Table 1) was performed according to Diment et al.[20] Briefly, Indulin
AT underwent structural modifications by selectively acetylating (masking) all –OH groups with
acetic anhydride (S3, Table 1), methylating benzylic –OH and –COOH groups using acidic
methanol (S4, Table 1), methylating phenolic –OH groups with dimethylsulfide at 80 °C (S5, Table

1), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction of C=O groups of keto- and aldehyde-types (S6,
Table 1). One partially ethoxylated lignin sample was prepared as described by Rigo et al.[12] (S7,
Table 1). Two additional samples were prepared according to our recently reported biorefinery
procedure[10,40] (S8 and S9, Table 1). Further details on the sample preparations are reported in the
ESI.
2.3 AoA evaluation via the DPPH method
The antioxidant properties of the lignin samples were conducted according to Diment et al. with
certain adjustments.[20] The effect of time, solvent and lignin substrate was investigated.
2.3.1 Normalized radical scavenging method.
Lignin samples were dissolved in 90 vol% dioxane (aq.), 90 vol% MeOH (aq.), or 90 vol%
acetone (aq.) at different concentrations (0.12–0.6 mg mL–1). DPPH was dissolved in 99.8 vol%
MeOH, 90 vol% MeOH (aq.), 90 vol% acetone (aq.), or 90 vol% dioxane (aq.) at a concentration
of 76 μmol L–1. Then, 0.7 mL of the lignin solution was added to 27 mL of DPPH solution and
vigorously mixed. The proportion between the DPPH and lignin solutions was kept at 39:1 (v/v)
for all experiments. DPPH radical scavenging was determined by UV-VIS spectrometry as the
change in DPPH concentration over time (0, 5, 15, 30 min, and 1, 2, 6, 24, 48 h) (vide infra). The
rate of DPPH scavenging was determined by linearly fitting the first time points (5, 15, 30 min)
and the steady state of the reaction was defined as the maximum of scavenging curve.
Normalization accounted for the initial absorbance of the lignin solutions and the degradation of
DPPH over time in a blank sample. Further details on the calculations to evaluate the normalized
RSI (nRSI) of the lignin samples are reported in the ESI. The calculated nRSI values are based on
two replicated measurements.

2.4 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
Determination and subsequent quantification of various hydroxyl groups was performed by 31P
NMR according to our optimized method.[2] The spectra were recorded on a Bruker NMR
Spectrometer AV III 400 with an acquisition time set to 1 s, relaxation delay of 5 s, and number
of scans set to 128. Briefly, ca. 40 mg of each lignin sample was dissolved in a 0.4 mL of a freshly
prepared mixture of pyridine and CDCl3 (1.6:1, v/v). Following that, 100 μL of e-HNDI solution
(0.3 μmol mg–1) as an internal standard (IS) and 50 μL of chromium(III) acetylacetonate solution
(11.4 mg mL–1) were added. Lastly, 100 μL of derivatization agent (TMDP) was added and the
vial was vortexed until homogeneous before being transferred into an NMR tube. The resulting
spectra underwent phasing and calibration according to the signal of the 2,2′-oxybis(4,4,5,5tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane) water-derivatized product at 132.2 ppm. A linear function
was used for baseline correction.
2.5 UV-VIS spectroscopy
UV-VIS spectroscopy of the lignin:DPPH solutions was performed on an UV-2550 UV-VIS
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using 10 mm way length quartz cuvettes. The scavenging of
radicals leads to a shift in the UV-VIS spectra of DPPH, i.e., a decrease in absorbance at λ =
515 nm, which was thus selected as measurement wavelength.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of solvent, time and substrate on the
measurement of antioxidant properties of lignin. For this endeavor, a mixture of MeOH and 90
vol% dioxane (aq.) (39:1, v/v) and three different solvents (i.e., 90 vol% MeOH (aq.), 90 vol%
acetone (aq.), and 90 vol% dioxane (aq.)) were used, labeled solvent A, B, C, and D, respectively

3.1 Degradation of DPPH over time
The first issue to consider when evaluating the AoA via the DPPH method is the DPPH selfdegradation over the time.[43] Thus, prior to the evaluation of RSI, we investigated the DPPH selfdegradation in the different solvents of choice (Figure 1). Within the first 2 h, the degradation is
low in all solvents, while, after this time point, DPPH experienced a rapid degradation in solvent
D (dioxane-based) and a moderate-to-neglectable degradation in other solvents (A, B, and C).

Interestingly, DPPH was found almost fully stable in solvent C (acetone-based) with ca. 3 %
degradation over the 24 h period. The degradation in solvent B (MeOH-based) was 5 times higher
than in solvent C (15 %) after 24 h. These results are consistent with the ability of protic solvents
to transfer an H· radical when compared to aprotic solvents and, thus, promote DPPH quenching
(i.e., MeOH vs. acetone, respectively). The degradation in solvent D (dioxane-based) was found
to be the highest at ca. 70 %. A plausible path for the instability of DPPH in dioxane or its
mixture(s) may involve its reaction with peroxide species present in ethers.[44] The latter finding is
consistent with the higher value (20 %) achieved after 24 h in solvent A (MeOH+dioxane-based)
compared to B (MeOH-based).

Additionally, we studied the rate of DPPH degradation (Dr) in the used solvents (Table 2). We
report Dr as the slope of the fitting of the first three time points, where a linear correlation was
found (5, 15 and 30 min; Figure S2). As expected, Dr values followed the same trend as the DPPH
degradation after 24 h ranking the self-degradation in the order solvent D>A>B>C.

Our results demonstrate the importance of selecting an appropriate solvent and moreover,
correcting the radical scavenging index by the DPPH self-degradation over time (i.e., normalized
RSI, nRSI; see ESI for more details) is strongly recommended. We can, thus, express a corrected
DPPH absorbance (cDPPH𝑎𝑏𝑠 ) as:
cDPPH𝑎𝑏𝑠 = DPPH0 (absorbancet=0 ) − DPPHt (absorbancet=x )

(1)

Where DPPH0 is the initial absorbance and DPPHt is the absorbance at the time point of interest
(t = x). The cDPPH𝑎𝑏𝑠 has been used to evaluate the lignin AoA in the present work.
3.2 The effect of solvent
An additional important aspect to consider when determining the AoA of lignin is the possible
absorbance of certain lignin structures at the same wavelength of DPPH (λ = 515 nm). We
therefore measured the absorbance of each lignin substrate (𝐴𝑙 ) without the addition of DPPH in
the selected solvents (Table 2) at λ = 515 nm. The initial absorbance in the DPPH experiment (i.e.,
DPPH0 ) was then corrected by 𝐴𝑙 to eliminate bias due to the respective lignin’s absorbance at the
measurement wavelength (see ESI).

Table S3 and IP values in Figure S3.
Indulin AT (S1) and Alcell (S2) were selected to further investigate the effect of the solvent.
After 24 h of measurement time, the highest nRSI values were found for S1 and S2 in solvent B
(MeOH-based) and solvent C (acetone-based), respectively (Figure 2). It must be noted that S1
and S2 were not fully soluble in solvent B, thus the AoA was evaluated solely of the soluble part
(82 and 90 % for S1 and S2, respectively; see ESI and Table S3). In contrast, S1 and S2 were fully
soluble in all the other systems (Table S3), which further highlights the importance of selecting an
appropriate solvent. Incomplete dissolution complicates the interpretation of AoA, since we only

characterize a certain lignin fraction and not the whole sample. Thus, to draw consistent
conclusions, we compared the contents of –OH and –COOH groups present in the MeOH soluble
fractions (S1-sol and S2-sol) with S1 and S2 (Table 3, entries 1-4). As we recently reported,[20]
PhOH groups are the most important functional groups to determine the AoA of lignin. 31P NMR
analysis showed no significant difference in PhOH groups between S1 and S1-sol, thus the nRSI
was assumed not to be much affected by the incomplete dissolution. In contrast, S2-sol showed a
ca. 20 % decrease in PhOH content compared to S2 which suggests an underestimation of nRSI in
solvent B.

2.02 mmol g-1 were observed using solvent D for S1 and S2, respectively (i.e., a 65 and 84 %
decrease in nRSI compared to solvent B for S1 and S2, respectively). Overall, the observed trend
for nRSI values was B>C>A>D, so MeOH>Acetone>MeOH+dioxane>dioxane.
These results suggest that polar protic solvents such as MeOH provide higher nRSI compared to
polar aprotic solvents like acetone and dioxane. To explain these finding, we should consider the
two main scavenging mechanisms for plant antioxidants: proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET)
and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET).[34] In brief, PCET is solely governed by the
homolytic dissociation of the O–H bond of active –OH groups. The SPLET mechanism consists
of an initial proton loss followed by electron transfer. This mechanism is firmly favored in alkaline
conditions.[34] In both cases, phenolic protons are involved. The environment (solvent) can
influence the rate and type of reaction based on its polarity, ionization potential, pH, etc.[25,34] For
instance, in polar protic solvents, SPLET mechanism has been proven to exist.[25] In addition, it is
important to highlight that the solvent should ensure that the scavenging reaction proceeds
effectively, that the radicals are able to interact with the substrate while favoring mass transfer.
Consequently, the ability of polar protic solvents to facilitate the proton and electron transfer –
mass transfer – via SPLET mechanism is consistent with the higher nRSI values observed in
solvent B. Additionally, the possibility of MeOH to form H-bonds should be an additional aspect
to consider when explaining the higher nRSI.[25]
Comparing now solvent A and D (both dioxane-based) with solvent C (acetone-based) as polar
aprotic solvents, the differences in the nRSI can be associated with different polarity and the high
degradation of DPPH in solvent D, as discussed in the previous section. We also attribute the lower
nRSI values obtained in the dioxane-based solvents to the presence of peroxide reactive species in
ethers which somehow influence the radical scavenging.

Taking into account several factors such as solubility of the substrates, solvation effects, DPPH
degradation, IP development rate, solvent toxicity and the resulting nRSI values, we concluded
that the most efficient solvent for the determination of antioxidant properties using the DPPH assay
is solvent C (acetone-based).
3.3 The effect of measurement time
As mentioned in the introduction, the number of scavenged radicals and the rate of radical
scavenging depends on the type of substrate, the solvent, the temperature, the occurrence of side
reactions, and the self-degradation rate of DPPH. It is therefore of key importance to ensure that
steady state – the point when the amount of scavenged radicals does not change (thermodynamic
equilibrium) – is reached before evaluating the antioxidant properties.[24,25] Thus, the scavenging
reaction should be monitored over a sufficiently long time when determining the AoA of lignins.
In this part, S1 and S2 were used as substrates in solvent A, C and D (Figure 3 and 4). We
decided to not include solvent B due to the solubility issues we encountered, as discussed in the
previous section. In addition to nRSI values, the number of scavenged radicals over time (i.e.,
inhibition percentage, IP) was determined after 5, 15, 30 min, and 1, 2, 6, 24, 48 h, respectively,
since for complex samples such as lignins, IP might be considered an even better indicator of the
scavenging reaction compared to nRSI.
As expected, clear differences were found for the used solvents. In all solvents, the scavenging
activity within the first 5 min was very high (15–40 %) after which IP grew moderately for 6 h
(20–67 %) until a steady state was reached (Figure 4). For both substrates, steady state was reached
faster in solvent A (MeOH+dioxane-based) compared to solvent C (acetone-based) after 6 h and
10 h, respectively, while no clear steady state was observed in solvent D (dioxane-based) (Figure
3). As previously discussed, polar protic solvents such as MeOH facilitate radical scavenging, and
thus steady state was reached faster compared to aprotic solvents. In contrast, the presence of

peroxide reactive species in dioxane had a detrimental effect on the reaction due to enhanced
self-degradation of DPPH with time. This led to a decrease in the nRSI after reaching the steady
state (solvent A), or to the obscuring of a potential steady state (solvent D).

Linear fitting of the nRSI values between 5, 15 and 30 min – the timeframe where the trend is
linear (Figure 3) – allowed to determine the rate of the scavenging reaction (Rsc) in different
solvents (Figure 3d and Figure S5). Rsc represents how fast the radical scavenging of DPPH is
happening and, thus, provides kinetic information on the scavenging reaction. S1 and S2 showed

higher reaction rates in solvent A, followed by solvent C and lastly solvent D (7.5 and 4.9, 3.5 and
3.5, and 2.4 and 1.3 mmol g–1 t–1, respectively). Interestingly, no clear correlation was noticed for
the rate of DPPH degradation and the lignin-promoted rate of radical scavenging (vide infra). Since
both DPPH self-degradation and its scavenging by lignin are radical reactions, they were expected
to correlate with each other.

solvents, where ■ solvent A; ■ solvent C; ■ solvent D.
One should keep in mind that nRSI is a number which is calculated via a multi-step procedure.
In brief, nRSI is calculated as the inverse value of the effective concentration (EC50) of lignin,
normalized by the DPPH concentration (Eq. 2).
nRSI =

1
nEC50

(2)

Where nEC50 is the extrapolated lignin concentration at which 50 % of DPPH radicals were
scavenged, normalized by DPPH concentration. More details on all the calculations are reported
in the ESI. Therefore, its value can dramatically change even for small differences in IP values. In
other words, small differences (5 %) in the nRSI of different samples are generally within

experimental error. Therefore, we encourage to always compare both the nRSI and IP values to
have a more comprehensive picture of lignin AoA.
3.4 The effect of substrate and lignin structure
The influence of the lignin substrate on the radical scavenging relies on its structural peculiarities
affecting both the proton abstraction rate and the stability of the radical formed. Nine structurally
different lignin substrates were tested using the normalized RSI approach (Table S4). As discussed
in the previous section, solvent B was again not included in this part of the study, since the
solubility of S1 and S2 in the latter was not complete (see ESI). We ensured that steady state was
reached before providing the nRSI values (t = 24 h).

solvent D. Data and associated errors are also reported in Table S4.

In a previous study, we emphasized that PhOH play a preeminent role in the AoA of lignin,
while aliphatic −OH groups and −COOHs are detrimental to nRSI.[20] In addition, we found that
masking benzylic −OH groups (e.g., in β−O−4 structures) is detrimental for lignin AoA.[20] The
observed impact of the lignin structure on the AoA will be discussed in this context (compare
Tables 1 and 3, and Figure 4). Alcell (S2) showed the highest values followed by AqSO-lignin
(S9) and Indulin (S1), which is in line with their high PhOH groups content (4.00, 3.63, and
3.53 mmol g–1, respectively). Differences in AoA between S2, S9, and S1 can be further explained
by the number of aliphatic −OH groups which follow the trend S1>S9>S2 (2.49, 2.06, and
1.69 mmol g-1, respectively). This supports our recent findings on the detrimental effect of
aliphatic −OH groups on lignin AoA.[20] Modified Indulin lignin samples (S3–S6) with (partially)
masked benzylic –OH groups showed the expected decrease in AoA compared to unmodified
Indulin, regardless of the used solvent. We can thus corroborate our previous findings via an
updated methodology for nRSI evaluation.[20] The AquaSolv Omni (AqSO) biorefinery[10,11] lignin
samples (S7–9) exhibited remarkable differences, especially in solvent C. The ethoxylated sample
(S7) – mainly ethoxylated at the benzylic position[12] – showed the lowest AoA among them (S7–
9), once again in line with our previous findings on the detrimental effect of methylation of
benzylic –OHs.[20] The AqSO-lignin sample (S9) showed higher AoA compared to AqSO-LCC
(S8) which relies on the higher PhOH (beneficial) and lower aliphatic OH (detrimental) groups
content in S9 compared to S8.
An additional aim of this part of the work was to determine whether the nRSI of a lignin obtained
in different solvents are correlated, with the calculation of a conversion factor as the ultimate goal.
A conversion factor would help to roughly estimate the nRSI in different solvents for comparison
with literature values. However, we want to stress that measurement parameters are often not

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-khsfs ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4063-1256 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

20

ideally defined in literature and thus comparisons should be met with caution. In this work,
conversion factors have been calculated as the ratio of the nRSI values obtained in different
solvents:
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 =

𝑛𝑅𝑆𝐼𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑋
𝑛𝑅𝑆𝐼𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑌

(2)

An uncertainty associated with the conversion factors was calculated as well (see ESI).
Though the number of tested samples does not represent a statistical set, the calculated
conversion factors still allow for a rough comparison of nRSI obtained in different solvents with
uncertainties below 20 % of the conversion factors.

3.5 Vitamin E as a Standard Antioxidant
Vitamin E is a lipophilic antioxidant that plays imperative role in protecting cells from oxidative
stress caused by free radicals.[45] Vitamin E is widely used as an antioxidant in various industries
due to its ability to prevent oxidation, thus extending the shelf life and maintaining the high quality
of products.[45,46] Its antioxidant properties are of prime importance in food, cosmetics, and
pharmaceuticals sectors.[45] For all these reasons, we selected vitamin E as a standard antioxidant
to compare with our lignin samples. Solvent D was not considered due to the very high DPPH
degradation (see discussion in the previous sections). We included solvent B to make the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-khsfs ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4063-1256 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

21

discussion more comprehensive, even though we previously encountered solubility issues with the
lignin samples.
Vitamin E showed an extremely high IP rate in all solvents (Figure 7a). Steady state was reached
within the first 15 min of the reaction (ca. 24 times faster – on average – compared to lignin
samples), by inhibiting ca. 80 % of the DPPH radicals in solvent C and more than 95 % of the
DPPH radicals in solvents A and B (Figure 7a). This exemplifies why AoA is commonly defined
as a kinetic parameter for small molecules.[25] Especially the outstanding IP values in solvent B
are in good agreement with literature,[47–49] since MeOH as a polar protic solvent (solvent B)
facilitates the SPLET mechanism which results in a higher IP rate as well as in higher nRSI values
(Figure 7B).
As expected, the change in IP showed that the rate of radical scavenging for vitamin E is much
faster compared to lignin regardless of the used solvents (Figure 7a). For instance, vitamin E can
scavenge DPPH ca. 2.6 times faster than S1 when comparing their change in IP in solvent C
(compare Figures 7a and 4a). However, comparing the nRSI values of vitamin E and Alcell when
steady state was reached (15 min and 24 h for vitamin E and Indulin AT (S1) in solvent C,
respectively), a 15% higher nRSI value was found for the lignin sample (7.7 and 9.0 mmol g‒1 for
vitamin E and Indulin AT, respectively; Figures 2 and 7b, and Table S4). As discussed in the
introduction and throughout the text, we suggest considering both the nRSI values and the IP trends
over the time to draw more reliable and comprehensive conclusions on the AoA of lignin.
Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that certain lignin samples (e.g., S1 and S2) and vitamin E
work almost equally in the long run, eventually resulting in both high IP rates and nRSI values. In
addition, testing vitamin E proved the effectiveness of the developed procedure for nRSI
evaluation.

Overall, the rate of radical scavenging (kinetics) was the main difference between the best
performing lignin samples and vitamin E, while the differences in the total number of scavenged
radicals (thermodynamics) were less pronounced. One should consider that the importance of how
fast or how many radicals are quenched depends on the application the antioxidant is intended for.
For instance, in certain applications an active ingredient that prevents aging in the long term is
needed while in others quenching must be fast. Therefore, the discussed lignin behavior might be
exploited in long-lasting antioxidant formulations (i.e., coatings, paints, among others).

3.6 Guidelines for the evaluation of the AoA of lignin
After investigating the effect of multiple parameters on the calculation/evaluation of nRSI values
– and thus on the AoA of lignin – we here provide guidelines for performing the DPPH assay on
lignin samples.
-

DPPH degradation: DPPH stability in the chosen solvent significantly affects the nRSI
determination. Therefore, we suggest measuring the absorbance of the DPPH solution at the

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-khsfs ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4063-1256 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

23

starting time and at various time intervals to track any changes due to self-degradation. If the
degradation is higher than 20 %, we suggest using a different solvent or solvent system.
-

Lignin absorbance: lignin samples may show absorbance at the measurement wavelength
of DPPH (λ = 515 nm). For this reason, we suggest to always eliminate the lignin
“background noise” as discussed in section 3.2 and in the ESI.

-

Steady state: steady state is reached at different times in different solvents, which depend
on the rate of the scavenging reaction. We suggest to always monitor the reaction over a
longer timeframe to ensure steady state is considered when determining the nRSI. In
addition, our results suggest that the time needed to establish steady state is more dependent
on the solvent than on the substrate type.

-

nRSi vs. IP: nRSI is related to the amount of lignin needed to scavenge 50 % of the DPPH
radicals and is extrapolated following a multi-step procedure (see ESI). In contrast, IP
directly represents the number of scavenged radicals, which might be more representative
for complex samples such as lignins. In light of this, we suggest discussing and comparing
the IP and nRSI development over time to provide comprehensive information on the AoA
of a lignin sample.

-

Solvent: the used solvent plays crucial role in nRSI evaluation as it predetermines the DPPH
scavenging mechanism as well as the above-discussed rate of steady state establishment and
DPPH stability. An appropriate solvent for the experiment should provide excellent
solubility for both the lignin substrate and DPPH, and good stability of the radical in the
chosen solvent, while favoring the radical transfer. Among the used solvents, solvent C
(acetone-based) showed the most promising suitability for the evaluation of antioxidant
properties. Solvent C was particularly effective in maintaining DPPH stability, with minimal

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-khsfs ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4063-1256 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

24

degradation observed over a 24 h period. However, it cannot be ruled out that other solvent
systems exist that show an equal or even superior performance in fast and effective
antioxidant properties screening of lignin. Future studies could elaborate on this aspect to
further optimize the solvent composition.
-

Lignin structure: the structure of the substrate affects the scavenging rate by its ability to
form stable radicals and the presence/absence of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing
groups, as well as other intra- and inter-molecular interactions. In this study, all solvent
systems showed only a low to moderate impact of the substrate used compared to the effect
of other parameters (i.e., time, solvent, etc.). For all the tested lignin samples, AoA was
therefore better expressed as a thermodynamic value – amount of scavenged radicals at the
equilibrium (steady state) – rather than a kinetic one. On the other hand, as expected, small
molecules such as vitamin E show a different behavior and their AoA should be indicated as
a kinetic value.

-

In-vitro vs. in-vivo: the obtained nRSI values are only an indication and should not be taken
as an absolute value. The in-vitro – our study – DPPH assay is a good method to compare
and screen the AoA of several lignin samples. Nevertheless, we suggest using a combination
of both in-vitro and in-vivo tests to confirm the effectiveness of the lignin AoA. This aspect
will be investigated in a follow-up work.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Based on the classic DPPH assay, we provided a comprehensive evaluation of the dependance
of the calculated normalized radical scavenging index (nRSI) values – as an indication of the
antioxidant activity (AoA) of lignin – on different parameters, including the solvent, the
measurement time and the type of lignin substrate. Our results allowed us to provide guidelines

for evaluating the AoA of lignin via the DPPH assay and more reliably compare the properties of
different lignin samples. 90 vol% acetone (aq.) was found to be the most appropriate solvent based
on several important parameters, including complete solubility of lignin and DPPH, DPPH
stability, solvation effects, inhibition percentage (IP) development rate, solvent toxicity and the
obtained nRSI values. Additionally, it was highlighted that steady state establishment, and a low
DPPH degradation are important to accurately and consistently evaluate and compare lignin AoA.
Conversion factors to compare the nRSI values obtained for the same lignin samples in different
solvents have been proposed. Overall, for a more reliable evaluation and comparison of the
antioxidant properties of lignin samples, we suggest considering both the nRSI values and the IP
development over the time.
