Abstract

14

Numerous methods have been developed to address gaseous formaldehyde pollution,

15

but most of them cannot be applied directly to eliminate the pollution of formaldehyde in

16

aqueous solutions. Formaldehyde in aqueous solutions can be leached from

17

formaldehyde-containing solid materials (e.g., food, wood, clothes, resins) and

18

absorbed from gaseous formaldehyde by water. Here we developed an enzymatic

19

cleanup technique — the reconstitution of an enzyme cocktail consisting of three

20

coenzyme-free oxidoreductases (i.e., formaldehyde dismutase, methanol oxidase, and

21

formate oxidase) and catalase for the complete oxidation of formaldehyde. This enzyme

22

cocktail catalyzed the reaction of formaldehyde and dissolved dioxygen into carbon

23

dioxide (CO2) and water, which was demonstrated by the stable isotope tracer

24

technique. Significant levels of formaldehyde were detected from aqueous solutions

25

leached from the squid, pomfret, fabric, and curtain in the market. When this enzyme

26

cocktail was applied to treat the leachates of contaminated samples above,

27

formaldehyde was eliminated with degradation ratios of up to 100%. This enzymatic

28

cleanup technique, featuring excellent biosafety (for example, degradable catalysts and

29

non-immunogenicity), independence of light, high degradation ratios, and no special

30

equipment required, could be widely used to treat contaminated food, drinking water,

31

and formaldehyde-containing leachate.

Introduction

36

Formaldehyde, a feedstock chemical which is synthesized from methanol in industry

37

and produced endogenously by organisms, is ubiquitous.[1] This volatile organic

38

compound is widely used in chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, and wood industries.[2]

39

However, formaldehyde poses a severe risk to human health. The International Agency

40

for Research on Cancer has classified formaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen. [3]

41

Inhalation is the primary route of formaldehyde exposure for human. Formaldehyde can

42

induce coughing and rhinitis with a concentration as low as 0.1 ppm.[4] In addition,

43

formaldehyde has strong neurotoxicity and can induce central-nervous-system

44

disorders, such as headaches, sleep disturbances, and depression.[5] What’s worse, it

45

can cause DNA damage, increasing the risk of cellular transformation to cancer.[6]

46
47

The ubiquity of volatile formaldehyde has caused gaseous pollution concern of living

48

environments, such as residences, schools, vehicles, hospitals, and shopping malls.[7]

49

The predominant methods to eliminate gaseous formaldehyde can be categorized into

50

three main types: adsorption, catalytic oxidation, and biological removal (Table S1).

51

Adsorption is a widely-implemented method for the removal of gaseous formaldehyde. It

52

typically employs large surface-area porous materials, such as activated carbon,

53

ceramic honeycomb, and hydroxyapatite layer. [8] However, this method does not

54

degrade formaldehyde but sequesters it within the adsorbents, resulting in the possible

55

secondary pollution. Chemical oxidation of formaldehyde can be conducted by noble-

56

metal catalysts,[9] plasma,[10] and photocatalysts.[11] These chemical methods suffer from

57

the consumption of special chemicals and energy, poor biosafety, low efficacy, and/or

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

58

special equipment required. (3) Biological removal is of interests because some plants

59

and microorganisms can tolerate the toxicity of formaldehyde by assimilating or

60

decomposing it through complex metabolism.[12] However, organisms require specific

61

environmental conditions, special equipment such as the trickling biofilter bed, and

62

nutrients to support their lives.[13] In addition, the removal rates of most organisms are

63

too slow to efficiently eliminate formaldehyde within a short time.

64
65

The pollution of formaldehyde in aqueous solutions is ubiquitous, too, because it is

66

leached from formaldehyde-containing solid materials (e.g., resins, clothes, seafood,

67

wood), is absorbed from gaseous formaldehyde by water, and is released from

68

formaldehyde-saturated solid absorbents.[14] In the chemical industry, formaldehyde is

69

used to make phenolic resins, urea-formaldehyde (UF), urea–formaldehyde foam

70

insulation (UFFI), melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resins, and so on.[1] In the food

71

industry, some foods could generate formaldehyde during their storage and

72

transportation.[15] In addition, formaldehyde may be illegally added to prevent food from

73

spoilage.[16] Formaldehyde is also used in textile dying and anti-wrinkle treatments.[17]

74

Therefore, it is needed to address the pollution of formaldehyde in aqueous solutions

75

but current methods aiming at gaseous pollution cannot be applied directly.

76
77

Enzymatic cleanup technology is receiving more interests as a cost-effective solution to

78

the remediation of toxic pollutants in water,[18] especially when the production cost of

79

recombinant enzymes have been decreased greatly to a range of $10-30/kg of enzyme

80

dry weight.[19] Here we designed and developed a novel enzyme cocktail to oxidize

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

81

formaldehyde into CO2 and water (Figure 1A and 1B). This environment-friendly and

82

biosafety technique could have wide applications in the cleanup of formaldehyde in

83

aqueous solutions.

84
85

Results and Discussion

86

Design of the in vitro Enzymatic Pathway

87

The straightforward enzymatic method to degrade formaldehyde could be based on

88

formaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.46), glutathione-dependent formaldehyde

89

dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.1), and aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) (Table 1). These two

90

dehydrogenases consume costly NAD+ so that they cannot be widely used for

91

addressing environmental pollution.[20] Aldehyde oxidase is a molybdo-flavoenzyme that

92

strictly relies on the molybdenum cofactor, [2Fe-2S] cluster, and FAD.[21] Because this

93

enzyme’s catalytic activity for formaldehyde was not characterized and it was different

94

to be expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli, it cannot be widely used for pollution

95

control, too.

96
97

Formaldehyde dismutase (FDM, EC 1.2.98.1), a less-known oxidordeuctase containing

98

tightly bound NAD(H) as the prosthetic group, catalyzes the dismutation reaction of two

99

molecules of formaldehyde into formate and methanol.[22] Compared with the well-

100

known formaldehyde dehydrogenase, the reaction catalyzed by FDM is more

101

thermodynamically favorable and FDMs have very high specific activities of up to

102

thousands of units per milligram according to the records in BRENDA enzyme database

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

103

(Table 1). Furthermore, recombinant FDM that can be expressed well in E. coli is less

104

costly and lasts longer because it does not require exogenously-added NAD(H).[23]

105
106

To completely oxidize formaldehyde, we designed a novel in vitro enzymatic pathway

107

consisting of FDM, methanol oxidase (MOX), formate oxidase (FOX), and catalase

108

(CAT) (Figure 1A). The dual products of formaldehyde catalyzed by FDM were formate

109

and methanol. Subsequently, formate was oxidized into CO2 and hydrogen peroxide

110

(H2O2) in the presence of dioxygen, catalyzed by a flavoenzyme, FOX. Also, we chose

111

another flavoenzyme, MOX to oxidize methanol into formaldehyde and H2O2. CAT was

112

supplemented to decompose H2O2 into water and dioxygen, mitigating the toxicity of

113

H2O2. Through the iterative cycle of the four-step process, all formaldehyde can be

114

degraded into CO2 and water finally. This artificial enzymatic pathway has several

115

appealing features: (1) complete oxidation of formaldehyde with all irreversible

116

enzymatic reactions, (2) mild reaction conditions, (3) no costly exogenous-coenzymes

117

required, (4) neither energy (e.g., light, electricity, heat) nor special equipment required.

118
119

Mining and Characterization of Enzymes

120

FDM, MOX, and FOX from different organisms were heterologously expressed in E. coli

121

and CAT from bovine liver was purchased (Figure 1B). Molecular chaperones, GroEL

122

and GroES, were co-expressed with FDM from Pseudomonas putida to enhance the

123

soluble expression. SDS-PAGE and absorption spectra showed that the soluble FDM

124

was successfully expressed and purified (Figure S1).

126

To mine alcohol oxidase that catalyze the oxidation of methanol, we collated all alcohol

127

oxidase (EC 1.1.3.13) entries recorded in UniProt database and constructed a

128

phylogenetic tree after removing sequences with more than 90% identity. The majority

129

of alcohol oxidases exhibited high sequence similarity to those from methylotrophic

130

yeasts, such as Komagataella phaffii (Figure S2). We selected ten alcohol oxidases

131

from class A in the phylogenetic tree for further study and found that the one from

132

Phanerochaete chrysosporium can be expressed solubly in E. coli and possessed

133

desired catalytic activity (Figure S3).

134
135

FOX is a unique enzyme containing unusual autocatalytic-formation 8-formyl-FAD as

136

the prosthetic group.[24] In BRENDA enzyme database, it is listed under the aldehyde

137

oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) entry but possesses the distinctive catalytic activity of formate

138

oxidation.[26] Well-characterized FOXs were from Debaryomyces vanrijiae and

139

Aspergillus oryzae.[27] We selected FOX from A. oryzae for following study and it was

140

expressed well in E. coli (Figure S4).

141
142

The relative activities of FDM, MOX, and FOX from 20 to 60 °C showed that all three

143

mesophilic enzymes demonstrated optimal catalytic activities between 20-30 °C (Figure

144

1C). Subsequently, the optimal pHs of FDM, MOX, and FOX from 2 to 12 were studied

145

(Figure 1D). FDM had an optimal pH of 7 and retained significant activities at a broad

146

pH spectrum. MOX was an alkaliphilic enzyme with an optimal pH of 9, and lost all

147

activity below pH 5. FOX was a strictly acidophilic enzyme with an optimal pH of 5,

148

exhibiting 1.11% of its maximum activity at pH 7. Although there was a large difference

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

149

in the optimal pHs for the three enzymes, all of them had catalytic activities at pH 5-8

150

and the trade-off pH range of the three-enzyme cocktail was determined to be around

151

pH 7 (Figure 1E). Information of the enzymes that made up the cocktail and their

152

specific activities at pH 7 were summarized at Table 2. The specific activity of

153

recombinant FDM was 1.42 U/mg at 25 °C and pH 7, and was increased to 15.86 U/mg

154

in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+. The specific activity of recombinant MOX was 1.35 U/mg

155

at 25 °C and pH 7. The specific activity of recombinant FOX was determined to be 0.28

156

U/mg at 25 °C and pH 7. K+ should be avoided during the purification of FOX and

157

imidazole should be removed as clean as possible through ultrafiltration, because both

158

imidazole and K+ had significant inhibitions to FOX (Figure S5).

159
160

Proof-of-Concept Experiments: 13C Tracing and Time Profiles

161

The complete oxidation of formaldehyde was demonstrated by the stable isotope tracer

162

technique. 13C-labeled formaldehyde was used as the substrate and the enzymatic

163

products was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The

164

abundance of 13CO2 relative to normal 12CO2 in the products was 5.04% (Figure 2A),

165

significantly higher than the abundance of 1.17% in the ambient air (Figure S6). These

166

results demonstrated that 13C-labeled formaldehyde was successfully oxidated into

167

13CO

2 catalyzed by the four-enzyme cocktail.

168
169

Subsequently, we determined the time profiles of the formaldehyde degradation by high

170

performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In case of the four-enzyme cocktail, there

171

was a rapid decrease in the concentration of formaldehyde within the initial 10 minutes

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

172

of the reaction, followed by the slight increases in the concentrations of formate and

173

methanol. As the reaction proceeded, the concentration of formaldehyde continued to

174

decline and the concentrations of methanol and formate gradually decreased. Lastly,

175

the concentrations of formaldehyde, methanol and formate reduced to zero (Figure 2B).

176

As for the three-enzyme cocktail of FDM, FOX, and CAT, formate was effectively

177

converted to CO2, but methanol accumulated in the reaction system (Figure 2C, Figure

178

S7). Interestingly, we observed a very slow decrease in methanol, implying that FOX

179

could catalyze the oxidation of methanol due to its substrate promiscuity. In case of only

180

FDM, the trend of formaldehyde degradation was consistence with the formations of

181

methanol and formate (Figure 2D). Clearly, the complete oxidation of formaldehyde into

182

CO2 and water was implemented by the concerted action of the four enzymes.

183
184

Degradation Ratios of the Enzyme Cocktail

185

The concentration ratio of FDM, MOX, FOX, and CAT was optimized to be 1:1:6:5 in the

186

enzyme cocktail based on their specific activities. We tested three concentrations of the

187

enzyme cocktail for the degradation of 10, 100, and 1000 mg/L formaldehyde. At a low

188

enzyme loading (0.01 mg/mL FDM, 0.01 mg/mL MOX, 0.06 mg/mL FOX, and 0.05

189

mg/mL CAT), the formaldehyde degradation ratios for the concentrations of 10, 100,

190

and 1000 mg/L reached 93.8%, 98.6%, and 89.4%, respectively, after four hours

191

(Figure 3A). When the enzyme loading was increased by 10-fold, the degradation ratios

192

reached more than 90% after one hour and 100% after four hours regardless

193

formaldehyde concentrations (Figure 3B). At the highest enzyme loading (increased by

194

5-fold further), one-hour reaction was sufficient to reach degradation ratios of 95% for

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

9

195

the formaldehyde concentrations from 10 to 1000 mg/L, and the degradation ratios

196

reached 100% after two or four hours (Figure 3C). These results demonstrated that the

197

enzyme cocktail was capable of degrading formaldehyde of high (1000 mg/L) and low

198

(10 mg/L) concentrations with the degradation ratios of up to 100% within four hours.

199
200

Applications in the Leachates of Everyday Samples

201

The enzyme cocktail can be applied to everyday samples, such as seafood and textiles

202

(Figure 4A). Formaldehyde was detected in two aquatic products (i.e., squid and

203

pomfret) and two textile products (i.e., fabric and curtain) among the seven kinds of

204

samples purchased from the online market (Figure 4B), suggesting that formaldehyde

205

pollution was almost everywhere. Significant formaldehyde was not detected from the

206

latex paint here. This could be possibly attributed to the presence of some constituents

207

in the paint that can inhibit the colorimetric reaction of the acetylacetone assay.

208
209

The concentrations of formaldehyde in the leachates of the four formaldehyde-

210

containing samples were approximately one mg/L (Figure 4C). Formaldehyde in the

211

squid and pomfret might be added by the merchants to prevent spoilage or

212

spontaneously generated during their storage and transportation. Formaldehyde in the

213

fabric and curtain came from various industrial agents used in textile production. As for

214

the curtain, 4.4 g of it was cut out to extract the formaldehyde in 1.5 L of water. The

215

formaldehyde concentration of the leachate was 1.02 mg/L, which meant the

216

formaldehyde content of the curtain was as high as 0.35 mg/g. This alarmingly-high

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

10

217

content of formaldehyde likely had a significant health hazard to humans without special

218

treatment.

219
220

The enzyme cocktail (i.e., 0.1 mg/mL FDM, 0.1 mg/mL MOX, 0.6 mg/mL FOX, and 0.5

221

mg/mL CAT) was added to the leachate of formaldehyde-containing samples. After four-

222

hour reaction, formaldehyde concentrations of the pomfret and fabric were undetectable

223

(below 0.01 mg/L), while the formaldehyde concentrations of the squid and curtain

224

dropped to 0.02 and 0.10 mg/L, with the degradation ratios of 98.2% and 90.5%,

225

respectively (Figure 4C). These results demonstrated that the enzyme cocktail can

226

effectively degrade formaldehyde in the leachate of seafood and textiles, implying its

227

great potential to eliminate formaldehyde pollution in aqueous solutions.

228
229

Environmental Implications and Outlooks

230

To clean up ubiquitous pollution of formaldehyde in aqueous solutions, such as

231

contaminated food that was illegally-added formaldehyde and spontaneously generated

232

formaldehyde, formaldehyde-containing leachate from textiles and plastic-resin

233

containers, drinking water, and so on, we designed and constructed an enzyme cocktail

234

consisting of three coenzyme-free oxidoreductases (i.e., formaldehyde dismutase,

235

methanol oxidase, and formate oxidase) and catalase for the complete oxidation of

236

formaldehyde (Figure1). The stable isotope tracer technique and time profiles

237

demonstrated that formaldehyde can be successfully oxidized into CO2 and water by

238

the enzyme cocktail (Figure 2). Within a short time (one to four hours), the enzyme

239

cocktail enabled to efficiently eliminate formaldehyde of different concentrations (from

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4fjn2-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-3250-4252 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

11

240

10 to 1000 mg/L) and formaldehyde in the leachate of contaminated seafood and

241

textiles (approximately one mg/L) (Figure 3 and 4).

242
243

As compared to microbial remediation, the enzymatic cleanup technology received less

244

attention possibly because of costly enzyme preparation. Recent advances in low-cost

245

high-density fermentation,[28] recombinant protein expression,[29] and large-scale

246

commercialization of enzymatic biocatalysis for 10,000-ton production of inositol,[30]

247

suggest that enzyme costs (e.g., $10-30/kg dry weight) are not a show-stopper for

248

enzymatic pollution cleanup anymore.[19] As compared to one-enzyme-based cleanup

249

techniques that cannot catalyze complicated biological reactions,[31] this cascade-

250

enzyme technique enabled to completely oxidize formaldehyde into CO2 and water. It

251

was notable that FDM contained tightly bound NAD(H) as a stable prosthetic group,

252

different from dehydrogenases that used dissociated NAD+ as a coenzyme.

253

Furthermore, all the enzymes in this cocktail did not require costly and labile

254

exogenously-added coenzymes, implying that this enzymatic cleanup technique could

255

be widely applied to clean up formaldehyde in contaminated food, drinking water, and

256

formaldehyde-containing leachate.

257
258

This study demonstrated the technological feasibility and environmental cleanup

259

effectiveness of this enzyme cocktail to eliminate formaldehyde in aqueous solutions. In

260

the future, this enzyme cocktail could be formulated into a food detoxication agent for in

261

situ degradation of formaldehyde that was spontaneously generated during the storage

262

and transportation of them. It could also be developed into a formaldehyde-degrading

263

spray, specifically for the dry clothing and curtain treatment. Compared to current

264

methods, this enzyme cocktail possesses unique advantages, such as excellent

265

biosafety, independence from light or other energy sources, and no special equipment

266

required. Future endeavors could be conducted to improve this technique through

267

enzyme engineering and immobilization.

268
269

Conclusion

270

Formaldehyde in aqueous solutions poses a severe risk to human health but current

271

methods aiming at gaseous pollution cannot be applied directly to treat it. Significant

272

formaldehyde was detected from the leachates of seafood and textiles purchased from

273

the market. A novel coenzyme-free enzyme cocktail, consisting of FDM, MOX, FOX,

274

and CAT, was designed and developed in this study. This enzyme cocktail can catalyze

275

the complete oxidation of dissolved formaldehyde in the presence of dioxygen, which

276

naturally exists in the surroundings. Therefore, this enzymatic cleanup technique could

277

have wide applications in eliminating formaldehyde in aqueous solutions.

292

turn into the green radical (Figure S8). 5 mM ABTS and 10 U/mL HRP were added to

293

the samples. Then the absorbance at 405 nm was measured by spectrophotometer of

294

310

turbidity after the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 412 nm by the microplate

311

reader of Infinite M Nano (Tecan, Switzerland). The background absorbance of the

312

sample and CAT was taken into account and subtracted.

314

HPLC Analysis

315

HPLC analysis was performed on the LC-20 system equipped with differential refractive

316

index detector (Shimadzu, Japan) and the column of Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad,

317

Hercules, CA, USA). Formaldehyde, methanol, and formic acid were isolated and

318

quantified (Figure S11). The mobile phase was sulfuric acid aqueous solution of 5 mM,

319

the column temperature was 30 °C, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The column

320

temperature of 35 °C and higher flow rates (below 0.7 mL/min) were also feasible. Each

321

sample was measured for 25 minutes. The background of impurities was taken into

322

account and subtracted.

Expression and Purification of Enzymes

325

The gene encoding formaldehyde dismutase (FDM) from P. putida was synthesized by

326

Genewiz (Suzhou, China), integrated into pET-20b(+) vector, and transformed into E.

327

coli BL21(DE3)-GroES/L, which is capable of expressing the molecular chaperones

328

GroES and GroEL.[23] The gene encoding methanol oxidase (MOX) from P.

329

chrysosporium was synthesized by SiBio (Suzhou, China), integrated into pET SUMO

330

vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3).[32] The gene encoding formate oxidase

333

sequences of recombinant enzymes (Table S2) and optimized DNA sequences

334

encoding them (Table S3) can be found at supporting information.

335
336

The recombinant E. coli strain expressing FDM was cultured in TB medium

337

supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/mL) at 37 °C and

338

260 rpm. When the OD600 reached 0.8, 0.1 mM IPTG was added to it. The culture was

339

continued at 20 °C and 200 rpm for 12 h, and then harvested by centrifugation. The

340

obtained cell pellet was washed by using normal saline, and then suspended in NaPi

341

buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2, with 100 mM NaCl). Cell lysate was obtained by using high

342

pressure homogenizer of AH-1500 (ATS, Suzhou, China) and centrifuged for 30

343

minutes at 4 °C and 20,000 g. The supernatant was loaded to a Ni-NTA column pre-

344

equilibrated by NaPi buffer. Proteins were eluted in sequential steps by NaPi buffer (20

345

mM, pH 7.2, with 100 mM NaCl) containing 50 mM, 200 mM, and 500 mM imidazole,

346

respectively. FDM in the eluted fraction was concentrated and desalted by ultrafiltration

347

of Millipore (10 kDa cut-off). Protein concentration was determined via Bradford assay.

348
349

The preparation procedures of MOX and FOX were similar to that of FDM and were not

350

reiterated here. The concentration of kanamycin in the medium was 50 μg/mL.

351
352

Enzyme Characterization Methods

353

The specific activity of FDM was determined via AHMT assay. The reaction mixture was

354

prepared in glass tubes, containing buffer, 0.03 mg/mL FDM, and 1.5 mM

355

formaldehyde. The mixture was shaken for 10 minutes and the concentration of

356

formaldehyde was determined. The specific activity of MOX was determined via HRP-

357

ABTS assay. The reaction mixture was prepared in quartz cuvettes, containing buffer,

358

10 U/mL HRP, 5 mM ABTS, 10 μg/mL MOX, and 20 mM methanol. The change of

359

absorbance at 405 nm within 1 min was determined. The specific activity of FOX was

360

determined via HRP-ABTS assay, too. The reaction mixture was prepared in quartz

361

cuvettes, containing buffer, 10 U/mL HRP, 5 mM ABTS, 10 μg/mL FOX, and 20 mM

362

sodium formate. Then the change of absorbance at 405 nm within 1 min was

363

determined.

364
365

The specific activities of FDM, MOX, and FOX were determined at temperatures of 20,

366

25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 °C to find the optimal temperatures. The method to

367

determine the optimal temperature of MOX was modified following the procedure

368

described above. Here the reagent of ABTS assay consisted of NaPi buffer (100 mM,

369

pH 7), 20 U/mL HRP, and 10 mM ABTS. The reaction mixtures contained glycine buffer

370

(50 mM, pH 9), 1 μg/mL MOX, and 20 mM methanol. The mixtures were shaken for 30

371

minutes in the metal bath at temperatures of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 °C,

372

respectively. The reactions were terminated by placing on the ice. 100 μL of the assay

373

reagent was added to each 100 μL of the mixtures in the 96-well plate. The plate was

374

shaken for one minute and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm by the microplate

375

reader of Infinite M Nano (Tecan, Switzerland). The method to determine the optimal

376

temperature of FOX was similar to that of MOX via modified HRP-ABTS assay. The

377

reaction mixtures contained acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 5), 0.2 μg/mL FOX, and 20 mM

378

sodium formate.

379
380

The optimal pHs of FDM, MOX, and FOX was determined by using Britton-Robinson

381

buffer.[34] Britton-Robinson buffer contained phosphoric acid, boric acid, and acetic acid

382

of 40 mM and was adjusted to various pHs (2 to 12) by NaOH. The specific activities of

383

FDM, MOX, and FOX were determined in Britton-Robinson buffer of pH 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

384

8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 to find the optimal pHs.

385
386

The trade-off pH of FDM, MOX, and FOX was determined within pH 5 to 8. The reaction

387

mixtures were prepared in glass tubes, containing 50 mM NaPi buffer of various pHs

388

(i.e., 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5), 0.1 U/mL FDM, 0.1 U/mL MOX, 0.1 U/mL FOX, and 1.3

389

mM formaldehyde. The specific activities of enzymes here referred to the activities at

390

their optimal pHs. The reaction was performed at 25 °C and 800 rpm for one hour. The

391

concentration of H2O2 in the mixture was determined via HRP-ABTS assay.

392
393

Stable Isotope Tracer Method

394

The reaction mixture was prepared in a sealed glass vial equipped with a rubber

395

stopper, containing NaPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7), 10 mM 13C-labeled formaldehyde, 0.04

396

mg/mL FDM, 3.6 mg/mL FOX, 0.6 mg/mL MOX, 0.1 mg/mL CAT. Then it was shaken

397

for three hours at room temperature. NaOH solution was added by a syringe to

398

terminate the reaction and absorb CO2. Barium hydroxide solution was added to obtain

399

the precipitate of barium carbonate. Then hydrochloric acid was added to the precipitate

400

after it was transferred to another sealed container, and the generated CO2 was

401

collected in gas container. The enzymatic CO2 was analyzed by GC-MS system of

402

TRACE 1300 and ISQ 7000 equipped with electron impact ion source (Thermo Fisher

403

Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). CO2 in the ambient air was also analyzed by GC-MS as

404

a control.

405
406

Determination Methods of Time Profiles

407

The formaldehyde solutions were prepared by diluting commercial formaldehyde

408

solution, and the amount of methanol in the commercial solution, which was added to

409

prevent the oligomerization of formaldehyde, was determined to be 30%(mol/mol) by

410

HPLC. All experiments were performed in the closed glass tube in order to prevent the

411

volatilization of formaldehyde.

412
413

The reaction mixture for determining the time profile catalyzed by the four-enzyme

414

cocktail was prepared in glass tubes, containing NaPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7), 10 mM

415

formaldehyde, 0.04 mg/mL FDM, 3.6 mg/mL FOX, 0.6 mg/mL MOX, and 0.1 mg/mL

416

CAT. Then it was shaken at 25 °C and 800 rpm. The mixture was sampled after 10, 20,

417

40, 80, and 120 minutes, respectively. The concentrations of formaldehyde, methanol,

418

and formate in the samples were determined by HPLC.

419
420

The determination procedure of the time profile catalyzed by the there-enzyme cocktail

421

(i.e., FDM, FOX, and CAT) was similar to that of the four-enzyme cocktail but the

422

reaction mixture did not contain MOX.

423
424

The reaction mixture for determining the time profile catalyzed by only FDM was

425

prepared in glass tubes, containing NaPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7), 10 mM formaldehyde,

426

and 0.04 mg/mL FDM. Then it was shaken at 25 °C and 800 rpm. The mixture was

427

sampled after 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 min, respectively. The concentrations of

428

formaldehyde in the samples were determined via acetylacetone assay. The

429

concentrations of formate and methanol were equal to half of the reduction of

430

formaldehyde concentration.

431
432

Determination Methods of Degradation Ratios

433

The formaldehyde degradation ratios under various conditions were determined under

434

the catalysis of the four-enzyme cocktail. Three enzyme loadings were tested. The low

435

enzyme loading was 0.01 mg/mL FDM, 0.01 mg/mL MOX, 0.06 mg/mL FOX, and 0.05

436

mg/mL CAT; the middle loading was 0.1 mg/mL FDM, 0.1 mg/mL MOX, 0.6 mg/mL

437

FOX, and 0.5 mg/mL CAT; and the high loading was 0.5 mg/mL FDM, 0.5 mg/mL MOX,

438

3.0 mg/mL FOX, and 2.5 mg/mL CAT.

439
440

All experiments were performed in the closed glass tube in order to prevent the

441

volatilization of formaldehyde. The reaction mixtures were prepared in glass tubes

442

containing NaPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7), enzymes of different loadings, and various

443

concentrations of formaldehyde (i.e., 10, 100, and 1000 mg/L). Then the mixtures were

444

shaken at 25 °C and 800 rpm and were terminated after one hour, two hours, and four

445

hours, respectively. The residual concentrations of formaldehyde were determined via

acetylacetone assay. The formaldehyde degradation ratio was defined as the ratio of

447

the concentration reduction relative to the initial concentration.

448
449

Effect Tests on Everyday Samples

450

Seven kinds of seafood, textiles, and paint were randomly purchased from the market.

451

The seafood samples were thawed and extruded to collect the leachate. The textile

452

samples were soaked in water at the ratio of 3 to 110 g/L for one hour to collect the

453

leachate. The latex paint was diluted 50 times with water and then centrifuged to collect

454

the leachate. The concentrations of formaldehyde in these leachates were determined

455

via acetylacetone assay.

456
457

Treatments were performed in the closed glass tube in order to prevent the volatilization

458

of formaldehyde. The enzyme cocktail, comprising 0.1 mg/mL FDM, 0.1 mg/mL MOX,

459

0.6 mg/mL FOX, and 0.5 mg/mL CAT, was added to the leachates above in glass tubes.

460

The mixtures were shaken at 25 °C and 800 rpm for four hours. The concentrations of

461

formaldehyde were determined via acetylacetone assay before and after reactions.
