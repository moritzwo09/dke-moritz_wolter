Abstract

21

Plastics have become indispensable in modern industries; however, their resistance to natural

22

degradation poses environmental challenges. Biological degradation technologies employing

23

microorganisms offer promising solutions. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteome

24

of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a plastic-degrading microorganism found in the gut of

25

superworms, to identify the genes and enzymes upregulated during polyethylene degradation.

26

Functional analyses of these upregulated genes and enzymes using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of

27

Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology databases revealed an increase in lipid and

28

hydrophobic amino acid metabolism, suggesting their involvement in polyethylene degradation.

29

Based on these analyses, we identified phenylalanine monooxygenase, which is capable of

30

oxidizing plastics, and isocitrate lyase, which is involved in C-C bond cleavage. To investigate

31

the involvement of these enzymes in polyethylene degradation, phhA and aceA were

32

transformed into Escherichia coli, and the enzymes were produced and purified. The purified

33

enzymes were then reacted with polyethylene and analyzed. The results revealed the formation

34

of hydroxyl (-OH) and C-O groups on the polyethylene surface after treatment with

35

phenylalanine monooxygenase, confirming its ability to oxidize polyethylene. Isocitrate lyase

36

alone did not affect polyethylene production; however, when combined with phenylalanine

37

monooxygenase, it contributed to a reduction in molecular weight. This suggests a two-stage

38

process of polyethylene degradation involving oxidation and depolymerization that requires

39

sequential action of multiple enzymes. Thus, we identified the enzymes involved in each stage

40

and demonstrated the degradation ability of polyethylene using purified enzymes.

41

Synopsis: Polyethylene is the most commonly used plastic; however, its degradation

42

mechanism remains unclear. This study revealed a two-step process involving oxidation and

43

depolymerization during polyethylene degradation. Furthermore, enzymes involved in each

44

stage were identified.

1. Introduction

46

Plastics are widely used in various industries because of their light weight, durability, and

47

affordability. Despite the annual production of approximately 380 million tons of plastic, the

48

recycling rate is approximately 9% 1. Consequently, plastics introduced into the soil and oceans

49

undergo degradation, leading to microplastic pollution 2. Polyethylene accounts for 36% of the

50

overall plastic composition and contributes significantly to plastic pollution 3.

51

Biological degradation of plastics has attracted growing interest. This process is performed

52

at room temperature and pressure, making it environmentally friendly. Recent studies have

53

highlighted the ability of microorganisms to degrade plastic 4, 5. However, the efficiency of

54

microbial degradation in addressing plastic pollution remains relatively low.

55

One of the challenges in the biological degradation of plastics lies in their exceptionally high

56

molecular weight, which hinders their transport into cells. Generally, substances with

57

molecular weights below 500 Da can be transported into cells, whereas commercially used

58

polyethylene has a molecular weight of approximately 200,000 Da. Consequently, for

59

microorganisms to break down polyethylene, they need to secrete extracellular polyethylene-

60

degrading enzymes and transport the resulting degradation intermediates into the cell to serve

61

as an energy source 6.

62

The degradation of polyethylene is challenging because of its exclusive composition of

63

carbon and hydrogen, necessitating the involvement of multiple enzymes for effective

64

degradation 7. Initially, oxidoreductases act on polyethylene, initiating the formation of

65

oxygen-containing functional groups. Subsequently, depolymerizing enzymes come into play

66

in the second step, resulting in a reduction in molecular weight 8. Microbial oxidases, such as

67

alkane monooxygenase and cytochrome P450, are involved in initial oxidation 9, 10, 11. Esterases,

68

such as lipases, are presumed to be involved in the depolymerization process. Unlike polyester

69

plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene consists of C-C bonds, posing a

70

challenge for depolymerization by esterases 8, 9. Lyases, which can break bonds through

71

mechanisms other than hydrolysis, can also cleave C-C bonds. Therefore, lyases have the

72

potential to serve as depolymerization enzymes for polyethylene cleavage.

73

To enhance the effectiveness of plastic degradation, a comprehensive understanding of the

74

mechanisms underlying plastic degradation and identification of pertinent enzymes are

75

essential. Enhancing plastic degradation efficiency involves the discovery and optimization of

76

enzymes involved in the process 12. Recent studies have employed proteomic analysis to

77

unravel microbial polyethylene metabolic pathways and their correlations with lipid

78

metabolism 13, 14. However, exploration of plastic-degrading enzymes using multiomics

79

techniques, along with subsequent molecular biology approaches for expression and functional

80

analyses, remains relatively limited.

81

In this study, we investigated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is known for its capacity to

82

degrade polyethylene, with three main objectives: 1) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of

83

the transcriptomics and proteomics of P. aeruginosa to identify candidate genes involved in

84

plastic degradation.; 2) to produce and purify proteins from the selected genes using gene

85

cloning; and 3) to assess the plastic degradation ability of the enzyme at the molecular level.

86

Through these steps, we aimed to uncover the enzymes associated with polyethylene

87

degradation and elucidate the mechanism of polyethylene degradation.

2. Materials and Methods

89

2.1 Polyethylene Degradation by P. aeruginosa

90

2.1.1. Cultivation of P. aeruginosa using polyethylene as the carbon source

91

P. aeruginosa was cultivated using low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as the carbon source.

92

P. aeruginosa was inoculated into LB medium and cultured for 24 h in a shaking incubator

93

(28 °C, 130 rpm). After centrifuging 1 mL of the culture (13000 rpm, 5 min), a cell pellet was

94

obtained. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of liquid carbon-free basal medium (LCFBM)

95

and subjected to additional centrifugation to eliminate residual nutrients. This washing

96

procedure was repeated thrice. Subsequently, cells were cultured in 25 mL of LCFBM

97

containing 0.4 g of LDPE (weight-average molecular weight [Mw] ~4,000 and number-average

98

molecular weight [Mn] ~1,700, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) as the exclusive carbon source.

99

Inoculation was performed at a 1/100 dilution based on an OD of 1.0. After a 7-day incubation

100

period, the polyethylene degradation capability of P. aeruginosa was assessed.

101

2.1.2. Colony-forming units (CFU) counting

102

To verify microbial proliferation using LDPE as the carbon source, CFU were quantified.

103

One milliliter of culture sample was combined with 9 mL of LCFBM. Following six

104

consecutive dilutions of this solution, 100 µL was spread on LB agar plates and incubated for

105

24 h. CFU/mL was calculated by counting the number of colonies in the diluted solutions.

106

2.1.3. Weight-loss measurement

107

The dry weights of the plastics were measured to evaluate LDPE biodegradation. After

108

cultivation, the plastics were collected using a cell strainer (pore size: 40 μm, SPL, Korea) and

109

subjected to an overnight treatment with 2% SDS to eliminate microorganisms adhered to the

110

plastic surface. Subsequently, the plastics were thoroughly washed twice with deionized (DI)

111

water and oven-dried at 60 °C for 24 h.

112

2.1.4. SEM imaging

113

To conduct SEM imaging and FT-IR, XPS, and contact angle analyses, plastic films are

114

required. The LDPE films (density: 0.93 g/cm3) were cut into 2×2 cm pieces. Subsequently,

115

the films were subjected to the cultivation method outlined in Section 2.1.1. The surface

116

characteristics of the LDPE films were examined using field-emission SEM (Merlin Compact,

117

Zeiss, Germany). The films were securely affixed with carbon tape and coated with platinum,

118

and SEM images were captured. Biofilm formation and corrosion of the film surface were

119

evaluated using SEM to assess the biodegradation capabilities of the candidate plastic

120

degraders.

121

2.1.5. ATR FT-IR spectroscopy

122

The LDPE film was subjected to a 24-hour treatment with 2% SDS and washed with DI

123

water to eliminate the biofilm. To assess the changes in the chemical structures of the LDPE

124

films, an ATR FT-IR spectrometer (iS50, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) was used to

125

examine alterations in the functional groups. The FT-IR analysis employed single-bounce

126

attenuated total reflection spectroscopy, covering wavenumbers from 400 to 4,000 cm-1.

127

2.1.6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

128

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo Electron, MA,) was used to

129

analyze the elements and binding energies on the surface of the LDPE film. The samples were

130

secured with carbon tape and subjected to measurements in the energy range of 276–300 eV

131

for the C1s scan and 0–1,350 eV for the survey scan.

132

2.1.7. Contact angle analysis

133

Contact angle analysis was conducted to assess changes in surface hydrophilicity resulting

134

from LDPE degradation. The film samples were prepared by fixing both edges of the LDPE

135

films to a glass slide with cellophane tape. Approximately 15 μL of water was then applied to

136

the surface using a contact angle analyzer (Phoenix 300, SEO, Suwon, Korea). Measurements

137

were taken at three different locations and the average values were calculated

138

2.2. Transcriptomic Analysis of P. aeruginosa during Polyethylene Degradation

139

2.2.1 mRNA sequencing

140

To unravel the alterations in the transcriptome during polyethylene biodegradation, P.

141

aeruginosa was cultured in minimal media with LDPE as the carbon source for 7 days, and

142

subsequently, RNA sequencing was performed. The control group consisted of P. aeruginosa

143

cultured in LB for the same duration of 7 days. Total RNA concentration was calculated using

144

Quant-IT RiboGreen (Invitrogen, CA) and the integrity of the total RNA was assessed. Only

145

high-quality RNA (RIN>7.0) was used for library construction. Libraries were prepared with

146

1 µg of total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Inc.,

147

CA). Bacterial rRNA-depleted samples were generated using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion

148

Kit (NEB, MA,) and a cDNA library was constructed. The cDNA library was quantified using

149

KAPA Library Quantification kits (KAPA BIOSYSTEMS, MA) and qualified using

150

TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, CA). Indexed libraries were subjected

151

to paired-end (2×100 bp) sequencing using an Illumina NovaSeq system (Illumina Inc.) by

152

Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea).

153

2.2.2 mRNA-Seq data analysis

154

Raw reads were processed to remove low-quality and adapter sequences using Trimmomatic

155

0.38. The reads were aligned to P. aeruginosa PAO1 using Bowtie 1.1.2 15. The reference

156

genome sequence of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (GCF_000006765.1) and annotation data were

157

downloaded

from

NCBI

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000006765.1/).

158

Aligned reads were assembled and the relative abundance of genes was estimated using HTSeq

159

v0.10.0 16. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

160

using the estimated abundance of each gene in the samples. Genes with one more than zeroed

161

Read Count values in the samples were excluded. The filtered data were log2-transformed and

162

subjected to TMM normalization. Statistical significance of the differential expression data was

163

determined using exactTest (EdgeR) and fold change (p-value<0.05, |log2FC| ≥ 1). Functional

164

annotation of DEGs was performed using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) against

165

public databases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene

166

Ontology (GO). PCA was used to visualize the similarities among the samples.

167

2.3. Proteomic Analysis of P. aeruginosa during Polyethylene Degradation

168

2.3.1. Sample preparation for proteomics

169

To examine alterations in the proteome during polyethylene biodegradation, P. aeruginosa

170

was cultured in minimal media with LDPE as the carbon source for 7 days, followed by LC-

171

MS analysis. As a control group, P. aeruginosa cultured for the same duration of 7 days in

172

LCFBM supplemented with 2% glucose was used to mitigate potential interference from

173

extraneous proteins in the proteome data caused by LB medium.

174

Bacterial samples were suspended in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5)

175

containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and sonicated.

176

The protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo

177

Fisher Scientific). The filter-aided sample preparation method on a Microcon 30 K centrifugal

178

filter device (Millipore, MA,) was used for protein digestion. Reduction with Tris(2-

179

carboxyethyl)phosphine and alkylation with iodoacetic acid were followed by trypsin digestion.

180

The resulting peptides were desalted and eluted on C18 spin columns.

182

The samples were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano LC system (Thermo Fisher

183

Scientific) coupled with a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The

184

peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 Trap Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

185

and subsequent peptide separation was performed using an Acclaim PepMap RSLC analytical

186

column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectra were acquired in the data-dependent mode

187

with an automatic switch between full scan (m/z 400–2,000) and 10 data-dependent MS/MS

188

scans.

189

MS/MS raw files of each analysis were searched using Proteome Discoverer™ software (ver.

190

2.5) against P. aeruginosa database downloaded from UniProt. MS/MS data were analyzed

191

using peptide-spectrum match validation step and SEQUEST HT process. After the searching

192

process, data with FDR below 0.01 and at least six peptides in length were selected. Functional

193

annotation

194

(https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) against public databases such as the KEGG and GO. PCA

195

was used to visualize the similarities among the samples.

using

DAVID

198

PCR was conducted using primers targeting phhA, which encodes phenylalanine

199

monooxygenase (also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase [PAH]), and aceA, which encodes

200

isocitrate lyase (ICL), in the genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa (Table S1). The gDNA served as

201

the template for the first-round amplification, which included approximately ±100bp regions

202

of the genes using phhA_F1, R1 and aceA_F1, R1 primers. Subsequently, the PCR product

203

from the first round was used as a template for the second round of PCR, employing phhA_F2,

204

R2 and aceA_F2, R2 primers to amplify the gene sequences. The PCR conditions included

205

initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 47 °C for

206

30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified phhA

207

and aceA were purified and ligated into a pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega, WI). The vector

208

containing each gene was digested with NotI and EcoRI, respectively, and ligated into the

209

PET28b(+) vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The resulting plasmids were then transformed into E. coli

210

DH5a cells and sequenced. The pET28b(+) vector containing each gene was extracted and

211

transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein purification.

212

2.4.2. Expression and purification of phenylalanine monooxygenase and isocitrate lyase

213

Recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were cultured on LB medium containing kanamycin

214

at 37 °C until reaching an OD600 of 0.6–0.8. Upon reaching the desired optical density, IPTG

215

was added at a final concentration of 1 mM and the culture was further incubated for 6 h. The

216

IPTG-induced bacterial culture was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min) and the cell pellet was

217

resuspended in 40 mL binding buffer. Sonication was performed for 25 min using an ultrasonic

218

homogenizer and the cell lysates were centrifuged (9000 rpm, 30 min). Purification of

219

phenylalanine monooxygenase was conducted according to the Ni Sepharose FF Agarose

220

(Cat.LT22871, LifeTein, NJ) protocol (Table S2). The flow rate was controlled at 1 mL/min

221

and the column was filled with 5 mL His Ni Superflow resin (Code.Z5660N, TaKaRa, Tokyo,

222

Japan). A filter was inserted on top of the resin, and 15 mL of ddH2O was added to wash the

223

column. Subsequently, 15 mL binding buffer, cell lysate, another 15 mL mL binding buffer,

224

followed by 40 mM washing buffer, and 60 mM washing buffer were added sequentially.

225

Finally, 10 mL of elution buffer was added, and 1 mL fractions were collected for SDS-PAGE

226

analysis. ICL was purified using fast protein liquid chromatography. HisTrap HP columns (1

227

mL, GE Healthcare, IL) were used for purification, employing binding buffer (20 mM sodium

228

phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) for elution, followed by elution buffer (20

229

mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M imidazole, pH 7.4).

230

Proteins were analyzed following the protocol provided by the OneGel PAGE kit Plus

231

(Biosolution, Seoul, Korea). A mixture of 40 μL of protein solution and 10 μL of 5× reductase

232

buffer (containing SDS and DTT) was heated to 100 °C for denaturation. Next, 50 μL of the

233

protein sample and 10 μL of Precision Plus Protein Dual Color standards marker (10–250 kDa,

234

Bio-Rad, CA) were loaded onto the gel, which consisted of 12% acrylamide stacking and

235

separating gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-

236

250. Subsequently, the gels were fixed in a solution of 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic

237

acid, stained, destained using a solution of 40% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid, and

238

stored in 5% glacial acetic acid solution. Contaminants, including imidazole, were removed via

239

dialysis against 1× PBS (pH 7) by changing the buffer three times using high-retention

240

seamless cellulose tubing (Sigma-Aldrich). The concentrations of purified PAH and ICL were

241

determined using the Bradford assay.

242

2.5. Functional Analysis of Phenylalanine Monooxygenase and Isocitrate Lyase in

243

Polyethylene Degradation

244

To analyze the biodegradation of the enzymes on the LDPE film, based on the experimental

245

results from the thermal shift assay obtained under optimal expression conditions, the LDPE

246

film (ET31-FM-000151, Goodfellow, UK, Mw~240,000 Da) were treated with enzymes at a

247

concentration of 0.5 g/L, using 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6) at 30 °C for 30 days.

248

2.5.1. Chemical analysis of LDPE degradation by enzymes

249

The LDPE film was treated with phenylalanine monooxygenase, ICL, and a mixture of the

250

two enzymes in a glass vial containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer for 30 days. The LDPE

251

film was subjected to a 4-hour treatment with 2% SDS and washed with DI water to remove

252

the residual enzyme attached to the film.

253

The LDPE film was subjected to FTIR analysis to assess the chemical modifications

induced by phenylalanine monooxygenase. The potassium bromide pellet method was

255

employed as follows: The LDPE film was dissolved in a solvent mixture containing 1,2,4-

256

Trichlorobenzene and 0.015% butylated hydroxytoluene, and the solution was maintained in a

257

glass vial at 160 °C for 10 min to achieve a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Subsequently, the

258

solvent was evaporated under nitrogen gas for 6 h. The LDPE film pellets were compressed at

259

room temperature under a pressure of 6 MPa for 1 min using a 13 mm diameter pellet die and

260

digital hydraulic presser (CrushIR, Pike Technologies, WI, USA). Pellets were created by

261

blending 1–2 mg of each sample with 100 mg of potassium bromide. The analyses were

262

performed using an FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the transmission mode.

263

Scans were conducted over the range of 4000 to 500 cm–1.

264

The changes in the elemental composition of the plastic surface were examined by measuring

265

the binding energy using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific). The samples

266

were secured with carbon tape and subjected to measurements in the energy range 276–300 eV

267

for the C1s scan.

268

Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed to assess the thermal stability of

269

degraded LDPE. Approximately 10 mg of the sample was heated from 50 to 600 °C at a rate

270

of 10 °C/min. The analysis was conducted under nitrogen at a flow rate of 60 mL/min using a

271

TGA analyzer (TA Instruments, DE).

272

2.5.2. Analysis of LDPE depolymerization by enzymes

273

Mw and Mn were determined using high-temperature gel permeation chromatography. The

274

LDPE film was dissolved in a mixed solvent of TCB and 0.04% BHT to 1.5 mg/mL and the

275

mixture was filtered through a 0.26 μm stainless steel mesh. The mixtures (300 μL) were

276

injected into a GPC operating at an eluent flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a temperature of 160 °C

277

3. Results and Discussion

279

3.1. Polyethylene Degrading Bacteria, P. aeruginosa

280

P. aeruginosa is widely recognized for its remarkable ability to degrade plastic 17. P.

281

aeruginosa proliferated using LDPE as the sole carbon source in minimal medium. The initially

282

inoculated P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 4.93×105 CFU/mL underwent a 100-fold

283

increase, reaching 5.27×107 CFU/mL by Day 4. On Day 7, the cell count reached saturation

284

(Table 1). Subsequently, transcriptome and proteome analyses were conducted after cultivating

285

P. aeruginosa for one week. As P. aeruginosa proliferated, the culture medium became turbid,

286

and 2.14% of LDPE was degraded over the course of 7 days (Figure 1a, 1b). SEM imaging was

287

conducted to inspect the LDPE film surface, revealing a smooth surface in the control sample,

288

whereas the P. aeruginosa-cultivated sample exhibited surface corrosion (Figure 1b).

The degradation of LDPE by P. aeruginosa was chemically validated through FT-IR

299

measurements. Culturing P. aeruginosa resulted in the detection of peaks corresponding to -

300

OH (3200–3600 cm-1), C=O (1700 cm-1), and C-O (1050 cm-1) in the FT-IR spectra (Figure 1d)

oxygen content after P. aeruginosa cultivation (Figure 1e). Contact angle analysis revealed a

303

decrease in the contact angle (81.45°) compared with that of the control (88.14°), signifying an

304

increase in hydrophilicity. During plastic biodegradation, plastic is oxidized, enhancing

305

microbial biofilm formation and enzyme reactions through increased plastic hydrophilicity

306

(Figure 1f) 4, 19. Collectively, these analyses confirmed the utilization and proliferation of P.

307

aeruginosa using LDPE as the carbon source.

308

3.2. Transcriptomic Analysis of P. aeruginosa

. This finding was further corroborated by XPS analysis, which indicated an increase in

309

Transcriptome analysis of P. aeruginosa cultured with LDPE as the sole carbon source

310

revealed the upregulation of 1170 genes and downregulation of 1023 genes (Table S3).

311

Principal component analysis distinctly clustered samples from the control and PE groups,

312

indicating transcriptional changes associated with polyethylene metabolism (Figure 2a). To

elucidate the functions of these genes, upregulated and downregulated genes were categorized

314

by related pathway using the KEGG database and sorted based on the number of hits (Figure

315

327

Subsequently, genes were categorized based on their associated biological processes using

328

the GO database (Figure 2d and S1). Transmembrane transport may be involved in the transport

329

of polyethylene metabolic intermediates. The lipid metabolic process was found to participate

330

in the intracellular metabolism of depolymerized polyethylene intermediates 22. Owing to the

331

structural similarity between polyethylene and lipids, polyethylene enters the TCA cycle

332

through lipid metabolic pathways within cells 13. Additionally, an amino acid catabolic process

333

was identified, and it is noteworthy that the relevant amino acids, L-phenylalanine and valine,

334

contained hydrophobic residues. These results suggested the potential degradation of

335

hydrophobic polyethylene intermediates through hydrophobic amino acid metabolism.

336

Analysis of genes based on their cellular component, which represents their expression location,

337

revealed upregulation in the membrane and downregulation in the cytoplasm. This result

338

suggests that enhanced expression of transport proteins is required for the transportation of

339

polyethylene intermediates.

340

Genes were categorized based on molecular function, revealing an increase in

341

transmembrane transporter activity, in line with KEGG and biological process analyses.

342

Moreover, oxidoreductase activity increased, specifically involving genes acting on the CH-

343

CH group. Polyethylene is a polymer composed solely of carbon and hydrogen and is directly

344

influenced by oxidoreductases acting on the C-H groups, playing a crucial role in plastic

345

degradation 23. Oxidoreductases are the enzymes involved in oxidation/reduction processes,

346

such as oxygenases, oxidases, and dehydrogenases. Among these, the most crucial enzyme in

347

the initial stages of plastic degradation is oxygenase, which incorporates oxygen into plastics

348

24

349

electron donors. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding signifies the activation of

350

oxygenases that receive electrons from flavoproteins and FADH2 during plastic oxidation

351

(Tables S4 and S5) 25. Additionally, oxygenases commonly feature iron-sulfur clusters in their

. The upregulated genes include monooxygenases and dioxygenases, both of which require

352

active sites or rely on iron-sulfur proteins as electron donors 26. The upregulation of iron-sulfur

353

clusters and ferrous iron binding signifies the activation of these oxygenases.

354
355

3.3. Proteomic Analysis of P. aeruginosa

356

Proteomic analysis of P. aeruginosa cultivated with LDPE as the sole carbon source revealed

357

upregulation and downregulation of 888 and 870 proteins, respectively (Table S6). Principal

358

component analysis demonstrated distinct clustering of samples from the control and PE groups

359

(Figure 3a). The overall protein analysis results closely resembled those of the transcriptome

360

analysis. KEGG database analysis highlighted the involvement of fatty acid degradation and

361

lipoic acid metabolism in the metabolism of polyethylene intermediate molecules (Figure 3b,

362

3c) 13, 27. Additionally, an increase in the degradation of hydrophobic amino acids (valine,

363

leucine, isoleucine, alanine, and tryptophan) was observed. These results suggested the

364

potential degradation of hydrophobic polyethylene intermediates through hydrophobic amino

365

acid metabolism.

By utilizing the GO database to categorize proteins according to biological processes, lipid

metabolic and hydrophobic amino acid catabolic processes (Leucine and L-phenylalanine)

376

were increased, corroborating the findings from the KEGG analysis (Figure 3d, S2).

377

Additionally, nitrate assimilation was upregulated. As polyethylene comprises only carbon and

378

hydrogen and lacks nitrogen, microorganisms can convert polyethylene metabolic

379

intermediates into amino acids via nitrogen fixation 28. Increased hydrophobic amino acid

380

transport (L-alanine, D-alanine, and L-valine) further supports this possibility. Analysis of

381

proteins based on cellular components revealed upregulation of proteins in the periplasmic

382

space, with downregulation in the cytosol and cytoplasm. Long-chain fatty acid-transporting

383

porin activity increased, suggesting its involvement in the intracellular transport of

384

polyethylene degradation intermediates 29. Furthermore, the upregulation of oxidoreductase

385

activity acting on the CH-CH group of donors indicates the expression of enzymes directly

386

engaged in polyethylene degradation. Flavin adenine dinucleotide binding suggested the

387

potential involvement of enzymes receiving electrons from FADH2 during polyethylene

388

degradation 30.

391

Hydrophobic amino acid and lipid metabolism emerged as commonly identified metabolic

392

pathways in both the transcriptome and proteome analyses (Table 2). Although lipid

393

metabolism is considered a key pathway for plastic degradation, our analysis suggested the

394

potential degradation of hydrophobic intermediates via the hydrophobic amino acid

395

degradation pathway 14. Examination of gene and protein functions revealed consistent

396

upregulation of transporter proteins and oxidoreductase activities in the CH-CH group.

397

Transporter proteins, such as long-chain fatty acid-transporting porins, facilitate the transport

398

of hydrophobic intermediate molecules into cells, whereas oxidoreductases play a crucial role

399

in plastic degradation 13, 22, 31.

Among the 247 genes that were upregulated simultaneously in both the transcriptome and

404

proteome, the majority were associated with transporter functions, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase

405

(involved in lipid metabolism), and largely uncharacterized hypothetical proteins (Table S9).

406

Genes related to oxygenases that are capable of initiating the initial oxidation of polyolefin

407

plastics are composed of only carbon and hydrogen, including cytochrome P450, alkane

408

monooxygenase, and phenylalanine monooxygenase 10, 11, 22. Notably, the mRNA expression

409

level of phenylalanine monooxygenase increased by 3.16-fold in microbial samples degrading

410

PE, and the enzyme expression, analyzed through proteomic analysis, increased by 5.84-fold.

411

However, the role of phenylalanine monooxygenase in plastic degradation remains unclear.

412

Phenylalanine monooxygenase acts on the phenyl residue of L-phenylalanine, a hydrophobic

413

amino acid, forming a hydroxyl group and oxidizing L-phenylalanine into L-tyrosine 32. Unlike

414

cytochrome P450 and alkane monooxygenase, which are membrane proteins, phenylalanine

415

monooxygenase is a cytoplasmic enzyme 33. This characteristic renders phenylalanine

416

monooxygenase suitable for plastic degradation applications. Phenylalanine monooxygenase

417

is expressed in soluble form, which enables its mass expression and purification. Therefore,

418

this enzyme is well-suited for investigating functions and improving performance. Additionally,

419

the ease of large-scale production of phenylalanine monooxygenase makes it highly suitable

420

for plastic degradation.

421

After oxidition by oxidizing enzymes, polyethylene must be depolymerized into low

422

molecular weight hydrocarbons to be fully degraded by microorganisms. Unlike polyester

423

plastics, which are depolymerized through ester bonds, polyethylene is composed of C-C bonds.

424

Previous studies have suggested that esterases, such as lipases, which are involved in the

425

degradation of polyester plastics, may also play a role in the depolymerization of polyethylene

426

9

427

we observed a 5.18-fold increase in the expression of ICL, an enzyme that cleaves the C-C

428

bonds in isocitrate to produce glyoxylate and succinate 34. ICL shows great potential for

429

involvement in polyethylene depolymerization because of its ability to cleave C-C bonds,

430

which distinguishes it from previously proposed esterase candidates.

435

using affinity chromatography and confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S3). A protein of

436

approximately 30 kDa was observed, which is consistent with the known size of phenylalanine

437

monooxygenase, indicating successful protein expression. The protein derived from aceA was

438

approximately 59 kDa, matching the expected size of ICL. Moreover, no other proteins were

439

visible in the bands corresponding to each protein, confirming the successful purification.

440

3.5.2. Degradation step1: polyethylene oxidation by phenylalanine monooxygenase

441

Polyethylene, a polymer composed of carbon and hydrogen, undergoes oxidation as the

442

initial step in its biodegradation process. Phenylalanine monooxygenase can introduce a

443

hydroxyl (-OH) group into C-H bonds. FT-IR analysis was conducted to examine the chemical

444

functional groups on the surface of LDPE. When treated with PAH, C-O groups at 1050 cm-1

445

and hydroxyl groups (-OH) at 3000–3600 cm-1 were identified (Figure 4a) 35. Subsequently,

446

the surface carbon binding energies of LDPE treated with phenylalanine monooxygenase were

447

examined using XPS (Table S10). In the control group, only C-C bonds were detected at 284.5

448

eV, whereas in the PAH-treated group, C-O bonds were identified at 285.6 eV, constituting 10.6%

449

of the total bonds (Figure 4d, 4f) 4, 36, 37. This finding was supported by the oxygen elemental

450

analysis, with minimal oxygen detected in the control group (Figure 4e). Although

451

polyethylene is composed solely of carbon and hydrogen, XPS, which is highly sensitive, can

452

detect trace amounts of oxygen in a the surrounding environment of the device. In the enzyme-

453

treated group, significant increase in C-O bonds at 532.2, C=O bonds at 531.1, and COO- at

454

533.4 eV were observed, indicating the oxidation ability of phenylalanine monooxygenase on

455

polyethylene (Figure 4g) 38. The C-O bond observed in the C1s and O1s scans was attributed

456

to the formation of C-OH by PAH. This result was in line with the XPS findings, confirming

457

the introduction of hydroxyl groups by phenylalanine monooxygenase and the presence of C-

458

O bonds in LDPE. The thermal stability of LDPE was assessed using TGA, revealing thermal

459

decomposition at 479.3 °C in the control group (Figure 5a). Plastics exhibit distinct thermal

460

decomposition temperatures, and alterations in these temperatures signify plastic degradation.

461

In the PAH-treated group, the decomposition temperature decreased, with maximum

462

decomposition rates observed at 424.28 and 461.93 °C, indicating LDPE oxidation and

463

formation of intermediate molecules 39.

When ICL was applied to the LDPE film, FT-IR analysis showed results identical to those

of the control group, indicating that no oxidation occurred (Figure 4b). Additionally, XPS

482

analysis revealed no significant differences between the control and isocitrate lyase-treated
24

483

groups, confirming that ICL lacks the ability to oxidize plastic (Figure 4h, 4i). TGA analysis

484

indicated a slight increase of approximately 7 °C in the decomposition temperature but with

485

minimal impact compared with the PAH-treated group (Figure 5b). When both PAH and ICL

486

were applied simultaneously, FT-IR, XPS, and TGA results were nearly identical to those

487

obtained by treating LDPE with PAH alone, suggesting that PAH was responsible for the

488

oxidation of polyethylene (Figure 4c, 4j, 4k, 5c). The molecular weight of enzyme-treated

489

LDPE was analyzed to assess the role of ICL as a depolymerase (Table 3) 18. There was no

490

significant difference in the Mn among the control, PAH, ICL, and PAH+ICL experimental

491

groups (Figure 5e). While the Mw did not decrease when PAH and ICL were applied

492

individually, a decrease of approximately 3.5% from 238,251 to 229,864 Da was observed

493

when both enzymes were applied simultaneously (Figure 5f). Similarly, while the Z-average

494

molecular weight (Mz) did not decrease when PAH and ICL were applied individually, a

495

decrease of approximately 7.0% from 803,487 to 747,396 Da was observed when both enzymes

496

were applied simultaneously (Figure 5g). The statistical significance between the control and

497

PAH+ICL groups was assessed using Student's t-test, resulting in a p-value of 0.065. Biological

498

plastic degradation reactions often proceed via limited-extent depolymerization reactions. In

499

cases of broad depolymerization, where enzymes react uniformly with all molecular weights

500

of the material, changes are observed in the Mn, Mw, and Mz values. However, to a limited

501

extent, depolymerization and effective enzyme reactions with low molecular weight substances

502

lead to significant variations in Mn, whereas effective reactions with high molecular weight

503

substances result in significant variations in Mz 40. Depolymerization mediated by PAH and

504

ICL resulted in changes in Mz, indicating effective enzyme reactions with high molecular

505

weight substances in limited extent depolymerization. A limited extent of depolymerization

506

was also observed in the GPC curve. LDPE treated with PAH showed no significant difference

507

from the control, indicating that PAH did not contribute to depolymerization. However, when

25
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-n8145 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9527-9689 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

508

treated with ICL, the curve shifted toward the higher molecular weight region, suggesting that

509

a limited extent of depolymerization primarily occurred in the lower molecular weight range.

510

However, no statistically significant difference was observed in molecular weight due to low

511

efficiency. In samples simultaneously treated with both PAH and ICL, a reduction in the

512

number of molecules was observed in the high molecular weight region. (Figure S4). Further

513

research on precise enzymatic reaction mechanisms is necessary to understand the underlying

514

causes of such phenomena.

This result suggests that although ICL cannot effectively depolymerize polyethylene itself,

521

it exhibits depolymerization activity in PAH-oxidized polyethylene 36, 41. Since isocitrate is

more oxidized molecule compared to polyethylene, primary oxidation may be necessary for

523

ICL activity. Furthermore, while most previous studies focused on identifying a single enzyme

524

capable of degrading plastic, the results of this study indicate at least a two-step process of

525

oxidation and depolymerization during polyethylene degradation, highlighting the need for

526

sequential reactions involving multiple enzymes 10. Moreover, the results demonstrated that

527

ICL, which is capable of breaking the C-C bonds of oxidized polyethylene, can catalyze the

528

depolymerization of polyethylene.

4. Conclusion

531

We conducted transcriptome and proteome analyses of the plastic-degrading microbe P.

532

aeruginosa to identify genes and enzymes with increased expression levels. Using the KEGG

533

and GO databases, we analyzed the associated metabolic pathways and confirmed the potential

534

involvement of lipid and hydrophobic amino acid metabolism in polyethylene degradation.

535

Subsequently, genes showing elevated expression levels in both transcriptome and proteome

536

analyses were selected and oxygenases involved in the initial oxidation of plastics were

537

identified. Remarkably, phenylalanine monooxygenase, which was previously unrecognized in

538

plastic degradation, was identified along with alkane monooxygenase and cytochrome P450

539

monooxygenase, both of which are known for their involvement in the initial oxidation of

540

plastics. Furthermore, among the upregulated enzymes, ICL, capable of breaking the C-C bond

541

in polyethylene, was identified as a potential depolymerase.

542

The oxidative capability of enzyme was confirmed by the formation of C-O, C=O, and -OH

543

functional groups on the LDPE film after treatment with phenylalanine monooxygenase. ICL

544

did not affect LDPE oxidation when used alone; however, it exhibited depolymerization

545

activity in oxidized LDPE when co-treated with phenylalanine monooxygenase. This study

546

delineated the degradation of polyethylene into two stages, oxidation and depolymerization,

547

and demonstrated degradation by purifying the enzymes involved at each stage. In particular,

548

lyases capable of breaking the C-C bond in polyethylene were identified and proposed as

549

depolymerization enzymes.

550

This study had limitations in qualitatively demonstrating the oxidative and depolymerization

551

abilities of plastic. Hence, further research, such as enzyme kinetic studies, is required to

552

develop quantitative measurement methods for degradation rates. Additionally, subsequent

553

studies are necessary to analyze the structures of phenylalanine monooxygenase and isocitrate

554

lyase discovered in this study and to engineer them for enhanced degradation performance,

555

such as directed evolution. Furthermore, exploring the potential industrial applications of

556

enzymes through mass production and purification can significantly contribute to addressing

557

plastic pollution.
