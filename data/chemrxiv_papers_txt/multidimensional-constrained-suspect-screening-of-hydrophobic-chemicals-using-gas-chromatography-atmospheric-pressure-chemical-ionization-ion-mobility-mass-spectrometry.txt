ABSTRACT：

16

Suspect screening strives to rapidly monitor a large number of substances in a sample

17

using mass spectral libraries. For hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs), these

18

libraries are primarily based on electron ionization mass spectra. To improve the

19

efficacy of suspect screening, new libraries and workflows are required, leveraging the

20

highly specific analytical data acquired by state-of-the-art mass spectrometers. In this

21

study, we established a new library for 1,590 suspect contaminants, including exact

22

mass and a combination of measured and model-predicted values for retention time (RT)

23

and collision cross section (CCS). The accuracy of in silico predictions was assessed

24

using standards for 102 environmental contaminants. Thereafter, using gas

25

chromatography-atmospheric

26

spectrometry, a suspect screening workflow constrained by full scan mass spectrum (i.e.,

27

MS1), RT, CCS, and fragmentation spectrum (i.e., MS2), together with a continuous

28

scoring system, was established to reduce false positives and improve identification

29

confidence. Application of the method to fortified and standard reference sediment

30

samples demonstrated true positive rates of 79% and 64%, respectively, with all false

31

positives attributed to suspect isomers, indicating that the method is highly specific.

32

This study offers a new workflow for improved suspect screening of HOCs using

33

multidimensional information, and highlights the need to enrich CCS databases and

34

extend the applicable chemical space of current in silico tools to non-polar substances.

INTRODUCTION

43

The number of chemicals used in society is large and constantly increasing. For

44

instance, a survey of 22 chemical inventories from 19 countries revealed over 350,000

45

registered substances,1 while between 700 and 1,700 new chemicals are added each

46

year to the United States’ TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) and European REACH

47

(Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) inventories

48

alone.2 This situation challenges our capacity for chemical monitoring and risk

49

assessment using conventional approaches. To address this issue, suspect screening has

50

emerged as a tool for rapidly detecting a large number of substances by matching data

51

acquired by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to that contained in a database.

52

High-confidence matches guide the acquisition of standards for the final confirmation

53

or exclusion of the identification.3

54

Typically, suspect screening of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) involves

55

matching retention indices (RI) and mass spectral fingerprints derived from gas

56

chromatography (GC) with electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV.4 However, this strategy is

57

limited by the availability of EI mass spectra (particularly high-resolution) in

58

libraries.3,5 Further, the extensive fragmentation and frequent absence of molecular ions

59

using EI hinder structure predictions. Therefore, novel suspect lists and workflows with

60

high specificity using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry are required.

61

As a soft ionization technique for GC, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization

62

(APCI) can harness molecular ions for HOCs through charge/proton transfer.6 When

63

coupled to ion mobility (IM)-HRMS, ions are further separated based on their

interactions with neutral buffering gases under an electric field. Differences in drift time

65

produced from IM enhance the resolving-power of product ion scans by removing co-

66

eluting ions. Collision cross section (CCS) values derived from drift times are a novel

68

multidimensional information can be acquired or predicted for each compound, namely

However, suspect screening of HOCs using multidimensional information has not been

Consequently,

74

This study aims to establish and validate a multidimensional-constrained workflow

75

for suspect screening of HOCs using GC-APCI-IM-HRMS. Suspect lists were

76

compiled consisting of exact mass and a combination of measured and model-predicted

77

RT and CCS values. A continuous scoring system was established to narrow down the

78

number of candidates using continuous similarity information. Finally, our method was

79

validated using sediment samples, considering their complex matrix and function as a

80

sink for HOCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

83

Instrumental analysis. The present work employed a Waters quadrupole-cyclic ion

84

mobility-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Wilmslow, U.K.) coupled to

85

an Agilent 8890 GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A) via APCI in

positive mode under both dry and wet conditions using previously optimized

87

parameters.8 The detector was operated in high-definition MSE mode with the collision

88

energy fixed at 6 eV in low energy mode and ramped between 15-50 eV in high energy

89

mode. The detailed instrumental method is described in Section A of the Supporting

90

Information (SI). Progenesis QI (version 3.0, Waters Corp.) was used for lockmass

91

correction, precursor and product ion pairing, peak picking, and alignment. MS1 and

92

MS2 data were exported separately and MS2 data was converted to SIRIUS format using

93

a custom R script (available at https://github.com/Xiaodi-Shi/4D-suspect). Further

94

information on software parameters is provided in Sections B of the SI.

95
96

Suspect lists. We compiled two suspect lists containing information on identity (i.e.,

97

CAS, InChIKey, and formula), exact mass, RT, and CCS. The first list was derived from

98

matching contaminants from all GC-based suspect lists in the NORMAN-SLE9 with

99

experimentally-derived CCS values from a unified database of 23 scientific articles

100

published between 2016 and 2022,7 resulting in 1,060 compounds. A total of 511 of

101

these substances were missing RI data, requiring prediction (see below). The second

102

list was derived from both the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme’s list of

103

chemicals of emerging Arctic concern, as well as the European Chemical Agency’s list

104

of substances of very high concern.10,11 Substances with ionizable functional groups and

105

substances which already occurred on the first list were removed, leaving a total of 530

106

chemicals of concern. For this list, only 74 contaminants had literature CCS values in

107

the aforementioned unified database,7 while 63 had literature RI data.

108

Since analytes can be ionized through charge/proton transfer using APCI,6 exact

109

masses of the most abundant isotope for both M+. and [M+H]+ ions were calculated. We

110

assumed that possible discrepancies in CCS values among M+., [M+H]+, and [M-H]-

111

ions fell within measurement uncertainty. For compounds lacking literature CCS values,

112

predictions were made for [M+H]+ ions using the AllCCS2 algorithm.12 Since alkanes

113

evade ionization using APCI, the Fiehn RI was adopted with fatty acid methyl esters as

114

references.13 For both lists, experimental Fiehn RIs were collected from the MS-DIAL

115

metabolomics MSP spectral kit, if available.14 Kovats RIs for the remaining compounds

116

were sourced from the NIST RI library, or otherwise predicted using a deep

117

convolutional neural network method.15 Kovats RIs were then converted to Fiehn RIs,

118

and thereafter RT. Conversions among RT and RIs are described in Section C and Table

119

S1-3 in the SI. The two suspect lists can be found in Tables S4 and S5 in the SI.

120

The quality of suspect list data was estimated by comparing measured and

121

literature/model-predicted values. MS1, RT, CCS, and MS2 were acquired for 102

122

environmental contaminant standards (1.44< log Kow <16.8; -9.31< log Kaw <11.3),

123

including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphate esters (OPEs),

124

polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and other

125

organohalogens. We further predicted RTs for all 102 of these contaminants and CCS

126

values for a subset of 85 capable of generating M+., [M+H]+, or [M-H]+ ions as base

127

peaks using aforementioned models. These contaminants, together with their measured

128

and predicted qualitative information, are listed in Table S6 in the SI.

Multidimensional suspect screening. Inspired by a previously developed approach for

131

metabolomics,16 a workflow with a continuous scoring system was established. This

132

approach differs from confidence level systems (e.g., the Schymanski confidence scale)

133

by providing continuous uncertainty/similarity information to reduce false positive

134

results and improve identification confidence.17,18

135

Peaks were matched against suspect lists by exact mass, RT, and CCS using a

136

custom R script (available at https://github.com/Xiaodi-Shi/4D-suspect). The error

137

threshold for exact mass measurements was set to <5 ppm for substances with mass-to-

138

charge >200 Da and <2 mDa for substances <200 Da. For RT and CCS, differences

139

between measured and reference values were calculated using Equations (E) 1 and 2. A

140

difference smaller than the high-confidence threshold (CThigh) scored 100%, while

141

peaks with differences larger than the low-confidence threshold were excluded (CTlow).

142

If a difference fell between CThigh and CTlow, a score was calculated using E3.

The thresholds were determined based on the quality of suspect lists (see discussion in

147

the next section). Only candidates with matches in all three dimensions were retained.

148

MS1 and MS2 spectra were further checked. Observation of at least one isotope ion

149

was required, and the geometric mean of isotopic relative intensity deviation should be

150

lower than 5%.19 MS2 similarity scores were acquired from SIRIUS+CSI:FingerID

151

(version 5.8.6).20 Since candidates were known after matches of exact mass, RT, and

152

CCS, we specified the formula, adduct, parent ion, and InChIKey in SIRIUS. Detailed

153

SIRIUS parameters are described in Section B of the SI. The performance of MS2

154

similarity using SIRIUS was evaluated using 63 of 102 measured contaminants with

155

M+./[M+H]+ ions as the base peak and at least two detected monoisotopic fragment ions

156

in MS2. Fragment ions of these 63 contaminants are provided in the SI in NIST MSP

157

library format. The final multidimensional score was calculated using E4.

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (%) = 𝑊𝑅𝑇 × 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑅𝑇 + 𝑊𝐶𝐶𝑆 × 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐶𝐶𝑆 + 𝑊𝑀𝑆2 × 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑀𝑆2

159

The true positive rate was independent of the assignment of weights in this study, based

160

on testing with real sediment samples (see Figure S1 in the SI). Considering the

161

dependence of RT on chromatographic conditions, less weight was assigned to the RT

162

score (WRT=0.2) than CCS and MS2 scores (0.4 for both). The same weightings were

163

previously employed in a liquid chromatography (LC)-based metabolomic workflow.16

164

When the MS2 score could not be estimated (e.g., < two detected monoisotopic fragment

165

ions in MS2), accurate measurement of RT and CCS becomes essential. Thus, the cutoff

166

score was set at 60% for potential candidates. The highest-scored candidate for each

167

suspect compound was retained.

174

(0-2 cm) sediment collected from a reference site (58.26º N,16.91º E) in the Baltic Sea

175

in January 2023.21 The NIST material was used as-received while the fortified sediment

176

was prepared by sieving (mesh size 1 mm), followed by addition of about 1 ng of each

177

contaminant. Samples were extracted three times by accelerated solvent extraction

178

(ASE 350; Dionex, U.S.A.) using 20 mL of acetone/n-hexane (1:1 v/v) per cycle,

179

following previously described procedures (for further details, see Section D of the SI).8

180

Instrumental analysis and data processing were carried out as described above.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

183

Performance of model predictions for suspect lists. Among 102 measured

184

contaminants, 34 already had literature CCS values in our suspect lists, offering an

185

opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of our measured values. Previous interlaboratory

186

and interplatform comparisons reported that CCS relative deviations tend to be within

187

±2%.7,22-24 In the present work, relative deviations between measured and

188

experimentally-derived CCS values fell within ±2% for 67.6% of substances, and

189

within ±3% for 82.3% (Figure 1A). Based on these results, high- and low-confidence

190

thresholds for literature CCS values were set at ±2% and ±3%, respectively. For the

191

remaining 68 substances, experimentally determined CCS values are reported here for

192

the first time.

calculated for differences between high- and low-confidence thresholds (denoted by

The comparison between our measured and predicted CCS values for 85

204

contaminants capable of generating M+., [M+H]+, or [M-H]+ ions as base peaks showed

205

an average relative deviation (±standard deviation [SD]) of -7.03% (±5.42%),

206

indicating an overprediction of CCS values by the ALLCCS2 model. This considerable

207

discrepancy is attributed to the fact that most compounds used in the model’s training

208

set are non-halogenated endogenous metabolites which tend to have larger CCS values

209

than halogenated substances.12,25 All relative deviations in measured CCS values among

210

available isomers fell within 5%. To avoid misidentification at the isomeric level, high-

211

and low-confidence thresholds for predicted CCS values were set at ±5% and ±7%

212

covering 34.1% and 48.2% of 85 measured contaminants, respectively (Figure 1B).

213

In contrast to CCS, uncertainties associated with RT predictions (mean ± SD of

214

0.086 ± 1.13 min, n=102) are comparable to those of RTs converted from literature RI

215

values (mean ± SD of 0.15 ± 0.69 min, n=36; Figure 1C-D). This resulted from the

216

similarity between our measured contaminants and compounds for model training.15

217

For RTs from both sources, mean ± SD and mean ± 2 × SD were selected as high- and

218

low-confidence thresholds, respectively.

219

The performance of SIRIUS for HOCs was evaluated using 63 of 102 measured

220

contaminants with M+./[M+H]+ ions as the base peak and at least two detected

221

monoisotopic fragment ions in MS2. The mean ± SD of SIRIUS similarities were 72.43

222

± 18.0 %. (see Table S6 in the SI for detailed scores). Although this model is mainly

223

trained on data acquired using electrospray ionization,20 the relatively high scores

224

observed indicate that the mechanism of collision induced dissociation could be

225

independent of ionization method.

226
227

Workflow validation. The number of compound hits decreased as more dimensions

228

were added to the screening (Figure 2). There were 63 and 66 hits in the fortified

229

sediment and SRM 1941b, respectively, with all exact mass, RT, and CCS matched.

230

These numbers are 36.3% and 40% lower than those obtained with only exact mass and

231

RT matched for the fortified sediment and SRM1941b, respectively. This indicates that

232

the analytical space for potential candidates can be effectively constrained using CCS

233

as an additional dimension.

240

After checking mass spectra, 50 candidates in the fortified sediment and 51

241

candidates in SRM 1941b remained (i.e. multidimensional scores >60%; Figure 2).

242

According to the Schymanski confidence scale, these candidates would be classified as

243

level 2/3, indicating a large fraction of false positive results.17,18 Our continuous scoring

244

system can aid in further narrowing down the number of candidates. Finally, the

245

highest-scoring candidates for each suspect compound were retained (19 in the fortified

246

sediment and 14 in SRM 1941b). These hits included PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs, OPEs,

247

hexachlorobenzene, and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane. Detailed scores for

248

each compound are listed in the Table S7 in the SI. The true positive rates were 78.9%

249

and 64.3% for the fortified and standard samples, respectively (Figure 2). Notably, all

250

false positives were isomers of the correct compounds. These results suggest that the

251

combination of the exact mass of the molecular ion, isotopic distribution, and fragment

252

ions can effectively determine the elemental composition, particularly for halogenated

253

compounds, while CCS matching further constrains the general structure.

254
255

Perspectives. Based on analytical data acquired by GC-APCI-IM-HRMS, a suspect

256

screening workflow for HOCs constrained by MS1, RT, CCS, and MS2, together with a

257

continuous scoring system, was established for the first time. True positive rates of 78.9%

258

and 64.3% for the fortified sediment and SRM 1941b were achieved, respectively, with

259

misidentification only at the isomeric level. CCS of (quasi-)molecular ion is a

260

confirmatory dimension with high reproducibility to improve identification confidence.

261

However, since conventional EI for GC-based characterization hampers formation of

262

the molecular ions, prior experimental CCS values were acquired mostly for

263

compounds suitable for LC measurement with soft ionization. In our suspect lists, 1,134

264

compounds had literature CCS values, representing only 28% of organic pollutants in

265

the unified CCS database, and over 20 times fewer than the number of compounds in

266

the METLIN-CCS database.7,26 Consequently, current CCS prediction models,

267

primarily trained on non-halogenated endogenous metabolites, displayed considerable

268

error (mean ± SD: -7.23% ± 5.32%) when predicting CCS for HOCs (which are mainly

269

halogenated) in this study. Harnessing molecular ions using APCI presents

270

opportunities to enrich CCS databases for HOCs and to extend the applicable chemical

272

crucial for keeping analytical techniques aligned with the introduction of emerging
