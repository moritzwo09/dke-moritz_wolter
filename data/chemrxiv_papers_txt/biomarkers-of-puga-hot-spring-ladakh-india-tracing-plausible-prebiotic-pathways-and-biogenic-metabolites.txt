Abstract

28

The search to unravel the origins of life on Earth pivots on recognizing environments capable
of synthesizing and preserving prebiotic organic molecules (chemical precursors to biological
systems). Prebiotic chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the origin of life on Earth,
and terrestrial hydrothermal systems may offer the suitable environment for its emergence. In
this study, we investigated the travertine deposit of the Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India- a site
that not only mimics early Earth environments but also shares similarities with the
hydrothermal conditions proposed for early and modern-day Mars. The Puga hot spring is
situated in extreme cold location settings of Ladakh, India which is characterized by nearneutral to alkaline waters, enriched in boron, and exhibiting rapid calcium carbonate
precipitation. Such features are conducive to capturing and preserving organic molecules that
serve as molecular fossils of prebiotic processes.

We employed gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for the first time
to analyse sample scraped from both the inner and outer surfaces of the travertine deposit of
Puga hot spring. Key compounds identified include traces of β-alanine derivatives (amino
propanoic acid), pyran-2-thione, TMS-derivatized formamide, cyclooctasulphur (S₈), and
hexadecenoic methyl ester (fatty acid). These findings suggest that both biogenic and abiotic
mechanisms may contribute to the synthesis and preservation of these molecules. We
hypothesised reaction pathways for molecules identified, which supports possibility of the
dynamic interplay between high-temperature geothermal fluids and rapid cooling in a high
UV, low-pressure environment facilitating the formation of complex prebiotic molecules.
The detection of these compounds in the Puga travertine not only supports the hypothesis that
hot spring environments could have been frameworks of early life on Earth but also highlights
their potential as analogues for extraterrestrial settings. Current study highlights the pivotal
role of hydrothermal systems in chemical evolution associated with origin of life. Our findings
provide substantial support for the hypothesis of a natural "prebiotic soup" like conditions in
Puga hot-spring, Ladakh, India, revealing that cold environmental conditions may possibly
work in synergy with hot spring conditions, playing a crucial role in effectively preserving
organic moieties within calcic matrices.

Introduction

63

The origin of life on Earth remains one of the most captivating questions in science (Pross and

64

Pascal, 2013). It's possible that the right conditions existed in places such as deep-sea

65

hydrothermal vents, geothermal hot springs, or even in hidden underground areas where water

66

flows steadily (Schaible et al., 2024). Recent studies increasingly suggest that natural settings

67

like hot springs and other hydrothermal areas might have offered the ideal mix of energy,

68

reactive chemicals, and mineral structures necessary to kickstart prebiotic chemistry (Colín-

69

García et al., 2019; Damer and Deamer, 2020; Deamer et al., 2019; Villafañe-Barajas and

70

Colín-García, 2021). Hot springs found on land provided the right conditions for the early

71

chemical reactions that sparked life. They were originally proposed as likely places for life's

72

beginnings because these springs can accumulate organic materials and use natural cycles of

73

wet and dry periods, driven by evaporation, to solve the “water problem” associated with deep

74

hydrothermal vents (Damer and Deamer, 2020; Schaible et al., 2024).

75

Hydrothermal environments are dynamic places where hot water colliding with the Earth's

76

crust creates pronounced temperature and chemical differences. These variations initiate the

77

process for the conversion of simple inorganic compounds into more complex organic

78

molecules. It is reported that blending hydrothermal fluids with other natural waters could lead

79

to the formation of diverse organic compounds such as amino acids and nucleobases that are

80

central to the idea of prebiotic chemistry (Shock and Schulte, 1998). This buildup of chemical

81

complexity is seen as a key precursor to life on early Earth.

82

Travertine formations that develop around hot springs and in rapid calcium carbonate

83

precipitation zones within hydrothermal systems serve as natural archives of ancient

84

geochemical processes while effectively preserving them against degradation over geological

85

timescales (Garcia et al., 2021; Ricketts et al., 2019). Recent studies have focused on these

86

deposits as potential insights into the chemical pathways that preceded biological life (Luo et

87

al., 2022; Martin et al., 2008). In hot spring system like Puga the precipitation is driven by the

88

cooling and degassing of mineral-rich geothermal waters. This process can capture transient

89

organic species that may have been generated by prebiotic reactions, thereby preserving a

90

molecular record that is accessible through modern analytical techniques.

91

The Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India, is one of the notable modern analogues of early Earth

92

conditions, drawing considerable astrobiological interest. Located high in the Indian

93

Himalayas, this site presents a unique combination of characteristics that resembles the

94

environments theorized to have sparked life on our planet (Chaddha et al., 2024a, 2024b;

95

Shukla et al., 2023). The Puga hot spring features waters that range from neutral to alkaline pH

96

(pH ; 7-10) and discharge at roughly 70°C, with elevated boron levels and swift travertine

97

formation (Dutta et al., 2023). Boron, abundant in these geothermal waters, has been associated

98

with stabilizing ribose a crucial RNA building block (Ricardo et al., 2004). The combination

99

of boron and other essential ions thus creates an environment conducive to the synthesis of

100

life’s fundamental molecules. Recent findings also highlight Puga’s importance as a prebiotic

101

analogue (Sánchez-García et al., 2024).

102

In this study, we focus on detecting and characterizing the biomarkers and organic molecules

103

preserved within the travertine deposits of the Puga hot spring, which serve as molecular fossils

104

offering crucial insights into the metabolic pathways and environmental conditions that existed

105

during their formation (Summons et al., 2008). Moreover, the selection of Puga is supported by

106

its striking resemblance to extraterrestrial environments, particularly Mars, where evidence

107

suggests that hydrothermal systems once thrived during the planet’s early evolution (Boulesteix

108

et al., 2024; Brakenridge et al., 1985; Ruff et al., 2020). Consequently, finding similar organic

109

compounds in Earth’s hot springs, such as those at Puga, not only reinforces the hypothesis of

110

prebiotic chemistry on early Earth but also broadens our prospects for detecting signs of life

111

on other planets. By analysing these biomarkers, our aim is to trace the chemical evolution that

112

may have set the stage for the emergence of life. If these hydrothermal systems can promote

113

the synthesis and preservation of organic molecules under harsh conditions such as high UV

114

radiation, extreme cold environments, and low atmospheric pressure similar to those on modern

115

Mars, then sites like Puga in Ladakh, India, become crucial for guiding future astrobiological

116

explorations towards origin of life.

Ladakh, a region in the Trans-Himalayan area typically found above 3000 meters and often

135

called the "cold desert of India" was chosen as the study site (Juyal, 2014). This region endures

136

scarce rainfall, very low temperatures, and wide daily temperature fluctuations (Blöthe et al.,

137

2014; Schmidt and Nüsser, 2017), with summer highs reaching 34.8°C and winter temperatures

138

dipping to -27.9°C (Chevuturi et al., 2018). Its sparse vegetation, rugged terrain, and high

139

altitude expose it to UV-A radiation levels up to ten times those at sea level (Chaddha et al.,

140

2021, 2024b; Sharma and Phartiyal, 2018). These conditions, which include low atmospheric

141

pressure and intense UV exposure, mirror aspects of the current Martian environment, making

143

pristine extreme environments like glaciers, arid terrains, sand dunes, interdunal lakes,

144

geothermal springs, saline lakes, and manganese-rich varnish-coated rocks that further

145

emphasize its similarity to Martian conditions (Chaddha et al., 2024a, 2024b, 2024c ; Chaddha

146

et al., 2023; Chaddha et al.,2021; Pandey et al., 2020). Samples were collected from a site

147

near Ladakh’s Puga Valley, a prominent geothermal energy location in the eastern Indus Valley

148

within the North-Western Himalayas. Puga, situated south of the Indus Suture Zone in the Tso

149

Morari area, is renowned for its geothermal features, such as hot springs, mud pools, and

150

mineral deposits rich in sulphur and borax (Craig et al., 2013; Dutta et al., 2023). At this site,

151

hot spring water temperatures can reach up to 84°C at the vent, while nearby areas register

152

around 5°C (Craig et al., 2013). The underlying geology includes a variety of rock types, such

153

as crystalline limestone, marble, carbon-rich shale, green chert, and mafic to ultramafic

154

formations (Dutta et al., 2023).

155

Samples were collected and processed for a range of analytical measurements as described by

156

(Chaddha et al., 2024c; Shukla et al., 2023). In summary, a whitish sinter deposit was retrieved

157

from the mouth of the Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India (33°13′39.38″N, 78°18′22.98″E, 4414

158

m a.s.l.) using a pre-sterilized chisel. The sample was then wrapped in aluminium foil and

159

placed in clean plastic boxes for transport to the laboratory. To minimize contamination, both

160

the inner and outer layers of the travertine sample were carefully removed using a Dremel

161

Micro drill (Model 800) equipped with a diamond-coated, sterilized coarse bit. These extracted

162

fragments were subsequently stored in small Eppendorf tubes for organic biomarker analysis.

GC-MS-MS analysis of the travertine sample collected from mouth of the Puga hot spring has

216

enabled the identification of organic biosignatures within travertine samples. Inner and outer

217

surface of the travertine sample (Fig.1d) reveals chromatograms with almost similar peaks (Fig.

218

2a, b). The resulting chromatograms showed nearly identical peak profiles, demonstrating a

219

homogeneous distribution of organic compounds throughout the formation. Both inner and

220

outer surface presents chromatograms at similar retention time, with relative high abundance

221

peaks at 7.78 min (I), 7.82 min (O), 12.39 min (I), 12.41min (O). There are other minor peaks

222

available as marked in respective chromatograms (Fig.2 a, b). On, investigating the individual

223

peaks various organic compounds were obtained with a TMS (trimethyl silane) group

224

connected to the molecule seen in the spectrometer as a result of trimethyl Silylation carried

225

out on the sample before injecting it into the GC-MS/MS from inner and outer surface of the

226

travertine sample (Fig.3). Both inner and outer surface of the travertine sample contains similar

compounds, therefore it’s evident that homogeneity persists throughout the course of formation

of travertine while preserving organic compounds in it.

Discussion

270

The presence of various organic identified through GC-MS-MS analysis such as β-alanine

271

derivatives, pyran-2-thione, TMS derivatives of formamide, cyclo-octane S8 sulphur, fatty acid

272

methyl esters, and siloxane derivatives in hot spring travertine deposits suggests a complex

273

interplay of biogenic and abiotic processes. These molecules may form through microbial

274

metabolic activities or abiotic geochemical pathways under specific environmental conditions

275

we propose plausible biogenic and abiotic formation reaction routes and provides suitable

276

putative hypothesis for the same.

277

5.1 Biomolecules from the hot spring and their traceability towards biogenic origin.

278

The presence of various organic compounds (Fig.3) identified substantiates that the hot spring

279

associated travertine deposit hosts the ingredients for early life to be triggered. These

280

molecules can form through microbial metabolic activities routes. The presence of these

281

molecules in hot spring travertine deposits also raises intriguing possibilities about their

282

biogenic origins.

283

To streamline the description of the samples, we divided the organic compounds into groups

284

based on their chemical function/structure and their biogenic potential

285

(i)

β-alanine derivatives: β-Alanine also known as 3-amino propanoic acid is a naturally

286

occurring amino acid and a key metabolite in various biochemical pathways (Yang et

287

al., 2023). Its derivatives in travertine deposits may suggest the involvement of

288

microbial or algal processes. β-Alanine is often associated as a part of microbial

289

metabolic byproducts (Song et al., 2023). Its presence in the travertine sample

290

supports the possibility of biogenic activity, as microbes in hot springs often produce

291

or metabolize amino acids (Zhang et al., 2023).

292

(ii)

Pyran-2-thione: Sulphur-containing heterocyclic compounds like pyran-2-thione can

293

be linked through microbial sulphur metabolism. Certain bacteria involved in sulphur

294

cycling (e.g., sulphate-reducing bacteria) might produce such compounds as

295

intermediates or byproducts. For instance, cyanobacteria, sulphur-oxidizing bacteria,

296

and other microbial communities found in hot springs contribute to biomineralization

297

and organic compound synthesis through their metabolic processes (Runge et al.,

298

2023).

(iii)

Formamide: Formamide is a simple organic compound and a precursor in abiotic

301

synthesis pathways for nucleic acids under prebiotic conditions. While suggestive of

302

prebiotic chemistry, it could also be a biogenic metabolite, although very rare. In some

303

microorganisms, formamide occurs as a degradation product of histidine and cyanide

304

(Ferber et al., 1988; Kunz et al., 1994; Wachsman and Barker, 1955).

305

(iv)

Cyclooctane S8 sulphur: Elemental sulphur is a significant intermediate in microbial

306

sulphur cycling, utilized or produced by sulphur-reducing and sulphur-oxidizing

307

microbes (Cosmidis et al., 2019). Microbial metabolism can involve the

308

transformation of sulphur into various forms, including cyclooctasulphur(S8) (Wang

et al., 2022). There are unique site where sulphur cycling significantly involves

310

microbial metabolisms, where transient cold springs are often covered in bright

311

sulphate and carbonate precipitates. The environment is characterized by a strong

312

hydrogen sulphide Odor, indicating active sulphur metabolism and microbial

313

processes. Similarly, presence of cyclooctane S8 sulphur in the travertine deposit from

314

the mouth of the vent of Puga hot spring where extreme cold conditions are persistent

315

throughout the year may strongly indicate microbial intervention. Generally,

316

solubility of cyclooctasulphur in aqueous system increases with increase in

317

temperature (Kamyshny, 2009). As Ladakh hosts wide diurnal variation in

318

temperature, thermal gradient is created near the mouth of the vent and across the hot

319

spring. Therefore, when hot water gushes out of from the vent it becomes cold and

320

makes the cyclooctane molecules to be precipitated in the travertine matrix. So,

321

presence of cyclooctane sulphur points toward cooling associated formation

322

mechanism, which drives the travertine formation not actual “hot” hot spring water.

323

Clearly the role of microbial involvement associated with cyclooctane sulphur

324

molecule needs to be explored further as abiotic chemical pathways can also be

325

responsible for formation of this molecule and ultimately its presence in the hot spring

326

deposit which will be discussed further in separate section (5.2) dedicated to abiotic

327

pathways.

334

creation of organic material through bacterial action (Malherbe et al., 2017). These

335

saturated fatty acids are commonly present in the lipid composition of cell membranes

336

and are essential components of glyco and phospholipids in bacteria (Jetter et al.,

337

2006). Typically, bacteria contain saturated fatty acids ranging from C-14 to C-18,

338

while algae contain saturated fatty acids ranging from C-16 to C-26, and plants contain

339

saturated fatty acids ranging from C-28 to C-36 respectively. The absence of long-

340

chain fatty acids in the travertine sample suggests that the bioindicators are

representation of metabolite derived from cyanobacterial and algae classes as reported

342

from previous studies (Hewelt-Belka et al., 2020; Kumari et al., 2013; Passos et al.,

343

2023).

344

The compounds discussed above may also form through inorganic geochemical reactions

345

driven by the high temperatures of hot spring water and the large thermal gradients induced by

346

extreme cold conditions. Additionally, high UV radiation, along with the mineral and water

347

chemistry in these environments, facilitates these reactions. They are influenced by factors such

348

as pH, temperature, and the presence of dissolved inorganic carbon and sulphur species, which

349

will be discussed and hypothesised with plausible reaction routes in the next section (5.2).

5.2 Exploration of biomolecules as Prebiotic Molecules in Calcium-Rich Travertine Hot
Springs in Cold Conditions

353

Travertine deposits, formed in hot spring environments, present a mineralogical context

354

conducive to prebiotic chemistry. Their calcium carbonate-rich composition provides a

355

reactive interface for the concentration, stabilization, and catalysis of organic molecules. Below

356

is an intriguing possibility and assessment of the role of the given molecules (beta-alanine

derivative, pyran-2-thione, formamide, cyclooctasulfur (S₈), and hexadecanoic methyl ester)

358

found in the Puga hot spring travertine sample as potential origin of life agents. We attempted

359

to provide general possible reaction route(s) by which these molecules may form in hot spring

360

conditions in the extreme cold environment of Ladakh.

Why do we care for formamide: Of all the organic molecules discovered in space so

369

far, formamide (NH2CHO) appears to be particularly promising when it comes to

370

addressing the question of the emergence of life on Earth, for several reasons. First, it

371

has an amide functional group (-N−C(=O)-), which is necessary to form chains of amino

372

acids and build up proteins. Second, it has been identified as a key precursor of a large

373

variety of prebiotic molecules (Saitta and Saija, 2014; Saladino et al., 2012a).

374

Formamide is also considered a plausible origin-of-life molecule under cold conditions

375

(López-Sepulcre et al., 2019), expanding its relevance beyond high-temperature

376

environments like hydrothermal vents (Ferus et al., 2022). There are plausible ways by

377

which formamide can be synthesised in-situ and near hot spring conditions (Terrestrial

378

conditions) and may react or degrade further via different mechanisms to form other

379

associated molecules (Fig.6).

382

Hydrothermal veins and a variety of pools and springs could mobilize and accumulate

383

many of the elements vital for prebiotic chemistry, such as C, H, N, O, P, S, B, Zn, Mn,

384

K, and others (Van Kranendonk et al., 2021). Presence of gases such as CO2,H2 CO,

385

CH4, N2, H2S are commonly present in thermal springs in varied concentrations (Hao

386

et al., 2020; Rinehart, 1980; Yu et al., 2022). In geothermal settings, nitrogen is mainly

387

present in its gaseous forms dinitrogen (N₂) and ammonia (NH₃(g) ) while in water it

388

appears as both ammonia (NH₃(aq)) and ammonium ions (NH₄⁺(aq)) (Holloway et al.,

389

2011). Presence of CN- ions are also reported in certain hot springs (Jawadi et al., 2021).

390

Hot springs have all the ingredients (elements) and recipe (temperature and pressure)

391

to make prebiotic molecules.

392

The temperature inside the Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India, can reach up to 160°C at

393

depths around 450 meters, with the surface temperature of the springs typically ranging

394

between 37°C and 90°C; the pressure within the reservoir is estimated to be around 2-

395

3 kg/sq.cm2 (Craig et al., 2013). Although concentration of formamide found in Puga

396

travertine sample is less it can be attributed due less contact time available for reactants

397

to react due to continues recycling of the water. The water is not stagnant, but instead

398

circulates and undergoes multiple cycles of evaporation to a dry state, followed by

399

rehydration from precipitation or periodic hot spring and geyser activity. The cycling

400

frequency is as short as minutes when caused by geyser splashing, hours due to

401

fluctuating levels of pools fed by pulses from hot springs, or days to weeks in cycles of

402

evaporation followed by precipitation. Therefore, formation of formamide may be

403

possibly route through two mechanism(s):

404

409
410

As hot water vents and cools, CO reacts with water in presence on ammonia/ammonium

411

ions on CaCO₃ surfaces to form formamide. In this process cold stabilization prevents

412

excess hydrolysis, maintaining detectable formamide concentrations. Rapid cooling

413

prevents formamide breakdown and CaCO₃ surfaces catalyse CO hydration efficiently.

414

Therefore, above proposed reactions for the formation of formamide generally entail

415

the presence of minerals, temperatures higher than 100 °C, and relatively high pH

416

values, which are compatible with hydrothermal vent conditions (Saladino et al.,

417

2012b).

418

Once formed formamide can act as a potential precursor to various prebiotic molecules

419

(Costanzo et al., 2007). Formamide serves as a versatile agent in prebiotic chemistry;

420

when it undergoes condensation and breakdown in the presence of minerals and metal

421

oxides, it produces biologically significant compounds like amino acids, cofactors,

422

nucleobases, and carboxylic acids (Costanzo et al., 2007; Saladino et al., 2012b; Wang

423

et al., 2013). Under certain conditions, formamide yields nucleosides such as adenine,

424

purine, hypoxanthine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil (Saladino et al., 2015). Interaction

425

of formamide with the hydrothermal vent mineral pyrite (FeS2) yields purine and

426

adenine which are basic components of nucleic acids (Saladino et al., 2008). Studies

427

also indicates that formamide can act as a solvent that facilitates the phosphorylation of

428

nucleosides into nucleotides (Furukawa et al., 2015) . Furthermore, degradation

429

products of formamide, formic acid, formaldehyde, HCN, ammonia, and COx serve as

430

substrates for the synthesis of other intermediates in prebiotic chemistry including

431

sugars (Civiš et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2011). Formamide is not only a parent

432

molecule but also an intermediate in a series of reactions from very reactive small

433

radicals to biologically significant molecules as implicated in Miller’s classical

434

experiment (Miller, 1953). Overall, formamide is a versatile compound in prebiotic

435

chemistry that can generate a range of monomers, from amino acids to nucleic acids.

436
437

(ii)

β-alanine derivatives: Beta-alanine (3-amino propanoic acid) is a fundamental amino

438

acid that acts as a precursor for peptides and a range of bioactive compounds. It can

439

participate in non-enzymatic peptide bond formation under prebiotic conditions

440

(Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020).

441

Within travertine, calcium ions may function as catalysts, promoting the condensation

442

of beta-alanine into oligopeptides. Furthermore, Beta-alanine may reacts with

443

formamide to yield dipeptides under mineral-catalysed conditions, mimicking

444

processes in icy or cold thermal gradients (Elmasry et al., 2021).

(Kitadai and Maruyama, 2018). Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) deposits act as a catalytic

surface, enhancing imine formation and promoting amino acid synthesis. Rapid cooling

450

prevents excess hydrolysis, allowing beta-alanine to accumulate on CaCO₃ surfaces.

451

Alkaline pH enhances the reaction by keeping NH₃ in its reactive form.

Pyran-2-thione: Sulphur-containing heterocycles like pyran-2-thione provide thiol

461

groups, essential for early metabolic pathways and redox reactions. Pyran-2-thione can

462

acts as a sulphur donor, forming thioesters with organic acids, as thioesters are

463

intermediates in energy transfer and peptide synthesis (Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2022;

464

Patel et al., 2015; Sanden et al., 2020). Geyserite and calcium minerals may stabilize

465

pyran-2-thione intermediates, enhancing reaction rates even at low temperatures.

466

Hot spring water in Ladakh contains dissolved sulphur species (H₂S, HS⁻) from

467

geothermal sources. Upon venting, exposure to oxygen and UV radiation promotes

468

oxidation and polymerization, forming sulphur-based heterocycles. Cold conditions

469

allow for slower hydrolysis and higher stabilization of pyran-2-thione intermediates.

470

Cold temperatures slow down competing side reactions, allowing thiolation to proceed

Cyclo-octasulphur (S₈): S₈ serves as a reservoir of elemental sulphur, participating in

480

sulphur cycling and redox reactions that are foundational for prebiotic chemistry. S₈

481

reacts with organic compounds in cold, mineral-rich conditions, producing thiols and

482

disulfides. These thiols can further form thioesters or participate in electron transfer

483

reactions (Cody et al., 2000; Patel et al., 2015). Calcium carbonate surfaces adsorb and

484

stabilize sulphur intermediates, facilitating redox processes (Baltrusaitis et al., 2007;

485

Claesson et al., 2024).

486

Cyclooctasulphur (S₈) Formation may occur via Oxidation of H₂S. Elemental sulphur

487

(S₈) forms through oxidation of H₂S as hot water meets oxygen. In colder conditions,

488

sulphur accumulates as stable rings rather than reactive chains. Cold water prevents over-

489

oxidation to sulphates, maintaining S₈. Surface deposition on CaCO₃ enables sulphur

cycling. Plausible reaction pathway as follows:

Hexadecanoic methyl ester: This fatty acid methyl ester can be a precursor to simple

495

membrane-like structures or micelles, essential for compartmentalization in early life.

496

The self-assembly of lipid bilayer membranes to enclose functional biomolecules, thus

497

defining a “protocell,” was a seminal moment in the emergence of life on Earth and

498

likely occurred at the micro-environment of the mineral-water interface (Sahai et al.,

499

2017). Vesicles composed of single-chain amphiphiles, like fatty acids, are thought to

500

have been key contributors to the emergence of life. Vesicles form most readily at

501

temperatures of ~70 °C and require salinity and strongly alkaline conditions to self-

502

assemble (Geisberger et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2021). Thus, alkaline hydrothermal

503

conditions not only permit protocell formation at the origin of life but actively favour it

504

(Jordan et al., 2019; Purvis et al., 2024). Hexadecanoic methyl ester self-assembles

505

into micelles or vesicles in cold aqueous environments, especially when trapped in

506

travertine micropores (Deamer, 2024; Monnard and Deamer, 2002). Calcium ions in

507

travertine stabilize the ester, facilitating interactions with other organic molecules and

508

promoting lipid bilayer formation (Balantič et al., 2022; Melcrová et al., 2016). CO

and H2 from hydrothermal sources undergo catalytic polymerization in the travertine.

Overall, we hypothesise that in a calcium-rich travertine system generated from an alkaline hot

520

spring environment in cold environment like Ladakh where there is large thermal gradient

521

created due to diurnal temperature variation along with high UV radiations at such high

522

altitude. The interplay between these molecules may yield complex prebiotic products. This

523

alanine (amino propanoic acids) and Formamide may form peptides or nucleotide precursors

524

via mineral-catalysed condensation. Pyran-2-Thione and Cyclooctasulphur may Contribute

525

sulphur atoms to thioesters, driving energy transfer reactions and hexadecanoic methyl ester

526

may encapsulates reaction products, forming protocellular structures.

529

We conclude that the travertine deposits from the Puga hot spring actively preserve a diverse

530

suite of organic compounds that hold significant implications for prebiotic chemistry. Our GC-

531

MS/MS analysis revealed a homogeneous distribution of key molecules including β-alanine

532

(amino propanoic acid) derivatives, formamide, pyran-2-thione, cyclooctasulphur, and

533

hexadecanoic methyl ester suggesting that plausibly both biotic and abiotic processes operate

534

in tandem under these conditions. Our work demonstrates that the rapid calcium carbonate

535

precipitation in this hydrothermal setting creates a stable matrix capable of capturing and

536

retaining molecular fingerprints, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar environments

537

could have nurtured the chemical evolution necessary for life on early Earth. We further

538

establish that the dynamic interplay between high-temperature geothermal reactions and rapid

539

cooling in a high UV, low-pressure atmosphere may promote complex prebiotic pathways

540

similar to that of Puga hot spring, Ladakh, India. These findings highlight the potential of

541

terrestrial hot springs as frameworks for early life and expand our understanding of similar

542

processes on other planetary bodies, ultimately laying a new perspective for future

543

astrobiological investigations into life's origins in extreme environments.
