Abstract: Water is an integral part for human survival but around 2.1 billion people do not have
excess to safe drinking water and 4.5 billion people lack proper sanitation. The human needs and
demands have built up the rapid growth of industrialization which alternatively has severely
affected the stability of water. In the case of Nagaland, there is a mass knowledge gap on water
related problems and its ill effects among locals which have not been identified to this extent.
Dimapur district of Nagaland being the fastest developing city of Nagaland has severely affected
major sources of water bodies but monitoring and documentation on the water bodies is very
scanty. In this article we have presented some articles from neighboring northeastern states of
India as Nagaland shares its boundary to these states and have similar geographical features.
Then secondary data from research articles of Nagaland was examined to understand the
contamination level in the region. Further statistical methods such as descriptive statistics,
Correlation, regression, factor analysis was analyzed on the secondary data to give a better
understanding on the behavior of water pollutants within the region.

Keywords: Water quality, Nagaland, Pollutants, Correlation, Regression.

Introduction
Water is essential for life and terrestrial life including humans need fresh water for survival.
According to WHO and UNICEF about 2.1 billion of people do not have excess to an improved
drinking water source and the number of children death under five due to diarrhea amounted to
526000 in 2015. However, Water pollution in India is a major problem. Due to industrialization
and urbanization, the problem seems to have risen higher and more gigantic. Nagaland is located
in the Northeastern part of India is ethnic with diverse tradition and cultural heritage. Rivers
forms an integral part of geography in Nagaland. In Nagaland the predominant source of drinking
water is from surface water such as river, streams, natural springs and ground water. The hilly
part of the region is entirely dependent on surface water whereas the plain area as such Dimapur
is dependent on ground water and surface water as well. Ground water is a major source for
drinking water and also used in agriculture and industry. The local people of Dimapur district
are predominantly dependent on ground water and surface water too. Dimapur district being the
fastest urbanization and industrialization of Nagaland state could lead to depletion of ground
water where rapid usage of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and dumping of sewage are seen day
to day. However, recent reports on water quality of Dimapur are very limited to best of our
knowledge. One major issue in Nagaland especially Dimapur district is the untreated municipal
waste dumped nearby rivers which causes not only ground and surface water deterioration but
also has an adverse effect on human health. No proper sanitation has been done so far in order to
curb the prevailing the dumping of waste. Therefore, systematic monitoring on ground water
bodies is required on a varied scale with quantitative assessment of different physicochemical
parameters, metal contamination and micro-biological characteristics. In this paper we have
presented research articles related to water pollution in the adjoining the areas of Nagaland viz.
Assam and Manipur due to its similar geography and geochemistry including available articles
related to water pollution of Nagaland. Statistics in an integral part used in many research fields
not only in business, government offices and hospital due to its large application of large data
reduction or helps in drawing a conclusion. Statistical methods have been implied in the articles
using the secondary data in order to draw the pattern of water contamination of Nagaland.

Literature review
The quality of ground and Surface water within a region is governed both by natural and
anthropogenic effects. It is also important to note the quality of groundwater is primarily used
for agricultural, domestic and Industrial purposes1. India is currently the world’s largest
consumer of groundwater and many researchers have focused on the contamination of
groundwater as well as surface water mainly due to its anthropogenic sources 2. Coal extractions

as in the case in India has contributed to wealth and employment but simultaneously exerted a
long lasting impact on the ecosystem leading to the degradation of soil and water bodies 3–5. The
contamination in the water bodies is evident by low pH, high sulphate, TDS, EC, Fe, Cd, Hg, Pb
and As concentration studied in Assam and Nagaland 6–8. However, the increasing anthropogenic
influences in recent years in urban, suburban, rural and catchment areas have potentially led to
deterioration in the water quality. The physico-chemical characteristics are substantially affected
due to discharge of municipal waste, domestic and industrial, recreational, religious offering etc.
Recent Research studies carried in the various parts of Manipur depicts that majority of the water
sample consists of high TDS, turbidity, total hardness, BOD, Na+, Cl-, phosphate, EC which is
mainly caused due to untreated domestic waste, disposal of solid waste making it unfit for
drinking (Alam and Gyanendra, 2017; Raj Kumar Bronson Singh et al., 2016; Singh and Dey,
2014; Singh et al., 2017). But the most common health risk associated with drinking water is
microbial contamination since it has the potential to cause large outbreak of water borne diseases.
Contamination in drinking water in India either by domestic, animal and human excreta is a
common factor. Untreated disposing of human excreta in many parts of Northeast India
especially Nagaland is one of the common problems which can lead to variety of water borne
diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery, skin infection, cholera, typhoid etc. Most of the water
bodies under investigation were contaminated with water-borne pathogenic bacteria either from
anthropogenic sources or socio-cultural activities as reported in Golaghat, Karbi-Anglong,
Dibrugarh, and Barak river of Assam 14–17.
Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid element which is present in air, food and water.
However, prolong exposure to arsenic cause’s diseases i.e. skin and lung cancer, keratosis,
melanosis, pigmentation etc. Drinking water is one of the pathways of exposure to arsenic and is
a major problem of global concern 18–20. Studies relating to arsenic contamination were observed
in six tea gardens of Lakhimpur district of Assam, India where a good number of water sample
contains arsenic at an alert and toxic level 21. Similar studies by different researcher on arsenic
pollution were also done on the different parts of Assam viz. Jorhat 22,23, Brahmaputra and Barack
flood plains24, Golaghat 25, Lakhimpur 26, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Kamrup, Nalbari and Darrang 27
depict the alarming high concentration of Arsenic which have been caused due to geogenic
origin. A recent report by UNICEF registered 18 out of the 23 districts were affected by ground
water arsenic toxicity. Studies relating to high Arsenic concentration was also observed in
Thoubal and Bishnupur district of Manipur 28, West Imphal district 10,and Imphal East, Imphal
west, Thoubal and Bishnupur district 29.
Fluorine is the most electronegative element and it is the thirteen most abundant elements in the
earth crust. Fluorine pollution is another major problem in India and its excessive intake beyond

1.5 mg/L causes a diseases fluorosis affecting more than half a million people in India and it is
mainly due to its natural sources 30–32. Studies relating to fluoride concentration have been carried
out by various researchers, unfolded that a good number of the water samples collected in the
various parts of Assam were contaminated with fluoride concentration above the permissible
limit viz Kamrup district 33,34 Dibrugarh district 35, Karbi-Anglong district36. It was evident that
the high fluoride concentration in various parts of Assam was due to geogenic origin and possible
chemical fertilizers containing fluoride impurities.
Heavy metals are the greatest threat to human health as they get absorbed in the human body
either from drinking water, food diet or by air. Studies on heavy metal contamination such as Cd,
Fe, Hg, Cr, and Pb can cause kidney dysfunction and induced cancer risk. Prolonged exposure
to heavy metals may also lead to disturb body’s metabolism, internal imbalance and may alter
central nervous system (CNS) function. Generally most of the heavy metals enter the water
bodies through erosion or anthropogenic sources 37,38. The heavy metal contamination in
groundwater either from natural or anthropogenic sources has raised concerns all over the world
due to its impact in public health39. Recent study on the soil contamination by heavy metal was
investigated in the Silghit region of Assam due to the untreated jute mill solid waste affecting
the soil quality of the region40. Contamination on the water bodies specially on ground water by
heavy metals in major parts of Assam were also investigated viz. Dhemaji district contaminated
with high concentration of Cr, Cu and Ni 41, East and west Karbi-Anglong district contaminated
with high Fe 36, Darrang district contaminated with Mn and Cd 42. Additionally, Guwahati city
was found to be contaminated with high Fe, Cr, Cd, Pb and Hg 43. Reports relating to metal
contamination in Manipur state suggested the major problem of contamination in the different
districts was due to Fe, Cu and Pb 10,44–46. Relevant studies on high Fe concentration was also
observed in Dimapur district of Nagaland exceeding two folds time their permissible limit47 (See
details in Table1-3).

Materials and Methods
The material used is a secondary data 48 identifying the patterns of various contaminants of
Nagaland. The water samples collected in the used article is either from spring, pond and well
water collected at a depth of 10-90 m. All the water samples were collected from the five districts
of Nagaland seasonally (summer and winter) for a period of three continuous years.

The studied area in the secondary data consist of the five district of Nagaland viz. Wokha,
Tuensang,

Zunheboto

(Lumami),

Kohima

(Tseminyu)

and

Mokokchung

(Ungma).

Geographically the five districts are situated as shown in table 4.

Methods
The above secondary dataset was analyzed using various statistical procedures.

Simple

summaries like mean, median, mode, variance, range, skewness and kurtosis of the various
physiochemical parameters were computed to ascertain the general level of abundance of the
corresponding contaminants in the state. The above summaries also reveal important information
useful in statistical modelling of the data.
Pairwise associations between the physiochemical parameters were measured using their
correlation coefficients. Correlation coefficient (r) is expressed as:
𝑟=

∑(𝑋 − 𝑋̅)(𝑌 − 𝑌̅)
√∑(𝑋 − 𝑋̅)2 × ∑(𝑌 − 𝑌̅)2

The correlation coefficient scale can be seen in Table 3. It is important to note that the
relationship between two sets of variables may be strong but not significant. Conversely, two
variables may be significant but show weak or no correlation at all. Linear regression attempts
to find the linear relationship between two variables by fitting a liner equation (y = ax + b) to
the observed data.
The relationship between the physiochemical parameters is further explored by a principal
component analysis (PCA). The correlation plots between the three significant principal
components with these parameters are inspected. These plots reveal various clusters among the
physiochemical parameters. Finally, the observations from the districts are subjected to a factor
analysis (FA). The analysis reveals two distinct identifiable latent factors, and two well separated
clusters among the districts. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS 25 (Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences) and R software version 4.1.2. More details about the PCA and
FA can be found in 49.

Results and Discussion
It is observed from the secondary data of (Tiakaba et. al.) that the physiochemical parameters
were collected from five districts of Nagaland and the various physiochemical parameters which
were analyzed for three years seasonally. Then the values of the various parameters were
compressed to their mean value manually for further statistical analysis as shown in Table 4.
Based on the mean observation Table 6 indicates the presence of low pH and high concertation
of Fe, Pb and Cu according to BIS standards. After the conversion to their mean (Table 4), the

characteristic statistical values were also calculated using the IBM SPSS 20.1 statistical software
as shown in table 5. Results obtained from descriptive statistical analysis (Table 5) reveals the
presence of high concentration of Cu and Pb as per the permissible limit. Herein, the high
concentration of Cu and Pb could possibly be explained by the presence of mineral deposition
embedded in the earth crust or geogenic composition in the region. In addition, anthropogenic
activities have very little influence over the presence of high concentration of Cu and Pb.
The correlation coefficient values for different water quality parameters are shown in table 6.
The correlation study among the various parameters were calculated and the values indicated
very strong positive relation observed between the concentration of EC and TDS (r=
0.971/1.000), Ni and TDS (r=0.927/1.000), Ni and EC (r=0.933/1.000). A high positive
relationship among trace metals was observed between the concertation of Cu and Zn
(r=0.959/1.000), and Fe and Cd (r=0.961/1.000). The positive or negative correlations between
trace metals in different compartments depend on environmental/ geographical factors such as
biological activities, chemical composition, and physical features which occurs in the natural
aquatic habitats or surrounding. Moreover, the release of pollutants either by natural process as
well as anthropogenic activities has very strong impacts on the metal’s concentration and
distribution in the aquatic environment. Other factors could be explained by the presence of soil
organic matter which seeps into the aquatic environment later contributing and controlling the
bioavailability, mobility and bioaccumulation of heavy metals It is important to note that
correlation values between variables cannot conclusively prove causation during interpretation
of correlation coefficient values, as it gives only a degree of relationship between variables.
DO is the amount of gaseous oxygen (O2) dissolved in water. Out of the 15-correlation coefficient
value, DO show a strong correlation with total hardness (r=0.811/1.000) and COD (r=
0.698/1.000) with a strongly negative correlation with Fe (r= -0.737/1.000) and Cd (r= 0.866/1.00). DO also showed relatively moderate relationship with EC, TDS and COD along
with a weak and negative relationship for majority of the heavy metals except for Ni
(r=0.503/1.000), and As (r= 0.594/1.000). pH as such, is a very decisive variable to study the
lessening of heavy metals concentration in solution due to formation of precipitates. Herein, pH
showed a high positive relation with As (r= 0.836/1.000), weak and moderate relationship with
Ag (r= 0.170/1.000), Ni (r= 0.350/1.000), and Mn (r= 0.554/1.000). In addition, pH also showed
very strong negative relationship with other metal \ in the order of negative correlation values Fe
˃ Zn ˃ Cu ˃ Cd ˃Pb.
BOD showed a quantitative strong relationship with EC (r=0.750/1.000), TDS (r=0.718/1.000),
weak relation with DO (0.394) and a negative relationship with pH (r= -0.425/1.000). As per the
correlation value, BOD showed positive relationship with all the parameters, except for Mn, it

showed a strong negative relation (r= -0.405/1.000). The values for total hardness (TH) showed
a strong relationship with EC (r=0.703/1.000), TDS (r=0.710/1.000), DO (r=0.811/1.000), COD
(r=0.647/1.000), Mn (r=0.718/1.000), Ni (r=0.793/1.000) and a moderate relationship with As
(r=0.513/1.000). Additionally, a weak correlation and negative correlation for metal with the
maximum negative value was observed for Cd (r= -0.670/1.000) and Fe (r= -0.593/1.000). Also,
the relationship between COD and heavy metals showed quiet a positive degree of relationship
with Cu (r= 0.600/1.000), Ni (r= 0. 603/1.000) and Zn (r= 0.582/1.000). However, the negative
relationship was also observed with Fe, Cd and Pb which is in the order as: Fe (r= -0.045/1.000)>
Cd (r= -0.282/1.000) > Pb (r= -0.017/1.000).
The observed correlation values among heavy metals indicates 17 out of 36 values showed
negative relationship with maximum negative relationship between As and Zn (r= -0.792/1.000).
Majority of the positive correlation values showed weak and moderate correlation as such
between Pb and Zn (r= 0.102/1.000), Cd and Zn (r= 0.300/1.000), Ag and As (r= 0.408/1.000),
Cu and Fe (r= 0.365/1.000), Ag and Ni (r= 0.362/1.000), Fe and Zn (r= 0.540/1.000), Mn and
Ni (r= 0.536/1.000). In addition, As showed negative relation with all the other metal except for
Mn (r= 0.165/1.000), Ag (r=0.408/1.000) and Ni (r=0.492/1.000). Strong positive relationship
was also observed between Pb and Fe (r= 0.686/1.000), Pb and Cd (r= 0.749/1.000), Ag and Pb
(r= 0.601/1.000). Pb only showed negative relation with As (r= -0.258/1.000) and Cu (r= 0.178/1.000). Interestingly, Ni showed no negative relation with the physiochemical parameters,
while Cd showed the most negative relation with the physiochemical parameters (pH, EC, TDS,
DO and COD). Also, among all the metal, TDS showed negative relation with Cd (r= 0.090/1.000).
Factor analysis is an important statistical tool that strives to compute variables and explain the
extent of correlations among numerous outcomes from various pollutant which possibly explain
the result as one or more underlying factors. The obtained factor analysis from Table 6 shows
interconnected results between variables as shown in Fig 1a- 1c. Herein, pH and Arsenic show
close relationship. The presence of arsenic in water bodies is mostly explained by geogenic
origin. Nonetheless, the relationship could extent and variably explain the existence of high As
occurs on high pH value which is well-established by various research finding. The relationship
between Cu and Zn closeness which is mostly by the presence of Zn and Cu in the soil or mineral
form. Additionally, the relationship between Fe and Cd was could also be ascertain through
geogenic origin. The close relationship between DO and TDS indicate high TDS with low DO.
The levels of changes between these parameters potentially act as an index to eutrophic activity
in the water bodies. Also, very strong association between TDS and EC was obtained. TDS
concentration primarily describes the presence of small amount of organic matter and inorganic

salts in water and EC measures the water capacity to conduct electrical current. The sources of
material in EC and TDS are either from geological condition of water or soil or by anthropogenic
human activities.
Factor analysis in Fig. 1d results from principal component analysis of 16 variables indicate the
MR2 (V4 - Kohima district) shows total deviation from the other four districts MR1 (V1, V2,
V3, V5). It may be understood that the analysis results possibly could establish that increase
population and rapid urbanization increases demand in the supply chain leads to greater waste
generation. The presence of mineral deposition embedded in the earth surface crust or geogenic
composition in the region can also be a key factor. Anthropogenic activities by humans with
increasing urbanization cannot be ruled out as it is the major component towards any sources of
pollution. Unethical and improper dumping of waste and human excreta in the area have been
identified till today. In addition, Comparatively, the other four districts have lesser population
density which might possibly could resulted the deviation of MR4 with the rest. Another factor
may be due to the nature of mineral composition in the area occurred through geogenic origin
which could have entered the natural habitat via natural calamities, floods, landslides etc.

Conclusion
Water makes up as an integral part for human survival, industrial, domestic household and
agricultural activities. The human pressure on the natural habitat has severely affected the
stability and quality of water. As per Nagaland, there is a mass knowledge gap on water related
problems and its ill effects among locals which have not been identified to this extent. Although
all 12 districts of Nagaland are still in the developing and growing state, but the extent of water
pollution and scarcity are clearly being seen as of today. Majority of the perennial streams in this
data shows high concentration of Cu and Pb primarily due to geogenic origin. Also, results from
the factor analysis suggest the total deviation of V4 (MR2) from the other four districts (V1, V2,
V3, V5). Such deviation could have been led by rapid urbanization and also due to geographical
features, and geogenic nature of the earth’s mineral composition. Thus, severely affected sources
of water bodies are in much need for continuous monitoring and documentation to avoid spread
of various ailments. Through this article, the importance of neighboring northeastern states of
India which shares its boundary with Nagaland can possibly give an insight in the water pollution
due to similarities in the geographical features. Additionally, using statistical method on
secondary based data from research articles of Nagaland can justify the behavior of
contamination level and how each district or region vary with the other.
