Abstract

2

Catalytic production of chlorine atoms from iron salt aerosols has been suggested as

3

a means of achieving atmospheric methane removal. The feasibility of this approach,

4

its efficiency and the optimum conditions for deployment must be determined, but this

5

is not straightforward as the mechanism involves interlocking nonlinear atmospheric

6

free radical chain reactions; under some conditions added chlorine is known to increase

7

methane lifetime. Here we evaluate the catalytic efficiency of atmospheric methane

8

oxidation under different conditions, initiated by the photocatalytic conversion of chlo-

9

ride to chlorine by iron chlorides Fe(III)Cln

using a box model. While HOx and

10

high NOx behaviors are well known, a new regime for tropospheric chemistry is found

11

and described, one characterized by high ClOx conditions. We find that at chlorine

12

production rates below 1×106 Cl2 /(cm3 s) and ambient NOx and O3 levels of 4–80

13

ppt NOx at 14 ppb O3 , 8–180 ppt NOx at 30 ppb O3 and 14–200 ppt NOx at 40 ppb

14

O3 the net effect on CH4 is negative, increasing CH4 concentrations. This variation

15

is driven by the formation and hydrolysis of ClONO2 leading to loss of O3 and NO2 .

16

At high rates of Cl2 addition the reaction of CH3 OOH with Cl becomes the major

17

source of OH and CH4 is removed. At elevated ClOx, ClO· usurps the role of NO in

18

converting HO2 to OH, and CH3 O2 to CH3 O. The efficiencies seen in the model range

19

from -0.62 to 2.81 CH4 /Cl. The modeling shows that due to the dispersion of a ship’s

20

plume into low NOx conditions, iron emitted by ships is likely to increase the lifetime

21

of atmospheric methane.

Introduction

23

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for >1/3 of global warming since pre-

24

industrial times; 1 its atmospheric burden continues to increase with a new record set every

25

year for over a decade. 2 The IPCC emissions pathways that prevent 1.5 °C of global warming

26

by 2050 require large reductions of methane emissions. 1 The obvious strategy would be to

27

reduce emissions from the largest methane sources including agriculture, fossil fuels, and

28

waste and wastewater. However, according to Höglund-Isaksson et al., emissions reduction

29

is limited to 30-45% by 2030 and 50% by 2050 using known technologies. Moreover, emis-

30

sions from natural sources including wetlands, permafrost, thermokarst lakes and bacterial

31

processes are likely to increase with increasing global temperature. 4–6 Wetland emissions

32

could increase by 22 to 149% by 2100, becoming larger than anthropogenic emissions in

33

most scenarios. 7 Already, about half of the increased methane concentration in 2020 can be

34

attributed to wetland emissions. 6

35

Due to the challenge of reducing atmospheric methane in the face of increasing anthro-

36

pogenic and natural emissions, it may be necessary to develop method/s to remove methane

37

from the atmosphere, similar to carbon dioxide removal. 8–10 According to recent work, at-

38

mospheric methane removal has the potential to reduce global average temperature by 0.4-1

39

°C. 11–13 The IPCC concluded that the field is in its infancy. 1

40

Photocatalytic generation of chlorine by iron salt aerosols (ISA) has been suggested

41

as a method for achieving cost-effective atmospheric methane removal. 14,15 The method

42

has been demonstrated in the laboratory. 16–19 In addition to the low technology readiness

43

level there are important questions regarding the safety, efficacy, appropriate conditions for,

44

and especially the governance of any such approach. 20 It was recently shown that the ISA

45

mechanism is active over the North Atlantic in Mineral Dust-Sea Spray Aerosols (MDSA)

46

created when particles from the Sahara descend into the marine boundary layer (MBL). 21

47

Unexpectedly, MDSA is the largest source of oxidized chlorine (Cl2 and Cl) in this region.

48

The largest anthropogenic source of iron in the MBL is shipping, arising from impurities in

49

fuel. This source was estimated at <16 Gg(Fe)/yr in 2001. 22 These anthropogenic emissions

50

of soluble iron will likely mix with sea-salt aerosols, creating ISA that would produce chlorine,

51

possibly removing methane. 14,23 Herrmann and coauthors have summarized research on the

52

photochemistry of aqueous iron complexes including a wide variety of inorganic and organic

53

ligands. 24 Additionally, Hoffmann and coauthors constructed a detailed model of marine

54

multiphase chemistry for air quality in polluted coastal areas. 25 In particular, the simulations

55

indicate significant influence of Cl atoms on the oxidation of volatile organic compounds.

the HOx, NOx and ClOx cycles’ interactions and their effect on O3 concentrations. Bottom,
methane oxidation mechanism, including HOx (green), NOx (red) and ClOx (blue) species.

56

Previous research has shown that while Cl· can be important in initiating oxidation of

57

methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds, 26 a higher rate of Cl· production does

58

not necessarily lead to a reduction in methane as the additional Cl· can suppress methane

59

removal by OH· . 21,27,28 This is because OH· production depends on O3 and NO2 , both of

60

which are removed by ClOx, see Figure 1, top. However, the negative impact of lower

61

OH· concentrations on methane removal can be overcome with sufficiently high rate of Cl2

62

addition. 28 It is important to consider these effects when evaluating the impact of iron from

63

shipping on methane, especially as NOx plays an important role in the mechanism and ships

64

co-emit NOx with iron.

65

In this paper, we use a photochemical box model to evaluate the impact of adding Cl2

66

to the troposphere on methane removal for a wide range of parameters extending from a

67

concentrated nascent shipping exhaust plume to the ambient atmosphere. We assess the

68

impact as methane removal per added Cl2 at different atmospheric NOx levels.

Method

70

A box model that runs a diurnal cycle and constant NOx input was built in the Kinte-

71

cus environment. 29 The model contains the radical cycles and the oxidation of CH4 and

72

dimethyl sulfide (DMS), as it impacts NOx at night. 30 The mechanisms and rates of these

73

reactions were obtained from the Master Chemical Mechanism, MCM v3.3.1, 31–33 via web-

74

site: www.mcm.york.ac.uk. The model uses a reduced VOC chemistry but contains the key

75

elements to describe the system, specifically the interlocking free radical chain reactions, see

76

Figure 1, top. The model includes the ClOx reactions and key deposition rates. Furthermore,

77

bromine and iodine chemistry was included due to their importance in the MBL. 34–37

78

A full listing of the initial conditions and the reactions and their sources can be found

79

in the Supporting Information (SI). Photolysis reactions not included in the MCM sub-

80

scheme are obtained from the NCAR TUV calculator. 38 NOx and O3 are constrained via

81

fixed emissions of NO2 and O(3 P) rather than fixed concentrations. 39 This allows for the

82

evaluation of the impact of the radical chemistry on methane. Constraining O3 gives more

83

realistic levels due to the mixing of the atmosphere. Thus, an additional first order loss rate

84

of O3 is added at high NOx as well.

85

The model is run for 16 days to reach stable concentrations for key species like O3 and

86

NOx. Next, Cl2 is added (’A’ for 1 day at a maximum rate rA,Cl2 depending linearly on

87

solar intensity I(t). The model is run for 15 additional days to let it relax to baseline

88

concentrations. CH4 oxidation initiated by OH· and Cl· is tracked during the 16-day period

89

after Cl2 release starts and compared with the same model run with no addition of chlorine,

90

i.e. rA,Cl2 =0. CH4 removal is divided by total Cl emission nT,Cl to derive CH4 removal per

91

Cl. The total emission is given by:

radical chain efficiency.

95

The model output was benchmarked against the Community Earth System Model (CESM)

96

by Meidan et al. by converting Cl2 emission rates to daily average Cl2 mixing ratios, see SI.

97

The CESM output for the North Pacific (NP) and North Atlantic (NA) regional boxes were

98

used.

99

Ozone production efficiency, ϵO3

100

The ozone production efficiency, ϵO3 , is defined as the rate of O3 production (’P ’) (rP,O3 )

101

divided by the rate of NOx loss (’L’) (rL,NOx ): ϵO3 = rP,O3 /rL,NOx . 41 The photolysis of NO2

102

will produce O3 , however, NO2 is also lost to oxidation to nitrate r = k[NO2 ][OH· ][M], see

103

Figure 1, top. The balance between the rate of photolysis and the rate of HNO3 formation

104

determines ϵO3 . This number depends on local conditions and is mainly driven by solar

105

intensity, temperature and [OH· ].

106

Values of ϵO3 over the United States are typically in the range 1-20. In the remote

107

troposphere, where NOx levels are very low, ϵO3 is much higher and can even exceed 100. 41

108

O3 -OH· production efficiency, βO3

109

The O3 -OH· production efficiency, βO3 , is defined as the total rate of O3 loss divided by

110

T ot
N oon
the production rate of OH at midday: βO3 = rL,O3
/rP,OH
. OH· is produced through the

111

photolysis of O3 followed by reaction with water:
O3 + hν → O2 + O( 1D)

(R1)

O( 1D) + M → O( 3P) + M

(R2)

O( 3P) + O2 + M → O3 + M

114

O( 1D) + H2 O → 2 OH·

(R4)

115

Reaction (R1) does not always lead to loss of O3 due to reactions (R2) and (R3). O3 is lost

116

in (R4) to yield two OH· radicals. Other loss reactions for O3 include reactions with HOx

117

and NOx as well as deposition:

O3 + HO2 → OH· + 2 O2

(R5)

O3 + OH· → HO2 + O2

(R6)

O3 + NO → O2 + NO2

(R7)

O3 + NO2 → O2 + NO3

(R8)

118

119

120

121

while photolysis of NO2 from (R7) produces O3 via (R3), closing a null cycle, the competing

122

formation of HNO3 should be included in loss rate of O3 , rL,O3 . Addition of Cl· creates an

123

additional loss for O3 through (R9), reducing βO3 .

Cl + O3 → ClO + O2

(R9)

124

Radical chain length, νOH

125

Methane is oxidized in a nonlinear chain reaction where OH· is both reagent and product,

126

see Figure 1, bottom. Due to these feedbacks, an additional OH· can ultimately cause more

127

than one OH· reaction. 42 This amplification is described by the radical chain length, defined

128

as the rate of loss of OH· divided by the rate of OH· primary production via (R1)-(R4):

129

νOH = rPL,OH
. At steady state rL,OH = rP,OH where rP,OH is the rate of production of OH· by
P,OH

130

all processes.

131

In high-NOx conditions the CH4 oxidation chain reaction produces one NO2 and three

132

HO2 radicals, which together produce four OH· through reactions (R3),(R10) and (R11),

replacing OH· lost to reaction and producing additional ozone, increasing OH· : 43

HO2 + NO → OH· + NO2

(R10)

NO2 + hν → NO + O

(R11)

134

135

followed by (R3). In low-NOx conditions the mechanism only produces one HO2 . With-

136

out (R10) HO2 increases, forming H2 O2 and terminating the chain. The radical chain length

137

is thus much shorter under low-NOx conditions making the efficiency of CH4 removal by

138

OH· much lower.

139

Results and Discussion

140

The model yields stable concentrations over the full time-period and the results are repro-

141

ducible. The modeled OH· concentration over the entire NOx range, [OH· ] = 6.5 ×106 to

142

2.2×107 cm−3 , is slightly higher than the literature, 7×105 to 2.9×106 cm−3 , which can be

143

attributed to the limited VOC chemistry in the box model. 44–46 In comparable conditions,

144

there is good agreement with Edwards and Young, see SI. The box model and the CESM 40

145

output show similar NOx and O3 depletion with increasing Cl2 emissions. Additionally,

146

ClONO2 is also in good agreement, with slightly higher concentrations in CESM, suggesting

147

the hydrolysis rate used in our box model is in the same order of magnitude as the NP and

148

NA locations in CESM. Furthermore, H2 O2 concentrations increase similarly in both models,

149

as well as HOCl and CH3 OOH which are indicative of the high-ClOx regime, see SI S8. The

150

agreement between CESM and the box model provides high confidence in the conclusions

151

based on the box model investigation.

152

Sensitivity analyses are performed for the ClONO2 hydrolysis rate, due to the variability

153

in the aerosol surface area in the MBL, and for the effect of additional ozone sources and

154

sinks. The effect of iodine and bromine chemistry is discussed in SI, and was found to only

have a minor impact.

156

Ozone production efficiency, ϵO3

157

In the model, NOx is mainly lost through reaction with OH· giving HNO3 . The large addition

158

of Cl· introduces another loss mechanism for NO2 via formation of ClONO2 which can either

159

be photolyzed back to ClO· and NO2 or hydrolyze forming HNO3 :

ClO + NO2 + M → ClONO2 + M

(R12)

ClONO2 + H2 O(l) → HNO3 + HOCl

(R13)

160

161

H2 O(l) is high in the MBL so (R13) is very fast with a rate limited by the diffusion

162

of ClONO2 to a particle. The HOCl formed in (R13) can be photolyzed to OH· and Cl· or

163

absorbed by particles, where it can react either with HCl/Cl− to form Cl2 18,35 or be deposited

164

with the particle.

165

Increased chlorine addition increases the rate of NOx loss rL,NOx , decreasing the ozone

166

production efficiency ϵO3 . Figure S1 shows the ozone production efficiency as a function of

167

xNOx and rA,Cl2 (peak rate at noon). Very large addition of Cl2 reduces ϵO3 by an order of

168

magnitude, from >100 to the range of 10 to 30.

169

The NOx lost under high Cl· conditions reduces O3 production. While the reduction of

170

tropospheric O3 and NOx pollution is desirable for health and the environment, it results in

171

lower OH· production from O3 via (R1) and (R4).

172

O3 -OH· production efficiency, βO3

173

The O3 -OH· production efficiency, βO3 , as a function of the NOx mixing ratio xNOx and rA,Cl2

174

is shown in Figure S2. βO3 is highest at low NOx and low-Cl2 conditions, with a maximum

175

of 0.84 mol OH· /mol O3 . Under these conditions the photolysis of O3 followed by reaction

176

with H2 O to form OH· is the main O3 sink, see Figure S3 which illustrates the O3 sinks at

177

low and high NOx. The lowest βO3 values are found for high-NOx and high-Cl2 conditions

178

which suppress O3 , preventing OH· formation. βO3 increases above rA,Cl2 ≈ 106 Cl2 /(cm3 s)

179

as Cl· reacts with NO, decreasing this loss of O3 . Above this range most O3 is lost by (R9),

180

decreasing rP,OH , but increasing the radical chain length, described in the next section.

181

Radical chain length, νOH

182

The main OH· sink reactions at high and low NOx are shown in the top of Figure 2 as a

183

function of rA,Cl2 . OH· loss increases sharply with increasing Cl2 addition in low NOx/high

184

ClOx conditions. This does not necessarily mean that [OH· ] will decrease as the radical
chain length νOH could increase due to increased OH· production by other mechanisms.

The main sources of OH· for low- and high-NOx conditions, with increasing rA,Cl2 , are

shown at the bottom of Figure 2. OH· from O3 (O(1 D)+H2 O) is suppressed at high rA,Cl2

188

due to (R9). However, alternative OH· sources at high rA,Cl2 become dominant, increasing

189

νOH . In low-NOx conditions reaction (R14) becomes the main OH· source above 106 Cl2

190

/(cm3 s) while at high NOx the photolysis of HOCl becomes the dominant source of OH· as

191

rA,Cl2 increases, followed by (R14) at the very highest rA,Cl2 .

Cl· + CH3 OOH → HCl + CH2 O + OH·

(R14)

192

The OH· chain length at peak sunlight as a function of xN Ox and rA,Cl2 is shown in Figure

193

S4. As expected νOH is shorter in low-NOx conditions, <2, as methane oxidation is forced

194

through the HOx pathway, see Figure 2. For high-NOx conditions νOH increases to 2.2-5.2.

195

Above 1×107 Cl2 /(cm3 s) there is a dramatic increase in νOH , due to additional OH· sources

196

from Cl· chemistry, see Figure 2 bottom.

197

Although the formation of ClO· in (R9) decreases OH· by consuming O3 , ClO· can reform

198

O3 and ClO· can make the methane oxidation cycle more efficient. An overview of the

199

interactions is shown in Figure S5. At low-NOx, the ClO· reaction with CH3 O2 (R15)

200

is substantial, providing an alternative to the low NOx pathway, see Figure 1, bottom.

201

Moreover, a substantial fraction of ClO· reacts with HO2 , (R16), converting it into OH·

202

through the formation and photolysis of HOCl.

ClO + CH3 O2 → Cl· + HCHO + HO2

(R15)

ClO + HO2 → HOCl + O2

(R16)

203

204

At high NOx conditions ClO· mainly reacts with NO and NO2 , depleting NOx, which

205

can lead to low NOx conditions. The reaction of ClO· with NO produces NO2 which can be

206

photolyzed, reforming the O3 used to make ClO· . Even at low-NOx conditions this reaction

207

will occur and represents 10% of the total loss of ClO· for rA,Cl2 below 4×104 Cl2 /(cm3 s).

208

CH4 removal

209

The overall efficiency of the mechanism depends on the three parameters introduced above:

210

the O3 production efficiency ϵO3 , the O3 -OH· production efficiency βO3 and the radical chain

211

length νOH . The combined impact is seen by calculating the change in [CH4 ] per emitted

212

Cl atom over the simulation period, see Figure 3. The effect of added Cl2 depends strongly

213

on xNOx and rA,Cl2 . At xNOx < 4 ppt (4×10-12 mol/mol) or > 180 ppt (1.8×10-10 mol/mol)

214

the effect is always positive, removing additional CH4 . Between these xNOx levels and below

215

1×106 Cl2 /(cm3 s), ∆[CH4 ] is negative, i.e. [CH4 ] increases. This range is dependent on the

216

ClONO2 hydrolysis rate, see below. The most favorable regime is for xNOx > 1 ppb (1×10-9

217

mol/mol), where as many as 2.81 CH4 can be removed per Cl. Comparing with the CESM

218

output from Meidan et al., the same unfavorable NOx range can be observed, but extends

219

up to 1×107 Cl2 /(cm3 s). Differences between the CESM and the box model could be due

220

to the wide fluctuation of NOx/O3 and Cl2 emission in CESM, or due to the added VOC

221

chemistry included in CESM.

Figure 3: CH4 removed per added Cl (mol/mol) as a function of xNOx and maximum rA,Cl2 ,
split over the days when the impact is observed and a total time of 16 days. The darkest
pink ranges from -0.62 to -0.4 and the darkest green ranges from 0.5 to 2.81

222

While changes to νOH occur during emission, the impacts of O3 loss continue for at least

223

a day and the impact of NOx loss continues for several days. This is seen in the CH4

224

removal per day shown in Figure 3. On the day of Cl2 emission CH4 removal, increases in

225

all scenarios. However, on day 2 the impact of O3 loss leads to an increase in [CH4 ] in all

226

scenarios except high NOx and high rA,Cl2 . For days 3-16, overall, the loss of NOx leads to

227

lower O3 formation and lower OH· production, resulting in increased [CH4 ] for all conditions

228

except high NOx with low rA,Cl2 and very low NOx. Thus, the impact of rA,Cl2 cannot be

229

judged just based on measurements on the day of emission, but needs to take several days

230

after emission into account.

231

Sensitivity Analyses

232

ClONO2 hydrolysis rate sensitivity analysis

233

Reaction of ClO· with NO2 will produce ClONO2 which can hydrolyze yielding HOCl and

234

HNO3 . The HNO3 will most likely be deposited and thereby the reaction represents the main

235

loss of NOx due to Cl2 addition. The hydrolysis rate of ClONO2 , however, is dependent on

236

particle surface area density, which changes over orders of magnitude. The rate has been ap-

237

proximated as a first order reaction and the sensitivity of the model was tested by evaluating

238

CH4 removal per Cl atom added, when the total emission is 1500 Cl2 molecules/(cm3 s), see

Figure S6. Deiber et al. reported a ClONO2 uptake coefficient of 0.02 on water and NaCl

240

solution. Using a thermal velocity of 277 m/s and a sea spray aerosol surface area density

241

in the range of 1 – 50 µm2 /cm3 (depending on wind speed) 48 results in a first order loss rate

242

for ClONO2 hydrolysis ranging from 5.5×10−6 s-1 to 2.8×10−4 s-1 , and hydrolysis rates may

243

be further increased due to mineral dust or emitted iron salt aerosols. Therefore, we used an

244

average value of 10−4 s-1 in our model (corresponding to 20 µm2 /cm3 surface area density),

245

and we performed a sensitivity analysis covering the range of 10−3 s-1 to 10−6 s-1 .

246

The hydrolysis rate competes with the photolysis rates of 10-5 s-1 , producing Cl and NO3 ,

247

and 10-6 s-1 , producing ClO· and NO2 again. A fast hydrolysis rate will therefore result in

248

a higher NOx removal, which in turn will decrease the O3 production and the following

249

OH production. Ultimately, this will lead to increasing CH4 concentrations when the NOx

250

mixing ratio is between 4–200 ppt (4×10-12 –2×10-10 mol/mol) with a hydrolysis rate of 10-3

251

s-1 . This is in agreement with the findings reported by Edwards and Young. 39 In contrast,

252

decreasing the hydrolysis rate to 10-5 s-1 will result in CH4 removal at all NOx mixing ratios.

253

Sensitivity to additional ozone sources and sinks

254

The reduction of ozone due to the addition of chlorine atoms to the atmosphere is highly

255

relevant for our conclusions. We performed a sensitivity analysis using an extra source of

256

ozone and an extra sink of ozone in the box model, see Figure 4. A sensitivity analysis

257

was performed without constraining O3 with additional sources or sinks, which resulted in

258

relatively low O3 at low NOx, and relatively high O3 at high NOx, and the resulting methane

259

removal per Cl was in line with the simulations where O3 was constrained. The sensitivity

260

analysis shows that increasing O3 leads to less CH4 removal in high-NOx conditions and

261

more removal in low-NOx conditions. Increasing [CH4 ] is found between 4–80 ppt NOx at

262

14 ppb O3 , 8–180 ppt NOx at 30 ppb O3 and 14–200 ppt NOx at 40 ppb O3 .

and O3 mixing ratios, with rA,Cl2 =1500 Cl2 /(cm3 s).

263

Relevance for ship emissions

264

Iron present in fuel or additives is emitted as part of a ship’s plume. As the plume disperses,

265

iron containing particles will mix with sea spray aerosols, forming ISA. These aerosols could
14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-3r8sf-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0008-2225-3371 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

266

potentially produce high intensity Cl2 emissions within the high NOx conditions of the

267

plume. However, ship plumes disperse rapidly, reducing the concentration of the ISA and

268

NOx by orders of magnitude, while spreading the aerosols over a very large area. Typically,

269

the dispersion into the background will occur within a day, but the ISA could have a total

270

atmospheric lifetime of several days, depending on particle size. 49 This implies that the

271

impact of the shipping iron emission is driven by the local, ambient NOx concentrations

272

where the plume disperses.

273

Based on Figure 3 it can be seen that low rA,Cl2 leads to an increase in [CH4 ] for xNOx

274

from 4-180 ppt, while Figure 4 shows that this range is shifted higher with increasing [O3 ].

275

This results in increased [CH4 ] between 4–80 ppt NOx at 14 ppb O3 , 8–180 ppt NOx at 30

276

ppb O3 and 14–200 ppt NOx at 40 ppb O3 . Figure 5 shows the areas where these conditions

277

occur in red, based on the yearly average from the CESM global model output for 2023.

278

The model description can be found in Meidan et al.. Most of the world has unfavorable

279

background NOx and O3 concentrations, which means that shipping iron emissions are likely

280

to increase methane levels. One exception is a region in the North Atlantic, which explains

281

why mineral dust in this region was able to effectively remove methane from the atmosphere,

282

as shown by van Herpen et al.. A constant rate of 10-4 s-1 for the ClONO2 hydrolysis has

283

been used for this analysis. However, the local aerosol surface area density is dependent on

284

wind speed, resulting in faster and slower hydrolysis rates regionally. As discussed above,

285

this will have an impact on the methane removal.

286

Conclusion

287

In this paper we have explored a new domain of tropospheric chemistry, the high ClOx

288

regime. The results of the study show clearly that the impact of chlorine added to the

289

atmosphere depends critically on ambient conditions. Initial chlorine can increase methane

290

lifetime via its effects on ozone and NOx, the primary and secondary sources of the main

291

methane oxidant, OH· . The impact of chlorine depends on the amount of NOx present. We

292

have identified the range of NOx and O3 concentrations, 4–80 ppt NOx at 14 ppb O3 , 8–180

293

ppt NOx at 30 ppb O3 and 14–200 ppt NOx at 40 ppb O3 , where Cl2 emissions below 1×106

294

/(cm3 s) lead to an increase of CH4 lifetime. Cl2 emissions above this threshold always lead

295

to net CH4 removal. At such high Cl2 additions CH3 OOH + Cl· becomes the dominant OH·

296

source. In addition, in the high-ClOx regime, ClO· reacts with CH3 O2 and HO2 resulting

297

in Cl and increasing OH radical chain length. The impact of Cl2 emissions should not just

298

be evaluated on the day of emission, as it has a longer term impact through the loss of O3

299

and NOx. This is especially important to keep in mind for atmospheric measurements. We

300

identified the main reaction responsible for the ozone and associated OH loss, which is ClO·

301

+ NO2 → ClONO2 , followed by hydrolysis of ClONO2 . Without ClONO2 hydrolysis, ozone

302

loss is strongly reduced and methane lifetime does not increase. However, the hydrolysis rate

303

in the troposphere is variable, due to changing particle surface area density and uncertainty

304

regarding the hydrolysis rate itself, as few studies exist. More research is needed to reduce

305

these uncertainties.

306

Ship plume emissions dilute quickly, making ISA particles from ship emissions spend

307

most of their lifetime in the range of low-Cl2 emissions and local background levels of NOx.

308

This implies that the impact of ISA from shipping strongly depends on the NOx and O3

309

concentrations in the area the ship plume is dispersed into. We show that due to this effect,

310

for most of the world, ship based ISA emissions can lead to an increase of methane. Iron

311

emissions from ships are likely to increase methane lifetime, while removing ozone and NOx

312

pollution.

313

These findings are important to the discussion of how much chlorine would be required

314

to reduce methane and restore it to preindustrial concentrations. 28 It is also important as

315

chlorine sources do not release chlorine equally in terms of surface flux or volumetric rate, as

316

assumed e.g. by Li et al.. The proposed methods of introducing iron to the atmosphere are

317

point sources, 14,15,28 resulting in a high-ClOx regime that cannot be captured with global

318

models due to dilution to grid dimensions. 49 However, we have shown that the impact of Cl2

319

emissions needs to be evaluated over multiple days. Because of the long term effects on O3

320

and NOx loss the impact cannot be captured easily with a local box model as dilution will

321

depend on meteorology. Therefore, both local plume modeling and global modeling need to

322

be combined to fully appreciate the effects of Cl2 from iron emissions by ships.
