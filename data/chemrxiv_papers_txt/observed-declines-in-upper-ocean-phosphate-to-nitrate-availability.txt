Abstract:
Climate warming is increasing ocean stratification, which in turn should decrease the flux of
nutrients to the upper ocean. This may slow marine primary productivity, causing cascading
effects throughout food webs. However, observing changes in nutrient concentrations at the
ocean surface is challenging because they are often below detection limits. The nutricline depth,

15

where nutrient concentrations reach well-detected levels, is related with productivity and
indicates upper ocean nutrient availability. Here, we quantified nutricline depths from a global
database of observed vertical nitrate and phosphate profiles (1972 - 2022) to assess
contemporary trends in global nutrient availability. We found strong evidence that the Pnutricline (phosphacline) is mostly deepening, especially throughout the southern hemisphere,

20

but the N-nutricline (nitracline) remains mostly stable. Earth System Model simulations support
the hypothesis that reduced iron stress and increased nitrogen fixation buffer the nitracline, but

not phosphacline, against increasing stratification. These contemporary trends are expected to
continue in the coming decades, leading to increasing phosphorus but not nitrogen stress for
marine phytoplankton, with important ramifications for ocean biogeochemistry and food web
dynamics.

Main Text:
Nitrate and phosphate are key nutrients for ocean ecosystems (1), and Earth System Models
(ESMs) predict that increasing ocean stratification due to climate warming is decreasing upper
ocean nutrient supply (2 - 4). This trend can substantially reduce phytoplankton productivity, and
10

in turn negatively impact marine food webs (5). Consistent with these predictions, climate-induced
declines of the nutrient supply coincide with reduced productivity throughout the geological record
(6, 7). Despite these predictions, the expected decline in present-day surface nutrient availability
has yet to be detected.

15

A major challenge with observing contemporary changes in nitrate and phosphate is that they are
often below detection limits throughout the ocean surface (8, 9). However, both nutrients increase
with depth (10). The nutricline depth, where either nutrient first reaches a well-detected
concentration, commonly occurs below the surface where light limits photosynthesis and
remineralized nutrients accumulate (11, 12). This depth is widely recognized as a proxy for

20

nutrient availability due to its relationships with phytoplankton productivity (13), resource demand
(14), and community composition (15). Additionally, the nutricline depth is intimately linked with
stratification, as a more stratified ocean typically exhibits weaker vertical mixing and reduced
nutrient flux rates (16). Therefore, nutricline depths may proxy upper ocean nutrient availability

at a global scale, and we hypothesize that ongoing stratification has deepened nutricline depths
worldwide in recent decades.

We quantified nutricline depths from 1972 to 2022 throughout the global ocean and evaluated their
5

accuracy as a proxy for global nutrient limitation. Our core analysis included 31,715 nitrate and
37,549 phosphate depth profiles measured using standardized analytical techniques by the Global
Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP). Nutricline depths for nitrate
(nitracline, ZNO3) and phosphate (phosphacline, ZPO4) were defined from threshold concentrations
in Redfield proportions ([NO3-] = 3 µmol kg-1 & [PO43-] = 3/16 µmol kg-1) (17). Spatially, mean

10

nitracline and phosphacline depths are deepest in areas with the lowest surface concentrations, and
when high nutrient stress was detected by bioassay experiments and genetic biomarkers (18, 19)
(Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). Deep nutriclines are predominantly found at low and middle latitudes (Fig.
1A,B), in agreement with the notion that oligotrophic waters are mostly within tropical and
subtropical regions (20). The phosphacline is only deeper than the nitracline in the North Atlantic

15

subtropical gyre and Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 1C), which are known P-stressed regions (21 - 23).
There is also an east-west phosphacline vs. nitracline gradient in the North Pacific Ocean matching
changes in sparse surface phosphate concentrations measured with high sensitivity techniques (9).
The nitracline is much deeper than the phosphacline in each of the southern subtropical gyres (Fig.
1C). We found that nutricline depths from two larger, but more heterogeneous data sets (Global

20

Ocean Data Analysis Project [GLODAP] and World Ocean Database [WOD]), have nearly
identical spatial distributions to the depths obtained using data from GO-SHIP (Fig. S2). In
summary, these spatial patterns suggest that nutricline depths can serve as an effective proxy for
the large-scale distribution of nutrient availability and stress throughout the upper ocean.

Nutricline trends revealed declining phosphate-to-nitrate availability
To test our hypothesis of a deepening nutricline, we estimated the temporal trends for the annually
averaged nitracline and phosphacline depths using two separate linear regressions (Fig. S3). The
5

nitracline regression shows no significant change over time (p = 0.07). However, the phosphacline
significantly deepened (p = 9 x 10-7) by 23 m over the past 5 decades (TPO4 slope = 0.47 m yr-1 ,
slope SE = 0.10 m yr-1) (Fig. S3A,B and Table S1). To put this rate into perspective, the average
phosphacline depth in southern oligotrophic waters (45°S to 1°S) is only 62 m, and the average
difference between the nitracline and phosphacline depths (ZNO3 – ZPO4) is only 31 m throughout

10

the global oligotrophic ocean (45°S to 45°N) (Table S2). To account for seasonality in sampling,
we corrected observed nutricline depths by subtracting their respective monthly climatological
value. Again, only the phosphacline exhibits a deepening trend, whereas the nitracline displays no
temporal trend (Fig. S3C-E). However, using different global data sets or threshold concentrations
does sometimes indicate nitracline deepening, although this deepening rate never exceeds the rate

15

for phosphacline depths (Table S1). Also, nitracline and phosphacline slopes were not significantly
different for the lowest threshold concentrations, likely due to poorly resolved phosphacline depths
at these low concentrations. Nonetheless, these global regressions consistently show that the
phosphacline is deepening faster than the nitracline.

20

We next quantified site-specific trends for the nitracline (TNO3) and phosphacline (TPO4) depths
(Fig. 2 and Table S3). This was done to eliminate the possibility that the spatiotemporal variability
in sampling induced a spurious trend by over-representing locations with particularly deep
nutriclines at later years. The median TNO3 was negative (-0.11 m yr-1, CI95% = [-0.22, -0.02])
indicating a possible shoaling. In contrast, the median TPO4 shows a greater inclination for

phosphacline deepening (0.35 m yr-1, CI95% = [0.20, 0.49]). Similar with the global regression, this
suggests a general deepening of the phosphacline at a rate of 18 m over the past 50 years. Thus,
the site-specific trends show that only the phosphacline is deepening, whereas the nitracline is
stable or could even be shoaling.

We also observed extensive variability among site-specific trends (Fig. 2A), including both
deepening and shoaling nutriclines across smaller ocean regions. Multiple mechanisms, including
seasonality, likely contribute to the observed variation among sites. However, we will next show
that none of the tested mechanisms can account for the long-term deepening in the phosphacline,
5

but not nitracline. Simulating the actual sampling dates onto a fixed monthly climatology (WOA18
with no long-term change) resulted in interquartile ranges of TNO3 and TPO4 that are about 50% of
the observed variances. This suggests that monthly variability in nutrient concentrations is an
important source of variation in site-specific trends (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4C,D). Next, we constructed
10,000 random populations of the fixed monthly climatology to robustly quantify the effect of

10

seasonal variance without any long-term changes (Fig. S4E,F). The median trends in nutricline
depths are indistinguishable from zero, showing that monthly variability does not lead to an overall
bias in median trends. We then introduced an artificial fixed long-term trend at all sites in the
random populations. This resulted in the same variance with different locations showing a mix of
deepening or shoaling trends in agreement to what we found in the actual observations. However,

15

the median shifted to match the fixed imposed trend (Fig. S4G,H). We interpret these analyses as
the observed median capturing the actual underlying tendency in trends, whereas the variance in
site-specific trends is mostly attributed to seasonality. To match both the observed median trends
and overall variance in depths, each nitracline trend had to be sampled from a normal distribution
with a shoaling tendency (mean = -0.63 m yr-1, SD = 1.5 m yr-1), and each phosphacline trend

20

came from one with a deepening tendency (mean = 0.20 m yr-1, SD = 1.0 m yr-1) (Fig. S4I,J). This
demonstrates that the median trend robustly captures the underlying tendency of the site-specific
trends despite their high variability. In summary, these analyses show that sampling timing
contributes to the observed variability in trends between sites, but any overall shift in the median
must come from a long-term change in nutricline depths.

Outside of seasonality, variability in the site-specific trends could also arise from measurement
error or interannual climate forcings. When we simulated measurement uncertainty to the observed
nutrient concentrations, we found that the interquartile range of TNO3 only increased about 5%
5

(Fig. 2A). In contrast, the interquartile range of TPO4 increased about 40% due to the low threshold
concentration (Fig. 2A). This suggests that measurement error is a considerable factor for the
variability of TPO4 but not TNO3, despite both having nearly equal total variance. However,
accounting for sampling error to nutrient concentrations still yielded a median TNO3 indicative of
shoaling, and a median TPO4 indicative of deepening (median TNO3 = -0.18 m yr-1, CI95% = [-0.27,

10

-0.03]; median TPO4 = 0.26 m yr-1, CI95% = [0.09, 0.43]). Part of the total variance could also be
attributed to ENSO or other climate modes, which can affect upper ocean nutrient profiles on
interannual timescales (24). We found that during some El Niño years, the global median nitracline
and phosphacline depths were relatively deeper (Fig. S5). Thus, the combination of seasonal and
interannual changes in nutrient concentrations together with measurement uncertainty explain

15

most of the observed variance in nutricline trends.

Despite a large variability, the median values of TNO3 and TPO4 are both significantly different from
zero and from each other. To confirm this, we scrambled the sampling time to construct 10,000
randomized conglomerate data sets and found the median trends for each of these random
20

populations (MToRP). This showed that the probabilities of the observed medians in TNO3 and
TPO4 being zero are less than 2 x 10-2 and 1 x 10-5 respectively when compared to 10,000
randomized data sets (Table S3). Moreover, sign and Kruskal-Wallis tests also supported that both
median trends are significantly different from zero and each other (Table S3). Thus, there is some
support for a shoaling of the nitracline, and strong support for a deepening of the phosphacline.

The median trends are also consistent across different observational products and choice of
threshold concentrations (Fig. 2B and Table S3). WOD hosts nearly an order of magnitude more
nutrient observations than GO-SHIP, but these observations were collected with a diversity of
5

protocols. Nonetheless, WOD similarly shows overall shoaling and deepening trends of the
nitracline and phosphacline, respectively (Table S3). The GLODAPv2.2022 adjusted product also
shows that any measurement bias with time has little influence on the median trends (Table S3).
Additionally, we defined nutricline depths using different threshold concentrations and found
similar medians for site-specific trends through time (Table S3). Therefore, the median trends

10

across different databases and definitions agree that phosphacline depths are mostly deepening,
whereas nitracline depths are mostly shoaling (Fig. 2B and Table S3).

We finally explored the robustness of the median trends with a variety of additional tests. First, we
found a negative median trend for the paired residual ZNO3 - ZPO4, which also suggests a faster
15

deepening of the phosphacline relative to the nitracline (Fig. S6). Second, there was no indication
of a bias due to changing measurement methods during the observation period. After subtracting
mean climatological concentrations, we saw no negative trend at depths well below the nutricline
where concentrations presumably should be stable (Fig. S7). Third, the water density at the depth
of the nitracline and phosphacline show decreasing and increasing trends respectively (median

20

TNO3 = -5 x 10-3 kg m-3 yr-1, CI95% = [-7 x 10-3, -4 x 10-3]; median TPO4 = 3 x 10-3 kg m-3 yr-1, CI95%
= [8 x 10-4, 5 x 10-3]; Fig. 2B). This indicates that the nutricline depths are shifting independently
of density layers, suggesting that biological processes may control the nutricline depth trends.

Based on the combination of these tests and analyses, we conclude that there is strong support for
a general deepening of the phosphacline. It is less certain if the nitracline is stable or possibly
shoaling, but it is clearly not deepening as fast as the phosphacline. Thus, our analysis points to
differential shifts in nutricline depths for these two nutrients, revealing a contemporary depletion
5

of upper ocean phosphate relative to nitrate.

A hemispherical difference in nutricline trends
A regional analysis revealed a significant hemispheric difference in the observed nutricline trends
(Fig. 2C and Table S4). Neither nutricline depths show any significant trends in the northern
10

hemisphere. If we split the northern hemisphere into basins, the median TNO3 is significantly
negative (shoaling) in the North Atlantic, whereas the median TPO4 is marginally positive
(deepening) in the North Pacific. Across the southern hemisphere, the median trends are indicative
of phosphacline deepening and nitracline shoaling, although the medians are not significant for the
Indian Ocean (Fig. 2C and Table S4). In general, the observed nitracline shoaling and phosphacline

15

deepening are much stronger in southern (median TNO3 = -0.27 m yr-1, CI95% = [-0.40, -0.09];
median TPO4 = 0.60 m yr-1 , CI95% = [0.41, 0.71]) compared to northern basins (median TNO3 = -0.02
m yr-1, CI95% = [-0.16, 0.13]; median TPO4 = 0.13 m yr-1, CI95% = [-0.03, 0.35]) (Table S4). Thus,
the decline in phosphate-to-nitrate availability is most pronounced in the southern hemisphere.

20

Possible biogeochemical mechanisms for the observed trends
There are multiple possible biogeochemical drivers for shifting nutricline depths, including
changes in phytoplankton resource demands, external nutrient inputs (riverine or atmospheric), or
biological nitrogen fixation. First, it is commonly proposed that phytoplankton have an increasing
N:P demand in a warming ocean due to a reduction of P-rich ribosomes needed for protein

synthesis (25). We find that this biochemical mechanism is unlikely to explain our results as it
implies a faster deepening of the nitracline relative to the phosphacline. Second, changes in riverine
inputs (26) and atmospheric deposition (27) of predominantly nitrogenous material can increase
the demand for phosphorus relative to nitrogen. This mechanism is also unlikely to explain our
5

results, as increasing nitrogenous input is primarily occurring in the northern hemisphere (26, 27),
whereas a deepening phosphacline is mostly observed in the southern hemisphere (Fig. 2C and
Table S4). Hence, neither changes in phytoplankton demands nor external inputs can explain the
observed nutricline trends.

10

A third possibility is that changes in biological nitrogen fixation compensate for a declining supply
of nitrate from stratification, but not for phosphate (22). Marine nitrogen fixation is often limited
by iron (28 – 30), and for many reasons, this iron stress may be decreasing (31). Jiang et al. (2018)
found that Trichodesmium cells use iron more efficiently at elevated temperature (32). Moreover,
increasing stratification results in an increase in the Fe:N supply ratio by moderating the relative

15

importance of vertical vs. aeolian nutrient supply (33). Deposition of soluble iron from combustion
sources, including wildfire and fossil fuel burning, has been increasing in recent decades (34), and
significantly impacting marine biogeochemistry (35). Considering these findings, diazotrophs are
more commonly limited by iron in the southern and phosphorus in the northern hemisphere
(36). Decreasing iron stress would therefore mostly stimulate nitrogen fixation and phosphate

20

drawdown in the southern hemisphere. Hence, we hypothesize that the regulation of nitrogen
fixation is important for the observed decline in phosphate-to-nitrate availability and can explain
the hemispherical difference in depth trends.

Nutricline trends relate with ocean nitrogen fixation and stratification in CMIP6
To test this hypothesis, we compared trends in nitracline and phosphacline depths in the CMIP6
Earth System Models across historical and future emission scenarios (i.e., less and more stratified
scenarios, respectively) (Fig. 3A-C). In the historical scenario, all models predicted nutricline
5

trends notably smaller than the observed trends. In some models, equivalent trends for the
nitracline and phosphacline depths at Redfield proportions (i.e., TPO4 = TNO3) were seen. For other
models, the phosphacline showed a faster deepening trend compared to the nitracline, whereas the
opposite was never seen. These findings generally held true under future emission scenarios,
although most models predicted faster deepening of both nitracline and phosphacline depths in the

10

future. In conclusion, greater stratification generally led to a faster nutricline deepening in CMIP6,
but some models included biogeochemical processes causing a faster deepening of the
phosphacline relative to the nitracline.

The faster deepening of the phosphacline relative to the nitracline was correlated with ocean
nitrogen fixation rates across Earth System Models (Fig. 3D-F). A differential deepening (i.e.,
residual TPO4) was quantified as the orthogonal distance from the TPO4 = TNO3 line. Across all three
model scenarios, we found significant positive relationships between ocean nitrogen fixation rates
5

and the residual TPO4 (Table S5). The correlation coefficients and regression slopes also increased
with stronger emissions. This shows that the relationship between nitrogen fixation and declining
phosphate-to-nitrate availability is dependent on the rate ocean warming and increasing
stratification. Therefore, the CMIP6 model dynamics were consistent with the hypothesis that
nitrogen fixation with stratification determines the faster deepening of the phosphacline relative to

10

the nitracline.

Nutricline depths are influenced by nutrient uptake rates and iron deposition in CESM2
Among the CMIP6 models, CESM2 had the highest ocean nitrogen fixation rates as well as the
highest residual TPO4. Although higher than most, this model was consistent with the convergent
15

estimate of ocean nitrogen fixation quantified by Wang et al. (2019) (36). Finally, CESM2 showed
nutricline trends that were the most consistent with observations. Hence, we next investigated
different processes in CESM2 that may affect nitracline and phosphacline trends.

Flexible phytoplankton biomass composition may slow the deepening of the phosphacline relative
20

to the nitracline. With a CESM2 model, Kwon et al. (2022) found that flexible rather than Redfield
phosphate requirement led to reduced upper ocean phosphate demand by 2100 (37). We analyzed
these same experiments and found that flexible phosphate uptake also led to shallower
phosphacline depths (Fig. S8) (37). However, flexible phosphate uptake did not have a major effect

on nutricline trends through time (Fig. S8). Therefore, flexible nutrient uptake stoichiometry
impacted the initial depths of nutriclines, but was not a factor for the long-term trends.

Decreasing iron stress may enhance the deepening of the phosphacline relative to the nitracline
5

through stimulation of nitrogen fixation. (33, 34). In CESM2, we adjusted iron stress by increasing
atmospheric iron deposition (DFe) rates either by hemisphere or globally (Fig. 4). Increased
deposition rates increased nitrogen fixation and resulted in a faster deepening of the phosphacline
relative to the nitracline (Fig. 4A,B). We again found a significant relationship between the
residual TPO4 and integrated nitrogen fixation (slope = 7 x 10-4 m x [Tg Nfix]-1, slope SE = 2 x 10-4

10

m x [Tg Nfix]-1, p = 3 x 10-3, n = 10). Additionally, we determined nutricline trends in regions with
different primary nutrient limitations (Fig. 4C,D). Increased DFe led to a faster deepening of the
phosphacline relative to the nitracline no matter the location, but the strongest effect was in ironlimited regions. This suggested that as iron stress was alleviated, it was eventually replaced with
increased phosphorus stress. Thus, an increase in nitrogen fixation by alleviating iron stress

15

directly results in a faster deepening of the phosphacline relative to the nitracline.

Caveats and conclusions
We presented evidence for a deepening of the phosphacline that is decoupled from any
commensurate change in the nitracline. However, there are caveats to be considered. First, we
restricted our global trend analysis to nutricline depths that were deeper than 50 m and from 45°S
- 45°N. Omitting depths shallower than 50 m did not appreciably affect the observed trends, as

15

they remained consistent when including depths deeper than 25 m (Tables S1 and S3). The applied

latitudinal range removed the Arctic Ocean from our analyses, despite this region experiencing
some degree of nitrogen limitation (38). However, the sampling density in the Arctic was too low
to quantify trends from nutricline depths that met our criteria. Furthermore, the Arctic experiences
high variability in sea-ice cover, which is a major driver of stratification absent from the rest of
5

the oligotrophic ocean (39). Second, there were notably less cruise observations from the earliest
and latest years, but we still found a significantly faster deepening of the phosphacline from 1982
- 2012 (Tables S1 and S3). Third, ocean basins were sampled at different frequencies leading to
less statistical power for some basins, most notably for the Indian Ocean. However, the nitrate and
phosphate depth profiles were mostly sampled concurrently throughout time and space; thus, the

10

sampling variability is not expected to have any effect on the differences in the trends observed
for the two nutrients (Fig. S9). Fourth, although the global trends were robust, we recognize that
variability in the phosphacline trends were more influenced by measurement error than the
nitracline trends. Accounting for these caveats, we still find significant evidence for declining
phosphate-to-nitrate availability over the past 5 decades (1972 - 2022).

15

The cruise observations suggest that phosphacline depths deepened by approximately 20 m over
the past 5 decades, a rate that is almost an order of magnitude larger than most CMIP6 predictions
for the historical period (Fig. 2-3, Tables S1 and S3). At the observed rate, nutrient availability
throughout the southern oligotrophic gyres may soon resemble the western side of the North
20

Pacific subtropical gyre (Fig. 1C and Table S2). This transition is possible due to the predicted
decrease in iron stress for nitrogen fixation in this region (33, 34, 40). In turn, nutrient availability
at the western side of the North Pacific subtropical gyre may soon resemble the North Atlantic
subtropical gyre with widespread phosphorus stress (Fig. 1C and Table S2). A trend towards more
phosphorus stress possibly driven by nitrogen fixation has already been observed in this area (41,

42). Therefore, the current patterns and trends in nutricline depths provide a basis for predicting
which regions will begin to show increasing phosphorus stress for marine productivity.

Increasing phosphorus stress applies a selective pressure on marine phytoplankton, but some
5

implications for ecosystems and elemental cycles remain uncertain. For instance, there is
conflicting evidence whether total productivity should decline solely due to phosphorus limitation.
Although phosphate has been suggested to be the ultimate control on phytoplankton production
(1), variability in phytoplankton C:P and nitrogen fixation may buffer productivity despite
increasing stratification (37, 43). In contrast, increasing nitrogen stress might have greater impacts

10

on marine productivity, as phytoplankton have less ability to acclimate by modifying their C:N
ratio (44). Nonetheless, phosphorus limitation does select for higher C:P in phytoplankton (45,
46), consequently reducing food quality throughout many marine food webs (47). These potential
changes for marine ecosystems underscore the importance of constraining the rate of rising
phosphorus stress throughout the ocean.

15

Increasing stratification and atmospheric iron inputs will likely continue in the coming decades (3,
31), but the decline in phosphate-to-nitrate availability is still subject to change. A declining
phosphate supply would eventually start to limit nitrogen fixation rather than iron (48).
Furthermore, continued deoxygenation from warming also increases denitrification, leading to
20

greater declines in nitrate supplies (49). Therefore, the global trend toward phosphorus limitation
could be temporary, but with an unknown duration. Continued efforts to monitor multiple nutrients
and improve their model predictions should increase understanding of upper ocean
biogeochemistry as the ocean continues to warm and stratify.

Materials and Methods
Conglomerate cruise data sets
We quantified nutricline depths from 1,060 cruise data sets provided by the CLIVAR and Carbon
Hydrographic Data Office (50). Each cruise data set was formatted in a standardized netCDF4
format following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions version 1.8. These data sets included
hydrographic data measured mostly as part of the Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic
Investigations Program (GO-SHIP). Other precursor programs of repeat hydrography, such as the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), were included as well. We refer to the
conglomerate data set from CCHDO as the GO-SHIP data set throughout the main manuscript.

We also compared our results from GO-SHIP with results from two other conglomerate data sets.
We defined nutricline depths from 1,086 cruise data sets provided by the Global Ocean Data
Analysis Project merged and adjusted data product (GLODAPv2.2022) (51, 52). Nutrient
concentrations in GLODAPv2.2022 were adjusted to account for measurement biases with time
(51, 52). Therefore, GLODAPv2.2022 may have revealed potential measurement biases in the GOSHIP data set. We also referred to nutrient concentrations found in the World Ocean Database
(WOD) (53). Although WOD did not prioritize repeat hydrography, this database held 12,707
unique cruise data sets from 1972 to 2022. Despite having the least amount of cruise data sets, we
chose to focus our analysis on the GO-SHIP data set since its purpose is to provide qualitycontrolled measurements of repeat hydrography.

Cruise sampling methods
On the GO-SHIP cruises, temperature and salinity were recorded at various depths and stations
using a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) instrument (54). Nutrients were sampled from
seawater collected by a Niskin bottle rosette fitted onto the CTD (55). Nutrient concentrations
were photometrically determined from the collected seawater via continuous flow analysis. Nitrate
was determined by first reducing nitrate to nitrite in a copperized cadmium column. A
sulfanilamide solution and N-Napthylethylene-diamine were introduced to produce a red azo dye
(55, 56). To determine phosphate, molybdic acid was introduced to form phosphomolybdic acid.
The phosphomolybdic acid was reduced to phosphomolybdous acid with hydrazine to produce a
blue solution (55, 56).

Nutrient concentrations
Here, we analyzed each CTD cast where nitrate or phosphate was measured. Nitrate profiles
inclusive of nitrite concentrations (i.e., nitrate + nitrite) were excluded from our analysis, as were
any negative or outlier concentrations. We defined outlier concentrations as instances where a
nutrient decreased with depth by more than 10 µmol kg-1 in the upper ocean. Nutrient
concentrations were predominantly in units of μmol kg-1, but for concentrations expressed as μmol
L-1, we converted them to μmol kg-1 by calculating seawater density. We calculated density using
a UNESCO formula by incorporating temperature (℃) and salinity (psu) measurements included
in each bottle file (57).

Interpolating nutrients with pressure
For every cast with nutrient measurements at 2 or more pressures, we linearly interpolated nitrate
and phosphate concentrations for every 1 dbar down to a maximum pressure of 1000 dbar. The
interpolation only spanned between the lowest and highest pressures with nutrient
measurements. Similarly, we interpolated temperature and salinity from the respective cruise CTD
file for every 1 dbar. We then recorded the nutricline as the pressure and density where the
interpolated nutrient concentrations first reached threshold concentrations. The nutricline pressure
was converted to depth (m) using a UNESCO formula revised by Leroy & Parthiot (1998) (58).

Nutricline concentration thresholds
Our analysis focused on nutricline depths defined by a threshold concentration of 3 μmol kg -1 for
nitrate and the Redfield (1934) proportion equivalent for phosphate (i.e., 3/16 μmol kg-1, assuming
that N:P = 16:1) (17). We chose these threshold concentrations that were higher than other studies
(13 - 15) to minimize influence from surface mixing and ensure detectability of low phosphate
concentrations (8, 9). We also quantified nutricline trends in the GO-SHIP data set using lower
([NO3-] = 1 µmol kg-1 and [PO43-] = 1/16 µmol kg-1) and higher ([NO3-] = 5 µmol kg-1 and [PO43-]
= 5/16 µmol kg-1) threshold concentrations. This determined if the chosen threshold concentrations
had a considerable effect on the nutricline trends.

Criteria for nutricline depths
We followed a series of criteria for quantifying nutricline depths and trends to improve the
accuracy of our analyses. First, we only recorded the nutricline depth of a cast if there existed
interpolated concentrations above and below said depth. Second, we binned the coordinates of

each nutricline depth to the nearest degree of latitude and longitude to quantify average nutricline
depths per unique coordinate and year. Lastly, we quantified trends only from average nutricline
depths that were deeper than 50 m and at a latitude from 45°S to 45°N. We also repeated our
analysis using a depth boundary of 25 m. We selected these boundaries to target trends in regions
where nutrients limit growth, and minimize effects from seasonal changes in stratification (59).
We address potential biases resulting from these spatial boundaries in the “Caveats and
conclusions” section.

Significance tests for nutricline trends
We tested the significance of nutricline trends using two independent methods. First, we fitted
linear regression models to average nutricline depths through time. These nutricline depths were
annual averages for each unique geographic coordinate. Two separate regressions were fitted to
nitracline and phosphaclines, and an F-test determined if each regression was significant (i.e., p <
0.05). Second, we analyzed each geographic coordinate that had average nutricline depths recorded
for two or more unique years. For each coordinate, we fitted a regression to its average nutricline
depths vs. years to quantify its site-specific trend. These site-specific trends were quantified
separately for nitraclines and phosphaclines. The sign test determined if the global median sitespecific trend was significantly different from zero. Additionally, the Kruskal-Wallis test
determined if the median trends of nitracline and phosphaclines were significantly different from
each other. We also calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI95%) for the median trends by
generating 10,000 bootstrap samples of the data set. Thus, with global regressions and site-specific
trends, we were able to test if nitracline and phosphacline depths were generally shifting in recent
decades.

Comparing trends from random populations
In addition to the significance tests, we randomized sampling time of the nutriclines to further
examine the robustness of the observed trends. We constructed 10,000 randomized conglomerate
data sets by scrambling the years of nutricline depths, where each depth was an annual-average for
a unique geographic coordinate. For each of these 10,000 random populations, we found the
median values of the site-specific trends for nutricline depths. We recorded these median trends of
random populations (MToRP) and determined the portion of MToRP with an absolute value higher
than the absolute value of the observed median trend. Quantifying this portion of the MToRP
distribution served as a two-tailed p value to test the significance of the observed median trend.

We also investigated how measurement error may have affected the nutricline trends. From an
intercomparison study of nutrient detection, nitrate and phosphate concentrations had average
standard deviations of about 400 nmol kg-1 and 50 nmol kg-1 respectively (60). We added
additional error to the GO-SHIP observations by creating two normal distributions of values. Both
distributions had means equal to zero, and standard deviations equal to twice the values from
Aoyama et al. (2007) (i.e., 800 nmol kg-1 and 100 nmol kg-1) (60). For every nutrient concentration
in the observations, we randomly sampled a value from either the first or second distribution
depending on whether the nutrient was nitrate or phosphate. We added this sampled value to the
nutrient concentration to impose additional measurement error. We then quantified nutricline
depths and trends after altering all concentrations. We then compared the median values and
variability of the site-specific trends to those from the unaltered observations.

Investigating biases with climatologies
To explore potential temporal biases in the cruise observations, we analyzed nutrient
concentrations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s World Ocean Atlas
data product version 2018 (WOA18). WOA18 is an objectively-analyzed global climatology of
nutrient concentrations per 1° of latitude and longitude for every month (61). The vertical profiles
reached down to 800 m deep with depth bin sizes ranging 5 - 50 m. For every geographic
coordinate, we interpolated nitrate and phosphate concentrations per 1 m and found the average
nutricline depths.

We investigated WOA18 to reveal if there was a notable bias in the months nutriclines were
sampled. First, we indexed each nutricline depth based on the latitude, longitude, and month of the
respective cast. We then replaced each observed nutricline depth with its respective monthly value
in WOA18. Next, we proceeded to find the annually-averaged nutricline depth for each geographic
coordinate of each year. Then, we determined the trends of nutricline depths with time. If there
were considerable seasonal biases in cruise casts, then the global medians of these trends would
deviate from zero.

We also constructed random populations from WOA18 to determine how variability in sitespecific trends affected their median values. First, we randomly selected a potential monthly
nutricline depth for each geographic coordinate with nutricline depths observed for two or more
years in the GO-SHIP collection. We then paired these to another random, potential monthly
nutricline depth to simulate a 50-year trend for each geographical coordinate. We repeated this
procedure until 10,000 random populations of the conglomerate data set were made. Second, we

performed a similar procedure where we paired one set of monthly values to another set, but here
we imposed a ubiquitous site-specific trend by changing the second set of monthly values by a rate
equivalent to the median trend from observations. These two analyses determined if the median
trend was controlled by monthly variability in sampling. Third, we imposed a variable site-specific
trend by changing each monthly value in the second set by a rate of change randomly selected
from a normal distribution of rates. We altered the mean and standard deviation of this normal
distribution until the median trend and the variance of simulated nutricline depths (i.e., IQR) both
matched the observations. This analysis determined if the median trend actually captured an
underlying tendency of the site-specific trends despite their high variability. In summary, these
analyses with WOA18 determined if variability in the site-specific trends had considerable
influence on their median values.

Improved technology may have increased the accuracy of nutrient concentrations over time. To
test this, we investigated GLODAPv2.2016, another mapped climatology of nutrient
concentrations for each 1° of latitude and longitude (51, 62). GLODAPv2.2016 provided nitrate
and phosphate concentrations down to 5,500 m with depth bins ranging from 10 - 500 m. At each
geographical coordinate, we linearly interpolated nutrient concentrations for every 1 m of depth.
We then recorded the interpolated concentrations at the depths of 100, 300, 500, 1,000, 2,000,
3,000, and 4,000 m for each coordinate. Next, we went through each cast of the GO-SHIP
observations and recorded the interpolated concentrations at these same depths. For each cast, we
found the difference of the observed concentrations and the mapped climatology at these specified
depths. We then fitted linear regressions to the differences at each coordinate. If improved

technology imposed a measurement bias, then the differences at deeper depths may show a
negative trend with time.

CMIP6 predicted nutriclines
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) is a collection of global models
that each predict biogeochemical cycles with time (63). Séférian et al. (2020) outline some key
model differences that contribute to their contrasting predictions of biogeochemistry. These
models differ in their ocean-climate interactions, organic matter cycling rates, marine plankton
communities, biological processes, nutrient ratios, and more (63).

Here, we analyzed nutrient concentrations from CMIP6 under three emission scenarios: the
historical period, middle-of-the-road (SSP2-4.5), and business-as-usual (SSP5-8.5) (Table S6) (64,
65). For the historical scenario, we confined the years to 1972 - 2014 to better match the time span
of the observations. The future emission scenarios were confined to the years 2015 - 2100. Our
primary variables of interest were marine concentrations of nitrate and phosphate (“no3” and “po4”
respectively). We also analyzed sea temperature (“thetao”) and salinity (“so”) through time to
convert the nutrient concentrations from mol m-3 to µmol kg-1, and determine trends in nutricline
densities. These variables came from consistent model variants in terms of realization,
initialization, method, physics, and forcing; the “r1i1p1f1” variant was used when available. With
these variables, we quantified nitracline and phosphacline depths with time.

Nutricline depths in CMIP6 were quantified similar to the cruise observations. For each model
grid point, we linearly interpolated nutrient concentrations for every 1 dbar of pressure up to 1000

dbar. Pressure was converted to meters of depth using a UNESCO formula revised by Leroy &
Parthiot (1998) (58). Model grid points were then rounded to the nearest degree of latitude and
longitude to quantify average nutricline depths and densities for each unique geographical
coordinate and year. We analyzed trends from each coordinate within 45°S - 45°N that had average
nutricline depths deeper than 50 m for two or more unique years. Lastly, we tested if trends in
vertically-integrated ocean nitrogen fixation rates (“intpn2”) were related to predicted nutricline
trends. Accordingly, we determined if CMIP6 was consistent with our hypothesis that nitrogen
fixation rates together with stratification drive the decline of phosphate-to-nitrate availability.

CESM2 phosphate uptake and DFe experiments
We explored two potential drivers of nutricline trends in the Community Earth System Model
version 2 (CESM2). First, we tested if flexible C:P in phytoplankton affected nutricline trends,
which essentially tested if flexible phosphate uptake rates had any effect. We analyzed two
experimental scenarios from Kwon et al. (2022), one where phytoplankton C:P is fixed at Redfield
proportions (16:1), and another where phytoplankton C:P increased with declining phosphate
concentrations as a power-law function (37). These experiments were conducted under historical
and SSP3-7.0 emission scenarios. For these experiments, we quantified nutricline depths using the
same method as the CMIP6 models, with the exception that nutrient concentrations were left in
units of mmol m-3. Therefore, the nitracline and phosphacline were defined based on 3 mmol m-3
and 3/16 mmol m-3, respectively.

The second potential driver we tested is iron deposition (DFe) in CESM2. To begin this analysis,
we initialized the simulation with JRA55-do (66) interannual temperature forcing (1958-2018, 61

10

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-fk05l ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4074-5053 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

years) for five repeated cycles (305 years in total), using a modified version of the CESM2MARBL ecosystem (67). We ran a control run after the 305-year initialization, where historical
emissions continued for another 61 years. For experimental runs, we tested how nitrogen fixation
rates and nutricline depths responded to changing DFe either increasing globally, in just the
northern hemisphere, or in just the southern hemisphere. We augmented DFe in these areas by
either 25%, 50%, or 100%. Each experimental run started immediately after the 305-year
initialization and lasted for 61 years as well. Therefore, a total of 9 experimental runs were
conducted to constrain how DFe affects nitrogen fixation rates and nutricline trends in CESM2. For
this analysis, nutrient concentrations were converted to µmol kg-1 and nutricline depths were
quantified using the same method as the CMIP6 models.

CESM2-MARBL encompasses many essential features of marine ecosystems, including major
limiting macronutrients (N, P, Si), iron cycling processes, variable nutrient assimilation ratios,
mineral ballasting, a Q10 growth parameterization, and dynamic dissolved organic matter
(DOM) cycling (67). While the standard version of MARBL has three phytoplankton types
(small phytoplankton, diazotrophs and diatoms) and one zooplankton, we used an updated
version of MARBL in this study which includes eight types of phytoplankton and four types of
zooplankton (MARBL-8P4Z) (Yu et al., in prep). For phytoplankton, the 8P4Z model includes
1) pico-sized phytoplankton (0.5-2.0 μm): Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, pico-eukaryotes
and nitrogen-fixing diazotrophs; 2) nano-sized phytoplankton: Phaeocystis (2-10 μm),
coccolithophores (5-10 μm) and generic other nanophytoplankton (2-200 μm); 3) micro-sized
phytoplankton (20-200 μm): diatoms. For zooplankton, the 8P4Z model includes small
microzooplankton (5-20 μm, ciliates, nanoflagellates), large microzooplankton (20-200 μm,

copepod nauplii, small dinoflagellates etc.), mesozooplankton (200-2000 μm, smaller copepod,
large dinoflagellates) and macrozooplankton (>2000 μm, larger copepod, krill). Besides the
modified plankton types, the 8P4Z model also has a better representation of the phytoplankton
group-specific variable stoichiometries, both for iron (35) and for the macronutrients (N, P, Si)
(68).

average values from the GO-SHIP data set for each unique geographic coordinate and year. They were defined with
threshold concentrations of [NO3-] = 3 µmol kg-1 and [PO43-] = 3/16 µmol kg-1. Linear regressions fitted to (A) ZNO3
with time (n = 7,513) and (B) ZPO4 with time (n = 6,823). We also subtracted the WOA18 monthly nutricline depths
from observations to fit linear regressions to the residual differences of (C) ZNO3 (n = 7,680) and (D) ZPO4 (n =
6,365) with time. (E) The slopes of each regression model with their respective p values. The error bars are their
standard errors.

Figure S4: World Ocean Atlas shows that the median trends capture the underlying tendency of site-specific
trends. (A,B) Observed site-specific trends of nitracline and phosphacline depths from GO-SHIP. (C,D) Sitespecific trends after substituting GO-SHIP observations with their respective monthly values in World Ocean Atlas
version 2018 (WOA18). (E,F) Simulated site-specific trends of 10,000 random populations of paired WOA18
monthly values. (G,H) Simulated site-specific trends of 10,000 random populations after imposing a ubiquitous
trend on WOA18 monthly values. The ubiquitous trend was equivalent to the observed median trend from GOSHIP. (I,J) Simulated site-specific trends of 10,000 random populations after imposing a variable site-specific trend
on WOA18 monthly values. Each site-specific trend came from a normal distribution with a mean and standard
deviation selected such that the median trend and variance in depths were the same as the GO-SHIP observations.
The dashed lines mark the median values.

Figure S6: The median trend of ZNO3 - ZPO4 was negative, suggesting ZPO4 deepened faster. ZNO3 and ZPO4 were
defined from the GO-SHIP data set with threshold concentrations of [NO3-] = 3 µmol kg-1 and [PO43-] = 3/16 µmol
kg-1 respectively. The difference was found using average values of Z NO3 and ZPO4, such that both were deeper than
50 m deep and from 45°S - 45°N. The difference was calculated for each unique geographic coordinate and year
from 1972 - 2022.

Figure S8: Flexible phytoplankton C:P in CESM2 shoaled mean phosphacline depths. We determined how
flexible phosphate uptake affected nutricline trends in a CESM2 model described by Kwon et al. (2022) (37). The
difference of mean ZNO3 with flexible C:P and mean ZNO3 with fixed (i.e., Redfield) C:P under the (A) historical and
(B) SSP3-7.0 scenarios. The difference of mean ZPO4 with flexible C:P and mean ZPO4 with fixed C:P under the (C)
historical and (D) SSP3-7.0 scenarios. ZNO3 and ZPO4 were defined with threshold concentrations of [NO 3-] = 3 µmol
m-3 and [PO43-] = 3/16 µmol m-3, respectively. The difference calculation uses mean values of nutricline depths over
the entire time period. Negative values indicate that average nutricline depths were deeper when C:P was fixed,
whereas positive values indicate they were deeper when C:P was flexible. (E) Median site-specific trends of
nitracline and phosphaclines for fixed and flexible C:P under both emission scenarios. The dashed line is where
TPO4 = TNO3.

Figure S9: ZNO3 and ZPO4 were sampled concurrently throughout the global ocean. The histograms show the
number of nitracline and phosphacline depths defined for each year. Each nutricline depth was an annual average for
a unique geographic coordinate. The nutricline depths shown here were determined from the GO-SHIP data set
using threshold concentrations of [NO3-] = 3 µmol kg-1 and [PO43-] = 3/16 µmol kg-1 respectively. The boundaries
defining each ocean region are described in Tables S2 and S4.

Each datapoint of a regression was an annually-averaged nutricline depth for a unique geographic coordinate vs. the
year. These depths were from 45°S – 45°N, deeper than 50 m depth, and from years 1972 – 2022 unless otherwise
stated in the “Data set” column. The two groups for the ANCOVA had the same sample sizes as the regression
models.

Site-specific trends were determined from annually-averaged nutricline depths that were from 45°S – 45°N, deeper
than 50 m depth, and from years 1972 – 2022 unless otherwise stated in the “Data set” column. The 95% confidence
intervals (CI95%) of the medians were calculated by generating 10,000 bootstrap samples of the site-specific trends.
The number of annually-averaged nutricline depths used to construct 10,000 random populations are the sample size
(n) in the MToRP columns. Each p value in the MToRP columns was the fraction of MToRP that had a higher
absolute value than the absolute value of the median trend from the observations. The sample size for the sign test
was the number of unique geographic coordinates. The two groups for the Kruskal-Wallis test had the same sample
sizes as the sign tests.

The [NO3-] and [PO43-] thresholds to define ZNO3 and ZPO4 were 3 μmol kg-1 and 3/16 μmol kg-1 respectively. Sitespecific trends were determined from nutricline depths deeper than 50 m depth and from years 1972 – 2022. The
95% confidence intervals (CI95%) of the medians were calculated by generating 10,000 bootstrap samples of the sitespecific trends. The number of annually-averaged nutricline depths used to construct 10,000 random populations are
the sample size (n) in the MToRP columns. Each p value in the MToRP columns was the fraction of MToRP that
had a higher absolute value than the absolute value of the median trend from the observations. The sample size for
the sign test was the number of unique geographic coordinates. The two groups for the Kruskal-Wallis test had the
same sample sizes as the sign tests.
