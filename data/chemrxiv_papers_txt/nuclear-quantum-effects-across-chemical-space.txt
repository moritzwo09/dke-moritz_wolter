Abstract
Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are important in many physical and chemical
processes–particularly those involving lighter nuclei or occurring at low temperatures. Nevertheless, NQEs have been carefully quantified in few systems, such as
water, and their importance is rarely considered. Here, using path-integral molecular dynamics, we critically examine NQEs for a range of molecular properties (e.g.,
density, thermal expansion coefficients, isothermal compressibility, static dielectric
constant, and the heat of vaporization) across 87 molecular liquids. We discover
substantial NQEs in this broad chemical space, with molar volumes exhibiting differences of up to 5% between classical and quantum treatments; similar magnitudes
are revealed in equilibrium isotope effects from deuteration. Using machine learning, we identify that four molecular properties that are readily known or easily
computed with classical simulations—density, molar mass, hydrogen density, and
thermal expansion coefficient—are strong predictors of NQEs. Further data-driven
analysis reveals how molecular factors, such as branching and heteroatom composition, influence intermolecular interactions and fluid stability and thereby affect
observed NQEs. This work offers new insights into the relationship between NQEs
and molecular chemistry and refines expectations for when rigorous treatment of
NQEs is necessary.

Introduction
The quantum nature of nuclei influences every material and chemical process. Resulting
nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can arise as zero-point energy, (1) quantum tunneling, (2)
and quantization of proton energy levels. NQEs are generally expected to be substantial

under certain conditions, such as processes occurring at low temperature or involving
light nuclei. They have been found to be consequential in genetic stability of DNA, (3, 4)
zeolite catalysts, (5, 6, 7, 8) superconductor materials, (9, 10) and enzymatic reactions,
(11,12,13,14) amongst many other biological, chemical, and physical processes. NQEs also
directly impact experimental studies that investigate or depend on isotope substitution
(15,16,17,18,19,20,21). Therefore, NQEs are important for a wide range of processes and
conditions, yet their extent and significance is not well characterized for many systems.
Nuclear quantum effects are often deduced through equilibrium or kinetic isotope effects. In classical mechanics, kinetic isotope effects are expected but depend solely on
the mass differences between isotopes; deviations from such results highlight quantum
mechanical phenomena—such as nuclear tunneling. This is common in enzymatic reactions; (12, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27) for instance, isotope substitution can alter the oxidation
rate of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase by up to 33%. (14) In a very different scenario, the
conductivity of deuterated versus normal phosphoric acid differs by orders of magnitude,
while classical expectations suggest a ratio of ca. 1.4. (28) Meanwhile, classical statistical
thermodynamics does not predict isotope-dependent changes in equilibrium properties,
yet isotope effects are widely observed. (29,30,31,32,33,34) For example, the solid-vapor
isotope fractionation ratio between deuterated and normal water reaches values as high
as 1.208. (30) Replacing H2 O with D2 O similarly impacts the structure and properties
of biopolymer solutions, (35, 36) despite D2 O being chemically equivalent to H2 O under
classical assumptions. The temperature-dependence of intramolecular isotopic equilibria
has even been used to estimate dinosaur body temperatures via isotope-ratio mass spectrometry measurements on fossilized sauropod teeth (37). The presence of such isotope
effects signal the relevance of NQEs but do not fully characterize them.
Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) enables explicit treatment of NQEs and
calculation of isotope effects. For water, PIMD has demonstrated how intramolecular
zero-point motion and intermolecular tunneling affect properties like translational diffusion and orientational relaxation rates. (38, 39) PIMD has also revealed the significance
of NQEs in DNA base pairs, acetylene:ammonia co-crystals, and electrolyte transport in
confined aqueous systems. (40, 41, 42) Unlike more conventional methods, such as density functional theory or classical molecular dynamics, which do not directly account for
NQEs, PIMD uses an isomorphism between the statistical thermodynamics of a quantum
system and a classical system in an extended phase space (43). However, the extended
phase space increases computational costs, relative to classical MD, and it requires a force
field that describes the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, which is often expensive or unavailable. Most force fields deployed in classical simulations often implicitly
account for NQEs in uncontrolled ways by fitting to experimental data. Thus, despite the
prospective utility of PIMD, the role of NQEs for many systems and conditions remains
largely unexplored.
Here, we characterize NQEs in 87 organic liquids spanning a wide chemical space.
By comparing classical and path-integral MD simulations using a quantum chemical2

based force field, we quantify NQEs on several thermodynamic properties including molar
volume (vm ), thermal expansion coefficient (αP ), isothermal compressibility (κT ), static
dielectric constant (εr (0)), and heat of vaporization (∆hvap ). Equilibrium isotope effects
on the same systems are also examined by simulating deuterated systems. We find a
meaningful influence of NQEs for every substance and highlight key chemical features
that correlate with NQEs using unsupervised and unsupervised machine learning. This
reveals competing effects between system stability and hydrogen-atom densities on NQEs,
which particularly explains trends related to hydrogen-bonding groups and molecular
branching. By combining physics-based simulation and data-driven analysis, this work
provides a deeper understanding of NQEs in common liquid organic systems and the
conditions under which explicit consideration of NQEs may be needed.

Results
Varied effects across molecules and properties
To understand how NQEs manifest across chemical space, we simulate 87 organic molecules
at ambient conditions and quantify the extent of NQEs via
λPI − λcl
(1)
λPI
where λcl and λPI are the properties calculated via classical and path-integral MD simulations. Figure 1 summarizes the results, with Figure 1A qualitatively organizing all systems
based on influence on molar volume, vm . While it is clear and expected that heavy atoms
like chlorine, bromine, and sulfur lead to smaller NQEs, other relativistic organizing principles based on molecular constitution are less evident. More quantitatively, NQEs affect
all systems and properties (Figure 1B). Accounting for NQEs markedly increases molar
volume by up to 5.5% and also increases αP and κT for a majority of the systems, with
an average effect of nearly 8%. These systematic increases signify weaker cohesive intermolecular interactions due to nuclear delocalization, consistent with prior studies on
water and other liquid organic systems. (44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51) Quantum treatment
of nuclei yields less consistent directional changes from classical results on the enthalpy
of vaporization and the static dielectric constant. For both properties, the average effect
is small and slightly negative but also comparable to the statistical error in their calculation. Overall, these results indicate that NQEs can significantly and detectably influence
certain thermodynamic properties across diverse molecular chemistries.
Building on the preceding results that directly compare quantum and classical systems,
we probe isotope effects of deuteration using
∆λ (%) = 100 ×

λPI − λPI,D
(2)
λPI,D
where λPI,D is the property for a fully-deuterated system simulated via PIMD, and deuterated systems are expected to approximate classical behavior. The quantity ∆λD→H , is
equivalent to 1 − λH/λD where λH/λD is often noted as the (experimentally accessible) equilibrium isotope effect. Trends in ∆λD→H (Figure 1C) align directionally with ∆λ (Figure 1B) but with reduced magnitudes. Beyond consistent shifts in molar volume, the
effect of deuteration is often within the range of statistical error. This change is most
notable for αP and κT , where the average effect shifts from 7.7% and 7.6% when comparing to purely classical systems to 1.0% and 3.6% when comparing to quantum mechanical
but deuterated ones. This highlights that deuteration does not fully replicate a purely
classical treatment, and a null deuteration effect does not necessarily indicate negligible
NQEs

Key molecular determinants
We next identify key molecular features that influence the strength of NQEs in liquid
systems. Given its consistent and statistically resolvable effects, our discussion focuses on
∆vm , while analyses of other properties are included in Supplemental Information, Section
S1.
Unsupervised machine learning allows us to reduce a high-dimensional molecular feature space into a two-dimensional representation that contextualizes the studied molecules
with a broader set from the ChEMBL database (54,55). Using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) algorithm (56, 57) for the
dimensionality reduction illustrates how the simulated substances span a wide chemical
space (Figure 2A). Chemical structures displaying lower ∆vm are seemingly clustered on
the two-dimensional manifold in the vicinity of high molecular weight systems such as
chloroform. In contrast, molecules with larger ∆vm are distributed across the manifold,
indicating that diverse molecular features may enhance NQEs. This is further supported
by the fact that different functional groups can be associated with population-level effects
on ∆vm ( Supplemental Information, Figure S5). For instance, molecules with amines
tend to exhibit higher ∆vm .
To gain insight into what factors might correlate with NQEs, supervised machine learning is used to model ∆vm from simple molecular descriptors. We find that a random forest
(RF) regressor using only four input features—average atomic mass mw and classically
determined substance density ρcl , hydrogen density ncl
H , and thermal expansion coefficient
αPcl —effectively predicts ∆vm (Figure 2B). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis (58), which enables the attribution of feature contributions to predictions made by
a machine learning model, reveals intuitive trends: lighter nuclei enhance ∆vm , higher
ρcl reduces it, and greater ncl
H increases it (Figure 2C). These effects reflect a general dependence on molecular composition, as systems with low mass-density or hydrogen-rich
systems would generally imply greater sensitivity to NQEs due the presence of lighter
nuclei. However, both ρcl and substancesncl
H also have some non-trivial dependence on underlying intermolecular interactions. These interactions also directly influence the thermal
expansion coefficient αPcl , which correlates positively with ∆vm . Overall, the results indicate a complex interplay between NQEs, fluid composition, and its stability that is yet
predictable through simple properties readily computed with classical simulation.

Competing effects of system stability and hydrogen density
At first glance, the trends for nH and αP appear to reflect competing effects: higher
nH suggests stronger intermolecular forces, which would typically reduce αP . To explore
this tradeoff, we leverage the dataset to create controlled comparisons by fixing either
nH or αP and examining the effect of the other on ∆vm . This is accomplished through
k -means clustering to group molecules with similar nH values and examining correlations

data are generated with k -means clustering algorithm on the respective hydrogen densities

of the groups with ∆vm (Figure 3). Within groups with similar nH , a decrease in fluid
stability (indicated by higher αP ) tends to enhance NQEs. Conversely, across groups with
comparable stability (similar αP ), an increase in nH (and thus more light nuclei) leads
to stronger NQEs. Nevertheless, the overlapping αP ranges across different nH groups
(with some weak negative correlation) suggest that both properties facilitate predicting
the magnitude of NQEs.

Trends with hydrogen bonding and branching
To elucidate how the correlation between ∆vm and nH and αP manifests on the basis of
molecular constitution, we systematically compare groups of molecules varying in hydrogen bonding (Figure 4A) and branching (Figure 4B).
In Figure 4A, comparing 1-bromobutane (i), 1-chlorobutane (ii), butane-1-thiol (iii),
and butan-1-ol (iv) highlights the positive impact of hydrogen bonding on nH and ∆vm .
Among these molecules– which share the same number of heavy atoms, the same chemical topology, and comparable αP –the hydrogen-bonding thiol and alcohol exhibit higher
nH . However, simply increasing the number of hydrogen-bonding groups does not necessarily enhance nH and ∆vm . This is revealed by comparing the group of butan-1-ol
(iv), butane-1,4-diol (v), pentane-1,5-diol (vi), and propane-1,2,3-triol (vii). Within this
group, increasing the number of hydrogen-bonding groups minimally affects hydrogen
density but increases the stability of the fluid (decreases αP ). Evaluation of different
hydrogen-bonding groups reveals similar trends (Supplemental Information, Figure S6)

where the balance of nH and αP elucidates the resulting ∆vm . For example, relative to
alcohols with similar nH , amines display larger NQEs and associated larger αP .

In Figure 4B, comparing multiple linear molecules and their branched analogues, we
observe consistent impact on NQEs. In particular, the branched molecule exhibits larger
∆vm than the linear one. Across all four pairs, branching reduces nH , but there is a
coupled increase in αP . For these molecules, the net result is stronger NQEs in the
branched molecules. We therefore suggest that NQEs, at least as manifest through ∆vm ,
are likely to be more substantial in branched molecules owing to relatively diminished
fluid stability. This observation is reminiscent of an expected trend: boiling points for
branched molecules are typically lower than linear molecules of comparable molecular
weight and composition.

Detailed physics of linear versus branched systems
The conventional rationale for the trend involving boiling temperatures is that branched
molecules have reduced surface area and less efficient packing, which weakens intermolecular forces. Intriguingly, the linear and branched molecules studied here exhibit comparable
interaction patterns with respect to the number of hydrogen bonds, their strength, and
average nearest-neighbor distances (Supplemental Information, Figure S7). This renders
the importance of hydrogen-bonding groups on trends in αP unclear.
Resolving interaction patterns as a function of distance between neighboring molecules,
however, illustrates key differences between butan-1-ol with its branched analogue, 2methylpropan-2-ol (Figure 5). The distribution of hydrogen bonds (Figure 5A) shows that
butan-1-ol forms bonds over a broad range of intermolecular distances, while methylpropan2-ol, with less conformational flexibility, forms bonds only at separations of approximately
4.6 Å. A further distinction emerges in energetics of molecular interactions within the
fluid (Figure 5B): 2-methylpropan-2-ol exhibits a pronounced minimum in interaction energy near the distance associated with hydrogen bonding, while butan-1-ol shows steadily
diminishing attractive interactions with distance. Notably, the minimum interaction energy for butan-1-ol occurs at a distance where few or no hydrogen bonds form. Additionally, butan-1-ol lacks a strong preference for relative molecular orientation, unlike
2-methylpropan-2-ol (Figure 5C). These findings suggest that the cohesive energy of 2methylpropan-2-ol relies more heavily on hydrogen bonding whereas butan-1-ol exhibits
overall stronger dispersion forces.

Discussion & Conclusions
Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are present in all physical systems, but their significance
is rarely known. In this study, we quantified the impact of NQEs on various properties
across 87 organic molecules spanning diverse chemical space. By comparing path-integral
and classical simulations, we observed that NQEs can significantly and measurably influence molar volumes, thermal expansion coefficients, and isothermal compressibilities.

illustrate calculations of the interaction distance, which is measured between the centers
of mass of two molecules, and the orientation, which is based on the angle between the
bond vectors adjoining the carbon to the oxygen on the alcohol; the renderings adjacent
to the y-axis illustrate configurations consistent with the nearest tick marks. The interaction energy is the sum of all pairwise non-bonded energy contributions. Error regions
indicate the standard error obtained from four simulations for each bin. All molecular
renderings were generated using the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software (59)
(version 1.9.4).
Effects on dielectric constants and enthalpies of vaporization lack clear trends relative to
the uncertainty of the calculations themselves. Simulations of deuterated systems reveal
similar but reduced effects, with isotope-induced changes generally within the statistical
uncertainty, except for molar volume. This suggests deuteration often underestimates the
full extent of NQEs, as a quantum treatment of deuterium still impacts properties.
We further identified physical properties that effectively correlate with the magnitude
of NQEs. This was particularly demonstrated by a random forest model with interpretable
inputs of the average mass of composite atoms and classically computed densities, hydrogen densities, and thermal expansion coefficients. We posit this as a pragmatic approach
to anticipate the relevance of NQEs and the necessity of computationally intensive path10

integral simulations. Beyond prediction, these property trends highlight key physical
factors, some intuitive and others less so, affecting NQEs. An intriguing finding from the
analysis is the competing effect between hydrogen density and fluid stability (linked to
the thermal expansion coefficient), where both factors enhance NQEs but are somewhat
inversely correlated.
By exploiting the chemical diversity of our dataset, molecular-level insights were obtained by examining sets of molecules with variations in hydrogen content, hydrogenbonding capabilities, and comparisons between linear and branched topologies. Grouping
data based on functional groups revealed that NQEs are generally more significant in
amines compared to ethers and alcohols, for example. Broadly, systems with high hydrogen density (and therefore light nuclei) but weaker interactions, leading to lower stability,
exhibit the largest NQEs. This explains a potentially unintuitive result that systems with
multiple hydrogen-bonding groups may not exhibit strong NQEs because of the enhanced
fluid stability. By contrast, molecular branching has a general tendency to both reduce
fluid stability and hydrogen density. This study advances our understanding of NQEs in
commonly used substances, guiding experimental and computational approaches and providing a framework for when explicit treatment of NQEs is necessary to capture essential
physical phenomena.

Methods
General simulation protocols
Systems were modeled with the quantum chemistry-based Topology Automated ForceField Interactions (TAFFI) framework (60) with Waldman-Hagler mixing rules. Realspace non-bonded interactions were truncated at 14 Å. Long-range electrostatics calculations used the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm; tail corrections were applied for
Lennard-Jones interactions beyond the real-space cutoff. All PIMD simulations used a
ring-polymer bead count of P =32. All simulations used a timestep of 0.5 fs. Constanttemperature conditions were achieved using a Langevin thermostat for classical simulations and the path-integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat (61) for path-integral
simulations; both utilize a friction coefficient of 1 ps-1 . Constant-pressure conditions were
achieved using a Monte Carlo barostat with an attempt frequency of 25 fs. All PIMD
simulations were employed with a ring-polymer bead count of P =32. The force field in
tandem with these settings enables accurate reproduction of liquid-phase experimental
densities (62), effective energy conservation, and sufficient convergence of physical properties (see Supplemental Information, Figure S8, S9, and S10).
Property calculations and analyses follow utilized four independent classical and pathintegral MD simulations of each molecular system. Each simulation contained the minimum number of molecules to reach 5000 atoms, initialized with random positions and
orientations within a simulation cell of L = 50 nm3 . The initial configuration was sub11

jected to energy minimization with an energy tolerance of 10 kJ/mol followed by 0.1
ns simulation in the microcanonical ensemble. The system was then equilibrated in the
canonical ensemble at 400 K for 0.2 ns and cooled to 298.15 K over 0.8 ns with a linear
temperature schedule. Subsequently, systems were equilibrated in the isothermal-isobaric
ensemble at 1 atm for 3 ns followed by a production run of 10 ns, during which thermodynamic data was collected every 1 ps system configurations were saved every 10 ps.
All simulations were performed using the GPU implementation of the OpenMM 7.7.0
software package. (63) PIMD simulations were performed on NVIDIA A100 and P100
GPUs, with mean simulation times of 46.5 and 89.3 hours, respectively, in contrast with
classical MD simulations of 1.7 hours on A100 GPUs. Total simulation time throughout
the study was 55,383 GPU hours.

Gas-Phase Simulations
Single-molecule simulations of each system were used to calculate the gas-phase energy
to obtain ∆hvap . A molecule was placed in a large box with a volume of 125 nm3 , and
simulated in the microcanonical ensemble for 1 ns, followed by the canonical ensemble at
298.15 K for 0.4 ns using an Andersen thermostat with a collision probability of 10 ps-1 .
Linear and angular momenta of each system were removed, the particle velocities were
rescaled, and the potential energies were saved every 1 ps.

isothermal-isobaric ensemble at for 0.5 ns, followed by 1.5 ns production runs where the

Hydrogen-bond densities, nH , were computed by analyzing configurations sampled
every 1 ns. Hydrogen bonds were identified using geometric criteria: a cutoff distance
of 3.6 Å between participating atoms and a cutoff angle of 150° for the alignment of the
three involved atoms. These calculations were facilitated using the MDAnalysis Python
library (64, 65) (version 2.1.0).

Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimension reduction was performed using the Python umap-learn package (version 0.5.3),
with MMFF94 atom types to describe the a 34-dimensional feature space. The MMFF94
atom types were obtained using the rdkit Python package (version 2022.9.3). (66) The
UMAP analysis includes additional small organic molecules obtained from the ChEMBL
database. Molecules containing rings, net charge, flourine atoms, or more than two double
or triple bonds were excluded, resulting in 2,879 molecules. For the UMAP hyperparameters, analysis used 100 for the size of local neighborhood, 1.0 for the minimum distance
between embedded points, and Euclidean distances. The k -means clustering algorithm
to categorize the systems into four groups based on their nH was generated using the
scikit-learn Python package (version 1.0.2) with default hyperparameters. (67)

Supervised Learning
Supervised learning via random forest regression used the scikit-learn Python package.
Model inputs included ρ, mw , nH , and αP from classical MD simulations. Model training
and assessment used a leave-one-out split. Each molecule was tested by training the model
on the other 86 molecules. This process was repeated for all 87 molecules. The reported
R2 value and its associated error were calculated from five iterations with different random
seeds. Each random forest model used 20 decision trees and required four samples per
split. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was performed using the shap

Python package (version 0.44.1) on each of the four input parameters for the random
forest regression model.
The LIBSVM implementation of C-Support Vector Classification algorithm (68,69) in
scikit-learn Python package (version 1.0.2) was used to generate support vector machine
boundary lines for four groups of molecules based on their nH . A linear kernel type and
a regularization parameter of 1.0 were chosen as the algorithm hyperparameters.

Impact of force field
We use TAFFI because it relies purely on quantum chemical calculations for its parameterization and for its computational efficiency; however, we acknowledge that the reported
magnitude of NQEs could differ based on the underlying force field. To gain some insight
into this sensitivity, classical and PIMD simulations using two different force fields–the
all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simul ations (OPLS-AA) force field and Open
Force Field (OpenFF, version 2.0.0 with unconstrained bonds)–were also performed and
analyzed for a subset of 11 molecules. Simulation procedures were the same as described
in General Simulation Protocols.
Relative to the TAFFI results, OPLS-AA and OpenFF consistently find larger ∆vm
across all systems (Supplemental Information, Figure S12). It is important to note that
OPLS-AA and OpenFF include empirical adjustments, potentially inherited from prior
developments, making them strictly unsuitable for PIMD simulations. As a result, this
analysis is merely suggestive rather than definitive regarding differences from alternative
representations of the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface. However, the results
do not indicate significant exaggeration of effect sizes from TAFFI. Future work could explore variations arising from entirely different interaction models, such as machine learning
potentials.
