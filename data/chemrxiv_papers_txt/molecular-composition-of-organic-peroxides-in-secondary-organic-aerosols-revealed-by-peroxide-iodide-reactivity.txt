Organic peroxides are health-relevant organic components in secondary organic aerosols
(SOA), which is also a major compound class substantially contributing to SOA mass.
However, their molecular identification in SOA is highly challenging and uncertain. Iodide is
known to selectively react with peroxides, and their kinetics are fundamentally determined by
the structures of individual peroxides. Here we extrapolate this knowledge and develop a novel
analytical strategy for molecular characterization of organic peroxides in α-pinene SOA via
iodometry kinetic experiments, using liquid chromatography–high resolution mass
spectrometry. Through non-targeted analysis, more than 300 organic peroxides are identified
in α-pinene SOA with unprecedented accuracy of their chemical formula. Their reactivity with
iodide is highly compound-dependent and can vary four orders of magnitude, within the range
observed for some commercial organic peroxides with known structures. In particular, more
than 65% of organic peroxides in α-pinene SOA exhibit a slow reactivity with iodide, with an
e-folding lifetime exceeding one day. The structures of 12 organic peroxides derived from
stabilized Criegee intermediates are further proposed and discussed based on different
experimental evidences. Our study improves the molecular-level identification and
understanding of organic peroxides in SOA, offering numerous opportunities for further
investigation into their formation chemistry, atmospheric transformation, and health impact.
Additionally, the peroxide-iodide reactivity is proposed as a new metric that can provide both
information on the oxidizing capability and structure of individual organic peroxide in SOA.

Atmospheric aerosol particles have great impact on air quality, climate change, and human
health.1 They are found everywhere in the Earth's atmosphere, present in varying composition
and concentrations from remote oceanic regions and pristine wilderness areas to heavily
industrialized cities. Among different aerosol components, secondary organic aerosols (SOA)
are a significant component that contributing 20-90% of the total aerosol mass.2, 3 SOA are
typically formed through cascade (photo-)oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in
the atmosphere, leading to the formation of less volatile products that condense onto existing
particles or nucleate to form new particles.4 SOA consists of thousands of different organic
compounds, ranging from simple molecules to highly oxidized and multifunctional species. It
has been postulated that organic peroxides (ROOH and ROOR, where R denotes an organic
group), a significant compound class of SOA components, may play a pivotal role in the toxicity
and related health effects of aerosols.5 This is primarily due to their reactive and oxidizing
properties, where peroxides are also considered as a compound class contributing to the socalled reactive oxygen species. Despite the significance of organic peroxides in atmospheric
chemistry and human health, the analytical identification and quantification of these
compounds in atmospheric aerosols remains highly challenging.6

Iodometry is a well-established titration method for quantifying total peroxide because iodide
is known to selectively react with peroxides.5 Potassium iodide (KI) is typically added to an
acidified SOA extract in a large excess (e.g. a few hundred times or more), which usually
allows the total peroxides to be titrated by iodide and then fully converted to I3- after several
hours before being quantified by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Based on such iodometry UV-Vis
measurements, it has been reported that organic peroxides contribute up to 80% of SOA mass,
though there is still a very large uncertainty and variation regarding the mass fraction of
organic peroxides in SOA.5 However, current molecular-level understanding of organic
peroxide is still very limited due to several reasons. Firstly, a significant number of organic
peroxides present in SOA remain poorly identified and characterized. This is mainly due to the
chemical complexity of SOA molecular composition with diverse structures, e.g. co-existence
of many peroxide and non-peroxide isomers. In particular, only about ten organic peroxide
standards are commercially available, while most of them are not atmospherically relevant, in
sharp contrast to a large speciation of organic peroxides present in SOA. Secondly, the
atmospheric formation and transformation pathways of organic peroxides are highly complex.7
On the one hand, numerous pathways exist by which organic peroxides can be formed, either
in the gas phase or particle phase, or partitioned between the two. On the other hand, organic
peroxides are reactive components, which can participate in atmospheric transformation by
oxidizing or reacting with other compounds,8 or undergo degradation due to the labile property
of the -O-O- functional group.9

Therefore, there is a need of reliable and accurate analytical method for molecular-level
identification of organic peroxide in SOA, which would allow further investigation into their
formation chemistry, chemical transformation, and health impact. Recently, Zhao et al.10
developed a novel analytical method for molecular identification of organic peroxides in SOA,
which combines iodometry and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass
spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Briefly, one aliquot of SOA extract was untreated, while another
aliquot was dosed with concentrated KI to proceed iodometry reactions for several hours,
before these two samples being injected into LC-HRMS. The organic peroxide is therefore
identified if the chromatographic peak is disappeared or largely reduced in the KI-treated
sample. Another study 11 further employed this method and 75 isomer-resolved organic
peroxides were identified in α-pinene SOA. These previous studies indeed show iodometryassisted LC-HRMS as a promising method for molecular identification of organic peroxides in
SOA. However, the kinetics between iodide and organic peroxides should be fundamentally
determined by the structure of individual peroxide, which was not yet fully recognized. An
analogous example is the hydrolysis, though this is a very different type of reaction compared
with iodometry. As explored in our recent study,12 a number of structure-known α-acyloxyalkyl
hydroperoxides (AAHPs, a sub-class of organic peroxide) were synthesized and their

hydrolysis kinetics were experimentally determined to be very compound-dependent. Given
the very large speciation and structures as well as diverse formation pathways of organic
peroxides in SOA, we hypothesize that the peroxide-iodide reactivity should also be
compound- and structure-dependent, which is the main motivation of this study.

In this study, we firstly characterized the kinetics between iodide and individual peroxide
standards that are commercially available, which allows us to recognize the range and
importance of peroxide-iodide reactivity. Then, we performed iodometry kinetic experiments
for α-pinene SOA based on iodometry-assisted LC-HRMS and non-targeted analysis, where
more than 300 organic peroxides were unambiguously identified with precise formula
information, and extended structure information was further revealed by peroxide-iodide
reactivity. Our results expand the molecular-level identification and understanding of organic
peroxides in SOA, which represents a fundamental step and prerequisite for future
investigation of their formation chemistry, atmospheric transformation, and health impact.

All the 11 commercial peroxide standards were bought from Sigma-Aldrich, including
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), peracetic acid (PAA, 36-40%), 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (3CA, 77%), benzoyl peroxide (BP, with 25% H2O), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH, 70%),
cumene hydroperoxide (CH, 80%), tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (t-BPB, 95%), tert-butyl
peracetate (t-BPA, 50%), tert-butyl peroxide (t-BP, 98%), dicumyl peroxide (DP, 98%), and 2butanone peroxide (2-BP, 32%). Additional chemicals used in this study include α-pinene
(98%, Sigma-Aldrich), potassium iodide (KI, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (ACN, Optima
LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific), methanol (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific), formic
acid (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific), acetic acid (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher
Scientific), camphorsulfonic acid (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), cyclohexane (99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
and water (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific).

Ten different α-pinene SOA samples were collected from flowtube experiments by mixing αpinene vapor (in ppm level) with O3 in the dark under various conditions. The formed SOA
particles were collected onto 47 mm PTFE membrane filters (0.2 μm pore size, Whatman)
with a known mass loading (~200 μg). Figure S1 shows the flowtube setup, which incorporates
a recently developed instrument, namely organic coating unit,13 for the precise and consistent
generation of VOC vapor prior to its mixing with ozone. These flowtube experiments were
conducted under a wide range of conditions, including variations in initial ozone concentrations
(0.5–25 ppm), humidity (0–80%), and with or without the addition of cyclohexane as an OH
scavenger. After collection, one-fourth of the filter was dosed with 20 μL of 5 μM
camphorsulfonic acid as an internal standard, and then immediately extracted by acetonitrile
(ACN). The extracts were then concentrated to complete dryness (Eppendorf Concentrator
plus, Fisher Scientific) and reconstituted with 150 μL of ACN before being injected into LCHRMS. We intentionally use ACN as extraction solvent to minimize other unwanted
decomposition processes such as hydrolysis, as good stability of AAHPs in ACN have been
observed in our recent study.12 For the later on SOA iodometry kinetic experiments (as
described in Section 2.5), ten extracts from ten different α-pinene SOA samples were
combined as one extract, which should be highly representative as it reflects many different
α-pinene SOA generating conditions on average.

The ozonolysis of alkenes generates a type of reactive intermediates, stabilized Criegee
intermediates (SCIs), which can further undergo various bimolecular reactions with water,
alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids to form different SCI-derived organic peroxides,
including α-substituted hydroperoxides and secondary ozonides (SOZ). We use an impinger

to synthesize a number of SCI-derived peroxides via liquid-phase ozonolysis. Briefly, high
concentrations of O3 (∼500 ppm, 100 mL min–1) was bubbled through a 10 mL ACN solution
containing 1 mM α-pinene. O3 reacted in solution with α-pinene resulting in the formation of
SCIs, which were rapidly scavenged by the other co-produced oxidation products and lead
the formation of SCI-derived organic peroxides. The oxidized compounds produced during the
liquid-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene include various carboxylic acids, carbonyls, etc, and some
of them are also expected to be formed in the gas-phase ozonolysis. At each time interval, 75
μL of solution was taken from the impinger for LC-HRMS injection, which allows to track the
temporal trends of individual compounds. The temporal trend of these SCI-derived organic
peroxides should follow a unique pattern that increasing in the beginning and then reaches a
plateau after ca. 5 min, a critical timing when alkenes are fully consumed and SCIs are no
longer available in our condition. Such a unique temporal pattern was firstly revealed in our
recent study for synthesizing a number of AAHPs,12 and here we extend this idea to synthesize
a number of SCI-derived peroxides. Some of these SCI-derived peroxides are expected to be
found in α-pinene SOA samples, and their structures can be further inferred based on some
known formation pathways.

LC-HRMS consists of an ultraperformance liquid chromatography unit (ACQUITY UPLC IClass, Waters) coupled with a high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS, Orbitrap Q Exactive
Plus, Thermo Scientific). The detailed parameters for liquid chromatography and mass
spectrometry are similar to that described in our recent study,12 which has been summarized
in Table S1. The mass spectrometer was calibrated daily for positive and negative modes
using Thermo Scientific Pierce Ion Calibration Solution (Fisher Scientific), while the data
presented in this study is mainly from positive mode. In addition, an HPLC Gradient System
Diagnostics Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) containing five compounds was injected daily to monitor the
stability of the signal intensity and retention time (RT). The extracted ion chromatograms (EICs)
for selected ions were exported using Xcalibur 2.2 software (Thermo Scientific) with a mass
tolerance of 10 ppm.

The first part of iodometry kinetic experiments is for those 11 peroxide standards that are
commercially available. We monitor the I3- formation temporal pattern for each peroxide
standard using a UV–Vis spectroscopy (LAMBDA 365, PerkinElmer), allowing us to determine
their peroxide-iodide reactivity individually. Specifically, these peroxide standards were
prepared and diluted in ACN solution at ~50 μM. Then, 1.8 mL peroxide standard (~50 μM in
ACN) mixed with 0.1 mL acetic acid (600 mM in ACN) in a vial, followed by the addition of 0.1
mL KI (400 mM in H2O). This triggers the iodometry reaction in a 2 mL solution containing ~45
μM peroxide standard, 30 mM acetic acid and 20 mM KI, which was regularly measured by
UV-Vis over different time scales from minutes to up to 4 weeks. The addition of acetic acid
creates an acidic condition, which provides enough protons to proceed iodometry reaction.
The solution was stored in a closed vial at room temperature (~20 ℃), and its pH cannot be
accurately determined because of the ACN-dominated solution.

The second part of iodometry kinetic experiments is for SOA samples, which were performed
in a similar way like the above peroxide standards, where they were regularly measured by
LC-HRMS instead of UV-Vis. Specifically, 40 μL was taken from each α-pinene SOA extract
(150 μL initial) and finally 10 extracts were combined as 400 μL. One aliquot (180 μL) from
the combined extract mixed with 10 μL acetic acid (600 mM in ACN) in a vial, followed by the
addition of 10 μL KI (400 mM in H2O) to trigger the iodometry reaction; another 180 μL aliquot
was treated in a same way by adding 10 μL acetic acid (600 mM in ACN) and 10 μL H2O,
instead of KI. As shown in Table S2, these two SOA samples are designated as KI-treated
and non-treated respectively, which were regularly injected into LC-HRMS for 4 weeks. Note
that we directed the LC eluting flow into waste for the 0-3 min of the whole 30 min method to
minimize possible contamination of KI entering into HRMS, as 20 mM KI present in the KI4

treated samples was quite high and might cause unexpected contamination. These KI-treated
and non-treated SOA samples was stored in an autosampler at 8 ℃ during that four weeks,
with a closed cap to avoid evaporation.

The LC-HRMS raw data files were converted to mzML format using the ProteoWizard
(MSConvert, version 3) software and were subsequently analysed by MZmine 4.2.0.14, 15 An
optimized workflow includes mass detection, chromatogram building and deconvolution, C13
isotope filtering, RT alignment, feature grouping and formula prediction. The non-targeted
analysis workflow and detailed parameters used in this study for MZmine are summarized in
a batch file as supplementary material, which allows for reproducible LC-HRMS data
processing by other MZmine users. The organic peroxide identification is based on an inhouse data processing tool with graphical user interface (GUI) to allow for efficient data filtering
and visualization, which are described in Text S1 and Fig. S2.

The rate constants for peroxides with iodide are mostly not available, and therefore we firstly
characterize the reactivity of individual peroxide standards with iodide. 11 peroxide standards
are selected, including 1 inorganic peroxide (H2O2) and 10 organic peroxides with diverse
structures, as shown in Fig. 1. These peroxides are selected due to their commercial
availability, though most of them are not atmospherically relevant. It is well known that
peroxides can oxidize iodide and finally lead the formation of I3-, which can be easily identified
by UV-Vis measurement. As mentioned in Section 2.5, we performed iodometry kinetic
experiments in bulk solutions containing ~45 μM peroxide standard, 30 mM acetic acid and
20 mM KI. We monitored the I3- absorption as a function of time, which allows for a relative
comparison of peroxide-iodide reactivity (k1st) among those peroxide standards.

Fig. 1 Summary of peroxide-iodide reactivity (k1st) for the 11 commercially available peroxides
with diverse structures. The reactivity was fitted or estimated from iodometry kinetic
experiments based on UV-Vis measurement, which are described and summarized in Text
S2, Fig. S3 and Table S3. The reactivity for [1] PAA and [2] 3-CA were estimated as lower
limit, and reactivity for [8] t-BPB, [9] t-BPA, [10] t-BP and [11] DP were estimated as upper
limit. The e-folding lifetime (τ1/e) for each peroxide was labelled.

I3- has an absorption peak that typically reported within 350-353 nm in water,16, 17 and we are
aware that the I3- absorption peak shifts a bit to 361 nm when present in ACN-dominated
solvent (i.e. 95% ACN + 5% H2O in this study), which has been described in details in Text
S2. As shown in Fig. S3, we observed large differences of I3- temporal profiles among these
peroxide standards, which suggests a large variation of I3- formation rate between individual
peroxide and iodide. For instance, PAA and 3-CA were fully titrated to I3- within less than 1 s,
while the temporal I3- formation of some peroxides (e.g. t-BPA, t-BPB, t-BP and DP) cannot
reach a plateau even after more than two weeks. Since I- is in large excess, the k1st values for
these selected peroxides with iodide can be further fitted or estimated, and the calculation
details are described in Text S2.

As summarized in Fig. 1 and Table S3, these peroxide standards are classified into several
sub-groups, with the k1st values generally following the below order: R(C=O)OOH (105 d-1) >
R(C=O)OO(C=O)R (103 – 104 d-1) > ROOH ≈ H2O2 (10-1 – 10 d-1) > R(C=O)OOR (10-2 – 10-1
d-1) > ROOR (10-3 – 10-2 d-1). Such compound- and structure-dependent reactivity of peroxide
with iodide is reasonable and can be structurally explained by the specific position of peroxide
functional group present. For example, the peroxide bond becomes more reactive when
neighbouring a hydrogen atom, rather than an organic group. In addition, the presence of C=O
bond next to the peroxide functional group also increases the reactivity of organic peroxides.

Among all these peroxide standards, peracids such as PAA and 3-CA show highest reactivity
with iodide, which is not surprising. Generally, it is known that oxidation rate of iodide by PAA
is much faster than that by H2O2, which leads to some spectrophotometric methods for the
separate quantification of PAA and H2O2 when they are co-existed.18 Despite its presence in
the atmosphere,19 PAA has also been widely applied into other fields due to its highly oxidative
ability, such as advanced oxidation technology in wastewater treatment.20 To the best of our
knowledge, the available peroxide-iodide kinetic measurements are still limited to PAA and
H2O2 with the reported aqueous rate constants differing about 4-5 orders of magnitudes (e.g.
4.22×102 M-1 s-1 for PAA 21 and 9.50×10-3 M-1 s-1 for H2O2 22 that both at similar pH = 4.3),
which qualitatively agrees with our observation. The measurement of k1st values with such a
wide range indicates an important metric, which directly links to the peroxide structures and
provide sub-structural information, as explored in the next sections.

Given the above iodometry kinetic experiments from those peroxide standards, it is reasonable
to assume that the kinetic of organic peroxides in SOA with iodide should also be very
compound-dependent. We test this idea by performing SOA iodometry kinetic experiments,
where a number of α-pinene-SOA samples were collected under different experimental
conditions (see Section 2.2) and their combined extracts were divided into two aliquots. One
aliquot was treated by adding concentrated KI and the other was not, and both were
sequentially injected into LC-HRMS over a time scale of 4 weeks (see Section 2.5). This is
regarded as an expanded method that initially proposed by Zhao et al.,10 and we name it as
time-dependent iodometry-assisted LC-HRMS.

We performed non-targeted analysis for the whole LC-HRMS dataset with an optimized
workflow using MZmine 4.2.0, followed by an in-house data processing tool with GUI to
efficiently visualize data and identify organic peroxides (see Section 2.6 and Fig. S2). The
selection criteria for organic peroxides are described in Text S1. Fig. 2 shows several
representative examples of the identified organic peroxides, including their time-dependent
EICs and KI-treated/non-treated ratios. Such type of temporal pattern would allow us to identify
individual organic peroxide unambiguously, especially when multiple adducts are found. For
example, each suggested formula is constrained by at least two adducts and one C13 isotope
pattern, and some adducts are matched to H2O neutral loss (e.g. C12H20O5 and C20H32O6 as
shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2C), which are all within a RT tolerance of 0.1 min and m/z tolerance
of 5 ppm. Note that we are aware of the common issues of in-source fragmentation from
HRMS,23, 24 which has been taken into consideration in this study. For example, some

iodometry-assisted LC-HRMS. Each organic peroxide was displayed with time-dependent
extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) from KI-treated and non-treated dataset, as well as
temporal trends of KI-treated/non-treated ratios. The exponential fit applies to the merged data
of multiple adducts from the same compound.

We use the exponential decay profile of KI-treated/non-treated ratio as a metric for k1st value
to determine the reactivity between organic peroxide and iodide, which rules out any other
non-iodometry effects such as daily variation of instrument sensitivity, sample evaporation,
etc. As shown in Fig. 2, some organic peroxides such as C12H20O5 (RT=13.57 min) and
C20H32O6 (RT=17.78 min) show fast decay with τ1/e much less than 1 day, while the relatively
slow decay profile such as C16H25O5 (RT=19.86 min) suggests τ1/e of more than 10 days. Such
individual decay profiles of KI-treated/non-treated ratio indicate a large reactivity difference
among these selected organic peroxides, and these k1st values are therefore regarded as
chemical metrics that are indeed very compound-dependent. This observation is further
reinforced by the reactivity difference found among isomers, where two isomers of C20H32O5
eluting at 20.70 and 20.97 min respectively show different decay rates, which is most likely
due to their different structures. Note that C12H20O5 (RT=13.57 min) and C20H32O6 (RT=17.78
min) are structure known AAHPs, where both of them were previously synthesized and
identified in α-pinene SOA in our recent study.12 Their successful identification in this study
suggests the reliability of the new analytical method, without relying on authentic standards.

A total number of 374 organic peroxides are identified with confidence level 4 in α-pinene SOA,
where the top 50 compounds are sorted by their intensity, together with their k1st values and
τ1/e that are summarized in Table S4. Fig. 3 shows the intensity (averaged from non-treated
dataset) of these organic peroxides identified in α-pinene SOA as a function of their decay
rates. Among these 374 organic peroxides, they are categorized into C6-C10 (n=30) as
monomers, C11-C20 (n=209) as dimers, C21-C30 (n=130) and C31-C40 (n=5) as higher order
oligomers. It clearly shows that the intensity of these organic peroxides varies about three
orders of magnitude, and their k1st values differ up to four orders of magnitudes, regardless of
monomeric, dimeric or oligomeric regimes. Interestingly, the error bar of the intensity reflects
the variability of individual peroxide in non-treated dataset (see Table S2 for detailed
constitution), which overall correlates with peroxide-iodide reactivity. For instance, these
organic peroxides failing into “very slow” category tend to be less variable from the intensity.
As shown in the pie chart of Fig. 3, more than 65% organic peroxides have a k1st value less
than 1 d-1 (equivalent to τ1/e longer than 1 day), which further contributing more than 75% of
total peroxide intensity.

peroxides are divided by their peroxide-iodide reactivity ranges as shown in the pie charts. A
lower limit k1st value of 48 d-1 (τ1/e ~0.5h) was applied for some super fast-reactive peroxides,
as their intensity decay to zero at the first measurement of 3 h after treating with KI and
exponential fitting was therefore not possible.

The molecular composition and identification ability of organic peroxide in SOA is therefore
expanded based on their wide range of reactivity with iodide. In particular, some structures
and formation chemistry of organic peroxides can be qualitatively inferred based on this k1st
metric. For example, there are some known pathways leading to ROOH formation that likely
being grouped into “fast” and “very fast” category, such as SCI-derived α-substituted
hydroperoxides (e.g. AAHP), reactions between RO2 and HO2, and especially some
autooxidation processing leading to ROOH with multiple -OOH functional group.26 On the
other hand, some known processes such as biomolecular reactions between RO2 and RO2,
SCI and carbonyls (e.g. SOZ) can lead to ROOR formation, which are likely being grouped
into “slow” and “very slow” category. Therefore, peroxide-iodide reactivity provides key
information that holds great promise to further differentiate numerous formation pathways
leading to organic peroxide formation.

The above results point to the fact that peroxide-iodide reactivity is strongly related to the
structure of peroxides, which may be helpful for their structure elucidation. Structure
characterization of organic peroxides in SOA can provide molecular-level understanding of
their formation chemistry. However, accurate structure assignments for all these identified
organic peroxides in SOA are not possible. Nevertheless, we may still infer some structures
based on existing knowledge of organic peroxide formation chemistry.

Previous studies suggest that SCI-involved dimeric pathway is a major channel leading to the
formation of organic peroxide. Here we demonstrate a simple method to synthesize a number
of SCI-derived organic peroxides through liquid-phase ozonolysis experiments. Specifically,
high concentrations of O3 were bubbled through a 10 mL ACN solution containing 1 mM αpinene, resulting in the formation of C10 SCIs and other oxidation products such as water,
alcohols, carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, etc. It is expected that SCIs should be rapidly
scavenged by those co-produced oxidation products and lead the formation of SCI-derived
organic peroxides, such as α-hydroxylalkyl hydroperoxides (HAHPs), α-alkoxyalkyl
hydroperoxides (AHPs), AAHPs and SOZs.5 The temporal trend of these SCI-derived organic
peroxides should follow a unique pattern that increasing in the beginning and then nearly
reaches a plateau after ca. 5 min, a critical timing when alkenes are fully consumed and SCIs
are no longer available in our condition. Such a unique temporal pattern was firstly revealed
in our recent study where AAHPs were synthesized via liquid-phase ozonolysis experiments,12
which allows us to identify SCI-derived peroxides easily. It is expected both liquid-phase and
gas-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene share many similar oxidation products, and these oxidation
products are ready to be scavenged by SCIs. Therefore, some SCI-derived peroxides
synthesized in the liquid-phase ozonolysis experiments are expected to be found in the αpinene SOA samples.

As summarized in Table 1, 12 out of 374 organic peroxides found in α-pinene SOA are
confirmed as SCI-derived peroxides, which is based on (i) their unique temporal trends in
liquid-phase ozonolysis experiments (see Fig. S4) and (ii) their identification as organic
peroxide in SOA iodometry kinetic experiments (see Fig. S5). The formula and suggested
structures of their monomer partners are also summarized in Table 1, which are derived by
subtracting the C10 SCI monomer (e.g. C10H16O3) of α-pinene. Most of these monomers have
been previously identified as oxidation products from α-pinene with reported structures, as
summarized in the literatures.27, 28 Therefore, the formation chemistry and structures of these
SCI-derived peroxides can be suggested based on known formation pathways.

As shown in Table 1, most of these SCI-derived peroxides are suggested as SOZs, and their
k1st values (max = 0.34 d-1, min = 0.042 d-1) further supports their structures as SOZs. The
most abundant SOZs are #1 and #3 (rank number sorted by intensity as shown in Table S4),
which contribute more than 10% of total peroxide intensity. Both #1 and #3 are isomers and
should have similar structures due to their close RT of 20.70 and 20.97 min, respectively. They
are suggested to be formed from the bimolecular reaction between pinonaldehyde (C10H16O2)
and C10 SCI at confidence level 2, depending on boning to C=O or -CHO of pinonaldehyde.
Pinonaldehyde is one of the most abundant oxidation products from α-pinene, with reported
molar yield (sum of gas and particle phase) of 10-19%.27 Similar to pinonaldehyde,
norpinonaldehyde (C9H14O2) and 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl-1,3-dicarboxaldehyde (C8H12O2) are
suggested as the monomer partners of #25 and #118, which are two SOZs with identification
confidence level 2. Their eluting follows the order of 19.80 min (#118) < 20.23 min (#25) <
20.70 min (#1) < 20.97 min (#3), which is also qualitatively consistent with knowledge of their
reduced polarity when increasing the molecular weight (MW).

As mentioned before, two organic peroxides (#8 and #15) are known as AAHPs, as they were
previously synthesized in our liquid-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene experiments following the
addition of cis-pinonic acid and acetic acid respectively.12 Both two AAHPs show fast reactivity
(>10 d-1) with iodide, consistent with their known structures as ROOH. Note that cis-pinonic
acid is an example that have both -COOH and C=O functional groups, but the addition of cispinonic acid during liquid-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene only leads the formation of AAHP
rather than both AAHP and SOZ.12 This suggests that -COOH group is likely more reactive
than C=O when competitively bonding with SCI, if the monomer partner has multiple functional
groups. This is also qualitatively consistent with a previous finding on kinetic study of SCI,
where the relative rate constant between C13 SCI and some reactants follows the order of
water (1) < methanol (22) < 2-propanol (50) < formaldehyde (2700) < formic acid (6700) <
heptanoic acid (17000), i.e. the values are normalized to water as shown in brackets.29 For
#52 (C19H30O6), its monomer partner should be C9H14O3 (MW=170), but there are several
MW=170 candidates from the oxidation of α-pinene such as norpinonic acid, pinalic-4-acid
and other isomers.27, 28 Norpinonic acid has both -COOH and C=O functional groups that
similar to cis-pinonic acid, which is expected to form AAHP rather than SOZ when boning to
SCI. However, #52 shows a peroxide-iodide reactivity of 0.11 d-1, suggesting that it is more
likely SOZ. It is therefore we rule out the possibility of MW=170 isomer like norpinonic acid.
We tentatively assign this monomer partner as pinalic-4-acid and thus the structure of #52 is
suggested at confidence level 3, as we cannot exclude other possible monomers of MW=170.

There are four C20H32O6 (#82, #108, #30, #22) that assigned as SOZs based on their peroxideiodide reactivity range, which are likely from two different monomers of C10H16O3 (MW=184).
There are also several possible candidates for MW184, such as cis-pinonic acid, hydroxy
pinonaldehyde, (2,2-dimethyl-3-acetyl)-cyclobutyl formate, etc.27, 28 Cis-pinonic acid is unlikely
given that only AAHP (rather than both AAHP and SOZ) was found in our recent study. 1hydroxy pinonaldehyde and 10-hydroxy pinonaldehyde are known oxidation product from
pinonaldehyde.28 We tentatively assign 10-hydroxy pinonaldehyde rather than (2,2-dimethyl3-acetyl)-cyclobutyl formate as the monomer partner of #82 and #108, which elute at earlier
RT (18.88 and 19.25 min) compared with #1 and #3 (20.70 and 20.97 min), consistent the
increased polarity due to the addition of -OH functional group. However, 1-hydroxy
pinonaldehyde could also be possible candidate. Therefore, the structures of #82 and #108
are suggested at confidence level 3. Similarly, we tentatively assign (2,2-dimethyl-3-acetyl)cyclobutyl formate as the monomer partner of #30 and #22, though other unknown structures
of MW=184 may exist. Interestingly, by gathering all information from the three isomeric pairs
of SOZs (#1 and #3, #30 and #22, #82 and #108), they show a highly consistent eluting order,
e.g. the one with higher k1st value always elutes earlier, with a factor of 2-6 difference in τ1/e.
Among the 12 organic peroxides, #5 (C10H18O4) is the most uncertain one, which is expected
from bimolecular reaction between C10 SCI and H2O, leading the formation of HAHP that
belongs to ROOH. However, the k1st value of #5 (0.042 d-1) does suggest to be a very slowly
reactive peroxide, likely belonging to ROOR. Therefore, the structure of #5 is only tentatively
assigned with confidence level 3.

Most of these SCI-derived organic peroxides in α-pinene SOA have not been proposed before.
We provide solid evidence for elucidation their possible structures by collecting different
aspects of information from SOA iodometry kinetics experiments, liquid-phase ozonolysis
experiments, and chromatographic eluting and polarity analysis. Some of them are subject to
further detailed and accurate structural characterization, e.g. NMR analysis. Nevertheless, the
above examples clearly reinforce the fact that the peroxide-iodide reactivity is a useful metric
for elucidating the formation pathways and structures of organic peroxide in SOA.

Based on this novel time-dependent iodometry-assisted LC-HRMS and non-targeted analysis,
we have accurately identified more than 300 organic peroxides in α-pinene SOA, with diverse
range of their reactivity with iodide over four orders of magnitudes. Such diverse peroxideiodide reactivity suggests their diverse structures, especially a large fraction (>65%) of organic
peroxides showing “slow” and “very slow” iodide reactivity with an e-folding lifetime longer than
1 day. For these “very slow” peroxides, they tend to have structures such as R(C=O)OOR or
ROOR. This is qualitatively consistent with the reactivity characterization for both commercial
peroxides with known structures and some newly proposed structures of SCI-derived organic
peroxides (mainly SOZs) identified in α-pinene SOA.

We suggest peroxide-iodide reactivity to be considered as a new metric for future organic
peroxide studies with the following two main reasons. Firstly, the peroxide-iodide reactivity is
a fundamental chemical property, which provides valuable sub-class structure information for
organic peroxide. MS2 and MSn are known to be useful for structure characterization for
unknown compounds, which have been applied to SOA studies.31, 32 However, the long list of
structure candidates predicted by MS2 (e.g. SIRIUS, Mass Frontier) is still the main
challenging issue. The peroxide-iodide reactivity would be helpful for more accurate structural
characterization of organic peroxide, especially to narrow down the candidate structures
predicted by MS2 within a more confident range. Secondly, the peroxide-iodide reactivity
metric indicates the oxidizing capability of organic peroxide. As shown in Fig. 4, good
correlation was found between peroxide-iodide reactivity (determined in this study) and
oxidative potential (OP), where the OP data were extracted from the literature 33 for available
peroxide standards. Such good correlation between the two independent measurements
suggests that peroxide-iodide reactivity might be extrapolated to OP metric in future health
assessment, where OP is actually defined by the dithiothreitol (DTT) loss rate from individual
redox-active species as a proxy of total oxidative capacity. However, the OP measurement is
not the focus of this study, and more experimental evidences are still needed to correlate
peroxide-iodide reactivity with peroxide toxicity.

Another potential implication might be linked to Fenton-like reactions involving organic
peroxides. It is known that Fe2+ reacts with PAA very fast and its rate constant has been
recently determined at 0.1~1×105 M–1 s–1 under pH=3-7,34 which is 2-3 orders of magnitudes
higher than that of H2O2 (~77 M–1 s–1)35. This is quite similar to the oxidation of iodide by PAA

and H2O2. Very recently, it is shown that PAA and 3-CA can exhibit strong ability to generate
OH radicals (the so-called OH burst) when mixing with Fe2+ in the bulk solution, while such
OH burst is not observed in H2O2 and other organic peroxides such as CH, t-BH, etc.36
Therefore, organic peracids present in aerosol particles likely contribute to the OH burst
phenomenon. Such metric of peroxide-iodide reactivity will be useful to further identify some
atmospherically important organic peroxides in SOA that are favourable to involve the above
Fenton-like reactions, especially leading to the formation of OH radicals with higher yields.
These will help to understand the OH sources related to aerosol-cloud chemistry especially in
marine environment where irons are abundant.37, 38

This novel analytical strategy based on peroxide-iodide reactivity is demonstrated to expand
the molecular-level identification capability of organic peroxides in SOA, which offers
numerous opportunities to further study their detailed formation and transformation chemistry
on a molecular scale. For example, though only α-pinene SOA is investigated in this study,
such methodology could be extended to many other SOA systems with different precursors
and conditions or even ambient samples. In addition, disentangling the molecular composition
of organic peroxides from different reaction pathways could be achieved through welldesigned targeted experiments, e.g. by introducing OH, HO2, RO2 or SCI scavengers. It should
be noted that the iodometry kinetic experiments for α-pinene SOA was performed at 8 ℃ (kept
at autosampler) and in the presence of 30 mM acetic acid. We believe such peroxide-iodide
reactivity can be accelerated by adjusting the solvent acidity and increasing the temperature.
This would allow the whole analytical method to be shortened and therefore not necessarily
limited by four weeks as presented in this study. Overall, this study reveals the importance of
peroxide-iodide reactivity, which should be a key step for improving our molecular
understanding of organic peroxides in atmospheric aerosols in the future.
