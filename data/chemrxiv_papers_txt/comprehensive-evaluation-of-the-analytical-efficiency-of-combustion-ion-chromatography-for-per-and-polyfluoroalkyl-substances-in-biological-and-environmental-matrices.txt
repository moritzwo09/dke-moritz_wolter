Abstract
Combustion ion chromatography (CIC) has emerged as a highly valuable tool in the analysis of
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in biological and environmental samples, to determine
total fluorine content. The information from CIC complements results from targeted analysis using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and indicates the presence of
many other organofluorine compounds that remain unaccounted for by the latter technique.
However, the effect of different matrices and PFAS types on combustion efficiency has not been
systematically evaluated, such as varying chain lengths and head groups, different combustion
times, and different types of matrices. Comparison of PFAS with chain lengths of C4 to C12 using
equal fluorine equivalents of 5.27 nmol (100 ng) demonstrated no significant differences in the
CIC responses, indicating uniform combustion. Further, no significant differences in signal were
observed between combustion times ranging from 7.5 to 15 min. However, fluorotelomer alcohols
(FTOHs) exhibited losses due to volatility, which could be mitigated using activated carbon,

improving intensities by 200-1400%. Variations in matrix exhibited no observable changes in
PFAS combustion efficiency for all chain lengths in water, blood, and biosolid matrix. To validate
further, CIC was applied in the analysis of real blood and biosolid samples to compare the total
fluorine concentrations observed with the concentrations determined by LC-MS/MS. The results
of this study highlight the strengths and limitations of CIC as an important complementary method
for PFAS analysis for different matrices and provide guidance for optimizing conditions for
specific applications and for proper interpretation of CIC results.
Introduction
Concerns surrounding organofluorine (OF) chemicals as environmental pollutants, especially perand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), have increased worldwide due to the growing evidence of
their ubiquity, persistence, and negative health impacts.1-3 PFAS are a broad class of chemicals
with over 12,000 unique structures with varying degrees of fluorination, ranging from partially to
fully fluorinated carbon backbones, with a polar head group such as a carboxylate, sulfonate,
sulfonamide, quaternary amines or alcohols.4 PFAS have been detected in diverse environmental
samples, from groundwater5-7 to dust and atmospheric sources,8-10 in addition to drinking water.7
Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established health-based maximum
contaminant levels (MCLs) for five PFAS in drinking water, including 4.0 part per trillion (ppt)
limits for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and 10 ppt
limits for perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and
hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) (also known as GenX Chemicals).11 The EPA
is also regulating mixtures of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid
(PFBS). The potential for negative environmental and human health impacts posed by PFAS

coupled to their diverse chemistries and ubiquity necessitates a comprehensive and sensitive
approach to PFAS analysis.12
The most utilized tool for analyzing individual PFAS is liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), targeting a discrete set of analytes for quantification based on isotope
dilution with 13C-labeled PFAS analogues.12-14 Current methods established by EPA for PFAS in
drinking water are EPA methods 53315 and 537.1,16 which enable detection of 18 and 28 PFAS,
respectively, while EPA Method 1633 is generally used to analyze for 40 PFAS in biosolids and
tissue samples.17 Despite the emphasis on the analysis of a limited number of PFAS by LCMS/MS, the environmental burden attributable to PFAS is the result of thousands of different
PFAS species, many of which are not amenable to LC-MS/MS analysis due to low recoveries
during sample extraction, lack of retention in the LC column, and poor ionization efficiencies
during MS detection. Consequently, LC-MS/MS analysis is likely to underestimate the quantity
of PFAS in the samples of interest. Subsequently, total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay is often
used to gain more information on the presence of unknown PFAS that may be precursors to
perfluoroalkyl acids; however, not all fluorinated compounds can be oxidized and not all products
have been identified.18, 19 The use of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) techniques are
increasingly being used for non-target analysis and suspect screening of unknown PFAS for more
robust identification; however, HRMS requires the compounds be ionizable, which may not be the
case, while the lack of available reference standards limits the ability to fully quantify newly
identified compounds, allowing only for semi-quantification.20 Hence, there is a critical need for
a method to complement traditional LC-MS/MS and HRMS analyses and capture the distribution
of fluorinated compounds to evaluate the total organofluorine (TOF) burden in environmental and
biological compartments.

Figure 1. Breakdown of fluorinated compounds and traditional analytical approaches. Total
fluorine (TF) is comprised of both inorganic fluorine (IF) and total organofluorine (TOF). The
TOF is divided into three categories: (1) adsorbable organofluorine (AOF), defined as the mass of
organofluorine (OF) that can be adsorbed from an aqueous sample onto an activated carbon,21 (2)
extractable organofluorine (EOF), defined as the mass of OF that can be extracted into a solvent
system,22 and (3) non-extractable organofluorine (NEOF), defined as the mass of OF not amenable
to extraction by solvents (e.g. polymeric OF).22 In solid samples, EOF Can be followed by
adsorption process as indicated by the broken lines. The EOF is further divided into (i) targeted
fluorine, such as known PFAS that are included in a targeted list of analytes, and (ii) non-targeted
fluorine, such as emerging and previously unidentified PFAS, which account for the discrepancy
between the EOF and the fluorine content of the targeted PFAS.22
Combustion ion chromatography (CIC) is an attractive complement for the analysis of halogencontaining compounds.22 CIC combines traditional ion chromatography (IC) with a combustion
oven to burn solid and liquid samples in the presence of oxygen and hydrated argon to reduce
organohalides (such as brominated flame retardants, chlorinated pesticides, iodinated
pharmaceuticals, and PFAS) to HX (X= Br, Cl, I, F). The reduced halogens are then transferred to
an absorption tube containing a known volume of deionized water for subsequent analysis by IC.
One study evaluated the limit of detection (LOD) for F-, Cl-, Br-, and I- in CIC and reported 4.3,
1.4, 2.2, and 16 ng/L LOD in water samples, respectively; the CIC was then applied to the detection
of polybrominated biphenyls, brominated flame retardants, and PFOS and demonstrated the

applicability of the CIC method to assess flue gas and fly ash contamination by organohalogens.23
Typically, the analysis of PFAS in water involves solid-phase extraction (SPE) to pre-concentrate
and prepare the samples for LC-MS/MS analysis. However, this conventional approach results in
varying recovery efficiencies for different PFAS species due to their differences in solubilities and
adsorption affinities to the SPE sorbent, which are also affected differently by the types of
interferences present in the samples such as natural organic matter, ions, and other compounds that
affect extraction. Additionally, shorter-chain PFAS (C2–C4) may not be effectively captured by
common SPE sorbents, resulting in a systematic underestimation of PFAS levels. Recoveries for
PFAS using SPE exhibits recoveries as low as 16%, with the shorter chain (C4-C5) PFAS
exhibiting the lowest recoveries along with sulfonyl fluorides.24 In contrast, CIC analysis does not
require extensive sample cleanup, providing a robust capacity to detect nearly all PFAS by
eliminating the potential loss resulting from the sample preparation steps.
CIC analysis enables the quantification of total fluorine (TF), and differentiates between TOF, and
inorganic fluorine (IF) (Figure 1) with limited sample preparation. Furthermore, the use of CIC
can provide both extractable organofluorine (EOF) and adsorbable organofluorine (AOF),
potentially closing the fluorine mass balance to account for PFAS contamination in the absence of
commercially available standards. Hence, results from CIC analysis complement the information
obtained from targeted LC-MS/MS methods25 and reveal a wider PFAS chemical space that would
otherwise remain unreported in targeted analysis26 because CIC can account for fluorine from both
known PFAS and unidentified extractable PFAS in EOF.
Analyses using CIC can have important applications in biomonitoring, including PFAS analysis
in tissues, serum, and blood.27 Recent examples include analysis of human blood from cohorts of
individuals with historical drinking water contamination from firefighting foams using CIC which

reported EOF concentration ranges of <107 – 592 ng/mL F.28 The elevated EOF levels in blood
enables determination of samples with high PFAS content, which was validated by a fluorine mass
balance analysis using LC-MS/MS target analysis, revealing an average ΣPFAS concentration of
346 ng/mL.28 Another study analyzing 39 PFAS compounds in industrial wastewater, river water,
and air samples reported recoveries of 46-112% and 72-99% and LODs of 0.3 – 0.5 μg/L and 0.1
– 0.2 µg/L using the AOF and EOF, respectively.28 Significantly higher TOF were measured in
the samples compared to the LC-MS/MS, demonstrating that the combination of the two
techniques have the ability to comprehensively measure total PFAS, including known and
unknown OF species.29 Despite the increasing number of CIC applications in PFAS analysis,
questions related to the combustion efficiency of different PFAS representing diverse chainlengths, degrees of fluorination, and headgroup functionalities remain unanswered. A previous
study suggested that combustion efficiency is dependent on the chain length, with longer chain
PFAS (C11) exhibiting incomplete combustion compared to the shorter chain PFAS.22
This study aims to systematically evaluate factors affecting the combustion efficiency and
analytical performance of CIC for PFAS analysis. Several factors were investigated to determine
whether: (1) the combustion efficiencies are the same between IF (e.g. potassium chloride, KF)
and OF compounds (e.g. PFAS); (2) the length of combustion time impacts combustion
efficiencies of PFAS analysis by CIC; (3) the PFAS structure (e.g. carbon backbone length, degree
of fluorination, different head groups) affect combustion efficiency; and (4) the different types of
sample matrices influence combustion efficiencies of PFAS. To comprehensively evaluate these
variables, combustion efficiencies of different PFAS compounds with different head groups and
varying carbon chain length (C3–C13) were investigated and compared to KF that is traditionally
used as the calibration standard for fluoride ion quantification. To determine the effect of

combustion times, different carboxylated PFAS with increasing chain lengths were combusted at
times ranging from 7.5 – 15 min. The effect of sample matrix on CIC signal was investigated by
comparing combustion efficiencies of PFAS in biosolids and blood. Based on the results of these
studies, an optimized CIC method for biosolids was developed and validated for determination of
TF, AOF, and targeted PFAS in two types of biosolids with varying organic matter content. Results
from this study provide critical information that will advance the quantitative applications of CIC
as a complementary analytical technique for closing the gap in accounting of the fluorine content
in PFAS contaminated samples.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
The list of sources of PFAS standards are listed in Table S1. The American Chemical Society
(ACS) grade >99% potassium fluoride and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). LC-MS grade methanol (MeOH) and acetonitrile (ACN) were
purchased from Omnisolv® through EMD Millipore Sigma (Saint Louis, MO). Ammonium
acetate (ACS grade) formic acid (88%, ACS grade) was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg,
NJ). NanopureTM, 18.2 MΩ water was generated using a Barnstead NanopureTM Diamond
(Waltham, MA) system. CarbopackTM graphitized carbon black (GCB) (120 – 400 mesh) was
obtained from EMD Millipore Sigma (Saint Louis, MO).
Combustion Ion Chromatography (CIC) Instrumentation and Quantification
Fluoride ion concentrations were determined using ThermoScientific Dionex ICS-6000 DC ion
chromatograph (IC) (West Palm Beach, FL) coupled with a Mandel AQF-2100H combustion
system (Houston, TX). Inlet and outlet furnace temperatures were set at 900oC and 1000oC,

respectively. Argon and oxygen gases were set at flow\ rates of 200 and 400 mL/min, respectively.
Oxygen was used as combustion gas ensuring the sample burns completely and converts any
halogens into their corresponding volatile compounds such as hydrogen halides, while argon
transfers the combustion products into the subsequent steps without reacting with them. The
resulting combustion gases are passed through an absorption solvent (NanopureTM water) set at 10
mL. This solution is then injected into the IC unit where anion separation was achieved using a
Dionex IonPacTM AS18-Fast column (2 x 150 mm, 4 μm) (West Palm Beach, FL) at a flow rate of
0.25 mL/min with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in NanopureTM water as
the eluent. The ion chromatography gradient elution program started with a 10 mM of KOH held
for 4 min, then increased to 40 mM KOH in 1 min, and held for 3 min before returning to 10 mM
KOH in 1 min; The total run is 13 min with equilibration time of 4 min. An external standard
calibration of KF ranging from 0.12 – 24.8 nmol of fluoride as KF in NanopureTM was used for
quantification.
PFAS Extractions in Blood for LC-MS/MS Analysis
Whole blood samples (100 µL) were placed in a centrifuge tube with 200 µL of 0.1 M formic acid.
The samples were vortex for 1 min and sonicated for 10 min. A 900-µL aliquot of cold (-20°C)
50:50 ACN:MTBE solution (extraction solution A) was added, vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged
at 20,817 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and placed in a clean 1.7-mL polypropylene
(PP) centrifuge tube. A second 900-µL aliquot of cold (-20°C) extraction solution A was added to
the remaining blood materials, vortexed for one min, and centrifuged at 20,817 × g for 5 min. The
supernatants were combined, and 50 mg of GCB were added for sample cleanup and vortexed for
10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 3234 × g. The supernatant was removed and placed in a clean
PP centrifuge tube. A 1-mL portion of cold (-20°C) extraction solution A was added to the

remaining GCB, vortexed for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3234 × g as a wash. The
supernatant was removed, combined with the others, then dried under nitrogen (25°C). Extracts
were fortified with internal standards (100 µg/L of 13C4-PFOA and 13C4-PFOS) and resuspended
in 50% mobile phase A (95:5 (v/v) 5 mM ammonium acetate:ACN) and 50% of mobile phase B
(50:50 (v/v) MeOH:ACN) to a final volume of 200 µL for LC-MS/MS analysis following the
method reported in Camdzic et al (2023).30
PFAS Extractions in Biosolids for LC-MS/MS Analysis
For each sample, 250 mg of lyophilized and homogenized biosolids were placed in a 50-mL PP
centrifuge tube for extraction.13 Samples were fortified with 25 μL of 1 ppm labelled PFAS mix
(MPFAC-24ES, Wellington Labs, Guelph, ON, Canada) and vortexed for 30 s to homogenize. A
7.5 mL volume of 1% acetic acid in NanopureTM water was added, vortexed for 30 s, and sonicated
at 60°C for 20 min (35 kHz, 180 W). Samples were then centrifuged at 3234 × g, for 40 min at
ambient temperature, and the supernatants collected in a clean 50-mL PP tube. A 1.7 mL solution
of 1% acetic acid in 90:10 MeOH:H2O was then added, vortexed, sonicated at 60°C for 20 min,
then centrifuged at 3234 × g for 40 min at ambient temperature. The extraction was performed in
three cycles, combining each sample’s supernatant. Pooled supernatants were then loaded onto
C18 cartridges (3 cc, 500 mg, WatersTM Sep-Pak, Milford, MA). Cartridges were pre-conditioned
with 3 mL of methanol followed by 3 mL of 1% acetic acid in water, leaving some water in the
cartridge to prevent drying out. The loaded samples in the SPE cartridges were eluted with 6 mL
of methanol (by gravity flow) into a clean 15 mL PP centrifuge tube. Eluents were cleaned by
adding 50 mg of GCB, vortexed for 30 s, then centrifuged at 3234 × g for 15 min at 4oC.
Supernatant was transferred to a clean 15-mL PP tube and dried at ambient temperature under
nitrogen gas. Dried extracts were finally resuspended in 250 μL of 50% mobile phase A (95:5 (v/v)

analyzed by LC-MS/MS.30
Results and Discussions
Comparison of calibration based on IF and OF
To determine whether the CIC signals generated from equimolar concentrations of fluoride from
an IF source versus an OF source are comparable, stock solutions of potassium fluoride (KF) and
PFPrA, each containing 5.27 nmol or 100 ng of fluorine, were separately prepared in NanopureTM
water and then analyzed using CIC. PFPrA was selected as a representative organofluorine
compound to be compared with KF, as it is an ultra-short chain PFAS with limited and manageable
volatility which would otherwise bias the results. No statistical difference in the signals obtained
from combustion of KF and PFPrA were observed (p > 0.05, t-test), suggesting that both organic
and inorganic forms of fluorine result in similar combustion efficiencies and responses (Figure
2A). Consequently, a calibration curve of 0.12 – 24.8 nmol of fluoride as KF in NanopureTM water
was constructed demonstrating a high degree of linearity (R2 = 0.9999) (Figure 2B). The
calibration curve was then used to quantify the fluorine content of different PFAS analyzed by
CIC relative to the KF standard. Experimental results were compared to the theoretical quantity of
fluorine for each PFAS (2.63 nmol or 50 ng F-), by determining the combustion response as a
surrogate for recovery (Equation 1). Recoveries ranged from 85.8 – 117% (Table 1), indicating
that the amount of fluorine expected from different PFAS compounds can be accurately quantified
using a calibration curve generated from KF. Using a single standardized calibration curve is
essential to avoid complications when dealing with PFAS mixtures that have varying degrees of
fluorination and other unknown fluorinated compounds.

Studies have demonstrated the utility of CIC for evaluating the total fluorine or EOF but with the
assumption that all fluorinated analytes have the same combustion efficiency.31 Combustion
efficiencies for perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with increasing chain lengths (C4–C12),
dissolved in methanol, were evaluated at different combustion times, 7.5, 10, and 15 min. Shortchain PFAS (C3-C5) are considered volatile to semi-volatile (vapor pressures (VP) from 7.0-19.0
mmHg), while longer chains are not (VP around 1.0×10-03 mmHg).32-34 Consequently, we
suspected that the short-chain PFAS will require shorter combustion times, while longer chains
would require longer combustion times. The resulting signals were normalized to the signal of an
equimolar standard of KF (Figure 3A). The responses for the C4 to C12 PFAS were not significantly
different (p > 0.05, ANOVA), even at different combustion times. This finding is in contrast to the
report by Aro et al.22 which indicated that combustion efficiencies decreased with increasing chain
lengths of PFCAs. The CIC responses for carboxylates, sulfonates, and fluorotelomer alcohols
(FTOHs) of varying chain lengths (C6, C8, C10, and C12), each containing 5.27 nmol of fluorine,
were combusted for 10 min to evaluate the impact of different head groups on combustion
efficiencies (Figure 3B and 3C). The resulting signals were again normalized to an equimolar KF
standard (Figure 3B). No significant differences were observed in the combustion responses for
the carboxylates (p > 0.05, ANOVA) across the evaluated chain lengths, with recoveries ranging
from 80-140% (Figure 3C). On the other hand, varying chain lengths of the sulfonated PFAS
showed significant differences in the responses due to the low signal of the longest chain length
tested (C12, PFDoS, perfluorododecanesulfonic acid). Interestingly, the shorter chain FTOHs (C4 –
C8) generated lower signals compared to the longest chain length (C12) FTOHs. This can be likely
attributed to the volatilization of the shorter chain FTOHs prior to injection to the CIC. FTOHs are
known to be the volatile PFAS group as their vapor pressure range from 7.44 – 1.01 mmHg.35

The use of adsorbent material for volatile PFAS
To address the loss of volatile PFAS, such as FTOH, in aqueous samples during combustion in
CIC, the use of an adsorptive material was explored to minimize volatilization in the pre-analysis
steps. Each FTOH, containing 5.27 nmol of fluorine in NanopureTM water, were spiked onto 40
mg of activated carbon (Mandel Scientific Inc, Houston, TX), combusted for 10 min, and analyzed
by ion chromatography. Activated carbon effectively adsorbs PFAS due to its high surface area,
porous structure, and hydrophobic nature, which allows it to trap PFAS. It also has electrostatic
properties that enhance its ability to attract and retain negatively charged PFAS headgroups,

making it suitable for removing PFAS from various environmental matrices, including water.36
Additionally, it enables capture of volatile PFAS compounds like FTOHs that may otherwise be
lost.37 Results indicated a significant increase in normalized responses for all the FTOHs with no
significant differences (p > 0.05, ANOVA) across different FTOH chain lengths. Utilizing
adsorption methods with activated carbon material presents a promising approach for minimizing
the loss of volatile PFAS in liquid samples during CIC analysis.
Effect of different sample matrices on combustion
The combustion efficiency of different chain lengths of PFCAs were also investigated in biosolids
and blood samples to represent environmental and biological matrices, respectively. Different
PFCAs with increasing chain lengths were spiked into NanopureTM water, blood and biosolids
such that each sample received equal quantities of fluorine (5.27 nmol) from each PFCA evaluated.
Because the biosolid samples utilized in this experiment contained IF, 10 different biosolid
aliquots were homogenized and analyzed by CIC to determine the baseline total fluorine response
per milligram of biosolid. The signals for spiked biosolid samples were then corrected by
subtracting the average F- signal of non-spiked biosolid samples. Blood samples used in this
experiment had undetectable background fluorine levels. Figure 4 illustrates the PFCA responses
at varying chain lengths across the tested matrices. Generally, the PFCAs showed no significant
variation between matrices, nor were there significant differences observed within each matrix (p
> 0.05, ANOVA). However, responses for longer-chain PFCAs in biosolids were statistically
different (p < 0.05, pairwise t-test) and lower than the responses observed in water and blood. This
may be attributed to the manner by which IF signals were subtracted from the TF signals as
required to determine the signals originating from PFAS spiked in the biosolids. This suggests that

Optimizing sample loop volume in absorption unit
As previously described, CIC requires combustion of fluorinated compounds at high-temperature
conditions to reduce OF to hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is transferred to an absorption tube and
analyzed via ion chromatography. However, the injection volume may be critical to obtaining
measurable F- signals, particularly for trace levels of OF. The loop volume determines the volume
of sample injected into the ion chromatograph with larger volume loops allowing for increased
sample loading and enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, excessively large loops may lead to
column or suppressor overload, adversely affecting chromatographic peak shapes and resolution.
The effect of sample loop volume on the F- response from KF was evaluated using three different
injection loop volumes: 100 µL, 200 µL, and 500 µL (Figure S1). Altering the loop volume
resulted in linear response curves with increasing fluoride mass injected. As expected, the

calculated slopes increased with larger volume injections with slopes of 0.0153 μS/nmol, 0.0238
μS/nmol, and 0.0446 μS/nmol observed for 100 µL, 200 µL, and 500 µL loops, respectively
(Figure 5). These observed results demonstrate improved sensitivity, enabling quantitative analysis
of lower fluoride concentrations at detection limits of 4.22 ng (0.22 nmol), 2.01 ng (0.11 nmol),
and 1.09 ng (0.057 nmol), for the 100 µL, 200 µL, and 500 µL loops, respectively. Determining
the optimal loop length for CIC analysis is often overlooked. However, it is important to emphasize
that the choice of loop and injection volume should be a critical parameter in developing a CIC
method to detect low concentrations of PFAS. Miyake et al. has demonstrated that by using a 1500
µL injection volume of absorbent, they were able to achieve an LOD of 1.5 ng/mL of fluorine in
human blood samples.31

The TF and TOF content in biosolids samples collected from a wastewater treatment facility (n =
3, from a blind study) and random human serum samples (n = 7, from a blind study) were
determined using CIC and compared to the targeted PFAS detected via LC-MS/MS for
comparison. Two types of biosolids, primary solids (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS) were
extracted and analyzed.

Activated sludge is a common biological treatment approach,38

characterized by the aggregation and sedimentation of microorganisms and organic substances
within the clarification chamber, resulting in the formation of WAS.39 The accumulated sludge is
routinely collected, subjected to digestion processes, and subsequently treated with lime for
stabilization to generate PS and facilitate disposal via land application,13 presenting an important
point of PFAS release to the environment.12, 40 Of 40 PFAS targeted by LC-MS/MS, 11 were
detected in PS samples: 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (4:2 FTS), 1H, 1H, 2H,
2H-Perfluorodecane sulfonic acid (8:2 FTS), N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetic acid (NEtFOSAA), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), PFOS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA),
perfluoroheptanoic acid

(PFHpA), PFOA, PFNA, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and

perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA), while 15 PFASdetected in WAS: 4:2 FTS, 8:2 FTS, FOSA,
N-EtFOSAA, PFBS, PFOS, PFHxA, PFPHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, perfluoroundecanoic acid
(PFUDA) and PFDoA, perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid
(PFTeDA) (Table 2). Concentrations of PFAS detected in PS and WAS ranged from 0.5 - 17.6
µg/L and 0.5 – 41.7 µg/L, respectively. These detections showed WAS samples contained higher
concentrations of PFAS than the PS samples. CIC analysis revealed total fluoride quantities
ranging from 117.5 – 144.1 ng and 417.2 – 458.7 ng for PS and WAS, respectively. The elevated
PFAS levels found in WAS compared to PS indicate that dewatering and treatment processes may
help lower the fluorinated compounds in biosolid samples.13 Importantly, the fluorine mass

attributable to the PFAS detected by LC-MS/MS in the biosolids was substantially lower than
indicated by CIC analysis (Figure 6). These results indicate that biosolids contain additional OF
compounds beyond the 40 targeted PFAS in the LC-MS/MS method. As biosolids originate from
wastewater sludges, the presence of IF from domestic waste, for example from sodium fluoride
(NaF) (commonly used in drinking water fluoridation and found in most toothpaste products), adds
to the overall fluorine content in biosolids and would not be captured by LC-MS/MS analysis.
Further, conventional LC-MS/MS methods using C18 LC columns underreport PFAS content, as
they fail to retain trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and other ultra-short chain PFAS, however, this study
also detected significant amounts of TFA in wastewater samples using fluorine nuclear magnetic
resonance (19F-NMR).41 Moreover, targeted LC-MS/MS analyses generally only include
negatively charged PFAS, systematically excluding positively charged and neutral and amphoteric
PFAS.12 Further, any excreted fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds that are discharged into
domestic waste streams, such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, antidepressants, and other fluorinated
materials, will also contribute to the total fluorine content in the biosolids.42

Of the 40 PFAS targeted by LC-MS/MS, five were detected in seven serum samples,
including: PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFOS. Concentrations ranged from 0.5 µg/L to 4.6
µg/L (Table 3). PFOA was detected in all serum samples, while PFOS and PFNA were present in
most samples with detection frequencies of 57% and 71%, respectively. However, CIC analysis
using a 200 µL sample loop did not detect elevated TF content, indicating that blood samples’ TF
content were below the 2.5 ng F- detection limit. The fluoride content in each blood sample, based
on the detected PFAS via target analysis, ranged from 0.09 to 0.95 ng, which suggests that there
are likely no other types of PFAS in the blood sample that are not included in the targeted analytes.

Analysis by CIC can determine TF but it is not able to differentiate between different types of
fluorine sources. While the EOF compounds are present in the extracts prepared for LC-MS/MS
analysis, it is important to note that the extracts may still contain IF. Implementing an AOF
preparation procedure effectively removes the IF, leaving only the OF.29 Adsorbable OF was used
prior to combustion analysis of the biosolids. The aqueous extracts from the PS and WAS were
passed through an activated carbonF sorbent, which was then analyzed via CIC. At the same time,
2.5 mg of the original samples were also directly analyzed by CIC to account for the TF present in
the biosolids. Interestingly, the mass of fluoride determined by LC-MS/MS analysis only
accounted for 5.11 ± 0.01 % and 0.748 ± 0.001 % of all the fluorine compounds detected by direct
CIC, while AOF captured 27.00 ± 0.03% and 17.82 ± 0.04% in PS and WAS samples, respectively
(Figure 6). The additional fluoride detected via AOF may be attributed to the presence of other
PFAS or organofluorine compounds. The remaining fluoride representing 67.89 ± 0.04% and
81.44 ± 0.04% for PS and WAS, respectively, (Figure 6) may either be in the form of IF, additional
EOF that are not adsorbed on the activated carbon used in AOF, or NEOF. These results
demonstrate the capacity of CIC to complement LC-MS/MS analysis for screening PFAS and other
fluorinated compounds in environmental samples. Because CIC is unable to differentiate between
IF and TOF, a suitable extraction procedure followed by an AOF cleanup is necessary to
effectively distinguish OF, such as PFAS, from IF compounds.

Conclusions
The complexity of PFAS in environmental and biological matrices pose significant challenges for
accurate detection and quantification. With over 12,000 unique PFAS structures, traditional
analytical methods face important limitations in their ability to capture the full spectrum of these
compounds. LC-MS/MS has been instrumental in detecting PFAS in environmental and biological
samples, offering robust detection capabilities. However, the targeted nature of LC-MS/MS
methods underreport PFAS burden. To address this limitation, CIC emerged as a promising
technique for assessing TOF content in various matrices, including complex samples such as
biosolids and blood.
Efforts in this study to optimize CIC for PFAS analysis have revealed insights into various factors
affecting combustion efficiency and sensitivity of the method. Assessment of combustion
efficiency showed combustion times and PFAS chain lengths did not significantly influence CIC
responses, with the exception of the signal detected in PFDoS. Overall, uniform combustion

capacity across different PFAS compounds were observed. It was obseved that the use of
adsorbable materials such as activated carbon can minimize losses of volatile PFAS during
analysis, resulting in improved recoveries. Matrix effects were also evaluated, demonstrating
consistent PFAS combustion efficiency in complex environmental matrices like biosolids and
blood. No significant differences were observed between the responses of IF and OF standard,
hence, quantification of PFAS in various matrices can be achieved using a KF calibration curve.
The use of CIC to complement LC-MS/MS analyses offers a comprehensive approach to PFAS
analysis, enabling the determination of TOF content alongside targeted PFAS species.
Additionally, the application of CIC in conjunction with SPE and adsorption techniques allows for
differentiation between AOF and IF, shedding light on the distribution of AOF compounds in
environmental samples. Overall, the development and optimization of CIC methodologies
represent a crucial step towards accurate reporting of PFAS and enhancing our understanding of
PFAS contamination in the environment and elsewhere.
