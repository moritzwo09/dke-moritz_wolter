Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants that pose
significant health risks. With recent regulatory guidelines lowering safe drinking water advisory limits
to parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) levels, the need for methods capable of detecting and quantifying many
PFAS simultaneously in trace amounts has become increasingly critical. In this study, six metalorganic frameworks were evaluated as solid-phase extraction sorbents for multiplexed adsorption of
PFAS, followed by quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. UiO-66
demonstrated the highest performance with 87% adsorption efficiency and 85% recovery for 33 PFAS
spiked at 2 parts per billion. In multiplexed adsorption for 50 PFAS at concentrations of 200 ppq,
UiO-66 achieved an average recovery of 75%, with detection limits as low as 4 ppq and an average
detection limit of 108 ppq. Validation using six environmental water samples revealed quantifiable
PFAS in all samples with 25 PFAS detected. Compared to polymeric resins, which typically detect
PFAS in the 1–80 parts per trillion range, UiO-66 demonstrated enhanced sensitivity for multiplexed
adsorption, capable of detecting concentrations in the low ppq range. These findings highlight the
potential of UiO-66 for large-scale PFAS monitoring under increasingly stringent environmental
regulations.

Introduction
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used in industrial applications,
firefighting foams, and everyday products like non-stick cookware and food packaging.1 PFAS
are considered highly amphiphilic molecules consisting of hydrophobic ‘tails’ of inert C-F
bonds and hydrophilic ‘head’ groups such as carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, and
sulfonamides.2 This dual nature allows PFAS to spread easily in water and soil leading to their
accumulation in ecosystems.3 Of particular concern are compounds like perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), which have been linked to serious health
risks and were recently classified as carcinogens.4 As the list of concerning PFAS grows,
expanding monitoring efforts in water beyond just PFOA and PFOS is increasingly crucial.
Current commercial methods for PFAS detection often rely on solid-phase extraction
(SPE) with polymer-based cartridges, which bind PFAS for later analysis by liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).5 For PFAS preconcentration, weak
anion exchange (WAX) cartridges with polymeric resins are commonly used to bind anionic
PFAS and elute them with methanolic ammonium solutions.6, 7 While effective, these
approaches struggle to meet the increasingly stringent regulatory limits set by agencies like the
US EPA, which now require detection at low parts per quadrillion (ppq) levels for compounds
like PFOA and PFOS.8
To meet stricter detection requirements, there is growing interest in advanced materials
for PFAS preconcentration.9, 10 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their highly tunable
structures and large surface areas (Figure 1), have emerged as promising alternatives to WAX
materials for PFAS extraction and detection.11-13 The first application of MOFs for PFAS
adsorption was reported in 2015 with MIL-101(Cr) used to adsorb perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA).14 Since then, 15 MOFs—including MIL-101(Fe, Cr)15, 16 ZIF-7,17 ZIF-8,17 SCU-8,18
UiO-66,19, 20 and NU-100021—have been explored for their ability to adsorb PFAS. Earlier

work focused primarily on high concentrations of PFOA and PFOS for remediation
applications.13 Recently, Li et al. evaluated three MOFs (ZIF-8, UiO-66, and NU-1000) for
PFAS removal from aqueous film forming foam (AFFF)-impacted water finding NU-1000
most effective, particularly for longer-chained PFAS, which can be removed from water at low
concentrations (ppt).21 NU-1000 could remove both anionic and non-ionic PFAS from water
across a concentration range from 3.0 ppt to 250 ppb.

Previous research on MOFs and PFAS has largely centered on their adsorption
mechanisms and effectiveness in PFAS remediation. However, the use of MOFs to enhance
PFAS detection in water—where high sensitivity at trace concentrations is essential—remains
relatively unexplored. Donald and colleagues have previously demonstrated the potential of
ZIF-8 in MOF-based solid-phase microextraction probes, achieving detection limits as low as
11 ppt for PFOA.22 Additionally, Jia et al. reported detection limits of low to sub-ppt for 9 PFAS

using a dual-functional MIL-101(Cr) MOF in combination with liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).23 MOF-based solid-phase extraction methods, such as those
employing UiO-66-F4 and MOF-5, have also shown promise for preconcentrating PFAS, with
detection limits of 2.6 ppt for PFOA and 70 ppt for PFOS, using laser desorption ionization or
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).24-26 While these early studies highlight the
promise of MOFs for detecting PFAS, the focus has typically been on a limited number of
anionic PFAS, primarily in controlled conditions, and scarce use of quantitative LC-MS/MS,
the ‘gold standard’ for accurate PFAS quantitation with isotopically labeled standards.
In this study, we address key challenges in PFAS detection by use of multiplexed PFAS
adsorption with MOFs to achieve low parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) detection limits through
quantitative LC-MS/MS. Six MOFs were evaluated for their adsorption efficiency across 33
PFAS, with six elution solutions tested to optimize recovery. UiO-66 emerged as the most
effective, and its performance was compared to ZIF-8 for the multiplexed adsorption of 50
PFAS, including zwitterionic (6:2 FTAB), cyclic (PFECHS), and chlorinated (9Cl-PF3ONS,
11Cl-PF3OUdS) species at concentrations of 200 ppq and 20 ppt. The method was applied to
environmental water samples from Sydney, Australia. This approach broadens the scope of
PFAS detected using MOFs, enhancing both sensitivity and real-world applicability of MOFbased detection technologies.
Results and Discussion
Materials selection and characterization. Six MOFs from two MOF families (ZIF-8
and UiO-66) were chosen for investigation (Figure 1). These materials can be readily
synthesized in gram-scale quantities,27, 28 are stable in water samples across a broad range of
pH values,29, 30 contain different functional groups capable of anion and cation exchange
(amines and sulfonic acids) and a wide range of pore sizes (8 – 22 Å). In Figure 1b and f, the
pore structures of the two MOF families are shown. These MOFs have distinct structural

characteristics that influence their molecular adsorption characteristics. ZIF-8, composed of
zinc ions and 2-methylimidazolate ligands, has a zeolite-like sodalite structure with high
porosity and large pore windows. In contrast, UiO-66 consists of zirconium oxide clusters
(Figure 1g) and terephthalate ligands, forming a robust face-centered cubic lattice with smaller,
stable pores. Using different organic linkers (Figure 1d and h) while maintaining the same
general framework shape can significantly alter the pore characteristics, such as size, shape,
and surface functionality, which in turn affects their adsorption properties, stability, and
molecular adsorption properties. For example, the incorporation of extra functional groups,
larger ligands and tailored defect sites can incorporate amines (ZIF-8A-61%, UiO-66-NH₂) and
sulfonic acid (ZIF-8A-SO₃H) groups into the pores and create materials with larger pores (UiO67 and defective UiO-66).
The six MOFs of interest were synthesized using literature methods and characterized
by use of BET and PXRD experiments (Table S1 and Figure S1). The surface areas, pore sizes
and the crystalline diffraction patterns were consistent with previously reported data for these
six materials, with measured surface areas within 10% of literature data (20% for ZIF-8A61%)27, 31-37 and powder diffraction results were in reasonable agreement with characteristic
Bragg reflection positions calculated from crystal structures.35, 38 For ZIF-8A-61%, NMR was
used to confirm and quantify the partial conversion of the methylated ZIF-8 ligand, 2methylimidazole, to the aminated 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole found in ZIF-8A with a yield of ~61%
(Figure S2), consistent with previous research reported in the literature.31
UiO-66 was synthesized with a range of defect states (e.g. missing linkers and cluster
sites) and characterized by BET, PXRD and TGA experiments (Table S2, Figure S3-4). The
surface areas and pore sizes from BET measurements are consistent with defective materials
containing pore sizes of 8, 11, 16, and 18.5 Å, with defective free UiO-66 containing only pore
sizes of 8 and 11 Å. With the addition of increasing amounts of HCl, the surface area decreases

while the distribution of pore sizes shifts towards the larger pore sizes, which agrees with
results reported by Clark et al. based on BET measurements (Table S2).19 The measured powder
diffraction patterns agreed with the simulated patterns out to high angle peaks (2θ beyond 30°)
which ensures that crystalline structures were synthesized. Results from TGA (Figure S4) were
used to approximate the number of defects present in these materials. Using a procedure
reported by Lillerud and co-workers,39 UiO-66-5, UiO-66-10 and UiO-66-25 are respectively
missing ~0.76, ~0.81 and ~1.51 out of 6 linkers per Zr6 formula unit that is expected for the
pristine MOF, which are comparable or slightly lower than previously reported by Clark et al.19
Assessing the analytical capabilities of different MOFs. The structures of the initial 33
PFAS that were measured are shown in Figure 2a, arranged in order of increasing chain length
for each functional head group (carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, sulfonamides, and
fluorotelomers). The analytical capabilities of the six chosen MOFs were assessed in their
performance for the adsorption and elution of 33 PFAS using MOFs as dispersive solid-phase
extraction (dSPE) sorbents, with quantitative isotope dilution LC-MS/MS. The overall results
of the adsorption and elution testing are summarized in Figure 2b as a bubble plot, in which
the extent of adsorption of PFAS is indicated in dark purple and the extent of elution in light
purple, with larger circles representing higher extents of adsorption or elution for each PFAS
using each MOF. Detailed individual PFAS adsorption and elution performance by ZIF-8 and
UiO-66 analogs is shown in Figure S5 and S6. Throughout this work, the process of removing
PFAS from water using MOFs will be referred to as an adsorption process, although there are
likely absorption processes occurring particularly for shorter chain PFAS. When comparing the
six MOFs tested for their PFAS adsorption capabilities, it was found that ZIF-8A-SO3H, UiO66, and UiO-67 adsorb PFAS most effectively with the highest average amount of all 33 PFAS
removed (85%, 87%, and 99% respectively; Table S3). Moreover, UiO-66 has the highest
amount adsorbed and eluted (85%) compared to UiO-67 (80%), ZIF-8A-SO3H (75%), ZIF-

8A-61% (69%), UiO-66-NH2 (62%) and ZIF-8 (46%). UiO-66 elutes 13 individual PFAS
above 90%, and for each individual PFAS, UiO-66 has higher extents of elution than any of
the other five MOFs tested for the vast majority of PFAS (p-value < 0.05) (Table S3). These
data suggest that UiO-66 is the most effective of these MOFs for the adsorption and elution
across all 33 PFAS under these conditions.

Figure 2. The extent of PFAS extraction from water using MOFs and PFAS elution from MOFs depends on the
identity of the MOF, the PFAS head group and the chain length. (a) 33 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) of
environmental concern including 13 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), seven perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs),
seven sulfonamides, four fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (n:2 FTS) and two longer chained PFAS (FOUEA and 8:2
diPaP, black). (b) Extent of PFAS adsorption (A) from water for each MOF, and extent of PFAS elution (E) from
each MOF using methanolic solutions. The size of the circles corresponds to the amount of PFAS that is absorbed
and eluted. Refer to Figure S5 and S6 for the 95% confidence intervals which are on average ±4% of the measured
recovered values for adsorption values and ±5% of the measured recovered values for the elution values across
all 198 individual recovery values.

Although UiO-66 was chosen for further investigations to lower detection limits for
PFAS, the adsorption and elution of sulfonamides remains poor. For an effective adsorbentmolecule pair, strong interactions between the molecule and the adsorbent material are
beneficial and should be stronger than the interactions with water. For effective elution, the
molecule should also have strong interactions with the elution solvent. Additionally, factors
including entropy changes, pore size, and structure can also have important roles. Sulfonamides
such as PFOSA, N-MeFOSA, and N-EtFOSA have higher pKa values than the carboxylic and
sulfonic acid PFAS and are less ionized, reducing the extent of ionic interactions between the
positively charged MOF scaffold and the sulfonamide PFAS. However, UiO-66 has higher
performance for the adsorption and elution of short-chained PFAS, which is of particular
relevance in current detection efforts as polymeric materials tend to have low recoveries for
these compounds.
To further optimize the UiO-66 material, pristine and defective UiO-66 materials were
explored to optimize multiplexed PFAS adsorption from water. Here, four materials were
tested, UiO-66-X (X = 0, 5, 10 and 25, where X represents the volume percent of HCl
concentration added during synthesis to form defect sites, and X = 0 denotes nearly defect free
UiO-66). The average adsorption and elution of 33 PFAS for these UiO-66 materials is shown
in Table S4. The highest overall average adsorption and elution of PFAS occurs with UiO-665. The majority of PFAS are recovered to a greater extent with UiO-66-5 than UiO-66-0, UiO66-10, and UiO-66-25 (p-values < 0.05; Table S4). UiO-66-5 likely has the optimal
combination of pore sizes and abundance for PFAS to be effectively adsorbed by the material,
and these data supports previous findings by Clark et al. where some defectivity in UiO-66
increases the uptake of PFAS.19 Here, UiO-66-5 was the most effective UiO-66 material tested
leading to its use in further experiments.

Lastly, the elution conditions used to extract PFAS from UiO-66 following adsorption
were validated by testing six different elution solvents (Table S5). These six solutions were
chosen to compare previous solutions in literature that regenerate their materials for further
testing. The use of methanolic solutions was found to significantly increase the recovery of
PFAS from UiO-66-5 compared to aqueous solutions. The extent of recovery slightly increases
with the addition of additives such as ammonia, NaCl and HCl. Thus, methanolic solutions
were used to elute PFAS in all further experiments.
Overall, these results provide a comprehensive comparison of six different MOFs for
LC-MS/MS analysis of 33 PFAS, demonstrating the superior performance of UiO-66,
particularly for short-chained PFAS (Figure 2). Previous research has utilized MOFs as
dispersive solid-phase extraction sorbents, analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, GC-MS, or SALDIMS, focusing on seven MOFs tested for either PFOA or PFOS.24-26 The results presented here
provide a direct comparison between MOFs at low concentrations for a broad range of PFAS
using a quantitative isotope dilution targeted LC-MS/MS method.
Multiplexed screening of 50 PFAS at ultra-trace concentrations using MOF sorbents.
To further evaluate UiO-66 as a dSPE material for analyzing PFAS concentrations in aqueous
samples, the PFAS screen was expanded from 33 to 50 compounds. These additional PFAS
include HFPO-DA (Gen-X) and PFEESA which contain alkoxy groups, shorter and longerchained sulfonic acids (PFPrS, PFDoS), fluorotelomers (n:3 FTCA), other phosphoric acids
(6:2 diPAP, 6:2/8:2 diPAP), cyclic PFAS (PFECHS), chlorinated PFAS (9Cl-PF3ONS and
11Cl-PF3OUdS), and 6:2 FTAB, a zwitterionic PFAS. Most of these PFAS have been
introduced to replace longer-chained PFAS such as PFOA and PFOS and may potentially be
less toxic.40 Additionally, some are potential degradation products (PFPrS) or longer-chained
PFAS previously used in industry (PFDoS). Apart from 5:3 FTCA (FPePA), these PFAS have
not been previously tested for adsorption or elution by MOFs.

Both UiO-66 and ZIF-8 were tested, as ZIF-8 has been used previously for analyzing
PFOS of the three ZIF-8 analogs, using laser desorption to quantify concentrations.24 The tests
were conducted at 200 ppq, the lowest reported spike concentration of PFAS in any dSPE MOF
method to date. Extracted ion chromatograms (Figure 3a-f) indicate that UiO-66 can be used
to detect all PFAS, while ZIF-8 detected only half with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio greater
than 3.

At 200 ppq, UiO-66 exhibited higher average S/N for all 50 PFAS (52) than ZIF-8 (30)
(Figures 3g and S7). Moreover, the average recovery across all PFAS at 200 ppq for UiO-66
(73%) was also higher than ZIF-8 (51%) (Figures 3h and S8, Table S6). Testing at 2 ppb also
showed higher percentage recovery with UiO-66 (Figure 2), and similar trends were observed
at 20 ppt (Figures 3i and 3j, Table S6, Figure S7-8). For example, UiO-66 demonstrated nearly
100% recovery on average across all 50 PFAS at 20 ppt, while ZIF-8 was considerably lower
(50%). Moreover, XRD patterns indicated that the MOFs' crystalline structures remained intact
post-PFAS adsorption, demonstrating stability (Figure S9).
With UiO-66 showing promise as a pre-concentration sorbent, the limit of detection
(LOD) was determined for 50 PFAS (Figure 3k and Table S7) by constructing calibration
curves with PFAS solutions from 200-800 ppq, with representative PFAS calibration curves
shown in Figure S10. These calibration curves had average regression values of 0.97, indicating
linearity. The average LOD for 50 PFAS using our dSPE method was 108 ppq, and average
LOQ was 362 ppq. These detection limits are lower than previous dSPE methods using MOFs,
where the use of UiO-66-F4 as a dSPE sorbent had a LOD of 2.6 ppt for PFOA.25 For methods
that quantify more than 40 PFAS, the lowest LODs achieved are in the low ppt range, tested at
2000 ppt.41 In addition to anionic PFAS tested in negative ionization mode, 6:2 FTAB, a
zwitterionic PFAS, in positive ionization mode was also measured using the reported dSPE
MOF method. 6:2 FTAB, a replacement for PFOS in firefighting foams, was detected and
quantified using a MOF for the first time. Although not detectable at 200 ppq, 6:2 FTAB was
detected at concentrations above 0.4 ppt, with quantification limits at 1.3 ppt. Overall, UiO-66
outperformed ZIF-8 as a dSPE sorbent in average recovery and higher S/N ratios, with lower
limits of detection across 50 PFAS, while retaining stability post-adsorption.

UiO-66 for the multiplexed detection of PFAS from environmental water samples. The
efficacy of the UiO-66 dSPE method was tested using environmental water samples collected
from various locations around Sydney. Six different water samples with different matrices were
collected: chlorinated water (Marrickville), tap water (North Ryde), beach water (Kyeemagh),
river water (North Richmond), lagoon water (Richmond), and water from Engine Pond near
Sydney Airport (Mascot). The latter site is a known site of PFAS contamination owing to the
extended legacy of using aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) in firefighting exercises. The
locations are shown on a map in the Supporting Information (Figure S11). The concentrations
and their internal recoveries of each PFAS are given in Figure 4 and Table S8 respectively. Out
of the 50 PFAS tested, 25 PFAS were detected across the six samples above the limit of
quantification (LOQ; Figure 4 and Table S8). Internal standard recoveries were acceptable
(between 70-120%) for most samples, indicating accurate quantification of PFAS (Table S8).
However, lower recoveries of the shortest-chained PFCAs (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA,
and PFOA) in the beach water sample were consistent with competitive binding between PFAS
and high concentrations of counterions in the ocean water sample. To investigate the impact of
counterions on PFAS recovery, tap water samples were spiked with different acids (HCl,
CH3COOH, H2SO4, and H3PO4) to introduce different anions into the solution (Table S9).
Focusing on the recovery of PFCAs (Figure S12) the addition of HCl did not decrease the
percentage recovery of internal standards, as Cl− counterions are already present in the UiO-66
structure from synthesis and do not bind to additional sites. This observation aligns with
previous findings by Clark et al., which also noted that Cl− at 25 mg/L does not decrease PFAS
adsorption by UiO-66.19 However, the study found that with increasing net charge of the added
anion, the adsorption of the shortest-chained PFAS by UiO-66 decreased (in the order of
CH3COO− > SO42− > PO43−). Sulfate and carbonate anions have been shown to competitively
bind to sites occupied by PFAS.12 Our current findings support this notion and indicate that the

presence of more highly charged counterions is a key factor in the reduced adsorption of shortchain PFCAs. Overall, these results demonstrated the potential for MOFs to be used for the
effective preconcentration and analysis of PFAS at ultra-trace levels in environmental water
samples.

respectively. Values are reported in ppt. Only PFAS that were detected above the LOD are shown in the table.
<LOD indicates that the concentration of PFAS was below detection limits, <LOQ indicates that concentration of
that PFAS is below the limit of quantification but above LODs. <LOQ* indicates that the concentration of PFAS
is above the limit of detection, however internal standard recoveries were not between 70-120%.

Briefly, ZIF-8 and ZIF-8 analogs ZIF8A-61% and ZIF-8A-SO3H were prepared via the reaction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 2methylimidazole in methanol, followed by post-synthetic modifications with 3-amino-1,2,4triazole (ZIF-8A-61%) and 1,3-propanesultone (ZIF-8A-SO3H).31 UiO-66 and UiO-66 analogs
UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-67 were synthesized by reacting zirconium chloride with the
corresponding organic ligand in DMF, with defect engineering for UiO-66 achieved by varying
the amount of HCl during synthesis. Characterization data (e.g., PXRD and BET surface area)
were in agreement with literature reports.
Materials characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed using a
PANanalytical X'Pert PRO Diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), scanned at 45
kV, 40 mA with a step size of 2θ = 0.026° over 4 to 50°. Adsorption isotherms were measured
using a 3-Flex Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer (Micromeritics). Samples (30-50 mg) were
outgassed at 150 °C under vacuum for 24 h. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were
determined from N2 isotherms at 77 K using density functional theory modeling for pore size
distribution.42 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TA Discovery Analyzer
under dry air (20 mL/min), heating at 5 °C/min from 40 to 700 °C. 1H and 13C NMR spectra

were recorded at 298 K on a 400 MHz Bruker Avance III HD system by dissolving 5 mg of the
MOF in d6-DMSO (0.5 mL) with concentrated sulfuric acid (0.05 mL, 98%). Ligand
conversion was monitored by comparing peaks of 2-methylimidazole (δ = 7.4 ppm) and 3amino-1,2,4-triazole (δ = 8.2 ppm).
Quantification of PFAS adsorption and elution for six MOFs. PFAS adsorption by six
MOFs was evaluated using a 33 PFAS methanol spike solution (100 ppb), prepared from
standards (Table S10) spiked into water to obtain 2 ppb of each PFAS. Tested elution solvents
included water, methanol, 80/20 methanol/water (v/v), 0.4% ammonia/methanol (v/v), 0.1 M
HCl/methanol (30/70 v/v), and 0.05 M NaCl/methanol (30/70 v/v). MOFs (10 mg) were
activated at 95 °C for 5 h, then added to 10 mL of the spiked water solution (pH 4) and agitated
for 30 min (1 rpm/s). After centrifugation (2800 rpf, 5 min), the supernatant (0.5 mL) was
filtered (0.22 μm nylon membrane) with centrifugation at 1100 rpf for 5 min. The membrane
was cleaned with 0.4% MeOH/NH4 (0.5 mL), followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. PFAS
adsorption by the MOFs was quantified by subtracting the PFAS concentration after adsorption
from a blank sample and comparing it to a control without MOF. Elution was performed by
decanting water from the MOF pellets, adding 10 mL of elution solvent, agitating for 30 min
(1 rpm/s), and centrifuging (1650 rpf, 5 min). The filtered supernatant (1 mL) was analyzed by
LC-MS/MS to determine elution efficiency. Full details regarding the quantification of the
extent of adsorption and elution are in the Supporting Information.
PFAS solutions for limit of detection testing. A 50 PFAS methanol spike solution at 100
ppb was prepared by combining Wellington Laboratories standards PFAC-MXF, PFAC-MXG,
PFAC-MXH, PFAC-MXJ, with 12 individual PFAS standards (Table S10). A 27 isotopically
labelled PFAS internal standard solution at 100 ppb was prepared by combining Wellington
Laboratories standards MPFAC-24ES, with 8 individual isotopically labelled PFAS standards
(Table S11). A 4 PFAS recovery standard solution containing isotopically labelled standards at

20 ppb was prepared using Wellington Laboratories standard MPFAC-C-IS (M3PFBA,
M2PFOA, MPFDA, MPFOS) to determine the percentage of internal standards recovered at
the end of extraction.
Protocol for using dSPE with MOFs for ultra-trace PFAS analysis. Water (~ 250 mL)
containing the 50 PFAS mixture spiked at 100, 200, 400, 600 or 800 ppq (or environmental
water samples) was placed in a polypropylene container. The 27 PFAS internal standard
solution (10 µL, 100 ng/mL) was added, followed by HCl (1 mL, 0.5 M) or alternative acids
(CH3COOH, 1 mL, 0.4 N; H2SO4, 2.5 mL, 0.2 N; H3PO4, 1.5 mL, 2%) to adjust pH to 3-4. The
MOF (100 mg) was dispersed in the water and agitated for 1 h at 0.5 rpm/s. After filtration
through a 0.22 µm nylon membrane using a polysulfone bottle top filter, the MOF was
transferred to a 15 mL tube, dried with nitrogen gas for 15 min, and eluted with 0.4% ammonia
methanol (8 mL) for 30 min at 1 rpm/s. The solution was centrifuged (1650 rpf, 5 min) and the
supernatant methanol was concentrated to 2-3 mL with nitrogen at 40 °C. Milli-Q water (0.25
mL) was added to prevent peak splitting, and the extract was further concentrated to 1 mL.
After adding a recovery standard (50 µL), the solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm nylon
filter and transferred to a 700 µL vial for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Mass spectrometry. A multiple reaction monitoring experiment was conducted in
negative ionization mode using LC-MS/MS (ExionLC AD-SciEx Triple Quad 6500+) with a
C18 column (Waters Acquity UPLC BEH or Phenomenx Luna Omega, both 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.6–
1.7 µm). Quantification was performed using a ten-point calibration (0.025–25 μg/L) with
isotopically labeled internal standards (Table S11). The sample injection volume was 5 µL and
full details of LC-MS/MS parameters are detailed in Tables S12-S14. PFAS were quantified
using internal standards when recoveries were between 70–120%, and results were reported
only when PFAS exceeded the LOQ. LOD and LOQ were calculated from five-point
calibration curves (100-800 ppq). Recoveries for 50 PFAS were compared between sorbent-

Information.

Conclusions
UiO-66 demonstrated the highest performance across both average adsorption (87%)
and recovery (85%) for 33 PFAS spiked in water at 2 ppb. Remarkably, at 200 ppq— the lowest
concentration tested for any MOF in the literature—UiO-66 maintained an average recovery
of 75% across 50 PFAS outperforming MOFs like ZIF-8. Optimization of defect sites on UiO66 found that UiO-66-5, treated with 5% HCl, provided the optimal balance for PFAS
adsorption. This balance likely arises from the creation of additional and larger pores while still
maintaining enough structural integrity to effectively trap and retain PFAS molecules. The
developed multiplexed adsorption protocol, coupled with quantitative isotope dilution LCMS/MS, enabled a direct, first-of-its-kind performance comparison between MOFs at ultratrace PFAS concentrations across a broad range of 50 PFAS including zwitterionic compounds
such as 6:2 FTAB. Detection limits reached as low as 4 ppq, with an average LOD of 108 ppq.
When applied to environmental water samples, UiO-66 was used to detect PFAS contamination
in all samples with 22 PFAS identified in the most affected sample from Sydney Airport.
Internal standard recoveries ranging from 70% to 120% ensured the accuracy and reliability of
PFAS quantitation by correcting for variability in sample preparation and matrix effects, with
nearly 100% recovery observed across all 50 PFAS for UiO-66. In contrast, ZIF-8 showed
considerably lower recovery rates. The study also explored the effect of counterions, finding
that higher-charged counterions (SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻) reduced adsorption of short-chain PFAS, while
Cl⁻ had essentially no effect. Importantly, UiO-66 retained its crystalline structure postadsorption, confirming its stability for practical use. Overall, UiO-66 is a highly effective MOF
for PFAS detection, demonstrating superior recovery, structural integrity, and sensitivity down

to low ppq. This study highlights UiO-66’s potential for comprehensive environmental
monitoring particularly for zwitterionic and cationic PFAS.
