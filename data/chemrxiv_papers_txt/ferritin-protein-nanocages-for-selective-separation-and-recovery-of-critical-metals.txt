ABSTRACT

8

Recycling critical metals from waste streams is increasingly important to meet the rising demand

9

for clean energy technologies and reduce the environmental impact of ore mining. A key step in this process

10

is the selective separation and recovery of high-grade metals from waste leachates containing complex

11

metal mixtures; however, current strategies are limited by high chemical, energy, and resource consumption,

12

substantial financial costs, and production of hazardous byproducts. Herein, we report the pioneering use

13

of ferritin – self-assembling protein nanocages with porous, hollow structures and supercharged inner

14

surfaces – as a high-efficiency biosorbent for eco-friendly, selective metal recovery from mixtures. Ferritin

15

nanocages adsorbed cobalt (Co2+), nickel (Ni2+), and lithium (Li+) primarily through electrostatic

16

interactions, localizing the adsorbed metal cations within their cavities. Adsorption isotherms indicated

17

significantly more effective adsorption of Co2+ and Ni2+ compared to Li+, enabling efficient Co2+/Ni2+

18

separation from Li+. Leveraging ferritin's ability to concentrate adsorbed metal cations within cavities

19

enabled selective recovery of Co2+ as nearly 95% pure solid carbonate salts from Co2+-Li+ mixtures through

20

single-step precipitation under mild conditions, while Li+ remained in solution. This research opens new

21

avenues for using ferritin nanocages in selective metal separation and recovery from waste streams via

22

simple, environmentally benign adsorption-precipitation processes.

INTRODUCTION

32

The ongoing shift toward a low-carbon society is driving an ever-increasing demand for critical

33

metals such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and rare earth elements (REEs), which are crucial components in

34

clean energy technologies.1 Traditionally, mining ores has been the primary method for obtaining these

35

metals, yet this process carries significant environmental burdens.2,3 To address this growing demand, there

36

is a rising interest in recycling metals from waste, particularly electronic waste (E-waste), as a sustainable

37

alternative to ore mining.4,5 E-waste is among the fastest-growing waste streams globally and contains

38

diverse critical metals, even at concentrations higher than those found in high-grade ores.6 A key step in

39

metal recycling is the separation and recovery of leached metal ions, where these ions are selectively

40

isolated from mixed solutions and subsequently recovered as solid materials that can be reused in

41

manufacturing processes.7,8 Current practices for metal separation and recovery largely depend on

42

physicochemical methods, such as solvent extraction and electrodeposition, which, although effective, are

43

resource-intensive, require substantial amounts of chemicals, energy, and financial inputs, and generate

44

hazardous waste.9,10

45

In this regard, biometallurgy, an approach that leverages biosorption and biocatalysis to separate

46

and recover metals, offers a range of advantages of reduced energy consumption, lower chemical usage,

47

and minimal environmental impact, positioning it as a promising substitute for the physicochemical

48

methods.9,11–13 For instance, the protein lanmodulin (LanM) exhibits strong binding affinities for REE ions,

49

with a 1:2-3 stoichiometry, even in the presence of competing elements.14–17 This high selectivity has

50

enabled the successful application of LanM in recovering REEs from various sources, such as E-waste

51

leachate, lignite leachate, and geothermal brine, under ambient conditions and without the need for organic

52

solvents typically required in conventional solvent extraction-based REE separation.18,19

53

Ferritin is a protein that self-assembles into highly organized, hollow, spherical nanocages with a

54

diameter of approximately 10 nm.20 These nanocages comprise a porous protein shell formed by 24 identical

55

ferritin protein subunits and are ubiquitously used by organisms to sequester and store iron in their interior

56

cavity (Figure 1A).19,21,22 Beyond iron, previous in vitro studies have shown that ferritin nanocages can also

57

take up other metal ions.23,24 However, there has been limited investigation into ferritin's potential for

58

selective metal recovery from mixture solutions. Unlike LanM, which binds to REE ions at four specific

59

sites on the protein,14 the ferritin nanocage features an inner surface rich in acidic amino acid residues,

60

creating a dense cluster of negative charges that enables it to take up and sequester metal cations in the

61

cavity through electrostatic interactions.25 The nanocage’s open pores play a crucial role in determining its

62

affinity for different metal cations by controlling their influx and efflux.19,22 These unique capabilities allow

63

ferritin nanocages to bind metal cations at a much higher capacity and concentrate them within the cavity,

64

which could be potentially leveraged to facilitate metal ion recovery.

65

The objective of this study is to explore the use of ferritin nanocages to selectively separate and

66

recover metals from a synthetic mixture containing Co2+, Ni2+, and Li+, which are chosen for their co-

67

existence in lithium-ion batteries.26 We investigate the adsorption isotherms of these three metal ions within

68

ferritin nanocages and assess the nanocage’s ability to separate them one from another. To further enhance

69

metal recovery, we examine the feasibility of combining the nanocage's metal ion concentration capability

70

with precipitation reactions, aiming to integrate both separation and recovery into a single, streamlined

71

process. Through this approach, we seek to establish a proof of concept for using ferritin nanocages as a

72

sustainable solution for metal recovery from mixed-metal systems.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

91

AfFtn Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization

92

The successful synthesis of AfFtn was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, which showed a prominent

93

protein band around 20 kDa, consistent with its predicted size based on the amino acid sequence (Figure

94

S1A).19,22 Following heat treatment and salt precipitation, most of the contaminant cellular proteins were

95

removed. Further purification was achieved using SEC, where the majority of AfFtn eluted at 0.8 column

96

volume (CV) (Figure S1B&C), agreeing with the assembled, intact AfFtn nanocages, as reported in

97

previous work.22 Peaks containing AfFtn, eluting after the major 0.8 CV peak, correspond to either partially

98

assembled nanocage or AfFtn monomers, likely due to incomplete assembly of the protein.19 To further

99

verify the integrity of AfFtn nanocages from the 0.8 CV peak, DLS and TEM were performed. DLS analysis

100

revealed a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 10.7 nm (Figure 1B), closely matching the size of

101

assembled AfFtn nanocages, and TEM images (Figure 1C & Figure S2) further confirmed that the

102

nanocages showed intact assembly with well-defined spherical morphology.19,22,27

Metal Ion Adsorption by AfFtn Nanocages

117

The ability of AfFtn nanocages to adsorb metal cations was first evaluated using Co2+ ions by

118

simply mixing them with purified AfFtn nanocages. After overnight incubation, free and AfFtn-adsorbed

119

Co2+ were separated by passing the mixture through a desalting column packed with SEC gels. The gels

120

captured free metal ions while allowing the AfFtn nanocage-adsorbed metal ions to remain in the column

121

eluate, which was subsequently analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission

122

Spectrometry (ICP-OES). As shown in Figure 1D, a significant amount of Co2+ was detected in the eluate

123

when AfFtn was present, with concentrations increasing proportionally to AfFtn levels. In contrast,

124

negligible amounts of Co2+ were observed in the desalting column eluate when control proteins, lysozyme

125

and bovine serum albumin (BSA), were used, indicating minimal Co2+ adsorption by these proteins. This

126

outcome was expected for lysozyme, as it carries a positive net charge of approximately +5.2 at pH 8 (Figure
8

127

S3), leading to electrostatic repulsion between the protein and Co2+ ions. On the other hand, BSA, although

128

carrying a similar negative charge to the AfFtn protein (Figure S3), still exhibited negligible Co2+ in the

129

eluate. This significant difference suggests the critical role of AfFtn’s assembly in enhancing its adsorption

130

affinity for metal cations. As illustrated in Figure 1E, the assembled AfFtn nanocage displays a highly

131

concentrated cluster of negative charges on its inner surface, which could result in stronger electrostatic

132

interactions that foster efficient adsorption of complementarily charged Co2+ ions.32,33

133

We then assessed the adsorption isotherms of Co2+, Ni2+, and Li+ by AfFtn to determine whether

134

the nanocages exhibit selectivity for different metal ions. Figure 2A shows that Co2+ and Ni2+ were adsorbed

135

significantly more effectively by AfFtn than Li+, with all three ions fitting well to the Langmuir isotherm.

136

Li+ exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity (Qm) at 0.250 mmol/g AfFtn protein with a Langmuir

137

equilibrium constant (KL) of 2.81 mM-1. In contrast, Ni2+ had a Qm of 4.66 mmol/g protein and a KL of 2.27

138

mM-1, while Co2+ displayed the highest adsorption capacity, with a Qm of 14.5 mmol/g protein and a KL of

139

0.349 mM-1. Based on the molecular weight of AfFtn, each nanocage has the capacity to adsorb around 123

140

Li+, 7162 Co2+, and 2295 Ni2+ ions (see Text S3 in SI). Notably, the adsorption of Co2+ and Ni2+ reached

141

equilibrium rapidly within minutes (Figure 2B), a trend also observed in the adsorption of REEs onto LanM

142

proteins.18

143

Metal cation adsorption by ferritin can occur on either the nanocage’s outer or inner surface.25 Outer

144

surface adsorption primarily relies on forming coordination bonds at a limited number of specific binding

145

sites, while inner surface adsorption is largely driven by electrostatic attraction between the negatively

146

charged inner surface and the cations. This distinction results in significant differences in adsorption

147

stoichiometry: outer surface adsorption accommodates tens of metal cations per nanocage, whereas inner

148

surface adsorption can host hundreds to thousands of metal cations.25 Therefore, given the adsorption

149

capacities observed for Li+, Co2+, and Ni2+, we reason that these three metal cations are predominantly

150

adsorbed through electrostatic interactions with AfFtn’s inner surface, localizing within the nanocage’s

151

cavity. This explains the lower adsorption efficiency of Li+, as it carries only a single positive charge (+1).

152

Regarding Co2+ and Ni2+, although both have +2 charges, they exhibit notable differences in Qm and KL

values. The transport of ions in and out of assembled AfFtn nanocages occur through the open pores

154

between hexamers (Figure 1A), which are approximately 4.5 nm, much larger than the size of metal

155

cations,27 suggesting that size exclusion by the pores is unlikely to account for the observed difference in

156

Co2+ and Ni2+ adsorption. Instead, it is likely that additional factors, such as interactions between the side

157

chains of specific amino acids lining these pores,19,25 may influence the passage and eventual adsorption of

158

metal cations. As Co2+ and Ni2+ cations traverse the pores, they may encounter varying degrees of affinity

159

depending on the chemical structure of these side chains, potentially contributing to the differences in their

160

adsorption parameters. Further investigation into these interactions is required to fully understand their

161

exact roles.

174

Based on the differential adsorption isotherms of Li+, Co2+, and Ni2+, we next evaluated AfFtn

175

nanocages for selectively separating metal ions from mixtures. Equal concentrations of Li+ and Co2+ were

176

mixed with AfFtn nanocages, incubated overnight, and then passed through desalting columns, and metal

177

ion concentrations in the eluate were analyzed to determine the recovery rate for each species. As shown in

178

Figure 2C, at an initial concentration of 100 μM, the recovery rate of Co2+ in the eluate reached nearly 80%,

179

while Li+ recovery was negligible (< 1%). This suggests that the eluate contained predominantly Co2+ ions,

180

demonstrating that AfFtn nanocages selectively adsorbed Co2+ from the Li+ and Co2+ mixture, which

181

enabled effective separation of the two ions. As the initial metal ion concentration increased, the recovery

182

rate of Li+ remained at a consistently low level, while Co2+ recovery decreased, likely due to the AfFtn

183

nanocages reaching their adsorption capacity. It was also found that Li+ concentration in the initial mixture

184

had minimal impact on the recovery rate of Co2+. At a Co2+ initial concentration of 1 mM, increasing the

185

Li+ concentration did not significantly alter the recovery rate of Co2+ in the eluate (Figure 2D), further

186

confirming the preferential adsorption of Co2+ over Li+ by AfFtn nanocages. Similar results were also

187

observed for the Li+ and Ni2+ mixture, where Ni2+ dominated in the desalting column eluate (Figure 2E).

188

Furthermore, although Co2+ and Ni2+ showed different adsorption isotherm parameters for AfFtn nanocages,

189

the separation between these two ions was limited, as indicated by their similar recovery levels in the eluate

190

(Figure 2F). A slightly higher recovery rate of Ni2+ was observed at initial concentrations exceeding 0.5

191

mM, possibly due to the stronger affinity of Ni2+ (as suggested by its larger KL value) to AfFtn nanocages.

192
193

Selective Co2+ Recovery through AfFtn-Facilitated Precipitation

194

As discussed above, each AfFtn nanocage has the capacity to adsorb around 7000 Co2+ ions,

195

primarily through electrostatic interactions with its negatively charged inner surface, locating these ions

196

within the nanocage cavity. Assuming a uniform spatial distribution of Co2+ ions inside the cavity, we

197

estimate that the local concentration of Co2+ within the nanocage is equivalent to ~43 M (see Text S3 in SI),

198

which is hundreds of times higher than the bulk solution concentration. This highly concentrated Co2+ in

199

AfFtn nanocages presents an opportunity for direct, selective recovery of Co2+ from mixtures as solids via

200

simple precipitation reactions. To test this, we mixed an equal concentration of Co2+ and Li+ in an AfFtn

201

solution and added sodium bicarbonate to provide CO32- ions for Co2+ precipitation. The mixture pH was

202

buffered at 8.0. After overnight incubation and centrifugation, a purplish pellet formed at the bottom of the

203

tube, and the pellet size increased over time (Figure 3A). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the pellet

204

showed peaks matching the characteristic pattern of cobalt carbonate (Figure S4), suggesting its formation

205

through precipitation reactions between Co2+ and CO32-. In contrast, without AfFtn nanocages, no visible

206

precipitation was observed even after five days of incubation, highlighting the critical role of AfFtn in

207

facilitating Co2+ precipitation. Additionally, no precipitation occurred in the absence of NaHCO3.

bars are not visible as they are smaller than the symbol.

216

In parallel experiments, after removing the supernatant following centrifugation, any remaining

217

visible or invisible pellets were dissolved in diluted nitric acid and subjected to ICP-OES analysis to

218

quantify the amount of Co2+ and Li+ in the precipitates. Figure 3B shows that, in the presence of both AfFtn

219

and NaHCO3, the amount of Co2+ in the precipitates rapidly increased within the first two days, reaching

220

585 nmol. In comparison, without AfFtn, only 39 nmol Co2+ was recovered in the precipitates after five

221

days of incubation, 15 times lower than with AfFtn. When NaHCO3 was absent, Co2+ precipitation was

222

nearly zero. More notably, Li+ was negligible in the precipitates across all experimental conditions (Figure

223

3C). As AfFtn nanocages selectively adsorb Co2+ ions, they create locally concentrated hotspots of Co2+

224

within their cavities, facilitating the precipitation of Co2+ with CO32- ions. This selective precipitation allows

225

for the direct separation of Co2+ from the mixture as solids while simultaneously increasing the purity of

226

Li+ remaining in the solution, thereby enabling an efficient separation of Co2+ and Li+ ions.

227
228

Environmental Implications

229

This study pioneered the use of ferritin nanocages as efficient protein sorbents for the selective

230

separation and recovery of critical metals from mixtures. Compared to other biosorption approaches such

231

as LanM, ferritin leverages its unique property of concentrating adsorbed metal cations within its cavity,

232

enabling integrated metal separation and recovery as high-grade solid salts through simple, environmentally

233

friendly adsorption-precipitation processes under benign conditions. However, while AfFtn effectively

234

separates Co2+/Ni2+ from Li+, it exhibits limited separation between Co2+ and Ni2+. Future research should

235

focus on engineering its open pores (e.g., altering the pore size, incorporating amino acids with metal-

236

interacting side chains) to tune its affinity for different metals and achieve highly selective separation among

237

diverse metal ions. Moreover, an in-depth evaluation of the ferritin-based recovery approach using realistic

238

waste leachate is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of its efficiency under practical

239

conditions.

Protein Expression. The coding sequence of Archaeoglobus fulgidus ferritin (AfFtn) was obtained

39

from GenScript (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and transformed into BL-21(DE3) Competent Escherichia coli

40

(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) via heat shock following the suppler’s transformation protocol.

41

Single colonies were selected from LB agar plates containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin and inoculated in 10 mL

42

LB medium (100 μg/mL ampicillin), then cultured overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm (round per

43

minute). The overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in 200 mL fresh LB medium and grown at 37 °C,

44

shaking at 250 rpm for 2-2.5 hours until the OD600 reached 0.6-0.8. Cultures were then chilled on ice,

45

induced with 500 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and incubated overnight at 20°C.

46

Afterward, cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for two minutes at room temperature, and

47

the resulting pellets were frozen at -80°C until use.

48

Protein Purification. The purification of AfFtn nanocages was performed following a previously

49

reported protocol with modifications.1 Briefly, the collected E. coli cells were resuspended in 10 mL of pH

50

8.0 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 600 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor and sonicated on the ice using

51

a Branson Sonifier 550 in pulse mode (10% intensity), with 50 ms on and 50 ms off intervals. Each 30-

52

second sonication was followed by a 30-second pause until the solution became clear. The insoluble fraction

53

was then removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 minutes. The supernatant containing soluble

54

AfFtn was heated to 70°C for 20 minutes, followed by a second centrifuged at 12,000 × g, 4 °C for 20

55

minutes. The resulting supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 70%

56

saturation at 0 °C to precipitate AfFtn, which was then resuspended in pH 8.0 50 mM Tris-HCl with 600

57

mM NaCl. Any residual ammonium sulfate in the resuspended AfFtn solution was removed using PD-10

58

desalting columns. Assembled AfFtn nanocages and other proteins in the eluate were then separated on an

59

NGCTM Chromatography System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-400HR

60

column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA). The purified AfFtn nanocages were collected at the corresponding

61

Text S3. Metal Ion Adsorption by AfFtn Nanocages

65

Adsorption experiments were conducted in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on a Standard Analog

66

Shaker (VWR, USA) at 60 rpm and room temperature. For assessing adsorption capability, 50 - 200 μg/mL

67

of purified AfFtn nanocages was mixed with 0.25 mM Co2+ in 200 μL of Tris-NaCl buffer (50 mM Tris-

68

HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight. BSA and lysozyme were also evaluated under

69

identical conditions as controls. After incubation, 60 μL of the adsorption reaction solution was passed

70

through a micro bio-spin P-6 gel desalting column with a molecular weight cut-off of 6 kDa (Bio-Rad,

71

Hercules, CA) to remove unbound, free metal ions. The eluate containing protein-adsorbed metal ions was

72

diluted with DI water containing 1% nitric acid to create a 1500 μL sample solution for metal ion analysis

73

by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (Agilent 5000 ICP-OES, Agilent, Santa Clara,

74

CA). Absorbance wavelengths were set to 234.892 nm for Co2+, 231.604 nm for Ni2+, and 670.783 nm for

75

Li+.

76

To evaluate the adsorption isotherm, 100 μg/mL AfFtn nanocages were incubated overnight with

77

varying concentrations of individual metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, or Li+) in 200 μL of Tris-NaCl buffer (50 mM

78

Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Kinetic experiments were conducted by mixing 100 μg/mL AfFtn with

79

0.5 mM Co2+ or Ni2+ in a 2 mL Tris-NaCl buffer, with samples taken at intervals from 0 to 2 hours. At each

80

time point, 65 μL of the reaction solution was passed through to P-6 gel columns to immediately remove

81

unbound metal ions.

82

For selective separation and recovery experiments, combinations of two metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, or

83

Li+) were introduced into the reaction solution. After adsorption and desalting, the concentrations of each

84

AfFtn adsorbed metal ion in the eluate were measured using ICP-OES.

85

The average local concentration of adsorbed metal ions within the AfFtn cavity (Cf) was estimated

86

using the following equation, assuming a uniform distribution of all adsorbed metal ions within the cavity

87

of the AfFtn nanocages:

88

89

Where molAdsorbed metal ion is the molar quantity of AfFtn-adsorbed metal ions (mol); VAfFtn is the total

90

internal volume of AfFtn nanocages in the adsorption reaction solution (L); VICP-OES is the sample volume

91

prepared for ICP-OES analysis (L); CICP-OES is the metal ion concentration measured by ICP-OES (M);

92

mAfFtn is the mass of AfFtn in the reaction solution (g), calculated as the volume of reaction solution

93

multiplied by AfFtn’s final mass concentration (100 μg/mL); MAfFtn is the molecular weight of AfFtn

94

nanocage, calculated as 24 × MAfFtn monomer. 24 is number of AfFtn monomer per assembled AfFtn nanocage,

95

and MAfFtn monomer is the molecular weight of a single AfFtn monomer (20.51 kDa); NA is the Avogadro

96

constant (6.022 × 1023 mol-1); VmAfFtn is the internal volume of a single AfFtn nanocage (L), assuming AfFtn

97

to be a spherical structure with an 8 nm inner diameter.1

98
99

The average number of metal ions adsorbed by each AfFtn nanocage (Nmetal ion) was calculated using
the following equation:
𝑁*(+,- .%/ = 𝐶! × 𝑉*"!0+/ × 𝑁"

100
101

Where Cf is the average local concentration of adsorbed metal ions within the AfFtn cavity (M);

102

VmAfFtn is the internal volume of a single AfFtn nanocage (L); and NA is the Avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023

103

mol-1).

Text S4. Co2+ Recovery through Precipitation

105

The selective precipitation of Co2+ facilitated by AfFtn was assessed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge

106

tubes on a Standard Analog Shaker (VWR, USA) at 60 rpm and room temperature, using sodium

107

bicarbonate as the carbonate source. For each test, 100 μg/mL AfFtn, 66.7 mM NaHCO3, and 8 mM metal

108

ions (Co2+ and Li+) were mixed in 300 μL of Tris-NaCl buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0)

109

and incubated for varying time (0 - 5 days). Two control groups were included: one without AfFtn and

110

another without both AfFtn and NaHCO3. After each incubation period, the solutions were centrifuged at

111

20,000 × g for 2 minutes, and the supernatants were carefully removed. The resulting pellets were

112

Text S5. Protein Concentration Measurement

115

Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).

116

A protein ladder was prepared by diluting a BSA standard solution. To create the working reagent, reagents

117

A and B were combined in a 50:1 ratio. For the assay, 25 μL of each protein ladder and sample was added

118

to a 96-well plate, followed by 200 μL of the working reagent. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 30

119

minutes, and absorbance was measured at 562 nm using a BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Reader

120

(Agilent, CA) to quantify protein concentrations.

Text S6. SDS-PAGE Analysis

122

The 4× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer was prepared by mixing 4× Laemmli sample buffer Bio-

123

Rad, Hercules, CA) with 2-mercaptoethanol at a volume ratio of 9:1. This loading buffer was then combined

124

with protein samples at a 1:3 volume ratio and heated at 95 °C for 5 minutes. The samples were subsequently

125

loaded onto Any kD Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-free precast protein gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for

126

fractionation and visualized using Azure 300 imaging system (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA). Precision

127

Plus Protein™ All Blue Standard (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used as the molecular weight ladder for

128

SDS-PAGE analysis.

Text S7. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)

130

Sizing and polydispersity measurements of AfFtn nanocages were performed using a Beckman

131

Coulter Particle Size Analyzer at room temperature. The purified AaLS-13 nanocages were diluted to a

132

protein concentration of 500 μg/mL in a pH 8.0 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, passed

133

through a 0.22 µm low protein retention syringe filter, and immediately subjected to DLS analysis.

Text S8. Negative-Stain Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

135

Purified AfFtn nanocages were diluted to a concentration of 200 μg/mL in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer

136

(pH 8.0, with 300 mM NaCl) and applied onto copper grids (200 mesh, pure carbon film without Formvar,

137

PELCO). After a 2-minute incubation, excess AfFtn solution was wicked away using filter paper, and the

138

grid was rinsed in 0.22 μm-filtered DI water for 1 minute before wicking with filter paper. This rinsing step

139

was repeated three times to ensure proper cleaning. Subsequently, 20 μL of 2% uranyl acetate solution was

140

applied onto the grid and incubated for 2 minutes to stain AfFtn nanocages. After removing the excess stain

141

solution with filter paper, the grid was air-dried and stored at room temperature prior to imaging. TEM

142

images were acquired using a Hitachi H9500 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV at the

143

Nanoscale Fabrication and Characterization Facility (NFCF) at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt).

Text S9. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)

145

The pellet formed by incubating Co2+, Li+, and HCO3- with AfFtn was collected and dried in a

146

desiccator at room temperature. XRD data were acquired using a Bruker X-ray Diffraction System at the

147

Nanoscale NFCF at Pitt. Scans were performed over a 2θ range of 10° to 95°, and the collected diffraction

148

patterns were analyzed using DIFFRAC.EVA to identify peaks and compare with reference diffraction data.
