Abstract

26

Polyfluoroalkylether substances (ether PFAS) are widely detected in the environment, but

27

knowledge of their environmental fate through biological processes remains limited. This study

28

reports the microbial transformation of environmentally relevant ether PFAS and key microbial

29

groups involved in the anaerobic biotransformation process. The investigated ether PFAS include

30

mono- and dichlorinated ones such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (F53-B)

31

and 6,7-dichloroperfluoro-5-oxaheptanoic acid, as well as unsaturated ones such as sodium p-

32

perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS), Nafion Byproduct 1 (NBP1) and its analogues.

33

The presence of chlorine-substitution and unsaturated carbon facilitated the biotransformation

34

and defluorination of ether PFAS. For fully halogenated ether PFAS, biotransformation only

35

occurred under anaerobic conditions via dechlorination (reductive, eliminative, and hydrolytic),

36

hydrolytic O-dealkylation, and reductive defluorination, forming less fluorinated and shorter-

37

chain products. Strong evidence from community and pure culture experiments indicated the

38

involvement of cobalt-enzyme-dependent microorganisms, such as Sporomusa sphaeroides, in

39

the initial dechlorination step during the biotransformation of chlorinated ether PFAS.

40

Meanwhile, microorganisms independent of cobalt-enzymes, such as Desulfovibrio aminophilus,

41

were responsible for the biotransformation of non-chlorinated unsaturated ether PFAS (e.g.,

42

NBP1), especially for the hydrolytic O-dealkylation reaction. The findings provide significant

43

insights into the fate of ether PFAS in anaerobic environments and underscore the cooperation of

44

different microbial groups in a community to achieve further transformation and higher

45

defluorination.

Introduction

59

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) consist of a large group of persistent organic

60

pollutants due to the presence of many strong carbon–fluorine (C–F) bonds.1 Although these

61

anthropogenic organofluorines have been discharged into the environment for decades,

62

microorganisms have not evolved effective pathways to degrade them.2 These compounds,

63

especially the fully fluorinated and long-chain PFAS, are not only notoriously persistent but also

64

toxic,1, 3 accumulating in biological systems across plants, animals, and humans.4-8 As a result,

65

the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has established maximum contaminant

66

levels (MCLs) for six PFAS in drinking water.9 Besides five legacy perfluoroalkyl acids

67

(PFAAs), the list also includes hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt

68

(a.k.a. GenX) in the ether PFAS category.

69

Ether PFAS are manufactured for various applications and have recently gained

70

increasing attention.1, 10-13 The USEPA-regulated GenX has been used as an alternative to

71

PFOA.10 Other ether PFAS, such as 6:2 and 8:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2

72

and 8:2 Cl-PFESA, a.k.a. F-53B)12, 14 and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate

73

(OBS)15, 16 were developed as PFOS replacements. Some ether PFAS are used in fluoropolymer

74

manufacturing as building blocks, such as Nafion byproducts (NBPs).11, 17 Nafion is a

75

perfluoroether sulfonic acid polymer with essential applications in the chlor-alkali process,

76

analytical devices, energy storage and production.17-21 Although ether PFAS alternatives like

77

GenX and F-53B were initially invented with the expectation of being less bioaccumulative and

78

hence less toxic,13 studies reported their toxicities to human health and ecosystems via mode of

79

action similar to the legacy PFAS.22-28 The regulation of GenX and the increasingly documented

80

toxicities of other ether PFAS underscore the need for a more comprehensive understanding of

81

the environmental fate, transport, and degradation of ether PFAS in use, providing guidance for

82

risk assessment and mitigation.

83

Ether PFAS have been detected in diverse environmental matrices, including those

84

alternatives to PFOA/PFOS29-31 and NBPs involved in fluoropolymer manufacturing32-36,

85

suggesting their persistence in the environment. Although perfluoroalkyl ether acids are resistant

86

to environmental degradation (e.g., biological degradation and chemical oxidation by radicals),

87

polyfluoroalkyl ether acids have exhibited aerobic microbial transformation activities.37 Our

88

previous study revealed that the presence of ether groups (–O–) together with non-fluorinated

89

carbon (e.g., –CH2–) enhanced the biodegradability of polyfluoroalkyl ether acids. Other

90

microbially amenable moieties in PFAS compounds leading to significant transformation and

91

defluorination have also been identified, including Cl-substitutions for anaerobic defluorination

92

and C═C double bonds for both aerobic and anaerobic defluorination. The presence of those

93

moieties together with ether groups suggests the biotransformation potential of specific ether

94

PFAS, but studies on those structures are scarce. There are only reports on F-53B (6:2 and 8:2

95

Cl-PFESA) undergoing partial biotransformation via reductive dechlorination forming H-PFESA

96

without defluorination,38, 39 with the environmental fate of other ether PFAS with Cl-substitutions

97

and/or C═C bonds (e.g., OBS and NBPs) remaining unknown.

98

Thus, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the biotransformation potential and pathways

99

of environmentally relevant ether PFAS with Cl-substitutions and C═C bonds in anaerobic

100

microbial communities and identify responsible microbial groups. Five representative

101

chlorinated or unsaturated ether PFAS were selected, whose biotransformability was investigated

102

in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Biotransformation and defluorination pathways were

103

elucidated based on the parent compound decay and the formation of fluoride ion and

104

transformation products. Major biotransformation reactions and key microbial groups involved

105

were identified. These findings advance the understanding of the environmental fate of ether

106

PFAS, providing critical insights into risk assessment, source tracking, and the design of more

107

readily biodegradable alternatives.

In this study, we investigated four ether PFAS (Table 1), including two chlorinated ether PFAS

112

(i.e., one major component in F-53B, 6:2 Cl-PFESA and a dichlorinated perfluorocarboxylic

113

acid, Cl-E1 and Cl-E2) and three unsaturated ether PFAS (i.e., OBS, NBP1, and an NBP1

114

analogue, denoted “E1”, “E2”, and “E3”, respectively). Additionally, the available reference

115

compounds of identified plausible transformation products (TPs) of the parent compounds were

116

obtained (Table 1) for the structural confirmation and quantification of TPs.

Biotransformation of ether PFAS

126

Anaerobic biotransformation batch reactors were set up in 160-mL sealed serum bottles

127

according to a previous study,41 using fresh settled activated sludge (6700–6800 mg total

128

suspended solids/L) from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Each bottle contained 90

129

mL autoclaved basal medium including 100 μg/L vitamin B12 and other vitamins (the recipe was

130

the same as reported previously41) and 10 mL settled sludge, with a headspace of Ar/CO2 (75:25,

131

v/v). Ether PFAS was spiked into the culture (50 – 100 μM initial concentrations), and methanol

132

(~123 mM) was added as the electron donor and re-added bi-weekly. The pH was maintained at

133

7.4 ± 0.1. Biomass-free abiotic control and heat-inactivated biomass control were prepared using

134

the same medium, with autoclaved sludge filtrate (0.22 µm) and autoclaved sludge, respectively,

135

replacing the settled activated sludge. Sodium azide (~ 0.2 g/L) was added to these controls to

prevent cell growth and activity during incubation. All cultures, including biotransformation

137

groups and controls, were incubated in the dark at 34 °C without shaking. Triplicates were

138

included in all conditions. A sludge-only control was also set up to account for the sludge matrix

139

background for TP analysis. Aerobic biotransformation experiments were also set up using the

140

activated sludge taken from the same plant using the previously reported procedure (also see

141

Supplemental Methods in the SI).37

142

For all transformation groups (i.e., anaerobic, aerobic, and abiotic controls), 2-mL

143

samples were taken over a time course and centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 35 minutes. The

144

supernatant was collected to measure fluoride, the parent compound, and TPs. Cell pellets were

145

extracted with 1 mL methanol containing 0.1% NH4OH, and 13C-labeled PFOA was added as the

146

extraction surrogate to account for extraction recoveries. Cell samples were vortexed and

147

ultrasonicated for 30 minutes. The cell extract was then collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g,

148

4 °C for 35 minutes). Parent compounds and TPs detected in the cell extract represent the

149

biomass-associated fraction, either through passive adsorption or active cellular uptake. Both Cl-

150

E1 and E1 exhibited significant bioadsorption (> 20%), but not for the other compounds (Figure

151

S1). Here, the total concentration of the parent compounds and TPs, i.e., the sum of extracellular

152

and cell-associated concentrations, was presented in all figures and used to elucidate

153

biotransformation pathways.

itamin B12. The chlorinated ether PFAS, Cl-E2, and the non-chlorinated, unsaturated ether PFAS

160

E2 were spiked separately for comparison. Fluoride ions, parent compounds, and TPs were

161

analyzed over a time course of ~ 130 days.

162

The role of methanogens in the anaerobic biotransformation of Cl-E2

163

Methanogen inhibition experiments were conducted to examine the role of methanogens in the

164

biotransformation of Cl-E2 in the anaerobic microbial community. Methanogens in the anaerobic

165

community were inhibited by the addition of 0.5 mM 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), a known

166

inhibitor of methanogenesis.42 Biotransformation activities, in terms of fluoride formation, parent

167

compound degradation, and TP formation, were compared to the no-BES control. All conditions

168

were performed in triplicate.

169

Anaerobic biotransformation by pure cultures

170

Biotransformation of the ether PFAS was further investigated using two anaerobic pure cultures,

171

Sporomusa sphaeroides (DSM 2875) and Desulfovibrio aminophilus (DSM 12254), previously

172

shown to carry out anaerobic biotransformation of chlorinated PFAS.41 The two pure cultures

173

were obtained from the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH

174

(Braunschweig, Germany). Both cultures were grown in the basal medium used for the anaerobic

175

biotransformation experiments, supplemented with 10 mM sodium lactate as the electron donor.

176

For the sulfate-reducing D. aminophilus, 2 mM of sodium sulfate was also added. To assess the

177

biotransformation of Cl-E2 and E2, each culture was inoculated (10% v/v) into 45 mL of fresh

178

medium containing 50 µM of individual ether PFAS. Samples (2 mL) were periodically collected

179

during the incubation for fluoride, parent compound, and TP analyses. Cell densities were

180

determined by genomic DNA quantification (see Supplemental Methods in the SI).

The HQ30D Portable Multi Meter (HACH), coupled with an ion-selective electrode (ISE,

183

HACH), was utilized for fluoride ion (F–) measurement, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of

184

0.02 mg/L (~1 µM). The fluoride measurement accuracy within the same matrix was validated

185

using ion chromatography in our previous studies.41, 43 The defluorination degree (Def %) was

determined using the equation:

Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled to High-Resolution tandem

190

Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) Analysis

191

Ether PFAS were analyzed using a UHPLC-HRMS/MS system (Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher

192

Scientific, Waltham, MA). For the UHPLC, a 2-µL sample was loaded onto a Hypersil Gold

193

column (particle size 1.9 µm, 2.1×100 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The loaded sample was

194

eluted using a UHPLC mobile phase consisting of (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate in Milli-Q

195

water and (B) 10 mM ammonium acetate in HPLC grade methanol, at 300 µL/min with a linear

196

gradient: 95% A (0 – 1 min), 95–5% A (1 – 6 min), 5% A (6 – 8.75 min), and 95% A (8.75 – 12.5

197

min). For HRMS, negative electrospray ionization (ESI–) was used, with a full MS scan (m/z 70

198

– 1050) at a resolution of 70,000 @ m/z 200 and a data-dependent MS2 scan (dd-MS2) at a

199

resolution of 17,500 @ m/z 200, at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25. Peak areas for

200

parent compounds and TPs were quantified using TraceFinder 4.1 EFS and Freestyle 1.8

201

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Concentrations of parent compounds and TPs were determined using

202

matrix-matched calibration standard series.

204

Suspect screening was performed using TraceFinder 4.1 EFS against a custom-compiled list of

205

potential TPs from different anaerobic biotransformation pathways such as reductive,

206

eliminative, and hydrolytic dechlorination, reductive defluorination, HF elimination, O-

207

dealkylation, etc. Non-target screening was done using the “Expected and Unknown Met ID

208

(Metabolite Identification) Workflow” in Compound Discover 3.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

209

The criteria used for identifying plausible TPs were: (1) ≤ 5 ppm mass tolerance; (2) proper peak

210

shape with peak areas > 105; (3) isotopic pattern score > 70; (4) significant and discernible

211

formation trend over time; (5) no detection in abiotic, heat-inactivated, or sludge-only matrix

212

controls; and (6) exclusion of in-source fragments. TP structures were elucidated based on MS2

213

fragmentation profiles. Structures of TPs with available reference compounds were further

214

confirmed by comparing the retention time (RT), MS1/MS2 profiles between the TP and the

215

reference standard. Confidence levels of TPs were assigned according to widely adopted criteria

216

for general TP identification44 and PFAS-specific non-target analyses.45 The most plausible

217

biotransformation pathways were then proposed based on: (1) parent compound removal, (2)

218

fluoride formation trend, and (3) TP formation trend with confirmed formulas or structures.

219

These trends should be correlated stoichiometrically or qualitatively. In other words, the parent

220

compound decrease is followed by primary TP increase, the decrease of which leads to the

221

formation of secondary TPs. Stable intermediates should remain as the end products, which will

222

reach a plateau once their precursors are depleted. In addition, fluoride formation should be

223

stoichiometrically reasonable according to the parent compound removal and lead to the

224

formation of less-fluorinated TPs.

Results and Discussion

228

Anaerobic biotransformation and defluorination of Cl-E1 (F-53B major) and Cl-E2 by

229

activated sludge communities

230

Cl-E1 and Cl-E2 only exhibited substantial removal with F– formation in the sludge community

231

under anaerobic conditions (Figure 1A&C), whereas no transformation or defluorination was

232

observed under aerobic conditions or the abiotic controls (Figure S2A&B and Figure S3). This

233

is consistent with our previous findings that fully halogenated compounds like

234

chlorofluorocarboxylates lacking carbon-hydrogen bonds are unlikely biotransformed in aerobic

235

conditions.41

248
249

The major TP (TP496_Cl-E1) of Cl-E1 (see Figure S4 for the chromatogram and

250

MS1/MS2 spectra for TPs of Cl-E1) was from reductive dechlorination (Cl → H) (Figure 1B). In

251

a minor pathway, the terminal C–Cl bond underwent hydrolytic dechlorination, with Cl being

252

replaced with a hydroxyl group (–OH). The formed fluoroalcohol intermediate was unstable and

253

subject to spontaneous HF elimination and hydrolysis, forming an ether diacid, TP490_Cl-E1

254

(Figure S4B) as the minor TP. Only this hydrolytic dechlorination pathway led to two F– release

255

per one molecule of Cl-E1 transformed. Given a total F– formation of 17 µM by Day 128, the

256

portion of Cl-E1 underwent this defluorinating pathway was 8.5 µM. Thus, the remaining 37.5

257

µM out of the total removed Cl-E1 (46 µM) underwent the non-defluorinating reductive

258

dechlorination pathway. The same two pathways were also observed for Cl-terminal PFCAs.41

259

The presence of an ether group in Cl-E1 at the β-carbon, which is away from the Cl substitution,

260

did not affect the biotransformation pathways, as both occurred at the terminal position. In

261

addition, it is worth noting that the shorter RT of the two TPs (7.15 min and 5.87 min, compared

262

to 7.59 min for Cl-E1) suggests higher mobility than Cl-E1. The TPs tend to be released into

263

water bodies once formed from Cl-E1 in anaerobic environments (e.g., soil and sediments). The

264

higher mobility and unknown toxicities of those fluorinated TPs may cause additional

265

environmental concerns and underscore the need for the risk assessment of derived PFAS from

266

environmental transformation in addition to the parent PFAS.

267

Cl-E2, which has an additional Cl substitution at the adjacent carbon, exhibited three

268

times higher total defluorination (7%) than the monochlorinated Cl-E1. Besides the reductive

269

(hydrogenolysis, forming TP326_Cl-E2) and hydrolytic dechlorination (forming TP128_Cl-E2,

270

TP188_Cl-E2, and TP286_Cl-E2 from TP326_Cl-E2) (see Figure S5 for the chromatograph and

271

MS1/MS2 spectra of the identified TPs of Cl-E2), the two adjacent Cl substitutions of Cl-E2

272

enabled another type of reductive dechlorination, i.e., dichloroelimination,46 which was another

273

pathway leading to additional fluoride release (Figure 1E). The fluorovinyl ether moiety

274

(CF2=CF–O–) in TP290_Cl-E2, which was formed from dichloroelimination tends to be more

275

amenable to microbes. It facilitated the hydrolytic O-dealkylation, forming perfluorosuccinic

276

acid (TP188_Cl-E2 in Figure 1E) via spontaneous defluorination of the unstable fluoroalcohol

277

intermediate. It was structurally confirmed using the reference standard as shown in Figure S5F.

278

The hydrolytic O-dealkylation at a (fluoro)vinyl ether moiety (C=C–O–) was also observed in

279

aerobic conditions,37, 47 suggesting the involvement of certain hydrolases that are non-oxygen-

280

sensitive, and no oxygen is needed for this hydrolysis reaction. The fluorovinyl ether moiety also

281

promoted the reductive defluorination at the C=C bond, forming TP272_Cl-E2 (Figure 1E,

282

Figure S5E). Here, the role of the ether group was similar to the carboxyl group in the reductive

14

283

defluorination of unsaturated per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.48 It implies that the proximity

284

to electron-withdrawing groups, like ether and carboxyl groups, could promote reductive

285

defluorination at the C=C bond of unsaturated PFAS. TP272_Cl-E2 could be further transformed

286

via hydrolytic O-dealkylation followed by spontaneous defluorination, forming TP188_Cl-E2

287

(Figure 1E).

288

The portion of Cl-E2 undergoing each of the above-identified biotransformation pathway

289

was further calculated based on the quantification of parent compound removal, fluoride

290

formation, and the structurally confirmed TPs (i.e., TP128_Cl-E2 and TP188_Cl-E2). About 0.5

291

µM TP128_Cl-E2 was formed at the end (Figure 1C). This corresponded to 0.5 µM of

292

TP188_Cl-E2 produced via the hydrolytic dechlorination pathway of Cl-E2. Given the total

293

formation of ~ 2.5 µM TP188_Cl-E2, the remaining 2.0 µM was formed via the pathways

294

initiated by the eliminative or reductive (F→H) dehalogenation forming TP 272_Cl-E2 as the

295

intermediate (Figure 1E). Theoretically, five moles of F– could be released per mole of

296

TP188_Cl-E2 formed. The formed TP188_Cl-E2 (~ 2.5 µM) then corresponds to ~12.5 µM F–

297

from ~ 2.5 µM Cl-E2 reacted. The remaining F– (~ 20 µM) could then be attributed to the other

298

defluorinating route initiated by the hydrogenolytic reductive dechlorination followed by

299

hydrolytic dechlorination, resulting in TP286_Cl-E2 (Figure 1E). If the remaining 20 µM F– was

300

all from this route, it would correspond to 10 µM Cl-E2 reacted. Thus, Cl-E2 undergoing

301

defluorinating pathways was 12.5 µM, while the remaining reacted Cl-E2 (~40.5 µM) was

302

subject to the non-defluorinating reductive dechlorination pathway, forming the two stable end

303

products TP326(1)(2)_Cl-E2 and TP292_Cl-E2 (Figure 1E).

306

Anaerobic biotransformation and defluorination of unsaturated ether PFAS

307

All three unsaturated ether PFAS (E1 – 3) possess a fluorovinyl ether moiety, the same as that in

308

the dichloroelimination product of Cl-E2 (TP290_Cl-E2). They exhibited great biodegradability

309

with substantial defluorination under anaerobic conditions. E1 was defluorinated in both

310

biologically active and heat-inactivated samples in the anaerobic condition (Figure S6A), but

311

biological samples resulted in more parent compound decay and higher defluorination compared

312

to the abiotic controls (150 µM vs 81 µM F– release). No transformation was observed under

313

aerobic conditions (Figure S6B), suggesting the transformation under anaerobic conditions

314

might require oxygen-sensitive reducing molecules. E1 was likely transformed through reductive

315

defluorination and hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathways,37, 49 but no respective TPs were detected,

316

leaving the transformation pathway elusive. Given the unsaturated and branched structure of E1,

317

similar to observations for other unsaturated and branched PFAS structures,49 neutral

318

fluoroalkanes might be formed, which were not ionizable and thus undetectable by LC-

319

HRMS/MS.

320

For NBP1 and its analogue (E2 and E3), hydrolytic O-dealkylation at the fluorovinyl

321

ether moiety was one of the major biotransformation pathways (Figure 2 and 3), forming

322

TP340_E2 and TP174_E3 (Figure S7), respectively. TP174_E3 was structurally confirmed using

323

the reference standard. This is consistent with the hydrolytic O-dealkylation for the eliminative

324

dechlorination product of Cl-E2 (TP290_Cl-E2), which also contained the fluorovinyl ether

325

moiety. This reaction seemed not to be affected by the different head groups (i.e., sulfonic acid

326

vs. carboxylic acid). For E2 with two ether bonds, the hydrolytic O-dealkylation was also likely

327

to occur at the other ether bond next to the –CF3 branch (Figure 2C), forming the small end

328

product (TP174_E2). The slow formation of TP174_E2 and its low level suggest it a less

16

hydrolytic O-dealkylation of E3 substantially decreased after one week, resulting in incomplete

331

transformation of E3 (Figure 3A). This could be due to the toxicity of the small end product

332

TP174_E3, which was formed at a much higher level (~ 26 μM on day 7) than from E2 (~ 0.23

333

μM). The hydrolytic O-dealkylation at the fluorovinyl ether moiety of E2 and E3 also occurred

334

under aerobic conditions, indicating the insensitivity of oxygen of this enzymatic reaction

335

(Figure S9A & B).

Besides the hydrolytic O-dealkylation, two other pathways were identified in anaerobic

conditions. The TP of reductive defluorination in anaerobic conditions was detected for E3

358

(TP258_E3, Figure 3A and Figure S8). However, it was not detected for E2, probably due to the

359

longer and branched structure next to the fluorovinyl ether in E2, which caused a steric

360

hinderance of the enzyme binding. Additionally, hydrogenation of the C=C bond in E2 and E3

361

represented a minor anaerobic pathway, forming the hydrogenation products (TP444_E2 and

362

TP278_E3). Interestingly, in the abiotic controls under the anaerobic condition, E2 and E3

363

exhibited substantial removal and a considerable amount of fluoride formation but at much

364

slower rates than the biological samples (Figure S10). However, no TPs identified from the three

365

biotransformation pathways (i.e., hydrolytic O-dealkylation, reductive defluorination, and

366

hydrogenation) were detected in those abiotic controls. It indicates that (i) the three pathways

367

were microbially mediated contributing to the rapid defluorination of the parent compound; (ii)

368

there were unknown abiotic defluorination pathways for E2 and E3, which could only occur in

369

anaerobic but not aerobic conditions (Figure S9B & D).

370

We also performed a semi-quantitative calculation on how much E2 and E3 underwent

371

each pathway. We assumed that all fluoride formed in the aerobic biotransformation of E2

372

(Figure S9A) was from the hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathway, then every five F– ions released

373

would correspond to one molecule of TP340_E2 formed. Based on the total fluoride formation

374

from E2 under aerobic conditions at the end (~ 14 μM), there would be a maximum of 2.8 μM

375

TP340_E2 formed. The concentration of TP340_E2 was supposed to be proportional to the peak

376

area. Thus, the TP340_E2 formed in the anaerobic condition could be estimated to be 11 μM at

377

the maximum, which corresponds to a total of 55 μM F– formation (Figure 2C). The other

378

hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathway forming 0.23 μM TP174_E2 contributed to less than 1 μM F–

379

formation (3F– per TP174_E2, Figure 2C). Given the total of 147 μM F– formation from E2, the

380

remaining ~ 91 μM F– could be attributed to unknown biological and abiotic pathways.

381

Moreover, since the abiotic transformation and defluorination was much slower, it unlikely

382

contributed to the rapid removal of ~ 82 μM E2 and F– formation within 7 days. Instead, this

19

383

majority of E2 underwent some unidentified biodefluorinating pathways, with another 11 μM E2

384

undergoing the hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathway (Figure 2C). In comparison, the hydrolytic

385

O-dealkylation pathway was the dominant biotransformation pathway for E3. Among the 34 μM

386

reacted E3, over 80% underwent this route forming 28 μM the corresponding TP174_E3 within a

387

week, while other pathways, such as reductive defluorination, hydrogenation, and abiotic

388

defluorination, occurred more slowly over the time course of ~ 50 days (Figure 3A & B).

389
390

Cobalt-enzyme-dependent anaerobes played a crucial role in the transformation of

391

chlorinated ether PFAS

392

Enzymes known to catalyze hydrogenolytic reductive dechlorination (Cl→H) and

393

dichloroelimination (–2Cl) are usually those using corrinoids (cobalt-containing complexes) as

394

essential cofactors.46, 50, 51 Thus, we hypothesized that cobalt (Co) enzymes are involved in the

395

reductive and eliminative dechlorinating reactions of chlorinated ether PFAS, but not in the

396

transformation of unsaturated ether PFAS, which mainly involves hydrolytic O-dealkylation. To

397

test this hypothesis, we compared biotransformation of chlorinated ether PFAS (Cl-E2 as a

398

representative) and unsaturated ether PFAS (E2 as a representative) in the anaerobic community

399

with and without the addition of Co species, i.e., the free cobalt ion (Co2+) and the Co-complex

400

vitamin B12 (a corrinoid form with Co as the metal center). When Co was not provided, the

401

biotransformation of Cl-E2, regarding the parent compound removal and F– and TP formation,

402

was nearly completely inhibited, whereas E2 biotransformation remained unaffected compared

403

to the Co-added control (Figure 4). This result demonstrates that Co-enzyme-dependent

404

microbes played a major role in the first-step transformation of Cl-E2 via the different

405

dechlorination reactions. It could be certain Co enzymes that directly catalyzed Cl-E2

20

dechlorination. Or, given that some Co enzymes are required in essential metabolic processes

407

(e.g., methionine synthesis) by certain microbes,52, 53 Co deficiency could result in a cease of

408

microbial growth and activities in general, including Cl-E2 biotransformation that was carried

409

out by those microbes but may or may not be catalyzed by Co enzymes.

In contrast, E2 can be transformed by quite different microbial groups that are

419

independent of Co enzymes. One major biotransformation pathway of E2 was hydrolytic O-

420

dealkylation forming TP340_E2 (Figure 2C and Figure 4B), which is likely catalyzed by less

421

specific enzymes possessed by a broader spectrum of microbes. As the unsaturated TP290_Cl-E2

422

formed from dichloroelimination of Cl-E2 is structurally similar to E2, its further

423

biotransformation in the anaerobic community likely involved the same microbial groups for E2

424

biotransformation. Thus, Cl-E2 biotransformation may involve cooperative action among

425

different microbial groups, with Co-enzyme-dependent microbes catalyzing the primary

426

dechlorination reactions, followed by other microbes degrading the resulting unsaturated

intermediates.

biotransformation was investigated using an inhibition experiment, where methanogenesis was

433

inhibited by 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), a structural analogue of coenzyme M that

434

specifically inhibits methanogenesis. When methanogenesis was inhibited, Cl-E2 removal

435

decreased by 49% together with a 52 – 69% decrease in the formation of primary TPs from the

436

reductive (TP326) and eliminative (TP290) dechlorination routes, as well as the downstream end

437

products TP286 and TP188 (Figure S11). This indicates that methanogens were one significant

438

but not the only contributor to the primary transformation of Cl-E2. Other Co-enzyme-dependent

439

bacteria may also play a role.

We previously identified two anaerobic bacteria in an anaerobic microbial community

441

originating from the same source of activated sludge, i.e., Sporomusa sphaeroides and

442

Desulfovibrio aminophilus,41 which were able to transform chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE)

443

oligomer acids. Based on the genomic analysis, S. spharoides has the B12-dependent methionine

444

synthase (MetH), and thus is Co-enzyme dependent, while D. aminophilus has the B12-

445

independent methionine synthase (MetE) and could be independent of Co-enzymes in central

446

metabolism. Thus, we compared biotransformation activities of both bacteria for Cl-E2 and E2

447

to examine their roles in the different pathways. Interestingly, the two bacteria exhibited distinct

448

transformation activities for Cl-E2 and E2. S. sphaeroides was able to transform 80% of the

449

initial ~ 50 μM Cl-E2 over 100 days with 80 μM F– formation (avg. ~ 2F per Cl-E2

450

transformed) and the formation of TPs involved in the reductive and eliminative dechlorination

451

pathways (i.e., TP326, TP292, TP290, TP286, and TP188) (Figure 5A&B). In comparison, D.

452

aminophilus only exhibited minimal Cl-E2 removal (12%) and a slight formation of F– (9 μM)

453

with no substantial formation of TPs except for the first reductive dechlorination product TP326

454

(Figure 5A&B). The absence of TP290_Cl-E2 in D. aminophilus indicates a possible lack of

455

enzymes necessary for eliminative dechlorination. This is consistent with the transformation of

456

CTFE oligomer acids by D. aminophilus, where little eliminative dechlorination TPs were

457

formed.41 However, D. aminophilus showed substantial defluorination of CTFE dimer acid also

458

with two Cl substitutions via hydrolytic dechlorination. This emphasizes the structural specificity

459

of biotransformation, and ether groups in Cl-E2 might alter its biodegradability in D.

460

aminophilus. Notably, the total defluorination of Cl-E2 was three times higher in S. sphaeroides

461

than in the anaerobic mixed culture (23.3% vs. 6.9%) (Figure 5A and Figure 1C), despite the

462

lower cell density than the mixed culture (Figure S12). It could be attributed to the higher

463

formation of the defluorinating end products, TP188, TP128, and TP286 (Figure 5B and Figure

464

1D). This result also corroborates findings from the Co limitation and BES inhibition

465

experiments that Co-enzyme-dependent microbes played a crucial role in chlorinated ether PFAS

466

biotransformation.

472

On the other hand, as for the unsaturated ether E2, both bacteria showed complete parent

473

compound transformation and similar total defluorination (9 – 10%), with D. aminophilus having

474

a faster E2 removal and fluoride formation than S. sphaeroides (Figure 5C&D). E2 was

475

depleted in D. aminophilus within a week, while it took more than 25 days for S. sphaeroides.

476

This could be due to the higher optimal growth of D. aminophilus than S. sphaeroides (Figure
24

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-wfkg9-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9811-3828 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

S12). More interestingly, much higher levels of TP340_E2 and TP174_E2, the two TPs from the

478

hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathway, were formed in D. aminophilus, while the hydrogenation

479

product of E2 was only detected in S. sphaeroides. TP340_E2 was formed 2 – 3 times higher in

480

D. aminophilus than in the anaerobic mixed culture (Figure 2B), corresponding to 22 – 33 µM in

481

D. aminophilus based on the semi-quantification of TP340_E2 in the mixed culture (Figure 2C).

482

As five F– could be released per TP340_E2 molecule formed, all F– detected in D. aminophilus

483

(130 – 150 µM) could be attributed to this hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathway. The hydrolytic O-

484

dealkylation route forming TP174 (0.27 µM) again only contributed to less than 1 µM F–

485

formation like in the mixed culture. The rest of the removed E2 (~ 70 – 80 µM) by D.

486

aminophilus likely underwent non-defluorinating pathways, which remained elusive. Given the

487

ten times lower formation of TP340_E2 and the similar total F– formation in S. sphaeroides

488

compared to D. aminophilus (Figure 5C&D), S. sphaeroides might carry out other unknown

489

defluorinating pathways as those implied in the mixed culture (Figure 2C).

490

Collectively, Co-enzyme-dependent microbes, such as methanogens and S. sphaeroides,

491

made a major contribution to the biotransformation of chlorinated ether PFAS like Cl-E2 by

492

carrying out the primary transformation via dechlorination reactions, especially reductive and

493

eliminative dechlorination. They may also be able to continue to transform the unsaturated

494

intermediate formed from eliminative dechlorination, but given the slow kinetics their

495

contribution to the transformation of unsaturated ether PFAS was insignificant. Instead, Co-

496

enzyme-independent sulfate-reducing bacteria such as D. aminophilus excelled in rapidly

497

transforming unsaturated ether PFAS like E2 via the hydrolytic O-dealkylation pathway.

500

Given the use of ether PFAS in some essential applications and their widespread environmental

501

occurrence, this study provides critical insights into their environmental fate, especially for the

502

fully halogenated structures. First, biodegradability and biotransformation pathways are

503

structure-specific, meaning that the presence of certain functional moieties enables distinct

504

biological reactions. Also, the observed defluorination of the investigated ether PFAS was mostly

505

triggered by primary reactions occurring at non-C–F bonds. For example, fully halogenated ether

506

PFAS (with Cl- and F-substitutions) first underwent dechlorination reactions exclusively in

507

anaerobic conditions. Intermediates formed from hydrolytic and eliminative dechlorination could

508

further undergo spontaneous or biological defluorination. Increased biodegradability was

509

associated with a greater degree of Cl substitution, consistent with our previous findings for

510

other chlorinated PFAS without ether groups.41 Unsaturated fully fluorinated ether PFAS with

511

fluorovinyl ether moieties, such as NBP1 and analogues, may undergo rapid biotransformation in

512

both anaerobic and aerobic conditions via hydrolytic O-dealkylation. Anaerobic conditions

513

resulted in higher total defluorination, likely due to the involvement of additional anaerobic

514

defluorination pathways beyond hydrolytic O-dealkylation. Despite the presence of more

515

microbially amenable moieties, the investigated chlorinated and unsaturated ether PFAS were

516

still not completely defluorinated, leading to some signature end TPs such as shorter chain diacid

517

(ether) PFAS and H-substituted ether PFAS, which could be used for PFAS source-tracking and

518

suggest potential PFAS exposure profiles in the environment.

519

Second and more importantly, we demonstrate microbes involved in different structure-

520

specific biotransformation reactions. Specifically, co-enzyme-dependent anaerobes, including

521

methanogens and Sporomusa spp., played a crucial role in the primary dechlorination of

522

chlorinated ether PFAS, while the biotransformation of unsaturated ether PFAS was mainly

523

carried out by microbes independent of Co-enzymes, such as certain sulfate-reducing bacteria. It

524

highlights that the environmental biotransformation of certain PFAS structures could be a result

525

of multiple reactions in series collaboratively achieved by different microbes in a community.

526

Thus, PFAS biotransformation could be tuned by having the desired microbes in a defined

527

consortium to promote transformation routes that lead to higher defluorination and less toxic

528

products. It is worth noting that the observed PFAS biotransformation was cometabolic. As a

529

result, transformation rates are biomass-dependent. The occurrence and kinetics of the identified

530

biotransformation pathways in other environmental settings will depend on microbial community

531

composition, as well as the abundance and activity of the responsible taxa.

532

Overall, this study fills the knowledge gap of the environmental fate and

533

biotransformation of commonly used ether PFAS and advances the fundamental knowledge of

534

the responsible microbial groups and how they work together in different transformation

535

pathways. These findings provide important guidance for PFAS exposure and risk assessment, as

536

well as environmental source tracking. It also sheds light on the development of cost-effective

537

treatment systems involving biological processes by defined consortia and the design of more

538

environmentally biodegradable alternative PFAS.
