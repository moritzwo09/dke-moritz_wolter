Open dumping and burning of solid waste are widely practiced in underserved communities lacking access to solid waste
management facilities; however, the generation of microplastics from these sites has been overlooked. We report elevated
concentrations of microplastics (MPs) in soil of three solid waste open dump and burn sites: a single-family site in Tuttle,
Oklahoma, USA, and two community-wide sites in Crow Agency and Lodge Grass, Montana, USA. We extracted, quantified,
and characterized MPs from two soil depths (0-9 cm and 9-18 cm). The abundance of particles found at the three sites
(35,000 to 69,200 particles kg-1 soil) equals or exceeds reported concentrations from currently understood sources of MPs
including biosolids application and other agricultural practices. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared
(ATR-FTIR) identified polyethylene as the dominant polymer across all sites (46.2%-84.8%). We also detected rayon (≤11.5%),
polystyrene (up to 11.5%), polyethylene terephthalate (≤5.1), polyvinyl chloride (≤4.4%), polyester (≤3.1), and acrylic
(≤2.2%). Burned MPs accounted for 76.3 to 96.9% of the MPs found in both community wide dumping sites. These results
indicate that solid waste dumping and burning activities are a major source of thermally oxidized MPs for the surrounding
terrestrial environment with potential to negatively affect underserved communities.

Environmental Significance
Our work determined the abundance and vertical distribution of microplastics (MPs) in soil surrounding open dumping and burning
sites. This work unveils the abundance of MPs in the terrestrial environment around open dumpling and open burning sites near
underserved communities. Generation of MPs through open dumping and burning of solid waste is an issue concerning not only our
partner communities for this study in Oklahoma and Montana, but also globally, and has profound environmental implications for rural
and urban underserved communities globally.

Introduction
An estimated two billion people across the globe rely on open
dumping and burning to dispose of solid waste.1, 2 Though solid
waste burning may reduce waste volume, pathogen exposure,3
and undesirable odor, it lacks protective barriers and results in
refuse placed directly above the ground.4 Open dumping and
burning of solid waste are well-known sources of suspended
particulate matter, odorous compounds, or leachates among
other pollutants;3, 5 however, they are also an unexplored
source of terrestrial microplastics (MPs, plastic pieces with a
size between 1 µm and 5 mm6).
It is likely that open burning sites generate MPs due to the lack
of sufficient or consistent temperatures to incinerate plastic
waste, which represents between 6.4 and 13% of the solid
waste.1 Partially-combusted plastics generated from these
burning processes have more potential to generate MPs

relative to a non-oxidized plastics. Other types of oxidized MPs
(e.g., UV oxidized) have shown increased toxicity,7 sorption
capacity,8, 9 brittleness,10 or leaching capacity of additives 11-13
among other effects. This highlights the importance of
considering not only MP quantity and plastic type, but also the
MP chemistry.14, 15
Compared to aquatic ecosystems, the current understanding
of sources and levels of MP pollution in terrestrial ecosystems
is limited.16-19 Common sources of MPs in soils include
improper disposal of domestic and industrial waste, urban and
rural runoff, wet deposition, and biosolids.20, 21 However, even
less research has been conducted to understand the
abundance and type of MPs in soils due to open dumping and
burning of solid waste, which is a common waste disposal
practice in underserved rural communities.1, 3, 22-25 Few studies
have examined the occurrence of MPs in waste disposal sites,
and even fewer have considered the surrounding soils.26-28 So
far, these few studies agree on microplastic occurrence26, 27 in
a range of 50 to 1110 items kg-1. 28

About 18-29 million metric tons of plastic waste was burned in
2016.3, 29 In the US, some rural communities and isolated
Native American Tribes lack access to waste collection services
and management facilities and, as a result, must burn solid
waste in the open. Our work determined the abundance and
vertical distribution of MPs in soil surrounding open dumping
and burning sites at a single-family open burning site located
in Tuttle, Oklahoma (Tuttle burn site), and two Native
American community-wide sites in Crow Agency, Montana
(Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass dump site). We
identified the polymer type and functional chemistry of MPs
and trends in MPs abundance, polymer size, and surface
chemistry in relation to soil physiochemical characteristics,
depth, and site history and use.
This work revealed the abundance of MPs in the terrestrial
environment around open dumpling and open burning sites
near underserved communities, and through this work we
developed an FT-IR novel library of thermally-oxidized
consumer plastics which improves spectra correlations of
oxidized MPs commonly not detected with standard polymer
libraries.

Methods
2.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control
To reduce MP contamination during laboratory procedures, all
glassware was sonicated for 30 min in deionized (DI) water and
covered with aluminum foil until use. All procedures except for
elutriation and fluorescence microscopy were conducted in a
designated MP laboratory which had extra air filtration units
and regular rigorous cleaning of surfaces. All applicable
procedures were conducted in a laminar flow fume hood. Lab
coats made of 100% cotton were worn during all laboratory
procedures and synthetic clothing was avoided as much as
possible during sampling. A triplicate laboratory control was
conducted to detect lab-based contamination. To account for
base-level environmental MP contamination, background
samples were collected and run in triplicate. The background
for the Tuttle burn site was a field in nearby Stillwater, OK, and
the background for Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass
dump site was adjacent ranch land. No prior dumping or
burning was reported in any of these background sites.
2.2 Site Characterization and Sample Collection
Faculty of Little Big Horn Community College, Crow Agency, MT,
identified ‘Crow Agency burn site’ and ‘Lodge Grass dump site’,
which serve approximately 2,000 and 440 people, respectively.
Homeowners of Tuttle, OK, identified the burn site which serves
two people. Faculty and the homeowners described current
solid waste management practices. The approximate area of
each site was determined using Google Earth. The area of the
Tuttle burn site was approximately 50 m2. The areas of the Crow
Agency burn site and Lodge Grass dump site were
approximately 32,200 m2 and 36,000 m2, respectively (Table

S1). Aerial images and sampling coordinates are available in Fig.
S1 and Table S3. Partners from Little Big Horn Community
College reported that solid waste burning occurred regularly at
the Tuttle burn site and Crow Agency burn site, while primarily
dumping without burning occurred at Lodge Grass dump site.
The Tuttle burn site has been in use for about 30 years, while
Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass dump site began only
about 2 years from the sampling date.
The trash piles were not homogenous; thus, sites were divided
into quadrants (based on cardinal directions) to account for
variation in soil or MP characteristics. Samples were collected in
a randomized design, and samples were taken with two
different purposes: 1) we collected a bulk sample to ~18 cm in
depth using a shovel to determine texture and organic matter
content; and 2) we collected soil from ~0 to 9 and 9 to 18 cm
depths using a 2.54 cm diameter soil probe to evaluate MP size
and content distribution. Bulk and core samples were taken
from the same quadrants. Approximations in sample depth
were due to varied compaction levels across the sampling areas,
which at times physically limited the depth to which the probe
could be driven into the soil. Three sampling locations were
selected randomly within each quadrant of the pile. Subsamples
were collected from each location and combined to obtain
approximately ~1 kg of soil per composite sample, providing
four replicate soil samples per site. Samples were collected in
3.78 L new and clean plastic sealable bags to retain moisture
during transport and were refrigerated upon arrival at the
laboratory. The bulk samples were used for soil texture and
organic matter analyses and the 0-9 cm and 9-18 cm probe
samples were used for MP analyses.
2.3 Soil Characterization & Preparation
The bulk and probe samples were each passed through a 4.75
mm sieve for homogenization then dried at 50 °C overnight.
This drying temperature was chosen to prevent thermal
oxidization of MPs in samples. Bulk samples were sent to the
Oklahoma State University Soil, Water, Forage Analytical
Laboratory for texture analysis using the hydrometer
method.30 The organic matter content of bulk samples was
determined with a loss on ignition procedure.31 Texture and
organic matter characterization and area information are
provided in the supplementary information file (Table S1).

2.4 Microplastic Extraction
Microplastic extractions from the 0-9 cm and 9-18 cm soil
samples of each quadrant were performed in triplicate. For
each replicate, 10 g of dry soil was elutriated following the
procedure outlined in Forsythe et al32 to remove dense nonplastic material from the sample. Briefly, 10 g of dry soil was
sonicated in DI water to break up aggregates, then elutriated
in a column for 15 min using an upflow velocity of 1.3 cm s-1.
Particles with a lower settling velocity were captured in a 45
μm effluent collection sieve. Particles in the sieve were rinsed
into a glass beaker with water for transport to the designated

MPs laboratory. At the MPs laboratory, the water-particle
slurry was filtered through a 20 μm stainless steel mesh using
a glass filter unit. Particles retained on the mesh were rinsed
into a 250 mL glass Erlenmeyer flask with 150 mL of 7.5% w/w
NaOCl for digestion. Erlenmeyer flasks were secured on an
incubator shaker table at 300 rpm at 50°C for 24 h. After this,
digestate was filtered through a 20 μm stainless steel mesh
using a glass filter unit. Retained particles were thoroughly
rinsed with DI water, then rinsed into 15 mL falcon tubes using
5.1 M ZnCl2 (~693 g/L) for a density separation procedure.33
Falcon tubes were vortexed then centrifuged at ~12,300 ms-2
for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered onto a 20 μm stainless
steel mesh, and tubes were refilled with ZnCl2 and vortexed
until the pellet was resuspended and well-mixed. This
procedure was repeated until each falcon tube had been
centrifuged and the supernatant filtered three times. The
particles retained from the supernatant were rinsed
thoroughly with DI water, then rinsed onto a 13 mm diameter
2 μm pore size Al2O3 filter for MPs analyses using a glass
filtration unit.
2.5 Particle Quantification and Size Analysis
The particle quantification and size analyses were performed
according to Quiambao et al34 and details of the method are
available in the supplementary information. Briefly, extracted
particles were imaged with a stereomicroscope (AmScope 7X180X Trinocular Zoom Stereo Microscope) as initial visual
identification using Al2O3 filters. Each Al2O3 filter was placed in
a clean glass petri dish and dyed with ~30 μL of 2 μg Nile
Red/mL methanol solution for fluorescence microscopy
analyses. Particles were left to react with the dye for 10 min
then rinsed with 200 μL of ACS grade ethanol on a glass
filtration stack to remove excess dye. Filters were placed in a
Greiner 6-well plate and imaged with a fluorescence
microscope (Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi Mode Reader,
Agilent Technologies) using an RFP filter cube (excitation 531
nm/emission 593 nm). Gen5® software was used for imaging,
which allowed us to obtain a single stitched image of each
filter from a series of 4x magnification images (Table S6-S9).
The resolution limit of Cytation 5 cell Imaging at this
magnification is about 15 μm pixel-1. Each image was
preprocessed to reduce background fluorescence.
Microplastics were quantified by running the stitched image
through the MPVAT 2.0 macros using ImageJ.35 To avoid overquantification caused by the 15 μm pixel-1 limit of the Cytation,
particles smaller than 40 μm were excluded from
quantification and only the filter flow-through area was
considered. Stereomicroscope and fluorescence microscope
images are found in Table S6-S9.
2.6 Attenuated Total Reflectance - Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy Analyses of MPs
The functional chemistry of suspected MPs was determined
using Attenuated Total Reflectance - Fourier Transform
Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Thermo Nicolet iN10 MX)
which has a detection limit of 20 μm. One representative filter

from each triplicate was selected for ATR-FTIR analysis. Ten
percent of the suspected plastic particles identified during
fluorescence quantification were analyzed with μ ATR-FTIR; a
minimum of five particles were required for all filters
regardless of MP count and a maximum cap was set at 15
particles due to lengthy analysis time. In total, 59 particles
were examined from Tuttle burn site, 110 from Crow Agency
burn site, and 120 from Lodge Grass dump site. Each filter was
mounted on a gold mirror slide and a mosaic image of the
filter flow-through area was acquired with OMNIC Picta®
software to aid in the selection of particles. ATR-FTIR
measurements were collected with a cooled detector and
Germanium tip, 51 s collection time with 256 scans, spectral
range of 4000-675 cm-1 and a resolution of 8 cm-1. Aperture
size was adapted to fit each examined particle. The resulting
spectra were searched against the OMNIC Picta® stock
polymer libraries (HR Polymer Additives and Plasticizers,
Hummel Polymer Sample Library, Polymer Laminate Films, and
Synthetic Fibers by Microscope) and an in-house generated
library which included thermally oxidized plastic spectra
described below (Table S2). Thermally oxidized and UV aged
plastics were added to the library to improve the correlation of
the environmentally relevant MPs. Using the procedure by
Yang et al 36 a particle match >70% was automatically
considered plastic. A match between 60-70% required manual
visual comparison against the library polymer spectrum and
was interpreted based on similarities in absorption peaks. Any
match under 60% was not considered a plastic.
2.7 Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
Soil samples were prepared for Pyrolysis gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) following the
methodology explained in the section 2.3 Soil Characterization
and Preparation of this manuscript.32 Briefly, samples were
weighed out between 1 – 2 mg on an ultra-balance (EPE26
Precision Balance, Mettler Toledo). Analysis was conducted
with an EGA/PY-3030D pyrolysis unit (Frontier Labs, Koriyama,
Japan) attached to an Agilent 6890 GC/5975 MS system
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Quantification was performed
following the method of described by Forsythe et al32 and all
measured masses were normalized to the original sample
mass to give units of mg (plastics) to g (dry soil)-1.

Results and Discussion
3.1 Microplastics Occur in Open Dumping and Burning Sites
Particle Abundance: The community-wide open dumping and
burning sites contained a higher abundance of particles
compared to the single-family site (Fig. 1). The highest particle
abundance was detected in the Lodge Grass dump site with an
abundance ranging from 7,500 to 35,000 particles kg-1 in the 09 cm profile and from 5,000 to 69,200 particles kg-1 in the 9-18
cm profile (Fig. 1A). In the Crow Agency site, the particle
abundance ranged from 5,400 to 23,600 particles kg-1 in the 09 cm profile and 4,400 to 32,900 particles kg-1 in the 9-18 cm
profile (Fig. 1B). In the Tuttle burn site, the particle abundance

ranged from 900 to 12,300 in the 0-9 cm soil profile and from
1,200 to 19,500 particles kg-1 in the 9-18 cm soil profile (Fig.
1C).
The abundance of particles at the three sites is equivalent to or
far exceeds reported concentrations from currently
understood key sources of terrestrial MPs including biosolids
application and other agricultural practices.37, 38 For example,
biosolids can contain up to 14,000 items kg-1, and
concentrations higher than 5,190 MPs kg-1 soil have been
found in biosolids-applied agricultural fields.39, 40 A range from
900 to 40,800 items kg-1 soil was found in agricultural soils in
Yunnan Province, China – the abundance attributed in part to
plastic mulching.41 The high concentration of MPs detected at
the Tuttle burn site, Crow Agency burn site, and Lodge Grass
dump site evidenced that open dumping and burning of solid
waste are a key source of terrestrial MP pollution, especially in
the rural and underserved communities that must utilize the
practice.

Vertical Distribution of Particle Abundance and Particle Size:
The vertical distribution of particle abundance varied from site
to site (Fig. 1A-C). At all three sites, the highest MP count was
observed in the 9-18 cm soil depth. This may be the result of
MPs in the 0-9 cm depth being more susceptible to transport
off-site by runoff, or perhaps being transported through the
soil and accumulating in a lower depth by infiltration during
rain events. Simulated rainfall experiments have shown rainfall
intensity contributes to the migration of MPs deeper into the
soil profile, with MPs smaller than 1 mm especially prone to
deeper migration or accumulation in runoff compared to
larger MPs, and fibers and films being more mobile compared
to particles.42
The abundance and size of detected MPs varied between the
sampled depths at each site (Fig. 1A-F). At the Crow Agency
burn site, the 0-9 cm core contained 14,733 ± 6,319 particles
kg soil-1 compared to 17,175 ± 9,085 particles kg soil-1 in the 918cm core; the highest abundance found in this site was

Fig. 1. Abundance of particles (particles kg-1 soil) at each soil depth at Lodge Grass dump site (A), Crow Agency burn site (B), and Tuttle
burn site (C) and size distribution of all particles detected with Nile Red at Lodge Grass dump site (D), Crow Agency burn site (E), and
Tuttle burn site (F). All analyses were performed in analytical triplicate.
The quantity of particles detected in each replicate (analytical
replicate made from each composite) of all quadrants at Tuttle
burn site, Crow Agency burn site, and Lodge Grass dump site is
shown in Table S4, respectively. Quantification at background
sites and in lab controls is found in Table S5. Stereomicroscopy
and fluorescence microscopy for all sites, background, and lab
controls are shown in Table S6-S9. Microplastics were
detected at all background sites. A range of 1,500 to 4,000
particles kg-1 were detected at the Tuttle burn site background
location and 600 to 5,400 particles kg-1 at the Crow Agency
burn site and Lodge Grass dump site background location
(Table S5).

32,000 particles kg soil-1 (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the
Lodge Grass site contained 17,917 ± 10,405 particles kg soil-1 in
the 0-9 cm core compared to 24,000 ±17,364 particles kg soil-1
in the 9-18cm core; the highest abundance found in this site
was 69,200 particles kg soil-1 (Fig. 1B). Finally, in the Tuttle
burn site, the average abundance was 2,845 ± 3,224 particles
kg soil-1 found in the 0-9 cm core compared to 4,283 ± 5,189
particles kg soil-1 in the 9-18 cm core; the highest abundance
was 19,500 particles kg soil-1 (Fig. 1C). The large range of
particles quantified across these sites (900 - 69,200 particles kg
soil-1) indicate the heterogenicity of the abundance that can be
found in open dumping and burning sites. In terms of size, the
average size of particles found at Crow Agency site was 228.4 ±

Fig. 3. Stratification ratio of particle abundance (particle
concentration at 0-9 cm/particle concentration at 9- 18 cm) plotted
against percentage of clay in all quadrants of each site.
136.97 and 226.8 ± 117.30 µm for the 0-9 cm and 9-18 cm
cores, respectively (Fig. 1D). At the Lodge Grass site, the
average size was 224.3 ± 128.73 and 263.9 ± 187.11 µm for the
0-9 cm and 9-18 cm cores, respectively (Fig. 1E). Finally, the
Tuttle site contained particles with an average size of 224.5 ±
106.99 and 191.8 ± 84.72 µm (Fig. 1F). Similarly, the wide
range of particle size (126.4 – 1872. 8 µm) highlights the
heterogenicity of particle sizes found in these sites. We
recognize that a smaller size of particles is likely present in
these samples; however, the detection limit was restricted by
the high throughput of samples we analyzed.

We present differences between depths as a stratification
ratio (the ratio of particles found in the upper/lower profile)
and explore associations with clay content (Fig. 2). Overall, the
0-9 cm depth contained higher particle concentrations in soils
with less clay, which may be due to compaction in silty or
sandy soils preventing the transport of particles to lower
profiles. There are a number of factors which can contribute to
the migration and accumulation of MPs throughout a soil
profile.43 Corn roots have been found to contribute to the
upward migration of MPs in soil depth of 6-12 cm, while
earthworms have been shown to contribute to the transport
of MPs to deeper sediments.19, 44 Wet and dry cycling can also
contribute to the transport of MPs into the deeper soil
column, with more cycling corresponding to deeper migration
of MPs, and smaller MPs (<21 μm) showing the highest
mobility.45 While these factors are helpful to consider, there
are a number of additional variables which may affect the
transport of MPs including topography, soil texture, soil
compaction, and other soil metrics. Additionally, climatic
differences between sites such as annual rainfall, rainfall
intensity, and freeze-thaw cycling may contribute to
differences in MP transport throughout the soil profile at each
site.45
In our experiments, the soil texture of the Tuttle burn site was
sandy or sandy loam, while the soil sampled at Crow Agency
and Lodge Grass contained higher content of clay and may
have held more water-stable aggregates. Particularly, the soil
sampled in Crow Agency contained 2.5 times more clay than
the Tuttle soil. Clay is often positively associated with forming
aggregates and controlling pore architecture.46 In soils with

clay content such as Lodge Grass dump site, larger MPs could
potentially infiltrate deeper into the soil due to less-compact
characteristics and/or greater pore connectivity. Conversely,
only smaller particles could infiltrate the highly compact soil at
Tuttle burn site due to potentially decreased pore connectivity
and reduced water infiltration. Clay particles are highly
reactive and may affect the transport of MPs into lower
depths.47 The 9-18 cm profile of Crow Agency burn site
contained more MPs in three of the four quadrants; these clayrich soils may promote the accumulation of MPs at this depth
due to clay-MP interactions. There was little difference in soil
texture across the quadrants of Lodge Grass dump site and the
Tuttle burn site (single family). Thus, the variation in
stratification ratio should consider other variables alongside
texture including bulk density, aggregation, and water

considering these size fractions in future work will provide a
more holistic picture of MP and NP fate and transport.
3.2 Functional Chemistry Analysis of MP
A total of 58 of the 60 particles examined from Tuttle burn
site, 105 of 110 particles examined from Crow Agency burn
site, and 118 of 120 particles examined from Lodge Grass
dump site were confirmed as MPs by ATR-FTIR. Almost all MPs
identified at each site matched with burned or UV aged plastic
spectra. Examples of identified MPs from each site are shown
in Fig. 3 and all examined particles are shown in Tables S10S16 and Table S21.
Oxidation features or changes in the spectra can be observed
in several particles compared to the reference spectra (Fig. 3A-

Fig. 4 Microplastics found in the sites sampled. A) Relative abundance. B) Representative microplastics found in the sites of Tuttle OK (top to

(top to bottom): CABS-NW Shallow- 2, CABS-NW-Shallow-12 CABS-SE-Deep-4; and microplastics found in Lodge Grass: LG-SW-Deep- 12; LGSW-Shallow-13; LG-SW-Shallow-7. CABS: Crow Agency burn site; LG: Lodge Grass. N, S, W, E indicate cardinal directions
infiltration.
Few studies have examined the vertical distribution of
MPs through the terrestrial soil environment and have found
contrasting results.39, 48, 49 For example, the MP abundance
was slightly higher at 20 cm depth (mean particle
concentration = 53.2 items m-2) compared to 5 cm depth
(mean particle concentration = 34.6 items m-2), and smaller
average particle size was observed in the deeper profiles in
agricultural soils from China.48 A 3-times higher concentration
in the 0-10 cm profile compared to the 20-30 cm was
quantified in German agricultural fields.49 Microplastics
concentrations did not significantly vary between 0-10 cm and
10-30 cm soil depths of biosolids-applied fields in Spain.39
Similar to the variation observed between existing studies, we
found different trends in MP vertical distribution between
sites (Fig. 1). It is important to note that this study does not
examine MPs smaller than 20 μm nor nanoplastics (NPs);

F). The spectra were analyzed according to the correlation
charts described in Larkin et al.50 The functional chemistry of
LLDPE MPs indicated changes in the alkane C-H stretching
region (3000-2840 cm-1), sp3 C-H bend (~1410-1325 cm-1), C-O
(1125-1000 cm-1), and alkene sp2 C-H (650-1000 cm-1)
compared to the reference spectrum (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the
functional chemistry of PE shifted in the alkane C-H stretching
region (3000-2840 cm-1), sp3 C-H bend (~1410-1325 cm-1), C-O
(1125-1000 cm-1), and alkene sp2 C-H (1000-650 cm-1) and PP
MPs (Fig. 3A, 3B, and 3C). On the other hand, PS MPs show
different features in the aromatic C=C- stretching region (1675
– 1475 cm-1) region (Fig 3D-F). Our results indicate that in open
burning sites, MPs are exposed to conditions that modify their
functional chemistry which likely affects the reactivity and
mobility of those MPs in the environment.

Discrepancy in functional chemistry between the reference
spectra, weathered environmental, and thermally oxidized
microplastics likely leads to the misidentification or underidentification of microplastics by current spectral identification
tools. The current challenges of spectral identification highlight
the need to generate more environmentally relevant spectral
libraries that contain thermally aged polymers. However, more
information is needed regarding the occurrence of thermally
oxidized MPs in the environment.
High temperatures and UV radiation may be both defined as
oxidation processes; however, UV radiation is driven by
photochemical reactions (e.g., oxidation, reduction
decomposition, and polymerization).51 Particularly in thicker
plastics, these are diffusion dependent and occur in the first
500 to 900 µm layer of the plastic.52 Thermal oxidation, on the
other hand, can affect the surface and bulk within the same
process as a function of the temperature regardless the
thickness of the plastic. Our work evidenced that open
dumping and burning of solid wastes are a source of MPs with
a distinct functional chemical signature.
3.3 Thermally Oxidized MPs in Soils Nearby Open Burning Sites
Our results indicated that burned MPs occurred with more
frequency in all the sites across the different depths (Fig 4). In
the 0-9 cm depth, the prevalence of burned MPs ranged from
71.2% to 89.8% (Fig. 4A), while the prevalence burned MPs of
the 9-18 cm depth ranged from 82.1% to 93.8% across the
three sites (Fig. 4A). Lodge Grass, MT, was the site with the
highest abundance of burned MPs in the 0-9 cm range (89.8%),
while Tuttle, OK, was the site with highest relative abundance
in the 9-18cm range (93.8%). In all the sites, polyethylenebearing burned MPs (i.e., HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) showed the
highest abundance in both soil depths across all sites (34.6 –
76.3%). Finally, when considering the abundance of all plastics
regardless of their state of oxidation, polyethylene-bearing
MPs were the most abundant type in all depths and sites
(average 69.78% ± 14.61), followed by PP (8.27% ± 7.88), CV
(6.41% ± 4.29), and PS (5.62% ± 3.85).
The higher prevalence of PE compared to other polymers was
confirmed by py-GC/MS in all the sites sampled for total
depths reported (Crow Agency burn site at 5.97 ± 1.75 mg g-1,
Lodge Grass dump site at 4.99 ± 1.95 mg g-1, and Tuttle burn
site at 6.13 ± 2.59 mg g-1) (Fig. 5.). However, the actual
concentration of MPs found in these samples with py-GC/MS
may be underestimated it since the reference materials
(standards) available for making calibration curves and
quantifying MPs also exclude thermally and UV oxidized MPs.
Microplastics were found with less frequency at background
locations and lab controls than at the open dump and burn
sites. Only two MPs were detected from the representative lab
control sample: one polyethylene and one polypropylene,
likely from laboratory procedures in which plastic could not be
avoided. Compared to lab controls and background site
particles which were primarily white or clear fibers, a variety of
particle morphologies (rectangular, oval-shaped, round, etc.)
and colors (blue, pink, grey, etc.) were observed in the open

dump and burn site particles (Fig. 4B). Overall, these findings
coincide with the polymers most commonly used in household
and single-use plastic products that are often discarded in
municipal solid waste.53

Fig. 5. Soil plastic concentration (mg g-1) measured by pyGC/MS for the Crow Agency burn site, Lodge Grass dump site,
and Tuttle, Oklahoma burn site 0-9 and 9-18 cm samples.
Plastic types are indicated as polyethylene (PE), polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), nylon 6 (N6), nylon 66
(N66), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS).

Conclusions
The results of this work identify open dumping and burning of
solid wastes as a source of elevated concentrations of
terrestrial MPs. Burning practices result in the generation of
oxidized MPs which differ in abundance, size, and functional
chemistry from parent plastic waste solids. Microplastics with
a more oxidized functional chemistry will likely have different
effects on soil properties, plants, or biochemistry cycles than
the effects of non-thermally oxidized MP that have been
described.44, 54-57 The concentration of MPs found in single
family and community-wide sites (up to 69,200 particles kg-1
soil) equals or exceeds the concentration of MPs found at
other sites with high concentrations of MPs. The high
concentration of MPs identified at the single-family open
dumping and burning sites highlights the potential of small
sites to be as affected as larger sites. Generation of MPs
through open dumping and burning of solid waste is an issue
concerning not only our partner communities for this study in
Oklahoma and Montana, but also has profound global
environmental implications for rural and urban underserved
communities. Open dumping and burning of solid waste are
utilized by approximately a quarter of all humans on earth, and
more work is needed to understand the full scope and impact
of this practice on the surrounding environment.
