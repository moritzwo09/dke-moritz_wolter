Abstract
Brown carbon chromophores at environmental air-water interfaces often act as photosensitizers
that absorb sunlight and subsequently transfer energy to nearby molecules, initiating a wide variety
of chemical reactions. Despite their importance to understanding daytime chemistry at these airwater interfaces, little is known about the role of the solvation environment on the photophysical
properties of these photosensitizers. In this work, we present a joint experimental-theoretical study
of the vibrational and photophysical properties of microhydrated protonated and deprotonated
4-benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA), a key model system for environmental photosensitizers. We find
that for protonated 4-BBAH+∙(H2O)0-1, representing photosensitizers in very acidic conditions, a
single bright state dominates the UV-Vis spectrum between 280 and 400 nm. Comparing the
experimental UV-Vis spectra and quantum chemistry-predicted spectra of 4-BBA+∙(H2O)0-2, we
find that the degree of microhydration has little effect on the UV-Vis spectra or the orbitals of the
dominant feature. For deprotonated 4-BBA‒, representing photosensitizers in basic conditions,
quantum chemistry calculations predict that the UV-Vis spectra are ~3x weaker in intensity than
the brightest 4-BBAH+∙(H2O)0-1 features and were not observed experimentally. Quantum
chemistry calculations predict one dominant UV-Vis feature is present in the spectra of 4-BBA‒
∙(H2O)0-2, which exhibit minor shifts with degree of microhydration. While 4-BBA in bulk solution
over a range of pH values has relatively weak absorption within the solar actinic region, we show
that microhydrated 4-BBA has bright transitions within the actinic region. This indicates that the
complex structure of environmental air-water interfaces can shift the absorption maximum of
photosensitizers into the actinic region for enhanced absorption of sunlight and subsequent
enhancement of photosensitizer-driven reactions.

1. Introduction
Environmental air-water interfaces (e.g. surfaces of the sea and sea spray aerosols) host a variety
of characteristic photochemical interactions and reactions due to their unique structural and
chemical properties. The photochemistry at sea spray aerosol interfaces is particularly important
for developing next-generation atmospheric chemistry and climate models, as aerosol effects are
currently the largest source of uncertainty in these models.[1-4] Environmental air-water interfaces
are often covered with organic surfactants that may include light-absorbing compounds such as
brown carbon (BrC) species.[1, 5, 6] BrC, often derived from pollutants from fossil fuel
combustion, is a class of aromatic organic compounds that absorb strongly in the solar actinic
region (>290 nm) and efficiently form long-lived reactive triplet species.[6] Many BrC compounds
can act as photosensitizers, which are compounds that absorb sunlight to become electronically
excited and subsequently transfer energy to nearby molecules, inducing chemical processes such
as electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction.[7-13] These photosensitizing processes can start
radical chain reactions, including production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and
secondary organic aerosols (SOAs).[7-13]
Of recent interest are photosensitized reactions
involving organic surfactant species like fatty acids at
marine and sea spray aerosol interfaces to form highly
functionalized VOCs via radical chain reactions.[9,
13-15] Importantly, BrC photosensitizers are
competitive oxidants to OH• and singlet oxygen.
Given that the impact of aerosols remains the largest
source of uncertainty in atmospheric chemistry and
climate models,[1-4] it is imperative to develop a
molecular-level understanding of photosensitized
reaction dynamics and mechanisms at air-water
interfaces.
The photosensitizer species 4benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA, Fig. 1) has emerged as
a leading BrC model system, as it is a common moiety
in chromophoric dissolved organic matter
(CDOM).[9, 13, 16-21] Numerous studies have
reported the kinetics and product analyses of 4-BBA Fig. 1. Structures of neutral 4-BBA,
reacting with common environmental organic protonated 4-BBAH+, and deprotonated
species.[9, 13, 17-20] While the majority of studies 4-BBA‒.
have investigated the photophysical properties and
reactions of neutral 4-BBA, recent work from Karimova et al. has shown that the photophysical
properties and excited state character of 4-BBA vary significantly with protonation/deprotonation
driven by varying pH.[21] 4-BBA is expected to be in the deprotonated anionic form when found
in the sea surface microlayer (pH ~8; 4-BBA pKa ~3.4). Atmospheric aerosols, on the other hand,
tend to be acidic (pH ~2) and may lead to protonated forms of 4-BBA at the air-water interface.[2124]
There are numerous challenges involved in unraveling detailed mechanisms of
photosensitization by BrC species at air-water interfaces. Mechanistic studies of BrC
photosensitizing generally rely on a combination of numerous analytical experimental techniques
in concert with quantum chemistry calculations.[9, 13, 17-20] Static and time-resolved
spectroscopic methods have been used to probe changes in electronic state and chemical

composition during photosensitizing processes.[9, 13, 17-20] Reaction intermediates and products
are often measured via mass spectrometry techniques.[9, 13, 18] Quantum chemistry calculations
such as density functional theory (DFT) are commonly performed to aid assignment of spectra,
reveal reaction energetics, and confirm mechanisms.[13, 20, 21] Experimental probes of the
complex structure and makeup of environmental air-water interfaces, including interface-sensitive
spectroscopic methods, are challenging to interpret due to their broad features and the difficulty of
predicting spectra theoretically.[25, 26] Furthermore, air-water interfaces have unique properties
that change how molecules behave; in particular, acid-base chemistry has been shown to differ
substantially between air-water interfaces and in bulk.[23, 24, 27-29] Experimental and theoretical
studies of clusters have emerged as one of the leading models for investigating the unique
chemistry that occurs at air-water interfaces.[23, 30-33]
Despite the many insights obtained from quantum chemistry calculations in concert with
spectroscopic experiments, complex and dynamical interfacial environments pose a significant
challenge for constructing a small molecular cluster system that represents the key chemistry of a
photosensitizing reaction. Experimental techniques based on action spectroscopy of size-selected
clusters have long been viewed as a precise way to investigate of the dependence of electronic and
vibrational structure as a function of cluster size.[34-37] In these experiments, properties such as
system composition, charge state, and degree of hydration are known and precisely controlled. To
our knowledge, such experiments investigating the degree of hydration and charge state on the
vibrational and electronic structure of size-selected microhydrated photosensitizer clusters have
not been published. Herein we report a joint experimental-theoretical study of the vibrational and
electronic structure of protonated 4-BBAH+∙(H2O)0-2 and deprotonated 4-BBA‒∙(H2O)0-2. We
investigate the changes to the vibrational and electronic spectra with respect to molecular structure,
degree of microhydration, and protonation state via action spectroscopy and quantum chemical
calculations.

2. Methods
2.1. Experimental Methods
The WashU cryogenic ion photofragmentation mass spectrometer has been described in detail
elsewhere.[38] Briefly, ions were generated through electrospray ionization of 1 mM solutions of
4-BBA (Sigma-Aldrich, used without further purification) in 3:1 v:v acetonitrile:methanol. Trace
formic acid was added to the solution for formation of the protonated cation, while trace NaOH
was used to form the deprotonated anion. The ions were guided through three differentially
pumped stages uses RF-only hexapole ion guides into a three-dimensional quadrupole Paul trap
(Jordan TOF, Inc.) attached to a closed-cycle helium cryostat (Janis Research). Helium buffer gas
was introduced into the ion trap through a pulse valve (Parker Hannifin, Series 9 general valve)
and the ions were collisionally cooled to either 28 K or 170 K. Formation of “tagged” complexes
between parent ions and N2 (28 K) or water (170 K) within the trap were facilitated by trace
nitrogen and water in the buffer gas. A low amplitude RF pulse on resonance with the secular
frequency of the untagged parent ion was applied to the trap entrance electrode to remove these
ions from the trap. After sweeping, laser pulses were loosely focused into the trap through a KBr
window using a spherical mirror. All ions remaining after the laser interactions were extracted into

a reflectron time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Jordan TOF, Inc.). Ion signal was detected
with a dual-channel microchannel plate (MCP) detector.
IR action spectra were recorded using a tunable IR optical parametric oscillator/amplifier
(OPO/OPA) system (LaserVision). The OPO/OPA system was pumped by a Nd:YAG laser
(Continuum Surelite EX, 10 Hz, 7 ns pulse duration, 660 mJ per pulse) and the output was tunable
across the 2000-4500 cm-1 range, with pulse energies varying between 2 and 40 mJ per pulse. The
lower-frequency range (800-2200 cm-1, 0.1-1 mJ per pulse) was generated by difference frequency
mixing of the OPA signal and idler beams in an AgGaSe₂ crystal. The resolution of the system is
~3 cm-1. Action spectra were collected by recording the N2 or H2O photodissociation yield as a
function of the IR frequency. The reported spectra are averages of 10-20 scans, with data binned
at 1 cm-1 interval. The spectra were normalized by dividing by the laser power at each frequency
to account for variation in the laser power over the scanning range.
UV-Vis action spectra were recorded using the output of a tunable OPA (Light Conversion,
TOPAS Prime) pumped by a Ti:Sapphire oscillator/regenerative amplifier laser system (Coherent
Astrella, 800 nm, 1 kHz, 35 fs, 3.6 W). The output bandwidth of the UV-Vis pulses is ~5 nm across
the tuning range used in these studies (285-490 nm). The pulse energies were kept at ~3 μJ/pulse
at each wavelength using a half-waveplate and polarizer. Action spectra were collected by
recording the photofragmentation yield at intervals of 5-10 nm. The photofragmentation signal
was averaged over 128 trapping cycles, with 10 total averages collected at each wavelength.
2.2. Computational Methods
A conformer search for each of the six clusters was performed in Crest,[39] where all structures
with a relative energy within 1 eV of the lowest-lying cluster were selected for secondary
screening. These lowest-lying clusters underwent geometry optimization with the B3LYP density
functional,[40-43] STO-6G basis set,[44] and D3(BJ) dispersion correction.[45] The 10 lowestlying structures from each cluster in this secondary screening were then optimized a second time
with the same density functional and dispersion correction and the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.[46, 47]
Harmonic frequency calculations were performed at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVDZ level of
theory to confirm that all structures are geometric minima, obtain zero-point energies (ZPE), and
obtain vibrational frequencies. Zero-point energy (ZPE) was included in calculations of the
relative energy to identify the lowest-lying conformer.
Vibrational frequencies of
4-BBAH+·(H2O)n were scaled by 0.956 to bring the carboxylic acid OH stretch of 4-BBAH+ into
agreement with experiment. Vibrational frequencies of 4-BBA‒·(H2O)n were scaled by 0.962 to
bring the strongest calculated CH stretch of 4-BBA‒ into agreement with the strongest measured
CH stretch. To obtain the UV-Vis spectra, vertical excited state calculations were performed at the
minimum geometries for the lowest-lying isomers of each cluster with time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT), employing the same functional, basis set, and dispersion correction
as used in the ground state calculations. UV-Vis energies of 4-BBAH+·(H2O)n were all scaled
0.925 to bring the most intense feature of 4-BBAH+ into agreement with experiment. Natural
transition orbitals (NTOs) were computed and visualized in IQMol[48] with an isovalue of 0.02
Å-3 to represent the changes in electronic density during an electronic transition.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Protonated 4-BBA Cation
3.1.1. Structures and Infrared Spectra
Vibrational action spectra of 4-BBAH+·N2 and
4-BBAH+·H2O are presented in Figs. 2a and
2b, respectively, along with the calculated
harmonic spectra for the minimum-energy
structures (shown inset). For the bare 4BBAH+ species, the excess proton can bind to
either the bridging ketone carbonyl or the
carboxylic acid carbonyl. Our calculations
predict the protonated ketone species to be
4731 cm-1 lower in energy compared to
protonation at the carboxylic acid group.
Protonation of the ketone group gives rise to
two intense OH stretch infrared (IR) transitions
from the protonated OH+ ketone group and
from the OH stretch of the carboxylic acid
group. The calculations predict these two OH
stretch transitions to be nearly isoenergetic.
The experimental vibrational spectrum also
displays two strong high-frequency transitions,
but with a larger separation than predicted. The

accurately capture the observed experimental splitting between the ketone and carboxylic acid OH
stretches (Fig. S1). Furthermore, the experimental fingerprint region (1000-1900 cm-1) is more
consistent with the predicted spectrum for protonation at the ketone group compared to at the
carboxylic acid group (Fig. S2).
In the one-water cluster, the water molecule can bind either at the protonated ketone site
or at the carboxylic acid group via H-bonding interactions. The experimental spectrum (Fig. 2b)
exhibits a transition at 3573 cm-1, which is the same frequency assigned to the carboxylic acid
OH stretch in the bare cation. In the one-water cluster, there is no feature corresponding to a
protonated ketone OH+ stretch at 3403 cm-1, as seen in the bare cation. The lack of the ketone

OH+ stretch is consistent with the water binding to the
OH+ ketone group. Additionally, two new transitions
appear at 3633 cm-1 and 3720 cm-1, which we assign
as the symmetric and antisymmetric stretches of the
bound water, respectively. The appearance of a
symmetric and antisymmetric OH stretch normal
mode pair indicates that the water molecule accepts a
single H-bond from the ketone OH+ group and
donates no H-bonds. In this arrangement, the ketone
OH+ stretch would be expected to show a significant
red shift due to formation of a strong ionic H-bond
with the water molecule.[49, 50] Indeed, a highly red
shifted and broad feature (2500-3200 cm-1) is
observed with highest intensity near 2640 cm-1,
consistent with strong and highly anharmonic Hbonded OH stretch transitions.[49, 50] Note that this
lower-frequency region was collected at full laser
power and likely results from multiphoton absorption
due to the large binding energy (~3000 cm-1) of water

ion signal of this species could not be generated for
spectroscopic characterization. Our theoretical
calculations find that the second water molecule binds to the carboxylic acid OH group, accepting
a single H-bond. One OH group of the water molecule points towards the carboxylic acid carbonyl,
but the H-bond interaction is weak, evidenced by a small angle of 118° between OH and carbonyl.
This weak interaction enables the symmetric and antisymmetric stretch character of the bound
water molecule to be retained. The calculations predict a small difference between the two
respective symmetric stretches (41 cm-1, unscaled) and nearly isoenergetic antisymmetric stretches
(6 cm-1, unscaled). Based on our observations of the single-water cluster, we predict that if ion
signal were sufficiently strong to measure the two-water cluster, we predict that the H-bonded
carboxylic acid OH stretch group would significantly red shift and broaden like the H-bonded
ketone OH+ group in the single water complex. This prediction is supported by the theoretical
calculations showing that the carboxylic acid OH stretch in the two-water cluster is 574 cm-1 red
shifted (unscaled) from the one-water cluster.
There are several low-lying conformers (< 300 cm-1 difference in relative energy) for each
of the protonated cation species that involve internal rotations of the 4-BBAH+ COH+ and COOH
groups. The IR and electronic spectra of these conformers are essentially identical to those for the
minimum-energy structures and are likely to be indistinguishable experimentally (Figs. S3-S11).

3.1.2. UV-Vis Spectra and Electronic Transitions
Low-resolution UV-Vis spectra of 4-BBAH+ and
4-BBAH+·H2O are presented in Fig. 3a, with
calculated spectra given in Fig. 3b. A single strong
transition is observed in both species. As stated
above, sufficient ion signal of 4-BBAH+·(H2O)2
could not be generated for spectroscopic
characterization. The UV-Vis spectra of 4-BBAH+
were measured with two photofragmentation
methods: photofragmentation of the bare 4-BBAH+
as well as photofragmentation of 4-BBAH+ tagged
with N2. The UV-Vis spectrum collected from the
bare 4-BBAH+ photofragmentation gives a
maximum absorption center at ~27500 cm-1 (~364
nm), see Fig. S12. The UV-Vis spectrum collected
from the N2-tagged 4-BBAH+ exhibits a small blue
shift of 300 cm-1 in the maximum peak (27800 cm-1,

each species.
Interestingly, this shows that the absorption
maximum in the UV-Vis spectrum of the N2-tagged
4-BBAH+ is very close to that of the 4-BBAH+·H2O, indicating a similar solvatochromic shift
from loss of N2 vs. H2O.
The calculated UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 3b are in good agreement with experiment, as they
correctly predict one intense transition for both 4-BBAH+ and 4-BBAH+·H2O. Furthermore, the
calculations predict a 793 cm-1 blue shift (unscaled) between the absorption maxima of 4-BBAH+
and 4-BBAH+·H2O, compared to a blue shift of ~300 cm-1 in the experiment. The calculated UVVis spectrum of the 4-BBAH+·(H2O)2 minimum-energy structure is also presented in Fig. 3b. The
calculated spectrum is quite similar to both 4-BBAH+ and 4-BBAH+·H2O, with the absorption
maximum predicted to fall in-between those of 4-BBAH+ and 4-BBAH+∙H2O. Natural transition
orbitals (NTOs) of each species’ most intense UV-Vis transition, the S4 state, are shown in Fig. 4.
The highest occupied NTO (HONTO) and lowest unoccupied NTO (LUNTO) represent the initial
and final orbitals in the electronic transition. The HONTOs for each species look very similar, as
well as the LUNTOs, indicating that the complexation of 1-2 water molecules plays only a minor
role in the electronic structure of the bright state S4. The NTOs indicate that the S4 states are
primarily characterized by a ππ* transition. In the water-complexed clusters, some electron density
can be seen on the water molecules bound to the protonated ketone, though the majority of electron
density is on the 4-BBAH+ species.
Each of the 4-BBAH+·(H2O)n species are predicted to have weaker higher-energy
transitions that fall within the 31000-34000 cm-1 (294-323 nm) range. Although absorption signal
may be present in this region experimentally, the signals are too weak to distinguish above the
baseline noise. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the NTOs for these higher-energy transitions
correspond primarily to ππ* transitions (Fig. S14).

Overall, the UV-Vis spectra of microhydrated 4-BBAH+ display absorption maxima in the
350-375 nm range, which is quite shifted compared to 4-BBA in bulk water at low pH (~260
nm).[21] We note that 4-BBA in bulk water at low pH also exhibits a weak, broad shoulder at ~330
nm. For a number of reasons, it is unclear whether we can make a one-to-one comparison between
the strongest features in the bulk vs. cluster spectra. Due to experimental limitations, we are unable
to scan the UV-Vis region to higher energies where microsolvated 4-BBAH+ may exhibit
maximum absorption. We turn to theoretical calculations to assess whether intense features arise
at higher excitation energies, finding that within
the studied range, up to 235 nm, there are no
stronger peaks. Furthermore, we note that, to our
knowledge, the photophysical properties of
microsolvated 4-BBAH+ have not been studied,
as 4-BBAH+ may not be stable in bulk solution.
The pKa of the carboxylic acid OH in 4-BBAH+
is 3.4.[21] The ketone OH+ pKa of 4-BBAH is
likely much smaller, though to our knowledge, a
literature value is not available. This means that
4-BBAH+ will likely exist only in highly acidic,
undersolvated conditions that can occur at airwater interfaces. Numerous studies have found
that the unique conditions of the air-water
interface can result in stabilization of intact
strong acids such as HCl and HNO3.[23, 24, 2729]
Interestingly, we observe minimal
perturbation by one and two water molecules on
the UV-Vis spectrum of bare 4-BBAH+,
indicating that a much larger hydration shell is
needed to shift the electronic transitions closer to
the bulk solution spectrum, which will likely
cause the protonated ketone to deprotonate and
form neutral 4-BBA and H3O+. Future studies

3.2 Deprotonated 4-BBA Anion
3.2.1 Structures and IR Spectra

Vibrational action spectra of deprotonated 4-BBA‒
·(H2O)0-2 clusters are presented in Fig. 5 along with
scaled harmonic spectra of the minimum-energy
structures. For bare 4-BBA‒, the vibrational spectrum
in the high-frequency region only displays relatively
weak CH stretching modes, as expected for a
deprotonated species without strong OH oscillators
(Fig. 5a). The lower-frequency fingerprint region is
presented in Fig. S15 showing the ketone and
carboxylate group CO stretching modes, confirming
the identity of the 4-BBA‒ anion.
The vibrational spectrum of 4-BBA‒·H2O
shows a broad OH stretching region spanning 31003500 cm-1 that is consistent with the calculated
minimum-energy structure where the water molecule
forms two H-bonds with the carboxylate in a bridging
configuration (Fig. 5b). The harmonic calculations

Turning to the vibrational spectrum of 4-BBA‒
·(H2O)2 (Fig. 5c), the OH stretch region is even broader than the one-water complex, spanning
3000-3500 cm-1. The calculated minimum-energy structure predicts that both water molecules bind
to the carboxylate group. The binding of the two water molecules at the carboxylate group is
consistent with the recent calculations from Karimova et al.[21] on 4-BBA‒ clustered with 8 and
30 water molecules which showed extended water networks forming around the carboxylate group.
One water is in a double donor (DD) arrangement, donating a H-bond each to the carboxylate
group and to the other water molecule. The other water molecule is in an acceptor-donor (AD)
configuration, donating a H-bond to the carboxylate group and accepting a H-bond from the other
water, leaving a free OH. The weaker high-frequency feature at 3650 cm-1 is consistent with the
predicted OH stretch of the double donor water molecule towards the other water molecule,

3.2.2 UV-Vis Spectra and Electronic Transitions
Spectral scans in the 20000-36000 cm-1 (280-500 nm) range for 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 clusters are
shown in Fig. 6a. No discernable transitions above baseline noise were observed for any of the
three species experimentally. Electron photodetachment, which would result in depletion of the
parent anion due to formation of the corresponding neutral, was not observed. Turning to the
calculated UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 6b, we find that each cluster 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 exhibits one
dominant feature in the 280-500 nm range. However, we note that these features are ~3x less
intense than the most intense features in the predicted 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 clusters. We note that
we theoretically predict less intense features in the 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 UV-Vis spectra at ~300320 nm (Fig. 3b) which have similar intensities as those predicted for 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2. Because
these lower intensity features in 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 could not be observed experimentally, it is
likely that the intensities of 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 are similarly too low for experimental measurement.
While there is an experimental increase in photodissociation signal near the end of the tuning range
(~285 nm), it is not definitively above the noise level of the measurement. We thus rely on
theoretical calculations for our analysis.
Fig. 6b shows the UV-Vis spectra of 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 predicted theoretically. We observe
that the bare 4-BBA‒ exhibits a strong transition at ~320 nm. Upon complexation with one water,
this peak shifts to ~310 nm and with a second water molecule, shifts again to ~300 nm. In contrast
to 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2, we observe systematic blue shifting of the dominant feature. A lack of
systematic shift in the 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 is likely due to the fact that each water binds to a
different functional group site (carboxylic acid and protonated ketone), while in 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2,
both the one- and two-water clusters bind to the
carboxylate.
The NTOs of the dominant UV-Vis
transitions of 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 are shown in Fig.
7. These NTOs represent the electronic orbitals
for the S17 state of the bare anion, S14 state of the
one-water, and S9 state of the two-water. This
represents another difference between the 4-BBA‒
·(H2O)0-2 and 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 UV-Vis spectra:
all the intense features in the 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2
correspond to the same electronic state, S4.
However, despite the differences in state ordering,
the NTOs of 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 show many similar
characteristics.
We assign these NTOs as
primarily ππ* transitions. Karimova et al. found
that 4-BBA‒·(H2O)8 exhibits a bright ππ*
transition at ~275 nm with similar NTO orbital
characteristics as we found for 4-BBA‒·(H2O)2. Fig. 7. NTOs corresponding to the strongest

hypothesize that adding water to the solvation shell around 4-BBA‒·(H2O)n systematically blue
shifts the dominant ππ* feature toward the high-pH solution-phase limit of 264 nm. While the
UV-Vis absorption peaks of microhydrated 4-BBA‒ are predicted to be fairly weak, they appear in
the solar actinic region where even weakly absorbing chromophores can significantly drive
photochemical reactions.[54, 55]
Finally, we assessed the role of protonation/deprotonation on the shift of the UV-Vis
spectrum by comparing the calculated UV-Vis spectra of microhydrated 4-BBAH+ and 4-BBA‒
(Figs. 3b, 6b) with the neutral 4-BBA (Fig. S16). Due to the nature of our action spectroscopy
experiments, neutral species cannot be mass selected for study. We find that all three clusters (0-2
water molecules, H-bound to carboxylic acid) exhibit the dominant UV-Vis absorption feature at
256 nm (unscaled). This is close to the experimental value of 4-BBA in bulk water, with an
absorption peak of 260 nm.[21] Karimova et al. found a maximum UV-Vis absorption feature of
4-BBA·(H2O)8 at 265 nm with similar computational methods as the ones used here.[21] Thus,
our value of 256 nm in 4-BBA·(H2O)0-2 is blue shifted relative to the larger clusters and
experimental values of 4-BBA in bulk solution. This indicates that the trend seen for
microhydrated 4-BBA‒, where the addition of water blue shifts the dominant UV-Vis peak away
from the actinic region, is not observed for systematic hydration of neutral 4-BBA. We also note
that the dominant UV-Vis peaks of 4-BBA·(H2O)0-2 is blue shifted relative to those observed in
4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 as well as 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 This indicates that protonation/deprotonation of
4-BBA can result in shifting the dominant UV-Vis features into the actinic region in addition to
reduction in degree of hydration. Further study into the role of solvation environment, including
charge state, degree of microhydration, pH, and molecular configuration is needed to achieve a
molecular-level mechanistic picture of photosensitizing reactions at air-water interfaces.
4. Conclusion
Air-water interfaces in the environment, including the sea surface microlayer and sea spray
aerosols, are unique environments for molecular reactions, driving chemistry with fundamentally
different mechanisms than in the gas phase or in bulk water. One particularly important and
challenging class of processes are driven by BrC photosensitizers, which absorb sunlight and
transfer energy to nearby molecules.[7-13] These photosensitizer-initiated reactions can incite
processes such as electron transfer, often resulting in a cascade of radical reactions, dynamically
affecting the structure and composition of environmental air-water interfaces. Detailed
mechanisms of photosensitizing processes are extremely difficult to unravel at a molecular level
due to the complexity of air-water interface structures, resulting in broad spectroscopic features.
Spectroscopic studies of size-selected clusters have long been used to model chemistry at air-water
interfaces for precise investigation of how cluster size and conformer affect the vibrational and
electronic structure of molecular processes.[23, 30-33]
In this work we investigate the role of charge state and microhydration on the electronic
and vibrational spectroscopy of the deprotonated and protonated forms of 4-BBA clustered with
0-2 water molecules. Size-selected clusters of 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-1 and 4-BBA‒·(H2O)0-2 were
generated and studied with UV-Vis and IR action spectroscopy alongside quantum chemistry
calculations; ion signals of 4-BBAH+·(H2O)2 were too low for experimental observation, though
quantum chemistry calculations were performed to predict their spectra and electronic structure.
Vibrational action spectroscopy was used in concert with conformer searches to assign the lowest11

lying minimum structures for each cluster. UV-Vis action spectroscopy on the size-selected
clusters was performed to determine how absorption peaks of protonated and deprotonated 4-BBA
complexes shift with degree of microhydration. With the support of quantum chemistry
calculations, we find that 4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2 exhibits one dominant feature in the 280-500 nm
range that shifts non-systematically with addition of water molecules. We hypothesize that this is
due to there being two binding sites for H2O, one at the carboxylic acid and one at the protonated
ketone. Shifts in the UV-Vis absorption maximum 4-BBAH+ are thus significantly dependent on
the specific configuration and solvation environment. While the UV-Vis features of 4-BBA‒
·(H2O)0-2 were not strong enough to observe experimentally, quantum chemistry calculations
predict that each cluster exhibits one strong absorption feature that shifts systematically to the blue
as water molecules are added. This systematic blue shift occurs because water binds preferentially
to the carboxylate, even up to 8 water molecules.[21] Our experimental measurements find that
4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-1 absorbs in the solar actinic range and quantum chemistry calculations find that
this is also true of 4-BBAH+·(H2O)2. Quantum chemistry calculations predict that 4-BBA‒·(H2O)02 UV-Vis absorption features are about a factor of 3x less intense than the dominant transitions in
4-BBAH+·(H2O)0-2. Interestingly, the undersolvated clusters we studied should all exhibit
absorption in the solar actinic range, which is not true of 4-BBA and 4-BBA‒ in bulk water. This
indicates that the unique microhydration conditions of air-water interfaces can enhance the
photosensitizing activity of BrC compounds and their subsequent reaction cascades.
