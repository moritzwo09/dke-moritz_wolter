Abstract. The newly discovered artificial photosynthesis process catalyzed by 2-phenyl
indole (PI) and TiCl₄ complexes activated by visible light, produces long-chain oxygenated
hydrocarbons up to C17. This process begins with the formation of α-carboxylic
acid-ω-aldehyde compounds (C6 to C9), arising from a cascade of autocatalytic organotitanium
complexes derived from (PI)₂TiCl₄. These complexes are formed via hydrolysis by ambient air

humidity and the direct atmospheric capture (DAC) of CO₂. Carbon chain growth utilizes
system-generated formaldehyde as a feedstock. The initial C6 to C9 compounds can further
couple to C12 to C17 derivatives through a radical mechanism initiated by hydroxyl radicals. A
proposed mechanism explores the synergistic interaction between organotitanium catalysis
and hydroxyl radicals. This development represents the only known heterogeneous catalytic
system that autonomously captures CO₂ and humidity from the atmosphere to subsequently
produce long-chain oxygenated hydrocarbons using solar energy.

1. Introduction
Most artificial photosynthesis (AP) systems, including those at the forefront of research, focus on
water splitting for hydrogen production or reducing CO₂ to basic hydrocarbons (C1-C3). The ability
to synthesize long-chain compounds (up to C17) offers a transformative opportunity to produce
higher-value chemicals, advancing AP technology scalability.
The newly developed TiCl₄/2-phenylindole (PI) photocatalytic system uses visible light to convert
atmospheric CO₂ and H₂O into multi-carbon oxygenated hydrocarbons1. This breakthrough
integrates Direct Air Capture (DAC) of CO2 with conversion, addressing critical challenges in
climate change, energy sustainability, and resource efficiency.
The mechanism involves forming photoactive Ti⁴⁺-OH bonds through the hydrolysis of Ti⁴⁺-Cl
bonds by ambient air humidity. Upon exposure to light and air, these Ti⁴⁺-OH bonds release
hydroxyl radicals, facilitating the reduction of the titanium center (Ti⁴⁺ → Ti³⁺/Ti²⁺). The reduced
titanium species, with increased electron density, effectively capture atmospheric CO₂, initiating a
spontaneous and intricate reduction process that produces long-chain oxygenated hydrocarbons.
This solar-driven, autonomous production distinguishes the system from conventional AP methods.
Traditional AP approaches primarily target water splitting and CO₂ reduction to small hydrocarbons
(C1-C3) using metal oxide catalysts. These methods often require high CO₂ concentrations and
separate processes, achieving limited success. In contrast, the novel organotitanium-based system
integrates water splitting and CO₂ reduction into a single, continuous process, producing oxygenated
organics directly from ambient CO₂ (~0.04%). This capability to convert trace amounts of CO₂ into
valuable materials represents a significant leap in AP technology.
A crucial feature of this system is the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals, released from
Ti⁴⁺-OH, Ti³⁺-OH, and Ti²⁺-OH bonds. With a redox potential of 2.8 V (second only to fluorine),
hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive, yet transient species that drive the organotitanium catalytic
process. While TiO₂ photocatalysis is known to produce hydroxyl radicals, their synergistic role in
facilitating complex reaction cascades in this system is unprecedented.
Although hydroxyl radicals typically exist on the nanosecond scale, they can persist for up to 600
seconds in aqueous environments, enabling diverse redox reactions. These include dimerization to
form H₂O₂, oxidation of Ti=O bonds to peroxo-titanium species (Ti-O-O), oxidation of PI ligands to
N-O functionalities, conversion of CO₂ to HCOOH, and condensation or radical coupling involving
formaldehyde-derived intermediates.

The autonomous, multi-step nature of this system—driven by hydroxyl radical-mediated
pathways—highlights its efficiency and versatility. Understanding these transformations is essential
for optimizing or tailoring the system for specific goals, such as oxygen production via hydroxyl
radical dimerization, where pH significantly influences outcomes.
This system’s ability to sustain multiple valuable reactions in a continuous process, especially DAC
and CO₂ reduction, underscores its transformative potential. Further investigation into its
mechanism could unlock even greater industrial and environmental applications.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1 Focus
Our research explores the synthesis of oxygenated hydrocarbon products with linear chains up to
C17 using an organotitanium photocatalytic system. This breakthrough enables the direct
conversion of atmospheric carbon into complex, long-chain organic molecules, advancing green
chemistry and renewable energy goals. The visible-light-activated organotitanium complexes
exhibit self-organizing behavior, forming autocatalytic reaction networks. These networks drive
three self-sustaining cycles, where reaction products catalyze subsequent reactions, showcasing
an innovative approach to sustainable molecular assembly.

2.2 First CatalyticCycle
In the first photocatalytic cycle, the (PI)₂TiCl₄ complex serves as the essential "starter" catalyst,
initiating a self-organized cascade. This complex interacts autonomously in the solid state with
environmental inputs—visible light, H₂O, and CO₂—evolving into a sophisticated, multi-component
photocatalytic system. Similar photocatalytic behavior has been observed in titanium click chemistry
studies8.
The process begins with hydrolysis of (PI)₂TiCl₄ by atmospheric moisture, forming intermediate
complex 1, which converts to complex 2 (see Figure 1). Under visible light, complex 1 reacts with
CO₂, forming organotitanium carbonate complex 10 (illustrated in Figure 2), while complex 2
releases hydroxyl radicals, generating Ti+2 complex 3. Complexes 1 and 3 capture atmospheric CO₂
(0.04%), a significant advance for climate change mitigation research.
Complex 4 coordinates with system-generated CO, replacing a PI ligand to form complex 8. This
coordination facilitates CO insertion into the Ti-C bond, yielding the unique titanium
α-ketocarboxylate complex 9. The four-membered Ti-O-C-C titanaoxetane ring structure, previously
observed9 in rhodium, silver, and other metals, appears for the first time in titanium chemistry as a
ketocarboxylate ring.
Alternatively, complex 4 undergoes hydrolysis to form complex 5, which, upon irradiation, releases
hydroxyl radicals and transforms into complex 6. This complex then rearranges into formaldehyde
coordination complex 7, by reacting with the newly released hydroxyl radicals.
The carbonate complex 10 (Figure 2), formed from activated complex 1 and captured atmospheric
CO₂, can generate formaldehyde (complex 12) and/or methanol (complex 13) through a
hydrogenation mechanism. Hydrogen is produced internally via photocatalytic water splitting1. The
continuous catalytic cycle shown in Figure 2, incorporating DAC of CO₂, provides a sustainable

source of formaldehyde and methanol as valuable feedstocks.

Figure 2. Hydrogenation of carbonate complex 10 yielding formaldehyde (complex 12)
and/or methanol (complex 13).

2.3. Second Catalytic Cycle
The THF-coordinated analog of complex 9, identified as complex 14 (Figure 3) in
MALDI-TOF analysis, initiates a new cycle in the cascade process, aiding the formation of
long-chain organics. It uses formaldehyde as a building block, leading to the formation of
complexes 15, 16, and 17. The THF coordination in complexes 14–17 is specific to the
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ng990-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1491-3359 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

experimental conditions, as these were conducted in THF. In the absence of THF, complex 9 is
expected to directly coordinate with formaldehyde.
The α-ketocarboxylate complex 14 undergoes a photocatalytic transformation to form ketene
complex 15 and cumulene derivative 16 through a condensation with formaldehyde. The
reaction involves dehydration via H₂O elimination, followed by hydrogenation to yield complex
17. While not detected by MALDI-TOF, it seems that a third condensation step occurs, likely
contributing to the partially hydrogenated product. Complex 17, with four carbon atoms on the
pendant chain, leads to the PI oxygenated analog (complex 21, Figure 6), which is crucial in the
third and final catalytic cycle.
Titanium in complex 14 is highly electrophilic due to the electron-withdrawing chloride ligands
and the carbonyl moieties of the titanaoxetane ring. This allows formaldehyde, with its
nucleophilic oxygen, to react readily with the titanium center, forming complex 18 (Figure 4).
The second catalytic cycle begins with complex 14, which initiates a novel formaldehyde
condensation process, driving the formation of long-chain organic molecules through a series of
orchestrated steps outlined below:

Figure 3. Photocatalytic conversion of the α-ketocarboxylate complex 14 results in ketene 15
and cumulene derivative 16 via an apparent formaldehyde condensation with a keto group,
accompanied by H₂O elimination. The hydrogenated complex 17 likely originates from a
related intermediate, featuring a pendant carbon chain with four carbon atoms

dehydration and formation of ketene complex 20.
1. Formation of Ketene: An Aldol condensation occurs between formaldehyde and the
carbonyl group of complex 14, facilitated by the coordination of formaldehyde to titanium,
as shown in Figure 4.
2. Repeating Reactions: The Aldol condensation proceeds iteratively, forming complex 16
with a cumulene side chain. While formaldehyde could theoretically react further with
complex 16 to produce a compound containing four consecutive double bonds, such a
structure would be intrinsically unstable. Nonetheless, evidence for the transient existence

of such intermediate is supported by the detection of hydrogenated complex 17,
characterized by a side chain of four carbon atoms, terminating in a reactive aldehyde
group.
Again, the reaction sequence of the second cycle underscore the central role of complex 9
(or the analogous THF coordinated 14) as the initiating catalyst and driver, achieving
long-chain organic molecules production.

2.4. MALDI-TOF MS Data.
The structures of catalytic intermediates formed through the cascade transformations of the original
(PI)₂TiCl₄ complex were primarily elucidated via MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser
Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry), which has proven highly effective in
characterizing transition metal catalysts 10,11 . MALDI-TOF is particularly advantageous for
identifying intact metal complexes. Besides MALDI-TOF, the detailed process of deciphering this
dynamic chemical system’s cascade sequence and verifying individual complexes and other
products was supported by other key observations as well:
(a) Comparative reactivity analysis of similar organotitanium systems, including hydroxyl radical
formation by a substituted ansa-titanocene dihydroxido complex under daylight irradiation2,3 and the
established ability of titanium oxo (Ti=O) groups to convert to peroxo species (Ti-O-O-) upon H₂O₂
exposure; (b) Observations of ordered reaction sequences across multiple sub-cycles of the
photosynthetic cascade, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2; (c) Expected formation of trichloro- and
dichloro-titanium PI complexes upon daylight-induced reduction of the titanium tetrachloride PI
coordination compound12.
Complexes in Figure 11, Figure 2 and Figure 3 are labeled with calculated molecular weights (MW)
and expected m/z ratios, which reflect the natural isotopic distribution of the elements in each
complex, along with the experimentally recorded MALDI-TOF MS data. The close match between
calculated (MW, m/z) values and the experimental MS data strongly support the structural identity
of each complex.
Figure 5 displays the MALDI-TOF spectrum in CH₂Cl₂ for a (PI)₂TiCl₄ complex exposed to air and
daylight over three weeks, highlighting mostly organic products. These products and their identities
are discussed in detail. The relative concentrations of these materials are represented by the relative
peak intensities in the MALDI-TOF spectrum, summarized in Table 1. The identification of each
organotitanium catalytic intermediate was addressed in our previous publication1, which includes
Figure 5.

2.5. Third Catalytic Cycle.
The cascade operation continues with a third cycle, as shown in Figure 6. It begins with the
N-oxidation of the PI ligand in complex 17, most likely facilitated by hydroxyl radicals, forming
complex 21. This new sequence introduces a unique formaldehyde condensation process
involving the aldehyde group on the side chain of the organotitanium complexes. This leads to
the consecutive formation of complexes 22, 23, and 24, marking another step in the cascade
transformation.

Figure 6. Third catalytic cycle. New-type condensation of formaldehyde with the aldehyde group
of the side chain on organotitanium complex 21. Consecutive carbon addition and double-bond
creation on the side chain, from complex 21 to complex 24.
A breakdown of the second sub-cycle highlights the following key steps:
1. N-Oxidation: Complex 17 undergoes N-oxidation by hydroxyl radicals to form complex 21,
initiating the third sub-cycle.
2. Condensation with Formaldehyde: Complex 21 reacts with formaldehyde, forming complex 22,
which undergoes two further condensations to yield complexes 23 and 24..
3. Carbon Chain Growth: Each condensation extends the carbon chain, adding a unit and creating
conjugated double bonds. The process halts when the double bond reaches the titanaoxetane ring in
complex 24.

The third cycle reaction sequence illustrates a novel formaldehyde condensation mechanism,
enabling complex organotitanium structures to autonomously generate unsaturated
α,ω-carboxylic acids-aldehydes. This process exhibits significant potential for additional
carbon chain growth and radical coupling reactions. These advancements further underline the

system's ability to construct intricate organic frameworks, offering transformative insights into
organotitanium chemistry and catalytic cascade design, which will be elaborated upon in
subsequent sections.

2.6. Hydroxyl radicals-assisted reaction of aldehyde with formaldehyde.
The systematic “carbon growth” with system-produced formaldehyde as the building block is
most likely related to the titanium photocatalyzed radical coupling of formaldehyde with
methanol13. Hydrogen abstraction from the aldehyde side arm of complex 21 induced by
hydroxyl radicals will create the corresponding 21 radical complex, Figure 7. This radical
couples with formaldehyde creating a 21+CH2O radical intermediate, which isomerizes into an
alcohol/aldehyde radical. Via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from hydroxyl radicals, a
dehydration intermediate forms. Subsequent dehydration yields the conjugated double bond
seen in complex 22, showcasing an orderly mechanism for chain extension.

2.7 Formation of C6 to C9 Oxygenated Hydrocarbons
The hydrolytic separation of complexes 22, 23, and 24 yields three primary organic products,
identified by MALDI-TOF as MS 128.1728, MS 140, and MS 152, respectively (Figure 8). These
products correspond to distinct stages of the chain-growth process. Furthermore, these intermediates
demonstrate versatility through subsequent transformations, such as acid-catalyzed double-bond
hydration, producing a hydrated derivative (MS 176.93), or partial hydrogenation, yielding MS 156.
These pathways highlight the catalytic system's capability to generate a diverse array of organic
molecules through targeted modifications of the initial products.

Figure 8. α,ω-Cx carboxylic acid-aldehyde unsaturated organics (x=6, 7, 8), identified as
MS 128.1728, 140, 152, generated by hydrolysis from complexes 22, 23, 24, respectively.
Second Row: Corresponding hydrated (MS 176.93) and partially hydrogenated (MS 156)
products.
The MALDI-TOF MS data points 199, 216, and 231.939 correspond to three sequentially
hydrated C9 unsaturated organic compounds, as illustrated in Figure 9. These structures are
identified as hydrated derivatives of a parent C9 unsaturated α-carboxylic acid-ω-aldehyde
compound. However, the exact formation mechanism of this parent compound remains
unclear and could not be conclusively determined. This ambiguity underscores a critical gap
in understanding the cascade reaction process, necessitating further investigation into the
pathways responsible for the generation of these hydrated organic derivatives..

Figure 9. MALDI-TOF identified C9 oxygenated derivatives.
The organic products corresponding to MS 216 and MS 231.939, both C9 hydrated
unsaturated derivatives, are involved in coupling reactions with a PI radical. In these
reactions, the PI radical facilitates the extension or functionalization of the C9 framework.

2.7. Creation of C12 to C17 and PI coupling products. The essential role of
hydroxyl radicals.
The next category of products includes C12 to C17 linear carbon chains, with a notably high
concentration of C16 organics. The conspicuous absence of C10 to C13 chains and the apparent
upper limit at C17 products are particularly striking. Interestingly, the C12 products in this
group originate from an unexpected radical dimerization of MS 128.1728, a C6 compound
mentioned earlier (Figure 8). Hydrogen abstraction from the aldehyde functionality of this
compound by hydroxyl radicals generates the corresponding C6 radical, which subsequently
dimerizes to form the C12 α,ω-diacid (MS 253.909, Figure 10). Similarly, the C16 product
(MS 306) arises from a partially hydrogenated C8 monomer. In this case, aldehyde hydrogen
abstraction by hydroxyl radicals produces a C8 radical that dimerizes to yield an
α,ω-dicarboxylic acid containing an unsaturated diketone functionality. These findings

provide valuable insights into the radical-driven pathways that govern the formation of
higher-order organic products in this system.

A C14 dimer originating from the C7 MS 140 monomer could not be found, but a coupling
product between a hydrogenated C6 and C7 monomer radical was identified yielding the C13 dicarboxylic acid diketone MS 272, Figure 11.

In addition to this product, three closely related C16 organics are observed in the MALDI-TOF
spectrum:

A derivative with an additional hydroxyl group (MS 358).
A compound featuring exclusively single carbon-carbon bonds and one extra hydroxyl group
(MS 378).
3. A fully hydrogenated version of the MS 378 compound, where the two ketone groups are
reduced to hydroxyl groups, resulting in MS 382.
These findings highlight the diversity of C16 compounds generated within this system, reflecting
the intricate interplay of radical dimerization, partial hydrolysis, and hydrogenation processes.

2.8 Coupling of C9 products with 2-Phenyl Indole Radicals
A third class of compounds produced by our photocatalytic system arises from radical-induced
couplings between C9 oxygenated keto radicals and PI radicals, yielding MS 407 and MS 423
(Figure 14). The formation of these products aligns with the expected availability of PI radicals, as
evidenced by the previously described radical oligomerization of PI during system operation1.
This class also includes two additional products, MS 457.947 and MS 474.12, which result from the
coupling of related C9 radicals with 5-position chlorinated PI radicals (Figure 15). Notably, the
coupling process appears to favor C9 acid/alcohol unsaturated chain keto radicals over shorter
counterparts (C6–C8). This preference may be attributed to the longer half-life of C9 radicals within
the system.

generating diverse organic products through a combination of radical coupling, oligomerization,
hydrolysis, and hydrogenation processes.

4. Conclusion
The production of C6-C17 oxygenated hydrocarbons from organotitanium compounds as described in
this study represents a significant advancement in the field of organotitanium chemistry and
artificial photosynthesis. Our work demonstrates that titanium-based catalysts, when properly tuned,
can facilitate the formation of valuable, longer-chain oxygenated hydrocarbons under mild
conditions. This method leverages the unique properties of titanium, particularly its ability to form
stable intermediates while maintaining high reactivity, which has allowed for a cleaner and more
direct pathway from simple starting materials, such as atmospheric CO2 and water.
This research highlights the potential of organotitanium chemistry to bridge the gap between
laboratory-scale artificial photosynthesis processes and practical applications in chemical synthesis
and renewable energy. The capability to directly produce C6-C17 hydrocarbons, which are critical
intermediates in the chemical industry, positions this method as a promising alternative to
conventional petrochemical routes. By generating these compounds from sustainable sources, we
move one step closer to replacing fossil fuel–dependent methods with environmentally friendly and
carbon-neutral processes.
Additionally, the ability to control the chain length and functionalization of these oxygenated
hydrocarbons provides a versatile platform for synthesizing a range of chemicals, including
biofuels, lubricants, and specialty chemicals. Future work will focus on further optimizing the
catalyst system to enhance selectivity, yield, and overall efficiency. Moreover, improving our
understanding of the reaction mechanisms at play will help in scaling up the process for industrial
application, ensuring that it is not only sustainable but also economically viable.
In conclusion, this study opens new avenues for the use of organotitanium compounds in the
generation of oxygenated hydrocarbons, contributing to the ongoing efforts to develop artificial
photosynthesis technologies. The implications of this work extend beyond synthetic chemistry,
offering a pathway to reduce carbon emissions and create more sustainable industrial processes.
Future research will aim to address the challenges of scalability, economic feasibility, and
environmental impact, with the ultimate goal of integrating this system into broader renewable
energy frameworks.
