Abstract

16

The extensive use of human-made chemicals in our daily lives results in chronic exposure to

17

complex mixtures of potentially harmful substances. We investigated chemical exposures in

18

pregnant women in New York City by applying a non-targeted analysis (NTA) workflow to 95

19

paired prenatal urine and serum samples (35 pairs of preterm birth) collected as part of the New

20

York University Children’s Health and Environment Study. The goal was to i) study chemical

21

exposures in this population, ii) explore differences in the chemical profiles comparing urine

22

vs. serum samples, and comparing preterm vs. term birth samples, and iii) investigate potential

23

associations between exogenous chemicals and endogenous metabolites. We analyzed all

24

samples using liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry

25

(LC-Orbitrap HRMS) in both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes (ESI+ and

26

ESI-), employing full scan and data-dependent MS/MS fragmentation (ddMS2) scans. We

27

detected a total of 1,524 chemical features for annotation, with 12 chemicals confirmed by

28

authentic standards. Two confirmed chemicals dodecyltrimethylammonium and n,n-

29

dimethyldecylamine n-oxide appear to not have been previously reported in human blood

30

samples. We observed a statistically significant differential enrichment between urine and

31

serum samples, as well as between preterm and term birth (p < 0.0001) in serum samples. When

32

comparing

cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (tentative), showed a statistical significance difference (p = 0.003)

34

with more abundance in preterm birth in serum. An example of chemical associations (12

35

associations in total) observed was between surfactants (tertiary amines) and endogenous

36

metabolites (e.g., bioactive lipid mediators and fatty acid amides).

1. Introduction

43

Human beings are already exposed to hundreds of thousands of synthetic chemicals through

44

exposure to consumer products, packaged and processed food, contaminated drinking water,

45

and polluted air, and the number is only increasing.1 Many of these chemicals may be adsorbed

46

by the human body and potentially pose a threat to human health. In addition new compounds,

47

also known as transformation products, might form through biotic and abiotic processes when

48

these chemicals are exposed to different environments.2, 3 Approximately 350,000 registered

49

chemical substances have been used for commercial production and use over the past 40 years

50

across 19 countries and regions.4 Moreover, the United States Environmental Protection

51

Agency (US EPA) has listed over 1,218,248 chemicals of environmental importance on EPA’s

52

CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/). Recent estimates

53

suggest that only 10% of chronic human diseases can be attributed to genetics, leaving 90%

54

potentially related at least in part to environmental factors.5

55

Pregnant women are routinely exposed to human-made chemicals from the ambient

56

environment that may result in adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. Previous studies

57

have highlighted that maternal exposure to environmental contaminants can increase the risk

58

of obesity,6 asthma,7 and various conditions in offspring, including pre-term birth.8 The timing

59

of exposure is also an important factor as the effects of an exposure likely depend on the

60

developmental processes that it coincides with. Epidemiological evidence indicates that

61

exposure to environmental contaminants at any time between preconception and birth can

62

restrict fetal growth, resulting in a fetus not reaching its full growth potential (lower birth weight

63

than expected).9 The fetal brain is particularly susceptible to prenatal exposure to endocrine5

64

disrupting chemicals, as neurulation and neuronal proliferation begin within the first trimester,

65

while other processes such as neural migration, myelination, synaptogenesis, and apoptosis start

66

mid-gestation and continue rapidly until birth.10, 11 Investigating chemical exposure during the

67

critical windows can provide insight on underlying biological mechanisms.

68

Traditional monitoring of contaminants in human samples relies on prior hypotheses, the

69

availability of analytical standards, and the existence of a validated chromatographic method.

70

Approximately 450 environmental chemicals are regularly measured in human samples (e.g.,

71

whole blood, serum, and urine) by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

72

(NHANES).12 This only accounts for approximately 0.5% and 0.04% of chemicals listed under

73

a US federal law of Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and EPA’s CompTox Chemicals

74

Dashboard, respectively. Such conventional approaches cannot capture the totality of chemical

75

exposures and consequently important associations with various health outcomes may be

76

missed. Recent advancements in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) have improved

77

our ability to analyze thousands of different chemicals in a single run due to its high resolving

78

power (> 30,000 FWHM), mass accuracy (1-5 ppm), and high scan speed.13 Combined with a

79

pre-separation technique such as gas or liquid chromatography (GC/LC), HRMS shows great

80

promise in detecting unknown chemicals across various domains.14 In recent years, non-

81

targeted analysis (NTA) using HRMS has successfully been used to screen human samples,

82

resulting in the discovery of numerous exogenous compounds (e.g., pesticide metabolites,

83

endocrine‑disrupting compounds, and poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances).15-17 Numerous

84

studies for unknown compounds have focused on the possible compounds that were postulated

85

with suspect lists.18 There is currently a great need for the application of NTA to characterize

86

different pathways of exposures in public health studies.

87

Based on previous NTA methods,17, 19, 20 we developed a workflow to comprehensively

88

profile all detectable chemical exposures and metabolites in biospecimens from a racially and

89

socioeconomically diverse sample of pregnant women from New York City. The aims of this

90

study were threefold: (1) to analyze 95 paired serum and urine samples from pregnant women

91

using NTA and study their chemical exposures, (2) characterize differences in chemical

92

enrichment between urine and serum, within each biospecimen type, between preterm and term

93

births, and (3) explore the associations of endogenous metabolites with exogenous chemicals.

94

2. Materials and methods

95

2.1 Study participants information

96

For this study we used paired urine and serum samples collected between 2020 and 2022

97

during the same prenatal study visit from 95 participants in the New York University Children’s

98

Health and Environment Study (NYU CHES). NYU CHES is an ongoing pregnancy and birth

99

cohort study that has been recruiting pregnant patients  18 years of age and < 18 weeks of

100

gestation from NYU Langone Health-affiliated hospitals since March, 2016. The samples were

101

mostly collected in the first trimester with 2 and 5 pairs for the second and third trimesters,

102

respectively. Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. All samples, including 10

103

blinded quality control (QC) samples consisting of synthetic urine and serum, were stored in

104

bisphenol- and phthalate-free polypropylene tubes at -80°C.

2.2 Workflow

111

The NTA workflow contained three major steps: (1) sample treatment and chemical analysis,

112

(2) data cleansing and processing, and (3) data analysis (Figure 1). In this work, the individual

113

samples and pooled samples were aimed to obtain MS1 and MS1/MS2 spectra, respectively. The

114

MS2 spectra from pooled samples were matched to MS1 spectra from the individual samples for

115

database match. We used MS1 data to examine the differences in chemical enrichment between

116

different groups of samples, MS2 spectra to match available databases composed of authentic

117

standards and in silico predicted spectra, and to match to authentic standards in our laboratory.

118

The chemical abundances in the diluted urine samples were adjusted using the creatinine

119

normalization approach (Details in Text S1, Supporting Information). Chemical

120

identifications and annotations were ranked based on the system proposed by Schymanski, et

121

al. 21 The various confidence levels are as follows: Level 1, structure confirmed by a chemical

122

standard with MS/MS and retention time (RT) matching; Level 2, probable structure deduced

123

by spectrum database matching or other diagnostic evidence (e.g., parent ion information and

124

MS/MS); Level 3, tentative candidate(s) supported by partial evidence for possible structure(s),

125

but insufficient evidence for the exact structure(s); Level 4, an unequivocal molecular formula

126

can be assigned through the spectral information but no enough information to propose possible

127

structures; Level 5, only exact mass (m/z) with insufficient information to assign a formula.

128

Considering the complexity and heterogenous components in the present samples, different

129

methods and tools were applied to explore and analyze the MS data (Figure 1). Following this

130

workflow, we first used MS-DIAL to export the MS data for statistical analysis and MS/MS

131

database matching. Python was used as the programing language for data analysis. All python

2.3 Sample preparation and analysis

140

All samples were completely thawed at room temperature (~21°C) and homogenized using

141

a vortex mixer before extraction. For individual samples, 100 µL of sample was pipetted into a

142

microcentrifuge tube. For pooled samples, 15 pools each of serum and urine were constructed

143

from 10 individual 20 µL samples (200 µL total) randomly selected based on sample IDs using

144

Python’s random.choices() method. For extraction, 400 µL methanol was added to the tube,

145

which was then shaken using a vortex mixer and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The upper

146

clear layer of methanol was immediately filtered into an auto-sampler vial with an insert using

147

a nylon membrane (pore size: 0.2 µm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Triplicates of HPLC water

148

were used as laboratory blanks and followed the same sample preparation procedure.

149

Analysis of the extracts was conducted using a Vanquish UHPLC and Orbitrap Exploris 240

150

MS (Thermo-Scientific, Waltham, MA). LC separation was achieved with an Ascentis® 3 µm

151

C18 HPLC column (150 × 2.1 mm) (Sigma-Aldrich Supelco, St. Louis, MO) by gradient elution

152

with 5% methanol + 95% HPLC water (A) and 100% methanol (B), both containing 0.1%

153

formic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min-1 and column temperature of 45 °C. The gradient

154

method started at 5%B, ramping linearly to 100%B over 15 min, held for 5 min, and returning

155

to starting conditions for column re-equilibration between 20.1 – 25 min.

156

The compounds in the samples were ionized using a heated electrospray ionization (HESI)

157

probe in both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) modes. The Orbitrap MS method used the

158

following global parameters: sheath gas flow = 35; aux gas flow = 10; sweep gas flow = 1;

159

vaporizer temperature = 400 °C; spray voltage = 3300/2000 (positive/negative); S-lens RF =

160

70%; ion transfer tube temperature = 352 °C. A full MS/data-dependent MS2 spectra acquisition

161

(ddMS2) method was used with the following scan settings: 90,000/12,000 resolution,

162

normalized AGC target = standard, max injection time = auto, normalized HCD collision

163

energy (%) = 30, 50, 70, full MS scan range of 100-1000 m/z and ddMS2 isolation window of

164

0.7 m/z and scan number of 10. To confirm the selected chemicals with annotations from Levels

165

2 and 3, a full MS/product ion scan was conducted for authentic standards and samples.

166

2.4 Chemical annotations and source attributions

167

It is critical to discern whether the detected compounds are exogenous or endogenous,

168

especially those expected in urine and serum samples. Many compounds enter the human body

169

through food ingestion (e.g., nutrients and natural products) and drugs (including intermediate

170

chemicals during pharmaceutical production) and their derivatives. The metabolic processes in

171

the human body create a plethora of transformation products from the parent compounds.

172

A challenge that we encountered when trying to attribute sources to the detected compounds

173

was that compounds often have multiple uses and can be both endogenous and exogenous.22

174

Another challenge when dealing with chemical databases related to the human exposome is

175

that, in many cases, only the monoisotopic mass of the chemical is available for matching, and

176

the MS2 spectra are missing. To confirm the chemicals in our samples, all data were first

177

matched by the databases containing MS1 and MS2 from authentic standards, i.e., MS-DIAL

178

metabolomics, MassBank of North America, Massbank Europe, and mzCloud. Afterwards, the

179

sources

database

183

We compiled information from multiple sources to reflect whether the compounds are

184

intentionally ingested and whether they are industrial or natural products. The integrated data

185

of identified compounds (Levels 1 and 2) are listed in Supporting Information Spreadsheet

186

S1, where we present five categories of sources and uses:

187
188

(1) Endogenous Metabolites: Substances naturally produced from human issues during the
metabolism process.

189

(2) Natural Products: substances derived from food or nutrients.

190

(3) Drugs: Substances intentionally ingested by people for different treatments, such as

191
192
193
194
195

therapeutics/prescription drugs.
(4) Personal Care Products (PCPs): Substances used in cosmetics or other personal care
products.
(5) Exogenous Contaminants: Substances present in human working/living environments,
such as additives in house furnishings.

196

If there was no source indicated, the source of the compound was marked as “unknown”.

197

While it is generally expected that one compound will be attributed to one category, it is often

198

the case that one compound can have multiple sources. For example, d-camphor (CAS: 464-

199

48-2) was attributed to several sources because it is a constituent of various foods, medicines

200

(such as treatment of colds and topical analgesics), and various cosmetics in the US. Some

201

derivatives were annotated based on their parent compounds.

202

2.5 Data processing

203

2.5.1 Imputation and batch effects

204

All data processing was done using Python (version 3.11.5) as the programming language
14

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zh59c ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-7520 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

205

and the following packages for data handling, data analysis and visualizations: pandas, numpy,

206

matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy. The scripts were written using the JupyterLab and Spyder

207

interfaces. Before data analysis, the dataset was processed for imputation (substituting missing

208

data) and batch correction. We first calculated the frequency of each chemical feature among

209

the samples and selected a frequency of 70% as the cutoff for imputation. The method detection

210

limits (MDLs) were set as the minimum peak area (≥ 10,000). To fill in the data points below

211

the MDLs, we used a previously developed imputation method.17 Briefly, the peak areas were

212

first log-transformed and then the missing values imputed from the left tail of the distribution

213

that was fit to the data. The imputation algorithm inputs random values between the absolute

214

minimum value (0) and the measured minimum value that originated from the cut-off points

215

generated during processing of chromatographic peaks with MS-DIAL.

216

In total, 190 samples (95 serum and 95 urine) were analyzed in four batches (~47 samples

217

each batch) for instrumental analysis. For each batch, randomly positioned samples consisted

218

of both urine and serum samples. To avoid systematic differences between batches, urine

219

samples were run with their corresponding serum samples. The remaining batch effects were

220

corrected

221

(https://github.com/brentp/combat.py). The details of the batch correction method have been

222

described in the study of Johnson et al.23 This package employs parametric and non-parametric

223

Bayes methods for adjusting data for batch effects.

We conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to examine the differences before and

227

after “Combat” batch correction among four batches. We also conducted a correlation analysis

228

for the correlation of the PCs 1-3 with sample type and batch.

229

The differences for groups of similar data points of chemical composition between urine and

230

serum samples, and between preterm birth and term birth samples were evaluated by employing

231

hierarchically-clustered heatmap using the Seaborn Python package24. The differential

232

enrichment of chemical features was quantified by comparing the relative abundance of

233

chemical features between urine/preterm birth and the corresponding serum/term birth samples.

234

2.5.2.2 Relationships of chemical features in different sample types

235

The relative abundance and detected percentage were used to explore the relationships of

236

chemical features between urine and serum samples. The abundance was first log-transformed

237

and then averaged across all 95 samples for each chemical feature. The average values were

238

used for the linear regression model to examine the correlation between urine and serum

239

samples.

240

We used a volcano plot of average areas of chemical features to assess statistical significance

241

(p < 0.05) through a t-test and the magnitude of change (fold change > 1.2) between preterm

242

birth and term birth samples (in serum and urine, respectively), as well as between serum and

243

urine samples. This approach helps identify chemicals that differ significantly between preterm

244

and term birth samples and between serum and urine samples.

245

2.5.2.3 Molecular network analysis for different annotated chemicals

246

After annotating chemical features as described in Section 2.4, Pearson correlations between

247

chemicals annotated as endogenous metabolites and all other annotated chemicals were used

248

for molecular network analysis. In this study, the network indicates the association between

249

chemical features. The purpose of the network is to visualize the inter-and intra-molecular

250

associations between endogenous metabolites and other chemical features, including

251

exogenous contaminants. After calculating p values and t-scores between endogenous

252

metabolites and other chemicals (Schymanski Levels 1-3), the p values were adjusted using the

253

Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate of 5% method for multiple comparisons. For the

254

visualization d3.js (https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/network_basic.html) was used to show

255

the networks for relationships between endogenous metabolites and other chemicals. Because

256

of the large number of associations in the complex network, we only focused on the Level 1

257

and 2 compounds with an absolute correlation coefficient (R) > 0.5 and revisualized the

258

networks based on these chemicals.

For conducting correlations, we used Pearson's R, and for statistical differences between two

261

groups (e.g., preterm and term birth), we used a t-test. The p-values were adjusted using the

262

Benjamini–Hochberg test with a null hypothesis of 5% false positives. Statistical significance

263

for two data groups derived from the same dataset (e.g., differential analysis of PC1 for preterm

264

and term in urine and serum samples) was determined using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney Rank

265

Sum test combined with Bonferroni correction.

266

2.6 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)

267

Batch analyses of samples were conducted by running three blanks, i.e., solvent blank,

268

laboratory blank, and field blank. Two solvent blanks were run for each five samples. The QC

269

samples were run at each batch to monitor the stability of the instrument, including RT shifts,

270

mass accuracy, and peak intensity (Spreadsheet S2). EPA Phthalate Esters Mix (Sigma-Aldrich,

271

St. Louis, MO) was used for QC with a five-point calibration curve ranging from 50 – 1000 ng

mL-1. After running each batch, a Python package was run to filter the targeted m/z from

273

monoisotopic masses (mass tolerance: 5 ppm) and to check the aligned other values, e.g., m/z,

274

RT, and R values (> 0.5 for all expected compounds) obtained from the linearity (Spreadsheet

275

S2). All QC compounds were used for ESI+ while only dibutyl phthalate was used for ESI- due

276

to other compounds being poorly charged in negative polarity. In addition to commercial

277

standard mixes for QC, we also made a mixture solution consisting of 17 analytical standards,

278

following the same running and checking procedure as the EPA mixture (Results are shown in

279

Spreadsheet S2). The field and laboratory blanks used HPLC water to do the same extraction

280

for the same containers used during the collection procedure. The data collected from all blank

281

samples were used to remove the chemical features of which the abundances were 3 times lower

282

in real samples than those in the blank samples.

283

3. Results

284

3.1 Filtering and confirmation of chemical features

285

After the alignment of 4 batches, the total amount of chemical features in both urine and

286

serum samples (n total = 190 samples) without clean-up processing from the full scan was

287

112,737 for ESI+ and 82,335 for ESI- (Figure S1, Supporting Information). After eliminating

288

the features that were adducts that were linked to other ion(s) and frequency below 70%, the

289

processed dataset was decreased to 21,952 features for ESI+ and 10,006 features for ESI-. By

290

merging the ESI+ and ESI- datasets (± monoisotopic H: 1.00782), the pair of 2219 features in

291

both ESI+ and ESI- was observed based on the RT time difference < 0.5 min and mass difference

292

≤ 5 ppm.

293

These features were then matched to the dataset from the pooled samples run by full

294

scan/ddMS2 (ESI+: 408,610; ESI-: 270,533), then further reduced by filtering the ions with

295

product ions, resulting in 1,524 features (Levels ≥ 3). The features identified from pooled

296

samples using ddMS2 scans matched those found in individual samples using full scans.

297

3.2 Batch correction

298

In the dataset without batch correction for serum samples, no clusters of PC1 and PC2

299

loadings were observed for preterm and term birth sample types (Figure 2a-1). After batch

300

correction, two distinct clusters corresponding to preterm and term birth samples were observed

301

in serum (Figure 2a-2). Post-correction, a negative correlation (R = -0.752) between PC1 and

302

preterm-term birth sample types was observed (Figure S2a). Additionally, significant

303

differences were found between PC1 and preterm-term birth sample types (p < 0.01), as well

304

as between PC2 loadings and preterm-term birth samples (p < 0.01) (Figure S2b). No batch

305

effect was observed after correction (Figure 2a-4), compared to the four distinct clusters of

306

PC1 and PC2 loadings before correction (Figure 2a-3).

307

In urine samples, clusters of PC1 and PC2 loadings for preterm and term birth were not

308

separated before batch correction (Figure 2b-1), and were only partially separated after batch

309

correction (Figure 2b-2). Post-correction, no correlation was observed between PC loadings

310

and sample type or batch (Figure S2a). However, a significant difference was observed

311

between PC1 loadings and preterm-term birth sample types (p < 0.01) (Figure S2b). The batch

312

effect in the four batches of urine samples was not pronounced before correction (Figure 2b-3)

313

and was absent after correction (Figure 2b-4).

314

In the combined serum and urine dataset before batch correction, PC1 and PC2 loadings were

315

able to separate serum and urine samples, though some data points were not well separated

316

(Figure 2c-1 & 2). After batch correction, a positive correlation (R = 0.521) was observed

317

between PC1 loadings and sample type (serum and urine) (Figure S2e). Significant differences

318

were observed between PC1 loadings and sample type or batches (p < 0.01), as well as between

319

PC3 loadings and sample type or batches (p < 0.01) (Figure S2f). Similar to urine samples, the

320

batch effect was not strong in the combined dataset before correction (Figure 2c-3) and was

321

eliminated after correction (Figure 2c-4).

3.3 Chemical Annotation

331

The processed chemical features merged from ESI+ and ESI- modes were used for database

332

matching. Out of 1,524 chemical features with MS2 information, we were able to annotate 344

333

features, with a match score of over 90% using MS-DIAL and Compound Discoverer, and 18

334

features were found to be common in both ESI+ and ESI- (Spreadsheet S1). The classification

335

of the 327 chemicals was as follows: endogenous metabolites (203), exogenous contaminants

336

(96), drugs (101), natural products (38), and PCPs (45). Additionally, many compounds were

337

annotated in multiple categories: 37 in more than two categories, 29 in more than three, 16 in

338

more than four, and 2 in more than five (Figure S3).

339

From the analytical standards in our laboratory, twelve chemicals were confirmed by

340

comparing RT, and precursor ion/product ions (difference < 5 ppm) (example shown in Figure

341

S4). The matches were confirmed for chemicals with an RT difference < 0.05 and a mass

342

difference < 5 ppm. These included two organophosphorus compounds (triisobutyl phosphate

343

and tributyl phosphate), three amines (triisopropanolamine, tributylamine, and diphenylamine),

344

three

345

dodecyltrimethylammonium, n,n-dimethyldecylamine n-oxide, propiconazole, and 2,2,6,6-

346

tetramethyl-4-piperidinol (Spreadsheet S3). The enrichment of chemicals (Levels 1-3) differed

347

between serum and urine samples (Figure S5), with most chemicals being more prevalent in

348

serum and categorized as Level 3 (unknown, no database match observed). The annotated

349

chemicals (Levels 1-2) identified as exogenous contaminants, which were detected more

350

frequently in preterm birth samples (serum and urine, respectively), are shown in Figure 3a-b.

found that four confirmed chemicals (2-phenylindole, n,n-dimethyldecylamine, propiconazole,

and urine (Figure 3a & b)

3.4 Data analysis

363

3.4.1 Difference between preterm and term birth

364

In serum, clusters of different chemicals’ enrichment were observed between preterm and

365

term birth samples (Figure 4a). The statistical differences in PC1 loadings between preterm

366

and term birth samples were significant after batch correction (p < 0.0001) (Figure 4a). Among

367

the 1,547 significantly different LC-MS features between preterm and term birth samples (p <

368

0.05), 3 out of 17 chemicals from the downregulated area (log2fold < -1.2) and 8 out of 72

369

chemicals from the upregulated area (log2fold > 1.2) could be tentatively annotated

370

(Spreadsheet S4). For example, the annotated chemicals in the downregulated area have

371

polyethylene glycol (PEG) n6 (m/z: 283.1755 [M+H+]) and centrimonium (m/z: 284.3313

372

[M+H+]) (Figure 5a). Those in the upregulated area have n-acetylhistidine (m/z: 198.0848

373

[M+H+]), and deoxycholic acid (m/z: 391.2858 [M+H-]) (Figure 5a). The annotated chemicals

374

in the upregulated area include an exogenous contaminant (1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid,

375

m/z: 173.0783 [M+H+]) and other seven compounds identified as natural products, drugs, and

376

endogenous metabolites, while those in the downregulated area were identified as exogenous

377

contaminants, drugs and personal care products (Figure S7a).

378

In urine, we did not observe distinct chemical enrichment between preterm and term birth

379

samples (Figure 4b), despite significant differences in PC1 loadings (p < 0.0001). Among the

380

9,225 significantly different LC-MS features between preterm and term birth samples (p < 0.05),

381

19 out of 427 features were tentatively annotated and they were all situated in the

382

downregulated area (Spreadsheet S4). Some of these features annotated were shown as in the

383

volcano plot, e.g., didecyldimethylammonium (m/z: 326.3782 [M+H]+) and adebosine (m/z:

384

268.1002 [M+H]+) (Figure 5b). The largest number of annotated chemicals belonged to

385

endogenous metabolites and exogenous contaminants (Figure S7b). Only one feature

386

(unknown, m/z: 704.5230 [M+H]+) was present in the upregulated area.

389

versus term births among serum samples (a) and urine samples (b), and between serum and urine samples (c) after multiple testing correction (Benjamini-

391

and 812 out of 37,270 in urine showed significant differences (p < 0.05). For the differential enrichment between serum and urine samples, 26,038 out of 37,270

392

chemical features exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05). The boxplots show the statistical difference of principal component 1 (PC1) between preterm and

3.4.2 Difference between urine and serum

405

The mean log abundances of chemical features from urine and serum samples showed a

406

positive correlation (R² > 0.5), with some chemical features diverging from the regression line

407

before imputation and batch correction for the initial dataset (Figure S8a), after imputation and

408

batch correction for the initial dataset (Figure S8b), and after imputation and batch correction

409

for the chemical features that have a frequency >70% (Figure S8c). A significant difference in

410

most chemicals was observed between urine and serum samples after batch correction (Figure

411

4c), with two distinct clusters separated with a p-value < 0.0001 for PC1 between urine and

412

serum samples (Figure 4c).

413

From the volcano plot of 25,885 chemical features (serum versus urine, p < 0.05), chemicals

414

were more predominant in serum (3,369 chemicals in the upregulated area vs. 739 chemicals

415

in the downregulated area) (Figure 5c). The chemicals with the largest fold change in the

416

downregulated and upregulated areas were tentatively annotated as docosahexaenoic acid

417

(log2fold = -10.25, m/z: 327.2333 [M-H]-) and 4-ethoxy ethylbenzoate (log2fold = 5.54, m/z:

418

195.1018 [M+H]+). In the upregulated and downregulated areas, 109 and 20 chemicals,

419

respectively, were tentatively annotated (Spreadsheet S5), with endogenous metabolites and

420

exogenous contaminants being the most frequently annotated (Figure S6c).

421

3.4.3 Association among different chemicals

422

Twelve significant associations (absolute Pearson R > 0.5) in all samples were found between

423

endogenous metabolites and exogenous contaminants (Spreadsheet S4), which only was

424

observed in serum samples. For example, p-cresyl sulfate positively correlated with 4-

425

(hydroxymethyl)benzenesulfonic acid and 4-phenol sulfonic acid (Figure S9).

426

The molecular network for significant associations (R2 > 0.5) between endogenous

427

metabolites and exogenous chemicals were shown in Figure 6. Endogenous-exogenous

428

compound correlations included d-sphingosine with n-methyldioctylamine, octadecanamine,

429

and bis(2-ethylhexy)amine. The amine compounds like octadecanamine (primary amine) and

430

bis(2-ethylhexyl) amine (tertiary amine) showed significant associations. Other correlations

431

involved r-palmitoyl-(2-methyl) ethanolamide and centrimonium, and oleamide with bis(2-

432

ethylhexyl) amine and bis(2-ethylhexyl) amine and dodecyltrimethylammonium, slightly more

433

occurring in preterm birth (~53%). Among exogenous compounds, PEG n5 was positively

434

correlated with an endogenous metabolite, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl 12-methyltrideacanote. Citric

435

acid was positively correlated with two endogenous metabolites, isocirtic acid and 1,3,4,5-

436

tetrahydroxycyclohexanecarboxylic acid.

4. Discussion

447

Among the confirmed compounds, two chemicals, dodecyltrimethylammonium and n,n-

448

dimethyldecylamine n-oxide, widely used in PCPs and as surfactants for various industrial

449

products, appear to not have been previously reported in human samples, based on our searches

450

with the Blood Exposome Database and the Human Metabolome Database. In addition, we

451

found that the azole fungicide propiconazole, a heavily used agricultural agent with

452

carcinogenic25 and endocrine-disrupting effects on humans.26 Three tertiary amine compounds

453

(triisopropanolamine, tributylamine, diphenylamine) are used in numerous industrial

454

applications such as surfactants and stabilizers, with diphenylamine and its derivatives listed as

455

propriety pollutants by the European Union.27 Two phosphate ester flame retardants, tributyl

456

phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate, were found to have higher detection rates and average

457

concentrations in serum samples compared to paired urine samples (semi-quantification shown

458

in Figure S10). This is similar to previous reports where tributyl phosphate was the

459

predominant substance in blood samples from Beijing28 and Shenzhen29, China. However,

460

triisobutyl phosphate has not been reported in human samples. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-

461

piperidinol, found in PCPs such as cosmetics, was detected in human blood.30 4-Nitrophenol, a

462

metabolite of the organophosphate pesticide methyl parathion, which is illegally applied to the

463

interiors of homes in the US,31 it was also detected in our samples. For aminophenols, 2-

464

aminophenol and 3-aminophenol could not be differentiated based on RTs (difference < 0.05

465

min) and were confirmed by product ions (Figure S4b). Aminophenols and their derivatives

466

are commercially important in dyes, petroleum additives, and pharmaceutical industries.

467

Interestingly, the commonly used 4-aminophenol was not detected in our samples, while 2- and

468

3-aminophenols, which we did detect, are less frequently reported in human samples. All pairs

469

of samples found both 2-aminophenol and 3-aminophenol with good correlation between urine

470

and serum (R2= 0.988), suggesting that products exposing pregnant women might contain both

471

aminophenols. We also found that 39 out of the 325 chemicals were not included in the blood

dodecyltrimethylammonium (Level 1), citroflex (Level 2) was annotated as exogenous

476

(Spreadsheet S8), several compounds showed a very limited number of studies:

477

dodecyltrimethylammonium (0), n,n-dimethyldecylamine n-oxide, triisopropanolamine (1),

478

and tributylamine (3). Additionally, we identified eleven tentatively annotated compounds with

similarly limited study numbers (Spreadsheet S8). These compounds require further

birth and term birth in only serum (Figure 4a). Preterm birth is a medical condition with a

483

complex pathogenesis.32 Previous reports have shown potential associations of environmental

484

contaminants with preterm birth compared with the control samples, e.g., the pesticide DDT

485

(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane),33 lead,34 and phthalates.35-37 For phthalates, diheptyl

486

phthalate (Level 2) was found in preterm birth samples. This is not surprising since phthalate

487

esters are widely used in the plasticizer industry and have been detected in human samples from

488

adults and children in Asia and North America.38 While previous studies have reported

489

significant associations of phthalates and their metabolites with the gestational age in other

490

New York City pregnancy cohorts, 39 40 we were unable to find any associations of chemical

491

features between preterm birth and term birth in either blood or urine samples. Due to the

492

limited sample numbers, we do not further elucidate this observation. It should be noted that

493

phthalates are ubiquitous and can leach from medical supplies41 and laboratory equipment,42 as

494

seen in our current raw dataset where many phthalates were present in laboratory controls and

495

even in solvent blanks, complicating source identification. Therefore, we do not further

496

speculate on the sources of diheptyl phthalate from our samples.

497

In serum, among all annotated chemicals with features significantly different (p < 0.05) in

498

preterm birth samples and 1.2-fold higher abundances compared to term birth samples (Figure

499

5a), only 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid was categorized as an exogenous contaminant. This

500

compound is used in the production of nylon and polyester resins for various purposes, such as

501

enhancing plasticizing efficiency and hardness.43 Exposure to this compound may occur

502

through ingestion and inhalation of its products in the environment. Although 1,4-

503

cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid is currently under the TSCA, it is not listed in the Blood

504

Exposome Database. To our knowledge, no studies have reported the detection of 1,4-

505

cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid in human samples. Other compounds, such as p-coumaric acid,

506

ellagic acid, and bisoprolol, are commonly used in drugs or health products for dietary

507

antioxidants, antioxidant activity, and hypertension management. These chemicals may suggest

508

that some preterm births, which are often medically necessary, could be linked to the mother’s

509

use of medications for underlying complications. Regarding endogenous metabolites,

510

deoxycholic acid, a bile acid, is one of the main bile acids present in the meconium of preterm

511

infants, entering the fetus through placental transfer. More recent studies have also shown that
38

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zh59c ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-7520 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

512

changes in total bile acids are directly related to preterm birth rates.44, 45

513

For the annotated chemicals that were significantly different (p < 0.05) in preterm birth

514

samples, with lower abundances compared to term birth samples, we identified two exogenous

515

contaminants in serum and six in urine. However, these contaminants were not detected with

516

higher frequency in preterm birth samples or in either urine or serum. The negative fold change

517

in these chemicals might be attributed to individual sample variations compared to endogenous

518

metabolites and differences in sampling times for urine. We do not further explain this

519

observation.

520

We also observed that adenosine (an endogenous metabolite), which was significantly

521

different in preterm birth, showed decreased abundances in both serum and urine samples

522

(Figure 5d). Adenosine is a common endogenous nucleoside that generally counteracts ATP-

523

induced effects, such as inflammation.46 It has been demonstrated that adenosine levels can

524

increase during normal pregnancy due to platelet activation and elevated nucleosidase

525

activity.47 Interestingly, adenosine, a marker of oxidative stress, has been found to be

526

significantly higher in pregnant women with preeclampsia compared to those without the

527

condition.48 Lower levels of adenosine in both urine and serum might be linked to preterm birth

528

outcomes. Although endogenous metabolites were not the primary focus of this study, the levels

529

of adenosine associated with preterm birth have not been reported. his warrants further attention

530

from researchers, especially since adenosine is also used as a drug for treating supraventricular

531

tachycardia during pregnancy.49 Generally, we observed a broader range of chemicals, both

532

endogenous and exogenous, in serum samples (Figure 3c). This allows for the identification of

533

both biomarker chemicals and exogenous contaminants. Nonetheless, some exogenous

534

contaminants, such as centrimonium, were found to be more enriched in urine samples.

535

We found that paired prenatal urine and serum samples have different enrichment of chemical

536

features (Figure 4c), despite some endogenous chemicals showing a significantly higher

537

proportion in the serum samples (Spreadsheet S1). Of the tentatively identified compounds we

538

detected (Level 2, Spreadsheet S1), many were endogenous compounds or pharmaceuticals

539

and their transformation products as part of metabolism in the human body.

540

Some endogenous chemicals showed an association with exogenous contaminants. For

541

example, p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS) correlated with 4-phenolsulfonic acid (4-PSA) and 4-

542

(hydroxymethyl)benzenesulfonic acid (4-HMBSA) (Figure S9). p-CS is a prototype protein-

543

bound molecule derived from the secondary metabolism of p-cresol, where increased

544

concentrations can be associated with deteriorating kidney function.50 4-PSA is a common

545

intermediate/component of surfactants, detergents, pharmaceuticals, and dyes. 4-HMBSA is a

546

derivative of substituted benzenesulfonic acids, widely used as intermediates for organic

547

compound synthesis. 4-PSA has been listed in the ToxCast database,51 while the human toxicity

548

for both 4-PSA and 4-HMBSA is not clear. In the current network, significant relationships

549

were observed among PEGs, composed of polyether compounds with repeating ethylene glycol

550

units. PEGs are used as components in drugs and PCPs. Narrowly defined molecular weight

551

ranges of PEGs are often produced as a commercial mixture,52 similar to our data showing a

552

correlated pattern with the loss of ethylene oxide (C2H4O, 44.02585 Da) among PEGs n5-8.

553

PEG n5 was observed to have a positive connection to 2,3-dihydroxypropyl 12-

554

methyltrideacanote, an endogenous metabolite from the 12-methyltridecanoate fatty acid chain,

555

and a complex microbial-related metabolite in gastric cancer.53 Only high-molecular-weight
40

556

PEGs (> 400 Da, e.g., PEG n8) have shown toxic effects in animals54, and we were not able to

557

find any toxicity studies on the various PEGs. Another interesting correlation was observed

558

between a group of tertiary amine compounds, used as chemical intermediates/surfactants, with

559

a mass defect of -CH2- group (14.0115 Da), e.g., centrimonium and octadecanamine, and fatty

560

acid amide (oleamide) and bioactive lipid metabolites (d-sphingosine and r-palmitoyl-(2-

561

methyl) ethanolamide) (Figure 6). This suggests that these amine compounds might interfere

562

with lipid and fatty acid metabolism. This can be referenced by a relevant report indicating that

563

surfactants solubilize lipid membranes and transform them into lipid-surfactant micelles, while

564

fatty acids transform lipids into cubic and hexagonal phases.55 All these associations indicate

565

the potential direct or indirect intervention of exogenous contaminants on the metabolism

566

processes in human bodies.

567

This NTA analysis of urine and serum samples used full scan and MS/MS spectra match from

568

pooled samples by ddMS2 scan. Batch effects were significant but could be corrected by the

569

Combat package (Figure 2). This is consistent with previous study that found differences in

570

characteristics of LC/MS metabolomics data before batch correction.56, 57 The raw dataset

571

showed many features in blanks and field controls. Chemical features in QC samples showing

572

peak areas that were five times higher than those of the blanks. ESI+ and ESI- revealed the most

573

ions eluted from 10 to 20 min during chromatography (Figure S1). ESI+ covered a higher range

574

of charge-to-mass ratios at the beginning and end of the run. Only 344 features (~0.05% of the

575

merged features) were matched across ESI+ and ESI- datasets, highlighting varied chemical

576

properties in current samples.

577

In our dataset, most matched chemical features could not be fully confirmed without

578

analytical standards. The endogenous metabolites and exogenous contaminants groups had

579

significantly more compounds in them than drugs, natural products and personal care products

580

(Figure S3). Given the abundance of environmental contaminants and their observed

581

associations with endogenous metabolites, many of these contaminants could substantially

582

contribute to the exposome 58 disturb metabolic pathways such as lipid metabolism and

583

inflammation regulation.59

584

Our study provided a comprehensive non-targeted analysis of small molecules in serum and

585

urine samples from pregnant women, highlighting differences between sample types and

586

between preterm and term births. Approximately ~22% of features (Level ≥ 3) were tentatively

587

annotated by matching to spectral databases, and 12 chemicals were confirmed by authentic

588

standards. NTA is a critical tool in the assessment of a broad spectrum of environmentally-

589

concerned chemicals in biological samples. At present, there is a need for larger MSn databases

590

and analytical standards in order to increase the number of confirmed compounds.

591

5. Limitations and recommendations

592

While our study presents some evidence associating chemical exposures with preterm birth,

593

our study is not a comprehensive epidemiological study, but a human exposure study. Our main

594

goal was to identify new target chemicals and highlight them for further toxicity studies. We

595

have four limitations in our study that need to be acknowledged:

596
597

(1) We were limited to only 95 participants with paired urine and serum samples (including
35 pairs from preterm births).

598

(2) Although we observed clustering in the serum heatmap at a chemical detection frequency

599

cut-off of 70% (as well as at 60% and 80%, as shown in Figure 4a and Figure S11)
42

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zh59c ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-7520 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

600

between preterm and term births, we did not observe a similar pattern of chemical

601

enrichment in the paired urine samples across detection frequencies of 60-80% (Figure

602

4b and Figure S12). This discrepancy may be due to the different sampling times for

603

urine and the more pronounced matrix effects in urine.

604

(3) This study focused on environmental contaminants. We observed that numerous

605

annotated chemical features had a very low detection frequency. For example, among

606

the 344 annotated chemical features, 38 and 49 chemicals identified as exogenous

607

contaminants were detected in less than 60% of serum and urine samples, respectively.

608

This may suggest that serum is a more comprehensive matrix for detecting small

609

molecule contaminants.

610

(4) The analytical instrument presents challenges related to varying setting parameters

611

across different mass spectrometers and manufacturers, especially for soft ionization

612

techniques. In non-targeted analysis (NTA), the desired mass resolving power may not

613

be achieved for specific masses. For Orbitrap HRMS in NTA, the upper limit of mass

614

resolving power can lead to ion loss and dephasing of oscillations. The limited number

615

of ions per unit time entering the C-trap (AGC targets) could significantly affect the

616

sensitivity for small molecule chemicals with lower detection frequencies in our study.

617

We recommend multiple scans for pooled samples with a dynamic MS2 data window to

618

mitigate the limited AGC targets per scan. Additionally, it is advisable to combine

619

various analytical approaches to expand chemical space coverage, such as using GC

620

separation for volatile and highly nonpolar chemicals in conjunction with Quadrupole

621

Time-of-Flight (QTOF) MS.

Spreadsheet S1. 345 annotated chemical features, ranging from Level 1 (confirmed by authentic standards)
to Level 2 (tentatively annotated by MS1/MS2 database matches), were identified in both ESI+ and ESImodes. These features include those with the best match rates, and their frequency in urine/serum samples
from preterm and term births.
Spreadsheet S2. Quality control standards, including EPA phthalate esters mixtures and an in-house
analytical standards mixture, were used to assess the stability of the UHPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
for each batch. The evaluation included mass accuracy, retention time (RT) shifts, and r-values, all derived
from the average results across the four batches.
Spreadsheet S3. The chemical features were confirmed in our laboratory using authentic standards by
matching retention time (RT, min), MS1 (m/z), and MS2 (m/z).
Spreadsheet S4. The annotated chemicals that showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between preterm
and term birth samples were identified in the upregulated region (fold change > 1.2) and the downregulated
region (fold change < -1.2) of the volcano plot, in either serum or urine samples.

Text S1. The Creatinine normalization approach to diluted urine samples.
Urine samples can be diluted under various conditions, such as increased water intake or diuretic use.
According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) guidelines
(https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-21734), a urine sample is considered diluted if the creatinine
concentration is below 20 mg/dL. In our study, we used the creatinine normalization method, as employed
in similar research.1, 2 Based on the creatinine concentrations from 95 pregnant women in our study, we
established 25.22 mg/dL as the reference concentration for undiluted samples. For quantification, we
employed a six-point calibration curve ranging from 1 to 95 mg/dL, spiked with 50 µg/L of an internal
standard (creatinine-d3), using isotope dilution (with linearity > 0.99 for creatinine). Data acquisition and
processing were carried out with Xcalibur v. 4.3 (including Freestyle 1.6 and Quan browser). The chemical
abundances in diluted urine samples were adjusted using the following equation:

Chemical abundance after normalized creatinin = initial abundance ×

Reference Creatinine
Sample Creatinine
