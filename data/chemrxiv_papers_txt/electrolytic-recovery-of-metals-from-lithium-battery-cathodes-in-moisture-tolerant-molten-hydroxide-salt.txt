ABSTRACT
Lithium-ion battery recycling offers an opportunity to develop innovative technologies to close
the loop on the battery materials cycle and increase the resilience of the battery supply chain.
Here we demonstrate a two-step pyroelectrochemical method for producing mixed-metals from
lithium-ion cathodes in a molten hydroxide salt. Mixed metal oxides in the form of insoluble
lithium-ion cathode materials of LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 and spent lithium-ion battery materials
(black mass) were electrochemically reduced to a soluble form and dissolved into a molten
hydroxide salt bath. Electrochemical characterization of the process salt indicated accumulation
of dissolved transition metals in the salt. A separate cathode was used to produce alloys of Ni,
Mn, and Co electrochemically from the dissolved lithium-ion cathode materials. Characterization
by scanning electron microscopy fitted with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer showed
transition metals present in the cathode materials were recovered at the separate cathode. This
approach represents a scalable, low temperature pyroelectrochemical process that can potentially
reduce the cost and close the loop of battery cathode recycling.

1. INTRODUCTION
Demand for lithium-ion batteries and the critical metals (Li, Ni, and Co) from which they
are manufactured is increasing globally[1], with many countries increasing their demand as more
electric vehicles are purchased by consumers[2]. Recycling materials from spent batteries is a
potential route for meeting that demand[2]. Commercialized battery recycling processes are based
upon pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, or a combination of the two routes to recover critical
battery materials[3]. Existing commercial pyrometallurgical processes traditionally use high
temperatures (>1000 °C), which require high-purity reagents, and use coke as a reductant which
makes the process expensive and CO2-intensive[3]. We seek to develop a pyroelectrochemical
process that lowers the required temperatures and emissions needed for extraction of critical
materials from lithium-ion batteries with a smaller carbon footprint than conventional
pyrometallurgical routes. Here we demonstrate a pyroelectrochemical process that uses low
melting temperature, moisture-tolerant molten hydroxide salts to electrochemically produce metals
from lithium-ion batteries and the mixture of recycled battery materials called black mass.
Electrochemical routes for recovering metals from lithium-ion batteries are most often
developed for extraction of metals from hydrometallurgical solutions[4]. In contrast, there are a
small number of investigations into the direct extraction of metals from lithium-ion batteries and
these studies have been focused on the extraction of cobalt[5,6]. Molten salts have been used
extensively in the recovery of a variety of metals including lithium and may be a suitable
electrolyte to recover metals from lithium-ion batteries[7]. For recycling of lithium-ion batteries,
molten carbonate salts have been successfully employed to recover the Co present in LiCoO2[6],
but the operating temperature of these melts are high, approximately 750 °C, which increases the
costs associated with the molten carbonate process[6]. Alternative well-studied molten salts

(e.g.,LiCl-KCl, FLiNaK, CaCl2, etc.) that melt at lower temperatures are sensitive to potential
uncontrolled moisture impurities and may degrade in the presence of moisture (e.g., formation of
HF in molten fluoride salts[7]). Alternatively, LiCl has shown the capability to deoxygenate metal
oxides (electrochemically reduce) in the presence of moisture[8]. This process requires control of
the moisture content dissolved in the melt at temperatures higher than 600 °C to enable
deoxygenation of transition metal oxides by the production of reductive hydrogen at the surface of
the transition metal oxide[8].
Molten hydroxide salts are a moisture-tolerant, oxyanion conducting electrolyte system
suitable for electrochemical extraction[9]. This water tolerance is unique among molten salts and
enables electrochemistry with oxyanions through the Lux-Flood acid-base equilibrium:
2OH- ↔ H2O + O2-

(1)

in which water is the oxoacid and accepts oxyanions to form the hydroxide ion. This reaction
allows for electrochemistry of oxides to be performed in hydroxide melts. For example, pure
molten NaOH has been used to electrochemically deoxygenate transition metals[10–13] and
molten LiOH-KOH has been used as a solvent media to electrochemically deposit LiCoO2 and
LiMnO2 [14]. The deoxygenation of metals and electrodeposition of lithiated transition metal
oxides (lithium-ion cathode material) in molten hydroxide salts suggests that lithium-ion battery
cathodes can be electrochemically deoxygenated to extract precious transition metals using molten
hydroxide salts. However, the decomposition of dissolved moisture limits the cathodic polarization
of the salt preventing efficient deposition of metal from the salt [14], necessitating methods to deal
with moisture impurities in order to effectively produce metals from the melt. Furthermore, black
mass contains additional impurities such as copper, aluminum, and carbon from current collectors
and binders that would need to be tolerated. Here, we present our pyroelectrochemical approach

for electroreducing and extracting metals from lithium-ion battery cathodes and black mass using
the LiOH-KOH eutectic under both moist and dehydrated conditions.
2.EXPERIMENTAL
All tests were performed in a stainless-steel vacuum test chamber placed within a Ventura
melt bench top furnace. Cathode materials tested were LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC 622, Targray)
or black mass provided by ReCell. The black mass contained 2.16 wt % Al, 6.37 wt % Co, 3.85
wt % Cu, 0.19 wt % Fe, 3.46 wt % Li, 6.01 wt % Mn, 0.03 wt % Na, 16.79 wt % Ni, 0.35 wt % P,
0.25 wt % S based upon elemental characterization provided by ReCell. Test pellets of NMC622
were fabricated by hydraulically pressing NMC622 powder at 3 tons of pressure and then calcining
for 5 h at 825 °C. No binder was added to the NMC622. Black mass electrodes were pressed at 3
tons of pressure and were not further heated as they were mechanically robust as-pressed.
The experimental setup is shown schematically in Figure 1 and consisted of an alumina
crucible containing LiOH-KOH eutectic synthesized from anhydrous 99.9 % LiOH and 99.98 %
trace metals KOH for the NMC622 tests and from anhydrous 98 % LiOH and 85 % KOH for the
black mass tests. An electrolyte of LiOH-KOH was chosen due to its low melting temperature
eutectic (225 °C) [15], capability for production of insoluble lithiated transition metal oxides [14],
inherent moisture tolerance, and potential for the recovery of Li metal using electrolysis [16].
Working electrodes consisted of a tungsten wire, tungsten rod, stainless-steel plate, or a stainlesssteel basket filled with calcined LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) or black mass pellets. A graphite
rod served as counter electrode, and a tungsten wire served as a quasi-reference electrode as no
well-characterized reference electrode exists at present for molten LiOH-KOH salts. The loaded
test vessel was sealed within an inert atmosphere glovebox (maintained at < 0.1 ppm O2 and < 0.5
ppm H2O), removed, and transferred to a bench top furnace. The assembled cell was dried under

a vacuum of 120 millitorr at either 200 °C or 280 °C overnight before testing under an ultra-high
purity argon purge atmosphere. Temperature was monitored using a K-Type thermocouple placed
external to the crucible at the salt level. The temperature of the test vessel was maintained at 280
± 5°C during experimentation. The electrochemical cells were controlled by a Gamry Interface
5000E potentiostat. Recovered products from the cathode basket were imaged and characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (Hiatchi 3400 with Bruker Nano GmbH XFlash detector 610)
with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).

3.RESULTS
3.1 Electrolyte Selection and Treatment
Although molten hydroxide salts are tolerant to moisture, the presence of moisture limits the
control of electrochemical reactions as the decomposition of water is the typical cathodic limit to
the electrochemical window. As such, three methods to dry the salt were evaluated: by first drying
a test salt as a solid at 200 °C, by drying the salt in the liquid state at 280 °C, and by drying the
salt electrolytically. Electrochemical investigation was performed using a tungsten wire to evaluate
the changes to the moisture content under the three drying conditions. The cyclic voltammogram
(CV) in Figure 2a for the solid drying (red) has an anodic feature associated with the dissolution
of tungsten (Feature 1, approximately 0.1 V vs. W wire) and a large cathodic feature (2,
approximately -0.25 V vs. W wire) indicative of the decomposition of the dissolved water [14,17].
The salt used in a second cell was dried by placing the salt under vacuum, then melting the salt
under vacuum and leaving it overnight. CVs obtained in the liquid-dried melt (Figure 2a, black
curve) show the current of the water decomposition feature is significantly decreased (Feature 2,
Figure 2a) and an additional cathodic feature (Feature 3, Figure 2a, black curve) is revealed and is
likely correlated with the production of alkali metal. If we consider the formation energy, ΔGf, of
the constituent salt hydroxides then the deposited alkali metal is likely K as the formation energy
of KOH (K + 0.25 O2 + 0.5 H2O = KOH, ΔGf = -231.2 kJ mol-1 at 280 °C) is less negative (less
electrochemically stable) than the LiOH (Li + 0.25 O2 + 0.5 H2O = LiOH, ΔGf = -290.8 kJ mol-1
at 280 °C) [15]. Empirical identification of the alkali metal generated was not performed in the
course of this work.
A separate test was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of electrolysis as a method for
removing moisture from the melt. Electrolysis is an industrially relevant process that may be a

more attractive treatment method for drying hydroxide salts than using a vacuum. Electrolysis was
tested by subjecting a solid-dried LiOH-KOH melt to 6 Ah of electrolysis at 500 mA through two
graphite electrodes. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) performed with a 1 A cut-off current
before and after electrolysis are shown in Figure 2b. The current of the reaction associated with
dissolved moisture (Feature 2, Figure 2b) decreased in magnitude and the alkali metal production
reaction (Feature 3, Figure 2b) was achieved during LSVs after the 6 Ah electrolysis test. The
dissolved moisture undergoes the following reaction mechanism at the cathode during
electrolysis[18]:
2H2O + 2e- → 2OH- + H2

(2)

The hydroxide anions react at the anode to form gaseous oxygen and steam through the
following reaction[18]:
6OH- → 3H2O + 1.5O2 + 6e-

(3)

Anodically generated moisture may re-dissolve into the melt and lower the overall efficiency of
removing moisture by electrolysis. However, our results show that there is a net moisture decrease
in the melt and that it is possible to eliminate moisture by electrolysis.

3.2 Electrolysis of NMC 622 under moist and dry conditions
The electrolysis was performed to assess the recovery of metal from lithium-ion cathode
materials. Electrochemical characterization of the cathode materials and the salt was performed in
both moist and dry electrolytes using calcined NMC622 charged in a stainless-steel basket to
enhance electrical contact with the cathode basket and tungsten electrodes. Figure 3a shows cyclic
voltammograms (CVs) of a NMC622 charged basket in moist and dried electrolyte overlain. The
moist electrolyte shows the onset of a cathodic reaction at approximately -0.2 V vs. W wire, similar
to what was observed in a moist melt on a tungsten wire (Figure 2a, red curve). CVs of the dried
electrolyte show additional cathodic features at approximately -0.4 V vs. W wire and a rapid
increase in current at potentials more negative than -0.56 V vs. W wire. The reaction at
approximately -0.2 V vs. W wire in the moist salt is the reduction of moisture on the steel basket
whereas the more negative features are associated with the reduction of the NMC622 material.
Electrolysis was performed with the calcined NMC622 pellets in moist and dry electrolytes
and the results are shown in Figure 3b and Figure 3c, respectively. During electrolysis, the potential
measured in the moist electrolyte is noisy. This is a characteristic feature of gas evolution reactions
and is expected as hydrogen gas is produced during water reduction (Reaction 2). The pellet in dry
electrolyte was held at -1.4 V vs. W wire to perform the NMC622 reduction but prevent the
formation of excess alkali metal. A CV performed before and after electrolysis on a tungsten
electrode in a dry salt shows an increase in the current associated with the moisture reduction
(Feature 2, Figure 3d) of the salt due to Reaction 3 occurring at the anode during electrolysis of
the NMC622 pellet. Several additional features (Features 4–7, Figure 3d) appear at voltages more
negative of the reduction potential of dissolved moisture and the -0.56 V vs. W wire feature of the
bulk NMC622 from Figures 3a, indicating NMC622 reduced to a soluble form during electrolysis.

Figure 4a–c shows photographs of the as-calcined material prior to testing, after immersion
in the melt for 16 hours, and after electrolysis, respectively. The photographs show the calcined
pellet was only minimally deformed during immersion, but significantly deformed during
electrolysis. This suggests that electrolysis greatly affects the structure of the calcined pellet and
electrolysis may promote dissolution into the melt.

Characterization of electrolysis products recovered from cathode baskets were performed
and compared to commercial powdered NMC622 (Figure 5a). The electrolysis in dry electrolyte
partially dissolved the NMC622 particle (Figure 5b), where the boundary between the dissolved
and undissolved particle is marked by the red arrow. The EDS maps shown in Figure 5b confirms
that the undissolved part of the particle still contains significant oxygen content and was not
reduced to metal. Electrolysis in moist electrolyte led to the recovery of partially reduced NMC622
particles (Figure 5c) from the cathode basket after electrolysis. The recovered NMC622 are more
porous in appearance than the feedstock NMC622. The EDS maps in Figure 5c show low

concentrations of oxygen in the recovered particulate. The electrolyte was examined before (Figure
6a) and after (Figure 6b) electrolysis with dry electrolytes and NMC622. The electrolyte changed
colors from white to green indicating that some transition metals had dissolved into the melt during
electrolysis. Similar observations occurred in both moist and dry conditions in this work.
Furthermore, Zhang et al., observed a similar phenomenon. Their LiOH-KOH melt turned blue
when soluble CoO was introduced and complexed as Co(OH)42-[14].

The observed dissolution of the lithiated transition metal oxides occurs due to an insolublesoluble transition. Here, the insoluble cathode material dissolves (solubilizes) into the melt under
reducing electrochemical conditions, shown in Reaction (4) for a generic lithiated oxide; any
lithium-ion cathode will likely reduce by this mechanism:
LiAO2(s) + e- → Li+ + O2- + AO (sol)

(4)

Where A is a transition metal (Ni, Mn, Co). The reduction process liberates the Li+ and O2- ions
into the melt, while reducing the transition metal from 3+ to 2+ which is soluble in the melt[14].
The accumulated O2- is then discharged at the anode as gaseous oxygen and steam through
Reactions 1 and 3. The 2+ valence transition metal may also oxidize at the anode to a soluble or
insoluble 3+ compound depending on moisture content and the transition metal of interest. For
example Zhang et al., observed anodic LiCoO2 deposition from moist salts and speculated that
Co3O4 may anodically deposit but would be unstable in moist salts[14]. This may lower the
overall efficiency of the metal recovery but further investigation into the electrochemical
behavior of the individual dissolved transition metals is necessary and beyond the scope of the
current work. The recovery of metallic particles in Figure 5c from cathode baskets in moist
electrolytes suggests that the reduction of moisture to hydrogen at the surface of the NMC622
pellet further reduces some of the partially dissolved particles to their metallic form while
accumulating the excess metal oxide materials (e.g., CoO and MnO) into the melt.
The solubilized metal oxides can be recovered electrolytically on a separate cathode. The
recovery of the solubilized transition metal oxides as metal alloys in both moist and dry electrolyte
was tested by electrolysis after reducing 2 g of NMC622 into the melt. A steel plate was used as
the cathode for tests in dry salts and a tungsten rod was used for tests in moist salts, both were
discharged at -2 A to electrolyze metals. The electrochemical signal for electrolysis is shown in

Figure 7a for the steel plate and Figure 7b for the tungsten rod. The average electrolysis potential
for the steel plate was approximately -0.9 and for the tungsten rod was approximately -1.1 V vs W
wire. Both were more negative than the moisture decomposition reaction, indicating removing
moisture may not be necessary to recover metals from the melt but the presence of moisture may
decrease the efficiency of the metals extraction.
Figure 7c is the SEM photomicrograph of the dry salt electrolysis product and the EDS
mapping for the sample. The backscattered electron photomicrograph shows bright fine metallic
needles (Figure 7c, red arrow) with significant entrained salt surrounding the needles (Figure 7c,
blue arrow). The EDS spectra show nickel, cobalt, and manganese were recovered as fine needles
with significant oxygen present due to the entrained salt and high surface area of the fine metallic
particles. Figure 7d shows the SEM photomicrograph and EDS spectra of the electrolysis product
on a tungsten electrode from a moist electrolyte, respectively. The product morphology was fine
and contained nickel, cobalt, and manganese from the NMC622 and oxygen due to the fine
morphology of the metallic particles. Optimization of deposition parameters such as applied
potential and current density will be necessary moving forward to obtain value added alloy
materials.

3.3 Extraction of transition metals in the presence of impurities from black mass
A pyroelectrochemical recycling process using molten hydroxide salt would be required to
function in the presence of impurities associated with black mass materials. The reductionelectrolysis was performed with black mass acquired from ReCell to test the applicability of
molten hydroxides for reduction-electrolysis using real spent battery materials. Lower purity LiOH
and KOH were selected for the black mass demonstration to reflect purities that are relevant for
scale-up. Figure 8a and 8b show a pressed black mass pellet before and after electrolysis in a dry
low purity melt, respectively. The black mass pellet lost its structure like the NMC622 pellet
(Figure 4c) and the electrolyte changed from white to black (Figure 8c) during testing due to the
accumulation of soluble species or fine carbon particles from the black mass electrode. Figure 8d
shows the electrochemical response of a stainless-steel cathode basket containing a black mass
pellet discharged at -0.25 A to prevent the potentials from rapidly reaching the alkali metal
production potentials (-1.4 V vs. W wire). The potential measurements of the black mass shows
three distinct regions numbered 1, 2, and 3 with their boundaries marked by blue vertical lines.
The first region has an average potential of about -0.72 V vs. W wire, the potentials of the second
region become more negative from -0.72 to -1.23 V vs. W wire, and the potentials of the third
region decreases to a minimum potential of -1.8 V vs. W wire. We speculate that the reactions
occurring in region 1 correspond to the reactions 4 and 5 presented in Figure 3d, the reactions in
region 2 correspond to reactions 6 and 7 in Figure 3d, and the reactions in region 3 correspond to

surface of the cathode. A SEM photomicrograph in Figure 9c shows the recovered product and
the EDS X-ray mapping associated with it. The recovered product formed a plate structure and
contained the metals Ni, Mn, Co, as well as Al and Cu metals from processed current collectors.
Further investigation and optimization of the deposition parameters (i.e., current density,
potentials) is necessary to control the metal alloy product composition and morphology.
Nonetheless we have demonstrated that metals present as oxides or concomitantly in the battery
recycling process can be recovered on a separate reducing cathode for further processing.
Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated that molten hydroxide salts can be used to deposit
Na-ion battery materials[19] by a similar mechanism as Li-ion battery materials[14], meaning
that an appropriately designed molten hydroxide salt system could produce metal from both
lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries as feedstock.

Conclusions
Electrolysis in a molten LiOH-KOH electrolyte was carried out to reduce NMC622 and
black mass to metal constituents. We showed that NMC622 and black mass undergo an electrolytic
reduction to a soluble form in both moist and dry melts. Further testing indicated recovery of
leached cathode material electrolytically as an alloy at a separate cathode. A large electrochemical
feature associated with the decomposition of the salt (reduction of alkali ions to metal) suggests
molten hydroxide salts can function as a one-pot process to recover all the transition metals from
spent lithium-ion battery cathodes. Future testing will focus on identifying the alkali metal
reduction, recovery efficiency of the metals, and selective separation of the transition metals during
electrolysis. Our data suggest that pyroelectrochemical processing of cathode materials in molten
LiOH-KOH salts may be a viable method to recover valuable metal components at temperatures
and carbon emissions that are lower than conventional high temperature pyroprocessing of battery
cathodes. Furthermore, the use of molten hydroxides to deoxygenate transition metals suggests
that electrometallurgical processing of other battery cathode materials (e.g., LiFePO4, Na-ion
batteries, etc) in hydroxide salts is possible. Further optimization of this method may make
pyroprocessing of battery cathode materials more economically viable and close the lifecycle of
battery cathode materials.
