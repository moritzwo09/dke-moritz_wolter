Abstract
We report the infrared photodissociation spectrum of tagged protonated valine in the range 1000
‚Äì 1900 cm-1, prepared in a cryogenic ion trap. Comparison of experimental results with calculated
infrared spectra based on density functional theory shows that the hydroxyl group of the carboxylic
acid functionality and the protonated amine group adopt a trans configuration. Nitrogen and
methane molecules were used as messenger tags, with optimal tagging temperatures of 30 K for
N2 and 60 K for CH4. While the calculated infrared spectra of the tagged ion suggest only a weak
influence of the messenger tag on the frequency positions of ValH+, the measured intensities for
N2-tagged ValH+ are strongly suppressed for all but the highest frequency features at 1773 cm-1.
We trace this behavior to the binding energy of the N2 tag, which is significantly higher than that
of CH4, based on CCSD(T) calculations and rate estimates for photoinduced unimolecular
dissociation from statistical theory.

Introduction
The search for chemical markers of life or of prebiotic conditions supporting the development
of life is at the forefront of astrobiology. Radio astronomy and infrared (IR) spectroscopy have led
to the discovery of numerous molecular species1 in the interstellar medium, as well as in the
outflow of carbon rich stars, and much hope rests on future detection of biomarkers by the James
Webb Space Telescope.2 Closer to home, one of the most promising avenues for the detection and
analysis of complex molecules that can serve as biomarkers is through planetary probes on worlds
in our own solar system. Using terrestrial biology as a starting point, suitable biomarkers include
simple amino acids, nucleobases, sugars, or fatty acids, and candidate worlds range from planets
like Mars to planetary moons and planetoids, especially icy worlds with a subsurface aqueous
ocean such as Titan, Enceladus, or Europa.
Mass spectrometry provides a powerful approach for the detection of polyatomic molecules,
and it has been or will be used on several planetary missions,3-5 e.g., on the Viking lander (Mars),
Curiosity rover (Mars), Rosetta/Philae Lander (Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet), and the planned
Rosalind Franklin rover (Mars), and Dragonfly rotorcraft (Titan).

However, while mass

spectrometers with sufficient resolution can distinguish between ions with very similar masses,
e.g., N2+ (28.0134 u) and CO+ (28.0101 u), mass spectrometry alone is insufficient to identify a
molecular ion that could have different structures with the same atomic composition. Using valine
(Val, C5H11NO2) as an example, the NIST chemistry webbook6 identifies more than 30 unique
compounds with the same atomic composition, but distinct structure, out of which only valine is a
proteinogenic amino acid. Consequently, additional information is required for the unambiguous
identification of more complex molecular biomarkers, such as amino acids. Fragmentation patterns
from collision induced dissociation experiments can narrow down the candidates for a given

molecular ion, which have very different functional groups (e.g., amino acids and nitrites), but
such fragmentation patterns depend significantly on the experimental details. Alternatively,
instrumentation operating in concert with mass spectrometry may offer additional information. For
example, ion mobility front ends can bring additional structural information. However, ion
mobility ultimately only yields a single data point, namely the orientation-averaged collision cross
section of the ion in question, and ion mobility collision cross sections may be ambiguous.
Chromatography front ends are complex, and standardization of elution presents significant
engineering challenges. Additional channels of information are desirable to unambiguously
identify the molecular structure of ions detected in mass spectrometry instruments on planetary
missions.
Infrared spectroscopy of mass selected ions in concert with quantum chemical calculations
has been shown to be a valuable tool to determine the molecular structure of ions in vacuo, and it
has been used extensively in the study of biomolecules.7-28 With its power to encode molecular
structure, IR spectroscopy can offer an approach towards unambiguous identification of complex
molecular ions, including isomers of valine with similar functional groups (see Supporting
Information, Figure S1). Libraries of laboratory spectra are needed to make such identifications
possible for a large variety of possible biomarkers. While the spectra of several protonated8, 11-13,
15-18, 20, 23

and deprotonated22 amino acids have been measured at room temperature using IR

multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), much fewer IR spectroscopy data exist on cryogenically
prepared amino acid ions14, 27-28 outside of peptides containing several amino acid residues.
Cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy (CIVS) allows the use of single photon dissociation
by employing weakly bound messenger tags (e.g., H2, D2, N2), yielding IR photodissociation
spectra that correspond closely to the absorption spectra of the target ions, typically with linewidths

that are narrow compared to many IRMPD signatures at room temperature and with only small
tag-induced shifts. The technique is in principle compatible with trap-based mass spectrometry
technology employed on planetary probes. However, the usable temperature range for a given
messenger tag is typically relatively narrow, (e.g., 10-15 K for D2, 25-40 K for N2), and the tagging
temperatures are often significantly lower than the temperatures of target worlds on which CIVS
might be employed (e.g., 46 ‚Äì 96 K on Europa29; 33 ‚Äì 145 K on Enceladus30; 110 ‚Äì 235 K on
Ceres31; 95 K on Titan32). Active cooling would introduce additional electrical power requirements
as well as weight, which is difficult within the typical limitations on both resources on planetary
probes. For the prospect of using CIVS on such missions it is therefore desirable to find suitable
alternative tags which can function at higher temperatures.
In this work, we use CIVS to measure the IR fingerprint spectra of protonated Val (ValH+),
supported by density functional theory (DFT). We provide an experimental case study on
distinguishing different constitutional isomers, comparing the experimental spectrum of ValH+,
with DFT calculated spectra of potential isomers. We compare messenger tagging of ValH+ with
N2 and CH4, both in terms of optimal tagging temperatures and photodissociation efficiency.

Methods
The experimental setup has been described in earlier work.33 Briefly, we prepared protonated
molecular species by electrospray ionization (ESI) of a 1 mM solution of L-Val (Sigma-Aldrich)
in 2:1 acetonitrile (ACN, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and water, with drops of hydrochloric acid
(HCl, Mallinckrodt Chemicals) added until the solution was at a pH of 2. Ions passed through a
heated desolvation capillary (80 ÔÇ∞C) and a skimmer into a series of octopole ion guides and ion
optics, which transferred the ions into a Paul trap mounted on a closed cycle He cryostat. In the

trap, the ions were accumulated, cooled, and tagged with a single N2 tag or a single CH4 tag during
a period of 100 ms or 50 ms per experimental cycle, respectively. For methane tagging, neat CH4
was used as the buffer gas, and the optimal trap temperature for tagging was ca. 60 K. The resulting
pressure of CH4 in the trap can be estimated as ca. 2Íûè10-3 mbar. For N2 tagging, we used residual
N2 from the ESI source inlet with 10% D2 in He as the buffer gas in the trap, and the trap was held
at ca. 30 K. As a result, the partial pressure of N2 in the trap is more difficult to quantify, although
the overall pressure in the trap is of the same order of magnitude as for methane buffer gas. The
temperatures reported here are the average of two temperature probes, one at the top of the trap
near the cold head and one at the bottom of the trap. The difference between the two probes is 1215 K.
The contents of the ion trap were injected into the acceleration region of a time-of-flight
mass spectrometer, and target ions ValH+Íûètag were subsequently mass-selected in the first space
focus using an interleaving comb mass gate and irradiated with the output of a tunable OPO/OPA
(LaserVision). Photofragments of ValH+ following the reaction

were separated from undissociated parent ions in a two-stage reflectron, and the photofragment
ion intensity was monitored as a function of IR wavelength on a microchannel plate detector. Ion
signals from sixteen shots were averaged for each wavelength in each scan. Background signals
from unimolecular dissociation caused by collisional activation during ion ejection from the trap
were negligible for ions tagged with N2. For CH4 tagging, only every other ion package was
irradiated, and the signals with and without irradiation were subtracted. Multiple spectra taken
over several days were averaged for each species to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to ensure
reproducibility. Spectra were taken in the fingerprint region (1100 ‚Äì 1900 cm-1) and calibrated to

the known spectrum of acetone34 using a photoacoustic cell, and we assume the calibration to be
accurate to within 3 cm-1. We note that photodissociation signals were low for ValH+ÍûèN2, resulting
in a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, despite the fact that the spectra we report represent the
average of at least 50 scans.
Structures of the species under study were calculated using DFT,35 beginning with several
starting structures for each ion. We employed the B3LYP functional36-37 and cc-pVTZ basis sets3839

for all atoms. For each minimum energy structure of protonated valine, the IR spectrum was

calculated based on the harmonic approximation, scaling the frequencies by 0.9889, using a
comparison of calculated and experimental data found for the antisymmetric OCO stretching
vibration of the carboxylic acid group of protonated alanine.28 In all calculated spectra, vibrational
lines are shown as Lorentzians with 8 cm-1 full width at half-maximum.
Binding energies of the tags were calculated with the same method as the geometry
optimization, applying the counterpoise method40-41 to correct basis set superposition errors. In
addition, we used the optimized geometries from the DFT calculations to determine binding
energies at the CCSD42 and CCSD(T)43-44 levels of theory with cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets3839

for the former and cc-pVDZ for the latter. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian

16 program suite.45

Results and Discussion
In order to form a complex of a neutral messenger tag and ValH+, the trap temperature must be
chosen to create optimal conditions regarding the vapor pressure and binding energy of the tag. If
the trap is too warm, the complex will have sufficient internal energy to induce loss of the tag. If
the trap is too cold, the gaseous tag will have insufficient vapor pressure to efficiently form the

N2 and CH4 tags. The temperature range for tagging of ValH+ with N2 is 20-65 K with an optimum
at ca. 30 K. For CH4 tags the optimal temperature range is 50-75 K with an optimum at ca. 60 K.

Protonated valine, ValH+, has several possible conformations, which can be roughly classified
by the position of the protonated amine group relative (cis or trans) to the OH group of the COOH
carboxylic acid moiety (Figure 2). As one would expect, the lowest energy structure has a trans
configuration (trans-1), which is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) to
the carboxylic acid group. This structure is significantly lower in energy (by 191 meV) than the
lowest energy cis (cis-1) configuration, which lacks this stabilization. There are overall three lowlying trans configurations of ValH+ (trans-2 at 56 meV and trans-3 at 70 meV higher than trans1), which have different orientations of the two methyl groups relative to the NH3+ and COOH

groups. We note that similar low-lying conformers were found in earlier computational work by
Quesada-Moreno et al.46 The geometries discussed there were calculated for different protonation
states of valine embedded in a polarizable continuum, which explains the differences compared to
the gas phase structures in the present work.

The IR photodissociation spectra of ValH+ÍûèN2 and ValH+ÍûèCH4 are shown in Figure 3, together
with the calculated IR spectra of the lowest energy trans and cis structures of ValH+. Consistent
with the energetic ordering, the experimental spectrum is more consistent with the calculated
spectra for a trans configuration than with a cis structure. Based on the calculated spectrum of the
lowest energy isomer (trans-1), we assign the most intense transition (labeled a in Figure 3) around

1775 cm-1 to the antisymmetric OCO stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, which is
coupled to an HNC bending motion of the H-bonded NH group. A weak, broad peak around 1585
cm-1 (b) can be assigned to two NH3+ scissoring modes. Another weak peak at 1478 cm-1 (c)
contains several unresolved transitions characterized by CH3 scissoring modes. The prominent
feature at ca. 1444 cm-1 (d) is mostly due to the NH3+ umbrella motion. This pattern of motion also
contributes to the peak at ca. 1415 cm-1 (e) which is mainly carried by a HOC bending and
symmetric OCO stretching motion of the COOH group. We assign the weak feature at 1355 cm-1
(f) to a CCH bending motion of the two CH groups attached to the carbon atoms of the central C‚Äì
C bond. The peak at ca. 1170 cm-1 (g) belongs to a mode mainly due to OH bending motion, while
the peak around 1125 cm-1 (h) comes from two modes displaying CH3/NH3+ tilting motions, and
feature (i) at ca. 1080 cm-1 can be traced to similar motions. The simulated spectra of the different
trans isomers show subtle differences (see Supporting Information, Figure S2), and most key
features are sufficiently similar that it is challenging to distinguish between them
spectroscopically. However, the signatures between 1100 cm-1 and 1200 cm-1 (in particular feature
h) suggest that the lowest energy isomer (trans-1) is indeed the isomer populated in the experiment.
Tags generally bind to an ion in the vicinity of the charge center, and usually have only small
effects on the structure and spectrum. Consistent with this expectation, exploratory calculations
show that the tags bind close to the NH3+ group. Table 1 summarizes the frequency positions of
each feature for the two tags used here. For the lowest energy conformation of the tags, there is no
significant change in the structure of the ValH+ ion (see Supporting Information, Figures S3 and
S4), and only small changes in its IR frequencies (Table 1).

However, an overall absence of tagging effects on the spectrum cannot be taken for granted. A
conformation with an N2 tag binding in a slightly different position, 59 meV higher in energy (see
Supporting Information, Figure S4), is predicted to result in a blue shift of the OCO stretching
feature by 10 cm-1, and even an altered intensity pattern in the NH3+ umbrella region. This structure
is higher in energy because the tag interferes with the intramolecular H-bond, destabilizing the
complex. Since the overall experimental band pattern in the NH3+ umbrella region matches the
calculated patterns of the untagged trans structures, we judge that this tag position is not
significantly populated.

The vibrational signatures of the CH4 tag itself are found at 1293 cm-1 and 1324 cm-1,
respectively, and they represent different CH3 umbrella modes of the tag. The N2 stretching
frequency is predicted to be at 2431 cm-1, which is outside the frequency range reported here.
A much more dramatic influence of the tag is seen in the relative intensities for the experimental
IR spectra. While the relative intensities in the spectrum of ValH+ÍûèCH4 are consistent with the
calculated pattern, the intensities for ValH+ÍûèN2 show a pronounced dependence on frequency, with
the lower frequency modes having significantly lower relative intensities than calculated. We trace
this behavior to the tag binding energies. The binding energy of the N2 tag is calculated to be
significantly higher than the CH4 tag (see Table 2), with binding energies of the former in the range
of the photon energies in the present work, while the latter was calculated on average 500 cm-1
lower than for N2, closer to the low energy end of the spectral range discussed here.

Tagged ValH+ ions spend roughly 20 ÔÅ≠s between photon absorption and entry into the reflectron.

where E is the total internal energy of the complex, s is the reaction degeneracy (here taken to be
1), ùëÅ ‚Ä° ùê∏ is the sum of vibrational states at the transition state, h is Planck‚Äôs constant, and ùúå ùê∏
is the vibrational density of states of the reactant complex. Since we cannot measure actual
dissociation rate constants, we chose several approximations to simplify the calculation of the sum
and density of states: (i) all vibrational modes are treated as harmonic oscillators; (ii) we assume
a tight transition state by identifying a single vibration of the reactant complex (calculated at 106
cm-1) as a reaction coordinate that most closely resembles dissociation of the complex; (iii) the
methyl groups are treated as hindered rotors in a 3-fold well to better represent their degeneracy
(g = 3), but the level spacing was still chosen to be harmonic; (iv) similar to (iii), the internal
rotations of the N2 tag were treated as hindered rotors in a double well, resulting in a degeneracy
g = 2. These simplifications allowed us to estimate the sums and densities of states using a simple
Beyer-Swinehart algorithm.51
In addition to the energy of the absorbed photon, the ions have an internal energy based on
their microcanonical temperature prior to photon absorption. In previous work,52 we estimated that
the ions prepared at ca. 30 K trap temperature will have microcanonical temperatures of ca. 65 K.

Where the sum runs over all vibrational frequencies, resulting in internal energies of 150 cm-1 for
N2-tagged ions, which we simply add to the photon energy ‚Ñéùúà to arrive at the total energy after
photon absorption. For CH4-tagged ions, the higher temperature of the trap increases the estimated
ion temperature to 95 K, which results in internal energies of ca. 365 cm-1 prior to photon
absorption. If the total energy (ùëà

‚Ñéùúà) is below the calculated dissociation energy E0, we

expect no dissociation to occur. Above this threshold, the characteristic time scales for dissociation
depend on the photon energy and can be longer than the experimental observation time of 20 ÔÅ≠s
in our setup. For ValH+ÍûèN2, significant suppression of the photodissociation quantum yield can be
expected for photon energies as high as 1735 cm-1 (see Supporting Information, Figure S5) based
on the calculated binding energies shown in Table 2. In the spectrum of ValH+ÍûèN2, feature (b) at
1580 cm-1 is significantly suppressed compared to the same feature in the spectrum of ValH+ÍûèCH4
(Figure 3), consistent with a binding energy of the N2 tag around 1600 cm-1 or higher. The lack of
any apparent suppression of signals for the CH4 tag in the spectral range considered here is
consistent with significantly lower binding energies (see Table 2 and Supporting Information,
Figure S5) as well as higher internal energy contents of the tagged ion due to the higher trap
temperature.
Based on the calculated binding energies and the RRKM estimates, we judge that N2 binds
sufficiently strongly to the ion to suppress the photodissociation quantum yield at photon energies
significantly below the feature of the antisymmetric OCO stretching vibration. The residual
fragment ion yield at low photon energies is likely caused by a fraction of the ion population that
are incompletely thermalized, or which are collisionally excited below the threshold for
dissociation during ejection from the ion trap. In contrast, tagging with CH4 does not lead to
suppression of the photodissociation quantum yield in the fingerprint region. We note that ‚Äì

although this is not the subject of the present work ‚Äì tagging with D2 seems to have not led to
significant suppression of the photodissociation quantum yield in work on protonated amino acids
by Garand and coworkers down to 1400 cm-1.
Coming back to the motivation for this work, the choice of the best tag will depend on several
factors. The photodissociation quantum yield of the tag in the relevant frequency range is of
obvious importance for the signal-to-noise ratio and the faithful representation of the IR absorption
spectrum in the photodissociation channel. Out of the currently known tags for protonated amino
acids, this consideration favors the use of D2 or CH4, although there should be no problems
associated with N2 tags for work in the CH and OH stretching range (above ca. 2700 cm-1). Even
water as a ‚Äútag‚Äù, which can be used at trap temperatures in the range of 80 ‚Äì 185 K,27 may work
in this spectral region,11, 13, 53 although the presence of a water adduct may change the spectrum of
the biomarker considerably. For an instrument on a planetary probe, a very important consideration
is the temperature of the target environment. Since heating and cooling can be energy and weight
intensive, the optimal tagging temperature should be as close to the target environment as possible.
This excludes D2, and even N2 will be impractical to use on most target worlds (see Introduction).
Depending on the exact region on a world like Europa or Enceladus, CH4 shows the most promise
of the tags studied so far, although Ceres and Titan will likely be too warm. It would be
advantageous to study additional tags, such as CF4 or CH3CN, for their potential use at higher
temperatures.

Conclusions
We present CIVS to measure the IR fingerprint spectra of protonated Val (ValH+), comparing
the experimental spectra of ValH+ tagged with N2 and CH4. Based on the calculated spectra of

potential conformers, we find that the trans conformer dominates the population, consistent with
the fact that it is calculated to be lowest in energy. The different tags have only a small influence
on most of the vibrational energies, but N2 has a much higher binding energy than CH4. As a result,
the photodissociation efficiency for ValH+ÍûèN2 is strongly suppressed for all but the highest energy
feature in the spectrum at 1773 cm-1, consistent with simple RRKM calculations. Interestingly,
this observation may make N2 a more generally unattractive tag for CIVS of protonated amino
acids in the lower energy part of the fingerprint region. In contrast, CH4, which can be used at
higher trap temperatures (we found 60 K to be optimal) without introducing significant
broadening, making it a suitable tag for applications of CIVS with protonated amino acids,
particularly in experiments that require trap temperatures above 50 K. For example, the use of CH4
tags would allow application of messenger tagging on planetary missions to target worlds such as
Europa or Enceladus.
