Abstract
This mini-review highlights how many of the principles of green chemistry can be used to make
polymers more sustainable. The use of renewable feedstocks has grown enormously in recent
years including use of bio-derived monomers and modifications of natural polymers such as
carbohydrates. Polymers are also being designed to allow entry into the circular economy
especially where triggered depolymerization (e.g. catalytic recycling to monomer) can occur,
which can allow easy separation from other plastics in a mixed waste stream. Computational
studies and reaction monitoring are useful in identifying and understanding reactivity trends for
polymer synthesis and degradation. Solvent-free reactions, including mechanochemistry, can
be employed to reduce process mass intensity and environmental impacts. Use of standard
polymer degradation conditions (e.g. ISO standards) and life cycle assessments, in particular hot
spot analyses, should be encouraged in order to accelerate progress in this important field.

Introduction

Chemists worldwide celebrated the 25th anniversary of the principles of green chemistry in
2023 and even though progress has been made, system-wide changes are needed.[1-3] Jessop
and MacDonald have recently emphasized the role that hotspot-driven research can play in
accelerating the rate at which improvements can be made.[4] This approach, which can be used
to identify and select research projects, could be applied to ‘green’ polymer chemistry by
highlighting the most harmful stage in a polymer’s life cycle. Green Chemistry had its roots in
synthetic organic chemistry, which led to impactful changes on how pharmaceutically active
compounds were prepared and reduced their environmental burden,[5] similar changes can be
envisaged for polymer chemistry. The focus of this review will be on the application of green
chemistry principles to polymer systems, Figure 1, and highlight ways in which polymer lifecycles can be made more environmentally benign.[6]

There is a clearly a need for plastics in the modern world from low cost packaging materials
through to high-value electronics and biomedical applications. However, the environmental
cost of plastics has been in the spotlight for the past few decades due to the environmental
persistence of the polymers produced at the largest scale, including polyethylene,
polypropylene, polystyrene and poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET.[7] These materials gradually
break down in the environment and lead to the formation of microplastics, which can enter the
food chain and have been found even in the remote arctic environment.[8] Plastic pollution
significantly impacts the critical situation concerning the planetary boundary for novel
entities,[9] which can no longer be ignored. This has led to unprecedented research efforts
focused on developing a more environmentally-benign plastics industry.[10]
2.

Design for Degradation

Design of degradable polymers can follow two main approaches: (i) design for biodegradation
so accumulation in the environment is prevented, or (ii) design for recycling to monomer or
repurposing in order to reduce carbon footprints and costs whilst allowing entry into a circular
economy.[11] In addition to the polymeric macromolecules, it is also important to consider the
effects of polymer additives such as plasticizers, fillers and pigments.[12] In some cases
additives can be potentially toxic and environmentally-persistent compounds such as
halogenated flame retardants. We have recently reported the use of biochar as an additive
(filler and pigment) that increased the rigidity of poly(-caprolactone),[13] and we imagine that
more bio-derived materials will be used as additives in polymers moving forward. In some
cases, addition of bio-sourced fillers, e.g. nanocellulose, can boost degradation of
biodegradable polymers.[14, 15]

2.1. Biodegradation and environmentally-relevant degradation
In some cases, materials are designed for easier biodegradation i.e. they contain bonds that are
more susceptible to hydrolysis. In particular, the most commonly discussed degradable
polymers all contain ester linkages: poly(lactic acid), Figure 2, polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(ecaprolactone), poly(butylene succinate) and poly(butylene terephthalate) copolymers.
Hydrolysis can occur due to enzymes present within bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, these
microbes can evolve naturally or by human design to degrade some commercially-relevant
polymers especially polyesters. The BOTTLE consortium based in the USA has made significant
progress in developing enzymatic processes for recycling poly(ethylene terephthalate).[16] New
polymers, poly(imide-esters), have been made from bio-feedstocks and are inherently
degradable in water [17]
2.2 Chemocatalytic Degradation and other chemical approaches
While poly(lactic acid), PLA, poly(-caprolactone) and other polyesters are degradable in
industrial composting sites, new polyesters (and closely related polymers) have been designed
for chemical recycling to monomer.[11] Chemical recycling to monomer is needed as current
mechanical recycling of polymers can lead to less desirable polymer properties in the recycled
polymer compared with the original virgin material. In this regard, a recent paper has been
published on depolymerization of PLA to lactic acid using electrochemistry and real waste
materials could also be electrolyzed.[18] It is exciting to think that this approach might be
extendable to other polymer systems. Another approach to recycle PLA described using 0.01
mol% commercial tin catalyst under solid-state conditions at 160 C to yield 92% cyclic lactide
monomer.[19] Importantly, the catalyst could be recycled and the team were also able to
depolymerize waste coffee cup lids to monomer in excellent yield. A similar solid-state catalytic
approach could also be used to depolymerize poly(cyclohexene carbonate) to cyclohexene
oxide and carbon dioxide. Catalyst activity could be screened on a small scale (100-200 mg
polymer) using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA),[20] and could be scaled up to 2.00 g of
polymer.[21]
Most efforts towards polymer recycling have focused on polyolefins and polyesters, as these
classes of polymers are produced in the largest quantities worldwide. However, a recent review
has focused on the degradation of oxygenated polymers (polyethers and polysiloxanes).[22] In
this area, Miller and co-workers have reported the depolymerization of poly(dimethylsiloxane),
PDMS, in the presence of catalytic NaOH to yield a cyclic monomer that can undergo ringopening polymerization under acidic conditions.[23] This work highlights that some polymers
can be depolymerized and repolymerized using simple catalyst systems, and not all
depolymerizations will require extensive catalyst optimization. However, this system was
designed initially using a computational approach to identify the optimum diol to use in the
process and such approaches could be beneficial elsewhere.
Due to the outstanding mechanical properties of ultra-high molecular weight poly(ethylene), it
is challenging to replace it with a degradable or depolymerizable material. Coates and co-

workers have a developed a route to ultra-high molecular weight poly(dioxolane), Mn > 1,000
kDa.[24] In their earlier report, chemical recycling to monomer was reported using relatively
mild heat (140-150 C) using 2 mol% camphorsulfonic acid.[25] They also showed that pure
monomer could be recovered from a mixed plastic waste stream including polyolefins,
poly(vinyl chloride) and polyesters.
3.

Use of Renewable Feedstocks

This is a ‘hot’ topic in polymer chemistry at the moment, Figure 3.[26] However, in addition to
targeting desirable polymer properties, it is important to pay attention to the origin of
feedstock. In order to be sustainable, and not compete with food production or lead to habitat
destruction and biodiversity loss, by-products from other industries should be prioritized e.g.
lignin from forestry and paper industries, chitin from seafood processing discards. Our group
and others have proposed the development of a marine biorefinery to yield a range of products
including biopolymers from ocean biomass.[27] In this regard, it can be useful to think about
what green chemistry methods can be used in extracting the value-added products e.g.
vegetable oils can be used as environmentally-friendly solvents to extract pigments from waste
crab shells.[28] However, there remain significant unmet challenges such as ‘green’
decolourization methods to yield the near-white chitin that market demands. Ionic liquids and
mechanochemistry have played an important role in processing bio-sourced carbohydrates
especially chitin and cellulose.[29, 30]

chitin. (ii) Left to right: citric acid, linoleic acid and limonene oxide

3.1. Biopolymers
Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, chitin, chitosan and alginic acid are just some of the
biopolymers that can be extracted from natural feedstocks. Some of these are used directly or
they can be modified for a range of applications. For example, chitin can be deacetylated to
produce chitosan and the resulting chitosan can be tailored regarding its molecular weight by
mechanochemical treatment using phosphoric acid.[31] Mechanochemistry has also been used
to produce functional biopolymers from chitosan.[32] These examples highlight the
employment of green techniques in modification and processing of biopolymers. It is also worth
noting that seaweed aquaculture has been highlighted as an important tool for meeting global
sustainability targets.[33] In addition to yielding alginic acid and other carbohydrates, it fixes
atmospheric carbon dioxide, counteracts ocean eutrophication and provides habitats to ensure
marine biodiversity. Biopolymers can also be transformed to produce monomers e.g. starch to
lactic acid to PLA, and hexoses produced via hydrolysis of starch or cellulose can be converted
to 2,5-furandicaboxylic acid (FDCA). FDCA has been used instead of terephthalic acid in the
manufacture of polyesters with properties similar to PET.
3.2. Bioderived monomers
In addition to monomers made from carbohydrates such as lactide made from starch obtained
from maize, many other molecules e.g. citric acid,[17] have been sourced from nature and used
to make polymers, Figure 3. In our own research, we have been exploring triglycerides and fatty
acids e.g. linoleic acid. An excellent review has been published on making biobased polymers
and networks from vegetable oils.[34] Inspired by such studies, we used oil isolated from fish
processing waste to make non-isocyanate polyurethanes.[35] In addition to the oil, we used
carbon dioxide to make the intermediate organic carbonates and a commercial, crosslinking
amine (Cardolite NC-540), which is prepared from waste cashew nutshells. Terpenes, which can
be bio-sourced, are also being widely studied as monomers. Some are used directly but others
are modified in someway. For example, -pinene from pine sap was isomerized to yield pinene that underwent ring-opening metathesis polymerization to give hydrocarbon polymers
(Mn >70 kDa, Tg ~100 C).[36] Limonene can be obtained from waste citrus fruit peels and then
converted to limonene oxide. This bio-derived epoxide can then be used to make
polycarbonates,[37, 38] and polyesters.[39]
3.3. Carbon Dioxide
Use of carbon dioxide as a co-monomer to produce polycarbonates has attracted significant
attention as it uses a waste, polluting gas and also allows the replacement of toxic reagents(e.g.
phosgene) in the synthesis of polymers.[37, 40] At first these carbon dioxide-derived polymers
were an academic curiosity but in the past twenty years they have been commercialized by
many companies worldwide to produce polyols for polyurethane synthesis. More recently,
Nozaki has pioneered the synthesis of polymers from carbon dioxide and butadiene, Figure
4.[41]

Figure 4: Copolymers of carbon dioxide formed with (i) epoxides and (ii) butadiene via
intermediate EVP (3-ethylidene-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one).
In order to diversify the properties of the resulting polymers, post-polymerization modifications
have been investigated to yield tailor made materials including self-healing polymers.[38] The
two most extensively studied reactions fall under the title of click reactions: thiol-ene and
alkyne-azide couplings.
3.3.1 Earth Abundant Element and Non-Metal Catalysts
In this area, our group has been targeting catalyst systems containing earth-abundant
elements: iron [42] and aluminum.[43] In some cases, the activity of these compounds may be
less than desired but valuable insights can be obtained regarding structure-activity
relationships.[44] We then extended our research to include non-metal catalysts in particular
we studied BPh3 and B(C6F5)3 alongside suitable co-catalysts to produce cyclic and
polycarbonates.[45] We have also made block copolymers, poly(carbonate-co-ester), via initial
copolymerization of anhydrides in the presence of excess epoxide and once the was consumed,
carbon dioxide was added to form the carbonate block.[39] Some of the most active boroncontaining catalysts for these reactions include ionic tags and multiple Lewis acid sites within a
single molecule.[46] This field has recently been reviewed.[47]
3.1.2 Tandem Catalytic, One-pot Route to Modified Polymers
As boranes and frustrated Lewis pairs are known to facilitate a wide array of catalytic reactions,
we thought a tandem catalytic approach might be possible to yield functional polycarbonates.
We found that a one-pot reaction could be performed between vinyl cyclohexene oxide, carbon
dioxide and silanes to produce silylated polycarbonates.[48] In the course of this reaction, we
used online IR spectroscopy to monitor kinetics in situ and this highlighted that an increase in
temperature was needed to conduct the hydrosilation reaction in the presence of the
polymerization co-catalyst.

Conclusions
The principles of green chemistry should not only be thought of as an organic chemist’s toolbox
although that is where they have perhaps been most widely used to date. They can be applied
across all chemistry disciplines. During recent years, plastics and therefore polymers have been
the focus of growing concern due to the persistence of many in the environment and the
subsequent impact that they then have on biodiversity and all life on earth. Therefore, at this
time, polymer chemistry is particularly suited to a ‘green revolution’.[10] Metal-catalysed
polymerization reactions have long been established and the use of renewable feedstocks to
produce new materials has grown exponentially in recent years. Some of this has been aided by
the employment of green chemistry techniques such as mechanochemistry and in situ reaction
monitoring. Plastics designed to be degradable and part of the circular economy are being
investigated at an accelerated pace. However, there are gaps in our knowledge and also criteria
need to be laid out to allow easy comparison of related systems. This could include life-cycle
assessments or other sustainability metrics, or improved adherence to best practices e.g. use of
ISO test conditions to measure biodegradability.[49]
