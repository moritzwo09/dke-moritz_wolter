Abstract: Struvite crystallization, a promising technology for nutrient recovery from wastewater, is ever more encountering challenges due
to the presence of emerging contaminants such as microplastics, which are ubiquitous in wastewater. In this study, we investigate the roles
of microplastics and humic acid in struvite crystallization in batch and fluidized bed reactors, with emphasis on crystallization kinetics and
physicochemical properties of struvite crystals. Batch crystallization kinetic experiments were conducted with synthetic wastewater with
varying concentrations of microplastics and humic acid. The results showed that microplastics expedited the nucleation and growth rates
of struvite (e.g., 1.43 times the blank suspension in the presence of 30 mg L−1 of zinc loaded polyethylene terephthalate particulates), while
humic acid hindered the formation of struvite. Besides, X-ray diffraction analysis and the Rietveld refinement revealed that the presence
of microplastics and/or humic acid can result in quite many changes in phase compositions of the reclaimed precipitates in batch and
fluidized bed reactors. The characterization analysis demonstrated that microplastics act as seeds of struvite nucleation, spurring the
formation of well-defined struvite, while humic acid favors the formation of newberyite rather than struvite in both the batch and the
fluidized bed reactors. These findings highlight the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between emerging
contaminants and struvite crystallization processes to optimize nutrient recovery strategies for mitigating their adverse impact on the quality
and yield of struvite-based fertilizers.
1. Introduction
Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for the survival of all
living organisms on our planet. Over 90% of P in all the living
beings on earth originated from ores, non-renewable resources [1,
2]. The world population has been about 8.1 billion so far
according to the most recent United Nations estimates, which will
spur a growing demand for more mineral fertilizers for food
production. This will no doubt accelerate the depletion of global
phosphate rock reserves since more than 90% of P ores were
consumed in the production of fertilizers [3-5]. Moreover, quite
much of P fertilizers are lost from the croplands or forestlands into
waterways due to soil erosion [2] and find their way to the ocean
eventually [6]. Such a one-way phosphorus flow (i.e., P flux from
rock to ocean) is unsustainable considering the limitation in the
supply of accessible phosphate rocks, and the impossibility of
geologically replenishing these ores by natural phosphorus cycle
[7]. It is therefore pressingly needed to develop efficient P
recovery and recycling strategies for reclaiming this valuable
element from P-rich streams and effluents (viz. secondary P
resources), thus implementing a closed P cycle in the context of the
circular economy.
Chemical precipitation has been demonstrated as one of the most
promising approaches for P recovery from waste streams [8-11].
Over the past decades, struvite crystallization via chemical
precipitation, in particular, has gained much more attention as the
route strategy for P recovery and recycling due to its practical value
to the fertilizer industry [1, 12]. Historically, struvite formation
and accumulation in municipal wastewater treatment plants
(MWTPs) often cause operational issues, especially leading to the
clogging of pipelines conveying supernatant from sludge digestion
systems [13, 14]. Nevertheless, a heap of benefits accompanied by
P recovery through struvite crystallization have been identified, viz.
the reduction in P and nitrogen load of side-stream and sludge
liquors within pipelines of MWTPs, the decline of total sludge
volumes, and more importantly the additional value for the
MWTPs by commercializing the reclaimed struvite

(MgNH4PO4‧6H2O) as fertilizers [14-16]. Thereafter, extensive
laboratory-scale investigations have been carried out worldwide [9,
10, 14, 17-19], which have significantly advanced the practical
application of this technology at the industrial scale [20, 21].
Generally, both the P recovery efficiency through struvite
crystallization and the quality of reclaimed struvite are usually
determined by the water compositional chemistry of the parent
solutions [14, 22]. Specifically, solution pH, the molar ratio of
Mg:NH4+:PO43−, and the co-occurred foreign species or impurities
collectively play a critical role in defining the efficiency of
phosphorus recovery as well as the quality of reclaimed struvite
[12, 23, 24]. It was reported that the presence of sulfate ions can
remarkedly reduce the P recovery efficiency in a fluidized-bed
reactor (FBR), while the copresence of sulfate and fluoride ions did
not impact the P recovery efficiency but lowered the quality of the
reclaimed struvite, viz. reducing its crystallization ratio [23].
Kofina et al. observed that the presence of citrate and
phosphocitrate can depress struvite precipitation up to 75-80% in
batch reactors (BRs) at pH 8.5 and 25 °C [25]. Similarly, the
inhibiting impacts of humic acid (HA) [26, 27], alginic acid [28],
and phenolic organics [29] on struvite formation were
demonstrated respectively. Interestingly, glucose [26], and some
volatile fatty acids (VFAs), e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate
[30] were believed to improve and facilitate the crystallization
process of struvite, and hence the crystallization ratio. In addition
to the struvite crystallization ratio, and more importantly, the
cooccurring of toxic impurities such as heavy metals, antibiotics,
and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), can pose a biosecurity
issue to the croplands where the reclaimed struvite was applied [27,
31-34]. Moreover, recent studies indicated that microplastics (MPs)
are omnipresent in environmental media, including nutrient-rich
waste streams [35, 36]. MPs can act as a vector of toxic pollutants
[37]. Such MPs are likely to be encapsulated into calcium
carbonate in the chemical precipitation process when exposing to
dissolved organic matter (DOM) [38]. However, little is known on
the effects of MPs along with HA on the struvite formation kinetic

as well as the quality of the resulting struvite precipitates,
especially in the context of P recovery from nutrient-rich waste
streams via struvite crystallization. It is also not known whether
MPs can act as a deposition platform or nucleation seed for struvite.
This study aims to identify how aged MPs and DOM molecules
influence the crystallization kinetics and the quality of struvite in
BRs and FBRs (Scheme 1) under ambient conditions. HA was
selected as the model DOM molecule, while aged polyethylene (PE)
and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pellets were chosen to
represent MPs. Trace heavy metals such as copper and zinc ions
are likely to be found in nutrient-rich streams (e.g., swine
wastewater) and bound to the surface of MPs [39, 40]. Two aged
MP suspensions were dispersed and loaded with dissolved Cu2+ or
Zn2+ individually before applying in the struvite crystallization
experiments. The suspension pH and the dissolved phosphate
concentration were monitored to study the crystallization kinetics.
X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, and
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to
investigate the quality of reclaimed struvite.

2.2 Struvite crystallization in a batch reactor (BR)
The batch crystallization kinetic experiments were carried out
with a constant Mg:N:P molar ratio of 1:3:1 in a 1000-mL beaker
(Figure S1a, Supporting Information) at standard atmospheric
pressure and temperature (ca. 25 °C). In brief, solution A was
prepared by dissolving 0.83 mmol of KH2PO4 into 493 mL of DI
water, to which a dilute NaOH solution was added to adjust the pH
to 11 ± 0.2. Likewise, solution B was synthesized by combining
0.83 mmol of MgCl2 and 2.5 mmol of NH4Cl with 7 mL of DI water,
which was then quickly poured into the beaker with solution A and
mixed moderately over a magnetic stirrer (INTLLAB, Shenzhen,
China). The pH of the resulting suspension (denoted by the
impurities inside or blank) was monitored using a pH meter (PHS25, Rex Electric Chemical) and recorded every minute for 60 min,
while the concentration of remaining soluble phosphate (PO3−
4 -P)
was measured every 5 min following the ascorbic acid method as
described elsewhere [41]. Five mL of suspension was sampled at
5-minute intervals and immediately forced through a 0.45-μm
mixed cellulose ester membrane filter mounted with a syringe. The
filtrate was then acidized with 20 μL of 6M HCl to stop the
crystallization reaction [42]. Next, the concentration of soluble
phosphate was determined using a JH723PC visible
spectrophotometer (Shanghai, China). The effects of aged MPs
and HA on the crystallization kinetics were studied following the
same protocols with the addition of a certain amount of such
specific impurities.
All the precipitate samples were collected centrifugally after the
termination of each batch reaction (i.e., 60 min), followed by
rinsing twice with DI water and drying in an oven at 80 °C
overnight. The crystallization kinetic rate constant was determined
by fitting the data to a first-order kinetic model that was formulated
as follows [42],
𝑑𝐶
−
= 𝑘(𝐶0 −𝐶𝑒 )
(1)
𝑑𝑡
ln (𝐶−𝐶𝑒 ) = −𝑘𝑡 + ln (𝐶0 −𝐶𝑒 )
(2)
Where k is the rate constant (h−1), C is the soluble phosphate
(reactant) concentration (mg L−1) at time t, C0 and Ce are the
phosphate (PO3−
4 -P) concentration at initial and equilibrium state
(mmol·L-1).
2.3 Struvite crystallization in an FBR
Struvite formation kinetic experiments were also performed in a
customer-made FBR (Figure S1b, Supporting Information) [43].
The phosphate-enriched effluents were from a set of rapid
adsorption-desorption enrichment operations as described in our
earlier works [44, 45]. The FBR feed solution (~ 5 L) was prepared
by combining the phosphate-enriched effluents with certain
amounts of MgCl2 and NH4Cl to achieve a final Mg:N:P molar
ratio of 1.3:4:1 [23]. Sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 M) was used
as the alkaline solution to adjust the initial pH of the feed solution
to above 11 within the FBR setup. To start with, the feed solution
was fed into the FBR at a flow rate of 5 mL min−1 for 5 min using
a peristaltic pump (BT-100, Longer Pump Co., China). Next, the
NaOH solution was fed at a flow rate of 3 mL min −1 using another
pump, while the third pump linking the bottom and the upper top
of the FBR setup was launched meanwhile at 10 mL min −1 to
circulate the mixture and keep a fluidization state.
After circulating for 6 days, the experiment was terminated and
the struvite precipitates were reclaimed from the FBR bottom
(Figure S1b), followed by centrifugal separating, rinsing thrice
with DI water, and air drying over 24 h before further
characterization. The effects of seed (MgNH4PO4‧6H2O, 98.0%),
and PET impurity on struvite formation in FBRs were investigated.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
All chemicals used for struvite crystallization are of analytical
pure grade. Monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4, ≥99.0%),
magnesium chloride (MgCl2, ≥98.0%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH,
≥99.0%), and ammonium magnesium phosphate hexahydrate
(MgNH4PO4‧6H2O, 98.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Ammonium
chloride (NH4Cl, 99.5%) was obtained from Macklin Biochemical
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Humic acid (HA) was provided by
Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).
The microplastics (MPs), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) of ca. 50 μm in size were purchased from
Wangda Plastic Material Co., Ltd (Dongguan, China). and
artificially aged over 20 days using a heat persulfate oxidation
method. After loading with copper or zinc ions in a set of
adsorption experiments [40], the metal-loaded MPs (denoted by
PE-Cu, PE-Zn, PET-Cu, and PET-Zn, respectively) were used as
impurities in the struvite crystallization experiments. Ultrapure
deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ‧cm, 25 °C) was employed for
preparing solutions.

PO3−
4 -P in the suspension denoted blank decreased rapidly with
reaction time, approaching to equilibrium state at about 40, and 20
min, respectively. The struvite formation reaction would consume
a large amount of PO3−
, which shifts the equilibrium of
4
orthophosphate species to the right-hand side (i.e., H3PO4 ↔ H2PO
−
2−
3−
+
+
+
4 + H ↔ HPO4 + 2H ↔ PO4 + 3H ), releasing a lot of protons
to the suspension and thereby lowering its pH eventually. It was
found that the initial nucleation rate of struvite is extremely fast
when the suspension pH is > 9 [42]. Note that a distinct lag phase
developed as the suspension pH fell from above 9 to the range of
8.65−8.35 (the yellow-shaded region in Figure 1c), which is likely
attributed to the reduced nucleation kinetics by the decrease in pH
[42]. With an assumption that the inverse reaction of struvite
formation is minimal and negligible, the data recorded in the initial
metastable stage before achieving an equilibrium state (0-16 min)
was chosen to fit with the first-order kinetic model (eq. 2), and the
best-fit kinetic equations and corresponding parameters are
tabulated in Table 1. The fit coefficient (R2) is as high as 0.978 for
the suspension blank, indicating the first-order kinetic model is
reasonable enough to describe and predict the changes in soluble

less than that reported earlier at pH 9 (i.e., 12.3 h ) [42], which is
likely due to the difference of the struvite-forming ion
concentration and ratios applied that defines the supersaturation of
the resulting solutions. Supersaturation is believed to be the
primary influence on the struvite formation induction time
provided that mixing is sufficient [46]. Moreover, the induction

Actual wastewater (WW) from a local sewage treatment plant
(Table S1) was used to explore the effect of natural DOM on
struvite formation.
2.4 Characterization of the reclaimed precipitates
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Shimadzu
XRD-6100 diffractometer with Cu-K radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å).
Mass percentages of mineral phase in the reclaimed precipitates
were calculated by the whole-pattern fitting (WPF) module
embedded in Jade software (MDI, USA). Using the soil mode, the
elemental composites of the reclaimed precipitates were recorded
using a handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer of the
DELTA series DC-4000 (Olympus, USA). A Nicolet iS5
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA) was used for Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy acquisition. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an SU1510
electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of
1.5 kV.
3. Results and Discussions
3.1 Effect of MPs on the kinetics of struvite formation in BRs
Apart from Mg2+, there are no other species (e.g., Ca2+ or DOM)
in the suspensions that can form precipitates or complexes with
phosphate, so the likelihood of struvite formation can be verified
by monitoring the decrease in PO3−
4 -P concentration and the pH,
thereby determining the kinetics of struvite crystallization
indirectly. As shown in Figure 1a-b, both the pH and the soluble

time has been included in our case while it seems to be excluded
by Nelson et al. [42], as evidenced by the difference in the time
range selected (0−16 min versus 2−9 min). This also contributed
to the relatively less kinetic rate constant in the current study.
When the aged MP impurities were introduced into the
suspensions, for instance, PE-Cu pellets (i.e., PE-Cu-3, and PE-Cu30), the initial pH dropped from 9.1 to ~ 8.7 (Figure 1a), possibly
since all the MP pellets were aged by the heat persulfate oxidation
(HPO) and preloaded copper or zinc ions in suspension at pH 6
[40]. Similar plots of PO3-4 -P versus time in the presence of PE-Cu
as that of blank demonstrates that struvite was formed in a similar
way (Figure 1b). More importantly, note that the more the PE-Cu
impurities are introduced, the faster the soluble PO3-4 -P
concentration reaches a steady state in the initial 20 min (Figure
1b), suggesting that the introduction of PE-Cu can facilitate the
struvite formation. Likewise, the lag phases appeared once again
in the plots of PO3-4 -P versus pH in suspension with PE-Cu
impurities as pH fell within the range of 8.65-8.35 (Figure 1c), but
the pH span is narrower than that of the blank sample, indicating
that the presence of PE-Cu also enhances the nucleation kinetics.
In addition, the linearities of both experimental data with PE-Cu
impurities show a good fit (R2 > 0.95, Figure 1e-f), demonstrating
that the first-order kinetic model is reasonable in predicting the
decrease in the logarithmic concentration of soluble PO3−
4 -P in
suspensions with PE-Cu impurities. The kinetic rate constants are
7.86, and 10.14 h−1 for PE-Cu-3, and PE-Cu-30, respectively
(Table 1), both greater than that for the blank suspension,
confirming the positive effect of PE-Cu in promoting struvite
formation in BRs.

PE-Zn (Figure S2a-b), and PET-Zn (Figure S3a-b). The kinetic
fitting results (Table 1) demonstrated high linearity (Figure 2c-d,
Figure S2c-d, Figure S3c-d) as well, confirming the generalized
applicability of the first-order model in describing the change of
soluble PO3−
4 -P in these suspensions with varying impurities during
the struvite formation process. For instance, the presence of 30
ppm of PET-Zn demonstrated the rapidest crystallization kinetic
rate, 1.43 times of the blank (Table 1). Recall that the introduction
of these MP impurities can somewhat decrease the initial pH
(Figure 1b, 2b), thereby increase the induction time by depressing
the nucleation kinetics [42, 47]. This speculation is evidenced by
the slightly lower rate constants of suspensions with 3 mg L−1 of
MP impurities than that of the blank suspension (Table 1).
However, the addition of more MP impurities into these
suspensions (i.e., up to 30 mg L−1) can distinctly offset the reduced
nucleation kinetics caused by the decline in pH, as revealed by the
higher rate constants compared to that of the blank suspension (i.e.,
kPE-Zn-30 > kPE-Cu-30 > kPET-Cu-30 > kPET-Zn-30 > kblank, see Table 1).
3.2 Effect of HA and MPs on the kinetics of struvite formation in
BRs
Recall that HA is believed to inhibit the crystallization of struvite
[26, 27]. As shown in Figure 3a-b, the decreases in both the
suspension pH and the soluble PO3−
4 -P concentration with time are
slower in the presence of HA relative to those of blank, indicating
the inhibitory impact of HA on the formation of struvite. Using in
situ liquid-cell atomic force microscopy, Ge et al observed that HA
can greatly stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate by the
formation of molecular organo-mineral bonding, thereby delaying
the crystallization of thermodynamically stable calcium phosphate
[48]. It was found that HA preferentially binds divalent or trivalent
cations by forming humic-metal complexes of medium to high
stability, which is likely to further bind P and form humic-metal-P
complexes in aqueous solutions [49]. Interestingly, the initial pH
of these suspensions with HA has been increased by 0.2 and 0.5
units for the suspension HA-10 and HA-100, respectively, possibly
due to the higher affinity of HA toward protons [50]. Preceding
reports suspected that organic acids are likely to complex with
Mg2+ and NH+4 to form complexes of high thermodynamical
stability and release protons meanwhile, leading to the gradual
decrease in solution supersaturation and the significant increase in
free energy barrier for nucleation and thus the induction time [26,
51]. Besides, these organic acids may be sorbed over the active
sites of the nuclei, yielding molecular organo-mineral complexes
of high stability and thus blocking the struvite crystal growth [26,
48].
Note that the linear fitting and description of the logarithmic
concentration of soluble PO3−
4 -P versus time using the first-order
model (eq. 2) failed in suspensions of HA over the range of 0−10
min (Figure 3c-d). However, the logarithmic concentration of
soluble PO3−
4 -P showed excellent linearity against time in the range
of 0-4 min, with rate constants (k) as high as 20.16, and 27.42 h−1
for suspension HA-10, and HA-100, respectively (Table 1). Such
higher k values would not contribute to the struvite formation
reaction based on the above explanation, but probably to the
formation of HA-metal-phosphate complexes of high
thermodynamical stability [48, 49]. Interestingly, when cointroducing 10 mg L−1of HA and 30 mg L−1of PET-Cu into the
blank suspension (i.e., the HA+PET-Cu suspension), the plot of pH
versus time changed slightly whereas the plot of soluble PO3−
4 -P
versus time varied remarkably (Figure 3a-b). This observation

Similarly, the same trends of pH and soluble PO3−
-P
4
concentration with time have also been observed in the cases of
suspensions with other impurities including PET-Cu (Figure 2a-b),

Figures S4c) and functional groups (P-O, N-H, and O-H, Figure 4c),
are highly identical to the XRD results (Figure 4a-b). Moreover,
the SEM images showed that the blank precipitate is composed of
well-defined microcrystal mixtures (Figure 4d1), with cubic halite
(marked by a yellow arrow, Figure 4d2), newberyite microrods
(marked by a blue arrow, Figure 4d2), and irregular-shaped salammoniac.
Interestingly, there were clear changes in the XRD pattern of the
reclaimed precipitate when 3 mg L−1 (ppm) of PE-Cu was
introduced (red line labeled as PE-Cu-3, Figure 4a), with
increasing intensities of newberyite and disappearing of other
phases. Similar changes were also observed in the XRD pattern of
precipitate reclaimed from BRs with 3 ppm of PE-Zn ((red line,
Figure S4a). The WPF refinement results indicated that there are
96.7 wt% of newberyite, 2.9 wt% of MgHPO4‧xH2O (JCPDS #460375), and trace magnesite (MgCO3, JCPDS #80-0101) in
precipitate PE-Cu-3 (Figure 4b), while PE-Zn-3 is composed of
95.8 wt% newberyite and 4.2 wt% struvite (JCPDS #71-2089,
Figure S4b). These observations suggest that the presence of PE
impurities, irrespective of the metal ions loaded, can facilitate the
formation of newberyite. This is evidenced by the corresponding
FTIR spectra with greater intensities of P-O vibrations (e.g., P-O
stretching at 1004 cm−1) and less intensities of N-H vibration at
1427 cm−1 compared to those observed in the blank precipitate
(Figures 4c, S4d). Besides, SEM images show that rod-like
newberyite embedded in PE surface dominates in precipitate PECu-3 (Figure 4e), whereas PE-Zn-3 is predominant by irregular
scale-like newberyite grew over the surface of PE particulates
(Figure S5b). Therefore, it's reasonable to speculate that PE

indicates that the pH values are primarily governed by the HA,
while the induction time is dominated by PET-Cu. Note that the
first-order model demonstrates a good fit in describing the
logarithmic concentration of soluble PO3−
4 -P against time in
suspension HA+PET-Cu (Figure 3e), with a rate constant of 5.76
h−1 (Table 1). In comparison with suspensions blank and PET-Cu30, the rate constants follow the order kPET-Cu-30 > kblank > kHA+PETCu, indicating that PET-Cu and HA played exactly opposite roles in
struvite formation. Collectively, HA molecules appear to inhibit
struvite formation by a set of complexation reactions even at a low
content (e.g., 10 mg L−1), and MPs are likely to compensate for this
inhibitory influence of HA by reducing the induction time and
thereof facilitate the crystallization of struvite in the complex
suspensions.
3.3 Effect of MPs on the precipitates reclaimed from BRs
Apart from the influence on the kinetic of struvite formation,
both MPs and HA also played different roles in regulating the
physiochemical properties (e.g., morphologies, chemical, and
phase compositions) of the resulting precipitates in BRs. In the
absence of any impurities (i.e., the blank suspension), for instance,
the precipitate (denoted as blank) demonstrated a well-defined
XRD pattern (Figure 4a). By using the Rietveld refinement
algorithm (i.e., the WPF refinement module in Jade version 6.5,
MDI), we calculated that the phase compositions of the precipitate
blank are 16.6 wt% newberyite (MgHPO4‧3H2O, JCPDS #751714), 32 wt% halite (NaCl, JCPDS #70-2509), and 51.4 wt% salammoniac (NH4Cl, JCPDS #73-0365) (Figure 4b). XRF and FTIR
spectra revealed that its major chemical compositions (P, K, Cl, etc.,

particulates (highlighted with PE in Figure 4) govern the phase
transformation while the metal ions loaded on PE (viz. Cu2+, Zn2+)
regulate the morphology of the resulting newberyite. It is worth
noting that both precipitates were dominated by struvite when 30
ppm of PE-Cu or PE-Zn were added into the BRs, with 92.3 wt%
and 80 wt% struvite in PE-Cu-30 and PE-Zn-30, respectively
(Figures 4a-b, S4a-b). Molecular spectrum results (Figures 4c,
S4c-d) also demonstrate the above observations. Note that the
surfaces of PE particulates were embedded by many irregular
struvite microcrystals (Figure 4f, S5c), implying PE impurities, in
particular the cracked or defective domains, can serve as centers
for nucleation and crystallization of struvite and newberyite [12,
47]. Given the fact that the presence of 3 ppm PE-Cu or PE-Zn
favored the formation of newberyite while the addition of 30 ppm
of PE facilitated the transformation from newberyite to struvite
(Figures 4b, S4b), we can conclude that newberyite is less
thermodynamically stable in the pH region studied but struvite is
more sensitive to co-occurring impurities [52].
Notably, no newberyite was found in the precipitates in the
presence of PET impurities, regardless of the metals loaded and

their contents in the reaction suspensions (Figures 5, S6). Only
rod-like struvite and amorphous components were identified in
these precipitates (i.e., PET-Cu(Zn)-3(30), Figures 5, S6, S7). The
more PET impurities presented, the more struvite crystals were
formed, with up to 83.3 wt% and 97.8 wt% of struvite found in
PET-Cu-30 and PET-Zn-30, respectively (Figures 5b, S6b). These
struvite crystals were embedded in PET surfaces (Figures 5d-e) or
coated over these impurities (Figures S7b-c). In comparison to PE
impurities, PET particulates are more likely to induce the
formation of struvite under the same conditions, which may
contribute to their much more oxygen-containing functional
groups relative to PE particulates [40].
3.4 Effect of HA on the precipitates reclaimed from BRs
In contrast to the above MP impurities, the presence of HA
impurities cannot fully suppress the formation of halite crystals
even if its content is as high as 100 ppm (Figures S8, S9). However,
as observed in the presence of low doses of PE impurities (viz. PECu(Zn)-3), the introduction of HA significantly promotes the
formation of newberyite (Figure S8). Specifically, the more HA

but not to farringtonite. Noticeably, the copresence of seed (1 g
L−1) and PET-Cu (30 ppm) impurities in the feed solution can
further spur the formation of struvite, with 35.4 wt% of struvite
found in the corresponding precipitate seed+PET-Cu (Figure 6b).
This observation verifies the seeding effect of PET particulates in
FBR once again, as noted above in BRs (Figure 5b).
In the case of using actual wastewater as the feed solution, its
phosphate concentration has been pre-adjusted up to 474 ppm,
three times the P concentration in other feed solutions in FBRs. A
preliminary experiment indicated that no precipitates were gained
when using actual wastewater as the feed solution containing 158
ppm of P. It can be speculated that, based on the high COD
concentration in the actual wastewater (Table S1), it is likely due
to the high content of DOM in the feed solution which somewhat
inhibited the formation of struvite [26, 29]. A large increase in the
P concentration of the feed solution can effectively compensate for
the inhibitory effect of DOM on struvite formation, yielding a
precipitate with a phase composition of 20.4 wt% struvite (versus
16.7 wt% struvite in the blank), 28.6 wt% farringtonite, and 51 wt%
amorphous components (Figure 6b). The corresponding FTIR
spectra with a group of typical infrared bands also confirmed the
phase evolutions of these precipitates (Figure 6c). SEM images
indicate that all the precipitates in FBRs are featured by many
irregular and compact agglomerates composed of numerous rodlike crystals (Figure 6d-g). Note that the more the seed and/or PET
impurities presented, the more compact the resulting precipitates
were (Figure 6f), in good agreement with earlier reports [1, 21].

was added in the reactant mixtures, the more newberyite crystals
were yielded, with a mass ratio as high as 95.4 wt% in the
precipitate HA-100, 5.7 times the ratio in the blank sample (Figure
S8b). This might be attributed to the massive deprotonated
carboxylic groups within HA molecules especially in alkaline
solutions, which often show greater affinity towards ammonia than
magnesium ions [53], thereby facilitating the formation of
newberyite rather than struvite.
Interestingly, when 100 ppm of HA and 30 ppm of PET-Cu were
added simultaneously in the reactant mixtures, the resulting
precipitate (i.e., HA+PET-Cu) is featured by a small amount of rodlike newberyite and a large amount of needle-like struvite crystals
(Figure S9). WPF refinement results indicate that it has a phase
composition of 18.5 wt% newberyite and 81.5 wt% struvite (Figure
S8). These results are identical to the aforementioned observations
that demonstrate the preference of PET impurities in inducing the
formation of struvite (Figures 5b, S6b), implying the potential
seeding effect of such impurities during the struvite crystallization
in BRs.
3.5 Effect of MPs and HA on the precipitates reclaimed from FBRs
As shown in Figure 6, no newberyite crystals were found in all
precipitates reclaimed from FBRs. A possible explanation would
be that newberyite is less thermodynamically stable than
farringtonite (Mg3(PO4)2, JCPDS #88-0413) in solutions at 25 °C
and 1 bar [54], which may lead to phase transformations from
newberyite to farringtonite and struvite during the 6-day operation
in FBRs. Different from the phase composition of the blank in BRs
(Figure 4b), the blank precipitate in FBRs is composed of 16.7 wt%
struvite, 71.2 wt% farringtonite, and 12.1 wt% of amorphous phase
(Figures 6a-b). When 1 g L−1 of pure MgNH4PO4‧6H2O was
introduced as seeds in the feed solutions, the amorphous
component disappeared and the amount of struvite was increased
to 31.7 wt% in the resulting precipitate denoted as seed (Figure 6b).
This phenomenon is as expected and indicates that seeds could
enhance the transformation of amorphous components to struvite

3.6 Roles of MPs and HA on struvite crystallization
The crystallization process can generally proceed in either
heterogeneous or homogenous manners according to the classical
nucleation theory [55]. Providing similar precursor elements and
the same conditions, heterogeneous nucleation occurs more
preferentially than homogenous nucleation as the free energy
barrier for nucleation may be significantly reduced in the presence
of colloidal or solid impurities [56]. Based on the above kinetic
and characterization results, it is clear that MP and HA exerted
quite different influences on the crystallization reactions
irrespective of the type of reactors where the reactions took place.
Note that the MP impurities used are indiscerptible PE and PET
particulates of ~ 50 μm in diameter (Figures 4e, 5d). Therefore,

7

the presence of either PE or PET renders the reaction system a
heterogeneous one due to their large surfaces that are favorable for
nucleation. The less in diameter and the rougher in surface, the
more the free energy barrier of nucleation of phosphate crystals
(e.g., struvite, newberyite, and farringtonite) would be reduced as
the MP surface can stabilize the newly formed nuclei. Specifically,
there are many defective domains as well as oxygen functional
groups over the surface of aged PE and PET particulates [40], both
of which are believed the most active binding centers for crystalforming ions and/or monomers, thereby facilitating the following
nucleation and crystallization of phosphate crystals [57]. Indeed,
the presence of either PE or PET has induced faster nucleation and
crystallization rates (Table 1), and a greater proportion of struvite
in the reclaimed precipitates (Figure 7a), verifying the seeding role
of such impurities in struvite crystallization in BRs and/or FBRs
[58, 59].
On the contrary, HA is a group of soluble macromolecules rich
in carboxyl and carbonyl groups, which are likely to bind struviteforming cations, and nuclei in aqueous solutions [49]. This
interaction appears to reduce the solution supersaturation and
increase the energy barrier of nucleation, prolonging the induction
time of nucleation and subsequent crystallization (Table 1) [26, 51].
Besides, as discussed above, the presence of HA appears to create
a favorable environment for newberyite formation (Figure 7a),
yielding a much higher proportion of rod-shaped newberyite
crystals in the presence of 100 ppm HA as impurities (Figures S8,
S9). This observation is in good agreement with previous reports
[26, 27]. In light of the above results, the roles of MPs and HA in
struvite formation have been rationally proposed and illustrated
schematically in Figure 7b. Specifically, MPs can lower the free
energy barrier of struvite formation by providing quite large
defective surfaces that serve as nucleation sites even though both

MP surface and struvite nuclei are negatively charged (Figure S10).
However, HA plays an inhibitory role in mediating the formation
of struvite, probably through a complex of interactions including
bridge complexation, static Coulomb interaction, and so on.
Collectively, both PE and PET particulates serve as seeding
materials spurring nucleation and subsequent crystallization of
struvite crystals in BRs and/or FBRs, while HA seems to inhibit
the formation of struvite but facilitate newberyite formation due to
complex interactions [60]. To this end, more investigations are
needed to elucidate the mechanism for this extraordinary role of
HA impurities on the molecular level.
4. Conclusions
This study has comprehensively elucidated the roles of aged
microplastic and humic acid impurities in the struvite
crystallization process in batch and fluidized bed reactors. The
crystallization kinetic results reveal that the presence of aged
microplastics significantly increases the nucleation and growth rate
of such crystals, primarily because the large surfaces of MP can
serve as reactive sites for newly formed nuclei, reducing the free
energy barrier of nucleation and thereby expediting the growth of
struvite in solutions. Humic acid, on the other hand, inhibits the
nucleation and growth of struvite crystals but favors the formation
of newberyite crystals.
Interestingly, the co-presence of
microplastics and humic acid can significantly compensate for the
inhibitory effects of humic acid on the formation rate of struvite,
yielding a precipitate dominated by struvite. Moreover, it also
showed that the presence of microplastics and/or humic acid can
significantly impact the quality of the resulting precipitates from
struvite crystallization, leading to complex changes in both the
phase compositions and the morphology. From an environmental
perspective, these findings provide crucial insights into a

previously underexplored interaction between microplastics,
humic substances, and crystal-forming ions during P recovery
processes in BRs and FBRs. Given the ubiquitous presence of
microplastics and humic substances in wastewater, our study
underscores the importance of considering the impact of
microplastics on nutrient recovery technologies and highlights the
necessity of tailored approaches to mitigate their adverse effects on
the efficiency of recovering nutrients in the form of struvite and the
quality of the reclaimed struvite, with significant implications for
wastewater treatment and sustainable agriculture.
