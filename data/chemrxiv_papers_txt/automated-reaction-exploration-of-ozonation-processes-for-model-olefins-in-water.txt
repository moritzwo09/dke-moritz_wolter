Abstract

3

The comprehensive evaluation of pollutant abatement during chemical oxidation

4

processes and identification of potentially hazardous transformation products are a fun-

5

damental challenge in water and wastewater treatment. Here, we demonstrate how high-

6

throughput computational chemistry enables the elucidation of reaction pathways via

7

automated, quantum-chemistry-based chemical reaction network (CRN) explorations.

8

We evaluated the predictive capabilities of this computational approach using the Soft-

9

ware for Chemical Interaction Networks (SCINE) for studying the reactions of ozone

10

with two olefins, ethene and tetramethylethene, in aqueous solution. Following a bench-

11

marking of the quantum chemical methodology for structure optimization and energy

12

calculations, we generated CRNs containing hundreds of compounds and thousands

13

of reactions, identified reaction mechanisms, and evaluated product formation kinetics

14

through microkinetic modeling. These CRN explorations led to the correct reproduc-

15

tion of experimental evidence for mechanisms and products of olefin ozonolysis for

16

reactions of ozone and ethene based solely on defining the reactants and their initial

17

concentrations. The study of reactions of ozone and tetramethylethene also matched

18

experimental data for the main products but revealed consequences of limited explo-

19

ration depth and shortcomings of the implicit solvation model. We envision that CRN

20

explorations not only offer novel means for predicting pollutant transformation path-

21

ways but will also support chemical analysis and the assessment of effects on human

22

and environmental health.

Introduction

27

The use of chemical oxidants including ozone, chlorine, and chlorine dioxide in water treat-

28

ment processes is essential to mitigate waterborne diseases and abate inorganic and organic

29

micropollutants. 1,2 Chemical oxidants have been used successfully for decades for the pro-

30

vision of safe drinking water and, more recently, for wastewater treatment. 2 Their reac-

31

tions with matrix components and organic pollutants create transformation and disinfection

32

(by)products which can cause adverse effects on human and environmental health. 3–12 Pro-

33

viding efficient disinfection/oxidation while minimizing toxic product formation is particu-

34

larly challenging for wastewater treatment and potable water reuse purposes where concen-

35

trations of dissolved organic matter and organic pollutants are typically much higher. 13–15

36

Evaluating the efficacy of pollutant abatement during chemical oxidation processes and iden-

37

tifying potentially hazardous transformation products are thus paramount for the implemen-

38

tation of adequate water treatment strategies. 16,17

39

To date, there is a large data base on reactions and mechanisms of oxidation reactions,

40

however, comprehensive experimental descriptions of all reaction pathways pertinent to ox-

41

idative water treatment would be extremely laborious and experimental evidence remains

42

inherently incomplete. 1 Computational support is therefore required to complement the ex-

43

perimental characterizations of oxidation processes. In fact, chemoinformatic (i.e., data-

44

driven) pathway prediction tools and first-principles quantum chemical calculations have

45

already assisted the experimental elucidation of kinetics and reaction pathways. Previously,

46

empirical reaction rules for reactive functional groups of compounds with unknown reactiv-

47

ity towards oxidants were applied to predict the formation of transformation products. 18,19

48

Furthermore, quantum chemical descriptors for structure activity relationships were estab-

49

lished, allowing access to chemical structures, their Gibbs energies, and barrier heights for

50

the characterization of reaction pathways. 20–25 However, quantum chemical construction of

51

potential energy surfaces (PES) requires significant manual input and guidance, limiting

52

computational analyses to specific reaction coordinates. These circumstances have so far

53

prevented a more expansive, systematic, and possibly predictive evaluation of reactions in-

54

volving chemical oxidants and organic micropollutants.

55

These restrictions can now be overcome with high-throughput computational chemistry

56

which offers new avenues to elucidate reaction pathways and mechanisms through chemical

57

reaction network (CRN) explorations. 26–29 Supported by the steady increase of computing

58

power and availability of high performance computing clusters, quantum chemistry based re-

59

action network explorations are developing rapidly and they make extensive use of algorithms

60

for their automated and autonomous execution. Several mechanism-exploration procedures

61

have been implemented in recent years (see compilation in ref 30 ). In the Software for Chemi-

62

cal Interaction Networks (SCINE), 26 which we will use in this study, such CRN explorations

63

are carried out in three principle steps. First, the reaction space is explored by searching

64

elementary steps which interconnect the molecular structures of reactants, intermediates,

65

transition states and products. To do so, first-principle heuristics, that is features of the

66

electronic wave function, facilitate the generation of reaction coordinates and thus predic-

67

tion of reactive sites in molecular structures for uni- and bimolecular reactions. Not only are

68

these algorithms agnostic to the functional groups in the studied molecules, but they also

69

allow for exploring all possible reactive combinations to obtain a comprehensive picture of

70

the reaction network. Second, the minimum and transition-state structures and correspond-

71

ing energies generated during the initial CRN explorations may require a refinement given

72

that these explorations are typically carried out with fast electronic structure methods such

73

as semipirical ones (e.g., xTB 31,32 ) and density functional theory (DFT). These quantum

74

chemical characterizations of the CRN can involve computationally more demanding cou-

75

pled cluster (CC) methods for electronic energy calculations. 27 Third, the obtained reaction

76

Gibbs energies need to be evaluated modeling experimental conditions in terms of shortest

77

reaction path to determine reaction mechanisms, 33 and microkinetic simulations to predict

78

the concentrations of all the compounds in the CRN. 34 Most recent developments address the

79

need for efficient navigation of CRN explorations and restrict the combinatorial explosion of

80

reaction paths by allowing user-defined interventions (e.g., by expert knowledge, on-the-fly

81

evaluation of concentration fluxes, interactive structure manipulation). 35–37

82

The goal of this study was to evaluate how automated CRN explorations can support

83

the elucidation of mechanisms and pathways of reactions of chemical oxidants with organic

84

compounds and provide a conceptual basis for future applications. We focused our study

85

on reactions of ozone with olefins in aqueous solution for purposes of both practical rele-

86

vance and systematic development of the computational methodology for CRN explorations.

87

Reactions of ozone with ethenes through the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (Criegee) mechanism

88

are furthermore prototypical for reactions of electron-rich olefins and aromatic compounds

89

in water treatment and their kinetics and mechanisms are well-documented with experi-

90

mental data. 20,38,39 Moreover, ozone has biradical and thus multireference character 40 and

91

its computational identification and optimization of molecular structures and predicting the

92

reaction energies may not be accurate with fast DFT methods, as illustrated in studies

93

of the Criegee mechanism. 22 Instead, single-reference coupled cluster methods are recom-

94

mended, 41,42 though they can be challenging to use given the large number of molecular

95

structures in CRNs. The specific objectives of this study were threefold. (i) We identified

96

the optimal computational methodology for automated CRN explorations with the Chemo-

97

ton software 30 through systematic evaluation of the Criegee mechanism for ozone and ethene

98

against benchmark studies of Wheeler et al. 41 (ii) We tested the predictive capabilities of

99

automated CRN explorations by investigating two model reactions of ozone with ethene and

100

tetramethylethene, respectively. These processes were selected as benchmarks because they

101

both proceed through the Criegee mechanism but generate different stable products under

102

identical experimental conditions. 38 Here, we performed the CRN evaluation with methods

103

identified in specific objective (i) and evaluated their utility for future automated CRN ex-

104

plorations involving ozone and organic compounds. (iii) Finally, we analysed the outcome

105

for the lowest energy path reaction mechanism between the reactants and the experimentally

106

observed products with Pathfinder 33 as well as through microkinetic modeling. 34

Computational Methodology

108

Quantum Chemical Calculations

109

Density functional theory and coupled cluster calculations were performed with the ORCA

110

software package version 5.0.3. 43 We also tested three semiempirical methods, namely DFTB3, 44

111

PM6 45 and GNF2-xTB. 32 We have not considered the application of multireference configu-

112

ration interaction methods because of the two following limitations. First, molecular orbitals

113

that form the complete active space must be consistent for all the molecular structures along

114

a reaction path, hence new methodologies are currently under development to provide direct

115

orbital selection mapping. 46 Second, multireference methods are notorious for being among

116

the most time-demanding calculations in quantum chemistry. 47 Given that pioneering studies

117

demonstrated that CC succeeded in both optimizing the molecular structures and predicting

118

the reaction energies of the Criegee mechanism for ozone and ethene, we have followed their

119

recommendation. 41,42 DFT structure optimizations were done with Perdew-Becke-Ernzerhof

120

PBE, 48,49 the hybrid PBE0, 50 and the long-range LC-PBE 51 density functionals, with the

121

Ahlrichs def2-TZVP basis set. 52 Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction was employed for the

122

PBE and PBE0 calculations. 53,54 Single point calculations were performed with canonical

123

coupled cluster, CCSD(T), 55 and the Domain-based Local Pair Natural Orbital approxi-

124

mation of coupled cluster, DLPNO-CCSD(T) 56 with the correlation consistent basis sets. 57

125

Because the reaction network contains both open- and closed-shell compounds, we employed

126

the DLPNO approach, instead of the DPNO, to ensure that we can combine their absolute

127

electronic energies when calculating reaction energies. We employed the default protocol

128

in ORCA, where UHF alpha and beta orbitals are transformed to quasi-restricted orbitals,

129

thus removing much of the spin contamination. Solvation in water was introduced using

130

the Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model, CPCM, both for structure optimization

131

and single point calculations. 58 Stationary points were characterized with analytic frequency

132

calculations. Gibbs energy corrections were computed using LC-PBE, at 298.15 K and 1

133

atm, and using the ideal gas-rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator (IGRRHO) model. Final Gibbs

134

energies were calculated combining the electronic energy from DLPNO-CCSD(T), and the

135

Gibbs energy corrections from the DFT method. In order to employ molar concentrations in

136

the rate constant, the reference state was modified to 298.15 K and 1.0 M (standard state in

137

solution). Given that the temperature remains constant between both states, this was done

138

by simply increasing the barrier by 7.90 kJ·mol−1 . 59

139

Reaction Network Exploration

140

We carried out autonomous reaction network explorations with ethene and ozone as well as

141

tetramethylethene and ozone using the SCINE Chemoton module. 60 An introduction to

142

the terminology, the principles of CRN construction, and the characterization of CRNs is

143

provided in Section S1 of the Supporting Information. Briefly, CRN explorations generate

144

four datasets. (i) A structure is a single identity defined by a set of atoms distributed in the

145

three-dimensional space with a determined spin and charge. (ii) A compound is a group of

146

structures with same number of atoms, charge and spin but different electronic energies. (iii)

147

The elementary step represents a rearrangement of chemical bonds and electrons between

148

two structures connected via a transition state (TS). Finally, (iv) reactions comprise a group

149

of elementary steps connecting two compounds through a transition state (Figure S1).

150

To generate transition state guesses for uni- and bimolecular reactions, we employed the

151

algorithm implemented in Chemoton named Newton Trajectory scan (NT2), which is in-

152

spired by the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR), 61 and the use of Newtonian forces for

153

computing an effective PES. 62 We restricted the size of the compounds in the two networks

154

as follows. NT2 trials that led to activation barriers greater than 250 kJ·mol−1 (according to

155

the method which was used for the exploration) were dismissed, as the subsequent reaction

156

would be unlikely to happen. The activation barrier threshold was set relatively high to ac-

157

count for two phenomena. First, electronic structure methods can overestimate experimental

158

barrier heights. Too low thresholds could lead to reactions being overlooked. Second, the

159

identification of barriers occurs regardless of the direction in which they might be crossed.

160

Endergonic reactions with high barriers can still represent exergonic reactions in the oppo-

161

site direction. The chemical reaction network of ethene and ozone (CRN-E) contained a

162

maximum of 2 carbon atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms (i.e., the ozonide) to

163

reduce the computational cost of the exploration (see further discussion below and Section

164

S2.2). CRN-T for reactions of tetramethylethene and ozone was made up of a maximum of

165

6 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. This threshold has two hydrogen

166

atoms more than the tetramethylethene-ozonide, in order to allow the search for the relevant

167

transformation product, 2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol. We stopped the explorations once the

168

expected, experimentally confirmed products were found.

169

All calculations were handled by SCINE Puffin instances 63 and stored and processed

170

in the SCINE Database. 64 These instances interface three additional SCINE packages:

171

ReaDuct, 65 for communicating with ORCA’s generation of input and output files, Mo-

172

lassembler, 66 for handling molecular structures, and Utilities 67 which contains a broad

173

variety of functionalities essential for all SCINE modules. We monitored the progress of

174

the reaction exploration with the open-source graphical user interface Heron, 68,69 and the

175

reaction networks can be interactively visualized as standalone HTML files generated with

176

VizChemoton. 70 A detailed description of the parameters employed in the exploration is

177

provided in Section S2.2.

178

CRN Characterization

179

CRN-E and CRN-T were characterized with reaction pathway identification and kinetic anal-

180

yses. An analysis of equilibrium species distributions based on thermodynamic stability was

181

not conducted, as ozonation of olefins is driven by fast kinetics. We employed Pathfinder

182

and its built-in cost function to determine the most favorable reaction mechanisms. 33 For

183

the kinetics analyses we used microkinetic simulations with KiNetX’s original Matlab code

184

(see parameters in Section S2.7). 34 Initial concentrations for both the pathway identification

and kinetic analysis were set to 4.97·10−5 M of ozone, 4.97·10−3 M of the model olefin, and

Results and Discussion

188

Choice of Quantum Chemistry Methodology

189

Reference Reaction

190

To determine the adequate quantum chemistry method for the reaction exploration, we

191

evaluated the performance of a broad range of methods, focusing on the first step of the

192

ozonolysis reaction. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of ozone to the double bond of the olefin

193

leads to an ozonide intermediate. Figure 1 shows the mechanism of the ozonolysis, known

194

as the Criegee mechanism, 71 for the two olefins, ethene and tetramethylethene, selected in

195

this study. We used as reference the data reported by Wheeler et al. 41 on the 1,3-dipolar

196

cycloaddition reactions, which consisted of the molecular structures of ozone, ethene, and

197

the TS, as well as the corresponding activation energy (14.2 kJ·mol−1 ). Moreover, Figure

198

1 depicts the expected products for the aqueous ozonolysis of ethene (formaldehyde and α-

199

hydroxymethylhydroperoxide) and tetramethylethene (acetone and hydrogen peroxide). The

200

final products of the ozonolysis and their yields reported in Dowideit and von Sonntag 38 are

201

used in the final section of this study to validate the outcome of the CRN exploration in

202

kinetic simulations.

203

Transition State Structure Optimization

204

We tested three semiempirical methods, DFTB3, PM6 and GFN2-xTB, and three versions

205

of the Perdew-Becke-Ernzerhof functional, PBE, PBE0, and LC-PBE, to optimize the tran-

206

sition state structure leading to the ozonide in the first part of the method benchmarking

207

step. We did not employ CC methods to optimize molecular structures because calculations

208

would become too slow. Figure 2 shows the the results of structure and energy benchmarks

Figure 1: Ozonolysis of ethene and tetramethylethene through the ozonide intermediate
(1). The Criegee mechanism 71 proceeds either directly with a heterolytic cleavage forming a
carbonyl compound and an alkyliumperoxolate (3) or via a zwitterionic intermediate (2), the
latter leading to aldehyde and α-hydroxyl-alkylperoxide (5) in presence of water as solvent,
and to the Criegee ozonide (4) in apolar solvents. 38

that we conducted to identify the optimal quantum chemistry methodology for ensuing CRN

210

explorations. The data in Figure 2 demonstrate that no single quantum chemistry method si-

211

multaneously offers low deviations in molecular structures and electronic energies. Therefore,

212

it is necessary to define a composite approach, where molecular structures are optimized first

213

with one method, and electronic energies are subsequently calculated with a second method.

214

Figure 2A shows the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the TS structures optimized

215

with the aforementioned methods, with respect to the reference TS structure of Wheeler

216

et al. 41 DFTB3 provides a molecular structure with a RMSD above 1.04 Å, followed by PM6

217

(0.59 Å). GFN2-xTB outperforms the two previous semiempirical methods with a RMSD of

218

0.20 Å. Neither PBE nor PBE0 succeeded in converging the TS structure, whereas LC-PBE

219

not only locates the TS structure, but also provides the lowest RMSD (0.03 Å). Considering

220

that commonly used RMSD thresholds range from 0.5 to 2.0 Å, 72 only GFN2-xTB and

Figure 2: Benchmark of 14 quantum chemistry methods sorted from the fastest (top) to
the slowest calculation (bottom). RMSD of the optimized structures are shown with respect
to the reference TS structure (panel A) and single point energy deviations relative to the
reference activation energy of the ozonide formation (panel B), both provided by of Wheeler
et al. 41 (14.2 kJ·mol−1 ). The green rectangle depicts the range of chemical accuracy of ±4.18
kJ·mol−1 .
221

LC-PBE are meaningful candidates for running the reaction exploration. The former is

222

on average 100 times faster than the latter, however, LC-PBE is approximately 10 times

223

more accurate than GFN2-xTB. The excellent performance of LC-PBE is explained by the

224

accurate electronic structures for zwitterionic compounds predicted with range-separated

225

functionals. 73 This point is particularly relevant since not only does ozone exhibit partly

226

zwitterionic character, 74 but also many products of the reaction network are zwitterions.

227

Considering that standard quantum chemistry methods (PBE and PBE0) failed to locate the

228

TS and that semiempirical methods are persistently inaccurate for complex bond-breaking

229

processes, we employed LC-PBE for finding and optimizing the molecular structures in our

230

CRN explorations.

231

Accuracy of Transition State Energies

We have evaluated the performance of 14 quantum chemistry methods (3 semiempirical

233

methods, 3 DFT functionals, 4 DLPNO CC, and 4 canonical CC) to predict the activation

234

energy of the ozonide. Figure 2B shows how the electronic energies calculated with the 14

235

methods, using single point calculations with the reference structures from Wheeler et al. 41 ,

236

deviate from the reference value of 14.2 kJ·mol−1 . 41 Deviations vary substantially for the 3

237

semiempirical methods from −83.6 kJ·mol−1 for GFN2-xTB to 0.08 kJ·mol−1 for PM6. We

238

attribute PM6’s high accuracy to its parametrization with CC energy data of its non-covalent

239

interactions. 75 The energy deviations of DFT calculations, that is PBE, PBE0 and LC-PBE

240

are −29.9, −19.1, and −10.1 kJ·mol−1 , respectively. This energy trend follows the Jacob’s

241

ladder principle by which a more precise treatment of the exchange-correlation term enhances

242

the prediction of the electronic energy. 76 However, none of the activation energies calculated

243

with these methods are within the chemical accuracy range of ±4.18 kJ·mol−1 . 77 The poor

244

accuracy of TS energy calculations with DFT functionals in this type of reactivity agrees with

245

a previous benchmark study. 22 Only data obtained from DLPNO and canonical CC resulted

246

in reliable TS activation energies, as depicted with a green rectangle in Figure 2B. Despite

247

the fact that DLPNO is an approximation of the canonical CC, the former demonstrates a

248

similar accuracy to the latter, even when pvtz CCSD(T) is approximately three times slower

249

than pvtz DLPNO-CCSD(T) (Figure S4). In fact, the wall clock time of the canonical

250

CC rapidly scales exponentially for molecules with more than 20 atoms, whereas DLPNO

251

CC scales linearly even with molecules up to 1000 atoms. 78 Moreover, complete basis set

252

extrapolations (CBS) shows a higher deviation than the triple and quadruple zeta basis sets.

253

Data in Figure S4 also illustrates that pvqz DLPNO-CCSD(T) is 4.1 times more accurate

254

than pvtz DLPNO-CCSD(T), however, it is also 4.7 times more expensive. Based on this

255

evidence, electronic energies in our CRN explorations were calculated with pvtz DLPNO-

256

CCSD(T).

Exploration Outcomes

260

The CRN exploration initiated through the reaction of ethene with ozone, with LC-PBE for

261

structures and DLPNO-CCSD(T) for energies, generated 595 compounds and 1350 reactions

262

(Table 1). The serial computing time for the CRN-E exploration, that is the time invested

263

in all the calculations of the CRN exploration on a hypothetical single processor core, 35

264

was 28500 days (Table 1). Given that computations are run in parallel, the effective total

265

computing time using an average of 250 cores was 114 days.

266

We assessed the plausibility of structures generated for CRN-E in analogy to the compu-

267

tational benchmarking process with experimental evidence for the detected reaction prod-

268

ucts. 20,38 Table 1 shows that the exploration for CRN-E found the the key compounds

269

pertinent to the ozonolysis reactions, namely the ozonide, formaldehyde, methyliumper-

270

oxolate, α-hydroxymethylhydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. Chemoton successfully

umperoxolate (3 in Figure 1), was not included at the start of the exploration but generated

274

by Chemoton. Lastly, water was found to be involved in 59 reactions, thus demonstrating

275

the consistency of the autonomous exploration procedure.

276

Representing the complete network of CRN-E in a single yet meaningful Figure is not

277

doable given the large number of reactions and compounds (Table 1). Here, we illustrate the

278

initial steps with the involved compounds, flasks, and transition states (Figures 3 and S7)

279

leading to the ozonide and the reactions of the ozonolysis reaction path (Figures S5 and S6).

Figure 3 depicts the three initial reactions of CRN-E (orange arrows), one association

(yellow arrow), five compounds (green circles) and one flask (blue circle). The exploration

287

starts by pushing together ozone and ethene to form flask A1, which was already found by

288

Wheeler et al. 41 as vdW complex. This pre-reactant complex forms three different com-

pounds through three distinct transition states. The three-dimensional structures of the

290

transition states are depicted in the orange boxes of Figure 3. The exploration procedure

identified the most critical compound, the ozonide, C3, through reaction R1, in good agree-

296

The exploration for tetramethylethene and ozone, CRN-T, generated 388 compounds

297

and 441 reactions (Table 1). The serial computing time for the CRN-T exploration was

298

11600 days, and the total computing time, using an average of 250 cores, was reduced

299

to approximately 47 days. We compared some structures generated for CRN-T with the

300

initial steps leading to the tetramethylethene ozonide intermediate in analogy to the CRN-E

301

evaluation. CRN-T contains the key compounds depicted in Figure 1, thus confirming that

302

the product hypothesis is also met for this exploration. The CRN-T exploration also found

303

water as compound. Figure S7 shows an analogous representation of Figure 3 for CRN-T,

304

where the key ozonide compounds and their transition states were successfully identified.

305

However, one experimentally reported transformation product was not found, corresponding

306

to the product of the partial oxidation of tetramethylethene: 2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol. 38

307

In fact, the reaction exploration did not find any diol compound.

308

We hypothesize that the CRN-T did not find any diol and, presumably, other intermedi-

309

ates and products because of the inherently vast chemical space. This chemical space would

310

not be accessible within the time frame of our computations with LC-PBE based struc-

311

ture searches. To that end, we ran a separate, reaction exploration starting from tetram-

312

ethylethene and ozone using GFN2-xTB instead of LC-PBE (abbreviated CRN-T-xTB in

313

Table 1). The computing time running on 250 cores was approximately 6 days (1436 days

314

of serial computing), and during that short period of calculation time, it found 133426 re-

315

actions and 68721 compounds. Chemoton indeed generated eight different diols (Figure

316

S8), but only after CRN-T-xTB included over 40000 reactions vs. 441 reaction with CRN-T,

317

that is a 100-fold increased depth of the exploration. Further qualitative evidence for the

318

operational limitations of LC-PBE-based CRN explorations was obtained from the consider-

319

ation of typical intermediates of the aqueous ozone chemistry. CRN-T-xTB found additional

320

important products associated with the general decay of ozone not included in CRN-T such

321

as the hydroxyl radical, the superoxide radical and the ozonide radical (Figure S9). Further-

322

more, Figure S9 illustrates that singlet and triplet dioxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and water

323

were also present in CRN-T, but involved in a 2- to almost 400-fold lesser frequency than

324

in reactions of CRN-T-xTB. These intermediates did not matter for the reaction of ethene

325

and tetramethylethene with ozone studied here but would do so in ozonation processes with

326

substrates with lower ozone reactivities than olefins. The exploration of the reactions of

327

these ozone decay intermediates, however, was beyond the scope of this study.

328

Reaction Rate Constants

329

The DLPNO-CCSD(T) energy calculations for the 1350 reaction in CRN-E enabled us to

330

obtain 2700 forward and backward reaction rates constants for the reactions of 595 com-

331

pounds in the network. Figure 4A shows the unimodal exponential distribution of reaction

334

kJ·mol−1 , which is equivalent to 44 orders of magnitude in reaction rate constants. The peak

335

of the distribution is roughly at 25 kJ·mol−1 and the majority of reactions have an energy

336

of <80 kJ·mol−1 . Consequently, most reactions have half-lives, t1/2 , of 12 seconds at room

337

temperature (eq. 1).

343

CRN-E has 1710 associations, 520 dissociations and 470 bond rearrangements.

340

344

A similar ratio between the three reaction types, that is the predominance of association

345

reactions was also found for CRN-T despite the smaller number of compounds and reactions.

346

Figure 4B depicts the bimodal exponential distribution of reaction rate constants according

347

to the activation energies. The two peaks of maximum counts of activation energies in Figure

348

4B are centered at 8 and 75 kJ·mol−1 , respectively. Because the peak at 8 kJ·mol−1 is the

349

highest, we deduce that CRN-T contains a relative larger share of fast reactions compared

350

to CRN-E.

351

While Chemoton allows for the autonomous construction of CRNs, the large uncer-

352

tainty of quantum chemistry methods for predicting absolute values of rate constants still

353

remains. 79 To exemplify issues with absolute rate constants for the CRNs studied here, we

also observed in the exponential decrease of ozone, as it reacts slower than expected from

experimental data (Figure S10). The mismatch between experimental and theoretical data

is even more pronounced for tetramethylethene. Because only a lower limit of this second18

(Figure S7) to yield the vdW flask and the ozonide, depicted as purple and a red verti-

366

cal lines, respectively. Another important consideration is that association reactions suffer

367

QC-R1
from an entropic penalty. 80 On the one hand, the formation of the vdW flask, kO
, is
3

368

entropically unfavorable, as two reactants, ozone and the olefin, are transformed into one

product, the vdW flask. On the other hand, for kO

3

370

to form the ozonide compound (brown vertical line for kO
in Figure 4B), the outcome is re3

371

versed. These pieces of evidence highlight the fundamental challenge of predicting accurate

372

absolute reaction rate constants with quantum chemistry methods. It thus cannot be the

373

goal of CRN explorations to provide and evaluate individual activation barriers for selected

374

reactions in terms of bimolecular rate constants. Instead, rate constants calculated with the

375

same method (here DLPNO-CCSD(T)), can be used as relative values because they benefit

376

from error cancellation. 59 Relative activation energies are thus consistent and enable one to

377

carry out reaction pathway and mechanisms evaluations as well as microkinetic modeling

378

which we will present in the next section.

Reaction Mechanisms and Kinetics

380

Reaction Pathway Identification

381

Figure 5 shows two sets of the 25 most probable reaction mechanisms generated with

382

Pathfinder for CRN-E and CRN-T in panels A and B, respectively, using initial con-

383

centrations from Dowideit and von Sonntag 38 (4.97 · 10−5 M of ozone and 4.97 · 10−3 M of

384

olefin). The most likely mechanism, deduced from a compound cost function that stands

385

for the compound’s availability for a reaction, 33 is highlighted in dark blue color, while all

386

other reaction pathways are depicted in grey. The cost has arbitrary units and it is inversely

387

related to the likelihood of the mechanism. In this reaction pathway identification, ozone

388

with ethene and tetramethylethene, respectively, were defined as sources whereas the hy19

Figure 5: Reaction mechanism prediction by Pathfinder: (A) from ozone and ethene to
α-hydroxymethylhydroperoxide and from (B) ozone and tetramethylethene to 2-hydroxy-2propylhydroperoxide. The mechanism with the lowest cost is depicted in dark blue color.
Grey bars and lines represent alternative reaction mechanisms with higher compound costs.
389

droxyalkylhydroperoxides were defined arbitrarily as targets which will further decompose

390

in water. 81 The selection of the same type of target for both CRNs allows for a direct com-

391

parison of the reaction mechanisms with experimental evidence (i.e., for reactions leading to

392

compound 5 in Figure 1).

393

Figure 5A shows the most favorable mechanism from the reaction of ozone and ethene

394

(source) to α-hydroxymethylhydroperoxide (target). The other 24 alternative mechanisms

395

are depicted in grey because Pathfinder classifies them as unlikely due to their greater

396

compound costs (see elementary steps of reaction paths in Section S2.6.1). Mechanism 1

397

depicted in Figure 5A is spontaneous, with a total reaction Gibbs energy of –365 kJ·mol−1 .

398

This reaction pathway starts with the barrierless formation of the vdW complex (Int1 in Fig-

399

ure 5). The subsequent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition through TS1 exhibits an activation barrier

400

of 34 kJ·mol−1 . As a result, the ozonide (Int2) is formed, with a favorable reaction energy of

401

–258 kJ·mol−1 . Next, the ozonide decomposes through heterolytic O–O bond cleavage in TS2

402

with a barrier of +32 kJ·mol−1 to generate a flask composed by formaldehyde and methyli-

403

umperoxolate. After the dissociation of the flask, Int4, methyliumperoxolate reacts with

404

water to generate a new flask, Int5. In the final reaction step, Int5 evolves through TS3,

405

with an activation barrier of 27 kJ·mol−1 , to yield α-hydroxymethylhydroperoxide (Int6).

406

Despite the fact that the Pathfinder mechanism is not the lowest in energy (there are

407

other pathways in Figure 5 with lower energy), it is indeed the shortest and the most favor-

408

able when considering both the activation barriers (i.e., kinetics) and initial concentrations

409

of the reactants. Moreover, the alternative mechanisms show that there is a consistent trend

410

in terms of total reaction Gibbs energy. For example, mechanism 25 (see Section S2.6.1)

411

has a cost of 159.9 compared to 124.8 for mechanism 1. The difference stems from the fact

412

that mechanism 25 includes an additional reaction step. For CRN-E, the formation of the

413

α-hydroxymethylhydroperoxide is exergonic for all the reaction pathways shown in Figure

414

5A.

415

The most favorable reaction mechanism from ozone and tetramethylethene to 2-hydroxy-

416

2-propylhydroperoxide is shown in Figure 5B. 24 alternative mechanisms are depicted in

417

grey and exhibit greater compound costs. For instance, mechanism 25 illustrated in Section

418

S2.6.2 has a cost of 288.5 as compared to 104.4 for mechanism 1. This large difference is

419

not only caused by the extra reaction step of mechanism 25, but also by the formation of

420

hydrogen which is not observed in experiments. 38 Mechanism 1 starts with the barrierless

421

formation of the vdW complex (Int1) and then undergoes a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition through

422

TS1 with an activation energy of 4 kJ·mol−1 to generate the Criegee ozonide (Int2). Note

423

that the activation barrier for TS1 from tetramethylethene is 30 kJ·mol−1 lower than TS1

424

from ethene, in good agreement with the higher reactivity of tetramethylethene reported in

21

425

exp
experiments 38 (see kO
-values in Figure 4). The ozonide decomposes through the heterolytic
3

426

cleavage reaction, via TS2, to form a flask composed by acetone and 2-peroxopropylate. The

427

flask dissociates to form Int4. Subsequently, 2-peroxopropylate forms yet a new flask with

428

water, Int5 which yields 2-hydroxy-2-propylhydroperoxide through TS3 with an activation

429

barrier of 28 kJ·mol−1 . This reaction mechanism is not spontaneous because the ozonide

430

(Int2) is 71 kJ·mol−1 more stable than the final product 2-hydroxy-2-propylhydroperoxide.

431

Alternative reaction pathways found by Pathfinder also show the same endergonic trend

432

towards the formation of the 2-hydroxy-2-propylhydroperoxide. This observation reveals

433

the principle difference between the reaction mechanisms of ozone with tetramethylethene

434

and ethene, respectively. While the formation of hydroxyalkylhydroperoxides is favored for

435

CRN-E, it is not for CRN-T. This interpretation perfectly agrees with the experimental

436

data, as α-hydroxymethylhydroperoxide is one of the main products whereas 2-hydroxy-2-

437

propylhydroperoxide is not. 38

438

Microkinetic Analyses

439

While the reaction pathway identification relies on an explicit definition of source and target

440

compounds, microkinetic simulations are literally exploratory within the network of gen-

441

erated compounds, flasks, and transition states. Here, we employed KiNetX 34 to carry

442

out microkinetic analyses for CRN-E and CRN-T and the outcome is depicted in Figure 6.

443

The initial conditions are identical to those used for reaction pathway identification from

444

experiments of Dowideit and von Sonntag 38 with excess of olefins and water. The kinetic

445

parameters and initial concentrations are compiled in Table S2.

446

Figure 6A shows the reaction kinetics of compounds exceeding femto-molar concentra-

447

tions in CRN-E that included all compounds and reactions included in Table 1. Typical inter-

448

mediates of ethene ozonolysis (i.e., the ozonide, α-hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide, methylium

449

peroxolate) are formed continuously until they decrease as ozone is consumed completely

450

(between 1 to 100 seconds). Formaldehyde and α-hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide are the fi-

451

nal products of this reaction and they form in the correct equimolar yields. This accurate

452

reproduction of experimental transformation products 38 was obtained even though reaction

453

QC
rate constants, such as those for the ozone consumption (kO
in Figure 4), deviate orders of
3

454

magnitude from measured rate constants. Our data thus confirms the error cancellation in

455

transition state energy calculations invoked above.

456

Note that we combined DLPNO-CCSD(T) electronic energies with LC-PBE entropy

457

corrections in our microkinetic simulations to calculate Gibbs energies. 82,83 When reaction

458

rates are exclusively calculated with LC-PBE Gibbs energies, the resulting kinetic simula-

459

tions lead to the formation of the Criegee ozonide as predominant final product (Figures

460

S11A and S12A for CRN-E and CRN-T, respectively). None of these calculations match

461

experimental evidence. 38 These observations reinforces results from our QC method bench-

462

marking (Figure 2B) which show that LC-PBE electronic energies do not ensure chemical

463

accuracy in simulations of ozone chemistry. When reaction rate constants are calculated us-

464

ing DLPNO-CCSD(T) electronic energies only, the microkinetic simulations form the correct

465

compounds but in flasks instead of compounds (Figures S11B and S11B). Electronic energies

466

do not favor dissociation reactions of flasks due to the lack of the entropic contribution.

467

Figure 6B shows the kinetics of compounds in CRN-T from a microkinetic simulation

468

carried out in analogous fashion as for CRN-E (see Table 1 for number of compounds and

469

reactions and Table S2 for simulation parameters). This microkinetic analysis is based on

470

exploration data with a confined set of identified compounds (see above). Even though the

471

lower depth of CRN-T is a limitation to the network’s evaluation, these results allow for

472

critical insights into the interpretation of automatic CRN explorations. In CRN-T, tetram-

473

ethylethene and ozone react to acetone as primary product through decomposition of the

474

tetramethylethene-ozonide via heterolytic O–O bond cleavage in agreement with experi-

475

ments. 38 The fact that the hydroxy-alkyl hydroperoxide (2-hydroxypropyl-2-hydroperoxide)

476

does not become the predominant product is also consistent with experiments. However,

477

formation of two unexpected compounds, 3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-1,2,4,5-tetroxane, simply re-

478

ferred to as tetroxane (Gibbs energy of –227 kJ·mol−1 , Figure S13A) and propenylperoxy-

479

propaneperoxol (–277 kJ·mol−1 , Figure S13B) vs. –218 kJ·mol−1 for the ozonide (Figure

480

5) hint at limited extent of reaction progress or lacking depth of CRN-T exploration. We

481

hypothesize that this outcome is also due to an artifact with regard to the role that water

482

plays in the hydrolysis of the alkyliumperoxolate (i.e., the 2-peroxo propylate zwitterion in

483

CRN-T) to hydrogen peroxide and acetone (3 in Figure 1).

484

As discussed in Section S2.11, the transition state leading to the formation of hydrogen

485

peroxide from 2-peroxopropylate strongly depends on the position of the attacking water

486

(Figure S15). The need for aligning water to the hydrolysis reaction coordinate artificially

487

increases the activation energy thus ultimately hindering the reaction. We note that this

488

issue does not systematically affect reaction of water in general. For example, in the hy-

489

drolysis reaction with 2-peroxopropylate to form 2-hydroxy-2-propylhydroperoxide, water

490

attacks from an optimal angle, leading to a smooth trajectory on the potential energy sur-

to elucidate reactions of ozone with organic compounds in aqueous solution. Insights from

497

the evaluation of reactions of tetramethylethene with ozone, however, revealed bottlenecks

498

that need to be addressed in improved computational and data processing workflows for

499

more expansive CRN exploration of chemical oxidation processes. Examples include the

500

efficient combination of fast semiempirical electronic structure calculations with DFT and

501

CC methods to arrive at reliable structures and minimum/TS energies of structurally more

502

complex compounds than substituted ethenes, the management of the ensuing large datasets

503

for evaluation and visualization, as well as the handling of water as both solvent and reactant.

504

Once established, CRN evaluations of chemical oxidation processes can support the re-

505

evaluation of reactions of many organic compounds of concern in oxidative water and wastew-

506

ater treatment processes. Even though sophisticated chemical analyses, such as non-target

507

analysis by high resolution mass spectrometry, generates numerous structural features of

508

organic transformation products, 88 such approaches are unable to provide a comprehensive

509

view of the identity of the numerous intermediates and products (e.g., from drinking water

510

ozonation processes 15 ). The numerous compounds acquired in CRN databases might prove

511

highly beneficial for prediction of high resolution mass spectra, for example if combined with

512

deep learning-based approaches developed for this purpose. 89

513

Moreover, (eco)toxicity evaluations recommend circumventing the assignment of the ob-

514

served toxicity to chemicals in polluted and treated waters because only a minor fraction

515

of the observed toxicity can be allocated to individual compounds in mixtures of pollu-

516

tants and their transformation products. 90 The prediction of transformation products and

517

coupling this information to biodegradability assessment is a critial step in the evaluation of

518

their abatement in biofilters, which are common after ozonation. Chemical reaction networks

519

generated through high-throughput computational chemistry have great potential to address

520

knowledge gaps in (eco)toxicity evaluations by providing atomistic evidence on transient

521

chemical species and potentially overlooked transformation products. Finally, we envision

522

that predictions of potentially harmful or toxic compounds or compound (sub)structures

523

from CRN explorations of oxidative water treatment could become pivotal for the evaluation

524

of environmental impacts of chemicals in early design phases. 91
