Leading strategies for the capture of CO2 from point sources and directly from the atmosphere

8

confront the challenge of high energy costs for thermal sorbent regeneration. In response,

9

photochemical processes driven by sunlight as the sole external stimulus have recently been advanced

10

as a promising alternative. Although many examples of light-induced pH swings using metastable

11

photoacids have been reported, the complementary mode of operation, using photoswitchable bases,

12

has not been extensively considered due in part to the rarity of photobases that can support large,

13

reversible pH jumps in water. Here, we report the design of fluorenol-based Arrhenius photobases that

14

take advantage of excited-state aromaticity and ground-state antiaromaticity to generate large basicity

15

swings (nearly 6 pH units) with high reversibility (ca. 1% degradation per cycle). The system is stable

16

to oxygen, can be driven by natural sunlight, and is shown to concentrate CO2 from ambient air. To

17

understand the high efficiency (>20% photochemical quantum yield) of hydroxide release, the

18

mechanism of C–O dissociation was elucidated using transient-absorption spectroscopy. This study

19

provides a general framework for the design of photoreversible aqueous bases and guiding principles

20

for their usage in solar-powered CO2 management.

Introduction

22

As the most significant driver of anthropogenic climate change, atmospheric CO2 needs to be

23

dramatically reduced to avoid catastrophic future scenarios.1–3 Hence, chemical systems for removing

24

CO2 from emission streams and even directly from the atmosphere (direct air capture, DAC) are of

25

practical significance.4–7 Leading technologies rely on nucleophilic solvents such as alkaline aqueous

26

solutions and amines (e.g., ethanolamine) or on porous sorbents with nucleophilic functionalities, both

27

of which form strong covalent adducts with CO2.8,9 To regenerate the stationary phase and release the

28

captured CO2, energy-intensive thermal stripping is the most popular method.10 Though these systems

29

are becoming increasingly efficient and scalable, there is considerable interest in alternative approaches

30

using materials that cycle between capture and release modes using nonthermal stimuli, including

31

applied electrical potentials,11 humidity swings,12 microwave irradiation,13 and photochemistry.14 These

32

newer approaches can in principle have advantages in terms of energy efficiency, but the underlying

33

thermodynamic and molecular-design principles are substantially less developed than for thermally

34

driven systems.

35

Switchable organic molecules regulated by visible light have attracted attention recently in this

36

context, specifically those that reversibly release protons, such as spiropyran photochromes, which we

37

and others have examined for reversible CO2 capture.14–17 By directly converting solar energy and thus

38

avoiding the intermediate generation, storage, and distribution of clean electricity, photochemical

39

separations could eventually be efficient and distributable options for some applications, although

40

dramatic increases in photon utilization, stability, and capture/release kinetics are still required.

41

Furthermore, while photoacids demonstrate important fundamental principles for coupling

42

photoswitching with light-independent equilibria, their inability to operate at high pH is a fundamental

43

limitation inasmuch as they can only capture CO2 from concentrated streams and are likely inapplicable

44

for DAC without additional alkaline sorbents.17

45

As part of our research on direct light-driven separations, we considered whether the opposite

46

mode of operation, involving photobases that display reversible photon-induced release of hydroxide,

47

might represent a more promising mechanism for carbon capture. An especially appealing aspect of

48

such a scheme is that the photochemical step (hydroxide release) is unimolecular and CO2-independent

49

and therefore, may proceed with high quantum efficiencies with the judicious design of the photobase.

50

In contrast, we have shown that photoacidic mechanisms necessarily involve, after light-triggered

51

proton release, a competition between bimolecular proton recapture by the dye and bicarbonate

52

protonation.14 A further advantage of a photobasic scheme is that high concentrations of hydroxide could

53

be achieved with a sufficiently soluble and photoreactive dye, setting the stage for capture from dilute

54

streams.

55

Electrochemically switched systems have been reported that depend on the reversible

56

generation of hydroxide and corresponding pH swing in the alkaline direction.11,18–20 Solutions

57

containing redox-active bases, such as phenazines, have been shown to undergo large pH increases upon

58

reduction, enabling separation of CO2 from very dilute streams.21–23 A major limitation of

59

electrochemical strategies is the oxygen-instability of many reduced species in aqueous solution,

60

although promising progress has been made using alcohol additives in organic solvent.23,24 We

61

postulated that a photoswitchable base could in principle achieve similar cyclic pH swings in aqueous

62

solution without the problems of oxygen sensitivity nor the requirement for electrochemical apparatus

63

such as cells, membranes, electrodes, and supporting electrolytes. However, while metastable-state

64

photoacids such as merocyanines have been continuously optimized over the past decades, and

65

extensive physical-organic studies have been performed on their use as photoswitchable buffers, 25

66

analogous research on switchable photobases is rather limited. Several Brønsted photobases, mainly

67

consisting of quinolines and acridines, have been discovered, and Lukas et al. showed a guanidine

68

Brønsted photobase could form reversible adducts with CO2 in acetonitrile solution using light.

69

However, Brønsted photobases predominantly function in organic solvent, rely on UV light and exhibit

70

small shifts in pKa (~2 units), thereby limiting their utility in reversible CO2 capture.26–30

71

In this work, we show that a new class of reversible hydroxide emitters, 9-aryl-9-fluorenols,

72

represent among the first highly reversible and tuneable Arrhenius photobases, capable of generating

73

large pH swings reaching ca. pH 12 under illumination. We report the effect of ground state pKa on the

74

efficiency of capture and release, validating a precise pH-matching principle that we had developed in

75

the context of photoacids.14 Solutions of these materials can capture CO2 from streams as dilute as 400

76

ppm and then release that captured CO2 upon removal of the light source, resulting in output

77

concentrations that are significantly higher than the input stream. Studies into the effects of excited-

78

state aromaticity, ground-state antiaromaticity, and the transient dynamics provide insight into the

design principles underlying the effectiveness of these photobases for reversible CO2 capture compared

to previously known hydroxide emitters.

Acridinols, trityl alcohols, and fluorenols are examples of molecular switches that

92

photochemically and reversibly release hydroxide.31–34 The best-known Arrhenius photobase, malachite

green carbinol base (MGCB), reported by Irie in 1982, was found to engender large reversible pH

94

swings by toggling between a neutral alcohol state and photoionized ion pair of a trityl carbocation and

hydroxide, formed upon C–O heterolysis.34 This behaviour has been used to effect conformational

96

changes in DNA/RNA and in light-driven drug-release applications, but otherwise, limited follow-up

97

work has been published.35–37 We wondered whether the photoinduced pH swing of MGCB could be

98

utilised to reversibly capture CO2 and accordingly, our attempts initially focused on engineering the

99

structure of MGCB to satisfy the criteria of efficient CO2 capture under photoirradiation and CO2

100

release in darkness (Figure 1a).

101

A 1 mM solution of MGHOH in 2:1 MeCN/water was irradiated with UV light (λexc = 254 nm)

102

under rapid stirring, resulting in a pH jump from 7.0 to 10.8 over the course of 5 min (Figure 1c, green

103

trace). Upon removal of the light source, the solution pH decreased to 8.7 over the next 5 min. Thus,

104

MGHOH undergoes significant but not complete photodissociation in response to UV light and partial

105

recombination in the dark suggesting its promise for the development of photoreversible CO2 capture.

106

However, when MGHOH solutions were exposed to CO2 (1 atm) in the dark, a large and irreversible

107

prompt absorbance at 620 nm was observed that is characteristic of the corresponding carbocation

108

(Figure 1b, green trace).38 The carbocation evolution indicates the transfer of hydroxide from MGHOH

109

to CO2, generating a carbocation-bicarbonate ion pair. Thus, MGHOH is too basic and is

110

thermodynamically unlikely to release CO2 in the absence of illumination. In line with this supposition,

111

a spectrophotometric titration (SI Figure 3) determined the pKaH´ of MGHOH to be 6.8. We sought to

112

reduce the pKaH´ by destabilising the carbocation via para-functionalization of the phenyl group with

113

electron-withdrawing substituents, Br and CF3. Whereas MGBrOH solutions (1 mM in 2:1

114

MeCN/water) exposed to CO2 (1 atm) in the dark also exhibited carbocation formation (Figure 1b,

115

orange trace), MGCF3OH, was less reactive with CO2 in the absence of light (Figure 1b, red trace).

116

Aiming to evaluate whether photodissociation would proceed with these derivatives, we subjected

117

MGBrOH and MGCF3OH (1 mM in 2:1 MeCN/water) to UV light (λexc = 265 nm). Unexpectedly,

118

instead of the photobasic behaviour characteristic of parent MGCB (MGHOH), both solutions

119

displayed a rapid decrease in pH, which appeared to slightly reverse upon removal of the light source

120

(Figure 1c, red and orange traces). The photoacidity appears to be oxygen-dependent, suggesting the

121

presence of a radical pathway that may generate hydrogen peroxide and/or organic hydroperoxides,

122

though these products remain to be fully characterized. Nonetheless, such complications indicated that

123

straightforward electronic tuning of MGCB derivatives was unlikely to realize reversible CO2 capture

124

and release.

136
137

As an alternative strategy to destabilize the trityl cation formed upon hydroxide dissociation

138

(Figure 2a), we were interested in the introduction of antiaromaticity by connecting two of the aromatic

139

rings into a fluorene substructure. Upon hydroxide dissociation, the fluorenyl cation core contains a 4π-

140

electron cyclopentadienyl substructure, which could favour ion recombination and hence lower the

141

pKaH´. This approach has several appealing secondary consequences. First, the enhanced conjugation

142

of the fluorene core, which effectively enforces two of the benzene rings to be coplanar,

143

bathochromically shifts the photobase absorption to enable the system to be driven by visible light,

144

rather than the ultraviolet wavelengths used to operate Malachite green derivatives. Furthermore, DFT

145

calculations in Figure 2b and the Supplementary Information show that, while the carbocation is indeed

146

disfavored in the ground state, on the excited-state surface, the evolution of Baird aromaticity provides

147

a strong thermodynamic driving force for hydroxide elimination.38 Hence, the fluorenes may be

148

expected to show better reversibility than their Malachite green analogues.

149

The parent fluorenyl photobase (PBHOH) was synthesized via Grignard reaction of 3,6-

150

bis(dimethylamino)fluorenone (Figure S1). We measured the pKaH´ to be 5.9 (SI Table 1), confirming

151

that the effective basicity is reduced relative to MCGB (pKaH´ = 6.8). Additional tuning of the basicity

152

was achieved by preparing derivatives substituted on the 9-aryl ring: PBCF3OH, PBClOH, PBMeOH,

153

and PBOMeOH. By titration, their pKaH´ values spanned 2.7 units (SI Table 1), with the -CF3 and -Cl

154

para-substituents destabilizing the carbocation and the -Me and -OMe para-substituents slightly

155

stabilizing the carbocation, but all being less basic than MGHOH.

156

An ideal photobase must be a sufficiently weak ground-state base to avoid CO2 capture in the

157

dark but photodissociate a large concentration of hydroxide for maximum CO2 capture. As shown in

158

Figure 2d, only PBOMeOH (pKaH´ = 6.7) showed significant light-independent carbocation formation

159

after CO2 exposure for 2 min, indicating that this candidate was too basic for reversible CO2 capture, as

160

would be expected from the similarity of its basicity to MGHOH. Next, we evaluated the light-activated

161

hydroxide release from each of the photobases by tracking pH of an MeCN/water solution under

162

photoirradiation. Figure 2e shows the solution pH of ca. 7 prior to irradiation jumping to pH 11.7 and

163

11.6 over the course of 4 min after exposure of PBOMeOH and PBMeOH solutions, respectively, to a

164

390 nm lamp. Upon removal of the light, the pH decayed to ca. 8.5 over roughly 25 min, indicating

165

quenching of over 99% of the photoeliminated hydroxide. Solutions of PBHOH, PBClOH and PBCF3OH

166

exhibited pH jumps to 11.4, 11.3, and 11.3, respectively, over 4 min of similar illumination. Subsequent

167

resting in the dark led to pH decays to 8.0 or lower over 25 min. It is notable that PBClOH and PBCF3OH

168

were unable to retain a steady pH under photoirradiation and some loss of hydroxide occurred before

169

the light source was removed. We concluded that electron-withdrawing groups clearly inhibited

hydroxide ion photodissociation, and, although the effect is not as pronounced as for the MGCB

171

derivatives, PBClOH and PBCF3OH were unsuitable candidates for reversible CO2 capture.

solution was irradiated with 390 nm light for 1 min under stirring. UV-vis absorption of PBMe+ was

addition (dotted line) to PBMeOH solution under sunlight. (e) CO2 levels detected in headspace (67 mL)
after release in the dark for 90 min. (f) Cycling of direct air capture. Air was bubbled through solution
for 6 min under photoirradiation and the headspace CO2 levels (7 mL) analyzed after 90 min relaxation.

184

Overall, the most promising compound for reversible CO2 capture was PBMeOH, as it showed

185

no CO2 capture in the dark and the largest pH increase under photoirradiation. The identification of this

186

candidate is consistent with the optimal pKaH´ for photobasic CO2 capture to be ca. 6. An additional

187

criterion for photobasic CO2 capture is that the photoswitch must be stable to many cycles between the

188

neutral and the basic ionized state. As reference, Figure 2c shows the absorption spectra of PBMeOH

189

and its conjugate acid PBMe+. Irradiating PBMeOH solution with 390 nm light resulted in a large increase

190

in carbocation absorption which gradually decayed over 90 min (Figure 3a). We repeated this entire

191

experiment 10 times over a 15 h period (Figure 3b) and found that the maximum absorbance decreased

192

by only ca. 1% per cycle and the minimum absorbance remained unchanged, signifying an acceptable

193

level of photostability.

194

We investigated the capacity of our system to capture CO2 by tracking the pH under

195

photoirradiation and subsequent CO2 exposure. As shown in Figure 3c, solutions of PBMeOH (10 mM

196

in 2:1 MeCN/H2O) were irradiated with a 390 nm lamp, leading to a pH jump from 7 to 11.6 over 5

197

min. Exposure to CO2 streams resulted in a pH decrease as the hydroxide ions were converted to

198

bicarbonate or carbonate, with the rate of capture and the terminal pH depending on the concentration

199

of the input stream. First, under bubbling 100% CO2, a near-instantaneous decline of the pH to 6.0 was

200

observed within 1 min, indicating nearly complete utilization of the theoretical capacity. If instead, CO2

201

from human exhalation (3.8% v/v) was used as the input stream, the pH decreased to 7.7 over 2 min

202

illustrating CO2 capture was still rapid and nearly complete (hydroxide concentration decreased by 4

203

orders of magnitude). Interestingly, simulated direct-air capture was successful, reaching a pH of 9.7

204

over a 20 min period, and continuing to decrease thereafter but very slowly. We monitored the fluorenyl

205

carbocation concentration during this process by UV-vis spectroscopy (SI Figure 16), finding a gradual

206

increase starting from the time at which air bubbling began. To our knowledge, this is the first

207

demonstration of effective direct air capture using photogenerated hydroxide. We can estimate by

208

charge balance that ca. 99% of hydroxide for capture was effectively utilized. Although a calibrated

209

lamp was used for the test experiments above, the system can also be driven by natural sunlight. After

210

exposing the photobase solution to direct sunlight (Figure 3d), a pH increase was observed after only

211

3 min, although to a slightly lower terminal value (10.8). Exposure to a 3.8% CO2/air stream again led

212

to pH decrease to 7.0 indicating effectively complete neutralization of all hydroxide ions by reaction

213

with CO2.

214

After capture from each of the three test concentrations (100%, 3.8%, 400 ppm), we rested the

215

system in the dark for 90 min under a static N2 headspace. As indicated also by the UV-vis absorption

216

profile, during this time, the fluorenyl cation was gradually and completely quenched, recovering the

217

carbinol. Thus, we considered it likely that that the captured CO2 was fully released during the process.

218

To confirm release, we measured the headspace CO2 concentrations (Figure 3e) with a portable CO2
9

219

meter and found a significant amount of CO2 in the headspace, with the exact concentration depending

220

on the dilution of the original inlet stream. In particular, we demonstrated the release 1400 ppm from

221

the sample from direct-air capture, representing a three-fold concentration relative to the input stream.

222

To test the cyclability of our direct capture system, we repeated the CO2 enrichment cycle 3 times

223

(Figure 3f), finding a similar effectiveness in each cycle as gauged by the amount of CO2 outgassed in

224

the dark.

225

Mechanism of CO2 capture and release by PBMeOH

226

The mechanism of hydroxide release from photoexcited PBMeOH was probed by ultrafast

227

transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Figure 4a shows the transient absorption spectrum of PBMeOH

228

after nanosecond laser excitation, using the reaction conditions of the steady-state photochemistry,

229

namely 0.1 mM PBMeOH was dissolved in 2:1 MeCN:H2O solution. At early time delays (Δt < 30 ns),

230

a positive TA spectrum is observed that resembles the steady-state PBMe+ absorption spectrum shown

231

in Figure 3a (trace at t = 0 min) with underlying absorption features in the 400–500 nm wavelength

232

region. These underlying absorption features disappear at later times (Δt > 300 ns) to furnish a TA

233

spectrum that matches the absorption spectrum of PBMe+. The presence of an additional species in the

234

400-500 nm region is supported by time-resolved decay measurements (Figure 4a, inset), which show

235

that an early time species decays with a 81 ns lifetime to leave the longer-lived PBMe+ species that

236

persists to the maximum delay time of our detection (τ > 20 ms). Normalization and subtraction of the

237

early (9 ns) and later (90 µs) transient spectra reveals the spectrum of the early time species that is

238

shown in Figure 4b.

400 nm. (b) ΔΔA spectrum obtained by taking the difference of normalized ΔA spectra at time delays
of 9 ns and 90 μs.

244

The identification of the early time species (Figure 4b) is unveiled by excited state electron

245

transfer experiments with PBMeCl, which may be photoreduced by one electron from the excited-state

246

of Ru(bpy)32+. Figure 5a shows the TA spectrum resulting from the excited state quenching of

247

Ru(bpy)32+ by PBMeCl. The Ru(bpy)32+ excited state (Figure 5a, burgundy trace) dominates the TA

248

spectrum upon laser excitation, with a pronounced absorption and bleach with maxima of 390 and 450

249

nm, respectively. The TA spectrum evolves to a new species at 2.7 µs with weak absorption features

250

centered at 425 and 550 nm, and bleach features at 450, 500 and 850 nm (Figure 5a, blue trace). The

251

overall TA signal at 2.7 µs primarily comprises an absorption due to PBMe• and a bleach due to the

252

depletion of PBMe+. As shown in Figure S15, photoexcited PBMeCl decays within 10 ps, thus only the

253

ground state depletion of PBMe+ contributes to the TA spectrum at 2.7 µs. Figure 5b shows the

254

difference spectrum (green trace) calculated from adding the early TA feature in Figure 4b (reproduced

255

as the gray trace, Figure 5b), the late time TA feature for PBMe+ from Figure 4a (inverted as a bleaching

256

signal as seen in Figure 5b, purple trace), and a small contribution of Ru(bpy)32+ excited state. As shown

257

in Figure 5c, the calculated difference spectrum reproduces the TA spectrum (time-averaged TA spectra

258

from 1.2 to 1.9 µs) of Ru(bpy)32+ excited state quenching by PBMe+, thus establishing the early time

259

absorption spectrum in Figure 4b to be that of PBMe•.

The presence of water is essential to furnishing long-lived PBMe+ and –OH ions, the latter of

267

which may be captured by CO2 to generate bicarbonate. The earliest time dynamics of PBMeOH in neat

268

MeCN are captured by the fsTA spectrum shown in Figure 6a. The absorption feature of PBMe+ in the

269

600–800 nm is immediately apparent, though it is broadened when compared to the spectra in Figure

270

4a. As opposed to the extremely long ms lifetime of PBMe+ in a MeCN/H2O solvent mixture (Figure

271

4a, inset), the PBMe+ transient at λmax = 750 nm in neat MeCN decays by its back reaction with –OH in

272

3.1 ns (Figure 6b). The later-time dynamics of PBMeOH in neat MeCN are shown in Figure 6c. With

273

the PBMe+ species completely back-reacted with –OH, a clean transient spectrum is observed for a

274

species that matches the ΔΔA spectrum of PBMe• shown in Figure 4b. The PBMe• radical back reacts

275

with •OH in 35 ns (Figure 6d). The decay time constant of 3.1 ns for PBMe+ in neat MeCN is consistent

276

with observed recombination rates of solvent-caged ion pairs in polar, organic solvents,39 thus

277

suggesting that –OH remains confined to a solvent-pair in the absence of H2O.

285

Taken together, the excited state dynamics of PBMeOH are consistent with a mechanistic

286

scheme for photochemical hydroxide release summarized in Figure 7. Photoexcited PBMeOH*

287

undergoes prompt bond homolysis to PBMe• and •OH and bond heterolysis to PBMe+ and –OH within

288

the envelope of laser excitation. The homolytic primary photoproducts recombine within 34 ns to return

289

the system to PBMeOH ground state. In the case of the primary heterolytic photoproducts, a solvent-

290

caged [PBMe+…OH–] ion pair is produced. In neat MeCN, the ion pair recombines in 3 ns. Conversely,

291

in the presence of H2O, cage escape of –OH is possible. Based on the PBMe+ species, persisting to τ >

292

20 ms, the long lifetime of the caged-escaped –OH ion enables it to be captured by CO2 to generate the

293

HCO3– that is observed in steady-state photolysis experiments. We note, that the cage escape yield is

294

reflected by the production of PBMe+ at long time scales (t > 1 µs), as indicated by the τ2 kinetics decay

295

trace shown in Figure 4a. Actinometric TA measurements were determined from the TA spectra at t =

296

2.25 µs to yield the photochemical quantum yield (QYPC) of PBMe+ formation (details provided in SI).

297

We measured a QYPC of 22.8 ± 0.4 %. This high quantum yield for OH– photogeneration, and thus CO2

298

capture, exceeds that afforded by photoacid approaches. For example, our previous investigation into

299

merocyanine photoacids showed that productive phototriggered release of H+ occurred with a quantum

300

yield of only 1.3%.

state of PBMeOH. In aqueous solution, the heterolytic pathway leads to CO2 capture when the OH– cage
escapes the photogenerated [PBMe+…OH–] ion pair.

305

In experiments performed under aerobic conditions, radical recombination of the homolysis

306

products appear to outcompete degradation pathways, such as solvent reaction, as the 380–550 nm

feature returns to ground state with no other significant photoproducts observed. However, with

308

rigorous exclusion of oxygen, nsTA experiments involving prolonged exposure to the excitation beam

309

in 1 cm quartz cuvette produced one or more additional photoproducts (Figure S18). As in the

310

photoreduction of PBMeCl, we observe what appears to be a PBMe+ bleach on top of another absorbing

311

transient species. Therefore it appears that an environment free of oxygen may increase the lifetime of

312

the PBMe• radical leading to activation of alternative photochemical pathways that compete with •OH

313

recombination. An unusual practical consequence is that this photochemical CO2 system not only

314

tolerates the presence of oxygen but may require it for stability, contrasting starkly with most known

315

electrochemical systems for which minimizing oxygen exposure is a critical consideration.

Figure 8. Potential mechanisms of CO2 release Mechanism 1, CO2 is released via carbonic acid.
Mechanism 2, CO2 is released via carbonic acid monoester. Second-order decay plot of carbocation
over time with and without CO2 10 mM MeCN-H2O solution of PBMeOH was stirred under 390 nm
light for 5 mins. Once the light source was removed, solution aliquots were diluted to 10 M and the
UV-Vis absorption spectrum recorded to detect carbocation decay at  ~ 950 nm over time. This was
then fit to a second order rate equation and the rate constant extrapolated from the gradient of the plot
shown above. This experiment was repeated but with exposure of the photobase solution to pure CO 2
under photoirradiation.

325

In contrast to the hydroxide release and CO2 capture process, the CO2 release portion of the

326

cycle is photon-independent. Thus, its mechanistic possibilities are relatively more straightforward to

327

analyze, and we proposed two possibilities. In mechanism 1, which is essentially the microscopic

328

reverse of capture, the photobase is regenerated by nucleophilic attack of hydroxide, which is formed

329

in minor equilibrium with bicarbonate, on the carbocation. The irreversible consumption of hydroxide

330

continuously drives bicarbonate conversion to hydroxide (and free CO2), until all the photobase has

331

been reconstituted and all the CO2 released. Alternatively, in mechanism 2, the carbocation is directly

332

attacked by its counteranion bicarbonate, producing an unstable carbonic acid monoester that rapidly

333

dissembles by deprotonation and C–O heterolysis into photobase and free CO2. If we assume the first

334

step of each mechanism is involved in the rate-determining span, the predicted rate laws are,

335

respectively:

336

Rate = kM1[PBMe+][–OH] (mechanism 1);

Rate = kM2[PBMe+][–OOCOH] (mechanism 2).

337

A simple means to differentiate these scenarios is to compare the kinetics of release of PB+ OH-

338

as a reference with that of PBMe+ HCO3–. The rate of mechanism 1, linear in hydroxide concentration,

339

should be several orders of magnitude slower with CO2 exposure than without, as the pH of the solution

340

decreases by several units. Using in situ UV-vis spectroscopy, we followed the decay of the carbocation

341

in a ca. 10 mM solution of PBMeOH , prepared by photolysis, with and without pre-exposure to CO2 (1

342

atm) (Figure 8 plot). Both time courses fit well to second-order rate equations with observed rate

343

constants of 7.01 mM–1 s–1 without CO2 and 1.36 mM–1 s–1 after CO2 exposure. The fact that the latter

344

profile fits a second-order apparent rate law is evidence against mechanism 1, as the hydroxide

345

concentration would not be directly proportional to the carbocation concentration with CO2 present.

346

Further, although the apparent rate is roughly 5 times lower after CO2 exposure, we would expect a

347

much greater decrease if the rate were directly proportional to hydroxide ion concentration. Therefore,

348

we believe mechanism 2 is operative, and the slightly diminished rate consistent with the attenuated

349

nucleophilicity of bicarbonate relative to hydroxide.

Figure 9. Thermodynamic diagram for reversible CO2 capture. The photobase PBMeOH, initially in the
ground state, is excited (yellow arrow) to its excited state PBMeOH* to produce the photoionized state
according to the dynamics shown in Figure 7. The liberated hydroxide can capture CO2. After the light
source is removed, recombination of the ion pair back to the photobase, an energetically favourable
process, drives the release of CO2. Dashed curves highly how the ground state potential energy must be
tuned to strike a thermodynamic balance for reversible CO2 capture. If the initial photobase is too high
in energy (blue), CO2 will be captured without photoirradiation. Conversely, if the photobase is too low
in energy (red), hydroxide photorelease will be less efficient, and the capacity to capture CO2 is reduced.

361

Our pKa tuning and CO2 capture/release investigations have shown a delicate thermodynamic

362

balance must be maintained to achieve light-driven capture and dark release (Figure 9). The photobase

363

should be neutral in the dark, and hydroxide dissociation unfavourable to inhibit CO2 capture without

364

light. After photoexcitation the potential energy of the system is driven out-of-equilibrium resulting in

365

favourable ionization to free hydroxide and a carbocation. The hydroxide ion can then sequester CO2

366

as bicarbonate. Upon removal of the external energy stimulus, cation-hydroxide recombination is

367

energetically favourable, and CO2 is therefore liberated. PBMeOH (pKaH´= 6.1) was found to perform

368

best among tested photobases, consistent with the hypothesis that the pKaH’ of the photobase should

369

approximately match the pKa of carbonic acid (6.4).

370

Conclusion

371

Our work establishes the first reversible system for CO2 capture using Arrhenius photobases.

372

The good performance of our new fluorenyl photobases shows that incorporation a 4-electron ring into

373

the carbocation can encourage excited-state hydroxide dissociation to create Baird aromaticity, yet also

17

374

favour subsequent recombination of the ground-state antiaromatic cation with hydroxide. Structure–

375

activity relationships illustrate that the effective basicity of the photobase must be precisely tuned for

376

efficient CO2 separations. With the optimal system, capture was demonstrated from ambient air,

377

followed by release into an enriched output stream. Ultrafast spectroscopic investigations show that

378

hydroxide ion release occurs on a sub-ps timescale with high quantum efficiency. These studies suggest

379

that photoreversible hydroxide emitters merit further investigation as tools for CO2 capture and in other

380

diverse applications suitably regulated by light-driven equilibria.
