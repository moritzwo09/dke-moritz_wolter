Abstract
Atmospheric molecular clusters, the onset of secondary aerosol formation, are a major part of the current uncertainty in modern climate models. Quantum chemical (QC)
methods are usually employed in a funneling approach to identify the lowest free energy
cluster structures. However, the funneling approach highly depends on the accuracy of
low-cost methods to ensure that important low-lying minima are not missed. Here we
present a reparameterized GFN1-xTB model based on the Clusteromics I–V datasets
for studying atmospheric molecular (AMC) clusters, denoted AMC-xTB. The AMCxTB model reduces the mean of electronic binding energy errors from 7–11.8 kcal/mol
to roughly 0 kcal/mol and the root mean square deviation from 7.6–12.3 kcal/mol to
0.81–1.45 kcal/mol. In addition, the minimum structures obtained with AMC-xTB
are closer to the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory compared to GFN1-xTB. We
employ the new parameterization in two new configurational sampling workflows that
include an additional meta-dynamics sampling step using CREST with the AMC-xTB
model. The first workflow, denoted the “independent workflow”, is a commonly used
funneling approach with an additional CREST step, and the second, the “improvement
workflow”, where the best configuration currently known in the literature is improved
with a CREST+AMC-xTB step. Testing the new workflow we find configurations
lower in free energy for all the literature clusters with the largest improvement being
up to 21 kcal/mol.
Lastly, employing the improvement workflow we massively screened 288 multi-acid–
multi-base clusters containing up to 8 different species. For these new multi-acid–multicluster systems we observe that the improvement workflow finds configurations lower
in free energy for 245 out of 288 (85.1%) cluster structures. Most of the improvements
are within 2 kcal/mol, but we see improvements up to 8.3 kcal/mol. Hence, we can
recommend this new workflow based on the AMC-xTB model for future studies on
atmospheric molecular clusters.

Introduction

Molecular clusters, formed through the aggregation of various atmospheric species, play
a central role in aerosol particle formation, cloud nucleation, and chemical reactions, thus
influencing climate, air quality, and environmental chemistry. 1 The key species in cluster formation are believed to be inorganic molecules such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, and amines,
enhanced by other species such as water, methanesulfonic acid, nitric acid, formic acid, and
highly oxygenated organic molecules. 2–4 Theoretical studies typically aim to elucidate the
thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular interactions governing cluster formation and its
evolution. The main challenge for studying atmospheric molecular clusters is their complex configurational spaces, which require advanced configurational sampling techniques and
computationally demanding quantum chemistry methods to evaluate the cluster properties
accurately. 2 Furthermore, atmospheric clustering is believed to be a multi-species process, 5
adding another dimension of chemical complexity.
Thoroughly exploring the configurational space of atmospheric molecular clusters using,
for instance, metadynamics simulations 6,7 or genetic algorithms 8–10 at a high level of theory is
extremely computationally demanding. Hence, usually, a funneling approach 2,4,11 is applied,
where the configurational space is initially explored at a low level of theory such as force-field
or semiempirical methods, and only a subset of low energy structures is selected, reoptimized,
and reexamined at a higher level of theory. This process is repeated with an increasing
level of theory until only a few structures remain for evaluation at the desired high level.
Schematically, the process can be given as:
1. Generate initial cluster configurations
ABCluster/OGOLEM/Basin hopping or similar
2. Semi-empirical calculations
Optimization at the PM6/PM7/GFN1-xTB/GFN2-xTB or similar level
3. DFT calculations

DFT optimization and vibrational frequency calculations
4. Single point energy refinement
Single-point energy calculation at coupled cluster level on the DFT optimized geometry
Between each step in the funneling approach, filtering can be applied to reduce the number
of structures that need to be handled. This can either be based on an energy threshold or a
set number of cluster structures. Eventually, we end up with a handful of structures at the
highest obtainable level.
The first step in the funneling procedure is the generation of a large number of configuration candidates. The key idea is sampling a large part of the potential energy surfaces at
a low level of theory to get estimates for the global free energy minimum. This is usually
carried out using force-field methods in combination with genetic algorithms such as in ABCluster 9,10,12–15 and OGOLEM, 8,16–19,19–21 by random/manual sampling or using dynamic
methods such as basin hopping. 22–26 The major issue at this step is that most force-field
methods are unable to describe bond-breaking, such as proton transfer reactions, which are
important for atmospherically relevant molecular clusters, requiring the sampling to include
monomers where the hydrogens have been transferred to get adequate sampling. Furthermore, the accuracy of force-field methods is also insufficient to determine a subsample of the
conformer candidates and all the candidates have to be taken to the higher level of theory.
The next step is semi-empirical calculations as these are a better description of the
chemistry and filtering can be applied. Of the common semiempirical methods, GFN1xTB, 27 GFN2-xTB, 28 PM6, 29 and PM7 30 are the most used in configurational sampling
procedures for atmospheric molecular clusters. 2–4 Of these methods, GFN1-xTB has shown to
have the highest correlation with electronic binding energies at a higher level of theories 31,32
and have been shown to have a higher correlation with DFT trajectories for molecular
dynamics than GFN2-xTB. 33 The reason GFN2-xTB performs worse than GFN1-xTB for
atmospheric molecular clusters (often involving sulfuric acid) is that there is a decrease in
the number of d -functions for sulfur in the basis set for the newer GFN2-xTB model.

The third step is the subsequent optimization and vibrational frequency calculation of
the structures with DFT. This is the main bottleneck in the sampling methodology as limited computational resources only allow a fixed number of DFT structures to be optimized.
Therefore some form of filtering is required, often based on structural properties or electronic
energies from the semiempirical calculations. To circumvent the inaccuracies of semiempirical methods an intermediate step can be included, involving single-point energy calculations
at the DFT level on as many structures as possible. Another option for an intermediate step
is the utilization of machine learning (ML) methods. One can calculate a subset of the structures at a desired DFT level and train an ML model to predict the energies of the remaining
structures. 33,34 However, to mimic accurate DFT energies, kernel-based ML methods become
computationally demanding 34–36 and neural-network will require an extensive set of training
data hyperparameter optimization. 37 Moreover, ML methods often fail when predicting on
structures different from the training set.
Overall, the funneling approach is never more efficient than its weakest link given by the
semiempirical step in 2, in which accuracy determines the number of structures that have
to be optimized/have single points calculated at the DFT level. In this paper, we focus on
reparameterizing the GFN1-xTB method based on DFT energies of atmospherically relevant molecular clusters yielding a GFN1-xTB model reparametrized based on ωB97X-D/631++G(d,p) for ‘atmospheric molecular clusters’ denoted AMC-xTB. This new parameterization is used to sample 288 large multi-acid–multi-base clusters containing AM equivalent
to the clusters studied by Knattrup et al. 38

Methodology

2.1

Computational Details

Single-point energies, gradients, and geometries for the reparameterization, configurational
sampling, and comparisons were calculated using the xtb 6.4.0 program using the GFN15

xTB 27 and AMC-xTB parameterizations. A modified version of ArbAlign 39 available in
the JKCS program 40 was used to calculate the root-mean-square differences (RMSD) between molecular structures. Gaussian 16, version B.01 41 was used for the DFT calculations.
CREST 2.12 6,7 with an energy window of 15 kcal/mol and in noncovalent interaction mode
and ABCluster 2.0 9,10 with a population of SN = 3000, number of generations of gmax = 200,
and gen. survival of glimit = 4 were used for additional configurational sampling.

2.2

Cluster Data Sets

For reparameterization of GFN1-xTB, we used the Clusteromics I–V data sets 42–46 containing (acid)0−2 (base)0−2 clusters of the following atmospherically relevant species: sulfuric
acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), nitric acid (NA), formic acid (FA), ammonia (AM),
methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA) and ethylenediamine
(EDA). All structures are optimized at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory and we
used the up to three lowest electronic energy configurations found per each cluster as the optimization set for GFN1-xTB reparametrization. This leads to an optimization set comprising
a total of 1073 clusters. The GFN1-xTB reparameterization based on this optimization set
will be denoted as the AMC-xTB model.
All new data calculated are freely available in the Atmospheric Cluster DataBase 47 along
with the new AMC-xTB parameter file (see Section 2).

2.3

Optimization Strategy

The GFN1-xTB model contains 15 global parameters, 2 element-pair-specific parameters,
and 32 element-specific parameters of relevance to the species present in the optimization
sets (H, C, N, O and S atoms). Initially, the Hessian was generated to probe the sensitivity of
the parameters, however, we found it computationally feasible to employ a similar optimization strategy to the original GFN1-xTB paper, 27 where we optimize all relevant parameters
simultaneously. We utilize a modified version of an in-house pseudo-Newton–Raphson op6

timizer by Jensen et al. 48 for the optimization of a target function (T ) containing a linear
combination of the difference in electronic binding energies (∆E b in kcal/mol and gradient
norms (g norm ) in Hartree/Bohr radius at the current GFN1-xTB parameterization and the
target ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory:

Here, Nconf is the total number of structures in the optimization set, Niatoms is the number
of atoms in the i’-th structure. We normalized by the number of atoms in each structure to
prevent “overfitting” to the larger clusters.
We chose the electronic binding energies as the target properties to get a better tool
for filtering based on energies in configurational sampling procedures. The gradients were
included directly in the target function. We use equilibrium structures at the given level of
theory, which are supposed to have near-zero gradients. However, the upper limit is set by
the accuracy threshold within the xtb program during the optimization, which makes the
gradients non-zero in the calculations.
Including only the electronic bindings energies in the target function yields a much better
fit for the energies but causes the gradients to “explode”, effectively rendering the optimization functionality of AMC-xTB useless for our target species. Giving higher weight to the
gradient norms in the target function makes the optimized structures more similar to the
target ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, however, we found that it causes problems
in the configurational sampling procedure where the decreased accuracy in determining the
binding energies causes our configurational sampling to yield high-energy conformers at the
DFT level. Overall, we found that including the gradient norms and difference in electronic
bindings energies in a 1:1 ratio is the best compromise between the two properties.

2.4

Updated Configurational Sampling Workflows

The strength of the new AMC-xTB model is that it can be used directly in configurational
sampling programs such as ABCluster and CREST. Here, we will test two different new
workflows for applying the reparameterized models in cluster configurational sampling.

2.4.1

Original Workflow

The workflow usually employed in studying atmospheric molecular clusters can be summarized as:
opt
ABCluster → GFN1-xTBopt
all → DFTN lowest

Here the number of configurations N that have to be optimized at the DFT level is a severe
bottleneck in the number of new cluster systems that can be studied. Usually, 50–100
configurations are optimized at the DFT level.

2.4.2

Independent Workflow

The independent workflow refers to configurational sampling from scratch using the wellestablished funneling approach using AMC-xTB instead of GFN1-xTB. 2,11 As the aim for
the approach is to be generally applicable, we also included an additional CREST step, as
it should be better at handling flexible organic compounds:

opt
ABCluster → AMC-xTBopt
all → CREST(AMC-xTB)lowest → DFT50 lowest

Here, ABCluster, a genetic algorithm for sampling clusters, is used for the initial sampling of
all possible neutral/ionic combinations of monomers that yield overall neutral clusters. The
xtb 6.4.0 program was then used to optimize all the configurations at the AMC-xTB level.
The cluster lowest in electronic energy was then taken as the input structure for CREST in
non-covalent interaction mode, again using our new AMC-xTB model. The initial ABCluster
sampling is needed because we found CREST to be quite sensitive to the input structure and,

therefore, needs a good guess for a starting structure. The 50 structures lowest in electronic
energy are then optimized at the DFT level.

2.4.3

Improvement Workflow

The improvement workflow refers to using the best structure currently known at the corresponding level of theory as the input structure for CREST using the AMC-xTB model.

Best Structure → CREST(AMC-xTB) → DFTopt
50 lowest

From here on, the workflow is the same as the independent workflow, where the 50 structures
lowest in electronic energy are optimized at the corresponding DFT level.

Results and Discussion

3.1

Extension of the Multi-Acid–Multi-Base Dataset

To gain a more complete test set we extended the multi-acid–multi-base clusters systems by
Knattrup et al. 38 using the same workflow for a total of 288 new AM-containing clusters.
With the acids being SA, MSA, FA and NA and the bases being AM, MA, DMA and TMA.
This is the first sampling of multi-component clusters containing up to 8 different species
yielding a data set where synergistic effects in cluster formation between different species
of bases 35 and acids 38 and mixes thereof can be studied. Such clusters could be relevant
for modeling polluted coastal environments. Figure 1 presents the molecular structure of a
newly sampled 8-component cluster. It is seen that all the acids have transferred a proton
to all the bases.

The initial sampling yields binding free energies ranging from −28.43 kcal/mol
[(MSA)1 (NA)1 (FA)1 (AM)2 ] to −104.0 kcal/mol [(SA)3 (NA)1 (AM)1 (MA)1 (DMA)2 ] for the
cluster configurations lowest in free energy at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory.

3.2

Assessment of the AMC-xTB Binding Energies

We reparameterized GFN1-xTB to obtain a new tight-binding semiempirical reparameterization denoted as AMC-xTB. Figure 2 shows the error in electronic binding energies before
(GFN1-xTB) and after (AMC-xTB) reparameterization. The models have been tested on
the entire Clusteromics I–V 42–46 data sets (56436 data points), the sulfuric acid–multi-base
(SA)1−4 (AM/MA/DMA/TMA/EDA)1−4 cluster data set (684 data points) by Kubečka et
al. 35 and the multi-acid–muti-base (SA/FA/MSA/NA)1−4 (MA/DMA/TMA)1−4 by Knattrup
et al. 38 including the new AM-containing clusters (1629 data points). All the tested structures are equilibrium structures at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. Although
the Gaussian version and integration grid used for optimization differ for some structures,
it was found to have a negligible effect on this comparison as we are studying the binding

set has sulfuric acid–multi-base (SA)1−4 (AM/MA/DMA/TMA/EDA)1−4 clusters, Knattrup
et al. 38 set has the multi-acid–muti-base (SA/FA/MSA/NA)1−4 (MA/DMA/TMA)1−4 clusters including the new AM-containing clusters sampled in this work.

For all the data sets shown in Figure 2 the reparameterization results in near-zero means of
the energy errors. This is a reduction from error means of 3.7–11.8 kcal/mol for GFN1-xTB.
In addition, the AMC-xTB model achieves a more narrow error distribution with the root
mean square deviations decreasing from 7.6–12.3 kcal/mol to 0.81–1.45 kcal/mol, implying
that there will be fewer outliers. The error span on the larger clusters for the Knattrup
et al. 38 and Kubečka et al. 35 sets are similar to the error span for the smaller clusters
in the optimization set. This shows that reparameterizing on smaller clusters is adequate
for calculations on larger-sized clusters as the model gets some of the underlying chemistry
correct and scales effectively with system size. The new AMC-xTB model reduces the number
of structures needed to pass from the semiempirical step to the DFT step in configurational
sampling. For atmospheric molecular clusters, this implies that the AMC-xTB model is

3.3

Assessment of the AMC-xTB Geometries and Gradients

The gradient norms were also a part of the optimization scheme (Equation 1). Figure 3
shows the gradient norms given by the xtb program for the two parameterizations. The
structures are equilibrium structures at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, so
the ideal gradient norms should be below the default gradient convergence thresholds of
10−3 Eh/α. None of the methods manages to be below this threshold, but the AMC-xTB
model is close. This does not directly mean the model is closer to the correct structure, as the
new parameters might just have flattened the potential energy surface at this point without
moving closer to the minimum. However, including the gradients in the target function avoids

numerical instability, and yields reasonable optimized structures. To test if the structures
are closer to a minimum at the DFT level, the initial DFT structures of all three datasets
were optimized using the different parameterizations, and the RMSD was computed between
the initial DFT structure and the GFN1-xTB/AMC-xTB optimized structures (see Table 1).

We find that the AMC-xTB model reduces the mean RMSD of the full Clusteromics set
from 0.484 Å to 0.355 Å and a similar reduction is seen for the Knattrup et al. 38 and Kubečka
et al. 35 sets with RMSDs being reduced from 0.378 Å to 0.235 Å and from 0.376 Å to 0.189 Å,
respectively. This, coupled with the smaller gradients, suggests that the reparameterized
model is closer to a minimum at the DFT level. This implies that the preoptimization step
in a funneling approach with the AMC-xTB model compared to GFN1-xTB yields structures
closer to the DFT structure and will likely reduce the subsequent optimization time at the
DFT level.

Test of New Configurational Sampling Workflows

To further test how the new AMC-xTB model fares in cluster configurational sampling, we
tested the independent and improvement workflow for several previously studied (acid)4 (base)4
cluster systems. Hence, the workflow is tested on clusters up to twice the size of those used

to be well-sampled using the original configurational sampling procedure and thereby difficult to improve. Still, the new CREST+AMC-xTB methodology manages to find cluster
structures lower in free energy by 0.21 kcal/mol compared to the previous works.
In the case of the (SA)4 (AM)4 and (SA)1 (MSA)1 (NA)1 (FA)1 (AM)1 (MA)1 (DMA)1 (TMA)1
clusters, the independent/improvement workflows perform similar and yield similar free energy improvements. However, for the (SA)4 (AM)1 (MA)1 (DMA)1 (TMA)1 clusters, the independent workflow works slightly better, finding a cluster 0.85 kcal/mol lower in free energy
compared to the improvement workflow. This illustrates that the sampling is very sensitive
to the configuration used as input for CREST, although it might also be due to the randomness of the dynamic processes in CREST. The reason for the difference might be that the
original work’s configurational sampling was worse than the independent workflow, yielding
a worse starting structure for the CREST sampling within the improvement workflow. We
see a massive improvement in the configurational sampling of the (SA)4 (EDA)4 clusters by
−18/−21 kcal/mol. This is caused by the flexibility of the EDA molecule, which makes it
difficult to sample the full configurational space using only ABCluster with rigid molecules.
This improvement should primarily be attributed to the inclusion of metadynamics sampling
in CREST and not purely the parameterization of AMC-xTB as it allows the EDA to rotate
around its bond and find a structure with more/better paired intermolecular interactions
as seen in Figure 5. It should also be noted that the main improvements are the electronic
binding energy and the thermal contribution varies very little between the clusters.

before and after the improvement workflow. Yellow = sulfur, red = oxygen, cyan = nitrogen,
brown = carbon, and white = hydrogen.
However, this shows the strength of the presented workflows as they can be used for
clusters containing more flexible organic molecules.

Massive Improvement Test

Based on the previous sections, it is clear that the improvement workflow could locate more
stable clusters. As the potential energy surface of multi-acid–multi-base clusters becomes
very complicated, here we test this new approach for such systems. These 288 new AMcontaining clusters were used as a massive test set for the improvement workflow using
the newly parameterized AMC-xTB model. The improvement workflow manages to find
configurations lower in free energy at the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) for 245 out of the 288
clusters (85.1 %) as can be seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Comparison of the lowest free energy conformer found by the improvement configurational workflow compared to the original workflow. Gibbs free energies are calculated at
the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory with the quasi-harmonic approximation (cutoff
of 100 cm−1 ).
In most cases, the improvement is between 0–2 kcal/mol. However, for the
(SA)1 (MSA)1 (NA)1 (FA)1 (AM)1 (DMA)2 (TMA)1 , (SA)3 (NA)1 (AM)1 (MA)3 , and
(SA)3 (FA)1 (AM)1 (MA)1 (DMA)2 clusters a massive improvement of 8.3, 5.2 and 3.9 kcal/mol
is observed, respectively.
Comparing the conformer index at the AMC-xTB level of theory with the final ωB97XD/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory with the quasi-harmonic approximation (cutoff of 100 cm−1 )
the Gibbs free energy minimum at the DFT level is also the electronic energy minimum at
the AMC-xTB level of theory for 66 of the clusters (See Figure 1). If 10 conformers are
included from the AMC-xTB level of theory, the free energy minimum energy is captured
for 155 out of the 288 clusters with improvements found for 209 (Se Figure 1). Furthermore,
the maximum error is 2 kcal/mol with a mean of 0.12 kcal/mol when reducing from 50 to
10 conformers.
This highlights the need for including dynamics-based sampling procedures for atmospheric clusters even though the system might seem fairly rigid.

It can also be envi-

sioned that the improvement workflow will be quite important when studying much larger
(SA)1−20 (base)1−20 clusters as recently done by Engsvang et al. 36,55 and Wu et al. 32 For large
clusters, the global minimum is tricky to locate, and adding dynamics-based configurational
sampling might aid in the process.

Conclusions

We have reparameterized the GFN1-xTB model to yield better binding electronic energies
and gradient norms for atmospherically relevant clusters composed of the following species:
sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), nitric acid (NA), formic acid (FA), ammo-

nia (AM), methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), triethylamine (TMA), and ethylenediamine (EDA). The reparameterization, denoted AMC-xTB, for use in the xtb/CREST
program, is based on the ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory. The model shows a substantial decrease in the error of the binding electronic energies compared to the original
GFN1-xTB parameterization and the gradient norms of the equilibrium structures are closer
ωB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory compared to GFN1-xTB. The reparameterization
strategy is general and can be used to reparameterize other methods such as GFN2-xTB.
We tested two new configurational sampling procedures with the new parameterizations
being employed in the xtb and CREST programs. The first workflow, denoted as “improvement workflow,” is based on improving the best structure currently known in the literature
with CREST and then doing the DFT calculations. The second workflow, denoted the
“independent workflow,” starts by configurational sampling using ABCluster, followed by
xtb, CREST, and then DFT. Using the two workflows, we find cluster structures lower in
free energy for the following (SA)4 (EDA)4 , (SA)4 (AM)4 ,(SA)4 (AM)1 (MA)1 (DMA)1 (TMA)1 ,
(SA)1 (MSA)1 (NA)1 (FA)1 (AM)4 and (SA)1 (MSA)1 (NA)1 (FA)1 (AM)1 (MA)1 (DMA)1 (TMA)1
systems in all cases compared to the best-known value in the literature.
Testing the improvement workflow on 288 large multi-acid–multi-base cluster systems,
the workflow finds improvements for 85.1 % of the clusters, showing the need for dynamicsbased sampling.
