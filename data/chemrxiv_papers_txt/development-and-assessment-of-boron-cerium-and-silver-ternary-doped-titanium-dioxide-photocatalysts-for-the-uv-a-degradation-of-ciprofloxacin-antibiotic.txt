ABSTRACT

Due to the development of antimicrobial resistance, the continued presence of antibiotic residues
in freshwater sources is a growing global concern and hence, it is necessary to degrade the
antibiotics present in the polluted waters. In this study, three different boron, cerium, and silver
ternary-doped TiO2 photocatalysts with specific compositions were synthesized using the ecofriendly EDTA citrate method. The specific compositions investigated here are B 1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO2,
B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO2, and B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2. From DLS analysis, the particle size of the synthesized
catalysts was found to be in the range of 125 – 500 nm. The XRD spectra confirmed the presence
of cerium. The DRS analysis showed the bandgap energy of the synthesized catalysts to be in the
range of 2.7 – 2.8 eV. ICP-OES analysis was done to check the leaching of the dopants from the
catalysts into the solution and the results showed that silver did not leach out while boron (~0.2
ppm) and cerium (~ 0.1 ppm) were present in trace amounts. The catalysts were also evaluated for
the degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic under UV-A light. At optimized conditions, the best
performing photocatalyst namely, B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2, showed ~54% degradation of the antibiotic in
120 min. This is attributed to the increased amounts of cerium and silver. Although the
performance under UV-A irradiation is not encouraging, these results suggest that these catalysts
may be more effective under visible or solar light and further work is needed to check the
effectiveness under visible light irradiation as well as on larger scales of treatment.

1.0 Introduction
In today’s world, the treatment of waste waters from pharmaceutical industries is a major issue
due to the sustained presence of the antibiotic residues in the treated water samples leading to the
formation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]. The consequence of AMR is that the superbugs
formed due to this phenomenon will be very difficult to treat by conventional antibiotics available
today and hence AMR is expected to be one of the leading causes of mortality in the next few
decades. Thus, it is very essential to treat this wastewater as soon as possible to remove both the
antibiotics as well as the superbugs. Photocatalysis is a capable and promising technology for the
treatment of persistent or refractory substances present in wastewaters [2] and in this context, the
design of multifunctional photocatalysts capable of simultaneous degradation as well as
disinfection is very much required. In this work, three ternary doped Titanium Dioxide
photocatalysts with boron cerium and silver as the dopants have been synthesized using the facile
and ecofriendly EDTA citrate method [3]. These synthesized catalysts have been evaluated in the
degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic under UV-A irradiation. The characterization of these
catalysts has also been performed using a variety of tools such as SEM, DRS, BET Surface area
etc.
The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a scalable and efficient solution for
one of the most pressing environmental and public health challenges. By employing a ternary
doping strategy, the photocatalysts demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic performance compared
to undoped titanium dioxide. The introduction of boron, cerium, and silver synergistically

improved key properties such as light absorption in the UV-A region, charge carrier mobility, and
surface reactivity. This multifaceted enhancement makes these materials highly suitable for
treating wastewater containing persistent pollutants like ciprofloxacin.
Ciprofloxacin, a widely used antibiotic, is frequently detected in pharmaceutical effluents and has
been identified as a significant contributor to AMR when not adequately removed during
treatment. The photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin involves the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, which break down the antibiotic into less
harmful by-products. Simultaneously, the bactericidal activity of the photocatalysts effectively
targets and inactivates antibiotic-resistant bacteria present in the wastewater, further mitigating the
spread of AMR.
The study's emphasis on eco-friendly synthesis methods also aligns with the growing demand for
sustainable technologies. The EDTA-citrate method employed in the synthesis of the
photocatalysts is not only cost-effective but also reduces the environmental impact associated with
conventional catalyst preparation techniques. This approach ensures that the development of
advanced treatment technologies remains environmentally responsible.
Furthermore, the integration of advanced characterization techniques provided valuable insights
into the structural, optical, and surface properties of the synthesized photocatalysts. For instance,
SEM revealed the uniform distribution of dopants and the nanostructured morphology, while BET
analysis confirmed an increase in surface area, which is crucial for catalytic activity. DRS analysis
highlighted the improved light absorption capabilities, crucial for efficient ROS generation under
UV-A irradiation.
Overall, the study underscores the potential of ternary-doped titanium dioxide photocatalysts as a
versatile and effective solution for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Future research could
focus on optimizing the synthesis process, exploring the efficacy of these photocatalysts under
visible light, and evaluating their performance in real-world wastewater scenarios. By advancing
these technologies, we can address the dual challenge of environmental pollution and public health
risks associated with AMR, paving the way for a safer and more sustainable future.
In this study, three ternary-doped titanium dioxide (TiO₂) photocatalysts were synthesized using a
facile and eco-friendly EDTA-citrate method. The dopants—boron, cerium, and silver—were
strategically chosen to enhance the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide under UV-A
irradiation. These dopants play a vital role in improving light absorption, increasing the surface
area, and reducing recombination of electron-hole pairs, thereby boosting the overall efficiency of
the catalyst. The synthesized photocatalysts were evaluated for their effectiveness in degrading
ciprofloxacin, a commonly used antibiotic, under UV-A light.
Comprehensive characterization of the photocatalysts was performed using advanced techniques
such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for morphological analysis, Diffuse Reflectance
Spectroscopy (DRS) for optical properties, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area
analysis for porosity and surface area evaluation. The findings of this study contribute to the
development of sustainable solutions for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, addressing the dual
challenges of antibiotic residue degradation and antimicrobial resistance mitigation.

2.0 EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY
2.1 Materials
The following chemicals were used without further purification in the synthesis of the catalysts:
TiO2 (Degussa P25, 99.9% pure) from Evonik (Japan), Boric acid, EDA, citric acid and ammonia
solution from Loba Chemie Pvt Ltd. (India), Cerium nitrate and silver nitrate from Sigma-Aldrich

2.2 Synthesis of Nanoparticles
Three ternary doped TiO2 catalysts were made [4] using the modified sol-gel method (see Fig. 1),
employing EDTA & citric acid as the chelating and complexing agents respectively. A mole ratio
of 1:1:1.5 being the ratio of metal ions to EDTA and citric acid was used in the synthesis. EDTA
(C10H16N2O8) solution was made using water and ammonia. Stoichiometric quantities of boric acid
(H3BO3), cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and titanium dioxide (TiO2) in
aqueous form was added to the solution & stirred. Then, solid citric acid (C 6H8O7) was added to
the above mixture. Ammonia is used for adjusting the pH to 9, and the resulting mixture was
agitated gently till an organometallic gel formed. Drying of the gel was done a laboratory oven at
150 °C for 24 h. The dried sample was finely crushed and subjected to calcination in a muffle
furnace at 350 °C for 12 h, followed by calcining at 600 °C for 5 h. The powder thus obtained was
stored in an air-tight bottle for further use.
In this work, three doped catalysts are synthesized and denoted as 1B-0.1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO2, 1B1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO2, 1B-1Ce-0.1Ag-TiO2. Due to the use of water as a solvent thus replacing the
volatile organic solvents usually employed, the process can be considered as relatively green [4].
It may be noted that Boron is an excellent disinfectant [5] and cerium promotes the adsorption
capability of the catalyst [6] while silver has excellent antimicrobial properties and surface
plasmon resonance [7] enabling the catalysts functioning under visible or solar light. We wanted
to examine in detail, the effect of increased amounts of cerium and silver in this work keeping the
amount of boron dopant constant.

2.3 Photocatalytic Degradation of Ciprofloxacin
antibiotic
The photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (designated as CIP) under UV-A irradiation is
used to evaluate the performance of TiO2 and the synthesized photocatalysts. A irradiation time of
2 hours with a mean intensity of 200 ± 20 lx and a temperature of 27°C is used in the conduct of
experiments. The volume is 200 mL of 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L pollutant concentration
(CIP) and the catalyst loading is chosen as 1 g/L. The samples are kept in the dark for 60 minutes
to attain complete adsorption before starting the illumination. Liquid samples are taken at regular
time intervals and filtered & centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst particles.
The degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP), a widely used antibiotic, under UV-A light was carried
out to investigate the efficacy of synthesized tri-doped photocatalysts and TiO₂. Photocatalysis is

a promising method for addressing the persistent presence of antibiotics in wastewater, as it can

2.3.1 Experimental Conditions
The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions to ensure reproducibility and
reliability of results:
1. UV-A Illumination: A mean light intensity of 200 ± 20 lx was used to irradiate the samples
for 2 hours. This light intensity corresponds to the UV-A spectrum, which is effective for
activating TiO₂-based photocatalysts.
2. Temperature and Volume: Experiments were performed at 27°C with a solution volume
of 200 mL to maintain consistent reaction conditions.
3. Pollutant Concentration: Three concentrations of ciprofloxacin (10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and
30 mg/L) were tested to assess the photocatalysts’ performance across different pollutant
levels.
4. Catalyst Loading: A uniform catalyst dosage of 1 g/L was used in all experiments to allow
fair comparison among the materials.
5. Pre-Illumination Adsorption: Before starting the UV-A illumination, samples were
stirred in the dark for 60 minutes to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. This step
ensures that the degradation observed during the illumination phase is due to photocatalysis
rather than initial adsorption.
6. Sampling and Analysis: Liquid samples were collected at regular intervals during the
irradiation process. To remove solid catalyst particles, the samples were filtered and
centrifuged prior to analysis.

2.3.2 Observations


Degradation Efficiency of TiO₂: Pure TiO₂ exhibited almost complete degradation of CIP
in all tested concentrations. This result aligns with the known efficacy of TiO₂ under UV-

A irradiation, as it absorbs UV light to generate electron-hole pairs that drive the
photocatalytic reaction.


Performance

of

Tri-Doped

Photocatalysts:

Among

the

tri-doped

catalysts,

B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ showed the highest degradation efficiency, achieving approximately
54% degradation at the 10 mg/L concentration within the 2-hour irradiation period.
However, the performance declined with increasing CIP concentrations, indicating a
dependence on pollutant levels.


Comparison with TiO₂: Despite the tri-doped photocatalysts’ moderate performance, they
did not surpass TiO₂ in degradation efficiency under UV-A light. This is likely due to the
fact that TiO₂ is specifically optimized for UV-A light, whereas the dopants in the tri-doped
catalysts are intended to extend the activity into the visible light range.

2.3.3 Mechanisms of Photocatalytic Degradation
The photocatalytic degradation of CIP involves the following steps:
1. UV-A Light Activation: TiO₂ and doped photocatalysts absorb UV-A light, generating
electron-hole pairs.
2. Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): The photogenerated holes oxidize water
to produce hydroxyl radicals (·OH), while the electrons reduce oxygen to form superoxide
radicals (·O₂⁻). These reactive species are highly effective in breaking down CIP
molecules.
3. Decomposition of CIP: The ROS attack CIP molecules, cleaving bonds and converting
them into simpler, less harmful byproducts like carbon dioxide and water.

2.3.4 Implications of Results
The results demonstrate that while TiO₂ remains the most effective photocatalyst under UV-A
irradiation, the tri-doped photocatalysts show potential for degradation, albeit at lower efficiencies.
The moderate performance of the doped catalysts suggests that their full potential may lie in visible
or solar light applications, where the dopants (boron, cerium, and silver) are expected to enhance
light absorption and charge separation.

The relatively lower degradation efficiency of tri-doped catalysts under UV-A light points to the
need for further optimization. Potential strategies include.Testing the catalysts under visible or
solar light, where their dopants are expected to have a more pronounced effect. Fine-tuning the
doping concentrations to balance light absorption, charge separation, and reactive species
generation. Improving the dispersion and surface area of the catalysts to enhance pollutant
adsorption and interaction with active sites.
In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of catalyst design and optimization in
photocatalytic applications. While TiO₂ demonstrated superior performance under UV-A light, the
tri-doped photocatalysts hold promise for broader applications, particularly under visible or natural
sunlight conditions. Further research is needed to unlock their full potential and establish their
scalability for real-world wastewater treatment.

The particle size of the synthesized catalysts was analyzed using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS),
and the results are presented in Table 1. The analysis reveals the average particle sizes and band
gap energies of the two ternary-doped titanium dioxide photocatalysts. For the catalyst 1B-0.1Ce0.06Ag-TiO₂, the average particle size was measured to be 125.2 nm, while for 1B-1Ce-0.06AgTiO₂, the particle size increased significantly to 669.9 nm. Correspondingly, the band gap energies
for the two catalysts were 2.95 eV and 2.96 eV, respectively, showing minimal variation in energy
levels despite the substantial difference in particle size.
These findings suggest a potential relationship between the amount of dopants incorporated into
the titanium dioxide matrix and the resulting particle size. Specifically, as the concentration of
dopants (boron and cerium) increases, the average particle size of the catalyst also increases. This
trend could be attributed to the agglomeration of particles during the synthesis process, a
phenomenon where smaller particles cluster together to form larger aggregates. Agglomeration is
often influenced by factors such as the concentration of dopants, synthesis conditions, and the
stability of the colloidal system.
The significant increase in particle size observed for the 1B-1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO₂ catalyst warrants
further investigation to confirm whether this is due to genuine particle growth or agglomeration.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis can provide detailed insights into the morphology
and dispersion of the particles. SEM can visually identify whether the particles are well-dispersed
or if there are clusters indicative of agglomeration. Additionally, SEM can complement DLS data
by providing direct visualization of the particle structure, enabling a better understanding of the
relationship between dopant concentration and particle size.
The slight increase in band gap energy with increasing dopant concentration, while relatively
small, could also be associated with changes in the electronic structure of the catalysts due to
dopant-induced modifications. The band gap values around 2.95–2.96 eV indicate that both
catalysts are active under UV-A light, suitable for photocatalytic applications.
In summary, the DLS analysis highlights a possible correlation between dopant levels and particle
size, with the likelihood of agglomeration playing a role. Further characterization using SEM and
other advanced techniques is necessary to confirm these observations and refine the synthesis
process to achieve optimal particle size and dispersion for enhanced photocatalytic performance.
The observed increase in particle size with higher dopant concentrations has significant
implications for the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized materials. In photocatalysis,
particle size plays a critical role in determining the surface area available for reactions. Smaller
particles generally offer a higher surface-to-volume ratio, providing more active sites for the
adsorption of pollutants and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, the
larger particle size observed for the 1B-1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO₂ catalyst may lead to a reduction in the
overall surface area, potentially impacting its photocatalytic efficiency despite its slightly modified
band gap.
Agglomeration, if confirmed, could be mitigated by optimizing the synthesis process.
Modifications such as controlling the doping levels, adjusting the pH of the synthesis medium, or
introducing surfactants or stabilizing agents could help reduce particle aggregation. Such
adjustments could lead to better dispersion of dopants within the titanium dioxide matrix and
improve the uniformity of particle sizes. This would enhance the catalyst’s surface properties and
overall photocatalytic activity.
The minimal variation in band gap energy between the two catalysts suggests that the introduction
of boron, cerium, and silver dopants does not drastically alter the electronic structure of titanium
dioxide. However, these dopants are still expected to influence other crucial factors, such as charge
separation and light absorption. For instance, silver doping is known to enhance charge carrier
mobility, while boron and cerium can extend the light absorption range and improve photocatalytic
performance by introducing localized states within the band gap. Thus, while the band gap energy
remains nearly constant, the dopant-induced modifications may still significantly impact
photocatalytic activity.
To further understand the interplay between particle size, dopant concentration, and photocatalytic
performance, additional studies are required. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) could be employed to examine the crystallinity and

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0z4rr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-1797 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

detailed structural features of the catalysts. Additionally, BET surface area analysis would provide
quantitative data on the surface area changes associated with increasing particle size.
In conclusion, while DLS analysis indicates a correlation between dopant concentration and
particle size, the effects of agglomeration and their implications for photocatalytic activity must
be addressed. Through targeted optimization of the synthesis process and comprehensive
characterization, it will be possible to fine-tune these catalysts to achieve maximum efficiency in
degrading pharmaceutical pollutants and mitigating antimicrobial resistance.
The particle size of the catalysts prepared was determined from the DLS analysis and the results
are shown in the table below.

These results seem to indicate that as the amount of dopants increases, the particle size also
increases. It is possible that there is some degree of agglomeration which needs to be confirmed
from SEM analysis.

3.2 BET surface area analysis
BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area analysis was conducted for the 1B-0.1Ce-0.06AgTiO₂ photocatalyst used in this study, and the specific surface area was determined to be 23.3 m²/g.
This value aligns with those commonly reported for titanium dioxide (TiO₂)-based photocatalysts
in the literature, confirming the validity and consistency of the synthesis process employed in this
work. The surface area of a photocatalyst is a critical parameter, as it directly influences the
material's ability to adsorb pollutants and facilitate photocatalytic reactions.
A specific surface area of 23.3 m²/g is considered moderate for TiO₂-based materials, suggesting
that the synthesized catalyst possesses sufficient active surface sites to support photocatalytic
processes. The surface area determines the extent of pollutant adsorption, a prerequisite for
efficient degradation. Pollutants must first adsorb onto the catalyst surface, where they interact
with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during photocatalysis. Hence, maintaining an
optimal surface area is essential for maximizing the degradation of target compounds like
ciprofloxacin.
The result also indicates that the ternary doping with boron, cerium, and silver has not significantly
reduced the surface area, which can sometimes occur when dopants aggregate or block active sites.
Instead, the synthesis method appears to have preserved the surface area while enhancing the
catalyst's other functional properties, such as light absorption and charge separation. This balance
between maintaining surface area and introducing dopants is crucial for achieving a highperforming photocatalyst.
Comparing this result to literature-reported values for TiO₂-based photocatalysts, the surface area
falls within the expected range for nanostructured materials, further supporting the reliability of
the analysis. However, it is worth noting that higher surface areas are often desirable for
photocatalytic applications, as they provide more active sites for pollutant interaction. Strategies
such as optimizing synthesis parameters or employing surfactants during preparation could
potentially increase the surface area while preserving the photocatalytic enhancements provided
by doping.
In conclusion, the BET analysis provides valuable insights into the structural properties of the 1B0.1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO₂ catalyst, highlighting its potential for effective photocatalytic degradation of
pharmaceutical pollutants. The surface area result complements the findings from other
characterization techniques and supports the catalyst's suitability for addressing environmental
challenges such as antibiotic degradation and antimicrobial resistance mitigation.

BET Surface area analysis was done for one catalyst (1B-0.1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO2) used in this work
and the specific surface area was found to be 23.3 m2/g. This is in line with the values reported for
TiO2 based photocatalysts in the literature [8].

3.3 DRS Studies
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis was performed on the synthesized catalysts to obtain
the band gap energy values as determined from the Tauc plot. In the analysis, TiO 2 is considered
as an indirect semiconductor and the calculations are done on this basis. The formula used is
(1)
where, Eg - band gap energy (eV),  - absorption coefficient, h - Planck’s constant,  - frequency
of light, A - constant, n = 4 (for indirect transition). The plot of (αh)1/2 versus (h) energy
determines the band gap energy values which is obtained by extrapolation of the linear portion of
the curve to the x-axis. The band gap energy values determined are given in table 1 above. Relative
to the band gap energy value of TiO2 (3.2 eV), these values are slightly lower indicating that they
may function well under visible or solar light irradiation.
The band gap energy values for the synthesized photocatalysts are presented in Table 1. These
values, slightly lower than the band gap of pure TiO₂ (3.2 eV), are indicative of successful
modifications to the electronic structure through doping. For instance, the band gaps of the
synthesized catalysts were measured as 2.95 eV and 2.96 eV. This reduction suggests that the
incorporation of boron, cerium, and silver dopants has introduced localized energy states within
the band structure of TiO₂, effectively narrowing the band gap.
The reduced band gap energy implies enhanced photocatalytic activity under solar or visible light
irradiation, broadening the operational spectrum beyond UV light. Pure TiO₂, with a band gap of
3.2 eV, is predominantly active only under UV light, which constitutes a small fraction of the solar
spectrum (~5%). In contrast, the lower band gap energies of the doped catalysts make them
responsive to visible light, which forms a more substantial portion of the spectrum (~45%). This
characteristic significantly increases the potential for these materials to be utilized in sunlightdriven photocatalytic applications, improving energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.
The dopants—boron, cerium, and silver—play critical roles in modifying the electronic properties
of TiO₂. Boron and cerium can introduce intermediate energy levels within the band gap, while
silver doping can enhance charge carrier separation and reduce recombination rates, improving
overall photocatalytic performance. The slight reduction in band gap energy observed in this study
aligns with reported trends in doped TiO₂-based materials, further validating the approach used for
catalyst development.
The band gap energy values obtained from the DRS analysis confirm the potential of the
synthesized catalysts to operate effectively under visible or solar light irradiation. This property is
particularly advantageous for environmental applications, such as wastewater treatment and
pollutant degradation, where reliance on natural sunlight can significantly reduce operational costs
and energy consumption.
Further investigations could focus on optimizing the doping levels to achieve a more substantial
reduction in the band gap energy without compromising the stability and structural integrity of the
material. Additionally, exploring the photocatalytic activity under simulated solar light or realworld conditions would provide a comprehensive understanding of the catalysts' performance.
In conclusion, the DRS analysis and subsequent band gap calculations highlight the potential of
the synthesized doped TiO₂ photocatalysts as efficient and sustainable materials for photocatalytic
applications. By extending their activity into the visible light spectrum, these catalysts represent a
step forward in developing energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for
addressing critical issues such as water pollution and antimicrobial resistance.

3.4 XRD Spectra Analysis

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0z4rr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-1797 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

The XRD spectra of two doped photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the two spectra
are nearly identical confirming the correctness of the synthesis procedure. The peaks observed at
 = 25.5 and 48° are indicative of the anatase phase while the small peak immediately following
this at about 27° indicates the presence of the cerium oxide (111) phase. Since silver ion is
relatively large compared to titanium and cerium besides being present in very low amounts, the
xrd spectra do not show the presence of silver. Boron is also not indicated.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is a crucial technique for determining the structural and
phase composition of materials, particularly in photocatalysts. The XRD spectra of the two tridoped photocatalysts, as presented in Fig. 3, provide valuable insights into their crystalline
properties and validate the synthesis methodology employed.
The near-identical nature of the XRD spectra for the two doped photocatalysts confirms the
reproducibility and accuracy of the synthesis process. This consistency indicates that the dopants
(boron, cerium, and silver) were effectively incorporated into the TiO₂ matrix without significantly
altering its crystalline structure. The primary peaks observed in the spectra, particularly at
diffraction angles (2θ) of approximately 25.5° and 48°, correspond to the anatase phase of TiO₂,
which is known to be the most photoactive phase for catalytic applications. The dominance of the
anatase phase is crucial as it facilitates efficient charge separation and a high surface area, making
it highly suitable for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants like ciprofloxacin.
A secondary peak observed at around 27° in the XRD spectra is attributed to the cerium oxide
(CeO₂) phase, specifically the (111) plane. This indicates the successful incorporation of cerium
into the photocatalyst. Cerium is known to enhance photocatalytic performance by introducing
oxygen vacancies and improving charge separation, which can extend the catalyst’s activity into
the visible light range. The presence of this peak provides strong evidence of cerium doping and
highlights its contribution to the catalyst's structural and functional properties.
Interestingly, the XRD spectra do not exhibit peaks corresponding to silver, even though it is a
component of the tri-doped photocatalysts. This can be explained by the relatively low
concentration of silver used in the synthesis process and the significantly larger ionic radius of
silver compared to titanium and cerium. The small quantity and dispersion of silver within the
TiO₂ matrix likely result in its XRD signal being below the detection limit. However, silver's
contribution to the photocatalytic activity should not be underestimated, as it can enhance the
catalyst's performance through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects and improved electron
trapping.
Similarly, no discernible peaks corresponding to boron were observed in the XRD spectra. Boron
is typically incorporated into the lattice of TiO₂ at substitutional or interstitial sites, causing lattice
distortion rather than forming distinct crystalline phases. As a result, its presence is not directly
detectable through XRD but can significantly influence the material's electronic properties, such
as reducing the bandgap and enhancing visible light absorption.
The absence of detectable silver and boron peaks in the XRD spectra does not diminish their role
in the photocatalysts' performance. On the contrary, the absence of these peaks suggests successful
doping at the atomic level without forming separate crystalline phases, which is desirable for
maintaining the anatase structure's integrity and photocatalytic efficiency. The synergy between
the three dopants—boron, cerium, and silver—likely contributes to enhanced photocatalytic
activity through various mechanisms, including improved charge separation, extended light
absorption, and enhanced reactive oxygen species generation.
In summary, the XRD analysis confirms that the synthesis process effectively produced tri-doped
photocatalysts with a predominantly anatase phase and successful incorporation of cerium. While
silver and boron do not produce distinct peaks in the spectra, their presence at the atomic level is
inferred and plays a crucial role in the material's photocatalytic properties. These findings validate
the synthesis approach and highlight the structural features that underpin the photocatalysts'
potential for environmental applications, such as the degradation of ciprofloxacin and other
pollutants. Future studies could complement XRD analysis with other characterization techniques,
such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to
provide further insights into the distribution and role of the dopants.

3.5 SEM Analysis
The SEM images of the three catalysts employed in this work are given in Fig. 4 below. The
pictures obtained from SEM analysis show that the three catalysts are quite identical in appearance
and appear as loosely packed irregular or elongated aggregates with a coarse surface.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis is an essential tool for understanding the surface
morphology and microstructural features of photocatalysts. Fig. 4 showcases the SEM images of
the
three
tri-doped
photocatalysts
(B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂,
B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO₂,
and
B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO₂) employed in this study. These images provide valuable insights into the
physical structure of the catalysts, which can directly influence their photocatalytic performance.
The SEM images reveal that all three photocatalysts exhibit similar morphological features,
suggesting that the synthesis procedure is consistent and reproducible across the different doping
configurations. The catalysts appear as loosely packed aggregates with irregular or elongated
shapes. This aggregation is typical in doped TiO₂ materials, where the synthesis process can lead
to particles clustering together during drying or calcination.
The coarse surface texture observed in the SEM images is a notable characteristic. Such a surface
morphology can enhance photocatalytic activity by providing a larger surface area for light
absorption and interaction with pollutants. Additionally, the irregular shapes and porous
appearance of the aggregates may facilitate better adsorption of target molecules, such as
ciprofloxacin (CIP), onto the catalyst surface.
The loosely packed and irregular nature of the aggregates suggests that the catalysts have a high
degree of porosity. Porosity is advantageous in photocatalysis as it allows better mass transfer of
reactants and products during the reaction. The coarse surfaces observed in the images further
indicate the presence of surface defects or irregularities, which can serve as active sites for
photocatalytic reactions. Such surface features are particularly beneficial for generating and
sustaining reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are crucial for degrading pollutants like CIP.
Despite their identical appearance, subtle differences in particle size or distribution, which may
not be immediately apparent from SEM images, could influence the performance of the three
catalysts. For example, the doping levels of boron, cerium, and silver may slightly alter the surface
properties, such as the number and type of active sites or the extent of light absorption. While these
differences are not visually discernible in the SEM images, their impact is evident from the
photocatalytic activity results presented in this study.
The aggregation observed in the SEM images is a common phenomenon in photocatalyst synthesis
and can influence performance. While some degree of aggregation is acceptable, excessive
aggregation could reduce the effective surface area available for photocatalysis. This is particularly

critical in tri-doped systems where dopants need to be evenly distributed to maximize their
synergistic effects. Future studies could focus on optimizing synthesis conditions, such as
calcination temperature or solvent use, to minimize aggregation and improve catalyst dispersion.
While SEM provides detailed morphological information, it does not offer direct insights into the
chemical composition or distribution of dopants within the photocatalysts. Techniques like Energy
Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) could
complement SEM to confirm the homogeneity of dopant distribution and identify any
microstructural variations between the catalysts.
The SEM analysis of the three tri-doped photocatalysts reveals consistent morphological
characteristics, with all samples displaying loosely packed, irregular aggregates and coarse
surfaces. This morphology is well-suited for photocatalytic applications, as it enhances surface
area and provides active sites for pollutant degradation. However, the aggregation observed in the
images highlights the need for further optimization of synthesis parameters to improve catalyst
dispersion and maximize performance.
Overall, the SEM findings validate the synthesis procedure and underscore the structural features
that contribute to the photocatalysts' activity in degrading pollutants like CIP. Complementary
characterization techniques and additional optimization could further enhance the performance and
applicability of these materials for environmental remediation.

4.0 Photocatalytic degradation of CIP

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0z4rr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-1797 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

The degradation studies of CIP for the tri-doped photocatalysts i.e., B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2,
B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO2, and B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO2 were carried out under UV-A light at room temperature
for three different concentrations of CIP (Fig. 5) at a catalyst loading of 1 g/L. To compare the tridoped catalyst performance with TiO2, the degradation study was carried out with TiO2. TiO2
showed almost 100% degradation in all the cases which is expected as this catalyst works more
efficiently under UV irradiation. Also compared to TiO2, the tridoped photocatalysts do not show
significantly better adsorption. From Fig. 5, it is evident that B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2 is the best performing
catalysts across the concentrations of CIP studied giving around 54% at 10 ppm concentration.
The photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP), a widely used antibiotic, has become a
critical research area due to its environmental persistence and adverse effects on ecosystems. Tridoped TiO₂ photocatalysts with co-doping of boron (B), cerium (Ce), and silver (Ag) offer
promising avenues for enhancing degradation efficiency. This study investigates the performance
of three tri-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts—B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂, B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO₂, and
B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO₂—compared to bare TiO₂ under UV-A light irradiation for different CIP
concentrations (10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 30 ppm) at room temperature.

4.1 Experimental Conditions
The degradation experiments were performed with a catalyst loading of 1 g/L. UV-A light was
chosen as the irradiation source due to TiO₂’s high efficiency in absorbing UV light. The baseline
performance of bare TiO₂ was assessed alongside the tri-doped variants to establish comparative
insights. TiO₂, known for its excellent photocatalytic activity under UV light, served as a
benchmark due to its nearly 100% degradation efficiency across all studied CIP concentrations.

4.2 Observations and Performance of Catalysts
TiO₂ demonstrated near-complete degradation of CIP in all cases, consistent with its established
role as a highly active photocatalyst under UV-A light. The complete mineralization of CIP
indicates that the intrinsic photocatalytic properties of TiO₂ remain unparalleled under optimal
conditions, primarily due to its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals efficiently.
The performance of the tri-doped catalysts was comparatively modest, with degradation
efficiencies significantly lower than bare TiO₂. However, these catalysts exhibited notable
differences among themselves:
a. B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂: This catalyst emerged as the best performer among the tridoped variants, achieving a degradation efficiency of approximately 54% at 10 ppm
CIP concentration. The enhanced performance can be attributed to an optimized
balance of dopant concentrations, which likely improved charge carrier separation
and reduced recombination rates.
b. B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO₂ and B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO₂: These catalysts showed relatively
lower degradation efficiencies, indicating that the specific doping levels in
B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ provided a more favorable catalytic environment for CIP
degradation.
Despite the presence of dopants, the tri-doped catalysts did not exhibit significantly enhanced
adsorption properties compared to bare TiO₂. This finding suggests that the dopants primarily
influence the photocatalytic process through electronic and structural modifications rather than
surface adsorption capabilities. The adsorption phase, critical for effective degradation, appears
more reliant on the intrinsic surface properties of the catalyst rather than doping-induced changes.

4.3 Role of Dopants in Photocatalytic Activity
The incorporation of B, Ce, and Ag into the TiO₂ lattice aims to improve photocatalytic efficiency
by:


Boron (B): Enhances the surface acidity and improves charge carrier separation.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0z4rr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-1797 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0




Cerium (Ce): Acts as an electron scavenger, reducing electron-hole recombination and
extending the lifetime of charge carriers.
Silver (Ag): Provides plasmonic effects under light irradiation, improving visible light
absorption and charge transfer dynamics.

In the case of B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂, the optimized dopant ratio likely achieved a synergistic effect,
improving charge separation while maintaining an adequate surface area for photocatalytic
reactions. The suboptimal performance of other tri-doped catalysts may result from an imbalance
in dopant concentrations, leading to ineffective charge dynamics or structural defects that inhibit
photocatalytic efficiency.
The photocatalytic performance of the catalysts decreased with increasing CIP concentration. At
higher concentrations, the availability of active sites on the catalyst surface becomes limited, while
the absorption of UV-A light by CIP itself reduces the photons available for photocatalytic
activation. This phenomenon underscores the importance of optimizing catalyst loading and CIP
concentration for practical applications.

4.4 Comparison of Degradation Efficiencies
The superior performance of bare TiO₂ underscores its unmatched photocatalytic activity under
UV-A light. However, the tri-doped catalysts present potential advantages in specific scenarios,
particularly under conditions where visible light activation or reduced recombination is necessary.
The modest improvement in photocatalytic efficiency with the best-performing tri-doped catalyst
(B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂) suggests further optimization of dopant ratios and synthesis methods is
necessary to rival the performance of bare TiO₂.
To improve the degradation efficiency of tri-doped catalysts:
1. Optimize Dopant Ratios: Conduct systematic studies on the effects of varying B, Ce, and
Ag concentrations to identify optimal doping levels.
2. Explore Visible Light Activation: Modify tri-doped catalysts to enhance their activity
under visible light, expanding their applicability beyond UV light.
3. Improve Surface Properties: Introduce additional treatments or co-doping with other
elements to enhance adsorption capacity and surface reactivity.
4. Analyze Reaction Mechanisms: Investigate the intermediate species formed during
degradation to understand the mechanistic role of dopants.
While the tri-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts exhibit potential for CIP degradation, their performance
under UV-A light remains inferior to that of bare TiO₂. The study highlights the critical influence
of dopant concentrations and underscores the challenges in balancing adsorption and
photocatalytic efficiency in modified catalysts. B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ shows promise as the bestperforming tri-doped catalyst, achieving 54% degradation at 10 ppm CIP concentration. Future
research should focus on optimizing dopant levels, enhancing visible light activity, and improving
surface adsorption properties to maximize the utility of tri-doped photocatalysts in environmental
remediation applications.
The findings from this study provide a foundation for advancing photocatalytic technology for
environmental applications, particularly for addressing persistent pollutants like ciprofloxacin
(CIP). The insights gained into the performance of tri-doped photocatalysts open several avenues
for improvement and future exploration.

4.5 Detailed Mechanistic Understanding
A thorough investigation into the photocatalytic degradation pathway of CIP is essential for
improving catalyst design. This involves identifying the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated
during the reaction and understanding their interactions with CIP molecules. Hydroxyl radicals
(•OH), superoxide anions (O₂•⁻), and singlet oxygen (¹O₂) are often the primary ROS in
photocatalysis, and their relative contributions should be quantified. Additionally, the degradation

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0z4rr ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-1797 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

intermediates formed during the process should be identified and analyzed for toxicity to ensure
complete mineralization of CIP into harmless byproducts.
The limited performance of the tri-doped catalysts under UV-A light suggests that future research
should focus on extending their activity into the visible spectrum. Visible light constitutes a
significant portion of solar radiation, making it crucial for real-world applications. Strategies to
achieve this include:




Bandgap Engineering: Further reducing the bandgap of TiO₂ by optimizing dopant levels
to enable absorption of visible light.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR): Incorporating noble metals like Ag at specific
concentrations to harness SPR effects for visible light activation.
Coupling with Other Semiconductors: Combining TiO₂ with narrow-bandgap
semiconductors, such as CdS or ZnO, to form heterojunctions that enhance charge
separation and broaden the light absorption range.

The study was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions with a fixed catalyst loading of 1
g/L. Scaling up these findings for industrial or municipal wastewater treatment requires addressing
several challenges. Developing efficient photocatalytic reactors that maximize light penetration
and catalyst utilization. Ensuring that the catalysts can be easily separated and reused without
significant loss of activity. Optimizing the synthesis process to reduce costs while maintaining or
improving performance.

4.6 Addressing Catalyst Stability
Catalyst stability is a critical factor in long-term applications. While dopants like Ag improve
activity, they can also lead to photocorrosion under prolonged exposure. Protective measures, such
as coating the catalyst with stable layers or incorporating dopants that enhance structural integrity,
should be considered.
To improve efficiency, photocatalysis can be integrated with other treatment methods, such as:




Adsorption: Using adsorbents like activated carbon alongside photocatalysts to preconcentrate pollutants.
Biodegradation: Combining photocatalysis with biological treatment to address
degradation intermediates that may be resistant to further photocatalytic breakdown.
Membrane Filtration: Incorporating membranes to separate and concentrate catalysts,
allowing for continuous operation.

The degradation of CIP and other antibiotics is crucial for reducing antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) in the environment. However, intermediate byproducts formed during degradation may
exhibit residual toxicity or antibiotic activity. Comprehensive toxicity assessments are necessary
to ensure that the photocatalytic process not only degrades pollutants but also mitigates their
harmful effects.
Beyond antibiotic degradation, tri-doped TiO₂ catalysts can be explored for other environmental
applications, such as:




Disinfection: Killing pathogenic microorganisms in water and wastewater.
Degradation of Other Pollutants: Targeting dyes, pesticides, and industrial chemicals
that pose environmental risks.
Air Purification: Removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other air pollutants.

Evaluating the performance of tri-doped catalysts under varying environmental conditions, such
as changes in temperature, pH, and real wastewater matricesConducting in-depth studies to
understand the interactions between B, Ce, and Ag and their collective influence on photocatalytic
activity. Assessing the durability and stability of tri-doped catalysts over multiple cycles of use.
Developing eco-friendly synthesis methods that minimize environmental impact while producing
high-performance catalysts.

This study highlights the potential of tri-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts for the degradation of
ciprofloxacin (CIP). Among the catalysts tested, B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ emerged as the most effective,
achieving a degradation efficiency of 54% at 10 ppm CIP concentration under UV-A light.
However, the performance of these tri-doped catalysts remains inferior to bare TiO₂ under UV
conditions. The findings underscore the importance of optimizing dopant levels, enhancing visible
light activity, and addressing challenges related to large-scale application.
Future research should focus on refining the design and synthesis of tri-doped photocatalysts to
achieve superior performance, particularly under visible light. Additionally, scaling up the process
for industrial applications and integrating it with other treatment methods can enhance its practical
utility. By addressing these challenges, photocatalytic degradation using advanced catalysts can
play a pivotal role in mitigating environmental pollution and reducing the risks associated with
antimicrobial resistance.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the photocatalyst degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic has been carried out by
using three tri-doped photocatalysts i.e., B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2, B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO2, and B1Ce1Ag0.06
TiO2. The photocatalytic degradation capability of B1Ce1Ag0.1 was comparatively higher than the
remaining two doped catalysts, as it degraded 54% in 120 min. These results concluded that
B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO2 was the best performing tri-doped photocatalyst. The performance of the tri-doped
catalysts under UV-A irradiation was not encouraging and these catalysts need to be tested under
visible or sun light for obtaining better results. Further work is needed to check the effectiveness
of the catalyst in large scale. This study focused on evaluating the photocatalytic degradation of
ciprofloxacin, a commonly used antibiotic, using three tri-doped titanium dioxide (TiO₂)
photocatalysts: B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂, B1Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO₂, and B1Ce1Ag0.06TiO₂. Among the three
catalysts synthesized, B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ demonstrated the highest photocatalytic activity,
achieving a degradation efficiency of 54% within 120 minutes under UV-A irradiation. This result
highlights the potential of tri-doping with boron, cerium, and silver in enhancing the photocatalytic
performance of TiO₂. However, the overall performance under UV-A light was moderate,
indicating the need for further optimization and testing under broader light spectra, particularly
visible or sunlight, to harness the full potential of these materials.
The enhanced performance of B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ compared to the other two tri-doped catalysts can
be attributed to the optimized concentration of dopants, which likely contributed to better light
absorption, charge carrier separation, and reduced recombination rates. The synergy among the
dopants—boron, cerium, and silver—played a crucial role in modifying the electronic and
structural properties of TiO₂. Boron and cerium are known to introduce intermediate energy levels
within the band gap, facilitating the utilization of lower-energy photons, while silver enhances the
charge separation efficiency and acts as a co-catalyst. This combination allowed B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂
to achieve superior photocatalytic degradation compared to the other formulations.
Despite the promising results, the degradation efficiency under UV-A light was not as high as
desired. Pure TiO₂ is inherently limited by its large band gap (~3.2 eV), which restricts its activity
to UV light, constituting only ~5% of the solar spectrum. Although doping slightly narrowed the
band gap, enabling some improvement in light absorption, the catalysts' activity under UV-A
irradiation remained suboptimal. This indicates that the doped catalysts are not fully exploiting the
potential of the visible or solar light spectrum, which constitutes a much larger portion of available
light. Future work should focus on exploring these catalysts under visible light or direct sunlight
to evaluate their performance in more practical, real-world scenarios.

While the laboratory-scale tests provided valuable insights into the photocatalytic performance of
the tri-doped catalysts, scaling up these processes for industrial applications poses several
challenges. The synthesis process, though efficient and eco-friendly, needs to be optimized for
large-scale production to ensure uniform doping and reproducibility. Additionally, the catalysts'
long-term stability, recyclability, and performance in complex wastewater matrices containing
various organic and inorganic contaminants must be thoroughly investigated.
Further research should also consider enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency by exploring
alternative doping strategies, co-catalysts, or nanostructuring techniques. For instance, coupling
TiO₂ with other semiconductors that exhibit strong visible light activity, such as graphene oxide
or zinc oxide, could create hybrid systems with superior performance. Investigating the role of
synthesis parameters, such as calcination temperature, pH, and precursor concentrations, may yield
insights into further improving the catalysts' properties.
Since the current study primarily focused on UV-A light, expanding the scope to include visible
light and sunlight irradiation is crucial. Visible light-responsive photocatalysts have significant
practical advantages, as sunlight is a sustainable and abundant energy source. Testing the tri-doped
catalysts under simulated solar light would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their
performance and applicability for environmental remediation. Incorporating field-scale
experiments could also help assess their real-world efficacy, considering factors such as light
intensity variations, water flow rates, and the presence of competing substances in wastewater.
The ability to effectively degrade ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics in wastewater has profound
environmental and public health implications. Persistent antibiotics in wastewater contribute to the
growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which poses a global health crisis. Developing
efficient photocatalysts capable of eliminating these pollutants not only helps mitigate AMR but
also supports cleaner water resources. The use of sunlight as an energy source aligns with
sustainable development goals, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources and
minimizing operational costs.
In conclusion, the study demonstrates that tri-doping TiO₂ with boron, cerium, and silver can
significantly enhance photocatalytic activity, with B1Ce1Ag0.1TiO₂ emerging as the most
effective catalyst among those tested. While the performance under UV-A irradiation was
moderate, the results highlight the potential of these materials for visible and solar light-driven
photocatalytic applications. Moving forward, optimizing the synthesis process, exploring broader
light spectra, and conducting large-scale tests will be crucial to realizing the practical application
of these catalysts for wastewater treatment and combating antibiotic pollution. By addressing these
challenges, tri-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts could become a cornerstone technology in the fight
against AMR and environmental contamination, paving the way for cleaner, safer water systems.
Building on the findings of this study, a multi-faceted approach is required to optimize the
performance and applicability of tri-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts. Research efforts should focus on
improving the catalyst design to enhance light absorption, reduce recombination rates of electronhole pairs, and maximize the degradation efficiency for a broader range of pollutants. Some
specific strategies include:
Fine-tuning the concentrations of boron, cerium, and silver can further optimize the catalyst's
properties. Experimental studies combined with computational modeling can help predict the ideal
dopant configurations for achieving the desired band gap and surface characteristics. Controlling
the morphology of TiO₂, such as creating nanosheets, nanotubes, or hollow spheres, can increase
the surface area and improve light harvesting. These features allow better pollutant adsorption and
enhance photocatalytic activity. Coating the catalyst surface with materials like graphene, carbon
nanotubes, or conducting polymers can improve charge mobility and reduce recombination. These
materials also contribute to broader light absorption, extending the catalyst's activity into the
visible spectrum.
Creating heterojunctions with other semiconductors, such as cadmium sulfide (CdS) or tungsten
oxide (WO₃), can enhance the charge separation efficiency and promote visible light activity.
Developing methods to improve the durability and reusability of the photocatalysts is essential for
sustainable applications. Stability testing under prolonged light exposure and in harsh
environmental conditions can provide insights into material resilience.

Beyond ciprofloxacin degradation, the synthesized catalysts have potential applications in
addressing various environmental challenges .The catalysts could be employed for degrading a
wide range of pharmaceutical contaminants, dyes, pesticides, and other organic pollutants
commonly found in industrial wastewater. Modified TiO₂ photocatalysts can be used to degrade
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other air pollutants under sunlight.
The catalysts can serve dual roles in disinfecting water by degrading bacterial cells and addressing
antimicrobial resistance by eliminating antibiotic residues. To transition from laboratory studies
to real-world applications, collaborations between researchers, industry stakeholders, and
policymakers are crucial. Such partnerships can drive innovation in scaling up production,
integrating photocatalytic systems into existing wastewater treatment plants, and addressing
regulatory requirements. Demonstration projects and pilot-scale implementations would help
bridge the gap between research and commercialization.
The study marks a significant step toward developing advanced photocatalysts for environmental
remediation. The tri-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts exhibit promise, particularly with their modified
band gap and improved degradation capabilities. However, their moderate performance under UVA light emphasizes the need for further testing and optimization under visible and solar light to
achieve their full potential. As the field of photocatalysis continues to evolve, integrating these
advancements into practical systems will play a vital role in addressing critical issues such as water
pollution and antimicrobial resistance. By refining these catalysts and expanding their scope, this
research lays the groundwork for sustainable solutions that align with global efforts to protect the
environment and public health.
