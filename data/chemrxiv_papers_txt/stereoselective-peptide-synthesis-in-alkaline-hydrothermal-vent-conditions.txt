Modern proteins are composed exclusively of L-amino acids but the origin of Lstereospecificity is unresolved. Carbonaceous meteorites were a significant source of organic
matter on early Earth and commonly contain ten proteogenic amino acids in racemic mixtures.
In conditions relevant to early Earth hydrothermal vents, surface-catalyzed peptide syntheses
of these proteogenic mixtures show modest reaction rates and no significant stereoselectivity.
However, we show that the presence of cysteine significantly increases peptide synthesis yields
in the presence of silicate surfaces, with synthetic yields displaying a strong stereoselective
bias towards L-cysteine. In a hydrothermal vent solvent model, L-cysteine doubles the increase
in peptide synthetic yields compared to D-cysteine, as indicated by UV absorption, NMR, and
mass spectrometry. Solid state NMR confirms that cysteine associates with silicates at alkaline
pH via both carboxylate and sulfur groups. This adsorption results in a stereospecific
orientation of the reactive amino group for surface-adsorbed bivalently charged amino acids
detectable by Polarization-Resolved IRRAS. This stereospecific amino group reorientation
provides a novel mechanism for abiotic peptide synthesis favoring L-amino acids on achiral
surfaces, which is applicable to any bivalently charged amino acid at alkaline pH. Our findings
here, that cysteine is incorporated stereoselectively in surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis,
combined with the metal-binding capability of abiotically synthesized cysteine-bearing
peptides, emphasizes the potential benefits of amino acids with sulfur functional groups to
fundamental processes in early life and the potential usefulness of such amino acids as
biosignatures.

Introduction

Proteins are essential components of life, but their pre-biotic origins remain unresolved (1).
Carbon-rich meteorites contain up to 2300ppm of amino acids and are proposed to have been
a major source of the early Earth’s inventory of organic molecules (2,3) Amino acids and their
peptide polymers may have formed alongside, or even before, the first RNAs in a “peptideRNA world”(4).

The amino acids glycine, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, valine, isoleucine, leucine, serine,
threonine, and proline, are found in carbonaceous meteorites and together are known as the
abiotic amino acid set (5, 6) This set is restricted to neutral or negatively charged sidechains
and offers limited potential functionality and no known mechanism for facilitating proteinmediated redox activity due to their low sidechain nucleophilicity (7).

Several mechanisms have been proposed for synthesis of peptides from this set, including salt
induced peptide formation(8) and activating agent catalyzed peptide synthesis (9, 10). The best
explored of these synthetic routes is surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis, first proposed by
Bernal et al. (11) and since documented under a wide range of reaction conditions (12) and
minerals.(13) Mineral surfaces catalyze peptide synthesis by binding amino acids, typically
through electrostatic interactions, and increasing local amino acid concentrations (12, 13) The
extent to which a particular surface can enhance peptide synthesis is driven predominantly by
residence times on the mineral surface, which depend on the strength of the interaction and
electrostatics that affect diffusion near the surface (13).

Abiotic peptide synthesis is facilitated by deprotonation of the zwitterionic amino group to
form the more nucleophilic NH2 group, which occurs at alkaline pH (~9.52) (14). Moderate
heating also facilitates synthesis since peptide bond formation is favorable at >60˚C,(15),(16)
but diketopiperazine formation is favored at ≥120˚C (17). This observation has led to the
proposal of alkaline hydrothermal vent systems, such as the white smokers of the Atlantis
Massif, as possible sites for the formation of Earth’s first proteins (18). The Enceladian ocean
is proposed to contain similar vents (19), providing hot (~90˚C), alkaline (pH ~9.5) conditions
(20,21).

While peptide synthesis from amino acids can be catalyzed by high salt, metals, and surfaces,
peptide bond yields are typically low and peptide lengths typically limited to ~2-6 amino acids
(22, 18, 23, 24, 25). In surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis, this limitation is a consequence of
the relatively weak association between peptides and the mineral surface, and the formation of
peptide-chain terminating end products such as piperazines (22). In addition, stereoselectivity
in abiotic peptide syntheses, which may have contributed to the L-amino acid homochirality
observed in life today (26), is typically low or absent. A <10% preference for L-amino acids
was observed for metal-mediated catalysis in high salt conditions but the mechanism not
identified (27), and reported peptide syntheses with >25% stereoselectivity depend on chiral
templating minerals (28) or chiral biotic precursors (29). Thus, none of the currently described
synthetic processes provide a general mechanism for high yield and stereoselective synthesis
of longer peptides (18).

74
75

We hypothesize that the addition of amino acids with higher reactivity to a surface-catalyzed
peptide synthesis system could circumvent both low peptide yields and the low

stereoselectivity of previously reported approaches. While excluded from previous surfacecatalyzed peptide synthesis studies, the sulfur functional group of cysteine is dramatically more
nucleophilic than any other amino acid (7) and anticipated to greatly increase surface
interactions of cysteine monomers and cysteine-bearing peptides in surface/solvent interfaces.
All biogenic proteins have methionine as the first amino acid, suggesting sulfur-bearing amino
acids may have been present in the earliest stages of life, and previous work suggests that the
presence of sulfur was essential to the origin of life’s metabolic pathways (30) and of peptide
ligation in aqueous solutions(31, 32), but the effects of including a sulfur-bearing amino acid
like cysteine in abiotic surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis systems has not yet been
investigated.

Investigating abiotic peptide synthesis in the presence of simple amino acids with sulfur
functional groups like cysteine is also motivated by the unique capabilities such amino acids
could have provided to nascent life by generating peptides able to coordinate, and therefore
utilize, soluble metal ions. Modern proteins often coordinate metabolically active transition
metals such as iron, copper, nickel and cobalt through cysteine. The cysteine thiol can readily
coordinate metals in solution (33), and in proteins like thioredoxins they directly mediate
reduction-oxidation chemistry (34).

Here, we investigated the potential role of the highly nucleophilic thiol in abiotic peptide
synthesis in a surface-based reaction mechanism. We found that the addition of cysteine in the
presence of a silicate surface increased peptide synthesis 7.8-fold, producing peptides as large
as 12 amino acids in length, and that peptide yields were 50% stereoselective for L-cysteine,
over D-cysteine. Our results are consistent with an unusually strong stereospecific silicate
mineral association mechanism for cysteine. We show that cysteine adsorbs onto the abundant
mineral surface SiO2 through both the carboxylate and sulfur groups simultaneously and that
the amino group is stereospecifically oriented in the surface-bound state. We propose that the
stereospecific surface orientation of the amino group in bivalently surface-bound Lenantiomers is responsible for the observed rate enhancement. Our work points to the
possibility that the most efficient mechanism for stereoselective peptide bond formation is
bivalent surface catalysis under alkaline reducing conditions like those found at hydrothermal
vents. The increased abiotic yield and metal binding capability (35, 36) of thiols indicate that
cysteine or other amino acids with sulfur functional groups could be essential ingredients for
abiogenesis.

A reaction scheme was established based on the oxide mineral and amino acid reaction systems
of Takahagi (17). All reaction mixtures contained a racemic meteoric amino acid mixture
(MAAM) supplemented with an additional L- or D-amino acid at excess concentration to test
its effect on peptide yields. The mineral surface was simulated with heat-sterilized pyroxene or
fumed spectroscopy grade SiO2 in borosilicate or polypropylene reaction vessels, and reaction
mixtures were heated in reducing conditions at 90°C for the times indicated. Consistent with
surface-catalysis, reactions in borosilicate vessels led to 1.8-fold increases in peptide yields
over reactions in polypropylene vessels due to the additional silicate surface area (Figure S1a).

Initial assessment of peptide yield was conducted by UV-spectrophotometry.(37) Statistical
significance of differences in absorption was determined through one way ANOVA with Tukey
post hoc analysis to determine the effect of e ach tested excess amino acid on peptide yield
compared to an L-alanine negative control (Table S1). In borosilicate reaction vessels,
absorption of 230nm light (A230) increased significantly after 48 hours in the presence of Lcysteine compared to reactions with either L-alanine (p=<0.0001) or D-cysteine (p=0.0006).
In contrast, synthesis with excess L- or D-alanine (p=0.7172), and L-alanine or L-methionine
(p=0.7021) did not result in significantly increased peptide yields, indicating that these
enantiomers adsorbed to silicates similarly at alkaline pH. When compared to the mean
absorbances for L-alanine, D-alanine and L-methionine, the presence of L-cysteine increased
peptide bond yield 7.8-fold (±0.6), and D-cysteine increased absorbance 3.9-fold (±0.6)
(Figure 1a).

The presence of silicate surfaces significantly amplifies the catalytic effect of cysteine on
peptide bond formation. In the absence of a silicate surface, peptide bond yields were increased
approximately 3-fold, consistent with a previous report (31), and the addition of a silicate
surface (pyroxene) increased this value another 6-fold (p=0.0015; two-tailed unpaired t-test)
(Figure 1b, Table S2). The apparent rates of reaction after 48 hours for systems containing
pyroxene and either L-cysteine, D-cysteine or L-alanine in 5mM excess were 0.76, 0.38, and
0.12 mM of peptide bonds per hour, respectively.

The depletion of monomeric amino acids and the formation of peptide species during the
reaction was confirmed using solution NMR. Quantitative NMR (qNMR) measurements after
48-hour reactions with either L-cysteine or L-alanine indicated that 7.7-fold more monomeric
L-cysteine was removed than L-alanine (Figure 1c). 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy
(TOCSY) of the reacted mixtures revealed signals consistent with cysteine 1HN-1Hα and 1HN1
Hβ correlations that were not observed in the unreacted control samples (Figure 1e).

The synthesis products were further characterized by repeating the reactions using isotopically
labelled amino acids for analysis by 13C NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectra of products formed
in the presence of 13Cβ L-cysteine after heating at 90°C for 48 hours indicated a large number
of unique signals in the chemical shift range expected for non-oxidized cysteine 1Hβ-13Cβ and
1
Hα-13Cα correlations, as well as amide 1H to 1Hα and 1Hβ, which were consistent with the
formation of a diverse set of cysteine-bearing peptides (Figure 2a-b). In contrast to the
reactions with cysteine, few unique signals were observed when synthesis was conducted in
the presence of 13C-labelled L-methionine (Figure S3).

Peptide compositions and lengths were evaluated using Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry
Time-of-Flight (TIMS-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) after 42 days at 90˚C followed by
purification using C18 solid phase extraction (SPE). Synthesis conducted in the presence of Lcysteine generated the largest number of unique peptide detections (Figure 2d). The peptide
diversities detected by TIMS-TOF MS were likely underestimated due to the C18 peptide
purification conducted prior to HPLC/TIMS-TOF MS, which enriches samples in hydrophobic
peptides (Figure S4). In the presence of L-cysteine, significantly larger numbers of unique
peptides longer than four amino acids were detected compared to L-alanine (Mann Whitney
Test, p=0.0188, Table S3), and peptides containing up to 12 amino acids were observed. In the
presence of L-alanine the largest observed peptide was an 8-mer, and fewer unique peptides

were observed overall. Increases in the number of detectable peptides were also observed with
D-cysteine compared to L-alanine, but not to statistical significance (p=0.1563) (Figure S5,
Table S4). The increased detections of peptides in reactions with L-cysteine compared with Dcysteine and L-alanine were consistent with the yields determined from A230 and qNMR and
supported a stereoselective bias toward L-cysteine.

168

Increased peptide yields with cysteine are due to the thiol.

The increased peptide yields with L- and D-cysteine compared to L-alanine correlate with the
high nucleophilicity of the sidechain thiol, (7) which results in strong attachment to mineral
surfaces. Reactions in the presence of L-homocysteine showed a comparable level of peptide
bond formation to L-cysteine (Figure S1b) whereas L-methionine showed no statistically
significant increase in peptide bond formation compared to L-alanine (Figure 1b). Reaction
yields with excess L-aspartate were higher than the yields with excess L-alanine (Figure S1b),
suggesting that attachment through the carboxylate sidechain can also contribute to increased
yields. However, the yields with L-aspartate were much lower than that of reactions with excess
L-cysteine, consistent with the much lower nucleophilicity (7) and weaker silicate binding of
the sidechain carboxylate group (38).

180
181
182
183
184
185

We also observed a high correlation between peptide yield in the presence of different metal
oxides and the corresponding metal-sulfur bond dissociation energies, confirming that the
strength of attachment via the sulfur group to the mineral surface is the dominant factor
affecting peptide yield (Figure S3). In contrast, silicate-sulfur bonds have very high
dissociation energies and the yield in the presence of silicate was lower than expected from the
trend observed for metal oxides, which may indicate that adsorption was no longer rate-limiting
(39).

NMR and MS results supported the observations by UV spectroscopy that cysteine
stereoselectively enhances peptide yield when in the presence of an oxide mineral surface. The
stereoselective bias toward L-cysteine persisted at the lowest concentrations of amino acids
tested (55µM) (Figure 1d), indicating that peptides generated abiotically in the presence of
racemic cysteine monomers would be enriched with L-cysteine at a ratio similar to that of the
observed peptide yield increase.

Based on the observed effects of the sidechain thiol on peptide yields, and that amino acids in
neutral or alkaline pH can attach to mineral surfaces via charged groups (13, 38), we
hypothesized that bivalent surface attachment to mineral surfaces via both the carboxylate and
sulfur groups, concurrent with deprotonation of the amino group at alkaline pH, could provide
a mechanism for the observed stereoselective differences in peptide yields. Two-point
attachment of cysteine via its carboxylate and sulfur groups restricts rotation of the amino acid
at the mineral surface, leading to stereospecific differences in the orientation of the amino
group, which could affect either the energetics of surface attachment (e.g., through steric clash)
or the rates of peptide bond formation through positioning of the amino group for nucleophilic
attack.

203
204
205

To test this, we first confirmed that cysteine binds to silicate surfaces through its sulfur and
carboxylate groups simultaneously. Amino acid surface attachment results in changes in its
electronic environment, which can be observed in NMR spectroscopy. Solid state 13C cross

polarization spectra of silicate/cysteine complexes revealed multiple resolvable signals
attributable to silicate-bound cysteine (Figure 3a), which exhibited chemical shifts distinct
from that of unbound cysteine or cystine (Figure S6). For L-cysteine, three 13Cβ resonances
with similar or identical chemical shifts were resolvable in samples prepared at both pH 1.5
and pH 10.5 (Figure 3b), indicating that the sulfur attachment occurs over a wide pH range.
The two upfield shifted 13Cβ signals likely indicated the presence of noncovalent,
electrostatically bound complexes of the cysteine sulfur group with the silicate surface. In
contrast, the downfield shifted 13Cβ signal at 43ppm agreed with the chemical shift reported for
the 13Cβ of cysteine bound to gold (40), and likely reflects a covalent silicothioether bond (–SiS-C(H2)–). The presence of this covalent bond was confirmed by Polarization Resolved
Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (PR-IRRAS) (41) on samples of cysteine
adsorbed to silicate films, which showed an absorption band for p polarized light at 1407cm-1
(Figure S7), consistent with the previously reported IR absorption of the Si-S-CH2 in silicon
bound ethanethiol (1406cm-1) (42).

In contrast to the 13Cβ signals, the 13Cα of L-cysteine exhibited a single resonance in all samples
but with stereospecific chemical shifts and line-broadening (Figure 3). At pH 10.5, the 13Cα
chemical shift (51.58ppm) was shifted upfield relative to the silicate-free cysteine 13Cα
(54.69ppm), consistent with a significant electronic change attributed to bivalent binding to
silicate. The pH 1.5 chemical shifts of the L-cysteine 13Cα and carboxylate 13C were consistent
with monovalent association and the release of the carboxylate/silicate interaction: the cysteine
13
Cα chemical shift at low pH (54.65ppm) was similar to that of silicate-free cysteine
(54.69ppm), and the intense, upfield shifted carboxylate 13C resonance observed at pH 10.5
(170.82 and 167.02ppm) was replaced at pH 1.5 by two downfield shifted carboxylate
resonances (172.37ppm and 170.54ppm). Given that the cysteine carboxylate has a pKa of 1.92,
we attributed the signal at 172.37ppm to the protonated carboxylate, similar to that of the free
cysteine (172.11ppm), and the signal at 170.54 was attributed to the deprotonated carboxylate.

232
233
234
235
236

The high pH NMR spectra of D-cysteine bound to silicate indicated a similar number of 13Cβ
signals and with similar chemical shifts, consistent with sulfur-driven attachment, but with
lower signal-to-noise. The D-cysteine 13Cα signal was notably shifted and broadened compared
with that of L-cysteine (Figure 3ac), confirming that L- and D- enantiomers of cysteine have
stereospecific physical properties when bound to mineral surfaces.

239
240
241
242
243
244

We conclude that cysteine attaches bivalently through both the sidechain sulfur and mainchain
carboxylate at high pH but is attached predominantly monovalently via a sidechain sulfur at
low pH. The association of cysteine with silicate via the thiol group at low pH demonstrates
that the catalytic effect from increased residence time on the silicate surface would be
applicable across a wide pH range. The stereoselectivity of this catalytic effect is expected to
be possible at any pH greater than the pKa of the cysteine carboxylate (>pH 2.0), to enable
bivalent attachment, however detectable peptide synthesis yields are restricted to alkaline pH
(>9.50), which is required for amino group deprotonation (14).

The different physical properties that arise from bivalent surface attachment of enantiomers

adsorbed molecules. We predicted that a stereospecific reorientation of the amino group, which
is the site of peptide bond formation, should be observed for amino acids capable of bivalent

surface attachment but not for amino acids restricted to monovalent attachment at alkaline pH.
Following incubation with SiO2, all samples including the L- and D-alanine controls showed
reflectance in p polarized light but not s polarized light, consistent with the signals arising from
surface-bound amino acids. A clear stereospecific inversion of the reflectance corresponding
to the amino group (N-H) asymmetric bend (43) was observed for bivalently bound cysteine
and aspartate amino acids (Figure 4a-b) but not for the alanine control (Figure 4c). The amino
group band inversion observed for bivalently silicate adsorbed D-amino acids indicates a
different orientation of these amino groups relative to the plane of the surface compared to their
L-enantiomers, and provides a likely mechanism for the observed stereoselective differences
in the rate of peptide bond formation observed for cysteine.

How and why life began to make exclusive use of L-amino acids from a racemic prebiotic
amino acid mixture is an open question (18). We propose that the presence of cysteine within a
surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis system modeled on alkaline hydrothermal vents could have
a significant impact on peptide formation rates and could feasibly provide a stereoselective bias
for prebiotic chemistry. Cysteine enriched peptides have the additional benefit of being capable
of spontaneous metal ligation and redox activity (35, 36).

We show that the addition of cysteine to the conventional set of ten abiotically available amino
acids significantly increases peptide yield when heated in the presence of an oxide-mineral in
alkaline conditions. High peptide yields depended on the presence of a mineral substrate,
indicating that peptide formation occurs predominantly through surface catalysis. We also show
that cysteine interacts bivalently with silicate surfaces via a covalent Si-S bond and remains
bound after multiple washes, in contrast to glycine, which adsorbs weakly to silicate surfaces
and is almost completely removed after two wash cycles (44). Although the cysteine thiol
interacts with silicates across a wide pH range, stereoselective and high peptide yields can only
be achieved at alkaline pH because of the requirement for amino group deprotonation to
achieve high peptide yields (14). The cysteine mineral attachment is reversible in peptides, as
evidenced by the presence of readily purified cysteine bearing peptides in the supernatant.

Our peptide synthesis yields in the presence of cysteine displayed a marked stereoselective bias
towards the L enantiomer, with a 50% increase in peptide yield when synthesis was conducted
with L-cysteine compared to D-cysteine. The stereoselectivity of the yield was far greater than
observed in previous salt-induced peptide synthesis experiments (27), and achieved in
amorphous borosilicate glass. The increased yield in the presence of L-cysteine is attributed to
the stereospecific orientation of the amino group when bivalently bound to a silicate surface.
The amino group is the site of peptide bond formation, and its reorientation may change solvent
accessibility or introduce steric clashes that affect surface residence times, which in turn affect
the rate of peptide bond formation. We also found evidence of bivalent attachment of aspartate
to silicate, and a corresponding stereospecific orientation of the aspartate amino group, but the
much weaker nucleophilicity of the carboxylate and the corresponding weaker silicate
association (38) precluded observation of a significant stereoselective effect for aspartate on
the rate of peptide bond formation in our model system.

The presence of L-cysteine increased the lengths of peptides that were produced compared with
either D-cysteine or L-alanine. Our ability to detect longer peptides is likely due in part to an
overall increase in peptide yields, which suggests that cysteine incorporated into peptides
retains an increased affinity for silicate surfaces.

Although the longest peptides observed with L-cysteine were higher than those detected here
for L-alanine or reported elsewhere from oxide mineral catalyzed syntheses (22), these lengths
are well below that of a typical modern, protein domain. Due to changes in charge density the
strength of peptide binding to mineral surfaces decreases with increasing peptide length, which
limits the concentration of longer peptides at the mineral surface. A combination of surfacecatalyzed peptide elongation and peptide ligation in solution, facilitated by wet/dry cycles, has
been proposed (45), but model systems restricted to meteoritic amino acids have provided only
low yields of short peptides (22). The incorporation of cysteine into peptides opens the
possibility for novel mechanisms of peptide elongation in solution catalyzed by metal ion
binding via the sidechain thiol. Strong metal-sulfur binding would locally concentrate cysteinebearing peptides, which may increase the probability of peptide ligation compared with the
weaker metal chelation available to peptides restricted in composition to meteoritic amino
acids.

Our results indicate that the cysteine thiol catalyzes efficient and stereoselective peptide
synthesis in alkaline environments at 90˚C. Marine ‘white smoker’ hydrothermal vents found
on Earth, and possibly also at the bottom of the Enceladian ocean (21), present suitable
environments for such surface-catalyzed peptide synthesis reactions. Our results indicate that
abiotic peptides synthesized in such environments are likely to be enriched with the Lenantiomer of cysteine, and possibly also L-aspartate(38), through stereospecific orientation of
amino groups that results from bivalent surface attachment. Such disproportionate
incorporation of a subset of L-amino acids may have provided the stereochemical bias leading
to L-amino acid homochirality through stereospecific amplification (26, 46, 47).

The presence of an amino acid with a highly nucleophilic thiol would confer major benefits to
early life including high yield and stereoselective peptide synthesis that results in peptides
capable of forming metal complexes and feasibly participate in early metabolism. For example,
cysteines can bind and stabilize redox-active FeS clusters (33), which are present in some of
the most ancient proteins (48). Considering the exceptional benefits of the thiol group, it is
intriguing to note that all modern proteins begin with a sulfur-bearing methionine. Our findings
provide further motivation for investigating the availability of cysteine or related thiolcontaining amino acids on early Earth and whether the presence of such molecules could be a
practically useful biosignature for life elsewhere.

Scourie Mòr pyroxenite was crushed and mesh filtered to less than 106µm. 50g of the resulting
powder was cleaned by washing and drying at 120°C for 2 hours with 2x 50ml 60% ethanol
(Diluted from 100% Stock (Ethanol Absolute VWR chemicals) and 2x 50ml MilliQ H2O across
four heat-drying cycles. After cleaning the pyroxenite was heated for a further 24 hours at
200°C. 0.06g/ml (of reactant) of cleaned sterilized Scourie Mòr pyroxenite was added into to
100ml borosilicate crimp neck vials (VWR, 548-0609) (50ml experiments) or 15ml
polypropylene screw cap tubes (SARSTEDT, 62.554.502) (5ml experiments) to simulate a
mineral/ocean interface near a hydrothermal system. For experiments using different oxide
minerals, spectroscopy pure SiO2, AlO2, MgO2 and FeO2 was added to each reaction vessel as
supplied (Sigma-Aldrich).

20mM total L- or L+D (1:1) MAAM solutions were prepared from crystalline powders as
supplied (>98%, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the following proportions: glycine (0.41), alanine
(0.24), aspartate (0.12), glutamate (0.10), valine (0.04), serine (0.02), isoleucine (0.02), leucine
(0.01), proline (0.03), and threonine (0.01). For experiments using isotopically labelled amino
acids, crystalline L-cysteine (99% 3-13C, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), glycine 15N (98%
15
N, Sigma-Aldrich), L-methionine (13Cmethyl) (Sigma-Aldrich) and L-alanine 15N (98% 15N,
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were used. The amino acid mixtures were dissolved in 0.1M
bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (pH 9.55±0.1) that had been prepared from anhydrous sodium
carbonate (Fisher Scientific) and sodium bicarbonate (ACS grade, Sigma). Once all amino
acids were fully dissolved, 500mM NH4OH was added from a 28-30% NH4OH stock solution
(ACS grade, 28-30% in water, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the pH adjusted with 33% HCl
or 5M NaOH to 9.55±0.1.

20mM stocks of each 'excess' amino acid to be tested (>98%, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
prepared separately in 0.1M bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (pH 9.55±0.1). Solutions contained
20mM Na2S (ACS grade, MP Biomedical) or 20mM TCEP (Fluorochem) prior to mixing to
prevent amino acid oxidation before or after peptide synthesis. The measured redox potential
was typically 90-100mV following synthesis. All solutions were sparged for 20 minutes in N2
followed by a further 30-minute equilibration in a 100% N2 atmosphere (<10 O2 ppm) in a
positive pressure anaerobic hood (COY Laboratory Products).

oxide mineral. The solutions were diluted with 0.1M carbonate buffer (pH 9.55±0.1) to a final
concentration of 5mM MAAM, 5mM TCEP or Na2S, 250mM NH4OH, and 5mM of the excess
amino acid. The reaction vessels were crimp sealed or screw capped and heated at 90°C
(Heratherm OGS100).

Post-reaction samples for TIMS-TOF MS were purified by C18 chromatography prior to
loading. 4ml aliquots of post-reaction sample were lyophilized and resuspended into 400µl of
0.1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA) (Sigma-Aldrich). Separately, C18 SPE tips were prepared by
packing 2µl of C18 resin (Empore SPE C18 48mm 12um particle size) into 10µl micropipette
tips. The resin was activated by washing twice with 60µl of 100% acetonitrile (HPLC grade,
99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 60µl of 0.1% TFA (Sigma-Aldrich) with a 2-minute spin at 4000xg
after each addition. 400µl of sample in 80µl aliquots was then pipetted into each SPE tip with
a 4-minute spin at 5000xg after each addition. The flowthrough was retained, and the column
washed with 60µl of 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted in 160µl of 60% acetonitrile in 80µl
aliquots. Elution fractions were lyophilized and stored at 4°C prior to analysis.

Post-reaction samples in 0.1M carbonate at pH 9.5 were diluted 1 in 20 with 0.1M carbonate
buffer at pH 9.5 (prepared as described above) to 200µl. 200µl of the diluted aliquots were
added to an HellmaAnalytics High Precision Quartz SUPRASIL UV-Vis cell (light path
10x2mm) and were scanned at wavelengths of 200-800nm in a Cary 50 Bio UV-Visible
Spectrophotometer with a scan rate of 4800.000nm/min and 1.0nm data intervals in dual beam
mode with a baseline correction against a 0.1M carbonate pH 9.5 solution. Three technical
repeats were recorded for each sample and the mean reported as a single biological repeat for
comparison between synthesis runs. The UV-Vis cell was cleaned between samples with 1ml
of 2% Hellmanex III (Sigma Aldrich) and thoroughly rinsed with Milli-Q water between each
experiment and dried with N2 gas. Biological repeats were normalized relative to L-alanine.
Results were exported with the absorbance at 230.04nm plotted for each experiment using
GraphPad Prism Software. For measurement of rates of apparent peptide bond formation,
concentrations were estimated using 10mM dialanine (A230 = 0.45) as an internal calibration
standard.

TIMS-TOF MS was conducted on purified peptide solutions following C18 SPE purification
(described above). 1µl of purified peptides in 0.1% FA was injected onto a Bruker nanoElute
HPLC equipped with a ThermoTrap Cartridge Guard Column (Thermo Scientific 160454) and
a Bruker PepSep Fifteen elution column operating at 50°C (Bruker, 1893473). Peptides were
eluted on to a Bruker timsTOF Pro 2 Mass spectrometer by gradient elution at a flow rate of
0.55ul/min (Buffer A - 0.1% FA, Buffer B – 100%ACN 0.1% FA) on a 30 minute 0-40% ACN
gradient). Detections were analyzed within the Bruker Direct Analysis software. Peak lists were
analyzed using a python script (written in house, and available on request) which compared
exported mass detections to a list of every amino acid combination of peptides up to 20 amino
acids long, and candidate peptides with >5ppm deviation in mass were discarded. For
detections where multiple sequence combinations were possible, the identification with the

Lyophilized crude or C18 SPE purified post-reaction solutions (1mL original volume) were
resuspended into 200µl of water with 5% D2O and 0.4mM DSS (Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories) at pH 5.5 or in 99.9% D2O (Sigma-Aldrich) with 5mM benzoic acid (ACS grade
99.5%, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.4mM DSS (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at pH
5.5. The resulting 5x concentration solutions were loaded into 3mm Bruker SampleJet NMR
tubes. NMR data were recorded in magnets operating at 17.6 or 22.3 Tesla (Oxford Instruments
magnets) and equipped with high sensitivity 5mm TCI cryoprobes and Avance III HD consoles
(Bruker). 2D 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra were acquired
with 64 scans, and the total points and sweep widths were 1274 and 320, and 11.934ppm and
65.00ppm, for 1H and 13C, respectively. 2D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) data were
acquired with 128 scans, sweep widths of 10.000ppm, and total points of 2048 and 320 in the
direct and indirect 1H dimensions, respectively. qNMR to measure depletion of monomeric
amino acids was performed by integrating and comparing the 1Hα signals from monomeric
amino acids before and after reaction. The integrated triplet signal of benzoic acid centered at
7.403ppm at 20˚C was used as an internal standard to enable quantitative comparison between
experimental runs. The results were analyzed with TopSpin 4.3.0.

SiO2/amino acid complexes were prepared using the approach of Lopes et al.(44) Solid amino
acid/SiO2 samples were prepared in a 100% N2 gas atmosphere (<10ppm O2) to eliminate the
requirement for reducing agents during the mixing stage. 500mM solutions of L- or D-cysteine
were prepared by dissolution of crystalline cysteine (>99%; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in MilliQ water, the pH was adjusted to 1.5 or 10.5 using 33% HCl or 5M NaOH. For each reaction,
3.0g of SiO2 (Specpure, Alfa Aesar) was weighed out and placed into a 50ml polypropylene
tube (Sarstedt). Amino acid solutions were added to the SiO2 powder and the tubes screwedcapped. The samples were stirred with a magnetic stir bar for 48 hours at 23°C.

Following mixing, the solutions were vacuum pump filtered through a 0.22µm PES membrane
(MilliPore) to remove free amino acids. The SiO2 solid left on the disk was gently washed and
filtered three times with 30ml of 0.1M carbonate at pH 10.5 or pH 1.5. Following washing, the
SiO2 solid was scraped from the membrane and put into a 50ml polypropylene tube and
lyophilized prior to storage at -80°C before analysis.

Ti/Au/SiO2 microfilm slides mounted on a standard glass slide were prepared at the Thin Film
Facility in the Department of Physics, University of Oxford. Glass microscope slides were
cleaned prior to coating with Decon 90 and rinsed with deionized water, acetone and IPA.
Slides were loaded into a Leybold L560 and cleaned by Argon glow discharge for 10 minutes
(6x10-2 mbar). Ti was evaporated using an e-beam (4x10-5 mbar) and deposited at a rate of
0.3nm/s to a final thickness of 2nm. Au was evaporated by thermal evaporation at (2x10-5 mbar)
and deposited at a rate of 0.5nm/s to 10nm thickness. Finally, SiO2 was evaporated using an
ebeam (2.2x10-5 mbar) and deposited at a rate of 0.25nm/s to a thickness of 10nm. Following
preparation, the slides were moved to an anaerobic hood and placed at the base of a
polypropylene container. Separately, 25mM solutions of D- and L-aspartate and solutions of
50mM D- and L-cysteine and D-and L-alanine were made up in Milli-Q water under a 100%
N2 atmosphere. Solution pH was adjusted to 10.0 using 5M NaOH and each added to a
container with a Ti/Au/SiO2 slide. The set up was incubated for 36 hours at room temperature.
Following incubation, the slides were removed and washed using 20ml of pH 10.00 degassed
Milli-Q water before being dried at room temperature prior to analysis. PR-IRRAS spectra for
the Ti/Au/SiO2 amino acid complexes were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 80 FT-IR spectrometer
equipped with a liquid N2 cooled MCT detector and a Pike VeeMax accessory. The
spectrometer was referenced to a blank Ti/Au/SiO2 slide, and the samples were assessed with
s-polarized and p polarized beams at incidence angles of 30˚, 60˚ and 80˚. Absolute reflectance
of p polarized beams was plotted using GraphPad Prism software.

Figure 1: Cysteine stereo-specifically increases peptide yield in the presence of an achiral oxide
mineral. (a) Detection of peptide bond formation by absorbance at 230nm (A230) after 48 hours of
heating in borosilicate reaction vessels with MAAM plus an excess of L-cysteine (n=6), D-cysteine
(n=5), L-alanine (n=6), D-alanine (n=3), or L-methionine (n=2). Biological repeats were normalised to
the A230 with L-alanine. Normalisation relative to L-cysteine was used to determine the standard
error of the mean (SEM; error bars) of L-alanine biological repeats. The mean control absorbance of
L-alanine, D-alanine and L-methionine was 2.10. Significance was determined by one way ANOVA
with Tukey post-hoc analysis of absorbance vs L-alanine (L-cysteine, p=<0.0001; D-cysteine, p=0.085;
D-alanine, p=0.712; L-methionine, p=0.702) (Table S1). (b) A230 amino acid mixtures reacted in
polypropylene reaction vessels with 5 mM L-cysteine, 5 mM MAAM and 0.5g pyroxene (L-cys, w/
pyr.; n=3), 5mM L-cysteine, 5mM MAAM, and no pyroxene (L-cys, no pyr.; n=3), and 10 mM MAAM
with no L-cysteine or pyroxene (MAAM only, no pyr.; n=1). For the comparison of reactions
containing L-cysteine and with or without pyroxene, p=0.0015 (two-tailed unpaired t-test) (Table
S2). Error bars indicate SEM. (c) Loss of monomeric amino acid reactant by Quantitative NMR with
a benzoic acid internal standard after 48 hours of reaction time. Error bars display standard
deviation of the benzoic acid signal height at 7.4034ppm. (d) A230 measurement of stereoselective
peptide bond formation following reactions at lower (55µM) amino acid starting concentrations.
Reactions were heated at 90˚C for 42 days in borosilicate reaction vessels. Error bars indicate the
standard deviation for technical repeats (n=3). (e) 2D 1H-1H TOCSY spectrum of a post-reaction
mixture enriched in L-cysteine. The spectral region corresponds to intra-residue correlations between
amide protons (1HN) and either 1Hα (~4.0 – 4.7ppm) or sidechain protons (~1.0 – 4.0 ppm).

Overlay of 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectra of reactions containing 13Cβ-labelled L-cysteine before (black)
and after (blue) reaction. New crosspeaks in the post-reaction spectrum are attributed to
incorporation of 13Cβ-labelled L-cysteine into peptides adjacent to different amino acid types.
Additional crosspeaks arise from natural abundance 13C (1.1%). (b) Overlay of 2D 1H-1H TOCSY
spectra of reaction mixtures containing L-cysteine before (black) and after (orange) reaction. The
intense cysteine monomer 1Hα-1Hβ crosspeaks observed before reaction are indicated by lines. The
large number of new post-reaction crosspeaks are attributed to unique peptide species. (c)
Histogram of the total number of unique peptide products in L-cysteine reactions identified by
TIMS-TOF MS after purification by SPE and HPLC prior to MS loading.

Figure 3: D-cysteine and L-cysteine association with silicates is bivalent at alkaline pH. (a) Overlay
of solid-state NMR 13C cross polarisation spectra of L-cysteine (blue) and D-cysteine (purple)
absorbed to silicate at pH 10.5. The 13C resonances are indicated by colored circles for L-cysteine
(closed) and D-cysteine (open). Chemical shift positions of the enantiomers are similar for
carboxylate 13C’ signals and differ for the 13Cα and 13Cβ signals. Wash buffer signals at 163.2ppm
(bicarbonate), 169.3ppm (carbonate) 179.7ppm (carbonate salt), and 63.7ppm (bicarbonate
sideband) are indicated (*). (b) Solid-state NMR 13C cross polarisation spectra of L-cysteine absorbed
to silicates at pH 10.5 (blue) and pH 1.5 (yellow). The 13Cβ signals are independent of pH, whereas
the 13Cα and carboxylate 13C’ signals are perturbed at low pH consistent with de/protonation of the
carboxylate. (c) 13C chemical shifts determined from solid-state spectra. Asterisks indicate the
observed chemical shifts consistent with covalent thiolate attachment42.
