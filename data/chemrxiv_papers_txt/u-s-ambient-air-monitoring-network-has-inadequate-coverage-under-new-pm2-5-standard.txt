Abstract

9

The Clean Air Act (CAA) in the United States relies heavily on regulatory monitoring networks,

10

yet monitoring sites are sparsely located, especially among historically disadvantaged

11

communities. For ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), we compare the air quality monitoring

12

data with spatially complete concentrations derived from empirical models to quantify the gaps

13

of existing U.S. monitoring networks in capturing concentration hotspots and exposure

14

disparities. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted a more stringent

15

annual-average air quality standard for PM2.5 (9 µg/m3). Here, we demonstrate that 44% of urban

16

areas exceeding this new standard – encompassing ~ 20 million people – would remain

17

undetected because of gaps in the current PM2.5 monitoring network. Crucially, we find that

18

“uncaptured” hotspots, which contain 2.8 million people in census tracts that are misclassified as

19

in attainment of the new PM2.5 standard, have substantially higher percentages of minority

20

populations (i.e., people of color, disadvantaged communities, and low-income populations)

21

compared to the overall US population. To address these gaps, we highlight 10 priority locations

22

that could reduce the population in the uncaptured hotspots by 67%. Overall, our findings

23

highlight the urgent need to address gaps in the existing monitoring network.

Introduction

28

Ambient air pollution causes hundreds of billions of dollars in health damages per year in the

29

United States, driven principally by the health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These

30

exposures and health burdens disproportionately affect people of color (POC) and low-income

31

populations.1–3 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), implementing the Clean Air

32

Act (CAA) over the past five decades, has dramatically reduced exposures to criteria air

33

pollutants for hundreds of millions of Americans, yielding enormous health benefits.4

34

Nonetheless, we don’t all breathe the same air, and major disparities in exposure remain.2,5–8

35

The CAA relies on State and Local Air Monitoring Station (SLAMS) networks for determining

36

hotspots and background concentrations, the health and welfare impacts of air pollution, and

37

compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (see Supporting

38

Information [SI], Section 1)9. However, due to the high capital and operational cost of

39

monitoring stations, the existing SLAMS network is sparsely located across the US, often

40

missing localized concentration variations10,11 and causing millions of high-exposure populations

41

to be undetected and unprotected by the monitors.12–14

42

Moreover, there are disproportionately fewer monitoring sites in communities with higher

43

shares of POC and low-income people.14–17 While new measurement approaches such as low-

44

cost sensors and mobile monitoring have made denser monitoring networks and high-resolution

45

concentration surfaces feasible,18–21 such data are still unevenly distributed among those

46

communities22–24 and have not been incorporated in the NAAQS nonattainment process.

47

On February 7, 2024, EPA revised the annual primary standard for PM2.5, from 12 µg/m3 to 9

48

µg/m3.25 At present, EPA is modifying the PM2.5 monitoring network design to include an

49

environmental justice factor25 and is distributing tens of millions of dollars for enhancing

50

monitoring in overburdened communities.26,27 However, limited scientific knowledge exists

51

regarding: 1) the effectiveness of the existing monitoring networks under the new standard and

52

2) how to address the monitoring gaps. Here, we quantify gaps in the SLAMS network’s ability

53

to detect concentration hotspots under the new PM2.5 standard, particularly for minority

54

populations. We also evaluate approaches for adding monitoring sites to address these gaps. We

55

find that the existing SLAMS are inadequate for capturing concentration hotspots and

56

disparities. Adding monitors can improve the representation of concentration hotspots, but not

57

concentration disparities. This study provides the first quantification of the monitoring gaps

58

under the new and future decreasing standards and informs policies for addressing the

59

monitoring gaps.

Materials and Methods

61

Air pollution data and attainment status definition

62

The U.S. EPA uses ambient measurements from SLAMS to determine whether a specific

63

geographical area is in attainment of the NAAQS. Attainment here is assessed for Core-Based

64

Statistical Areas (CBSAs), which each correspond to one or more adjoining counties that

65

encompass a large urban area or population nucleus. We employ CBSAs because they are

66

usually used for determining area-wide air quality levels and planning new monitors (see SI

67

Section S1).9 There are 894 CBSAs in the contiguous U.S., home to 320 million people: 379

68

metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; population ≥ 50,000) and 515 micropolitan statistical areas

69

(μSAs; population 10,000-49,999).

70

To investigate whether SLAMS are potentially missing areas of elevated PM2.5 in excess of the

71

NAAQS, we employ a spatially complete dataset of census-tract level PM2.5 estimates for the

72

contiguous U.S. from the empirical model of the Center for Air, Climate and Energy Solutions

73

(CACES, www.caces.us),28,29 building on partial least squares regressions with universal kriging

74

framework. For the model years we consider here (2017-2019), the predictions have high-

75

fidelity to out-of-sample validation measurements (R2: 0.77-0.83; standardized root mean square

76

error: 14%-16%).29 We compute three-year averaged tract-level concentrations from the annual

77

model predictions to match EPA’s design values (three-year averaged measurements)30 and

78

further reduce the influence of model uncertainties and extreme events (see SI Section S2).

79

Next, we obtain the design values and geographical coordinates of the 2017-2019 active PM2.5

80

monitoring sites (n = 988) from the EPA’s Air Quality System and match them with CACES

81

predictions (Figure S1). To further validate the empirical model, we check if model predictions

82

correctly classify monitoring sites exceeding 9 µg/m3 NAAQS (Figure S2). The model’s low

83

bias makes our conclusions slightly conservative in identifying exceeding tracts. As sensitivity

84

tests, we separately employ years 2017, 2018, and 2019 from CACES, and an alternative dataset

85

of remotely-sensed 0.01° × 0.01° resolution (~1.1 km) PM2.5 predictions (see SI Section S2).31

86

For each CBSA, we compare PM2.5 model predictions at monitoring sites with PM2.5

87

distributions for all census tracts. EPA determines a CBSA as “nonattainment” if any SLAMS

88

monitors’ design values exceed the NAAQS. We adapt this by defining nonattainment as having

89

three or more tracts within a CBSA exceeding the standard, allowing us to focus on areas with

90

elevated concentrations that likely affect thousands of people, rather than small-location

91

hotspots. As sensitivity tests, we employ alternative nonattainment definitions (see SI Section

92

2). Finally, we classify nonattainment CBSAs by whether the PM2.5 estimates at monitoring

93

locations exceed the NAAQS (see Table S1). CBSAs are considered to be “captured” if they are

94

correctly identified as nonattainment by monitoring locations; and “uncaptured” if they are

95

misclassified as in attainment by monitoring locations, but have other unmonitored hotspots

96

exceeding the NAAQS. Uncaptured CBSAs are of special concern here. As another sensitivity

97

test, we evaluate nonattainment at the county level (see SI Section S2).

98

Demographic data and exposure disparities

99

We consider three demographic groupings: (1) race-ethnicity, (2) disadvantaged community

100

(DAC) status, and (3) median household income, all by Census Tract for 2020. The five racial-

101

ethnic groups based on US Census data are: non-Hispanic White (58%; “White”), Latino or

102

Hispanic (19%; “Hispanic”), non-Hispanic Black or African American (12%; “Black”), non-

103

Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander (5%; “Asian”), and American Indian, another race, or

104

multiracial (3%; “Other”). All except non-Hispanic White are grouped as People of Color

105

(POC).

106

Second, DACs are defined by combining six publicly available national screening tools from the

107

federal government (see SI Section S3; Table S2). We identify a census tract as DAC if it

108

surpasses the specified thresholds by three or more tools (~25% of the total US population;

109

Figures S3-S6). The reasons for combining six tools are to avoid the ineffectiveness or

110

uncertainty in any single tool32 and to highlight locations of highest concern or federal funding.

111

Third, median household income is from the 2020 American Community Survey. We classify

112

income into tertiles: high (> $76,164), middle ($51,168 - $76,164), and low (<$51,168).

113

We calculate PM2.5 exposure disparities by race-ethnicity, DAC status, and household income,

114

respectively, as the population-weighted average concentration for POC, DAC, and low-income

115

populations, minus the overall population-average concentration. Disparities are calculated for

116

all census tracts and tracts near monitors (n = 4,360; defined here as centroids within 1-km buffer

117

of a monitoring site).

Figure 1. Core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) exceed a hypothetical PM2.5 standard,
classified by monitoring status. Here, we consider only those CBSAs with three or more
census tracts that have modeled PM2.5 exceeding a range of hypothetical PM2.5 standards,
which we thereby consider to be in nonattainment. We classify the (a) number and (b)
percentage of CBSAs exceeding the PM2.5 standard into three distinct groups. In blue, we
present “captured” CBSAs. These CBSAs are correctly identified as exceeding the standard, by
virtue of having monitors located in tracts that exceed the standard. In orange, we present
“uncaptured CBSAs,” which would be misclassified as in attainment based on present
monitoring locations. In these uncaptured CBSAs, the highest monitored tract does not exceed
the standard, despite other unmonitored hotspot tracts exceeding the standard. Finally in red,
we show CBSAs that exceed a given standard value and have no monitors at all. There are no
red or orange bars in (a) and (b) when the standard is set at 11 µg/m³, as the highest
concentrations in all nonattainment CBSAs fall between 11 and 12 µg/m³. Therefore, with a
standard of 11 µg/m³, there are no “uncaptured” or “unmonitored” CBSAs (see Figure S8 for
details). In (c), we illustrate the geographic distribution of CBSAs for the new PM2.5 NAAQS of 9
µg/m3.

The median number of PM2.5 monitoring stations in an MSA is 1 (µSA: 0) (population-weighted

139

median: 5 [MSA], 1 [µSA]; Figure S7). On average, there is one site per 250,000 people. For

140

NAAQS attainment status, the results reveal that 89 CBSAs (total population: 107 million)

141

exceed the new PM2.5 standard (9 µg/m3) (Figure 1a). Among the nonattainment CBSAs, 44%

142

(n=39; 20 million people) are not captured by monitoring (Figures 1b and S8), because the

143

CBSA has either no monitoring stations or the existing locations fail to capture the concentration

144

hotspots (see Figure S9 for case studies). Most uncaptured nonattainment CBSAs are in the

145

Midwest and South (Figure 1c). The estimations of monitoring gaps are robust considering

146

model errors, using alternative nonattainment definitions, separate years, alternative

147

concentration data, and at the county level (see SI Section S2; Figures S10-S13; Table S3).

148

Under future decreasing standards (e.g., to the World Health Organization guideline, 5 µg/m3),

149

~60% of nonattainment CBSAs would not be captured by existing monitors (Figure 1b).

Instead of considering the whole CBSAs (Figure 1), this figure considers the census tracts
themselves. If one high-exposure census tract (≥ 9 µg/m3) is in the captured CBSAs (blue colors
in Figure 1 c), then the tract is defined as captured; otherwise, the high-exposure census tract is
defined as uncaptured. Left panel: tract-level racial-ethnic composition (White, Hispanic, Black,

across the concentration range (3-15 µg/m3). The new standard (9 µg/m3) is represented as
black dashed lines. The uncaptured high-exposure tracts (≥ 9 µg/m3) are represented by the
orange shadow (bottom-left panel). Right panel: racial-ethnic composition for (i) overall census
tracts; (ii) census tracts with concentrations < 9 µg/m3; (iii) census tracts with concentrations ≥ 9
µg/m3 and located in nonattainment CBSAs that are captured by monitors (blue color in Figure
1c); (iv) census tracts with concentrations ≥ 9 µg/m3 and not in the captured nonattainment
CBSAs. There are three reasons for non capturing: the census tracts are in nonattainment
CBSAs that are uncaptured by monitors (orange and red colors in Figure 1c); the CBSAs where
the census tracts are located don’t have three or more census tracts exceeding the standard; or
the census tracts are rural tracts (not within any CBSAs). The latter two reasons include highexposure tracts that are not located in the blue-, orange-, or red-colored CBSAs in Figure 1c.

168
169

Considering only the census tracts exceeding 9 µg/m3 PM2.5 (i.e., only the tracts themselves,

170

rather than the whole CBSAs; “hotspot” tracts), 44 million people (14% of the U.S. population)

171

live in exceeding tracts, of which most (41 million) live in tracts captured by monitors, and the

172

rest (2.8 million) live in tracts not captured by monitors (Figures 2 and S14). The average

173

concentration in the captured hotspots (10.2 µg/m3) is higher than the uncaptured hotspots (9.2

174

µg/m3). Crucially, both captured and uncaptured hotspots contain higher percentages of POC

175

(68% and 50%, respectively) compared to the overall population (42%) (Figure 2). Those

176

hotspots also contain higher percentages of DAC (42% and 41%) and low-income populations

177

(28% and 39%) than the overall population (25% [DAC]; 28% [low-income]; Figures S15-S16).

178

Minority population percentages in the uncaptured hotspots are higher than the state average in

179

most states (Figure S17). This suggests that the existing monitors are insufficient to identify

180

concentration hotspots, disproportionately impacting minority populations. According to the

181

Code of Federal Regulations,9 regulatory monitors primarily focus on area-wide air quality, not

182

concentration hotspots. However, the EPA is planning new monitors in at-risk communities,

183

including minority communities, to capture source impacts (see SI Section S1). Our results

184

indicate that new monitors are essential for detecting hotspots in those communities.

185

We also examine whether monitoring locations represent exposure hotspots, average exposure

186

levels, and disparities by demographic group. On average, 23% of the overall population lives in

187

census tracts with higher concentrations than the highest monitored concentrations in the
7

188

CBSAs. However, for POC, DAC, and low-income populations, the numbers are 32%, 39% and

189

36%, respectively, indicating that monitoring is less representative of the upper bounds of the

190

population-concentration distribution for these minority groups (Figure 3a). Comparing the

191

concentration disparities for all census tracts and tracts around monitors, monitored locations

192

underestimate state-level disparities in most states (Figures 3b-3c, S18-S19). For example, the

193

national racial-ethnic relative disparity of PM2.5 concentration is 6.1% for all tracts; the relative

194

disparity for tracts around monitors is only 4.3% (a 30% underestimation).

207
208

Lastly, we examine approaches for addressing these monitoring gaps and disparities (see SI

209

Section S4), consistent with recent federal and state legislation supporting enhanced monitoring

210

for DACs.33,34 Here, we present an approach for prioritizing new monitor locations, following a

211

simple scheme that identifies optimal census tracts for monitoring based on the size of the

212

additional population in census tracts that would be newly captured (i.e., correctly reclassified as

213

nonattainment) through the addition of a marginal monitoring site (see SI for full details). Our

214

results imply that adding only 10 new monitor locations could reduce the population in the

215

uncaptured hotspots by 67% (from 2.8 million to 0.9 million; Figure 4). This approach would

216

reduce the percentage of POC population in uncaptured hotspots by 20% (from 50% to 40%;

217

Figure S20), but would provide less benefit to DAC and low-income populations (see Figures

218

S20-S22 for other approaches, which might better target those subpopulations). Nonetheless,

219

although adding a small number of targeted monitor locations could sharply reduce the number

220

of people “uncaptured” by the existing monitoring network, it would not meaningfully improve

221

the ability of the SLAMS to characterize nationwide PM2.5 disparities (Figure S23). To

222

accurately evaluate exposure disparities, other methods or tools (instead of regulatory

223

monitoring), with much finer spatial resolution, are likely needed.

CBSAs with the highest number of people residing in uncaptured census tracts (10 red
locations), and adding one additional appropriately-sited monitor to each CBSA, the population
remaining in uncaptured hotspots would be reduced by 67% to 0.9 million people. The addition
of these monitors would result in each of these 10 CBSAs (total population = 13 million) being
classified as in non-attainment of the new PM2.5 NAAQS based on the 2017-2019 design
value. Note that after all hotspots in the CBSAs are captured, there remains a non-urban highexposure population of ~ 0.2 million people that is located outside of the CBSAs.

234
235

Implications for future policy

236

Our study comprehensively quantifies gaps and disparities in the existing regulatory monitoring

237

networks, revealing the following key points. First, the existing SLAMS regulatory monitoring

238

network fails to capture 44% of nonattainment CBSA under the new PM2.5 NAAQS, providing

239

inadequate protection to tens of millions of highly-exposed people. These uncaptured

240

populations are higher than previously documented under the old PM2.5 standards,12–14

241

highlighting the urgent need for additional monitors to implement the new standard effectively.

242

Second, existing monitoring networks have disproportionately less coverage among the high-

243

exposure minority populations. Those populations are already more vulnerable and sensitive to

244

the health effects from air pollution.35,36 Our findings indicate that adding a small number of

245

additional monitors can noticeably reduce the number of unmonitored exceeding locations; that

246

step will benefit the overall population and help reduce injustices via State Implementation

247

Plans.

248

Third, the monitoring stations underestimate exposure disparities. Unfortunately, adding a

249

moderate number of monitors would be ineffective at addressing this gap (Figure S23). Indeed,

250

since empirical models may underestimate hotspot concentrations,2,37 the true underestimation in

251

disparities by the monitoring networks is likely to be even greater than is estimated here. Our

252

results imply that other technologies and tools with higher spatial resolution, such as mobile

253

monitoring,37–40 well-calibrated low-cost or portable sensors,22–24,41–44 and satellite-based

254

models,45–49 could aid in representing exposure hotspots and disparities. Those tools may also be

255

useful for nonattainment designation. Thus, an important open question is whether new
10

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-9j3xl-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3266-1367 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

256

data/tools need to be incorporated into the CAA policies (e.g., for identifying at-risk

257

communities, planning new monitors, and determining attainment/nonattainment status).

258

Our study informs the implementation of the new PM2.5 NAAQS, in terms of regulatory

259

monitoring. Our findings reveal that as the “umbrella” to protect the US population, the existing

260

PM2.5 SLAMS network has consequential monitoring gaps. Effective and straightforward

261

solutions exist (i.e., adding a small number of monitors) to address the monitoring gaps

262

identified here. Doing so would protect the overall population, but would not substantially

263

change the underestimation of disparities by the monitoring network. Our results use 2017-2019

264

data, while EPA’s nonattainment designations will rely on post-November 2024 measurements.

265

However, air quality trends have been broadly steady since 2016 (Figure S24), suggesting our

266

findings offer insight into near-future attainment status, though actual concentrations may differ.

267

Previous research indicated that simply tightening NAAQS standards without targeting specific

268

locations will not address disparities.8,32 Therefore, improvement in monitoring networks,

269

incorporating other high-resolution tools, and more effective location-based strategies are all

270

urgently needed, in addition to stricter NAAQS standards, to address exposure disparities. Future

271

studies could further investigate state-level solutions for reducing pollution levels, eliminating

272

disparities, and designing monitoring networks to support both goals. Our methodologies for

273

investigating monitoring gaps may apply to other pollutants (e.g., nitrogen dioxide).
