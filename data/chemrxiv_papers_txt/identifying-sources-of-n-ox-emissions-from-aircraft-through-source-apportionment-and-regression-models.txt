Abstract

17

Air quality managers in areas exceeding air pollution standards are motivated to understand where there

18

are further opportunities to reduce NOx emissions to improve ozone and PM2.5 air quality. In this project,

19

we use a combination of aircraft remote sensing (i.e., GCAS), source apportionment models (i.e., CAMx),

20

and regression models to investigate NOx emissions from individual source-sectors in Houston, TX. In prior

21

work, GCAS column NO2 was shown to be close to the “truth” in validating column NO2 in model

22

simulations. Column NO2 from CAMx was substantially low biased compared to Pandora (–20%) and

23

GCAS measurements (–31%), suggesting an underestimate of local NOx emissions. We applied a flux

24

divergence method to the GCAS and CAMx data to distinguish the linear shape of major highways and

25

identify NO2 underestimates at highway locations. Using a multiple linear regression model, we isolated

26

on-road, railyard, and “other” NOx emissions as the likeliest cause of this low bias, and simultaneously

27

identified a potential overestimate of shipping NOx emissions. We modified on-road and shipping NOX

28

emissions in a new CAMx simulation and increased the background NO2, and better agreement was found

29

with GCAS measurements: bias improved from –31% to –10% and r2 improved from 0.78 to 0.80. This

30

study outlines how remote sensing data, including fine spatial information from newer instruments such as

31

TEMPO, can be used in concert with chemical transport models to provide actionable information for air

32

quality managers to identify further opportunities to reduce NOx emissions.

Introduction

34

Nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions are directly harmful to human health and a critical participant

35

in ozone formation. Many North American cities already have NOx-limited ozone formation during the

36

warm season1–3, and the remaining cities should have primarily NOx-limited conditions in the coming years4.

37

Further reducing ozone pollution in metropolitan areas will therefore require improved quantification of

38

NOx emissions. Exposure to NOx is also directly associated with asthma exacerbation in vulnerable

39

groups5,6 and premature death7,8. One major limitation of our current observing network is the inability to

40

accurately quantify NOx emissions on a sector-by-sector basis in a timely fashion, with the exception of

41

continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) on electricity generating units. Additionally, many non-

42

road sources of NOx emissions, such as industrial or construction emissions, have large uncertainties9.

43

Typically, air pollutant emission rates for chemical species such as NOx are estimated using a “bottom-up”

44

approach, which uses fuel consumption information, spatial surrogates (e.g., road density, population

45

density, locations of known stack emissions), temporal surrogates (e.g., traffic patterns, industrial work

46

schedules) and emission factors (mass of pollutant per mass of fuel burned) to estimate the spatiotemporal

47

patterns of emissions across regions10,11. With investments in technology to better understand the

48

spatiotemporal patterns of pollutants (e.g. incorporating real-time traffic data using speed and type of

49

vehicle) and laboratory studies to better estimate the emission factors in a wide range of conditions, these

50

“bottom-up” estimates can be improved12. These new and improved estimates can then be incorporated into

51

a chemical transport model and evaluated against observations from ground monitors. Based on this

52

comparison, the emission estimates can be further adjusted and improved if necessary. However, given the

53

complexity of this cycle, “bottom-up” emission estimates typically take many years to compile by a large

54

team of scientists, and subsequently, are delayed in time by several years from the actual emission time.

55

A complementary method to estimate air pollutant emissions is in using a “top-down” approach. With this

56

method, emissions are back calculated from pollutant measurements acquired across an entire airshed. This

57

is typically done with a remote sensing instrument – in orbit13–15 or on an aircraft16–18. Analyses have been

58

conducted for global megacities19–23 and power plants24,25 using the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument

59

(TROPOMI) and a complementary satellite instrument, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The

60

emission rates are inferred by analyzing the concentration maps over a large region and incorporating the

61

lifetime (chemical and dispersion lifetime) of the pollutant to back-calculate the emission rate at the source.

62

The advantage of a “top-down” technique is that it is independent of the complex datasets needed to

63

estimate “bottom-up” emissions rates. Typically these aggregated “top-down” estimates agree with the

64

“bottom-up” estimates within 40% in North American cities (well within the uncertainty associated with

65

the ‘top-down’ method)13,26. Given TROPOMI’s spatial resolution (3.5 × 5.5 km2 at nadir) and temporal

66

resolution (once daily), TROPOMI is most often used to calculate total emissions aggregated over the entire

67

metropolitan area and seasonal/annual timescales, and assumptions are needed to infer emissions rate

68

during morning and evening hours. Therefore, very limited, if any, sectoral or hourly information can be

69

gleaned from an analysis using polar-orbiting satellite datasets, such as TROPOMI.

70

In this project we used fine spatial resolution nitrogen dioxide (NO2) information (250 × 560 m2) from the

71

Geostationary Coastal and air pollution events Airborne Simulator (GCAS) instrument27,28, available during

72

the September 2021 NASA/TCEQ Tracking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment – Air Quality (TRACER-

73

AQ) field campaign29, to better understand the fine-scale structure of NOx emissions in the Houston

74

metropolitan area including a sector-by-sector analysis. Complementing the airborne observations, we

75

perform a simulation using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) at fine spatial

76

resolution (444 × 444 m2). The model output has already been compared to data from GCAS and TROPOMI

77

in a complementary paper30. In this project, we push further by using source-tagged NO2 information from

78

CAMx and GCAS data to estimate more accurate contributions from different NOx emission sectors. We

79

do this by using flux divergence methods on the GCAS data and by training a multiple linear regression

80

model to the airborne retrievals, with the CAMx source-tagged NO2 as the independent variables.

Methods

82

GCAS. The GCAS instrument was installed on the NASA G-V aircraft during the Tracking Aerosol

83

Convection. ExpeRiment – Air Quality (TRACER-AQ) field campaign in Houston, Texas during

84

September 2021. The GCAS instrument employs charge-coupled device array detectors to observe

85

backscattered light. These data can be used to calculate column densities of gases, such as NO2, below the

86

aircraft using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS)31.

87

During TRACER-AQ, GCAS collected data over the Houston metropolitan area across 12 days during late

88

August and throughout September 2021. The flight strategy of the aircraft included flying the plane in a

89

‘lawnmower’ fashion with flight lines spaced 6.3 km apart, ensuring overlap at flight altitude (28,000 feet)

90

with the instrument field of view of 45 degrees creating one gapless map of NO2 up to three times per flight

91

day. GCAS has a native pixel resolution of approximately 250 m × 250 m at flight altitude. Observations

92

from two of the flight days – a test flight (August 30) and a flight over the Gulf of Mexico (September 27)

93

are excluded from this study because they provided no meaningful data over Houston. Given the relatively

94

short timeframe of flight data collection; meteorological conditions have an influence on the fine-scale

95

patterns in NO2 columns observations.

96

Air mass factors use modeled scattering weights and vertical profile information to account for altitude-

97

dependent sensitivities in remote-sensing observations32,33. The original vertical profiles in the dataset were

98

derived from a global model, GEOS-CF34, that had a coarser spatial resolution (0.25° × 0.25°), but in this

99

study we only show GCAS column NO2 measurements processed with vertical profile information from

100

CAMx. To directly compare GCAS measurements to the CAMx NO2 column concentrations we re-grid

101

them to the fine-scale WRF-CAMx grid. Only cloud-free GCAS data is considered in this analysis. An

102

example of daily and monthly averaged GCAS data is shown in Figure 1. The differences in these two

103

timescales highlights the complexity of NO2 variance in cities, such as Houston. Diurnal column NO2

104

patterns are shown in Figure S1.

Pandora. Observations from three Pandora monitoring sites were available during the TRACER-AQ field

111

campaign to validate the GCAS, satellite, and model column NO2 measurements. Critical to this project,

112

we found in previous work30 that the GCAS measurements of column NO2 during the TRACER-AQ

113

campaign had an excellent correlation (r2 = 0.79) and minimal normalized mean bias (NMB = +3.4%) when

114

compared to measurements of the same quantity from Pandora instruments, suggesting that the GCAS

115

measurements acquired during the TRACER-AQ campaign are very close to the “truth”. The Pandora

116

instruments were located in the suburban and urban neighborhoods.

117

WRF-CAMx simulation. For this study, a set of simulations were conducted employing version 4.3.3

118

of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model35 jointly with the

119

Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) v7.2036 with the CB6r5 chemical mechanism

120

for a simulation period that matched the September 2021 TRACER-AQ domain and timeframe. The

121

36/12/4/1.33/0.444 km model domains can be seen in Figure S2. Prior work evaluated this WRF simulation

122

and found minimal systematic biases in surface-level wind speed, direction, temperature, and water vapor

123

mixing ratio compared to observations from sixteen ground-level monitors30. A longer description of the

124

WRF-CAMx model options is included in the supplemental including the WRF physics options (Table S1),

125

vertical layer mapping from WRF to CAMx (Table S2), and CAMx science options (Table S3). For

126

emissions in CAMx, we start with an emissions inventory developed by the TCEQ for the Dallas-Fort

127

Worth (DFW) and Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) Attainment Demonstration (AD) SIP revisions and

128

implement further minor changes as discussed in the Supplemental.

129

Source Apportionment. We used the CAMx OSAT source apportionment tool to track NO2 from several

130

emission source sectors as listed in Table S4. To select individual electric generating units (EGUs) in our

131

0.444 km CAMx domain for NO2 tracking we used a threshold of 0.8 tons per day of NOx emissions. This

132

threshold identified nine EGUs shown in the first nine rows of Table S4. We also selected on-road mobile,

133

railyards, shipping and the George Bush Intercontinental (KIAH) and William P. Hobby (KHOU) airports

134

for NO2 tracking. All remaining NOx emissions were tracked together in the “other” category. Relevant for

135

this project, average weekday NOx emissions for the 0.444 m domain were 372.9 tons per day (123 Gg/yr).

136

The total amount of NOx emissions in each sector can be seen in Table S5 and Figures S3 and S4. Examples

137

of the NO2 source apportionment can be seen in Figure 2.

sources in the TROPOMI NO2 retrievals with higher resolution than averaged vertical column densities.

144

The method was first applied over Riyadh, Germany and South Africa to estimate NOx emissions from

145

large point sources15,25. Due to TROPOMI’s higher spatial resolution compared with OMI, the flux

146

divergence method can identify emissions within individual urban areas26,37–39.

147

The flux divergence method works best with long temporal averages; for TROPOMI analyses, annual or

148

multi-year averages are used. We adapted the method for the current project to handle GCAS data from 27

149

individual scenes spanning 10 days. We found that the method worked best when the GCAS data was

150

oversampled to the 444 × 444 m2 CAMx grid. Only pixels with an aircraft roll angle below 0.5° were used.

151

We interpolated the WRF-CAMx winds to the time of the GCAS overpass. We used second-order

152

differences and performed the flux divergences along the x/y axes (i.e., using the cells to the north, south,

153

east, and west of the central cell). We also calculated the flux divergence for the cross-terms (i.e., using the

154

cells to the north-east, south-east, south-west and north-west of the central cell). Averaging both the x/y

155

estimate and the cross-estimate led to smoother divergence fields with less noise.

156

The method was initially performed using the GCAS standard retrievals and the ERA5 wind reanalysis

157

product40. While this gave good results, we found that the level of noise was reduced and the known sources

158

were better identified when we used the GCAS retrievals that were corrected using the CAMx air mass

159

factors, and when we used the WRF-CAMx meteorology. These sensitivity tests revealed that CAMx

160

simulations can be used to yield clear improvements in the flux divergence method.

Multiple linear regression model. For this study, we built a multiple linear regression (MLR) model

162

to find the optimal combination of the sectoral emissions simulated by CAMx that matches the GCAS

163

tropospheric vertical columns. CAMx simulations were made in Source Apportionment mode to separate

164

the NO2 vertical column densities associated with the 15 individual sources (e.g., EGU) and groups of

165

sources (on-road mobile) (Table S4). In practice, some of the emission sources in OSAT are too close

166

together to be able to be clearly distinguished from each other. We therefore merged the following: 1.

167

Channelview Cogeneration Facility and Odyssey Energy Altura Cogen, LLC; 2. Deer Park Energy Center

168

and Pasadena Power Plant; 3. Texas City Cogeneration, South Houston Green Power Site, and the “other”

169

category. Equation 1 shows the MLR model: the tropospheric vertical column density of GCAS is

170

represented as an optimal combination of the CAMx VCD from the 10 contributing sectors with a residual

171

given by ε. . In seeking an optimal match to the GCAS columns, it is important to apply a regularization

172

term to prevent unphysical results41. The optimal parameters (β) were determined by minimising the cost

173

function in Equation 2. The residual ε is minimised subject to the regularization parameter λ applied to the

174

magnitude of the scale factors (β). Equation 2 can be solved in a single Least Squares inversion41. We

175

applied the MLR model to the entire field campaign, and we also performed simulations separately for

176

weekdays and for weekends.

The regularization term, λ in Equation 2, imposes a cost on the departure of the posterior emissions from

180

the prior emissions. In this work, we chose a value of 25 because it balances the desire to maximize the

181

improvements in the model (lower grid residuals) while minimizing the departure from the prior (lower

182

emission residuals). By selecting this value, we achieve most of the improvements in the correlation

183

coefficient of the model without ending up with unrealistic scaling factors. The algorithm then balances the

184

cost in the change of the emissions with the cost of the mismatch between the GCAS retrievals and the sum

185

of the scaled fields from the source apportionment simulations. We assume as a prior that all scaling factors

186

are 1.

Results and Discussion

188

The first step in this project is to qualitatively compare the GCAS column NO2 measurements with

189

coincident measurements from TROPOMI and model output from CAMx. Spatial plots of column NO2 in

190

the early afternoon at the TROPOMI overpass time are shown in Figure 3 for a 10-day average and a single

191

day. By observing the 10-day average (top row), we can see that GCAS measurements are generally larger

192

than both the TROPOMI measurements and CAMx model output. TROPOMI captures the broad spatial

193

patterns observed by GCAS with a notable low bias. The TROPOMI low bias is partially driven by the 3.5

194

x 5.5 km2 spatial resolution which is unable to capture the peaks of the NO2 pollution, especially the NO2

195

in narrow point source plume42. Previous work shows that the air mass factor is a small contributor to this

196

low satellite bias in this area30, but this can vary by region43. The low satellite bias is consistent with

197

comparisons completed by the TROPOMI Cal-Val team44.

198

The GCAS versus CAMx intercomparison suggests that the point source plumes are captured by the model

199

with decent accuracy, but that NO2 is severely underestimated in the downtown area of Houston, as well as

200

in the outer portions of the model domain. This suggests two issues with the NO2 in CAMx: an

201

underestimate of NOx emissions near downtown Houston, and an underestimate of NO2 advected into the

202

model domain from the boundary conditions. In following sections, we explore these model biases

203

quantitatively.

NOx emissions using Flux divergence applied to GCAS. The flux divergence (FD) method applied

210

to the GCAS aircraft data quantified NO2 fluxes (μg/m2). To our knowledge, this paper is the first to quantify

211

NO2 fluxes by applying the FD method to aircraft remote sensing data. We identified many of the major

212

NOx sources individually in the Houston CAMx domain: power plants and refineries as well as the IAH

213

international airport (Figure 4 left panel). In addition, the method identified the area of the ship channel as

214

well as the route of the ships sailing through the Galveston Bay. Finally, the method clearly identified the

215

major highways in the region. The center panel of Figure 4 shows the flux divergence method applied to

216

the CAMx simulation. In this case, the sources are known and so these simulations serve to evaluate the

217

accuracy of the method. The method clearly recovers the main point and line sources used in the CAMx

218

simulations. The right panel of Figure 4 shows the ratio of the NO2 flux divergence (i.e., (CAMx-

219

GCAS)/GCAS) for the GCAS grid cells exceeding 0.2 μg-m2-s-1. Over the large point sources near the ship

220

channel, the values are a mix of positive and negative values suggesting that the emissions inventory is

221

relatively accurate in this location. Over highways, the values are strongly negative suggesting that actual

222

on-road emissions may be underestimated in the current inventory used as input to the CAMx model. In

223

theory, the 444 m spatial resolution model should be capturing the near-road NO2 concentrations with the

224

same precision as the GCAS which has similar spatial resolution. Over the ship paths, especially closer to

225

the Gulf of Mexico, the values are positive suggesting that some of the ship NOx emissions may be

226

overestimated in the inventory.

Use of machine learning to estimate emission factors for individual sectors. We applied the

234

MLR model to CAMx source apportionment NO2 sectoral output and GCAS NO2 data, as shown in

235

Equations 1 and 2, to estimate scaling factors for the sectoral NO2. All median scaling factors were between

236

a value of 0.5 and 2.5 as shown in Figure 5. A median value below 1 indicates the sector needs a NOx

237

decrease, while a median value greater than 1 indicates the sector needs a NOx increase. The box-and-

238

whisker plots represent the uncertainties of the scaling factors quantified by bootstrapping on two different

239

levels. The most important level for bootstrapping was randomly selecting, with replacement, the GCAS

240

rasters included in the optimization. For the full time series, there were 27 rasters over 10 days. In addition

241

to performing the simulations for these 27 rasters, we performed 100 simulations with random selections

242

of the 27 rasters. The second level for bootstrapping was to randomly select grid blocks within each raster

243

for use in the analysis. We randomly select 7 x 7 blocks of cells within the CAMx grid cells and include

244

them until we have the same number of points as in the initial grid. We did this 100 times for each selection

245

of rasters, leading to a total of 10,000 simulations.

246

The box-and-whisker plots in Figure 5 show that on-road mobile NOx emissions representing 19% of

247

domain emissions may be underestimated in the model and need to be scaled up by a median factor of 1.68,

248

which is consistent with findings using the FD method. Similarly, the MLR found railyard NOx emissions

249

should by increased by a median factor of 1.5. In contrast, the shipping NOx emissions representing 17%

250

of domain emissions may be overestimated and should be scaled by a median factor of 0.77, which is also

251

consistent with findings using the FD method, though it should be noted that the sign of the shipping

252

adjustment changes with the regularization factor. The EGU point sources are close to a scale factor of one,

253

which is expected given the use of emissions obtained from CAMPD measurements. The “other” sources

254

representing 54% of domain NOx emissions are underestimated, although this factor is particularly sensitive

255

to the regularization factor because it encompasses a diverse set of point and nonpoint sources. Finally, the

256

boxplot suggests that the NO2 background concentration is underestimated by CAMx by a median value of

257

0.7 x 1015 molec/cm2, which equates to a scaling factor of 2.2, and is consistent with qualitative findings

258

discussed earlier.

Results from an “Optimized NOx” CAMx simulation. We then performed a new “Optimized NOx”

265

CAMx simulation with on-road mobile and shipping NOx emissions adjusted to be in alignment with

266

findings from using the MLR. On-road mobile NOx emissions were increased by a factor of 1.68, and

267

shipping NOx emissions were decreased by multiplying by a factor of 0.77. Despite a large change to the

268

on-road NOx, the total NOx emissions in the domain only increased by 8.6% from 373 to 405 tons per day

269

(Table S5). We chose not to adjust the railyards and airport sectors because combined they represent less

270

than 3% of domain NOx emissions. We chose not to adjust the “other” sector or background / boundary

271

NO2 since there is no straightforward modification for those contributions.

272

When comparing the column NO2 from the Baseline and “Optimized NOx” simulations to the GCAS

273

measurements, we found better agreement and an improvement in bias, albeit a smaller improvement than

274

we had expected (Figure 6). The column NO2 low bias improved from –30.6% to –25.2% with a small

275

increase in correlation from r2=0.78 to r2=0.80. When we further add an artificial 0.7 x 1015 molec/cm2

276

column NO2 enhancement domain-wide – value acquired from the MLR – the NO2 low bias improves

277

further to –10.0%. The remaining low bias is likely due to not adjusting the “other” NOx emissions, which

278

represented 54% of domain NOx emissions in the Baseline simulation.

284

When comparing the column NO2 from the Baseline and “Optimized NOx” simulations to the Pandora

285

measurements, we found better agreement and an improvement in bias, albeit a smaller improvement than

286

we had expected (Figure 7). The column NO2 low bias improved from -20.2% to -17.8% with a small

287

increase in correlation from r2=0.39 to r2=0.41. However, much of the apparent low bias appears to be

288

driven by the large Pandora measured values. When then exclude values exceeding 10e15 molec/cm2 –

289

which approximate fine-scale NO2 plumes that we cannot expect CAMx to recreate in space due to the need

290

to match wind speed and direction. For moderately polluted scenes (values <10e15), the NO2 low bias is

291

only -6.8%. When evaluating the new model simulation improved from -6.8% to -3.4%; the correlation is

292

notably poor in both scenarios due to the smaller range of values.

Figure 8 shows a ratio difference plot of modeled column NO2 between the Baseline and “Optimized NOx”

301

simulations. The largest NO2 enhancements in the “Optimized NOx” simulation occurred in areas of west

302

Houston where there were no Pandora measurements (denoted as square boxes on the figure). The

303

maximum change in column NO2 was an increase of 29.6% in west Houston near a major highway

304

intersection, with a median column NO2 enhancement of +4.2% across the full model domain. Although

305

the model domain NOx emissions increased +8.6%, column NO2 only increased +4.2% because a

306

substantial amount of NO2 originates beyond the model domain.

simulation during the early afternoon (12:00 – 15:00 local time).

310

When comparing the MLR results between the Baseline and Optimized NOx simulations, we see substantial

311

improvement in the coefficients attributed to on-road and shipping emissions (Figure 9), while all other

312

coefficients remain largely steady. This indicates both the robustness of the method as well as a strong

313

indication that the adjustments made to the NOx emissions were appropriate. The on-road NOx emissions

314

may have been slightly overcorrected, and the “other” NOx emissions still need an adjustment up. As

315

expected, the coefficient attributed to the background NO2 did not change, and this would be more difficult

316

to control without modifying the boundary conditions or the NO2 lifetime. A longer discussion on the

317

influence of NO2 long-range transport on the MLR can be found in the supporting information.

322

Discussion. In this project, we were able to conduct a thorough analysis of NOx emissions in Houston,

323

Texas during September 2021 during the TRACER-AQ campaign. Prior work found column NO2 from

324

GCAS to have excellent agreement with Pandora measurements (r2=0.79 and NMB of +2.4%)30, suggesting

325

it can be used as the “truth” in validating the column NO2 CAMx model simulation. Column NO2 from

326

CAMx showed a substantial low bias when compared with Pandora (–20%) and GCAS measurements (–

327

31%), suggesting an underestimate of local NOx emissions.

328

This study expands upon previous work30 by applying additional measures to identify and quantify the

329

magnitude of NOx emissions. The FD method was able to distinguish the linear shape of major highways,

330

many of the large point sources, and the Galveston Bay ship track. The NO2 FD comparison between

331

CAMx and GCAS shows underestimates at highway locations. Through a multiple linear regression

332

model, we were able to isolate on-road, railyard, and “other” NOx emissions as the likeliest cause of this

333

low bias, while simultaneously finding that shipping NOx emissions may be overestimated. A new

334

“Optimized NOx” simulation was performed with on-road NOx emissions increased by a factor of 1.68

335

and shipping NOx emissions decreased by a factor of 0.77, and confirmed that these NOx adjustments

336

made to the inventory were reasonable and yielded better agreement with NO2 measurements acquired

337

during the TRACER-AQ campaign.

338

To our knowledge, this is the first time a source apportionment model was coupled with aircraft

339

measurements to identify uncertainties in the gridded NOx emissions inventory. Our analyses were

340

primarily conducted using column NO2 instead of surface NO2 to diagnose NOx emissions since vertical

341

mixing can be a source of error in a surface-only comparison. With finer spatial resolution and more

342

numerous NO2 measurements now available from TEMPO starting in August 2023, it is feasible that a

343

similar analysis could be conducted using satellite data. This project provides actionable information to

344

policymakers looking to understand where there are further opportunities to reduce NOx emissions and

345

improve ozone and PM2.5 air quality in metropolitan areas.
