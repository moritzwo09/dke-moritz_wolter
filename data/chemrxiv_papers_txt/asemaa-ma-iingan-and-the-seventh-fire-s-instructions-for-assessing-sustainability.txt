Abstract
From environmental impact statements to regulatory impact assessments, there are a variety of
analyses in the United States that measure sustainability to inform federal, state, and/or local
decision-making. Without procedures to ensure meaningful inclusion of Indigenous Knowledge
and respect for Indigenous sovereignty, we find that many assessments currently jeopardize the
discovery and development of truly sustainable solutions. Specifically, we evaluate how 17
different kinds of assessments (mis)align with Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin (Knowledge) on
Asemaa, Ma’iingan, and the Seventh Fire prophecy – teachings that guide sustainable relationships
between Physical, Plant, Animal, and Human Worlds. Our analysis is rooted in Anishinology and
Two-Eyed Seeing, practices that together guide our approach to bridging Anishinaabe
Gikendaasowin and Western scientific Knowledge and elucidate a more robust understanding of
sustainability. “Sustainability” stands at a crossroads; ultimately, this analysis provides guidance
for improving assessment protocols to ensure that current sustainability efforts do not repeat
injustices of the past.

The Seventh Fire Prophecy
The Seventh Fire marks a time when the Anishinaabeg and the other Peoples around them will
face a choice between two paths. One path is barren and charred, yet appears fast and easy; a
path burned in the fire, paved over, and left lifeless. It is a path where the current momentum goes
unchecked and causes rapid, irreparable destruction. The other path is unpaved – it is not fast or
easy, but it is lush and rewarding. A path where fire leads to new life that requires those who walk
it to be careful and considerate. It requires the Anishinaabeg and other Peoples to work together,
to restore their relationships with each other and with the Physical, Plant, and Animal Worlds
around them. The Physical, Plant, and Animal Worlds are the older, wiser relatives of the Human
World. While these older-than-human relatives do not rely on humans for survival, humans by
contrast are entirely dependent on their Physical, Plant, and Animal relatives. Healing humanity’s
relationships with the Physical, Plant, and Animal Worlds requires healing the relationships
between Peoples as well. Only by walking this path together can life prevail.

Indigenous Peoples stand to be disproportionately impacted by green energy projects.4
Though motivated by current climatic and environmental crises, these projects often fail to grasp
that, for many Indigenous Peoples, climate change and the imminent manmade, sixth mass
extinction event are continuations of crises born from historical and ongoing colonial oppression.5
The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues cites colonialism as a dominant force of
environmental destruction,6 warning that without proper regard for Indigenous free, prior, and
informed consent, green energy projects aiming to mitigate the climate crisis could instead
engender Green Colonialism.7 With the majority of critical minerals necessary for electric vehicles
located on or near Indigenous lands,4 there is an urgent need to understand the role of Indigenous
self-determination in decision-making.
In the United States, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act sets bold targets for domesticallysourced critical minerals,8 and the homelands of the Anishinaabeg (the Ojibwe/Chippewa,
Potawatomi, Odawa, and other Tribes) throughout the northern Great Lakes region in the U.S. and

Canada are prime candidates for new and/or expanded mining activities.9 The planning, design,
implementation, and management processes of these operations will govern whether they move
society towards climate solutions or repeat exploitative patterns of the past.10 In turn, these
processes are governed by a suite of assessment protocols broadly referred to here as
“sustainability assessments.” These assessments inform decision-making at federal, state, and/or
local levels, and they measure one or more of the four pillars of sustainability: environmental,
social, cultural, and economic sustainability.11–13 Specifically, we examine (see Supplementary
Information (SI) Section 1 for more detail):
Cultural Impact Assessment (CIA),
Cumulative Impact Assessment (CumulIA),
Ecological Risk Assessment (EcoRA),
Environmental Impact Assessment/Statement (EIA),
Environmental Life Cycle Analysis (ELCA),
Health Impact Assessment (HIA),
Heritage Impact Assessment (HeritageIA),
Human Health Risk Assessment (HealthRA),
Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA),
Permitting (Permits),
Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA),
Social Impact Assessment (SIA),
Social Life Cycle Analysis (SLCA),
Technoeconomic Analysis (TEA),
Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (Local) (LocTHIRA),
Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (National) (NatTHIRA), and
Tribal Cumulative Impact Assessment (TribalCumulIA).

President Biden’s recent federal policy shift to prioritize mining in the United States places
an increasing importance on assessment frameworks that enable just and sovereignty-affirming
decision-making. The question is not will there or will there not be mining; critical minerals are
required for a decarbonized future.14 The question is who gets to decide where and how this mining
happens; who gets to decide what is sustainable.
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognizes that “Indigenous
governance systems supported sustainable lifeways over thousands of years” and calls for
Indigenous Knowledge (IK) to underpin sustainability measures ranging from conservation efforts
to impact assessments.15 Meanwhile, the Biden administration pushed federal agencies to “apply
Indigenous Knowledge in decision making, research, and policies across the Federal
Government.”16,17 Responding to these international and domestic directions for greater
application of IK, we employ an approach that grounds Western-based analytical methods within
Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin (Knowledge) on sustainability.
Many studies explore how to apply both IK and Western scientific Knowledge (SK),18–22
with Anishinology and Two-Eyed Seeing exemplifying two distinct practices for the nearly
universal task Indigenous Peoples undertake to braid IK and SK together (see Methods).2,23–25
Anishinology is the basis for this work and the relationships that produced it, described by Ojibwe
Elder Marvin DeFoe as a practice of blending science and humanity.26,27 The first, and primary,
aspect of this work involved the humanity aspect of Anishinology: attending talking circles,
memorial events, and other gatherings to cultivate relationships from a place of humanity – to
share emotions, build trust, and form connections of kinship that surpass conventional
collaboration.1,26,28 Knowledge diffused along these bridges of relationship, blending IK and
Western SK into an understanding of sustainability based on science, humanity, culture, and
Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin.
Two-Eyed Seeing – a process of applying the strengths of IK and SK in tandem, developed
by Mi’kmaq Elders Albert Marshall and Murdena Marshall alongside Dr. Cheryl Bartlett – then
outlined the structure for this analytical work.18–21 The blended understanding from Anishinology
is distilled here as three Anishinaabe teachings presented in parallel with the three primary
conclusions from the Western-based analytical methods. One eye is on the Western science-driven
findings; one eye evaluates these findings against Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin:

Results

Consent
After creating the Physical, Plant, and Animal Orders, the Creator formed man and placed the
first man on the Earth. When this first man beheld the world around him, he was awestruck.
Awestruck by the beauty of the water, soil, grasses, trees, insects, and animals in such abundance.
In his reverence, he stood completely still. For days he did not move, too afraid of the damage
even a single step would cause. No matter how careful he might be, he knew there was no way he
could take a step without injuring a relative, be it a patch of grass or even a small insect. But he
also could not survive by staying still, and the other Orders of Creation knew this. The Spirit of
Asemaa (tobacco) came to his aid. Appearing before him, Asemaa taught the first man how to
move through Creation with humility and respect. Yes, Asemaa acknowledged, man is too
dependent on the other Orders, too unequipped, and too new to the world to move without causing
harm. But as long as man asks for permission and honors the response, he can minimize harm and
ensure a strong, lasting, prosperous relationship with all Orders of Creation.

Consent separates relationships of care from relationships of violence. Asemaa teaches that
sustainable relationships between and within the Four Orders of Creation (Physical, Plant, Animal,
and Human) cannot exist without consent. The Human World is dependent on the older Orders of
Creation,27,30 and the lessons from Asemaa show the Anishinaabeg how to engage in consensual
relations with these older-than-human relatives (SI Section 2). The United Nations Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples underscores the fundamental connection between free, prior, and
informed consent and sovereignty.31 Sovereignty is Indigenous Peoples’ inherent right to selfdetermination and self-governance.31,32 Assessments that fail to maintain sovereignty-affirming
methods risk violating the self-determination and self-governance of Indigenous Peoples;
accordingly, previous research explores how models, impact assessments, and regional/project
planning support or violate Indigenous self-determination.10,33–36 In particular, Larsen 2018
provides a foundation for evaluating how participation modes (community-owned, comanagement, consultation, and notification) vary across assessment steps (scoping, evidence
generation, significance determination, and follow-up) through his analysis of Indigenous
participation in Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Norwegian, and Swedish impact
assessments.35
We expand on Larsen’s work by including 17 different assessment methods, evaluating a
more detailed set of assessment steps, and considering ambiguous modes of participation (SI
Tables S.1-S.3). We define “community-owned” as denoting sovereignty-affirming participation
procedures, co-management as sovereignty-supporting participation procedures, consultation as
sovereignty-feigning, and notification as sovereignty-violating (SI Table S.3). Ambiguity arises
when authority over the assessment and/or decision-making is uncertain, such as when Tribal
authorities may or may not lead an assessment and situations where an unspecified or non-Tribal
authority delineates the mode of participation for Tribes.

method. (Y) markings indicate that the protocols explicitly reference IK, Traditional

participation in TEA.

The mode of participation varies both within and between methodologies (Figure 1). Each
assessment method displays a unique pattern of participation, but opportunities for participation
are generally more frequent in earlier assessment steps like scoping, data collection, and analysis,
a similar finding as in Larsen 2018.35 Limited opportunities for participation in the earliest
screening step (deciding whether and how to conduct the assessment) and in later decision-making

steps could mean Indigenous Peoples are exploited for their knowledge and/or resources but left
out of final decisions.37,38
In particular, participation in the permitting process, EIA protocols, and RIA protocols
occurs primarily via notification and consultation. Of the assessments we evaluated, permitting
and EIA greatly influence decisions about large-scale projects requiring state and federal approvals.
RIA meanwhile directly informs federal policy choices. These assessments have not adopted
practices that affirm Indigenous sovereignty; notification violates sovereignty while consultation
could simply pay it lip service. Despite the Tribal consultation guidelines of many government
agencies, how consultation transpires in reality spans a variety of participation modes (see
Methods). Quoting legal scholars, the Congressional Research Service notes that “‘consultation
remains vague and [practically] unenforceable.’”39 References to consultation in assessment
protocol language therefore fail to ensure Tribal sovereignty support, hence our label of
“sovereignty-feigning.” Other federally-influential assessments include HeritageIA, NRDA, and
EcoRA, all of which are marked by high levels of ambiguity in terms of actual participation
practices. ELCA and SLCA are incorporated in some policies such as the Renewable Fuel
Standard40 and are generally meant to provide a holistic measure of sustainability, yet these
methods also limit participation to notification and consultation.
The Wehipeihana Model of Indigenous evaluation (Fig. 2) describes how evaluation can
be done to, for, with, by, or as Indigenous Peoples,41,42 and here we align it with Larsen 2018’s
framework. Notification indicates assessment processes that are done to Indigenous Peoples,
consultation indicates processes done for Indigenous Peoples, co-management indicates processes
done by Indigenous Peoples, and community-owned indicates processes done as Indigenous
Peoples.35,41,42 For, with, by, and as represent a continuum ranging from minimal Indigenous
participation within exclusively Western-scientific approaches (for) to complete Indigenous
control over the methods and values defining the assessment (as).41,42 While lacking distinction by
assessment step, visualizing where the assessments fall on the Wehipeihana Model allows for a
high-level understanding of which assessments require the most adjustment to at minimum support
and ideally affirm sovereignty.41,42

Indigenous evaluation. Note that ambiguous language regarding participation generates high
uncertainty for many assessment methods. Uncertainty bars represent how an assessment’s
location on the plot could shift if all ambiguous language is transformed to community-owned
(bar towards the right) or notification (bar towards the left) language (see Methods).

Previous research generally does not mention the prevalence of ambiguous language in
assessment protocols,34,35 but the application of ambiguous language in practice likely governs the
level of sovereignty-affirmation or violation (Fig. 2). Ambiguous language poses sovereignty

violation risks, but also leaves room for the procedures to adopt sovereignty-affirming
methodologies. Such growth demands specific language requiring Indigenous co-management (at
minimum) in any situation impacting Indigenous sovereignty. Procedures must specify that only
Tribes themselves can waive participation by co-management.
Some assessment protocols could serve as guides for improving assessment methods.
TribalCumulIA procedures co-written by several Tribal organizations and EPA Region 5 include
many instances of co-management language,43 while draft TribalCumulIA procedures written by
Honor the Earth for the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe offer strong examples of community-owned
processes.44 Additionally, emphasis on community control of the assessment pushes LocTHIRA
toward “as,” but it should be noted that without explicit reference to IK there is still a risk that
actual assessment implementation could exclude Indigenous methodologies and values. In fact,
FEMA’s THIRA guidelines require standardized language that could limit meaningful Indigenous
participation (see Table 2), yet clarifications that communities can choose to incorporate their own
language could still support IK inclusion.45
Studying protocol language is not the same as studying real-world assessment
implementation, and this analysis does not assess any agency guidelines on Tribal consultation not
outlined in assessment procedures. Still, our approach can guide future work in these areas. For
now, protocol language indicates, at least qualitatively, whether the assessment methods that
inform decision making will affirm or violate sovereignty. The majority of assessments analyzed
here fall somewhere between assessments for and by Indigenous Peoples, in the “with” space
where consultation often replaces consent. Asemaa did not teach the Human World to consult.
Asemaa taught the Human World to ask permission; Asemaa spoke of consent. Consultation fails
to ensure consent-based relationships among the Four Orders of Creation. Honoring these
interconnected relationships is crucial for a sustainable future.

Connection
The Creator sent the Ma’iingan (wolf) and the Anishinaabe to travel the world together, naming
the plants, animals, and other relatives they encountered. When their travels were complete, the
Creator said they must be separated but would forever maintain a brotherhood. The Creator told

them that Ma’iinganag and Anishinaabeg would be forever connected, and whatever happens to
one will happen to the other.
-

Based on teachings from many accounts, but especially from Marvin DeFoe Shingwe Bines,
Neme (Sturgeon) Clan, member of Gaa-miskwaabikaang (the Red Cliff Band of Lake
Superior Chippewa).26

The Anishinaabeg teach that human well-being is intrinsically tied to broader ecological
well-being.2,46 Sustainability, and the assessments that measure it, must respect these connections
between the Four Orders of Creation. Assessments may aspire to include multiple kinds of
environmental, social, economic, and/or cultural effects; however, most specialize in only one or
occasionally two of these pillars of sustainability (see SI Section 3). Many assessments defer to
other assessments to fill the gaps outside their primary focus. The assessments are therefore highly
intertwined. Mapping instances where one assessment references another in its protocols (Fig. 3),
direct connections emerge between all 17 assessment methods. EIA and permits in particular are
hubs that connect many assessments. The key role EIA and other permitting documents play in
decision-making processes cement these assessments as valuable sources of data, recipients of
other assessment data, and subjects of improvement efforts. Additional, indirect connections are
outlined in SI Section 4.
With most individual assessments providing only a partial measure of sustainability,
assessments accordingly work best collectively. Health effects not considered in EcoRA are
considered in HealthRA; social effects not considered in ELCA are considered in SLCA. However,
relying on connections between over a dozen assessment methods instead of focusing on fewer,
more holistic methods generates a complex and burdensome assessment space. Tribes often
contend with limited capacity to undertake multiple assessments, and evaluating environmental,
social, economic, or cultural impacts in separate assessments is antithetical to many Indigenous
teachings of interconnected human and older-than-human well-being. It is not enough, nor is it
possible, to merely “include” IK; the assessment frameworks themselves need to be rebuilt by
Indigenous Knowledge holders and Western scientists alike. Fewer assessments employing codeveloped methods would generate a less burdensome yet more robust sustainability assessment
space, reducing capacity demand and affirming Indigenous participation “by” or “as”.

What happens to Ma’iinganag happens to the Anishinaabeg,47 and increasingly DeFoe
expects what happens to Ma’iinganag will happen to all humankind.26 The brotherhood between
the Anishinaabeg and Ma’iinganag represents the overarching connection between the Human
World and the older Orders of Creation.26 As human actions violate these connections, the fate of
Ma’iinganag ultimately foreshadows the fate of all people.26 Assessments that fail to holistically
evaluate sustainability jeopardize these connections between the Four Orders of Creation.
Alternatively, assessments that are co-built with Indigenous Knowledge systems would inherently
encompass these connections. Co-developing such assessments cannot happen unless the
procedures that underpin assessments all respect sovereignty.
Discussion

Kinship – Returning to The Seventh Fire Prophecy
The Seventh Fire warns of the consequences that arise when relationships deteriorate.
Methodologies centering reciprocity, respect, care, and justice are necessary for the relationship
restoration and kinship essential to any genuine sustainability efforts.46,48–53 For sustainability
assessments, kinship forms when procedures embrace diverse knowledge systems. Weaving
knowledge systems together forms a more robust understanding of sustainability than any single
knowledge system could glean on its own.2,18–21,54 Here, Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin gives
meaning to and examples of sustainable, sovereignty-affirming practices, while the analysis results
point to the changes required for assessments to guide sustainable decision-making according to
this Knowledge (Fig. 4).

Kinship
Navigating the Seventh Fire goes beyond
collaboration. Kinship is collaboration built
on connections and consent, honoring
both Indigenous and Western Knowledge.

Connection
Shift from a large number of externally
connected assessments to fewer, more
holisitic assessments that internally
account for the connections between all
pillars of sustainability.

Consent
Assessment procedures must embrace
consent-based practices, requiring at
mininmum co-management approaches
that respect Indigenous sovereignty.

The Seventh Fire
Fire can either nurture or destroy. The time
of the Seventh Fire demands that diverse
Peoples carefully build and walk a lush path
together or risk devastation.

Ma’iingan
The Anishinaabeg and the Ma’iinganag
are brothers -- their well-being is
inseparable. Consent-based practices
protect such connections among the Four
Orders of Creation.

Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin Guidance for Sustainability
Figure 4: The relationship between the Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin guiding this work and the analysis
conclusions.

There is a significant gap between current assessment protocols and practices that support
sovereignty. Consultation and mere IK inclusion can reinforce extractive tendencies that exploit
IK only as a supplement to Western scientific Knowledge and only when convenient.55 Kinshipbased approaches demand that sustainability assessment methods evolve from such “check-thebox” consultative practices to practices that support Indigenous participation according to their
own values, knowledge, and leadership.38 Given that only eight out of the seventeen assessment
methods evaluated here contain any reference to IK, TK, and/or TEK (Fig. 1), sustainability
assessments in the U.S. largely lack such kinship-based approaches. White House directives (2021,
2022) may encourage IK inclusion, but Table 1 outlines examples of language in sustainability
assessment protocols that act as barriers to legitimate Indigenous engagement .10,34,36,55

Description
Western Scientific Knowledge is privileged over
Indigenous Knowledge as seen through preference for
technocratic, externally-imposed approaches; defining
importance, value, and/or significance based on narrow,
human-centered considerations; inflexible use of
standardized language or methods; assuming ecological
relationships can be replaced; excluding impacts not yet
understood by Western science; and/or the misuse of
Indigenous Knowledge (“cherry-picking,” lack of Tribal
control, etc.) This theme also includes the diminishment of
community input as potentially unreliable or unaligned
with scientific integrity and the diminishment of values or
methods not standard to Western science.
Emphasizing the use of scientific literature, standards,
peer review, and/or the judgement/expertise of experts,
professionals, or specialists without clarification that
Indigenous Knowledge is a form of expertise and
Indigenous Knowledge holders are experts.
Preferring or prioritizing quantitative methods over
qualitative approaches, including the use of quantitative
indicators or impacts that lack flexibility for qualitative
considerations.

(D)

There is a focus on economic impact indicators and/or
monetization of impacts, including the use of
compensation as a means to mitigate impacts via
relocation or other means. This theme also includes
emphasis on functional value in opposition to intrinsic
value and limiting what assessment is conducted, what
methods are used, and what alternatives are considered
based on economic considerations.

Explicit references to discounting impacts to future
generations and/or discounting impacts the more in the
future they occur.

Environmental
disconnect
(H)

An assessment specifically notes that it considers only
environmental impacts without consideration of social or
economic impacts or vice versa. Includes cases where the
consideration of interconnected environmental and social
effects is specifically noted as optional.

Failure to
disclose
(I)

The assessment is described as often going undisclosed
based on practitioner discretion.
Indigenous sovereignty is violated due to unilateral
decision-making; avenues for bypassing Tribal
agreements, laws, and/or authority; Tribal authorities are
not included as decision-makers or are categorized as part
of broader public without sovereignty recognition;
participatory processes are described as optional without
clarifying requirements for respecting Tribal sovereignty;
and/or free, prior, and informed consent is described as an
aim and not a requirement.

Real-world assessment performance may pose additional barriers or demonstrate
improvements in sovereignty affirmation not reflected in protocol language; the level of
ambiguous language (Fig. 2 and 3) leaves the degree of Indigenous engagement to the assessment
practitioner’s discretion. Moreover, several of these barriers exist to maintain decision-making
processes informed by scientific data, ideally independent of corrupting influences (described in
the middle column of Table 2). A sustainable future requires scientifically-informed, expertbacked decisions; at the same time, a sustainable future also requires respect for human rights and
Indigenous sovereignty. “Expert” and “scientific” must include Indigenous Knowledge holders
and IK-based methods. The barriers outlined in Table 1 act as tipping points where assessments
could slide down toward sovereignty violation (left column of Table 2) or step up to sovereignty
affirmation (right column of Table 2).
Honoring Indigenous Knowledge does not mean diminishing Western science; many
Indigenous Knowledge holders recognize both the value of Western science and the opportunities
for it to learn from IK. Respect for both knowledge systems is likely one reason TribalCumulIA
maps closer to “by” than “as” on the Wehipeihana Model; the protocols co-developed by
Anishinaabe Tribes and the U.S. EPA Region 5 emphasize partnership and coordination while the
draft protocols written by Honor the Earth and the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe outline examples of
Western methodologies that could align with Anishinaabe values.43,44 Kinship is not about
replacing one hierarchy with another; kinship breaks down hierarchy to foster collaborations based
on consent and connection. To begin this process, Western science must respect the intellectual
heritage IK represents. This heritage stems from the deep, irreplaceable understanding of
ecological relationships and responsibilities upheld by Indigenous Peoples from generations of
lived observation.

comparisons

Indigenous values shape considerations that,
while not “objective,” include morality and
ethics

Quantitative results often considered an
objective means to limit biased influences

Economics are considered as one part, not as
the whole; compensation is not a substitute
for intact health and ecosystems

Economic implications are important to
consider – decisions should not burden
already financially strained communities

Barriers E, F, G, & H

Indigenous history, sovereignty, and inherent
right to govern their ancestral lands is
ignored and violated

Affirming
Assessments utilize a seven-generation
approach that honors the connection between
human and environmental health
Indigenous Knowledge relayed through
story-telling is treated with respect
Capacity-building programs are implemented
so marginalized groups can conduct

Sovereignty stands at a crossroads in many arenas. After failing to meaningfully consult
with the Ojibwe, Wisconsin’s 2021 wolf hunt devastated the kinship between Ma’iinganag and
their Physical, Plant, Animal, and Anishinaabeg relatives.47,56,57 Meanwhile, the Minnesota
Legislature’s repeated attempts for the benefit of mining activities to remove or weaken the sulfate
standard that protects manoomin (wild rice) ignore both Indigenous and Scientific Knowledge.58
Still, there are opportunities for kinship. For example, the governor of Minnesota vetoed the efforts
to repeal the sulfate standard, noting that delegates “decided — based upon their own subjective
analyses — that they do not like the science.”58 The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed
the Anishinaabeg’s usufructuary treaty rights, stating that “Indian treaty rights can coexist with
state management of natural resources.”59,60 Recent EPA regulations require states to consider such
Tribal reserved rights when developing water quality standards,61 and in 2021 the U.S. Department
of the Interior and Department of Agriculture issued a joint order for co-stewardship with Indian
Tribes.62
As regulators hopefully continue to trend towards consensus and co-management,
sustainability assessment frameworks must likewise shift from methods of consultation to methods
of consent, honoring Indigenous sovereignty and weaving IK and SK together. Here, we embrace
Anishinology and Two-Eyed Seeing approaches. Western science-based techniques guide our
methods, while Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin shared over years of relationship-building frame the
concepts of sustainability and sovereignty at the heart of our work. White House guidance may
change. Government agency procedures may change. Against the often-unreliable attitudes of U.S.
federal and state decision-makers, Anishinaabe Gikendaasowin holds firm and has held firm since
time immemorial.55 These teachings illustrate that sustainability respects the connection between
nature and people, between the Ma’iinganag and the Anishinaabeg. Sustainability restores
reverence for the Four Orders of Creation and the practice of consent. Sustainability means
working together and working with care, ensuring that the Seventh Fire yields a just path walked
together.

research to incorporate Indigenous Knowledge into sustainability decision making. GLIFWC
members have attended workshops she has organized on the topic of sustainable minerals in
Santiago, Chile, and Evanston, Illinois to contribute their insights to the development of this
research.
This work began with a series of three listening sessions in February and March of 2021.27
The listening sessions included Ojibwe Tribal Members and staff from the Great Lakes Indian Fish
and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC), and they were conducted as part of a National Science
Foundation (NSF) award encouraging Tribally-led research (NSF Award No. 2044053).
Researchers at the listening sessions brought their skills to the discussion, but worked to not bring
pre-conceived ideas of research projects. Instead, Ojibwe Tribal Members, GLIFWC staff, and
Northwestern University researchers co-generated collaboration ideas based on the Knowledge
and concerns shared by Tribal Members. Since 2021, the authors of this paper based at
Northwestern University have attended numerous events, meetings, and gatherings hosted by
Ojibwe Tribes and/or GLIFWC. Over the course of these years of listening, sharing, and
relationship-building, a common theme arose from conversations: the vital role of sovereignty in

26

Tribal efforts to preserve lifeways and mitigate/adapt to climate change. Essentially, the vital role
of sovereignty in sustainability. Many discussions referenced the capacity challenges of navigating
federal/state decision making and the assessments that are part of decision-making processes, and
the teachings guiding this analysis were shared in multiple contexts over the years.
The concept for this analysis was not formulated until after this period of relationshipbuilding and listening (efforts that remain ongoing); it was critical that authors have a foundation
of trust and a shared understanding of how sustainability presents itself in Ojibwe teachings.
Moreover, these relationships extend beyond this analysis, with continuing collaboration and
partnership. Before embarking on the analysis, Margaret O’Connell asked permission from
Kathleen Smith, Mike Wiggins Jr., and Marvin DeFoe Shingwe Bines to understand if it would
appropriate to center the teachings of the Seventh Fire, Asemaa, and Ma’iingan in the
analysis.1,26,28 When permission was granted, she sought guidance on how to respectfully honor
the teachings in the work. O’Connell – a chemical engineer by training – worked with Anishinaabe
Gikendaasowin holders and other coauthors with backgrounds in law, political science, and
ecology to co-produce this work with an Anishinology foundation and Two-Eyed Seeing
methodology:
Anishinology: Anishinology is a knowledge system named by Ojibwe Elder Marvin
DeFoe.26,27 DeFoe describes Anishinology as a process of blending science and humanity
in a way that honors “Natural Law.”26 This Natural Law is not made by humans, nor can
it be changed by humans; it is the Law that governs relationships among the Four Orders
of Creation and serves as the fundamental basis for sustainability.26 DeFoe notes that for
too long Western SK has separated itself from IK and from the practice of humanity.26
Ojibwe Elder Kathleen Smith elaborates on this, explaining that while Western science
excels in the practice of listening and seeing, the crossroads of the Seventh Fire demands
that we use all of our senses; it demands that we feel.1 The Seventh Fire demands that we
allow emotion to connect us to the Natural World, restoring kinship with the Physical,
Plant, and Animal Worlds as well as with each other.1
Two-Eyed Seeing: Mi’kmaq Elders Albert Marshall and Murdena Marshall alongside Dr.
Cheryl Bartlett developed Etuaptmumk (“Two-Eyed Seeing”) to describe a practice
employing the strengths of both Indigenous and Western Knowledge systems.18–21 Two-

Eyed Seeing involves Knowledge systems co-producing without overruling, respecting
the strengths and limitations of both SK and IK so that they most effectively improve
outcomes for all.18–21
The teachings framing this analysis were not extracted to supplement analysis efforts – the
teachings are the analysis; they are the motivation behind the analysis and the basis for
understanding sustainability and sovereignty in the analysis. Above all else, the authors wish to
emphasize the critical role listening plays in the methods for this research. The remainder of this
Methods section details the analysis steps that took place after meaningful listening and
relationship-building formed the foundation for the collaboration.
The assessments considered here were chosen based on literature searches of Indigenous
involvement in various forms of impact assessment, author expertise and experience with different
assessment methods, and an informal “snowball sampling” approach incorporating assessments
referred to by other assessments. The analysis focuses on the protocols for conducting the
assessments, and Table S.1 in SI Section 1 lists the protocol sources evaluated for each assessment
method. U.S. federal rules, regulations, or agency policies were given first priority for analysis;
followed by state rules or policies – specifically guidance from Hawaii on Cultural Impact
Assessment; Minnesota’s mining permitting requirements; and guidance from international
organizations such as the United Nations, International Organization for Standardization, the
International Association for Impact Assessment, and others. Hawaii was the only state the authors
could find at the time of writing with guidance for Cultural Impact Assessment specifically, and
while permitting requirements will vary by state, mining permitting requirements from MN were
analyzed given MN’s history of mining, the present push for critical minerals mining within the
state to satisfy electric vehicle demand, and the location of MN within Anishinaabe ancestral
homelands. Academic literature and organization websites also served as sources.
Analysis took place on over 50 sources to yield a robust understanding of the assessment
protocols. Some assessments required analysis of more individual protocol documents than others
based on complexity, variability of sources of protocols, and/or quantity of documentation
available. As assessment protocols evolve over time, future efforts should expand on this form of
analysis to include updated protocols and even additional assessment methodologies. Here, we
considered assessments both directly tied to federal, state, or local decision-making and

28

assessments frequently referred to in literature regarding Indigenous participation in impact
assessment, generating an analytical framework that can be broadly applied to future research
efforts as assessments ideally develop improved participatory, sovereignty-affirming methods.
This analysis includes assessments that cover all four pillars of sustainability (environmental,
social, economic, and cultural). SI Section 1 Table S.2 gives descriptions of each assessment,
quoted from their own protocols in Table S.1.
Each assessment method was thematically coded with the assistance of the qualitative data
analysis software NVivo 20 1.6.2. Coding is a method for discovering patterns and themes in
qualitative data that allow the researcher to identify connections within and across data.63 Coding
identified a) participatory language (Figures 1 and 2), b) direct connections among assessments
(Figure 3), and c) challenges to Indigenous Knowledge inclusion (Tables 1 and 2).
The first round of analysis involved pulling language regarding participation into a
condensed document. This language was then coded as either community-owned, co-management,
consultation, notification, or a combination of two or more. Combinations of participation levels
were grouped together as “ambiguous.” The assessment step associated with the language was also
coded initially as one of the following options: screening, scoping, data collection, analysis,
decision, implementation, dissemination, and/or unspecified. Unspecified refers to general
statements about the role of Tribal, community, public, and/or other forms of participation in the
assessment without specifying a particular aspect or step of the assessment during which such
participation would occur. SI Section 1 Table S.3 provides additional descriptions of these codes.
One particular segment of language may refer to multiple assessment steps, with some having
different participation levels than others. In these cases, annotations specified which participation
level is associated with which participation step. Subsequent iterations of analysis re-examined
each coded instance based on participation level to ensure consistent coding across participation
level definitions, followed by re-examination of each coded instance of assessment steps to ensure
consistency.
Within each assessment, the total number of participation references was summed, and
frequency was calculated based on the percentage of references to a certain assessment step at a
certain participation level out of the total number of participation references in the assessment.
Therefore, in Figure 1, the frequency bars for each assessment sum across assessment steps to one
29

hundred percent. This calculation method enables both qualitative comparison of how frequently
participation during one step of the assessment is referenced compared to other steps and
qualitative comparison of the frequency of different kinds of participation (community-owned, comanagement, etc.) referenced within each participation step. While the exact quantitative results
may vary depending on if more or less protocol documentation is included and individual
interpretation of language, the qualitative trends in participation level and assessment step
frequency should remain consistent, with this analysis providing a critical baseline understanding
of the current landscape of Indigenous participation within assessment protocols.
After measuring the frequency of each participation level within each participation step,
and the frequency of participation in each participation step throughout the overall assessment, an
overall score was assigned to the assessment following the Wehipeihana Model of Indigenous
evaluation to generate Figure 2. To scores at a -2, for scores at a -1, with at 0, by at +1, and as at
+2 based on their relative positions along the decision-making axis. Accordingly, for each
assessment, community-owned language references were weighted with a +2, co-management
references were weighted with a +1, consultation was weighted with a -1, and notification was
weighted with a -2, producing a weighted average normalized by the total number of communityowned, co-management, consultation, and notification references in the assessment protocol. The
weighted average was then re-calculated assuming all ambiguous references are applied as
community-owned (+2) and then assuming all ambiguous references are notification (-2) to
produce the upper and lower error bounds, respectively.
It should be noted that “consultation” as used in this analysis differs from how consultation
is applied in many U.S. federal government settings. Without specific requirements by the U.S.
federal government, community-owned, co-management, and notification forms of interacting
with Tribes could all be considered different types of “consultation.” Consultation is often
categorized as either “Big C” Consultation or “Little c” consultation, where “Big C” Consultation
involves formal government-to-government interactions between Tribal leaders and U.S. federal
decision-makers while “Little c” consultation encompasses more informal communications
between agencies and Tribes not at a government-to-government level.64 Lack of clarity on
consultation definitions means that, in practice, there is often ambiguity on when Big C

30
https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rbqj6 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2065-5106 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Consultation is required, and Little c consultation too often acts as a substitute to meaningful
government-to-government consultation.
In practice, “consultation” can therefore range from notification to consensus-building. The
Congressional Research Services describes the “Federal-Tribal Consultation Spectrum” as ranging
from “Communication – Parties communicate about a proposed federal action” to “Consent –
Tribe or other Indigenous entity gives or withholds agreement with a proposed federal action.”39
For the purpose of this analysis, we employ methods that distinguish consultation as more than
notification but less than co-management or community-ownership (see SI Table S.3 for details
on how this definition was applied). Distinguishing between these modes of participation enables
a greater level of clarity than classifying all as some form of consultation and highlights the need
for language that more specifically recognizes sovereignty than the current consultation paradigm.
As a result of the myriad, inconsistent application of consultation, we mapped “consultation” to
“for” on the Wehipeihana Model of Indigenous evaluation – implying minimal Indigenous input
within almost exclusively Western frameworks and no final decision-making authorty.41,42 “With”
implies a level of collaboration not currently guaranteed by consultation requirements.
The next aspect of this analysis illustrated the direct connections between the assessments.
Direct connections are instances where one assessment directly mentions another assessment in its
protocols, with these direct references largely referring to data sharing, sharing legal/regulatory
mandates, similar framework basis, improvements or expansions of another assessment,
integration with another assessment, acting as a subcomponent to another assessment, or broadly
referring to another assessment by name without specifying in what capacity they are connected.
Table S.4 in the SI Section 4 outlines additional indirect, thematic connections between
assessments.
The final aspect of this analysis identified barriers to full Indigenous participation in
assessments; barriers limiting the respectful honoring of Indigenous Knowledge within assessment
procedures. Referring to Anishinology and Two-Eyed Seeing as guiding examples of Indigenous
ontologies, these barriers prevent the weaving of knowledge systems together. The barriers reflect
challenges identified by our collaborators through their own experiences with these assessments
and parallel many challenges identified in previous studies as well.10,34,36,55 In particular, instances

of capacity burdens and restrictions on worldview, ways of knowing, and/or ways of
communicating knowledge were coded into themes as they arose while analyzing protocol
language. These themes were then condensed into the primary categories of barriers listed in Table
1, with Table 2 subsequently highlighting tangible steps needed to overcome these barriers.
