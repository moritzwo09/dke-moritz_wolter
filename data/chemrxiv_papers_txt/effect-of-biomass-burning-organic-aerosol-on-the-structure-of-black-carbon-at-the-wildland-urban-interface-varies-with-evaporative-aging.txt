Environmental significance

10

Wildland fires are a significant source of primary organic aerosol, called biomass burning

11

organic aerosol (BBOA). When this material crosses the wildland-urban interface (WUI),

12

it can interact with urban black carbon (BC), uncoated aggregates with fractal, highly

13

branched structures, emitted largely from diesel engines. Specifically, it can partition onto

14

BC, resulting in restructuring due to surface tension and capillary forces. Here, we show

15

in saturator-condenser experiments that fresh BBOA from sources close to the WUI is

16

more effective by volume at restructuring BC than evaporatively aged BBOA from sources

17

far from the WUI. The resulting morphologies dictate how the particles will interact with

18

radiation and water vapor, interactions that govern their direct and indirect effects on

19

climate, respectively.

Abstract

22

Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) and black carbon (BC) play significant roles in

23

climate, via their interactions with light and clouds, as well as public health. BC in the

24

urban atmosphere, largely emitted by diesel vehicles, is initially highly branched and

25

fractal, but it can be restructured upon coating. Urban BC aggregates can be exposed to

26

the components of BBOA when wildfire plumes cross the wildland-urban interface (WUI),

27

which may partition to coat the BC. Here, we investigate the effects of laboratory-

28

generated BBOA from pine on BC from an inverted diffusion burner. Initially 200 nm BC

29

aggregates were selected using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and exposed to

30

different volatility fractions of BBOA. These fractions were prepared by evaporative aging

31

in the laboratory, which mimics evaporative aging with transport in the atmosphere, to

32

give fresh, moderately aged, and most aged BBOA. The resulting mobility diameters with

33

and without removal of the coating were determined using a second DMA. We find that

34

an exceedingly small coating volume of fresh (i.e., higher volatility) BBOA causes complete

35

restructuring while a significantly higher coating volume of most aged (i.e., lower

36

volatility) BBOA is necessary for this same extent of restructuring. Our results highlight

37

the importance of evaporative age of BBOA as wildfire plumes are transported across the

38

WUI into urban environments.

1. Introduction

41

Black carbon (BC) aggregates affect air quality as well as the radiative balance of the

42

atmosphere, through interactions with light and clouds.1 BC aggregates are composed of

43

spherical primary particles of elemental carbon arranged in highly branched, fractal

44

morphologies,2,3 which dictate how the particles interact with light. 4,5 BC aggregates may

45

also accumulate coatings that alter these interactions through lensing effects. 6–8 These

46

coatings may induce restructuring of the BC aggregates, resulting in more compact,

47

closely-packed morphologies.9 Coatings that have been observed to induce BC

48

restructuring in laboratory experiments include water,10,11 sulphuric acid,12,13 and

49

secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from a wide range of gaseous precursors: e.g., biogenic

50

isoprene and α-pinene;14–17 anthropogenic benzene,18 toluene,18,19 ethylbenzene,18 and

51

m- and p-xylene,18,20,21 and co-emitted combustion byproducts.22,23 Water is important

52

also for its ability to plasticize solid organic coatings or deliquesce solid inorganic coatings,

53

such that the liquified coatings can go on to induce restructuring.24,25 For some coatings,

54

like water, the mechanism of restructuring is evaporation of the coating; 10,26 for others,

55

the mechanism of restructuring is a combination of condensation and evaporation. 27–29

56

Several models of restructuring have been developed to represent the forces (e.g.,

57

capillary and surface tension) acting on the primary particles in coated BC aggregates. 20,30–

58

32 For initially monodisperse BC, the combination of restructuring and coating has been

59

observed to result in significant absorption enhancement.13,19,33 In the atmosphere,

60

coated BC aggregates occur across a wide range of morphologies, differing the amount of

61

BC (i.e., few or many primary particles), the amount of coating (i.e., thinly or thickly

62

coated), the compactness of the BC (i.e., branched or closely packed), and the distribution

63

of the coating on the BC (i.e., centric or acentric).34–36 This wide range of morphologies

64

further complicates the physical and optical properties of BC.37,38

65

BC is an important component of the urban atmosphere, where it is largely

66

emitted from diesel vehicles.39,40 The initial morphology of BC from diesel engines has

67

been investigated and shown to be highly branched.41–43 Branched aggregates produced

68

from diesel engines in the laboratory have been shown to be compacted upon

69

coating.44,45 Urban BC has also been shown to be coated and compacted in the field. 46–48

70

Nascent, monodisperse BC introduced into an outdoor semi-permeable chamber, where

71

it was exposed to gaseous species in two urban atmospheres, also was coated and

72

compacted.33 The occurrence of BC in the urban atmosphere that is initially largely bare

73

contrasts with BC in wildfire plumes that is initially internally mixed with organic aerosol,

74

called biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA),49 which influences the physical and

75

optical properties of co-emitted BC as described above.50–53 Wildfires have been shown

76

to influence the organic composition of suspended particles and deposited films in the

77

urban environment;54,55 for example, wildfires increase the concentration of polycyclic

78

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the urban atmosphere.55 Several PAHs have been shown

79

to restructure BC aggregates in the laboratory as sub-cooled liquids. 56 Consequently,

80

when wildfire plumes cross the wildland-urban interface (WUI), 57–59 urban BC is exposed

81

to the components of BBOA, which may alter the morphology of the BC aggregates.

82

Furthermore, BBOA is a complex mixture of organic species with wide ranges of physical

83

and chemical properties,60–62 which may influence its interactions with urban BC.

84

Here, we focus on the following hypotheses: first, components of BBOA will

85

partition to form coatings on nascent, highly branched BC aggregates and, in turn, induce

86

restructuring to give a more compact, closely-packed morphology; and, second, the

87

effects of BBOA on BC morphology will depend on the physical properties of this complex

88

mixture, which change during transport in the atmosphere. BC was generated using an

89

inverted diffusion flame, and aggregates with an initial mobility diameter of 200 nm were

90

selected using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA). BBOA was generated by thermal

91

degradation of pine wood in a tube furnace, and filter-collected samples were

92

conditioned by evaporative aging. Monodisperse BC was exposed to conditioned BBOA in

93

a saturator-condenser apparatus, and the resulting mobility diameters with and without

94

thermal denuding were monitored using a second DMA coupled to a condensation

95

particle counter (CPC). Our results and their atmospheric implications are discussed

96

below.

2.1. Generation of black carbon

100

BC was generated using a miniature inverted soot generator (Argonaut) with ethylene as

101

the fuel.63,64 The flowrates of ethylene (Airgas, Ultra High Purity) and air (Airgas, Ultra

102

Zero Grade) were set to 0.1 and 10 L min−1, respectively, using mass flow controllers

103

(Sensirion, SFM5500 Series). The flowrates were verified using a bubble-based calibrator

104

(Sensidyne, Gilibrator 2). As shown in Fig. 1, a small fraction of the output of the soot

105

generator, at a flowrate of 0.3 L min−1, was directed through a denuder with a length of

60 cm, consisting of stainless-steel mesh packed in granular activated carbon (Sigma-

107

Aldrich, SBHL1410). This sample was then sent through two diffusion dryers, the first with

108

a length of 43 cm and the second (TSI, 3062) with a length of 44 cm, both packed with

109

indicating silica gel desiccant (Parker, DRP-14-10B). The conditioned aerosol was then

110

directed to an electrostatic classifier (TSI, 3082), equipped with a 0.0457-cm nozzle

111

upstream of the inertial impactor, a soft X-ray advanced aerosol neutralizer (TSI, 3088),

112

and a long DMA (TSI, 3081). The sample and sheath flowrates of the DMA were 0.3 and 3

113

L min−1, respectively. The DMA voltage was set to select particles with an electrical

114

mobility diameter of 200 nm.

2.2. Generation and characterization of biomass burning organic aerosol

124

BBOA was generated by heating pine wood in a tube furnace (Across International,

125

STF1200), described previously.65,66 A rectangular chip of pine wood was placed at the

126

center of the 5-cm diameter quartz tube that is housed in the furnace. The average mass

127

of pine was about 3.5 g. Air (Airgas, Ultra Zero Grade) was directed through the quartz

128

tube at a flowrate of 1.5 L min−1. The tube furnace was programmed to increase in

129

temperature from 25oC to 400oC in 15 min. At 350oC, the generation of BBOA began, a

130

polycarbonate filter holder (Pall, 1119) was connected to the inlet, and BBOA was

131

collected onto a 47-mm fiber filter (Pall, Emfab). BBOA was collected on the filter for

132

about 1 min. The filter-collected BBOA was then stored in a freezer (Fisher, Isotemp) at

133

−15oC for later use in the coating experiments.

134

In these experiments, BBOA was generated to use as a coating on BC. Three

135

categories of BBOA were used, differing in conditioning, i.e., evaporative aging, and the

136

resulting volatility distribution. In the first category, called fresh, BBOA collected on a filter

137

was used without further conditioning. In the second category, called moderately aged,

138

BBOA on the same filter after the previous experiment was subjected to evaporative

139

conditioning, passing 3 L min−1 of clean, dry air from a zero-air generator (Aadco, 747-30)

140

over the filter in a 250-mL glass bubbler, heated to 60 oC, for 48 h. In the third category,

141

called most aged, BBOA on the same filter after the previous two experiments was

142

subjected to further evaporative conditioning, passing 3 L min −1 of clear, dry air over the

143

filter, heated to 120oC, for 48 h. The heating was performed on a hot plate using a sand

144

bath, in which the bubbler was immersed about 3 cm from the base. Mass losses with

145

each step of conditioning were determined gravimetrically using an analytical balance.

146

Three replicates of this sequence of conditioning were performed.

147

BBOA was characterized in terms of absorptivity using UV-vis spectroscopy of bulk

148

solutions of BBOA extracted into methanol. Spectra were measured for three filter-

149

collected samples, conditioned respectively to give fresh, moderately aged, and most

150

aged BBOA. Each filter sample was placed in a vial containing 10 mL of methanol (Fisher,

151

>99.8%), and the vial was placed on a roller mixer for 15 min at 60 rpm. The filter paper

152

was removed, dried, and weighed to determine the mass concentration of BBOA in each

153

solution. An aliquot of each solution was used in a 1-cm quartz cuvette for spectroscopic

154

measurements via a modular fiber-optic-based spectrometer, which consists of a

155

balanced deuterium-halogen light source (Ocean Optics, DH-2000-BAL), a cuvette holder

156

with lenses (Thorlabs, CVH100), and a grating-based spectrometer (Ocean Insight, Flame-

157

T-UV−vis).

158
159

2.3. Characterization of particles upon coating

160

BC was coated by passing it over the BBOA collected on filters. The size-selected BC was

161

directed through a clean 250-mL glass bubbler with the selected category of filter-

162

collected BBOA at the bottom (see Fig. 1). The flowrate through the bubbler was 0.3 L

163

min−1. Like above, heating was performed using a sand bath. Here, the temperature was

164

increased incrementally, up to 142oC for the most aged, least volatile category of BBOA.

165

Downstream of the bubbler, which serves as the saturator, the sample was returned to

166

room temperature before being directed through one of two paths, alternately. In the

167

first path, the sample was passed through a 1.8-m thermal denuder, constructed from

168

1/4" copper tubing, as described previously.66,67 The temperature of the thermal denuder

169

was set to 200oC. The particles were then directed to a second DMA, which was equipped

170

the same as the first and operated at the same flowrates, and a CPC (TSI, 3750). The

171

sample flowrate of the CPC is 1 L min−1, so the difference of 0.7 L min−1 was sampled from

172

the laboratory through a particle filter. In the second path, the sample bypassed the

173

thermal denuder. In a control experiment, BBOA was also used to coat spherical

174

monodisperse polystyrene latex particles, and sheath flowrates of 3, 4.5, and 6 L min −1 on

175

the second DMA gave the same mobility diameters for coated particles (see Fig. S1),

176

suggesting that evaporation between the condenser and DMA was insignificant.

177
178

3. Results and discussion

179

The filter-collected BBOA was conditioned by preparatory evaporation, flowing clean, dry

180

air through the filters, to produce BBOA differing in evaporative aging and, in turn,

181

volatility and absorptivity. The mass of fresh BBOA collected on the filters was 110 ± 10

182

mg. After the first step of conditioning, to produce what is here called moderately aged

183

BBOA, 0.61 ± 0.02 of the fresh BBOA mass remained. After the second step of

184

conditioning, to produce the most aged BBOA, 0.33 ± 0.04 of the fresh BBOA mass

185

remained. The fraction remaining for the most aged BBOA closely matches the largest

186

increment used in recent studies of the effects of evaporative aging on the viscosity and

187

absorptivity of BBOA, where this fraction was called PO3 to denote the volume was

188

reduced by a factor of three from that of the initial pyrolysis oil.60,68 This preparatory

189

evaporation mimics in the laboratory the partitioning of BBOA components downwind of

190

a fire,61,69 and is similar to approaches used previously to simulate evaporative aging. 66,70

191

Increased evaporative aging is known to result in decreased BBOA volatility. 60,68 The mass

192

absorption coefficient (MAC; see ESI) of the remaining BBOA also increased with

193

evaporative aging, as shown in Fig. 2 for solutions in methanol. All but 0.1 mg of each

194

sample was soluble in methanol. At 365 nm, MAC was 0.26, 0.57, and 0.73 m 2 g−1 for

195

fresh, moderately aged, and most aged BBOA. The mass of the most aged BBOA is

196

precisely one third that of the fresh, and the MAC at 365 nm of the fresh is just slightly

197

greater than one third that of the most aged. At 405 nm, MAC was 0.07, 0.18, and 0.32

198

m2 g−1 for fresh, moderately aged, and most aged BBOA. The significant increase in MAC

199

with evaporative aging indicates that the most volatile components of BBOA, which

200

partition out of the particle phase, are much less absorptive than the components that

201

remain in the particle phase. This observation is consistent with previous observations for

202

BBOA produced from hardwood pellets and eastern red cedar.60,66 The variable

203

absorptivity of BBOA will result in different effects on the optical properties of BC

204

aggregates upon coating.52,53,71

210

The conditioned BBOA was used to coat BC aggregates, which were first selected

211

by size at a mobility diameter of 200 nm from the polydisperse size distribution

212

characteristic of the burner and combustion conditions.63,63 The miniature inverted soot

213

generator produced a stable size distribution of BC, as shown in Fig. S2. We note that the

214

particles selected at 200 nm occur to the right, i.e., higher mobility diameter, than the

215

geometric mean diameter. This choice of initial diameter ensures that singly charged

216

particles are the most abundant, as opposed to doubly or multiply charged particles with

217

larger dimensions. Monodisperse, size-selected particles were monitored using the

218

second DMA in combination with the CPC, stepping through voltages and measuring the

219

resulting number concentration. Representative size spectra are shown in Fig. S3.

220

Changes in morphology upon coating and restructuring were determined by monitoring

221

the monodisperse particles. Each size spectrum was fit to a lognormal peak. The center

222

of the peak was used to quantify the change in mobility diameter, and the geometric

223

standard deviation was used to ensure the particles remained monodisperse. 72,73

224

A representative coating experiment with the moderately aged BBOA is shown in

225

Fig. 3b, in terms of the mobility diameters of both denuded (i.e., coated−uncoated) and

226

non-denuded (i.e., coated) particles as a function of the saturator temperature. The

227

experiment can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, between 20 and 50 oC, the

228

denuded and non-denuded particles exhibited the same morphology as the initial size-

229

selected aggregates. For these saturator temperatures and this BBOA volatility fraction

230

(i.e., moderately aged), the vapor pressures of the components were too low to result in

231

partitioning onto the BC. During the second stage, between 50 and 70 oC, the mobility

232

diameters of both classes of particles began decreasing. The denuded particles decreased

233

in diameter throughout this stage, until they approached a plateau for the final, fully

234

restructured aggregates, resulting in a sigmoidal curve. The non-denuded particles (i.e.,

235

with coating intact) also decreased in diameter initially during this stage, demonstrating

236

that condensation rather than evaporation is driving most of the restructuring in BBOA-

237

coated BC. This is not the case for all coatings; for example, water is known to cause

238

significant restructuring only upon evaporation, a distinction that may be attributed to

239

whether a coating effectively wets the BC surface or not.10 This observation also

240

demonstrates that the BBOA coating was a liquid. Fresh BBOA has previously been shown

241

to be liquid.62,66 While evaporative aging is known to increase the viscosity of BBOA, 60,74

242

here it was still sufficiently low-viscosity to restructure the aggregates on the

243

experimental timescale, i.e., the residence time between the saturator and the second

244

DMA. The non-denuded particles followed the trend of the denuded particles until a

245

saturator temperature of about 65oC, at which point they diverged, reaching a minimum

246

and beginning to grow. During the third stage of the experiment, between 70 and 110 oC,

247

the mobility diameter of the denuded particles reached its plateau, i.e., the aggregates

248

could not restructure further, no matter how much coating material partitioned onto the

249

BC. The mobility diameter of the non-denuded particles continued increasing, as more

250

material was added to the coating, according to the temperature dependence of the

251

vapor pressures of the BBOA components (i.e., governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron

252

equation).75,76

260

These three stages of evolution are also observed for BC aggregates coated with

261

fresh and most aged BBOA, but the temperatures associated with the three stages are

262

different. For fresh BBOA, the first stage occurs only at very low temperatures. Already at

263

30oC, sufficient BBOA begins to partition to result in some restructuring (see Fig. 3a).

264

Again, the trends for denuded and non-denuded particles overlap, indicating that the

265

restructuring occurs during condensation rather than evaporation of the coating in the

266

thermal denuder. For most aged BBOA, the temperature required for restructuring to

267

begin is about 60oC (see Fig. 3c). For fresh BBOA, the two series overlap for the duration

268

of the second stage of restructuring. It is only when the BC cores are fully restructured,

269

reaching the plateau at the final extent of restructuring, that the two series diverge (see

270

Fig. 3a). In other words, very little coating is required to fully restructure the BC

271

aggregates for fresh BBOA. For most aged BBOA, the two datasets diverge halfway

272

through the second stage of evolution (see Fig. 3c), well before the aggregates are fully

273

restructured, indicating that the coating required to induce complete restructuring is

274

higher for this less volatile fraction of BBOA. During the third stage of the experiments,

275

the exponential increase in mobility diameter of the fully restructured aggregates with

276

coating intact is an indication that these particles were spherical. The fully restructured

277

aggregates without coating are known to be not quite spherical, with mass-mobility

278

exponents (see ESI) of about 2.7-2.8 (i.e., less than the value of 3 expected for

279

spheres),9,18,45 but in an approximation they are taken as spherical here, such that their

280

281

To estimate the volume of coating, we take the difference between the volume of

282

the coated particles and volume of the restructured cores, with coating removed, both

283

calculated according to their respective mobility diameters (see ESI). This difference is

284

shown in Fig. S4 for a representative experiment with the fresh BBOA, the same as

285

depicted in Fig. 3a. The subtraction of volumes assumes spherical geometries, an

286

approximation that is only reasonable after the BC cores approach their final diameter,

287

during the third stage of the coating experiment, described above. Another constraint is

288

that, at the initial saturator temperature, no BBOA partitioning onto BC occurs, so the

289

coating volume is zero at 25oC. Fitting an exponential function, meant to capture the

290

temperature dependence of the vapor pressures of the BBOA components, to these first

291

and third stages of the coating experiment, we obtain the curve shown in Fig. S4. From

292

this fit, coating volume at any temperature can be estimated by interpolation.

293

When the diameter growth factor of the restructured BC aggregates without

294

coating is plotted as a function of the volume growth factor of the aggregates with coating

295

intact (see ESI), differences between the BBOA volatility fractions are further evident. As

296

shown in Fig. 4, fresh BBOA (i.e., without any evaporative conditioning before the coating

297

experiment) induced significant restructuring at very low coating volumes. At a volume

298

growth factor of 1.1 (i.e., when the coating volume is 10% of the initial aggregate volume),

299

the diameter growth factor was already approaching its final value of about 0.70. For

300

moderately aged BBOA, the diameter growth factor at the same volume growth factor is

301

about 0.75. In other words, at the same coating volume, this fraction is less effective at

302

restructuring the BC aggregates than the fresh BBOA. For most aged BBOA, the same

303

volume growth factor of 1.1 leads to a diameter growth factor of only 0.85, about halfway

304

between the initially branched and fully restructured aggregates. To reach the plateau for

305

completely restructured BC aggregates with most aged BBOA, the coating volume must

306

approach 100% of the initial aggregates volume, ten times greater than for fresh BBOA.

315

How can these differences between the volatility fractions of BBOA in terms of

316

their ability to induce restructuring of BC aggregates be rationalized? Based on their study

317

of pure liquid coatings, Chen et al. proposed a single-parameter framework of soot

318

aggregate restructuring.30 The single parameter, 𝜒, is expressed as follows:

319

𝜒=

𝑙 1
𝑅 𝜁

320

where 𝑙 is the Kelvin length, 𝑅 is the radius of the spherical primary particles, and 𝜁 is

321

the reduced (i.e., dimensionless) vapor supersaturation of the coating species. In our

322

experiments, the conditions were carefully controlled to give the same initial aggregate

323

morphology,45 so the value of 𝑅 is expected to be consistent between experiments. The

324

Kelvin length varies with the surface tension of the coating species; however, this effect

325

is smaller than the effect of volatility, through changes in 𝜁.20,30 When 𝜒 is much less than

326

unity, the coating partitions uniformly across the surface of the soot aggregates; when 𝜒

327

approaches unity, the coating partitions preferentially into the junctions between

328

neighbouring primary particles, i.e., constituent spherules of the aggregates. 30 By volume,

329

coatings following this latter pathway are more effective at inducing restructuring of BC

330

aggregates. As volatility increases, 𝜒 increases, as well. Consequently, pure high-vapor-

331

pressure coatings (e.g., triethylene glycol and tetradecane) caused aggregates to

332

restructure to their final morphology already at mass growth factors of less than 1.1. In

333

contrast, pure low-vapor-pressure coatings (e.g., dioctyl sebacate and oleic acid) caused

334

aggregates to restructure only partially at the same mass growth factors, a few percent

335

opposed to the final diameter growth factor of 0.80 observed for the high-vapor-pressure

336

coatings. Note the final extent of restructuring is highly dependent on the initial

337

morphology of the soot aggregates, including the size and number of primary particles, 45

338

so it is not surprising that the final diameter growth factor in our experiments, about 0.70,

339

is different than those reported in the earlier study with pure liquid coatings. More

340

importantly, the relationship between coating volatility and its distribution on the BC

341

aggregates allows us to rationalize our current results: fresh BBOA components on

342

average have higher vapor pressures than evaporatively aged BBOA components, so they

343

partition preferentially in the junctions between primary particles, inducing complete

344

restructuring with little volume.

345
346

4. Atmospheric implications

347

Our results have broad implications on the interactions between BBOA from wildland fires

348

and BC from urban sources at the WUI. Each volatility fraction of BBOA induced

349

restructuring of BC aggregates upon partitioning, with the coating intact, demonstrating

350

that compaction occurs without coating evaporation. This observation stands in contrast

351

with restructuring induced by water, which requires evaporation, 10 and it is an important

352

feature of the interactions between BBOA and BC, since many BBOA components, with

353

lower volatilities, would not be expected to partition from the coated aggregates back

354

into the gas phase. The restructuring induced by the most aged BBOA also demonstrates

355

that even the most viscous volatility fraction acts as a liquid in the internally mixed

356

particles.24,56 Furthermore, the differences observed between the fresh, moderately

357

aged, and most aged BBOA demonstrate that volatility largely governs the impact of BBOA

358

coatings on BC aggregate morphology. Fresh BBOA, emitted from wildfires near the WUI,

359

is most effective at restructuring BC aggregates; i.e., coating volumes as little as 10% of

360

the initial BC volume are sufficient to induce complete restructuring of BC aggregates to

361

their final, most closely-packed morphology. As the evaporative age of BBOA increases,

362

for emissions of wildfires at increasing distances from the WUI, the BBOA becomes less

363

effective at inducing soot restructuring. For the most aged BBOA investigated here, 33%

364

by mass of the initial BBOA, coating volumes about 100% of the initial BC volume (i.e.,

365

doubling the total particle volume) are required to induce complete restructuring of BC

366

aggregates to their final morphology. Not only is more coating required, less BBOA (i.e.,

367

primary) material is available to partition upon dilution of the plume of wildfire

368

emissions.61,69 This dependence on BBOA volatility can be rationalized in the context of

369

the single-parameter framework of soot restructuring;30 by volume, less fresh BBOA is

370

required for complete restructuring because this material partitions preferentially into

371

the junctions between neighbouring BC primary particles, whereas aged BBOA partitions

372

more uniformly across the BC aggregate surface. This application of the single-parameter

373

framework to complex mixtures of atmospherically relevant organic species, specifically

374

those emitted from wildland fires, further emphasizes the utility of this framework. 30 As

375

wildfires continue to increase in frequency and severity in many regions,77,78 wildfire

376

plumes of BBOA are more likely to interact with urban BC at the WUI. The morphology of

377

coated BC aggregates influences their interactions with solar and terrestrial radiation,

378

water vapor, and the respiratory tract, so these volatility-dependent impacts on

379

morphology will influence the effects of BC on human health through climate and air

380

quality.
