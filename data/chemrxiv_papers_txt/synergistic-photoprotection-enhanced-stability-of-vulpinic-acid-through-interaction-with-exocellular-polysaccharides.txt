Abstract
Lichens have been of great interest in exobiological studies due to their remarkable tolerance to
ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These organisms employ extracellular pigments for screening high-energy
solar radiation, allowing the photosynthetically active radiation to pass through and be utilized by the
photosymbiont. These pigments are found co-occurring within polysaccharide scaffolds in the lichen

cortex. Despite extensive studies on isolated lichen pigments, the potential role of exopolysaccharides
(EPS) in the photoprotective system of lichens has remained unclear. We report detailed photophysical
studies on the wolf lichen pigment vulpinic acid in pullulan, a polysaccharide that mimics lichen EPS.
Solid phase studies demonstrate that the pigment’s photostability is greatly enhanced in the pullulan
polysaccharide matrix. Analysis of ultrafast transient absorption infrared spectroscopy indicates potential
interactions of the polysaccharide inhibiting the relaxation pathway of vulpinic acid upon UV
photoexcitation. These polysaccharides interrupt an intramolecular proton transfer that traditionally leads
to photodecomposition of the isolated vulpinic acid compound. These results suggest a crucial role of EPS
in the photoprotective systems of lichens. The interaction between vulpinic acid and pullulan exemplifies
a non-spectator role of polysaccharides in photoprotection, potentially contributing to the extraordinary
resilience of lichens and cyanobacteria. This polysaccharide-pigment interaction may represent a general
strategy among extremophiles to mitigate UV-induced damage, highlighting the importance of
interdisciplinary approaches in unraveling complex biological systems.

Introduction
Protection from excessive solar radiation—broadly termed photoprotection—is relevant for any
lifeform that is exposed to sunlight. It is especially important for photosynthetic organisms as they
inevitably need to harvest solar radiation while experiencing diurnal and annual variations in solar
irradiance. Among several photoprotective strategies found in nature, optical screening-based
photoprotection is a hallmark of photosynthetic organisms as screening pigments are ubiquitously found
in them.1 Such photoprotective systems employ screening pigments as an optical filter to prevent high
energy UV radiation from entering the cell.2 Lichens—the symbiotic association between fungi and algae
or cyanobacteria—are some of the most stress tolerant organisms on Earth and exhibit the extreme form
of this photoprotection. Lichens synthesize a wide array of UV screening compounds and can accumulate
very high quantities of sunscreen pigments in their outer cortex.3, 4 These cortical lichen pigments play a

major role in the superior UV tolerance in lichens.3, 4 This, along with desiccation and photooxidative
damage tolerance, has made lichens model organisms for studying survivability in outer space and early
Earth-like conditions.5-7
A notable aspect of lichen UV screening pigments is their localization in the outer cortex along with
polysaccharides.8, 9 Although this polysaccharide matrix is known to play a role in desiccation tolerance
in these organisms,10 its potential involvement in lichen photoprotection has not been studied. Coexistence
of UV absorbing pigments and polysaccharides in the lichen cortex provides a strong reason for such an
investigation (Figure 1). Polysaccharides are expected to provide hydrogen bonding interaction to the
pigment molecules. Such interactions have been shown to affect the stability of DNA and its ability to
dissipate UV energy efficiently through double hydrogen transfer between the guanidine-cytosine base
pair,11, 12 suggesting that cortex polysaccharide may play a role in lichen photoprotection.

photoprotectant.13, 14,15 The fungal polysaccharide pullulan (Pu) was utilized to mimic lichen cortex
polysaccharide environment. Solid phase photostability studies on VA-pullulan (VA-Pu) composite films
showed a remarkable enhancement in photostability compared to isolated pigment films, implying that
the polysaccharide is possibly an active component of the lichen exocellular photoprotective system.
Ultrafast transient absorption IR spectroscopy was performed to elucidate the nature of the VA-Pu
interaction on short timescales. The results showed direct involvement of the polysaccharide in the
excited-state processes of VA. We employed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations to evaluate the photochemical consequences and excited state
features of VA and VA-Pu systems. Based on these investigations, a mechanistic hypothesis is presented
where phototautomerism of vulpinic acid is discussed in the presence and absence of a polysaccharide.
The hydrogen bonding network and proton-rich environment of the polysaccharide matrix is strongly
implicated in the photostability enhancement of vulpinic acid in pullulan. Studying such synergistic
interactions will help us understand biological processes in early-Earth conditions and guide us in
exobiological studies.

Results and discussion
Enhancement of Vulpinic acid Photostability in a Polysaccharide Matrix
Solid phase photostability studies were performed on vulpinic acid (VA) in distinct chemical
environments to uncover different photophysical aspects of light screening by the cortical lichen pigment.
To investigate the role of exopolysaccharides in the photoprotective activity of vulpinic acid, its
photostability was tested in three different forms: isolated vulpinic acid (VA), vulpinic acid in βcyclodextrin complex (VA-β-CD), and vulpinic acid-pullulan composite (VA-Pu). All studies were
performed in solid phase to better mimic the extracellular photoprotective system in lichens. The vulpinic
acid in β-cyclodextrin encapsulation complex was expected to eliminate bimolecular interaction of

vulpinic acid molecules and provide a physical environment similar to a polysaccharide. Finally, a
composite film consisting of vulpinic acid crystals dispersed in the fungal polysaccharide pullulan was
utilized to mimic the physical and chemical environment in a lichen cortex.

Figure 2: Photodegradation curves of vulpinic acid (black), vulpinic acid-β-cyclodextrin complex (red) and
vulpinic acid-pullulan composite film (blue) along with fits of time constants of decay, τ from their single
exponential fit of the form y = Ae-x/τ + y0. The photodegradation curve for VA-pullulan film over an extended
timescale is shown in the inset.

Thin films of each of these samples were irradiated at 400 nm and changes in their optical densities
were periodically measured at 400 nm (see UV-Vis spectra in Figure S1). β-cyclodextrin and pullulan are
both transparent in this wavelength range. The decays are fit to a single exponential to extract a time
constant τ for each system (Figure 2). These time constants indicate the rate of degradation of the pigment
in each system and hence is a measure of photostability of the pigment. The values of these time constants
are 79.71 ± 22.57 (VA), 120.09 ± 58.21 (VA-β-CD), and 787.81 ± 211.36 (VA-Pu) in minutes. The largest
contribution to the standard deviation in the measurements arises due to the unevenness of the film

distribution on the quartz plate. The higher time constants indicate slower rates of pigment degradation.
To account for any differences in the power of the irradiation source, the time constants were expressed
as decay constants with units of total number of incident photons (shown in Figures S2). VA-β-CD showed
a 50% enhancement in photostability compared to isolated VA. β-cyclodextrin encapsulation has been
found to enhance the photostability of various sunscreen pigments.16-19 Encapsulated VA molecules are
expected to undergo unimolecular photodegradation processes, so the overall enhancement of the decay
time of VA-β-CD is likely a result of β-cyclodextrin providing a competing vibrational relaxation scaffold
to excited state of VA molecules assuming VA and VA- β-CD have similar mechanisms of dissipation.
The decay time of vulpinic acid in a pullulan composite film (VA-Pu) was found to be an order of
magnitude higher than the isolated VA film. This signifies that photodegradation of vulpinic acid in
pullulan happens at a rate an order of magnitude lower compared to its isolated crystalline form. Overall,
these results illustrate that the degradation times are significantly influenced by interactions between the
pigment and its local chemical environment, accentuating the involvement of the polysaccharide matrix
in UV protection of lichen organisms. In particular, the local environment acts as a much larger scaffold
for energy dissipation via vibrational relaxation.

FTIR and DFT calculations suggest phototautomerism of vulpinic acid as a major
photochemical outcome
Photodegradation of VA films upon long-term irradiation at 400 nm was monitored by periodically
collecting FTIR spectra of the samples to probe structural changes associated with the degradation.
Changes in peak intensities and the emergence of new IR peaks provide insights into the structural changes
induced in VA upon irradiation. Decreasing peak intensities were observed in VA at 1598 cm-1, 1612 cm1

, 1678 cm-1, and 1774 cm-1 (Figure 3). A broad increase was observed between approximately 1685 cm-

1

and 1755 cm-1, which indicates a distribution of multiple products forms upon long-term irradiation. To

interpret the differences between initial and final FTIR spectra, DFT calculations were performed at

B3LYP/def2-SVPD level to compute the geometry and the ground state FTIR spectra. Of the major
isomers of vulpinic acid, VA-T1 was established as the ground state structure by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction (scXRD) of vulpinic acid isolated from Letharia vulpina (Figure 3, Panel B). We found
excellent agreement between the experimental and computed geometries as well as between the FTIR
spectra and DFT calculations, where the VA-T1 isomer was also found to be the lowest energy isomer
(Figure 3, Panel B). When selecting likely photoproducts to evaluate with computational studies,
tautomers and E/Z-isomers of each tautomer of VA were considered. Of these, only E isomer of VA-T2
and the 1,3-dicarbonyl tautomer (VA-CT) strongly resembled the experimental observations (Figure S7).
VA-T2 showed emergence of absorption between 1690 cm-1 and 1760 cm-1 and an overall decrease in
peak intensities in the 1500-1680 cm-1 range when compared to VA-T1 spectrum, supporting that the VAT2 isomer of vulpinic acid is a major photoproduct of vulpinic acid in the solid phase upon continuous
irradiation.

minimal change in the molecular geometry. However, it is unlikely to happen through a single-step
unimolecular process in vulpinic acid due to unfavorable geometry for a proton transfer from the enol OH
to the lactone carbonyl (Figure 3). Solvent-assisted proton transfer between the two centers may be
possible. In the absence of solvent-mediated interactions, it is reasonable to assume that tautomerization
of VA happens through a more complex, multi-step process; presumably through formation of one or more
intermediates, such as the C-tautomer (VA-CT).20, 21
FTIR photodegradation studies were also performed on a VA-Pu film, which showed similar
spectral changes upon irradiation (Figure S3). The VA-Pu system was modeled in DFT calculations by
placing two methanol molecules on either side of a VA molecule, providing relevant hydrogen-bonding
interactions (Figure S6). The similarities in spectral features between these two systems (Figure 3 and
Figure S3) suggest that VA forms same/similar photoproducts in presence or absence of pullulan. The
vastly different time constants of decay in the photodegradation studies (Figure 2) indicate that the
products form at different rates, signifying involvement of different photochemical steps/processes
between the two systems (or similar processes happening at slower rates).

Transient Absorption IR spectroscopy and TD-DFT calculations reveal excited-state
features and key differences in relaxation pathway of VA in polysaccharide
Since photoexcited processes typically unfold within picosecond or even shorter timescales,
theoretical investigations utilizing electronic structure computations are indispensable for elucidating the
comprehensive mechanism, which often involves several relaxation pathways.22-25 The dynamics of the
vulpinic acid and VA-pullulan systems on short (picosecon d) timescales were evaluated using transient
absorption spectroscopy and TD-DFT calculations. Our transient absorption IR experiments highlighted
significant changes in kinetic traces of the transient spectra, revealing differences in the excitationrelaxation mechanisms of VA (Figure 4, Panel A) and VA-Pu composite film (Figure 4, Panel B). The

combination of a 400 nm pump pulse and broadband IR probe pulse allowed for the examination of the
excited-state IR spectrum between 1500-1750 cm-1 at delay times ranging from a hundred femtoseconds
to 3 nanoseconds. Several absorption and bleach signals appear shortly after time zero in each of the
systems. Some of the prominent signals that appear in both VA and VA-Pu include the transient
absorptions near 1716 cm-1 and 1575 cm-1, and the bleach around 1600 cm-1 (Figure 4, Panels A and B).
A comparison of the transient absorption spectrum at 2 ps and steady-state difference FTIR spectrum
(spectrum before irradiation subtracted from spectrum after irradiation) is provided for both VA and VAPu in Figure S4. As shown, there is little overlap between the short-timescale transient and the long
timescale FTIR difference spectra. These results suggest the presence of photochemical processes which
lead to intermediate structures that are not present in the final photoproducts, i.e. long-lived intermediates,
which may include structures resembling the various tautomers of VA.

agreement with the transient absorption spectra from experiments. The calculated optimized geometries suggest an
excited-state intramolecular proton transfer event in vulpinic acid upon excitation (right). Panel D: Tentatively
assigned structural changes observed on the picosecond timescale that are supported by TD-DFT calculations
indicating the relevance of a proton transfer event in both VA and VA-Pu.

Examining the kinetic traces of prominent signals in the transient absorption spectra reveals specific
structural rearrangements occurring upon irradiation. TD-DFT calculations of the excited state of the VAT1 isomer support that the bleach signal at 1598 cm-1 for VA represents the alkene of the butenolide
resulting from the initial intramolecular-excited state proton transfer (ESPT) to the ester carbonyl,
occurring with a time constant of 1.5 ps (Figure 4). The traces of two positive-going signals (1582 cm-1
and 1716 cm-1) represent the subsequent intermediate steps within the intramolecular-ESPT. The 1582 cm1

decaying signal (~1.9 ps) corresponds to the formation of an excited state (S1) intermediate while the

1716 cm-1 decaying signal (~2.3 ps) represents the formation of the carbonyl (Figure 4) upon further
migration of the proton. The bleach signal at 1600 cm-1 persists for longer than 3 ns without decaying
(Figure S5). All signals reach their largest magnitudes in approximately 0.5-1 picoseconds, which is
around the timescale corresponding to a typical intramolecular proton transfer. 26, 27
Both systems show broadly similar transient absorption signal changes with the major differences being
in the time constants of the kinetic traces observed at ~1575 cm-1 and 1716 cm-1, suggesting differences
in their excited-state intermediate lifetimes and relaxation pathways (Figure 4). For the VA-Pu positive
signal at 1570 cm-1 the time constant is 10.6 ps, which is five times larger than that for the analogous peak
in VA (Figure 4, Panel B). A more drastic difference is observed for the absorption at 1716 cm-1. The time
constant for this decaying signal is 53.2 ps, which is over twenty times larger than the time constant at this
frequency for VA. These significant increases in the time constants strongly suggest the involvement of
pullulan in kinetic trapping along the relaxation pathway of the excited state of VA, inhibiting the
pathways associated with intermediate structure through external hydrogen bonding that interrupts the
intramolecular hydrogen bond in VA-T1.

Conclusion and overall mechanistic scheme
Our study presents compelling evidence for the active participation of polysaccharides in the
photoprotection system of lichens, as demonstrated by the significant enhancement of vulpinic acid (VA)
photostability in a pullulan matrix. The observed ~10-fold increase in photostability of VA in the pullulan
composite film compared to isolated VA emphasizes the non-spectator role of the polysaccharide in the
photophysical processes and photostability of the pigment. Transient absorption infrared spectroscopy,
coupled with DFT and TD-DFT computational studies, reveals key differences in potential relaxation
pathways of VA when embedded in a polysaccharide matrix that underscore the observed dramatic
increase in photostability of VA in a pullulan film. As a neat film of VA, computational and transient
absorption IR methods support an intramolecular-ESPT from the enol to the methyl ester. In other
established sunscreen systems, such as benzophenones and hydroxyanthroquinones, the intramolecularESPT followed by relaxation to a tautomeric form has been established as the main mode of radiationless
decay to the ground state.28 29-35 However, in the case of VA, there are significant geometric impediments
to relaxing to the other stable tautomeric products (VA-T2 and VA-CT) through a proton transfer event
and would require external proton donors or acceptors to complete this proton transfer. It is likely that the
highly reactive excited state provides a significant source of degradation through participating in
irreversible reactions in the neat VA film. However, in the presence of the polysaccharide pullulan, this
pathway can be interrupted, allowing for efficient tautomerization to the VA-T2 isomer either after
intramolecular ESPT or through an intermolecular ESPT.36-39 While the limitations of our computational
approaches prevent the accurate modeling of the excited state of the VA imbedded in pullulan,
computational evaluation of VA with two discrete methanol molecules supports that the intramolecular
hydrogen bond can be interrupted in the ground state without significant energetic penalties (Figure S6).
It is likely to change the intramolecular-ESPT to a transition that is described more as a conformational
twist than the proton transfer computed from the TD-DFT calculations of the un-solvated system.40

Moreover, comparisons of the lifetimes of key vibrational modes strongly suggests that proton transfer,
whether intramolecular or intermolecular, is occurring in both the VA and VA-Pu films (bleaching at
1600/1606 cm-1). However, the relaxation lifetimes and pathways are significantly different, especially
with respect to the vibrational mode corresponding to the carbonyl that would be developing upon
tautomerization to a structure resembling VA-T2 [VA (neat) 1716 cm-1 t = 2.3 ps vs. VA-Pu t = 53.2 ps,
Figure 4].
Given these results we propose a mechanistic scheme whereby an excited state proton transfer results
from the absorbance of a photon by VA (Figure 5). In the case of the neat VA, the strong intramolecular
hydrogen bond enforces an intramolecular-ESPT to the ester carbonyl.39, 41 This reactive product most
likely relaxes back to the ground state through back proton transfer followed by internal conversion;
however, it is susceptible to irreversible photoreactions leading to the observed photodegradation. When
VA is imbedded in the polysaccharide pullulan (VA-Pu), the intramolecular H-bond could be interrupted
which upon excitation undergoes an intermolecular proton transfer eventually relaxing to VA-Pu-T2,
which can revert to the thermodynamically favored VA-Pu-T1 tautomer. This efficient photocycle,
enabled by the polysaccharide, prevents significant photodegradation that would otherwise occur through
the intramolecular-ESPT pathway. The mechanistic insight gained by our results highlights the critical
role of exopolysaccharides in the extracellular photoprotective systems of lichens and possibly other
extremophiles. By switching the major relaxation pathway from intramolecular-ESPT to intermolecularESPT/tautomerization, the polysaccharide matrix not only enhances the photostability of the pigment but
also facilitates a sustainable photoprotective cycle. This study thus highlights the evolutionary significance
of polysaccharide-pigment interactions in natural photoprotection systems, providing a deeper
understanding of the resilience mechanisms in extremophiles and offering potential strategies for
developing bio-inspired UV protection solutions.

VA-Pu-T2

Figure 5: Overall mechanistic scheme supported by the results of this study. VA undergoes an intramolecular
excited state proton transfer to the ester carbonyl in the absence of an external proton donor-acceptor. The VA-Pu
complex can maintain a stabilizing photocycle by interrupting this process and/or quenching the resulting
intramolecular excited state proton transfer product leading to rapid conversion to VA-Pu-T2, which can reequilibrate to the more stable VA-Pu-T1 isomer in the ground state.

Methods and Materials
Extraction, purification and characterization of vulpinic acid
Letharia vulpina was collected from the bark of Douglas fir trees at Yuba Pass (Yuba Pass, CA,
39°37′03″N 120°29′24″W, elevation: ~6,700 ft). Vulpinic acid was readily extractable from Letharia
vulpina thallus with 100% methanol. Large-scale extraction was done by repeated overnight extractions
of dry, ground sample in the solvent with continuous stirring. Extracts were combined and concentrated
in rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) and filtered through Whatman

Grade 2 filter paper. The filtrate was partitioned through silica plug by subsequent elution with DCM and
MeOH until individual fractions ran colorless. The DCM fraction was dark olive green in color and
contained vulpinic acid. This fraction was dried in vacuo at room temperature. Vulpinic acid was
recrystallized from this fraction using 3:4 ethyl acetate:hexane mixed solvent to yield chartreuse yellow
crystals. Two recrystallizations yielded 4.724 g purified vulpinic acid from 100 g dry biomass. Identity of
the compound was confirmed by 1HNMR (Agilent PremiumCompact+ 500 MHz), single crystal X-ray
diffraction (100(±1) K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation, λ =
0.71073 Å) and mass spectrometry (Agilent 1200 HPLC with DAD coupled to Agilent 6230 TOF mass
spectrometer; m/z = 323.0924), all of which conformed to previously published reports of characterization
(SI).

UV-Vis and FTIR Photodegradation
Thin films of isolated vulpinic acid (VA) were prepared by dissolving VA in acetone, depositing the
solution on a quartz plate, and allowing the solvent to evaporate. The maximum optical density at 400 nm
of all films were kept to approximately 0.2 OD to ensure that optical density measurements remained
within the linear regime.
To prepare films of VA in β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), VA molecules were first encapsulated in β-CD.
Encapsulation was achieved by dissolving β-CD and VA in d6-DMSO maintaining a 12.12 mM β-CD
concentration and 1:1 stoichiometry with a slight excess of VA. The solution was stirred for a total of 72
hours, the first 5 hours being at 65-80 °C and the remaining 67 hours being at room temperature. The
solvent was evaporated on a lyophilizer. Encapsulation of VA in β-CD was confirmed by 1HNMR
spectroscopy with significant change in chemical shifts of VA aromatic resonances following previously
published method.42 The FTIR absorption bands of VA also changed upon encapsulation. A thin film of

the encapsulated VA was then prepared in a similar manner to the isolated compound using water as the
solvent.
VA-pullulan films were prepared by first dry-grinding VA crystals and pullulan granules in a mortar to
get a powder mixture (1:10 VA:pullulan, w/w). This mixture was then wet-ground in deionized water
(1:20 pullulan:water, w/w). Pullulan readily forms a viscous solution in water at this concentration. VA
particles appear to be well dispersed in this solution when visualized under 10x magnification. This
solution was then deposited on a quartz plate and briefly placed in a 100°C oven to facilitate the removal
of water.
The films were irradiated with 400 nm light, which was generated by frequency-doubling the 800 nm
output of a Ti:sapphire laser (pulse width 100 fs, repetition rate 1 kHz). The energy of each pulse was on
the order of 30 µJ and the irradiated area was approximately 3 cm2. These parameters make the irradiation
intensity significantly higher than what would be found in a natural environment, which serves to reduce
the total time needed to observe the photodegradation of the sample. Throughout the irradiation process,
spectra of the films were collected on a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
Films of isolated VA and VA in pullulan were prepared for FTIR photodegradation experiments in a
similar manner. CaF2 plates were used as the substrate and the maximum optical density between 15001800 cm-1 was approximately 80 mOD. Irradiation of the films was carried out using the same setup as in
the UV-Vis experiments, and FTIR spectra were collected periodically with a nitrogen-purged Nicolet
6700 spectrometer.

Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Visible-pump IR-probe transient absorption spectra of isolated VA and VA in pullulan were collected
by utilizing a 400 nm pump (1-7 μJ per pulse) and a broadband IR probe spanning approximately 15001750 cm-1. This broadband IR pulse with center wavelength 6203 nm was generated by directing a portion
of the 800 nm output (~100 fs pulsewidth) of a Ti:sapphire laser into an optical parametric amplifier and

converted to the mid-IR via difference frequency generation. The delay between the pump and probe
pulses was controlled by moving a retroreflector in the pump beam path with a motorized nanomover
stage. The transmitted probe pulse was focused onto the focal plane of a monochromator equipped with a
64-element mercury-cadmium-telluride array detector (InfraRed Associates, Stuart, FL).

The

monochromator (focal length 270 mm) used a 50 lines per mm groove grating. Picosecond time dependent
spectra were obtained by sampling the frequency spectra (averaged over 3-5 scans, 900 shots per scan) at
various time points from 0 ps to 25 ps and at additional timepoints of 1, 2, and 3 ns. The VA films were
prepared similarly to the FTIR experiments but were made thicker in order to increase the transient
absorption signal. Several time-delay scans were collected and averaged for each sample.

Computational details
Equilibrium ground state geometries and Hessians of four isomers of vulpinic acid namely VA-T1, VAT2, their Z-isomers VA-T1z and VA-T2z, as well as the 1,3-dicarbonyl tautomer (VA-CT) were computed
at B3LYP/def2-SVPD level of density functional theory (DFT) (Figure S6). Additionally, we investigated
the properties of the VA-T1 and VA-T2 isomers coordinated with methanol molecules to simulate a Hbonding network. Excited state absorption spectra, equilibrium geometries and Hessians were calculated
with the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the same density functional and basis
set. All optimized geometries exhibit absence of imaginary frequencies, except for the first excited state
of the VA-T1•2MeOH isomer with one small imaginary frequency of 14i cm-1. The calculated frequencies
are adjusted with an anharmonicity scaling factor of 0.964. The calculations were performed in the gas
phase with the Q-Chem 5.0 electronic structure program package.43 A vibrational mode decomposition
analysis of the calculated IR spectra is performed using the VibAnalysis code.44 Due to the current lack
of interface between VibAnalysis and Q-Chem, vibrational frequencies for selected isomers are
recalculated with the ORCA 5.0 program package at the same level of theory.45
