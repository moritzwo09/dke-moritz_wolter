Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of indoor air quality and the role of
airborne transmission in disease spread. Heightened public awareness led to an increase in the
commercialization and use of air cleaners. While several of these devices effectively disinfect the
air, some also initiate chemical reactions that can worsen indoor air quality by generating ozone
(O3) and other harmful air pollutants. Here we demonstrate the use of a catalyst to mitigate both
air cleaner-generated and ambient pollution in a real indoor environment. We deployed two
real-time chemical ionization mass spectrometers alongside a suite of air quality analyzers to
measure a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), other trace gases, and particles.
We show the reduction of many indoor pollutants, including O3, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde,
and other oxidized VOCs. We observe an increase in the concentrations of more reduced VOCs
with catalyst use. We demonstrate that over 16 weeks of continuous operation, the clean air
delivery rate of the catalyst for O3 pollution declined linearly by 12.5%. These findings suggest
that employing a dedicated catalyst could reduce indoor air pollution and enhance the human
health benefits of air cleaners by minimizing the associated indoor air quality risks.

1.​ Introduction
Air pollution has been established as the second-leading risk factor for death worldwide,
resulting in 8.1 million deaths in 2021.1 People spend about 90% of their time indoors, where
concentrations of some air pollutants are often considerably higher than typical outdoor
concentrations.2-3 Thus indoor environments play a primary role in human exposure to air
pollution.4 Exposure to gas-phase ozone (O3), a common air pollutant, is associated with a range
of negative health effects and increased mortality.5-7 Notably, current evidence does not support a
safe level of O3 exposure.5,8 Beyond its direct health impacts, exposure to both transient and
stable oxidation products from O3-initiated indoor chemistry (e.g., formaldehyde (HCHO),
carbonyls, peroxides, ozonides) are an important human health concern.9-12 The formation of
secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a very harmful pollutant, represents a key group of stable
compounds produced by O3-driven chemistry indoors.13-15 Formed SOA often consists of
particles in the ultrafine (<0.1 μm) and fine (0.1-2.5 μm) size ranges (PM2.5), which have
stronger health effects per unit mass than O3 itself.15-17 Indoor concentrations of O3 and PM2.5 are
often correlated to outdoor levels since they enter the indoor environment through infiltration
and natural and mechanical ventilation systems.18-20 While few indoor sources of O3 exist, certain
devices like printers, photocopiers, and some air cleaners can generate indoor O3, ultimately
increasing the potential for human exposure to O3 and its indoor chemistry products.20
The COVID-19 pandemic raised global awareness of another important impact of indoor
air quality: the importance of airborne disease transmission for SARS-CoV-2 and other
respiratory pathogens.21-23 The pandemic generated intense interest in air cleaners for air
disinfection that could reduce the spread of airborne diseases indoors.24-25 Some air
cleaning/disinfecting technologies, such as electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and germicidal
ultraviolet at 222 nm (GUV222) lamps, have proven to be effective in disinfecting the air, but
generate O3 as a byproduct.17, 26-30 GUV222 can also generate harmful secondary chemistry
products including oxygenated volatile organic compounds (oVOCs) and SOA in typical indoor
environments.17, 31-34 Other oxidants (e.g., hydroxyl radicals) and HCHO represent additional
common byproducts generated by indoor air cleaners.35-37 Air cleaners are typically operated
continuously in occupied spaces to enhance their effectiveness in reducing airborne transmission,
and as a result, chemical byproducts from these devices may present a notable risk of exposure.38
The removal of indoor air pollutants including O3 and HCHO has been of interest for
decades. Various technologies such as catalytic and photocatalytic decomposition, activated
carbon-based filtration, and passive (i.e., without a flow or fan) removal technologies have
demonstrated O3 removal.39-43 Catalytic treatment of air to remove O3 has been investigated, in
particular through the use of manganese oxide (MnOx)-based catalysts. MnOx catalysts have
garnered high interest owing to higher catalytic activity for O3 removal over other transition
metal oxides, as well as their low cost, environmental friendliness, and good overall stability.39, 42,
44
One concern about this technology is its stability. Catalyst stability is complex and
encompasses alterations in both the catalytic performance and its physicochemical
characteristics. While there are many ways to represent catalyst stability, tracking performance
decline is important for an initial stability assessment without probing degradation mechanisms.45
It is well documented that pure MnOx catalysts suffer from SO2 poisoning and much effort has
been dedicated to overcoming this issue through the modification of MnOx catalysts with mixed
oxides and metal-organic-frameworks, and optimizing catalyst morphology and structures.46-49
With regards to indoor air, previous research on MnOx-based catalysts has focused on the
removal of HCHO considerably more than the removal of O3.50-54 In addition, the application of

MnOx catalysts to real indoor environments remains underexplored, with unresolved questions
about how the presence of other air pollutants might affect catalytic performance and the
possible secondary chemistry products formed.42, 53
In this work, we evaluate the use of a MnOx-based catalyst for the mitigation of indoor air
pollution in both an atmospheric chamber and real office settings. We quantify the removal of
several notable indoor air pollutants including O3, nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), HCHO, and
other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and monitored the catalyst’s effects on a large number
of VOC and oVOC concentrations using two real-time chemical ionization mass spectrometers.
We analyze the catalyst’s durability over 16 weeks of continuous operation. Finally, the ability of
the catalyst to abate O3 pollution generated by an ESP and GUV222 lamps in a real office is
explored.

2.​ Methods
2.1 Catalyst and Air Cleaner Information
The catalyst tested in this work was the PremAir BLD (BASF, China; Fig. S1). The
catalyst consisted of an aluminum honeycomb structure (hexagons of side 1 mm) coated with a
proprietary catalytic coating, which included MnOx according to the manufacturer. The catalyst
was designed for O3 removal from indoor spaces. Two custom-sized catalyst pieces were
obtained and installed in commercial portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air
cleaners, using their built-in fans to drive air flow through the catalyst. A smaller catalyst with
dimensions 105 × 115 × 50 mm (macro-physical internal surface area ~ 0.67 m2) was installed in
a small, “personal” air cleaner (QT3, Smart Air Technology Co. Ltd, China; hereinafter “QT3”)
and used in the chamber and efficiency experiments. The QT3 arrived with a E11 filter and the
catalyst was installed after the filter during all experiments to reduce soiling of the catalyst by
PM (Fig. S2). A larger catalyst (262 × 304 × 30 mm, macro-physical internal surface area ~ 2.65
m2) was installed in a room-sized air cleaner (AC350, Vornado Air LLC, USA; hereinafter
“AC350”) and used in the office experiments. The AC350 arrived with a True HEPA Filter and a
Activated Carbon Filter (Vornado Air LLC). The HEPA and activated carbon filters were
removed from the air cleaner.
Two commercial indoor air cleaning/disinfection methods were tested: an electrostatic
precipitator (ESP) and GUV222 lamps. Both systems produce some O3, and thus their operation
together with the O3 reduction catalyst is of high interest. The ESP was provided by the
manufacturer and consisted of an ionization system with charged wires, a cylindrical metal
collector surface, and pleated filter. The ESP was advertised to remove aerosols and have a flow
of 175 to 300 m3 h-1 depending on the fan speed and operative settings (300 m3 h-1 = 5000 lpm).
Two GUV222 lamps were used, both with the Ushio B1 Far UV-C 222 nm Excimer Lamp
(Ushio America Inc., USA). One was the OSLUV Death Ray 222 nm (The OSLUV Project,
USA) and the other was the FarUV Krypton-36 (Far UV Technologies, Inc., USA).
2.2 Teflon Chamber Experiments
Experiments were conducted in a well-characterized ~ 21 m3 chamber constructed of 50
μm thick FEP Teflon at the University of Colorado-Boulder Environmental Chamber Facility.55-56
Clean air (NOx < 0.2 ppb; VOC < 50 ppb) was supplied to the chamber at 400 lpm using two
AADCO 737-15A clean air generators at slightly positive pressure (1-2 Pa) for several hours

prior to each experiment. The chamber bag was filled until the differential pressure reached 3.5
Pa immediately prior to each experiment. O3 was injected by flowing O2 from a compressed gas
tank (Table S1) and applying voltage to generate corona discharge using a BMT 802 N ozone
generator (BMT Messtechnik GmbH, Germany). NO and NO2 were injected from compressed
gas tanks (Table S1). After each injection, the air in the chamber bag was mixed for about two
minutes with a Teflon-coated mixing fan integrated inside the chamber. The catalyst was
installed inside the chamber within the QT3 and mounted on a ring stand near a bottom corner of
the chamber (Fig. S3).
2.3 Real Office Experiments
The durability of the catalyst was assessed. We aged the smaller catalyst by continuous
operation (i.e., air flow through the material) in the QT3 for 16 weeks. The catalyst was aged in a
university office (“Office A”) typically occupied by five people during working hours.​
Experiments aimed at investigating the indoor air quality impacts of the catalyst in a real
indoor environment were conducted in a ~ 33 m3 university office (4.0 × 2.7 × 3.1 m; “Office
B”) with an entrance door and two windows. The office was carpeted and fitted with typical
office furniture including a desk and chair. To reduce variability from intermittent operation of
the ventilation system, to imitate a low-ventilation situation similar to a home where disinfecting
air cleaners are most impactful, and to increase the signal-to-noise of the measurements, the
vents, windows, and entrance door were sealed with plastic film and/or tape (Fig. S4). Air
change rates (ACRs) were quantified by measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) decay. CO2 from a
compressed air tank (Table S1) was injected into the room and monitored with an Aranet4 sensor
(SAFTehnika, Latvia). A box fan inside the office was turned on remotely for one minute after
each CO2 injection to ensure mixing. Figure S5 shows multiple time series of CO2 decays and
resulting ACRs. ACRs in the office varied from 0.14 h-1 to 0.57 h-1 with a mean of 0.26 h-1
during these measurements. The surface area to volume ratio accounting for contents of the room
was 2.3 m-1. These values are consistent with those previously reported in typical residences and
offices.57-58 The larger catalyst was installed inside the AC350 and placed in the office. Cyclic
on/off operation of the catalyst was conducted in periods of several hours. The on/off operation
allowed repeated chemical changes observed in the office space to be attributed to the use of the
catalyst. The ESP and GUV222 lamps were used during some office experiments. The ESP was
placed in the middle of the indoor office test space without any obstructions near its clean air
output and operated at a constant speed (maximum setting). The two GUV222 lamps were
placed high up in adjacent corners of the office and faced towards the middle of the room. The
average fluence rate in the room was estimated at 2.4 μW cm-2, which is slightly higher than the
upper limit fluence rate in typical installations that comply with the ACGIH limit.17 The catalyst
and air disinfection devices were controlled remotely from outside the office using a PRO Switch
(Digital Loggers Inc., USA).
​
Three office B experiments are described here. These included: (i) a five-day experiment
with six-hour on/six-hour off cycling of the catalyst and (ii) two experiments with continuous
catalyst cycling and an intermediate period of intermittent air disinfection/cleaning device
operation. In the first set of the latter experiments, the catalyst cycled on/off every 4 h for 8 full
cycles and the ESP operated continuously during the middle 4 cycles. In the second set, the
catalyst cycled on/off every 6 h for 8 full cycles and the GUV222 lamps operated continuously
during the middle 4 cycles.

2.4 Instrumentation
​
O3 was monitored using a Thermo Scientific 49i O3 Analyzer during chamber
experiments and a 2BTech Model 205 Dual Beam O3 Monitor during catalyst characterization
and office experiments. Both O3 instruments operate by UV light absorption at 254 nm, and were
zeroed before and after each experiment using a carbon-cap (Whatman Inc., USA). NO and NO2
were monitored using a Thermo Scientific Model 42i-TL TraceLevel NOx Analyzer. The NOx
instrument operates by chemiluminescence and was zeroed with clean chamber air (which has
been shown to have NOx below the detection limit, NOx < 0.2 ppb) and by overflowing the inlet
with ultrahigh purity nitrogen (N2) from a compressed gas tank (Table S1). HCHO was
monitored using a Picarro G2307 cavity ringdown Gas Concentration Analyzer. Particles were
measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS; TSI models: 3080 electrostatic
classifier, 3081 differential mobility analyzer (DMA), and 3776 condensation particle counter).
The system was operated using a 3 L min–1 sheath flow and a 0.3 L min–1 sample flow. The size
distributions were measured every 135 s and the number and volume concentrations were
calculated by integrating over 16-685 nm mobility diameter. The DMA was calibrated with
polystyrene latex spheres. The SMPS data was analyzed using custom software for particle size
distributions in Igor Pro 9 (Wavemetrics, USA).59
2.4.1 Iodide ToF-CIMS
A Chemical Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ToF-CIMS, TOFWERK AG,
Switzerland and Aerodyne Research, Billerica, USA) was used to measure various oxygenated
and nitrogenated VOCs in high resolution with iodide (I-) reagent ions (hereinafter the “I-CIMS”
for short).60 Tofware v4.0.2 in Igor Pro 9 was used for analyzing the I-CIMS data.
Mass-to-charge ratio calibration was performed using 7 ions between m/z 61 and 491 with a
resulting mean residual of 2 ppm. Peaks were assigned elemental formulas and time series
calculations were performed in Tofware by fitting the determined customized peak shape to each
of the assigned m/z values. The data was then normalized to one million total reagent ion [I– +
I(H2O)−] counts per second (cps), which is indicated by the units of normalized cps (ncps). Ion
masses of interest were selected for further processing if they demonstrated variability during
catalyst cycling (also applies for the Vocus processing, section 2.4.2 below). The I-CIMS was
calibrated by injections of formic acid (HCOOH) to the chamber (Fig. S6). HCOOH (Table S1)
was evaporated into the chamber using a glass bulb under N2 flow and slight heat from a heat
gun. As with the O3 and NOx chamber injections, the air in the chamber bag was mixed after
each injection. HCOOH was injected in ~ 5 ppb increments at first and then in a few ~ 10 ppb
increments to yield a calibrated HCOOH concentration range up to ~ 55 ppb. Signals that had
identifiable changes by visual inspection of the catalyst cycles were summed (43 compounds).
The HCOOH sensitivity was assumed for all species and applied to approximate the “bulk
oxidized VOCs” as measured by the I-CIMS. The term bulk was used to mean the total signal
using a single value for sensitivity. It is acknowledged that sensitivities for different species
detected by the I-CIMS can vary by orders of magnitude and thus its bulk concentration is
uncertain. Thus, bulk concentrations were strictly interpreted by focusing on the relative
increases and decreases during air cleaner and catalyst operation.

A Vocus Elf Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (Vocus Elf
PTR-TOF, TOFWERK AG; hereinafter “Vocus” for short) was used to measure VOCs in unit
mass resolution (UMR).61 The instrument is a compact PTR-TOF mass spectrometer. VOCs were
ionized by reactions with H3O+ ions from a discharge and detected in a compact TOF MS with a
mass resolution of 1000 (m/Δm).62 The non-compact version of the instrument has been
described in great detail in a previous publication.63 The Vocus was zeroed using a zero-air
generator and calibrated using a standard calibration gas mixture from Apel-Riemer
Environmental, Inc. (USA) containing several VOCs (acetaldehyde, acetonitrile, acetone,
acrylonitrile, isoprene, methyl ethyl ketone, benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, o-xylene,
α-pinene, phenol, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) every hour during data acquisition. Tofware v3.2.5 in
Igor Pro 9 was used for processing the Vocus data. The m/z scale was calibrated using 6 ions
between m/z 42 and 171 with a mean residual of 31 ppm. Sensitivities were linearly interpolated
between hourly calibrations. For compounds included in the calibration gas mixture, the
sensitivities were determined from the direct calibration. Otherwise, theoretical sensitivities were
calculated using proton transfer reaction (PTR) rate constants (kPTR) from the literature.64-65
Although the Vocus can measure HCHO, owing to a strong humidity dependence, lower
sensitivity, and positive interferences at high O3 levels in PTR-MS, the Picarro measurements
were used exclusively.66-68 Signals that had identifiable changes by visual inspection of the
catalyst cycles were summed (34 VOCs) and a bulk PTR sensitivity was applied to approximate
the “bulk reduced VOCs” as measured by the Vocus. Note that HCHO was not included in the
bulk calculation for either the bulk reduced or oxidized VOCs traces.
2.5 Calculation of Single-Pass Efficiencies and Clean Air Delivery Rates
​
To assess the efficiency of the catalyst, we determined the single pass efficiency (SPE)
and clean air delivery rate (CADR) for pollution removal. SPE quantifies the catalyst’s ability to
reduce the concentration of a pollutant in a specific volume of air that passed through the catalyst
once. Measurements for SPEO3 quantification were taken in an outdoor rooftop laboratory space,
to allow a sufficient and constant background O3 (Fig. S7). SPEs were then computed using Eq.

where O3 out and O3 in were the O3 concentrations immediately downstream and upstream of the

where kX and kO3 were the decay rates of pollutant X and O3 determined during the chamber
experiments and SPEO3 was the result from Eq. (1). Rate coefficients for the loss of O3 and other
pollutants due to catalyst operation or natural decay were calculated using an exponential fit.

CADR (m3 h-1) quantified how efficiently a pollutant present in the test space was
removed by the catalyst, accounting for the volume of the test space and the pollutant decay in
the absence of a catalyst (kdecay, catalyst off).69 CADRs were determined using Eq. (3):

assessment of the catalyst.

3.​ Results and Discussion
3.1 Removal of Ozone, Formaldehyde, and Nitrogen Oxides
The catalyst efficiently removed O3 in all scenarios tested: ambient single-pass,
atmospheric chamber, and indoor office. Results from the catalyst characterization experiments
are summarized in Fig. 1. Figure 1a shows the first order loss of O3 in the Teflon chamber with
catalyst operation. The decay rate and CADR were 2.3 h-1 and 48 m3 h-1, respectively, for the new
catalyst as received (no aging). The O3 decay curves from later experiments show that the ability
of the catalyst to remove O3 slightly decreased with catalyst age. Figure 1b characterizes the
removal of O3 in terms of SPE. SPE ranged from 90.8 to 96.6%, increasing with decreasing fan
speed (at zero weeks of catalyst aging). As the fan speed decreases, the air has more time to
interact with the catalyst material, thus increasing the efficiency. Figure 1c depicts the initial
CADR and its decline with catalyst aging. CADRO3 was 48, 45, and 42 m3 h-1 at 0, 8, and 16
weeks of continuous real-world aging, respectively. Over the sixteen weeks of aging, CADRO3
decreased by about 12.5% in a monotonic trend. At the end of the aging period, verification tests
with the original and a newly purchased QT3 were conducted to ensure that the air cleaner fan or
battery had not aged instead of the catalyst. It was determined that the extended use of the air
cleaner components had made a smaller contribution for the decline in catalyst efficiency (koriginal
QT3 = 1.97 ± 0.03, knew QT3 = 2.05 ± 0.01, uncertainties quoted are 2σ), meaning that at least ⅔ of
the decline was due to the catalyst itself.
Figure 1d shows the removal of O3 and HCHO by the catalyst in office B. During catalyst
operation in the office, rapid and synchronous removal of O3 and HCHO was observed (R2 =
0.91 between their mixing ratios during this experiment). From the decay curves, it can be seen
that O3 and HCHO reached steady-state concentrations in about 1.5 hours (~ 3 and 12 ppb,
respectively). After airflow through the catalyst was stopped, concentrations of both pollutants
increased and approached steady-state.

medium, and high fan speeds,(c) clean air delivery rates at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of catalyst age,
and (d) removal of O3 and HCHO in an indoor office due to operation of the catalyst.
​
To assess the impact of the catalyst on additional indoor air pollutants, chamber
experiments exposing the catalyst to NO and NO2 were performed (Fig. 2). Figures 2a and 2b
show the removal of NO and NO2 in the chamber with catalyst operation. We estimated the SPEs
to be 71.1% and 79.0% for NO and NO2, respectively (for the new catalyst before any aging).
Although aging the catalyst had a limited effect on O3 removal performance, it had a larger
impact on NOx removal. For instance, the decay rate for NO decreased by about 22% after 7
weeks of catalyst aging (k0 = 1.8 h-1 and k7 = 1.4 h-1 where kx represents the decay rate at x
weeks). Catalyst age also impacted the observed products for NO2 removal by the catalyst.
Figure 2c shows that when the catalyst was used to remove ~ 50 ppb of NO2 at 0 weeks aged no
NO formation was observed. In contrast, Figure 2d shows that at 7 weeks of aging the catalyst
removes NO2 and forms NO at an approximate 2:1 ratio. This relationship was confirmed by
several repeats of the experiment at 7 weeks of aging with varying initial NO2 concentrations
(kNO2, 7 weeks = 1.8 to 1.9 h-1) (Fig. S8). It is possible that in both the 0 and 7 week tests NO2 was
converted to NO but during the latter test the NO removal slowed due to the catalyst age which
allowed for NO accumulation. This indicates that although the catalyst persisted in its ability to

reduce O3, NO, and NO2 over weeks of continuous use, it became less efficient over time, with
different rates of aging for different pollutants.

​
Impacts to nitrogen-containing compounds were further examined using the time series
measured by the I-CIMS in office B of several indoor-relevant species including HONO, HNO3,
and N2O5. There were no identifiable changes to HONO or HNO3 when the catalyst cycled. We
did identify a small increase in N2O5 with catalyst operation (Fig. S9). Using previously reported
relative sensitivities of HCOOH and N2O5, we estimated this change in N2O5 to correspond to an
increase on the order of part per quadrillion levels during the 6-hour periods of catalyst use.60

We studied the effect of the catalyst on the removal and formation of VOCs in a real
indoor environment, as exposure to VOCs can be linked to negative health effects.70-71 VOC
levels were monitored in office B while cycling the catalyst on and off. Figure 3a-b shows
averaged difference spectra between the catalyst-off and the catalyst-on periods. The horizontal
dashed lines indicate the signal level above which changes in concentration with catalyst use
were visually discernible in VOC time series (hereinafter the detection limit for changes “DLC”
line for short). Figure 3a (3b) shows that signals of reduced (oxidized) VOCs tended to increase
(decrease) during catalyst operation. Figure 3c shows diurnal variation (averaged over the 5
days) time series for chemical species that showed detectable fluctuations with catalyst use. The
top left panel displays the bulk reduced and oxidized VOC changes with catalyst use, and
highlights the reproducibility and synchronicity of the reduced and oxidized VOC behavior
observed over concurrent cycles. We also included diurnal time series plots for two reduced
VOCs measured in UMR by the Vocus and three oxidized VOCs measured in high resolution by
the I-CIMS. The protonated elemental formulas (and likely compounds) associated with the
reduced VOCs displayed in Fig. 3c are: m/z 79 (C6H7+ from benzene) and m/z 93 (C7H9+ from
toluene). Both reduced VOCs increased on the order of a ppb per 6-hour catalyst activity period
over the five day experiment. In contrast, the displayed oxidized VOCs decreased and changed
more substantially over each 6-hour catalyst-on period. HCOOH decreased on the order of ~ 30
ppb when the catalyst was on (Fig. 3c). Lactic acid (C3H6O3), glycolic acid (C2H4O3), and the
other examined oVOCs above the DLC line followed the same decreasing trend (Fig. 3b-c).

percentiles. The horizontal line markers represent the median values.
​
Some of the prominent reduced VOC species (i.e., above the DLC line) demonstrated
unclear time series variations. This uncertainty was observed in reduced VOC species that are
typically of relevance to indoor air. The changes at m/z 59, 95, and 137, which are typically
associated with acetone, phenol, and α-pinene and other monoterpenes, respectively, did not
show strong variation with catalyst use (Fig. S10). Others (m/z 57, 107, 133) did show a
consistent yet small increase with catalyst use. Importantly, most of these changes in reduced
VOCs were also of a low initial concentration and remained below ~ 4 ppb during repeated
catalyst use cycles. Although not all prominent reduced VOC signals demonstrated consistent
behavior with catalyst operation, the sum of these reduced VOC signals and the medians of the
sum explicitly increased with catalyst use (Fig. S11). We conclude that the catalyst does not
appear to change total VOC concentration, but it does cause changes to the overall VOC
composition. These changes may or may not lead to deteriorated air quality.
3.3 Mitigation of Air Cleaner-Generated Pollution​
Next, we studied the mitigation of pollution generated by two air cleaning / disinfection
methods in office B. The catalyst effectively reduced O3 produced by both the ESP and GUV222
lamps, maintaining O3 concentrations in the office at ~ 3 and ~ 5 ppb during catalyst operation,
respectively (Fig. 4). Figure 4a shows that the ESP generated O3 and substantially reduced
particle number and volume concentrations. Figure 4b shows that the GUV222 lamps generated
O3 and increased particle number and volume concentrations, with new particle formation (NPF)
occurring during the later periods when the GUV222 lamps were on and the catalyst was off.
This indicates that the catalyst was useful in suppressing both NPF and particle mass increases
induced by the GUV222 lamps. Together, these findings suggest that although these disinfection
technologies produce indoor air pollutants, their combined use with a dedicated catalyst helps to
mitigate the generated O3 and PM.

3.4 Implications
The findings of this study demonstrate substantial reductions in key indoor air pollutants
using a catalyst, including O3, HCHO, NO, NO2, PM, and many oVOCs. It is useful to note the
reduction of NO and NO2, which are commonly emitted by gas stoves and other burning

appliances, since alternative indoor air treatment methods like HEPA filters and activated
charcoal do not remove NOx.72 These reductions were observed for both ambient indoor pollution
and pollution generated by air cleaners, with sustained mitigation effects over several months of
continuous use. However, the catalyst's lifespan is not indefinite, and its effectiveness declined at
varying rates for different pollutants. Specifically, the catalyst's ability to remove NOx
deteriorated more rapidly than its ability to reduce O₃ levels. Based on a 12.5% monotonic
decline in the CADRO3 observed over a 16-week aging period, we estimate that the catalyst
would lose its ability to reduce O3 pollution after two years of continuous operation. Therefore,
the catalyst would need to be replaced more often for sufficient performance. Aging tests of
longer duration would be of high interest. For applications where continuous operation is not
required, the catalyst’s lifespan may be extended. It is possible that the aging rate is influenced
by the indoor conditions (e.g. humidity, pollutant concentrations). Observations of NPF from the
application of GUV222 lamps in our indoor office were consistent with findings from previous
indoor air quality studies.31, 73-74 While the cause of GUV222-driven NPF is not understood, NPF
beyond what is expected from ozonolysis chemistry has been observed under realistic indoor
conditions.73 Since implementation of this catalyst was able to suppress NPF events in addition
to removing O3 pollution, the catalyst could reduce the adverse health effects and mortality
associated with air pollution generated by certain air cleaning technologies.
Another important result of this study is that the total impact of the catalyst on VOCs is
complex and requires further investigation. While we successfully measured a relatively wide
range of VOCs, some VOCs like alkanes are not detected with the instruments we used. More
detailed investigation of the fate of individual VOCs upon catalyst processing under varying
conditions would be required to further elucidate overall VOC impacts. Even so, current
understanding is that PM and O3 air pollution have a more significant impact on health endpoints
and a greater number of disease outcomes than VOCs.5, 75-77 We therefore conclude that the
catalyst has an overall positive impact on indoor air quality and human health, especially when
deployed alongside the air disinfection/cleaning methods studied here.
Our results bring attention to the potential advantages of combining technologies to
improve indoor air quality, addressing both chemical and biological concerns. Based on the
presented findings, we suggest that indoor O3 and other common indoor air pollutants can be
effectively mitigated in real indoor settings using a dedicated catalyst. Continued research is
required to evaluate the overall health benefits and risks of different air cleaning and disinfection
technologies. Such research will be crucial for informing regulatory guidelines and standards for
air cleaners and, more broadly, indoor air quality.
