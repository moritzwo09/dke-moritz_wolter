ABSTRACT
Monitoring of microbiological processes in soil is important for understanding and improving
soil health and agricultural productivity. Despite its significance, microbiological measurements
are currently difficult to make in-situ and in real time. Evaluation of microbially-mediated soil
processes usually involves manual sampling followed by laboratory analysis, which can be
costly, time consuming, physically intensive, non-continuous, and reduces capacity for
measuring changes at high temporal and spatial resolution, thereby limiting the ability to make
prompt informed land management decisions. Low-cost soil sensors manufactured using printing
techniques offer a potential scalable solution to these issues, allowing for wide distribution of
sensors that collect time-series data for decomposition rates. Here, we tested the use of novel
sensors for the evaluation of soil microbial processes. This comprises the first large-scale field
deployment of these sensors, which use a biodegradable composite conductor that transduces
microbial decomposition of substrates to a change in electrical resistance. Sensors were installed
for 50 days across 44 experimental plots of a long-term grassland biodiversity restoration
experiment, including treatments with additions of synthetic fertilizer, manure, mixed seed, and
red clover, causing significant differences in soil microbial activity. Soil biological properties
commonly used as soil health indicators, including microbial biomass and enzymatic activities
related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, were measured using standard laboratory
methods. Sensor responses were compared to these conventional soil health measures to better
understand their potential utility by considering the signals of sensors within a set decomposition
window and individual sensor degradation rates across various timescales, and correlating
changes in signal variability with soil measured properties. All statistical approaches found
positive correlations between the sensor signal and laboratory measurements of microbial
biomass carbon and soil organic carbon, and some approaches found correlations with enzymatic
measurements. These findings demonstrate the potential for the proxy measurement of soil
microbial processes in-situ using readily distributable printed decomposition sensors, thereby
supporting their potential for low-cost, high-resolution temporal and spatial monitoring of
complex soil biological parameters and their ability to provide new insights into soil health.

INTRODUCTION
High spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of soils is required to accurately manage soil
resources,1 but currently we have limited capability beyond the monitoring of soil water,
temperature, and some chemical parameters. Continuous monitoring of soil microbiological
activity has, until now, been primarily restricted to measuring soil CO2 concentrations2 and
controlled laboratory or small-scale applications of prototype sensors.3 Real-time monitoring of
soil biological activity would enable precise and sustainable management of this key component
of soil. This is particularly important given the fundamental importance of the soil microbiome
for maintaining soil health and ecosystem functioning.4,5 These functions include nutrient
cycling, decomposition, plant growth, and mediation of soil carbon fluxes due to respiration and
sequestration.6–8 Microorganisms in the soil affect the fate and transport of carbon in the largest
terrestrial carbon pool on the planet.9 In addition, they contribute to critical ecosystem services
from the provisioning of food and safe drinking water to the regulation of pathogenic
organisms.10
Soil health refers to a broad set of metrics and methodologies that relate to a soil’s ability to
provide ecosystem services.11 Soil health indicators are usually broken into three categories:
physical, chemical, and biological,12,13 with biological indicators receiving relatively less
attention in soil health assessments.14,15 This is due, at least in part, to difficulties in both the
measurement and integration of biological parameters into soil health models,16 although there is
broad agreement that more effective soil health models would place greater weight on biological
measurements.17,18 Traditional methods for assessing soil biological properties that are key to
soil health are typically carried out away from the field. This means that they can be expensive
and time consuming, do not provide the benefits of continuous, in-situ monitoring,19 and often do
not differentiate between currently active microbes and relic materials from the microbial
necromass.20 As such, there is a need for better ways to evaluate the biological components of
soil health at scale, including the implementation of continuous monitoring to evaluate changing
trajectories.
Emerging technologies have shown promise in supporting programs to restore soil health,
including remote sensing, mobile applications, and in-situ sensors.21 However, monitoring
systems have challenges to overcome, including energy efficiency constraints, cost, response
time, accuracy, and ease of use.22 Due to their heterogeneity, soils can be particularly hard to
meaningfully monitor without high spatial coverage, with soil microbial communities and soil
properties showing high spatial and temporal variability.20,23 Print-based fabrication of electronic
devices offers a potential solution to several of these limitations, as the low-cost of
manufacturing allows for large-scale deployment with high sensor counts, enabling high spatial
and temporal resolution for soil monitoring. Others have demonstrated the utility of a variety of
printed electronic sensors as applied in the continuous monitoring of soil physical and chemical
properties, including moisture,24–26 relative humidity,27 pH,28–30 nitrate,31–34 and chloride.35,36 We

have previously demonstrated printed electronic sensors which transduce microbial
decomposition activity into electrical resistance changes as soil microbes degrade a
poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate) (PHBV)/carbon composite conductor.3 In this approach, the
PHBV biopolymer (which is degraded in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions37), is blended
with carbon flake to form a printable ink. Using a stencil-printing process the ink is deposited
onto a surface and dried to create a resistor which is responsive to microbial activity. As the
resistor is decomposed through biotic activity in the soil, it swells more effectively, leading to an
increase in resistance over time with a gradient which dynamically corresponds to the level of
microbial activity. The resistance changes that are provided by the sensor are trivially simple to
measure using conventional low-cost electronics, thereby supporting high-density deployments
that provide time-series data whilst keeping instrumentation costs low.
In this report, the performance of and methods for use and analysis of these sensors is evaluated
in a first large-scale field deployment within a long-term grassland biodiversity restoration
experiment in northern England. This site includes experimental treatments of different
agricultural management practices, which have led to significant differences in soil properties
and plant productivity over the site. We compared signals from the sensors and related them to
standard measures of soil microbial biomass and function across 44 experimental plots over 50
days during the summer of 2023. Previous studies at this deployment site have demonstrated
significant shifts in microbial communities, including their biomass and activity in response to
management treatments.38 As such, this experiment provided an excellent basis for examining
the function of these novel sensors and the relationship between their response and traditional
laboratory soil measurements
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sensor Fabrication
The deployed sensors were prepared according to previous reports.3 a single loop microbe
responsive resistor (width 3 mm, length 75 mm) composed of a PHBV/carbon flake composite
was printed using a laser-cut tape stencil on to a glass substrate. A conductive epoxy (MG
Chemicals 8331D) was used to connect two leads at either side of the trace, followed by dipping
in a weatherizing adhesive (FlexSeal) to waterproof the connections. This left the conductive
polymer trace exposed (Figure 1b). Each sensor has a waterproof connector at the end of a signal
wire that is roughly 15 cm in length. Sensor readout was achieved using custom made data
loggers, where each logger supports up to six channels though which individual sensors can be
read. Loggers were produced using low-cost electronics, including an SD-card enabled
microcontroller (Arduino, Inc.), a lithium polymer battery, a watertight enclosure, and a timing
circuit which provided power to the microcontroller every 30 minutes.

Deployment Site and Approach
The study took place in Colt Park Meadows, located in the Ingleborough National Nature
Reserve (Latitude 54°12’N, Longitude 2°21’W, 350 m.a.s.l.) in the United Kingdom. The test
site is part of a long-term grassland biodiversity restoration experiment established in 1989 on
agriculturally improved, species-poor mesotrophic grasslands.39 It has provided a variety of
management-relevant experimental restoration treatments on a field scale. The soil is
characterized by moderate to high residual fertility in a shallow brown-earth profile. These
grasslands have been targeted by various environmental land management schemes aimed at
enhancing botanical diversity and soil health.40,41 The experiment includes four main treatments
with their respective controls, using a full factorial and split-plot design to provide 16 different
management treatment combinations. These treatments include periodic applications of inorganic
fertilizer (nitrogen:phosphorus:potassium = 20:10:10) at 25 kg nitrogen ha-1 y-1; starting in 1990.
Another involves the annual addition of farmyard manure at 12 t ha-1, beginning in 1998. Efforts
to enhance plant diversity began in 1990 with the addition of mixed seeds from 19 species.
Furthermore, the promotion of the nitrogen-fixing leguminous herb, Trifolium pratense (red
clover), began with seed additions in 2004, with a repeat in 2011. Each treatment combination is
replicated across three blocks, resulting in a total of 48 sampling plots (each 3 × 3 m). These
interventions have been shown to improve multiple soil health indicators, such as microbial
biomass, enzymatic activity, and soil carbon storage.38,42–45 As a result of these historical
treatments, the Colt Park site now comprises plots that differ in plant community composition
and soil microbiomes, creating a useful diverse test bed for evaluating sensor performance under
different microbial conditions.
Sensor deployment occurred between June 19th and August 7th, 2023, coinciding with the end of
a national drought in the UK. Sensors were installed within 44 plots, across the southern portions
of all three blocks. Sensors were installed near the center of each instrumented plot, with signal
lines running out to loggers (Figure 1). Within each plot, sensors were installed by cutting a slit
in the soil surface, excavating a small cubic hole at the top of the slit to house the wider epoxied
housing, and inserting the sensing surface containing the printed resistor taking care to minimize
disturbance. Soil was then loosely packed back into the excavated space and allowed to rebound,
closing the slit around the sensor.
In total 44 sensors were placed under the soil in the various experimental plots. The state of the
sensors was continuously monitored over the course of 50 days using custom waterproof data
loggers each capable of interrogating up to 6 individual sensors through wired connections, as
depicted in Figure 1.

the field. (b) Image of a single decomposition sensor.
Soil Sampling and Measurements
Within each plot, soil sampling methods were used to obtain laboratory measurements for a
variety of chemical and biological parameters near the mid-point of the deployment period, in
mid-July. The lab measurements included soil organic content (SOC), determined by an
elemental analyzer (Elementar Vario EL CN analyzer) as no detectable inorganic carbon was
found in the samples. Additionally, three extracellular enzyme activities were measured by
standard colorimetric analysis:46 glucosidase (GLC), glucosaminidase (NAG), and phosphatase
(PHO), which represent carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus decomposition or acquisition enzymes,
respectively. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was obtained using the fumigation-extraction
method.47
Sensor Data Analysis Methods
The soil decomposition sensors generally show a consistent increasing resistance over time in
response to microbial activity in the soil (Supplemental Figures S1, S2). At some point (typically
weeks after installation for this particular materials set and sensor design), the resistor material is
sufficiently damaged by microbial activity and the resistance rapidly increases indicating that the
device has reached the end of its useful lifetime. The data recorded, after an initial settling time
and prior to this failure point, defines a decomposition window in which useful data can be
extracted. In some cases, likely due to variability related to the fabrication process or issues
which occur during installation, a sensor will either be non-responsive or will fail very rapidly in
comparison to other devices. These devices are easily identified, and as such a first step in the
data analysis pipeline is to use a polynomial fitting algorithm to remove these anomalous signals.
In particular, devices with a low correlation coefficient (R2 < 0.5) from a second-order
polynomial regression were removed from the analysis, along with one additional sensor which
had a spuriously high initial resistance. This left 31 sensors for inclusion in the analysis. With the
remaining data set, three analysis approaches (Figure 2) were then evaluated: a single

decomposition window approach (Analysis 1), an approach that uses individual sensor fits with
two varying decomposition windows (Analysis 2), and a sensor signal changepoint analysis
(Analysis 3), to understand how these different analytical approaches impact correlation to other
field measurements.
Analysis 1 evaluated all sensor responses using a single decomposition window. To define a
decomposition window for analysis, all filtered sensor signals were averaged and changepoint
detection was used to define the point at which the average sensor signal changes significantly
(Supplemental Figure S3). For the sensor fleet as a whole, this defined the end of the
decomposition window and the beginning of the sensor failure phase. The signal following this
sensor failure time was removed from the dataset. Next, a second changepoint detection was
applied to the remaining data to define the beginning of the decomposition window following
sensor settling in the soil. A short buffer of three days was applied at the beginning and end of
the window in order to isolate the region in which sensor responses are well-defined
(Supplemental Figure S4). Each sensor’s slope within the decomposition window was taken
using a second-order linear regression, and we took the linear coefficient to be the slope. On a
per-sensor basis, sensor slopes were then compared to a range of measured attributes within the
plots.
Analysis 2 differs from Analysis 1 in two primary ways: first, we considered individual
decomposition windows on a per-sensor basis, varying the beginning and end of the period
included in the analysis by sensor signal. Second, visual examination of the sensor signals
suggested two distinct phases of decomposition, with the slope increasing more rapidly in a
phase prior to total sensor failure, so we aimed to investigate the relationship between the rate of
decomposition and the soil parameter measurements in two phases. In this analysis, changepoint
detection was applied to each individual sensor signal iteratively. First, a changepoint analysis,
assuming changes in mean and variance, was applied to each individual sensor signal to identify
the time of sensor failure. The time of failure is defined as the changepoint where the ratio of
variance before and after the changepoint reaches the maximum. A minimum decomposing time
of 10 days was used to avoid the identification of unrealistic early time of failure due to the
division of a moderate variance by a very small variance in the segment before the changepoint.
The signal beyond this point was removed from the analysis. A second changepoint detection,
assuming there is at most one change in the slope, was used to differentiate phase 1 and phase 2
of the remaining decomposition signal. Finally, a first-order linear regression model was applied
to each phase. The estimated slope parameters from the two phases were correlated to soil
parameter measurements respectively (Supplementary Figure S5).
The third analysis method focused on the number of significant changepoints observed in a given
sensor’s signal, rather than the rate of sensor decomposition. This analysis does not require the
definition of any specific decomposition window, looking instead at the total number of
changepoints detected in a particular sensor’s signal during deployment prior to sensor failure .

For this approach the failure time of each sensor signal is detected in the same way as described
for analysis 2. Whereas the previous two analyses considered a polynomial fit or regression
model for the remaining data, we instead continued with the changepoint approach and allowed
the number of changepoints to be estimated (Supplementary Figure S6). The changepoint model
includes both linear and quadratic terms to model more local features and is fit using the optimal
pruned exact linear time (PELT) changepoint search algorithm48 via the EnyCpt R package.49
The number of detected changes was then correlated to soil parameter measurements (Figure 2,
Analysis 3).

Figure 2. Illustration of the data extraction procedure for the three analysis approaches. For
analysis approach 1 slopes within the decomposition window are extracted and are correlated to
laboratory measurements. The second analysis broke each sensor signal into two sensor-specific
decomposition windows (d, e). On a per-sensor basis, correlations were then taken between the
measured parameter and slopes within each phase (f). The third approach used the number of
decomposition function changepoints as a proxy for microbial activity and stability, breaking
each sensor signal into sensible changepoints (g, h). On a per-sensor basis, the number of
changepoints was then correlated to each measured parameter (i).

The goal of this work was to determine whether the sensor signals mirrored more conventional
measurements from the plots. To this end, we carried out a series of regression analyses of sensor
signals against measured soil attributes and present these analyses and the associated R2 and p
values. It should be noted that based on the focus of the study, sufficient sensors were not
available in order to replicate a standard randomized design for evaluation of treatment
differences. All data analysis was carried out with R version 4.3.2. utilizing the changepoint
detection package,50.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Soil indicators
As expected, due to differing soil conditions originating from combinations of historical
management treatments, lab measurements of soil parameters show a wide range of values across
the experimental plots. These indicators are used in current soil health measurements,14,51–53 and
are commonly known as key factors controlling soil organic matter decomposition rates. SOC is
one of the most widely used soil health indicators,14 given its role in enhancing soil physical
stability, improving water retention, and carbon sequestration. The SOC content ranges from
6.65% to 10.58% across all plots, indicating generally high but variable substrate availability for
microbial decomposition. MBC represents a small yet active carbon pool in this study,
comprising approximately 2.1% of the total SOC on average, consistent with findings from other
studies.54 It has been suggested as dominant factor that controls the overall decomposition rate of
soil organic matter.55 Extracellular enzymes in the soil, mainly produced by microbes, are
directly involved in the breakdown of certain organic materials and nutrient cycling (e.g., carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus cycling), thereby directly affecting plant growth and soil fertility,56 and can
be used to indicate substrate-specific decomposition processes. The enzymes measured here also
exhibit high variability (Figure 3), highlighting their sensitivity to management differences.
Together, these indicators provide a comprehensive picture of soil health and the soil
decomposition process. Monitoring these parameters helps in understanding the impacts of
ecosystem management practices and environmental changes on soil health and guides
sustainable soil management strategies, and for the purposes of this study demonstrates that a
wide range of soil conditions are available at this test site.

Sensor Data Analysis
Analysis 1: Single Decomposition Window
The results of Analysis 1 indicate that the rate of resistance change recorded by the sensor is
correlated with conventional measures of microbial biomass and activity, with significant
variability due to the hardware constraints of the deployed sensors. A positive correlation was
observed with MBC (R2 = 0.53, p = 1.2´10-5) and a negative correlation with the ratio
GLC:NAG (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.014), which has been considered as an index for early chitin
decomposition processes.57 A significant but weaker correlation is also observed with SOC (R2 =
0.16, p = 0.035) (Figure 4).

Analysis 2.
Considering two sensor-specific decomposition windows determined by changepoint analysis,
Phase 1 and Phase 2 slopes positively correlated to MBC (R2 = 0.52, p = 0.003, and R2 = 0.56, p
= 0.001 respectively). Weaker, yet still-significant correlations were found with SOC (R2 = 0.37,
p = 0.043, and R2 = 0.44, p = 0.015 respectively). This suggests that there is utility to both
Analysis 1 and Analysis 2, with useful biological information extractable from the fleet as a
whole or from individual sensors, even at this early stage of sensor development.
Analysis 3
This approach found correlations between the number of significant changepoints in the time
series data and laboratory measurements within plots. Statistically significant correlations were
found with a number of measurements (SOC R2 = 0.53, p = 0.001; PHO R2 = 0.46, p = 0.006;
MBC R2 = 0.37, p = 0.033, GLC R2 = 0.36, p = 0.038). It is worth noting that in the sites with
higher numbers of detected change points, we see a high number of detectable events over a
relatively short deployment period, suggesting that useful information can be gleaned by
monitoring at this relatively high frequency. It is also interesting that the more static carbonrelated measurement, SOC, correlates more strongly with the sensor signal in this approach than
MBC does.
All of the data analysis approaches described here resulted in statistically significant correlations
with MBC and SOC indicating a robust correlation to these soil properties. All statistically
significant results (p < 0.05) are shown below (Table 1).

Potential Environmental Application
The sensor described here shows promise in enabling wide-scale, in-situ, time-series data
collection that relates to widely used soil biological properties related to soil health. Low-cost
printed microbial sensors could support efforts to track and verify the rehabilitation of degraded
land and contribute to food security-related environmental monitoring. We have shown here that
several statistical approaches suggest a robust relationship between the sensor signal and
microbial biomass carbon and soil organic carbon, important indicators of soil health.
Additionally, a binning and averaging approach resulted in a negative correlation between sensor
response and the GLC:NAG ratio. With improvements to the fabrication of these decomposition
sensors, large-scale deployments could help overcome current limitations in soil biological
health monitoring programs.
Prominently, all three analysis approaches found significant correlations between the sensor
signal and measured MBC and SOC values in instrumented plots. Prior studies have shown a
positive correlation between MBC and organic matter mineralization,58,59 and have, in fact,
posited it as a more useful indicator when compared with other forms of SOC, including
particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC).60 MBC is also
often used as a biological indicator of soil health, showing promise as an early indicator of
ecological change following land use change and changes in agricultural practices.61–64 A lowcost and easily distributable solution for continuous MBC-proxy tracking would offer a new
high-spatiotemporal resolution window into these dynamics.
A potential application for this sensing approach is to continuously monitor the soil
microbiome’s metabolism and activity immediately following environmental perturbations; this
could yield useful insights into the resilience of the microbial community in the face of shocks
including droughts or agricultural practices like pest fumigation. These sensors could determine
whether critical nutrient cycling capacity is impacted by such events and help to characterize the
resilience of the microbiome by monitoring changes in nutrient cycling responses over time.
A primary challenge in interpreting this sensor data and making the results useful is the
stochastic response of individual sensors, both initially on installation and as decomposition rates
increase and sensors begin to fail. Upon insertion, the resistor can be damaged, rendering the
sensor useless; even with great care taken during installation, one sensor’s initial resistance in
this study indicated that physical damage had immediately occurred. Furthermore, if sensor
failure is rapid the useful life of the sensor can be meaningfully reduced. It is worth noting that
time to failure was not found to have a statistically significant correlation to measured soil
parameters. The rate of decomposition in analytically useful windows, on the other hand, does.
To address these issues ongoing experiments are examining approaches to control the
degradation process through material and hardware modifications, in order to improve reliability
of and reduce sensor-to-sensor variability.

A promising aspect of this research is the apparent specificity of this particular printed composite
conductor with regard to soil processes. Correlations with some traditional measures were strong,
where other parameters of interest correlated weakly or not at all with the sensor signal. In
particular, the more static measurement, SOC, correlated less significantly than MBC, which is a
more dynamic measurement. Furthermore, several approaches found varying correlations with
different sets of laboratory measurements. Significant opportunities might lie in the exploration
of other conductor formulations, applied to a similar deployment platform, but targeting other
decomposition pathways by selecting alternate binders. Another valuable aspect of the sensor
response is that the signal should be related only to living microbes, avoiding issues associated
with relic DNA, further enhancing the sensor’s specificity.
CONCLUSION
This report describes the first field deployment of a novel soil sensor designed to determine
microbial decomposition activity through a unique transduction mechanism based on a soil
degradable resistor. These low-cost sensors, manufactured from readily available materials using
printing approaches, and addressable by simple electronics could enable spatially dense, timeseries data collection of parameters related to soil health. This study provides an initial step
towards providing useful environmental data collection from this sensing approach by deploying
44 sensors over 50 days at an experimental field site with widely varying soil microbial
properties. Three approaches for extracting data from the sensor signal were evaluated, with the
principal finding being that all analyses demonstrated a robust correlation to microbial biomass
carbon, and soil organic carbon. The results described here suggest powerful potential
applications for these in-situ transient decomposition sensors to help characterize soil health
trajectories at high resolution, aligning with the need for larger spatial and temporal scales of soil
microbiome monitoring.
