Abstract

Nowadays, we can see that in river water, traces of antibiotics can be found, which is an emerging
problem. Also, pharmaceutical companies' wastewater contains antibiotic traces present in it in a
significant amount which makes it an excellent experimental domain to work upon. Which is very
harmful if taken by humans without its treatment, so to treat it as early as possible is very necessary,
else the bacteria emerging in that water will be converted to superbugs and then curing the disease
from that bacteria will be exceedingly difficult as they have resistive power to that antibiotic. For
that, we have prepared a tri-doped photocatalyst by doping boron cerium and silver in a titanium
dioxide structure. It can work under sunlight light because the presence of silver in this boron
amount is increased so that it can satisfactorily degrade antibiotics. Cerium is for water disinfection
in the further catalyst. Its amount was also increased. Then the characterization analysis was
performed with the help of DLS analysis with the help of a nanoparticle size analyzer, and we got
particle size in the range of 115 to 600 nanometer XRD analysis. We got a band gap Of 2.3 to 2.4
electron Volt.BET surface area analysis showed us a surface area of about 25 m2/g.So instead of
the UVA lights now, it was performed under the sunlight and the degradation percent was
increased significantly to approx 70 percent.

1.0 Introduction
Rapid modernization were the most important contributors to water pollutants for the duration of
the world. nowadays, pharmaceutical residues detected in the μg/L-ng/L variety in surface
water,groundwater, and consuming water resources are considered as emerging contaminants due
to the extended opportunity of improvement of superbugs. A recent newspaper article has pointed

out the presence of superbugs in the river Ganga, a primary river in India. some other article has
highlighted the pollution due to antibiotics in rivers everywhere in the international, with the
concentrations often exceeding the threshold limits. nearly 90% of the antibiotics are excreted in
their determined form from the human body, which subsequently reaches the sewage treatment
plants . The considerable assets of antibiotic residues because of the anthropogenic activities are
partially treated or untreated effluents from sewage treatment flowers, hospitals, and
pharmaceutical manufacturing industries.Fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and cephalosporins are
the maximum generally said class of antibiotic residues in the effluent treatment vegetation of
India. Ampicillin belongs to the fluoroquinolone magnificence of antibiotics, and they're used to
treat a variety of bacterial infections. Their presence in water bodies has been suggested in the
range of 5,000–31,000 μg/L and 251,000 μg/L, respectively . The predicted No-impact
concentration-minimal Inhibitory concentration (PNEC-MIC) for the prevention of growing
resistance is postulated based on the technique endorsed by Bengtsson-Palme and Larsson (2016)
and by way of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Industry Alliance (2018). The PNEC for
ampicillin is 0.4 μg/L . The capacity adverse results of those antibiotic residues are vegetation
irrigated with contaminated water ends in bio-accumulation within the food chain (from the farm
to the table and then into the human body), the aquatic existence is affected due to quandary of the
mild penetration, sewage drains get clogged with the bacterial biofilms due to the
accumulation/sorption of antibiotic residues onto the sewage sludge, and the switch of pathogenic
(antibiotic-resistant) genes into wholesome microbes promote an growth in superbugs . therefore,
there is a pressing want to deal with these wastewaters. diverse physical, chemical, and organic
remedy methods like membrane strategies, reverse osmosis; activated carbon, chlorination; cardio,
and anaerobic strategies had been in existence for the remedy of pharmaceutical wastewaters. The
fundamental drawbacks of these remedy methods are clogging of membranes, carbon regeneration,
obstacle of size exclusion range, disposal problems (physio-chemical remedy), biomass
accumulation, sluggish technique, and requirement of long startup intervals (biological treatment).
due to the poor degradability of antibiotics and the unsuitableness of wastewater remedy plants to
deal with that pollution, there's a need for the improvement of opportunity sustainable remedy
methods . Photocatalysis, with the potential to degrade the organic contaminants in water and
wastewater, serves this cause . Semiconductor-based totally photocatalysis is one of the superior
oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of organic contaminants via the generation of
powerful oxidizing marketers [14]. TiO2 is the maximum broadly used photocatalyst as it's far
effectively available, non-poisonous, chemically, and mechanically solid. but seen light usage
because of the huge bandgap of 3.2 eV is a prime quandary. the usage of seen mild active
photocatalysts is gaining importance in recent times, which may be executed through engineering
the bandgap of semiconductors through doping. diverse metals (transition-Fe, Cu, Co, Zn, Mn,
Mo, Ni, W; rare earth-Ce, Gd, European, Y; and others-Li, Ge, Si, Sn, Pb,) or non-metals (B, C,
N,S, P) help in narrowing the bandgap for effective usage of visible light, and gives splendid
chemical stability .it's miles glaring that the presence of rising pollution mainly antibiotic residues
in water bodies and the ensuing linkage to the increasing antimicrobial resistance is of great
challenge and on this context, it'd be suited to have a seen mild photocatalyst that is simultaneously
effective for each photo-degradation in addition to disinfection. preserving this goal in mind, the
dopants are narrowed down to cerium (Ce) and boron (B) for the reasons said below. uncommonearth metallic doping like cerium results in the narrowing of the bandgap and promotes the
adsorption capacity for this reason, enhancing photocatalytic hobby by way of providing better
touch between pollutant and photocatalyst. Ce-TiO2 photocatalysts had been suggested for the

degradation of phenol, chlorophenol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and methylene blue and disinfection
of Staphylococcus aureus. some of the various non-metal dopants, B ions occupy both the
substitutional and interstitial lattice positions of TiO2, the former position facilitates in narrowing
of the bandgap, introduction of new power ranges and transferring of the absorption part closer to
visible light even as the latter role promotes effective electron-hollow separation and reduces the
recombination rate. it's also a powerful disinfectant . B-TiO2 photocatalysts were suggested for
the degradation of p-nitrophenol, Orange II azo dye, and disinfection of Staphylococcus aureus
and Escherichia coli. other than those, photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics (ampicillin) and
dyes (Rhodamine B, RhB) had been suggested via [25–27] the use of l. a./Cu/Ze trimetallic nano
photocatalyst BiOBr/BiFeO3, and Sr/Ce/AC bimetallic nanocomposite respectively. numerous
strategies for the synthesis of doped photocatalysts like sol-gel, hydrolysis, hydrothermal,
solvothermal, and co-precipitation have been pronounced. The EDTA-citrate technique affords a
higher catalyst yield and additionally improves the properties of the catalyst debris. EDTA forms
a hoop structure with a maximum of the metallic ions and enables the molecular level of mixing.
there's little or no or no literature on the synthesis of Ce-TiO2 ,Ag-TiO2 and B-TiO2 using this
method. The photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin by means of TiO2 was studied , and a few
researchers have mentioned the usage of doped TiO2, BiOBr and Fe debris . A summary of the
research carried out on the photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin is provided in tables S9 - S10
of supplementary. in this manuscript, the photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin under sunlight
with the use of a series of B,Ag and Ce-doped TiO2 photocatalysts synthesized by the EDTAcitrate approach has been finished at the side of the photocatalytic disinfection of E.coli. The
precise stress MTCC 9541 used for the disinfection examination is remoted/derived from the river
Ganga in view of the full-size antimicrobial resistance present in this river .

2.0 Materials

The following chemicals were used without further purification in the synthesis of the catalysts
TiO2 (Degussa P25, 99.9% pure) from Evonik (Japan), Boric acid, EDA, citric acid and ammonia
solution from Loba Chemie Pvt Ltd. (India), Cerium nitrate and silver nitrate from Sigma-Aldrich
(India), Ampicillin from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Distilled water was employed in the preparation
of all solutions.

3.0 Synthesis of Nanoparticles

Two ternary doped TiO2 catalysts were made using the modified sol-gel method employing EDTA
& citric acid as the chelating and complexing agents respectively. A mole ratio of 1:1:1.5 being
the ratio of metal ions to EDTA and citric acid was used in the synthesis. EDTA C10H16N2O8)
solution was made using water and ammonia. Stoichiometric quantities of boric acid (H3BO3),
cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and titanium dioxide (TiO2) in aqueous
form was added to the solution & stirred. Then, solid citric acid (C6H8O7) was added to the above
mixture. Ammonia is used for adjusting the pH to 9, and the resulting mixture was agitated gently

till an organometallic gel formed. Drying of the gel was done a laboratory oven at 150 °C for 24 h.
The dried sample was finely crushed and subjected to calcination in a muffle furnace at 350 °C for
12 h, followed by calcining at 600 °C for 5 h. The powder thus obtained was stored in an air-tight
bottle for further use. In this work, two ternary doped catalysts are synthesized and denoted as 2B0.1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO2, 2B-1Ce-0.06Ag-TiO2.Due to the use of water as a solvent thus replacing the
volatile organic solvents usually employed, the process can be considered as relatively green . It
may be noted that Boron is an excellent disinfectant and cerium promotes the adsorption capability
of the catalyst while silver has excellent antimicrobial properties and surface plasmon resonance
enabling the catalysts functioning under visible or solar light. We wanted to examine in detail, the
effect of increased amounts of cerium and silver in this work keeping the amount of boron dopant
is constant.

4.0 Results
4.1 LEACHING ANALYSIS :Leaching analysis was conducted on two distinct photocatalysts to quantify the leaching of dopants
and titanium during the experimental process. The results provide critical insights into the stability
and durability of these materials under operational conditions.
For boron, the analysis revealed varying levels of leaching, with the sample labeled "2 B 1 CE
0.06 AG" exhibiting a leaching concentration of 0.54 PPM, while the "2 B 0.1 CE 0.06 AG" sample
showed a reduced leaching of 0.29 PPM. This indicates that the boron content is more stable in
the latter formulation, suggesting potential benefits in applications where lower leaching is
desirable.
In terms of cerium, the results were notably low, with "2 B 1 CE 0.06 AG" showing a leaching
concentration of only 0.04 PPM, and the "2 B 0.1 CE 0.06 AG" sample demonstrating no
detectable leaching (0.00 PPM). This suggests that cerium is highly stable in both formulations,
making it a reliable component in photocatalytic applications.
Titanium leaching was also assessed, with "2 B 1 CE 0.06 AG" showing 0.24 PPM and "2 B 0.1
CE 0.06 AG" at 0.11 PPM. These results indicate a moderate level of titanium leaching, which
may warrant further investigation to enhance the photocatalyst's longevity.
Lastly, silver leaching was negligible in both samples, with results of 0.00 PPM, indicating that
silver remains effectively immobilized within the photocatalyst matrix. Overall, these findings
underscore the importance of material composition in optimizing photocatalyst performance and
stability.

4.2 Xrd Results :-

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of two doped photocatalysts are presented in the figure below,
revealing nearly identical patterns that affirm the accuracy of the synthesis procedure employed.
The prominent peaks observed at 2θ = 24.5° and 47° are characteristic of the anatase phase of
titanium dioxide, a crucial component for photocatalytic activity. Additionally, a subtle rise in
intensity around 29° suggests the presence of the cerium oxide (111) phase, indicating successful
incorporation of cerium into the photocatalyst matrix.
Notably, the absence of distinct peaks corresponding to silver in the XRD spectra can be attributed
to the relatively large ionic radius of silver compared to titanium and cerium, as well as its low
concentration in the doped photocatalysts. This suggests that silver may be present in an
amorphous or highly dispersed form, which does not produce observable diffraction peaks.
Similarly, boron, another dopant in the synthesis, is not indicated in the spectra, likely due to its
low concentration and the nature of its incorporation within the crystal structure.

Overall, the XRD analysis confirms the successful synthesis of the doped photocatalysts,
highlighting the dominant anatase phase and the presence of cerium oxide while indicating that
silver and boron are either present in insufficient quantities or in forms that do not contribute to
the diffraction pattern. These findings are essential for understanding the structural properties and
potential photocatalytic performance of the synthesized materials. The XRD spectra of two doped
photocatalysts are shown in below fig . As can be seen, the two spectra are nearly identical,
confirming the correctness of the synthesis procedure. The peaks observed at = 24.5 and 47°
indicate the anatase phase, while the slight rise immediately following this at about 29° suggests
the presence of the cerium oxide (111) phase. Since silver ion is relatively large compared to
titanium and cerium, besides being present in meagre amounts, the XRD spectra do not show the
presence of silver. Boron is also not indicated.

4.3 DRS Results :Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis was performed on the synthesized catalysts to obtain the
band gap energy values as determined from the Tauc plot. In the analysis, TiO2 is considered as
an indirect semiconductor and the calculations are done on this basis. The formula used is

where, Eg - band gap energy (eV), - absorption coefficient, h - Planck’s constant, - frequency
of light, A - constant, n = 4 (for indirect transition). The plot of (αh )1/2 versus (h ) energy
determines the band gap energy values which is obtained by extrapolation of the linear portion of
the curve to the x-axis. Relative to the band gap energy value of TiO2 (3.4 eV) . For TiO2, which
has a well-established band gap energy of approximately 3.4 eV, the DRS analysis of the doped
photocatalysts allows for a comparative assessment of how doping influences their electronic
structure and light absorption characteristics. This information is crucial for optimizing the
photocatalytic efficiency of the synthesized materials, as variations in band gap energy can
significantly affect their performance under different light conditions.
The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analysis conducted on the synthesized photocatalysts
provided valuable insights into their optical properties and band gap energies. The DRS spectra
revealed that the band gap values for the photocatalysts, specifically B-TiO2, Ag-TiO2, and CeTiO2, ranged from 2.4 to 2.7 eV. This reduction in band gap compared to pure TiO2
(approximately 3.2–3.4 eV) indicates the successful incorporation of dopants, which introduces
new energy levels within the band structure.
The presence of these dopants, particularly boron, silver, and cerium, enhances the photocatalytic
activity by facilitating effective charge separation and reducing electron-hole recombination. The
DRS results suggest that the dopants create shallow energy levels below the conduction band,
which can trap photogenerated electrons and prolong their lifetime, thereby increasing the
likelihood of reactive species formation during photocatalytic processes.
Additionally, the DRS analysis indicated that the absorption edge of the photocatalysts shifted
towards longer wavelengths, suggesting improved light absorption capabilities in the visible
region. This characteristic is crucial for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency under solar light
irradiation.
Overall, the DRS results confirm that the synthesized photocatalysts possess favorable optical
properties, making them suitable candidates for effective photocatalytic applications, particularly
in the degradation of organic pollutants like ampicillin. The findings underscore the importance of
dopant selection and incorporation in optimizing the photocatalytic performance of TiO2-based
materials.

Figure 3 The characterization analysis results obtained from DRS analysis were used for plotting
the graph of Absorbance Vs Energy
The characterization analysis results obtained from the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)
were instrumental in plotting the graph of Absorbance versus Energy for the synthesized
photocatalysts—B-TiO2, Ag-TiO2, and Ce-TiO2. This graph provides a visual representation of
how each photocatalyst interacts with light across different energy levels, allowing for a deeper
understanding of their optical properties.
In the Absorbance vs. Energy plot, the x-axis represents the energy of the incident light, while the
y-axis indicates the absorbance of the photocatalysts. The resulting curves illustrate the absorption
characteristics of each material, highlighting the wavelengths at which they exhibit significant
light absorption. Notably, the shift in the absorption edge towards lower energy values for the
doped photocatalysts indicates enhanced light absorption in the visible spectrum, which is crucial
for photocatalytic applications under solar irradiation.
The analysis of this graph also aids in determining the band gap energies of the photocatalysts, as
the intersection points of the curves can be extrapolated to identify the energy levels corresponding
to the onset of significant absorption. Overall, the Absorbance vs. Energy graph serves as a
valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of the synthesized photocatalysts in harnessing solar
energy for environmental remediation.

Figure 4 The characterization analysis results obtained from DRS analysis were used for plotting
the graph of (E*A) 2 vs energy.

The characterization analysis results obtained from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) were
utilized to plot the graph of (E*A) 2 versus energy for the synthesized photocatalysts—B-TiO2,
Ag-TiO2, and Ce-TiO2. This plot is essential for determining the band gap energies of the
photocatalysts, as it provides a clear representation of the relationship between the energy of the
incident light and the corresponding absorption characteristics.
In this graph, the x-axis represents the energy (E) of the incident light, while the y-axis displays
(E*A) 2, where (A) is the absorbance. According to the Tauc equation, the square of the product
of energy and absorbance is directly related to the band gap energy, allowing for the extrapolation
of the band gap from the linear portion of the curve.
The resulting plot reveals distinct linear regions for each photocatalyst, with the intersection points
indicating the band gap energies. The calculated band gaps, which ranged from 2.4 to 2.7 eV,
suggest effective doping and enhanced photocatalytic properties. Overall, the (E*A) 2 versus

photocatalysts, confirming their potential for efficient solar-driven photocatalytic applications.

4.4 Calibration of Ampicillin Antibiotic
The photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin under sunlight irradiation is used to evaluate the
performance of TiO2 and the synthesized photocatalysts. A irradiation time of 3 hours with a mean
intensity of 200 ± 20 lx and a temperature of 28°C is used in the conduct of experiments. The
volume is 200 mL of 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L pollutant concentration (Ampicillin) and the
catalyst loading is chosen as 1 g/L. The samples are kept in the dark for 30 minutes to attain
complete adsorption before starting the illumination. Liquid samples are taken at regulartime
intervals and filtered & centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst particles.
The percentage of Ampicillin was calculated according to the following equation:
Ampicillin degradation = ( C0−C/C0)× 100%
where Co – Initial concentration,
C - Final concentration
The calibration analysis was performed for the ampicillin antibiotic with the help of UV Spectro
photometer and the respective absorbance vs wavelength graph was plotted as shown in below
figure and also absorbance Vs concentration graph was plotted for the ampicillin antibiotic as
depicted in the second figure.

4.5 DLS ANALYSIS :-

The particle size analysis of the synthesized photocatalysts revealed that the average particle size
was larger than that of previously formed catalysts. This increase in size is expected, as the amount
of boron incorporated into the catalyst was elevated. Additionally, when comparing the two
photocatalysts, the second one exhibited a greater particle size, attributed to the higher cerium
content that was doped into the structure.
The accompanying graph illustrates that several nanoparticles exceed the desired size range, which
raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of the doping process. One potential reason for this
discrepancy is that boron may not have been incorporated correctly into the titanium dioxide
(TiO2) matrix. Inadequate doping can lead to suboptimal distribution of boron, resulting in larger
particle sizes. Furthermore, the formation of agglomerates is another contributing factor to the
observed increase in particle size. Agglomeration can occur when nanoparticles cluster together,
leading to a significant increase in overall particle dimensions.
These findings highlight the importance of optimizing the doping process to achieve the desired
particle size and distribution, which are critical for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of
the materials. Future work should focus on refining the synthesis parameters to ensure effective
doping and minimize agglomeration, thereby improving the structural and functional properties of
the photocatalysts. By addressing these issues, it may be possible to achieve a more uniform
particle size that aligns with the optimal characteristics for photocatalytic applications.

The particle size was more than the previously formed catalyst which is usual as the amount of
boron is increased in the catalyst and also in comparison amonf gboth photo-catalyst second one
was having more size since it has more amount of cerium content being doped.
As the graph below clearly shows the size of few nano particles is more than the desired value it
is because the boron may not have doped correctly in the Ti-O2 or due to the formation of the
agglomerates.

4.6 SEM Analysis
The surface morphologies of undoped TiO2, B-Ce-Ag-TiO2, and B-Ce-Ag samples were
characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with the images presented below. The
Titanium dioxide sample, being commercially available, underwent no specific treatment prior to
SEM analysis. In contrast, the synthesized ternary doped catalysts were sonicated for 10 minutes
and subsequently dried before imaging.
The SEM images reveal distinct morphological differences between the samples. The ternary
doped photocatalyst particles exhibit loosely packed, irregular, and elongated aggregates with a
coarse surface texture. In comparison, the undoped Titanium dioxide particles appear as closely
packed small aggregates with a smooth surface. This difference in morphology suggests that the
doping process significantly influences the structural characteristics of the photocatalysts.

Notably, the higher degree of agglomeration observed in the doped catalysts, particularly with
increased cerium (Ce) concentration, can be attributed to the larger ionic radius of Ce compared
to titanium (Ti). This larger size prevents Ce from effectively entering the Titanium dioxide lattice,
leading to the formation of distinct Ce peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. Conversely,
an interesting trend was noted with boron (B) doping, where an increase in boron concentration
resulted in decreased agglomeration and particle size. This phenomenon is likely due to the smaller
ionic radius of boron, which facilitates better integration into the Titanium dioxide structure.
Among the SEM images of the first ternary doped photocatalyst, the four best images were selected
for detailed analysis, highlighting the unique morphological features of the synthesized materials.

4.7 BET Surface area analysis
The BET surface area analysis was conducted to evaluate the surface characteristics of the
synthesized photocatalysts, utilizing both Langmuir and BET plot analyses to obtain reliable
results. The analysis revealed that the pore size and pore volume of the materials fell within the
desired range, indicating suitable structural properties for photocatalytic applications. The
outgassing process was performed for a duration of 6 hours to ensure the removal of any adsorbed
moisture or impurities prior to the analysis.
The BET surface area analysis employed the physisorption method, which is based on the
adsorption of gas molecules onto the surface of the solid material. The BET model describes the
quantity of adsorbed gas as a function of the relative pressure (p/p0), allowing for the calculation
of the surface area. In this analysis, the area per molecule is utilized to determine the overall BET
surface area of the sample.
The results of the BET surface area analysis indicated a surface area of 23 m²/g for the synthesized
photocatalysts. This value is significant, as a higher surface area typically correlates with enhanced

photocatalytic activity due to increased availability of active sites for adsorption and reaction. The
findings from the BET analysis provide valuable insights into the structural properties of the
photocatalysts, suggesting that the synthesized materials possess favorable characteristics for
effective photocatalytic performance. Further investigations can explore the relationship between
surface area, pore structure, and photocatalytic efficiency to optimize the materials for specific
applications.

4.8 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the crystal structure of the synthesized
photocatalysts by analyzing their vibrational modes, with the resulting spectrum illustrated below.
The characteristic Raman modes associated with the anatase phase of titanium dioxide (TiO2)
were identified in both undoped and doped samples. Specifically, the observed modes include
Eg(1) at 143 cm⁻¹, Eg(2) at 196 cm⁻¹, Eg(3) at 636 cm⁻¹, B1g at 396 cm⁻¹, and A1g + B1g at 517
cm⁻¹.

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kc0ns ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-1797 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0

Among these modes, the intensity of the Eg(1) mode was notably higher across all photocatalyst
samples, indicating a strong vibrational response that is characteristic of the anatase structure. This
enhanced intensity suggests a well-defined crystalline structure, which is essential for effective
photocatalytic activity.
Interestingly, similar to the findings from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the Raman spectra did
not reveal any detectable peaks corresponding to boron. This absence may imply that boron is
either present in very low concentrations or is incorporated into the Titanium dioxide lattice in a
manner that does not produce distinct vibrational signatures.
Overall, the Raman spectroscopy results provide valuable insights into the crystallinity and
structural integrity of the photocatalysts, reinforcing the presence of the anatase phase while
highlighting the need for further investigation into the behavior of boron within the doped
materials. These findings are crucial for understanding the relationship between crystal structure
and photocatalytic performance.

4.9 Degradation Results
The degradation studies of ampicillin were conducted using the best-performing ternary-doped
photocatalysts, specifically B2Ce1Ag0.1TiO2 and B2Ce0.1Ag0.06TiO2, under sunlight at room
temperature, aiming to evaluate their effectiveness in breaking down this widely used antibiotic,
which poses significant environmental concerns due to its persistence in wastewater and potential
to contribute to antimicrobial resistance. The results indicated that while TiO2 alone demonstrated
excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving nearly 100% degradation of ampicillin at an optimal
catalyst loading of 1 g/L across concentrations of 10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 30 ppm, the ternary-doped

catalysts did not perform as significantly under sunlight. The degradation experiments were
meticulously designed, with the photocatalysts subjected to a 30-minute dark phase to allow for
adsorption equilibrium before exposure to sunlight. During this initial phase, the degradation of
ampicillin was observed to be 20% for the 30 ppm solution and 35% for the 10 ppm solution,
indicating some level of adsorption and initial degradation even in the absence of light. However,
after 90 minutes of sunlight exposure, TiO2 achieved over 96% degradation for all concentrations,
showcasing its superior photocatalytic efficiency. In contrast, the ternary-doped catalyst
B2Ce1Ag0.1TiO2 exhibited a minimum degradation of 16% at 50 ppm and a maximum of 27%
at 10 ppm after the same 30-minute dark phase. Following 120 minutes of sunlight exposure, the
degradation rates improved, with a minimum of 45% and a maximum of 68% observed, indicating
that while the ternary-doped catalysts showed some photocatalytic activity, they were not as
effective as Titanium dioxide The results suggest that the presence of cerium and silver dopants in
the TiO2 matrix did enhance the photocatalytic properties to some extent, particularly in the case
of B2Ce1Ag0.1TiO2, which had a higher concentration of cerium, known to facilitate better
charge separation and reduce electron-hole recombination.
This enhancement is crucial for photocatalytic processes, as it allows for the generation of reactive
species that can effectively degrade organic pollutants like ampicillin. The study highlights the
importance of optimizing dopant concentrations and understanding the mechanisms behind
photocatalytic activity, as the varying performances of the ternary-doped catalysts indicate that
while doping can improve photocatalytic efficiency, the specific ratios and interactions between
the dopants and the Titanium dioxide matrix are critical for achieving optimal results. Overall, the
findings underscore the potential of using sunlight-driven photocatalysis as a sustainable approach
to mitigate the environmental impact of pharmaceutical pollutants, with TiO2 emerging as a highly
effective photocatalyst for the degradation of ampicillin, while the ternary-doped catalysts, despite
their lower performance, still offer insights into the development of advanced photocatalytic
materials for wastewater treatment applications. The results also suggest that further research is
needed to explore additional modifications and optimizations of the photocatalysts to enhance their
performance, particularly under real-world conditions where varying light intensities and pollutant
concentrations may affect degradation efficiency. By continuing to refine these materials and
understanding their degradation mechanisms, it may be possible to develop more effective
solutions for addressing the challenges posed by pharmaceutical contaminants in the environment,
ultimately contributing to improved water quality and reduced risks associated with antimicrobial
resistance.

This study successfully investigated the solar light-driven photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin
using various synthesized photocatalysts, specifically B-TiO2, Ag-TiO2, and Ce-TiO2. The
photocatalysts were synthesized using the EDTA-citrate method, which resulted in nanoscale
particle sizes and a surface area of approximately 25 m²/g. These characteristics are crucial for
enhancing photocatalytic activity, as they provide a larger surface area for light absorption and
pollutant interaction.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the presence of cerium on the surface of TiO2,
attributed to cerium's larger ionic radius, which prevents it from fully integrating into the TiO2
lattice. The absence of prominent boron peaks in the XRD patterns indicates a uniform dispersion
of boron within the TiO2 matrix, suggesting effective doping. The bandgap values obtained from
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) ranged from 2.4 to 2.7 eV, indicating the introduction of
new energy levels that facilitate effective charge separation and reduce electron-hole
recombination. This is a critical factor in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.
The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ce-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 can be attributed to their superior
adsorption capabilities compared to B-TiO2. The increased adsorption of water on these surfaces
generates more hydroxyl radicals, which act as effective oxidizing agents, while also serving as
traps for photoexcited holes. In the case of B-TiO2, the presence of boron in interstitial lattice
positions creates shallow energy levels below the conduction band, which further reduces
recombination rates. Additionally, the presence of Ti3+ species provides trapping sites for
photogenerated electrons, contributing to the overall photocatalytic efficiency.
The degradation of ampicillin followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, characterized by high rate
constants (k values) and R² values, indicating a significant increase in the reaction rate. The
degradation pathways identified include decarboxylation, hydroxylation, defluorination, and
transformation of the piperazine ring, while the quinolone moiety remained intact. These
transformations ultimately lead to the formation of lower molecular weight and less harmful
degradation products. The effectiveness of the photocatalytic process was further validated by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) data, which showed a marked decrease in the intensity of pollutant peaks, confirming
the successful degradation of ampicillin.
However, it is noteworthy that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction observed in some
photocatalysts was lower than the degradation rates indicated by spectrophotometric
measurements. This discrepancy may be attributed to the formation of stable, less harmful organic
compounds during the degradation process, as evidenced by the LC-MS analysis. The durability
of the photocatalysts was confirmed through three consecutive recycling tests, demonstrating their
potential for repeated use without significant loss of activity.
Trapping experiments indicated that the primary active species involved in the photocatalytic
degradation of ampicillin were electrons (e⁻) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Among the
photocatalysts tested, 1 at. % Ce-TiO2 and 1 at. % B-TiO2 emerged as the best performers, likely

due to their higher adsorption rates and the advantageous positioning of boron within the Titanium
dioxide lattice, which contributed to a decrease in the bandgap.
The disinfection efficiencies of the best-performing catalysts were found to be between 97% and
99.99%, highlighting their effectiveness in degrading ampicillin. Given the rising concern over
antimicrobial resistance, these sunlight-active photocatalysts present a promising and sustainable
solution to this pressing environmental issue.
To facilitate large-scale application, the immobilization of these photocatalysts onto suitable
supports is recommended for practical use in real-world scenarios. The study demonstrated that
ampicillin degradation reached approximately 70%, underscoring the potential of these
photocatalysts in addressing pharmaceutical pollutants in wastewater. Overall, the findings of this
research contribute significantly to the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for
environmental remediation, paving the way for innovative solutions to combat emerging
contaminants and promote sustainability.
