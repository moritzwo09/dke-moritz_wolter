Abstract
Widespread, persistent, and toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a major threat
to both water systems and human health. Current PFAS detection methods are relatively expensive,
slow, and complex. To combat PFAS contamination and meet increasingly stringent regulations of
PFAS in drinking water, the development of highly sensitive and selective PFAS sensing
techniques is urgently needed. Herein, we present an ultrasensitive sensing platform for
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) detection in tap water with a reporting limit (~250 ppq)
lower than the maximum contaminant level (4 ppt) set by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, using remote gate field-effect transistor (RGFET) sensors featuring β-cyclodextrin (βCD)-modified reduced graphene oxide as the sensing membrane. The sensor exhibits excellent
selectivity against common inorganic ions (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, HPO42-, SO42- ) and select
organic pollutants (e.g., trichloroacetic acid) in tap water. Importantly, the reversible and rapid
response (< 2 min) indicates the potential of RGFET for continuous inline monitoring of PFAS.
Quartz crystal microbalance results emphasize the important roles of both analyte adsorption and
charge properties of analytes and buffers in generating sensing signals. The binding nature between
β-CD probe and PFOS or interferent molecules, as well as the spatially resolved selectivity
revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, suggest rational probe engineering strategies for
future selective capture probe design.

They

have

been

frequently used in industrial manufacturing and are present in various consumer products, owing
to their unique properties including high resistance to heat and chemicals, surfactant nature,
hydrophobicity, and lipophobicity1-3. Throughout the lifecycle of PFAS-containing products, PFAS
molecules are released into the environment, transported within and across various media, and
eventually enter human bodies3, 4. Because of the exceptionally strong carbon-fluorine bond (CF), PFAS resist degradation under natural or biological conditions, and therefore tend to
accumulate in the environment and inside human bodies5, 6. Extensive epidemiological studies
have revealed the correlation between PFAS exposure and many adverse health effects such as
compromised immune system, thyroid disease, liver damage, reproductive and developmental
defects, and even cancers6, 7.
Drinking water is a common and important pathway through which people can directly be
exposed to and ingest PFAS. Multiple PFAS species have been detected in drinking water/tap water
at concentrations ranging from a few ppt (ng/L) to hundreds of ppt all over the world8, 9. Several
regulatory agencies have set guidelines and standards for certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water
in response to ongoing PFAS exposure8. On April 10, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) announced the final National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for six PFAS
and established their maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in drinking water, with an MCL of 4
ppt for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), two
predominant legacy PFAS molecules (https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substancespfas). The ongoing water crisis caused by PFAS pollution, and the increasingly stringent
regulations emphasize the urgent need for effective monitoring of PFAS concentrations in water.

PFAS detection in tap water is challenging due to the complexity of water matrices and the
relatively low concentrations of PFAS compared with co-existing ions and organic water
constituents. High sensitivity and selectivity for sensors are the key requirements to achieve
effective PFAS detection10, 11. Currently, the standard detection method based on solid-phase
extraction (SPE)-enabled liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) defined
by USEPA (EPA Methods 533 and 537.1)12, 13 can meet both requirements. However, this technique
requires expensive and sophisticated instruments, well-trained personnel, and tedious procedures,
which limits its prevalence in both PFAS research and real-world applications. Developing
accessible and rapid PFAS sensors with satisfactory performance has become a major goal14. To
date, most PFAS sensors presented in publications are either based on fluorescent or
electrochemical sensing mechanisms10. Fluorescent sensors15-17 with simple systems and large
design space can render certain selectivity by designing selective probes, but their detection limit
(~ppb) is typically insufficient for PFAS monitoring at environmentally relevant concentrations
(~ppt). By contrast, electrochemical sensors18-20 can measure PFAS concentrations down to subppb levels; however, the PFAS sensing selectivity as a major challenge has seldom been
demonstrated or achieved10, 21. Moreover, few of these explored sensors have shown the potential
for real-time continuous sensing. Field-effect transistor (FET) sensors belonging to the electronic
sensor family22, another important category of water sensors, have been extensively studied in the
detection of diverse water pollutants, including heavy metal ions23, 24, nutrients25, 26, and bacteria27,
28

. The high sensitivity and readily tunable selectivity together with other advantages like fast

response and portability22 have placed FET sensors as strong candidates in water sensing compared
with fluorescent or electrochemical sensors. However, to the best of our knowledge, FET sensors
have never been applied to PFAS detection.

In this work, we demonstrate the use of a remote gate FET (RGFET) sensor to detect PFOS
in tap water. With this platform, we have achieved ultra-high sensitivity for PFOS detection in tap
water, excellent selectivity against inorganic ions and certain organic pollutants, and promising
sensing reversibility. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies were performed to help
understand the analyte adsorption at the sensing surface. To elucidate the sensing mechanism and
strategize for the further improvement on the specific detection, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were conducted to obtain a molecular level understanding of the interactions between
β-CD, PFOS, and several exemplary interferent molecules. The resulting proof-of-concept,
reversible FET-based PFAS sensor demonstrates the potential of using FET sensors to meet the
urgent need for ultrasensitive, real-time, and continuous PFAS monitoring.

Results
Sensor Design & Characterization
Our RGFET sensing platform consists of three major components (Fig. 1a): a commercial metaloxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, n-type) as the transducer for sensing signals,
a sensing layer on the SiO2/Si substrate called a remote gate (RG, remotely connected with the
gate electrode of the MOSFET) where the sensing events occur, and an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode for stabilizing the global gate potential (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1 for the real
experimental set-up). Compared with conventional back gate FET sensors, RGFET sensors have
fewer side reactions by avoiding direct contact of sample solutions with the transducing channels29,
31

. Two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with high specific surface area and

desirable probe anchoring sites was used as the sensing membrane. β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), a
proven effective probe for PFAS capture via host-guest interactions32-34, was chosen to modify the

rGO surface with the help of a 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) linker
to enhance the sensor specificity to PFOS. The structures of PFOS and mono-NH2-β-CD-PBASE
(β-CD probe + PBASE linker) as well as the equivalent circuit of this platform are shown in Fig.
1a. We quantify the shifts in FET transfer curve as our sensing signals (Fig. 1b), which can be
changed by the surface potential ϕs at the solution/sensing membrane interface during the sensing
process.

(MOSFET) and leads to shifts in the FET transfer curves characterized by the FET threshold
voltage (Vth). c, Comparison of the water contact angles (WCA) of rGO RG electrodes before and

peak of rGO and β-CD RG electrodes. The data in c, d, and e are presented as mean values ± the
standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) for n = 3.
The fabrication of RG electrodes followed a step-by-step process (Supplementary Fig. 2
and Methods). The successful preparation of the desired RG electrodes was confirmed by water
contact angle (WCA) measurement, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Fig. 1c-e). The effective surface modification with β-CD probes
was validated by the significant decrease in the WCA (Fig. 1c) from rGO RG surface (78.1±3.8°)
to β-CD RG surface (19.5±1.6°) owing to the abundant hydroxyl groups in β-CD probes, and the
discernible increase (from rGO RG to β-CD RG) in the ratio of C-O bond, which is a major feature
of the β-CD molecule, to C=C/C–C bond (from 0.37±0.03 to 0.60±0.03) and C=O bond (from
4.51±1.21 to 7.67±0.80) from the XPS C 1s peak (Fig. 1d) and O 1s peak (Fig. 1e). Higher
hydrophilicity is also beneficial to create a stable water/solid interface, which can increase signal
stability and reduce the sensor stabilization time during the measurement. A continuous film
formed by modified rGO flakes and some aggregates can be seen in the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image for β-CD RG surface (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The resulting sensing
layer had a thickness of ~9.3 nm and a surface roughness of ~3.0 nm according to atomic force
microscopy (AFM) analyses (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c).

Characteristics of RGFET sensors & PFOS responses in tap water
After assembling the prepared β-CD RG electrode with MOSFET to construct the RGFET sensing
system, a careful stabilization process was performed before testing any water samples to minimize
the influence of background drift (Supplementary Fig. 5). The threshold voltage (Vth) of RGFET
sensors is sensitive to surface materials due to their work function differences (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 6) resulting either from different material types (e.g., SiOx vs. GO) or charge
transfer after surface conjugation (e.g., pristine rGO vs. β-CD-modified rGO). Surface materials
also have an impact on the transconductance (Gm) of the RGFET (Supplementary Fig. 6) since
their surface charges affect the stabilization process. The β-CD-coated RGFET could maintain a
similar Gm (~88 µS) to that of the pristine MOSFET, suggesting that these surface functionalization
processes didn’t impact the intrinsic sensitivity of the MOSFET device. Prior to the PFOS
detection, our RGFET sensors were first benchmarked against pH interference (Supplementary
Fig. 7). This pH or proton sensitivity (~36 mV/pH) comes from both rGO membranes and monoNH2-β-CD-PBASE groups and cannot be eliminated for this material system. Therefore, a pH
buffer is necessary for sample preparation to ensure a stable pH value during the sensing process.
We observed that our tap water acts as a natural buffer, maintaining a stable pH that does not
change with different concentrations of spiked analytes considered here or during ~one week
sample storage (Supplementary Table 1), and thus the tap water was used to prepare test sample
solutions. The potential applications of six other buffers were also explored, but they were not as
effective as the fresh tap water in terms of generating measurable sensing signals likely due to the
resulting relatively high baseline Vth of the RGFET (Supplementary Discussions 1,2,
Supplementary Figs. 8,9, and Supplementary Tables 1,2).

(pH=7 buffer) with Vth defined at a drain-source current of 1×10-6 A and used to quantify the

the concentrations in b and c refer to the additional PFOS concentrations spiked into the blank tap
water. The real PFOS concentration is the sum of the background PFOS in the blank tap water and
the additionally spiked PFOS. The sensor response ΔVth reported here is derived from the
differential response between spiked and blank tap water samples. The data in c are presented as
mean values ± S.E.M. for n = 3-6.
The accuracy of PFOS concentrations is critical to obtaining a reliable calibration curve.
To this end, the standard EPA methods (see Methods section) for drinking water (LC-MS/MS) was
used to check the real concentrations of prepared PFOS samples and the results show that the
measured concentrations of most samples are close to the targeted concentrations (Supplementary
Table 3). Although there are low background PFOS concentrations in the blank tap water (~ 2 ppt
measured by LC-MS/MS), their interactions with the sensing surface have already been

equilibrated after the sensor stabilization process, and adding blank tap water does not produce
any further sensing signal (Supplementary Fig. 10). Thus, we attribute the observed sensor
responses to the adsorption of additionally spiked PFOS.
Fig. 2b shows the representative transfer curves for PFOS at different concentrations,
where we can see the transfer curves shift to the higher VG direction when relative PFOS
concentrations increase from zero (blank tap water) to a saturation point around 100 ppt, and then
shift back after saturation (from 100 ppt to 10 ppb). The decreasing signals after saturation are
typical of FET device, which could be attributed to the synergistic effects of the increased ion
concentrations, multilayer analyte adsorption, and the decreased Δσ (surface charge density
change)-dependence of the Δϕs in certain regions of the σ-ϕs curve after the saturation point
according to the Grahame equation35 (Supplementary Discussion 2).
The sensor’s response curve for PFOS in tap water is presented in Fig. 2c. The detection
range of this device is from a few hundred of ppq to around 100 ppt, which matches well with the
realistic concentration range of PFOS in natural waters8. The reporting limit (RL, defined as the
reported lowest PFOS concentration that can be detected in this work) of this device is around 250
ppq and reaches a level lower than the USEPA’s MCL for PFOS (4 ppt), suggesting the superior
sensitivity of the sensors.

Selectivity and reversibility
To better evaluate the application potential of our sensing platform, the selectivity of our RGFET
sensing devices against structural analogues (OA, OSA, PFO, and PFOA), representatives of
organic dyes (MB), disinfection byproducts (TCAA), and common inorganic ions (Na2SO4,
10

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-6q6q5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4444-2487 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

K2HPO4, CaCl2) in tap water was measured at the same molar concentrations (0.2 nM) for all
analytes (Fig. 3a). The results show that our sensors possess outstanding selectivity (i.e., no
response) against inorganic ions, moderate selectivity (~20-30% of the PFOS signal) against MB,
TCAA, and PFOA, and relatively poor selectivity (~50% of the PFOS signal) against some
structural analogues like OSA. Sensor testing at higher interferent concentrations (0.2 nM – 2000
nM for organic interferents; 100 ppb – 10 ppm for inorganic ions) and environmentally relevant
PFOS concentrations (1–100 ppt) were also performed as a stress test (Supplementary Fig. 11).
The signal for PFOS at 10 ppt (20 pM) was compared to the responses for organics at 20 nM and
inorganic ions at 1 ppm (environmentally relevant concentrations of these ions36), and the results
indicated our sensors can maintain moderate selectivity against all these interferents even when
their concentrations are more than 103 times higher than the PFOS concentration (Supplementary
Fig. 12). Sensor response of a common co-existing surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), was
recorded as well in the range of 100 ppt to 1 ppm. Our devices showed strong responses to SDS,
and there was almost no selectivity between PFOS and SDS (Supplementary Fig. 13), which
indicates that we need to either modify the β-CD probe to introduce more favorable interactions
towards PFAS such as fluorophilic interaction32, 37, 38 or find better surface capture probes to
enhance the sensor selectivity against especially challenging interferents like SDS.

presented as mean values ± S.E.M. for n = 3-6.
Sensing signals of FET devices not only depend on analyte adsorption but are also
influenced by the charge properties of different analytes, sensing materials, and buffers. QCM with
dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), which monitors in real time the mass changes on the surface
through detecting resonance frequency change, can help us understand the adsorption-related
analyte/surface interactions in buffers40, 41.To simulate the sensing surface, similar rGO films were
deposited on QCM sensors (Supplementary Fig. 14), which have comparable surface
hydrophobicity (~78.3°), surface roughness (~3.8 nm), and layer thickness (~7.4 nm) to that of the
RGFET sensor surface. We monitored the surface functionalization processes of PBASE linker
and NH2-β-CD probe and calculated their surface probe densities to be 1.7 molecules/nm2 and 1.8
molecules/nm2, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 15,16).
PFOS samples prepared in both PBS buffer and fresh tap water were flowed across the
simulated sensor surface to investigate if PFOS adsorption is a determining factor for the different
sensing signals of RGFET in PBS buffer (no signal) and in tap water (strong signals). At selected
concentrations (0.02 mM, 0.2 mM, 1 mM), PFOS adsorption occurs in both buffers, which
suggests that adsorption is not the cause for undetectable sensing signals in PBS. However, the
13

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-6q6q5 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4444-2487 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

adsorbed PFOS density in tap water is higher than that in the PBS buffer (Fig. 3b,c and
Supplementary Fig. 17). We suspect that the enhanced PFOS adsorption in tap water could be
related to the pre-deposited species from tap water on the QCM sensor surface during the QCM
baseline stabilization process (Supplementary Fig. 18), because tap water has many divalent
cations and hydrocarbons that can potentially enhance the electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions with PFOS42, respectively.
The adsorption densities of four analytes in tap water, including PFOS, SDS, TCAA, and
MB, were also compared to elucidate the mechanism behind the selectivity of our RGFET sensors
(Supplementary Fig. 19 and Fig. 3d). PFOS and SDS have similar adsorption densities (except at
0.02 mM where the adsorption of PFOS is greater), indicating that SDS and PFOS may have
similar binding affinities toward the sensing surface. In contrast, adsorption of TCAA was not
observed by QCM, which may explain the weaker sensing signal of TCAA in our RGFET sensors
as adsorption is the first step. However, MB exhibits even higher adsorption density than PFOS
and SDS (especially at lower concentrations) despite its much weaker sensing response. This
suggests that the sensing signals for MB in RGFET sensors are governed by not only the adsorption
of MB but also its charge property. Overall, the findings from the QCM studies emphasize the
important roles of analyte adsorption, analyte charge properties, and buffer properties in registering
enough sensing signal.
The observed reversible adsorption/desorption process of PFOS through QCM at the
simulated sensor surface in tap water (Fig. 3b) also suggests the reversible sensing potential of our
RGFET sensors. This is further demonstrated using our RGFET devices with real-time responses
to fluctuating PFOS concentrations, which indicates that PFOS sensing signals can be readily
reversed by simply washing the surface with blank tap water (Fig. 3e). After three cycles, the
14

sensors can maintain ~80-90% of the original PFOS responses in the 1st cycle (Fig. 3f), suggesting
the potential of our RGFET sensors for on-site and continuous PFOS monitoring applications.

MD simulations of the interaction between analytes and the β-CD probe
All-atom classical MD simulations were employed to gain molecular-level insight into the
structure and thermodynamics of the bound complex between the PFOS analyte or the interferents
SDS and TCAA with β-CD probes, identify preferred bound configurations, and resolve the
molecular basis for probe sensitivity and selectivity for PFOS (Fig. 4). The free energy landscape
for binding of the PFOS, SDS, and TCAA with a β-CD probe was mapped out through the potential
of mean force (PMF) (r, z) describing the relative free energy of different (r, z) configurations of
the probe-target system in the radial separation r and axial separation z of the molecular centers of
mass within a coordinate frame centered on the cyclodextrin probe (Fig. 4d and Supplementary
Fig. 20). It can be seen from Fig. 4a-c that β-CD’s ∼0.65 nm diameter cavity is sufficiently large
to accommodate any of PFOS, SDS, or TCAA within the cavity, and in all cases the
thermodynamically preferred state is for the target guest to reside within the cavity of the probe
host. For quantitative comparison, we then calculated the values of the standard state (i.e., at a
concentration of 𝐶 𝛩 = 1 M) binding free energy ΔGΘ and binding constant Kb for each of the three
systems (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 21, and Supplementary Tables 4,5). 𝐾𝑏𝑃𝐹𝑂𝑆 (~106, which is
in approximate agreement with the experimental value43 of ~105) is approximately one order of
magnitude larger than 𝐾𝑏𝑆𝐷𝑆 and almost five orders of magnitude larger than 𝐾𝑏𝑇𝐶𝐴𝐴 . The results are
generally consistent with the trend of surface adsorption densities observed in QCM studies where
the adsorption of PFOS and SDS are much greater than that of TCAA on β-CD functionalized

sensing surface. Although the calculated binding constant for PFOS is one order of magnitude
greater than that of SDS, the observed similar adsorption from QCM and similar sensor signals
from RGFET sensors for PFOS and SDS could be attributed to their non-specific adsorption onto
the rGO membrane, averaging the adsorption behavior.

zero. The location (r = 0 nm, z = 0 nm) corresponds to a configuration in which the target molecule
resides within the pore of the probe and the centers of mass of the target and that of the oxygen
and carbon atoms in the narrow-side plane of each of the 6-sided D-glucose units of the β-CD
probe are coincident. The white region in each plot corresponds to the prohibited region due to
excluded volume overlaps of the target molecule and the cylindrical wall of the probe. The white
region around the edge of each plot corresponds to the far-field region that was unsampled under
our funnel meta dynamics approach that focused computational sampling on the near-field region.
In all cases the narrow end of the β-CD probe is oriented towards positive z values and the broader
end towards negative z values. Molecular snapshots corresponding to the thermodynamically
preferred bound configuration are presented for each system viewed from the side and above
(narrow side facing up). All renderings were constructed using VMD 1.9.444.

Spatially resolved selectivity (Fig. 4e,f) permits a greater understanding of differences in
binding mechanisms and affinities. The fluorinated backbone of the PFOS molecule appears to
elicit strong van der Waals interactions with the cavity walls. In comparison, the hydrogens along
the backbone of SDS appear not to interact with the entirety of the cavity of the β-CD probe as
efficiently as PFOS. These differences in van der Waals radii of fluorine versus hydrogen result in
a relatively rigid PFOS molecule in the β-CD cavity, only able to access a limited number of
strongly bound configurations and a looser fit of SDS in the cavity, and promote strong selectivity
for PFOS near the center of the cavity (𝑠 = √𝑟 2 + 𝑧 2 < 0.4 nm) where the mean ∆PMFPFOS-SDS (r,
z) ≈ -7.26±0.05 kJ/mol (Fig. 4e). Further away from the origin in the region 0.4 nm < s < 1.1 nm,
binding of SDS is preferable to PFOS with a mean ∆PMFPFOS-SDS (r, z) ≈ 6.36±0.05 kJ/mol. In
the far field regime for s > 1.1 nm, ∆PMFPFOS-SDS (r, z) approaches 0 kJ/mol as expected. We
propose that this spatially resolved selectivity may be valuable in guiding rational engineering of
the probe to promote stronger PFOS-β-CD interactions relative to SDS-β-CD interactions over the
full range of binding positions.

In contrast, ∆PMFPFOS-TCAA (r, z) is negative over the entire s < 1.2 nm region of bound
configurations, indicating a global preference for PFOS relative to TCAA over all binding sites on
the probe (Fig. 4f). This can likely be understood as the longer PFOS backbone providing stronger
van der Waals interactions with the interior probe wall than the relatively smaller TCAA. The
larger van der Waals radius of the chlorines on the backbone of TCAA relative to the hydrogens
on the SDS backbone limit the ease of TCAA passing through the β-CD cavity. Consequently,
TCAA does not benefit from the large number of possible bound configurations with the β-CD
probe that SDS does. This effect, combined with the shortness of the TCAA chain, two carbons
compared with eight for PFOS, produces an overall weaker binding affinity of TCAA with β-CD
compared with PFOS.
Finally, inspection of the PFOS/β-CD bound complex indicated that the fluorinated
backbone tends to occupy the cavity leaving the charged head exposed into solvent. This suggests
that there may be an opportunity to further enhance the PFOS binding constant by engineering the
lip (especially at the broader opening side of the probe as suggested by the thermodynamically
preferred binding conformation) of the β-CD probe to promote favorable interactions (potentially
electrostatic interactions) with the PFOS head and/or modifying the interior wall of β-CD cavity
to strengthen the interactions with the PFOS backbone (potentially through fluorophilic
interactions).

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the reversible and fast detection (< 2 min) of PFOS in untreated tap water
using an RGFET sensor with β-CD-modified rGO as the sensing surface. The RGFET sensor

exhibits a reporting limit of ~250 ppq, which is much lower than the MCL of 4 ppt for PFOS set
by the USEPA, and a detection range from 100s ppq to 100s ppt that matches well with
environmentally relevant PFOS concentrations. The reversible adsorption of PFOS at the sensing
surface in tap water was validated by QCM. Our sensors showed excellent selectivity against
common inorganic ions in tap water and good-to-moderate selectivity against several organic
interferents like TCAA. However, the limited selectivity against certain structural analogues like
SDS suggests the need of molecular probe engineering to enhance the selectivity by hindering the
adsorption of such interferents. The spatially resolved selectivity from all-atom MD calculations
suggests a global binding preference of β-CD for PFOS over TCAA, and further suggests that a
higher selectivity toward PFOS against SDS can be achieved if the binding sites for both analytes
can be restricted to the area close to the center of the β-CD cavity. Future work should focus on
enhancing the selectivity by rational engineering of the rim/interior wall of the β-CD, applying
other selective probes, and/or making sensor arrays, thereby realizing the full potential of this FET
sensing platform for ultrasensitive, selective, on-site and continuous monitoring of PFOS in water.

Methods
Fabrication and characterization of RG electrodes
The fabrication of RG electrodes was modified from previous work29. Firstly, a silicon wafer
(University Wafer, P-type B doped 4" Si Wafers w/ 300 nm Wet Thermal Oxide) was sonicated in
acetone (Sigma-Aldrich) and isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min sequentially. After being
dried under N2, the wafer was treated with oxygen plasma for 120 s, and then sonicated in
deionized (DI) water for 5 min. The cleaned wafer was immediately immersed in a 5 vol% APTES
20

(Sigma-Aldrich) ethanolic solution for ~ 2 h. The resulting wafer was rinsed with ethanol and dried
with N2. A monolayer GO dispersion (ACS Material, 10 mg/mL in water) was diluted with DI to
form a 0.24 mg/mL solution, which was sonicated for ~ 30 min before use. After preheating the
cleaned wafer on a hot plate at 120 °C for ~20 min, ~16.4 mL of the diluted GO dispersion was
poured onto the wafer surface to cover the whole area of the wafer while keeping heating the wafer
at 120 °C. After all the water in the GO dispersion evaporated, the resulting GO coatings showed
two distinct areas with blue and black colors, corresponding to few-layer GO and GO film,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 3a). Only the thinner area (few-layer GO) was used for further
modification. The coated wafer was cut into small pieces (each having ≥1 cm2 surface area to
hold sample droplets) and annealed in a tube furnace (Thermo Scientific Lindberg/Blue M MiniMite) at 400 °C under N2 for 1 h. Afterward, the rGO-coated chips were immersed in 10 mg/mL
PBASE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) solution in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2
h and then rinsed with DMF and dried with N2. Finally, 10 mM NH2-β-CD (BOC Sciences) water
solution was added onto the PBASE-modified chips and reacted overnight (~15-18 h). Rinsing the
chips with DI and drying them using N2 gave the final β-CD RG electrodes.
Water contact angle (WCA) measurements were conducted using a tensimeter (Biolin
Scientific Theta Flex) to determine the surface hydrophobicity of the prepared RG electrodes.
Raman microscopy (Renishaw inVia) was used to confirm the deposition of GO/rGO. XPS
measurements were conducted to analyze the surface chemical compositions (Thermo Fisher kAlpha+, using the Thermo Fisher Avantage software (v.5.977, Build 06436) for data processing
and analysis). The obtained XPS spectra were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The X-ray
source was microfocused monochromatic Al Kα (1,487 eV) with a spot size of 400 μm. A pass
energy of 200.0 eV and a step size of 1.000 eV were used for the survey scan, and a pass energy

of 50.0 eV and a step size of 0.100 eV were used for a high-resolution scan. The deconvolution of
high-resolution XPS spectra was performed by the Powell peak fitting algorithm with mixed
Gaussian–Lorentzian line shapes and a Smart background. Surface morphology was characterized
by SEM at 3 kV (FEI Nova 600 NanoLab focused ion beam SEM). The surface roughness and
thickness of rGO RG and β-CD RG were measured using AFM (Cypher-ES and MFP-3D models,
Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments) in tapping mode. AC240TSA-R3 (Oxford Instruments)
tips with a typical resonant frequency of 70 (50−90) kHz, tip radius of 7 nm, and spring constant
of 2 (0.6–3.5) N/m were used for Cypher-ES and PPP-NCHR (NanosensorsTM) tips with a typical
resonant frequency of 330 (204–497) kHz, tip radius of <10 nm, and spring constant of 42 (10 –
130) N/m were used for MFP-3D.

Preparation and analysis of analyte samples
To prepare PFOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) samples for sensor testing, 10 mg PFOS was
dissolved in 100 mL blank buffers in HDPE bottles (Thermo Scientific) to form a stock solution
of 100 ppm and sonicated at 40 °C for 30 min. This stock solution was then diluted step-by-step
to produce PFOS solutions with targeted concentrations from 1 ppq to 10 ppb in 15 mL PP tubes
(VWR). For QCM samples, a stock solution of 1,000 ppm was made by adding 10 mg PFOS in 10
mL blank buffers in 15 mL PP tubes (VWR), which was further diluted to form solutions from
0.02 mM to 1 mM in 15 mL PP tubes (VWR). We note that the concentrations used in the QCM
study are higher than those in the sensor testing due to the lower detection limit of the QCM
instrument; yet, QCM tests provide relevant mechanistic insights by comparing the adsorption
behavior at the same concentrations under various situations. After preparing samples at each
concentration and before further dilution, the resulting solution was sonicated at 40 °C for 30 min.

For the buffers, fresh tap water was collected at our labs located at Argonne National Laboratory.
PBS, MES, and Bis-Tris buffers (0.1x or 0.01x) were prepared by diluting the stock solution or
solids (all from Sigma-Aldrich) in DI water. The pH of each prepared sample was tested using a
pH meter (OHAUS™ Aquasearcher™ pH Meter AB41PH) to make sure the pH is the same for all
the samples prepared in the same buffer. All the samples were freshly prepared before sensor
testing and would not be stored over 1 week except the one that was deliberately kept > 1 week to
investigate the influence of tap water storage. Other analyte solutions including SDS, OA, OSA,
PFO, PFOA, MB, TCAA, Na2SO4, K2HPO4, and CaCl2 (all from Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared
and stored in the same way as for PFOS samples.
PFOS concentrations were measured using LC-MS/MS. low concentration samples
between 1-100 ppt, solid phase (SPE) extraction was used. Before SPE, the internal standard,
MPFAC-24ES, was aliquoted to the sample containers as received to obtain an expected
concentration of 40 ng/L. SPE was performed on the experimental samples corresponding QC
samples (Laboratory Blank, Laboratory Fortified Blank, and Laboratory Fortified Sample Matrix).
4 mL of 1% methanolic ammonium was passed through the WAX cartridges for final extraction
and captured into respective 15 mL falcon tubes. Each sample was diluted to 4 mL final volumes
using 0.3% methanolic ammonium hydroxide. 10 µL of acetic acid was aliquoted to each sample
for pH adjustment. It was assumed that all PFOS and internal standard reached the 4 mL final
volume extraction.
For high concentration samples more than 100 ppt, aliquots were diluted to a final volume
of 10 mL (1000x dilution) with the 1:1 reagent water: methanol solution. Due to the high
concentration of the 100 ppm and 500 ppm samples, secondary dilutions were performed. The
internal standard, MPFAC-24ES, was aliquoted to each experimental sample for an expected

concentration of 200 ppt. After addition of internal standard, the experimental samples were
filtered using pre-cleaned 0.2-micron filters. Finally, 10 µL of acetic acid was added to each sample
for pH adjustment.
Calibration standards and QC samples for LC/MS/MS analysis were prepared with the
native standard solutions (PFAC30-PAR) and mass-labeled isotopic standard solutions (internal
standards; MPFAC-24ES, M3HFPO-DA) from Wellington Laboratories, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
PFAC30-PAR contains 36 PFAS compounds at 1.0 µg/mL each. MPFAC-24ES contains 19 masslabeled PFAS compounds at 1.0 µg mL-1 each, and M3HFPO-DA contains one mass-labeled
PFAS compound at 50 µg/mL. Calibration concentrations ranged from 5 to 10,000 ng/L (ppt) for
each analyte present in the native standard solutions. Aliquots (200 µL) from the calibration
standards, QC samples (calibration blanks and calibration controls), and all experimental samples
(4 mL extracts) were transferred to LC vials directly prior to the injection sequence. All samples
were vortexed before aliquoted to vials. Samples were analyzed on a Waters LC/MS Micro run
time with a starting and ending eluent composition of 98% Eluent B (2 mM ammonium acetate in
95:5 water: acetonitrile) and 2% Eluent A (HPLC grade acetonitrile). Calibration was calculated
for all analytes with compound analysis being accepted for calibration curves of R2 (>0.99) for
each analyte. The Minimum Reporting Limit (MRL) for the analyte was established by the lowest
concentration calibration standard that agrees within 50% of the true concentration. All collected
data resulted in concentrations above the MRL, satisfying the QC requirement. Final
Concentrations of QC samples and experimental samples have passed QC requirements. Results
are reported as Total PFOS (TPFOS).
The selected cation concentrations in the tap water were analyzed using an inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific, iCAP PRO X ICP-OES Duo).

The carbon contents in the tap water were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer
(Shimadzu, TOC-L). These measurements were done following the standard operating procedure
of each instrument.

Sensor testing
A commercial Si-based n-type MOSFET (CD4007UB) was connected to the fabricated RG
electrodes and used as a transducer. During the measurement, one drop (~30 µL) of sample solution
was placed on the RG surface and connected with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Gamry
Instruments) to apply the gate bias for all measurements (Supplementary Fig. 1c). All transfer
curves were measured using either a Keithley 4200A or a Keysight B1500A semiconductor
analyzer with a drain voltage set at 50 mV and gate voltages scanning from 0 to 1.5 V. Transfer
curves of the RGFET were repeatedly measured for 20 cycles for each sample droplet. The Vth
was calculated as the gate voltage corresponding to drain current of 1 μA in each transfer curve.
The Vth of the 20th cycle was used for data comparison. The Gm of each RGFET was calculated at
its maximum value.
Sensor stabilization using the baseline solution (the blank buffer) was performed before
any sample measurement (Supplementary Fig. 5). For the samples with the same analyte but
different concentrations (Fig. 2b,c), a series of solutions were added onto and removed from the
RG surfaces sequentially from lowest concentrations to highest concentrations. For the selectivity
test at 0.2 nM, analyte solutions including PFOS and other interferents were added onto and
removed from the same RG surfaces one-by-one with thorough washing steps using blank tap
water between different samples (the adsorption of all organic interferents is reversible at 0.2 nM

except the MB, which should be added at last in the sample sequence). For selectivity stress test,
responses for PFOS at 1 ppt, 10 ppt and 100 ppt, organic interferents at 0.2 nM, 20 nM and 2,000
nM and inorganic ions at 100 ppb, 1 ppm and 10 ppm were recorded individually for different
analytes to avoid potential irreversible adsorption at high concentrations.

QCM
The preparation of rGO-coated QCM sensor chips (Supplementary Fig.14) was modified from
previous work by Melendrez et al.41. A gold QCM sensor (Biolin Scientific) was first sonicated in
2 wt.% SDS solutions and then in ethanol for 5 min. The chip was then treated with air plasma for
30 min. Afterward, 200 µL of 5 mg/mL GO ethanolic dispersion was spin-coated onto the QCM
sensor surface at 2,000 rpm for 2.5 min (Laurell Technologies Corporation, model WS-650MZ23NPP). Thermal annealing was conducted later at 180 °C for 6 h to sufficiently reduce GO to
rGO while protecting the gold layer from destruction.
QCM measurements were performed using a QSense Analyzer (Biolin Scientific),
recording 7 frequencies and dissipations. A stabilization process was conducted before any QCM
measurements using the baseline solution at a flow rate of 300 µL/min until the drifting is less than
1 Hz/h. PBASE functionalization was monitored in-situ on rGO-coated QCM sensors using a 10
mg/mL solution in DMF for 2 h and then was washed thoroughly with DMF until the signal became
flat. Afterward, the flowing solution was switched to DI water for a new round of baseline
stabilization, then the NH2-β-CD functionalization was recorded in-situ using a 0.2 mM solution
in DI for ~ 17 h, and finally the surface was washed with copious DI flow until all the weaklybounded molecules being removed. This two-step surface functionalization was recorded at a flow

rate of 25 µL/min at room temperature. The adsorption and desorption of PFOS, SDS, MB, and
TCAA were performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 100 µL/min on β-CD-modified rGOcoated gold sensor surface. After flowing each sample solution, allow enough time for the
adsorption to reach equilibrium state and then switch to the blank buffer solution for desorption
until completion. The raw QCM data were fitted with various models built in the QSense Dfind
software (all the frequencies and dissipations except the f1 and D1 were used in fitting) to obtain
the surface mass density change curves, which were then converted to surface probe/analyte
density curves by dividing the mass density by the molar mass of each target. The results from
different model fitting were compared and the final model chosen for each measurement was
determined by considering both the fitting quality and the real circumstances (material properties,
adsorption nature, maximum allowable surface density, etc.). The maximum adsorbed analyte
densities for different measurements were calculated and used for comparison.

MD simulations
Simulations were conducted using the GROMACS 2021.6 simulation suite45 employing the
General Amber Force Field (GAFF2)46 and the TIP3P water model47. To improve sampling of
complex formation, we combined funnel metadynamics48, 49 with well-tempered parallel bias
metadynamics (PBMetaD)50 implemented within PLUMED 2.8.151. We used these calculations to
recover an unbiased estimate of the potential of mean force, PMF(r, z), describing the relative free
energy of various configurations of the probe-target system parameterized by the radial separation
r and axial separation z of the molecular centers of mass within a coordinate frame centered on the
β-CD probe (Fig. 4d, and Supplementary Fig. 20). These PMFs enable us to identify both the
thermodynamically preferred binding locations for the PFOS analyte and SDS and TCAA
