Abstract
The proliferation of plastic production has led to a surge in nanoplastics (NPs) pollution, posing
significant environmental and health risks. Despite efforts to mitigate plastic waste, NPs persist as
a significant challenge due to their small size, high surface-to-volume ratio, and complex nature.
This review explores advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as promising techniques for NP
remediation, including ozonation, electrochemical, photocatalytic, and plasma-induced processes.
Existing research is analyzed to investigate the performance of AOPs in NP degradation. Gaps in
the development of effective processes and analytical methods are highlighted, and future
directions are suggested. This review aims to enhance understanding and promote sustainable
solutions for the remediation of NPs from contaminated water resources in alignment with the
objectives outlined in the sixth Sustainable Development Goal set by the United Nations.

1. Introduction
The introduction of the concept of polymerization by Herman Staudinger in 1920 led to a better
understanding of polymer chemistry and, therefore, to the more massive production of plastic
worldwide [1]. Plastic has multifaceted properties, such as low thermal conductivity, lightweight,
ease of preparation, ability to take different forms and shapes, and tunable mechanical properties
[2]

. For these reasons, plastic is an essential component of various materials in applications such as

agriculture, textiles, medical and electronic devices, personal care products, vehicles, packaging,
toys, etc. [3]. The high demand for plastic materials is reflected by global plastics production, which
has significantly increased over the past 60 years, from 15 million tons in 1964 to 400.3 million
tons in 2022, and continuing at this pace, it is expected to duplicate over the next 20 years [4–6]. On
top of this, recent research studies indicate that the recent COVID-19 pandemic increased even
more plastic needs [7].
Although the plastic production continues to increase, the recycling rate remains low. Studies
have shown that only 9 % of the yearly produced plastic waste is recycled, with the rest ending up
in the environment through various pathways [8,9]. Even though multiple efforts have been made
so far to pose some management policies for the limitation of plastic waste through the control of
plastic production, utilization and end of life, the use of biodegradable plastics, and the
improvement of the recycling processes [3], there is still a considerable amount of plastic waste
present in the environment.
Oceans and rivers are estimated to receive nearly 13 million tons of plastic waste annually [10].
Plastic debris in water bodies is present in the form of macroplastics (>1cm), mesoplastics (1–10
mm), microplastics (MPs, 1-1000 µm), and nanoplastics (NPs). Plastic particles with sizes below
1 µm are generally considered as NPs; however, for the sake of conformity with the definitions of

nanomaterials, Hartmann et al. [11] recently proposed the subdivision to submicron-plastics with
sizes ranging between 100 nm and 1 µm and NPs with sizes below 100 nm. Nonetheless, the
present review considers NPs as plastic particles with sizes smaller than 1 µm.
Recent research suggests that MPs and NPs exacerbate environmental pollution due to their
destructive effects on aquatic organisms and human health. It has been proved that MPs and NPs
can affect the growth rate of marine organisms and enhance their mortality rate [2], while on a
cellular scale, they can cause gene expression variations and a high cell death rate [12,13]. NPs and
MPs may accumulate in the organs and cause some disorders in living bodies. In contrast, NPs can
quickly enter the bloodstream due to their small size, permeate cellular barriers or cell membranes,
and alter their functionalities [12].
For the above reasons, NPs are emerging water pollutants of significant concern even in low
environmental concentrations. Their characteristics make it challenging to perform on-site
detection and monitoring, study their environmental and biological fate, and evaluate processes
for their remediation. Various advanced characterization methods have been developed to contrast
the difficulties of detecting and analyzing such organic particles [14],demonstrating their capability
to efficiently track small amounts of NPs in impure samples [14,15]. Although significant steps
forward have been made, current studies on the NPs’ fate are mainly conducted using artificial
NPs and controlled environments, with the risk of missing some critical parameters for the
transition from the laboratory to the environmental conditions.
Due to their small size, non-biodegradable nature, and presence in complex water bodies, NPs
are very difficult to be removed from the water environment. Nonetheless, water treatment
technologies that have demonstrated the ability to remove NPs of well-known chemistry from
controlled, artificial environments have been recently reported, such as adsorption/aggregation

[16,17]

, coagulation [18], flocculation [19,20], sedimentation [21], biological [22] and membrane filtration

[23]

. Nonetheless, most of these methods can remove NPs only partially from water samples. At the

same time, some of the remediation processes, such as coagulation/flocculation, require the
presence of additional chemicals in the systems, which may produce secondary pollution. To
address these problems, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been recently reported to be
among the most promising methods for the remediation of NPs, as they can provoke the
mineralization of MPs and NPs while producing limited secondary pollution [24].
AOPs, such as electrochemical [25], ozonation [26], and photocatalytic [27–30] processes, are newly
emerged methods in the field of NPs degradation. However, the small size of the NPs and their
complex organic nature limit their characterization and analysis during the treatment process.
Therefore, diagnosing potential problems to achieve highly efficient degradation of NPs using
AOPs remains a challenge. To do so, data collected from the recently published studies should be
reported, compared, and commented on. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current
literature lacks a review article that assesses the effectiveness of AOPs in degrading nano-sized
(<1 µm) plastic particles and explores recently applied characterization methods.
Hence, herein, we review the available research studies focused on AOPs for the degradation
of NPs in water. We offer a critical discussion on their feasibility and effectiveness and a general
perspective for future works. In this context, we first focus on I) the sources of NPs and their
hazards as water contaminants, II) the use of different remediation strategies for the degradation
of NPs, III) the applied AOPs on the in situ degradation of NPs, and IV) the current research gaps
and perspectives in degrading NPs through AOPs. With this review paper, we aim to highlight and
optimize the potentiality of sustainable AOP methods in the degradation of NPs and to give an

overall view of the effective characterization and analysis methods to promote accuracy in this
field.

2. Principal sources and hazards of NPs
MPs and NPs are classified as primary or secondary depending on their sources. Primary plastic
particles are components of market products, and they enter the environment directly through these
products. Industrial abrasives, cosmetics and exfoliating personal care products, adhesives,
electronics, paints, and drug delivery medical devices are well-known examples of commercially
available products that contain primary MPs and NPs [12,13,31]. Alternatively, all the discarded
plastic products, such as plastic bags, bottles, ropes, fishing nets, food packaging, and electronics,
can be sources of secondary MPs and NPs [31,32]. These particles derive from the breakdown of
plastic debris caused by physical, chemical, and biological actions such as hydrolysis,
photodegradation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation [32,33]. For instance, Lambort et al. [34]
proved that polystyrene (PS) coffee cups could be degraded to MPs and subsequently to NPs under
UV and visible light irradiation. In addition, Prenner et al. [35] demonstrated that rubber tires can
produce NPs during constant friction in particular driving conditions (high speed and sharp brake)
[36]

. Accordingly, a study has shown that in 2018 in Austria, about 6% of the used rubber tires were

emitted into the air as micro- and nano-sized particles [35]. Moreover, Dawson et al. [37] reported
that the Antarctic krill can transform MPs into NPs through digestive fragmentation, proving that
NPs can be generated by ingesting MPs in marine species.
Regarding environmental pollution, the distribution of NPs in water has become an emerging
environmental issue. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the significant sources of NPs in water. Water
bodies are polluted by macroplastics and MPs wastes, which are produced directly through sea-

based activities (e.g., fishing gears) but also land-based activities, such as inadequate waste
disposal and management, industrial activities, municipal sewage and sludge, tire abrasion, and
surface waters runoff, and eventually pass to the oceans through different pathways like wind,
water, and soil [38,39] Chemical, physical, and biological transformation of such plastic litter in
water results in NPs [33,37]. In addition, although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) limit the
dispersion of water pollutants, they can be a significant source of MPs and NPs. Concerning MPs,
it is estimated that 25% of the globally released MPs in the environment are attributed to the
WWTPs [10]. In the case of NPs, although there is no precise information about the amount, such
small particles can undoubtedly pass through the various water treatment stages and be released
together with the MPs in the environment or can even be generated from the fragmentation of the
MPs, through shear stress forces during the treatment processes [10].
A recent study on the biological fate of NPs of two different sizes (i.e., 50 and 500 nm) showed
that the nonfunctionalized PS NPs of larger size (500 nm) can be accumulated in the digestive
organs of aquatic animals. In contrast, smaller NPs (50 nm) can penetrate tissues, cause immune
system disorders, and increase marine organisms' growth rate [40]. In addition, the functional groups
and the high surface area of NPs allow the adsorption and transport of various water pollutants
such as heavy metals or endocrine disruptors (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate, bisphenol A), as well
as the effective release of various endogenous pollutants originating from the components used in
the production of plastic [41].
Concerning human exposure, as depicted in Fig. 1, NPs may enter the human organs through
ingestion, inhalation, and dermal adsorption [42]. Dermal adsorption of NPs can occur using
personal skin care products containing such NPs. On the other hand, ingestion of plastic NPs is
likely the main pathway of entry into human organs since they can be ingested by consuming

contaminated food, like seafood, salt, and beer, or by drinking contaminated water [42,43]. Their
small size, high surface area, and surface charge will likely raise diverse adverse effects. Recent
experimental findings suggest that NPs can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative
diseases. In-vivo studies on mice proved that the oral ingestion of NPs (30–50 nm) may reach the
brain tissue and induce cognitive dysfunction [44]. Moreover, in vitro studies proved that NPs (30
nm) can penetrate human neural stem cells through endocytosis, where they accumulate, leading
to decreased cell proliferation and eventually death [45]. Marfella [46] carried out an in-depth
observational study on the correlation between the presence of MPs and NPs in the carotid artery
and a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. To do so, they focused on patients undergoing
surgery for carotid artery disease. Upon analysis, it was found that out of 257 patients, 150 had
polyethylene particles in their carotid artery plaques (21.7 ± 24.5 μg/mg of plaque), while 31
patients had polyvinyl chloride (5.2 ± 2.4 μg/mg of plaque).

3. Remediation strategies for NPs contamination in water
There is increasing evidence that drinking water is contaminated with plastic particles, making
it a significant source of human exposure [47]. Kosuth et al. [48] studied the presence of MPs in tap
and bottled water. Samples from 14 countries were subjected to vacuum filtration (cut-off: 2.5
μm), and the filters were visually assessed using a dissecting microscope. The results showed that
81% and 93% of the tap and bottled water samples, respectively, were contaminated with MPs,

mostly with fibers of length ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 mm. Moreover, Li et al. [47] have recently
shown the existence of NPs in tap water. The collected samples, subjected to successive filtration
steps, revealed the presence of NPs with concentrations ranging between 1.67 and 2.08 μg L-1,
depending on their size (from 255 nm to 58 nm), with most of them composed of PS, polyvinyl
chloride, polyolefins, and polyamide. Furthermore, Huang et al. [49] analyzed polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) bottled water using a tangential flow ultrafiltration system. The final retentate
fluid was examined through a new nanorod-M super-resolution optical microscopy system
equipped with a super-resolution microsphere amplifying lens. Their results revealed the presence
of organic particles in the water with sizes in the micron, submicron, and nanosized range. In brief,
NPs can be found in potable water, either surviving different water treatment processes or being
released from the plastic bottles where they are stored. Therefore, there is an essential need to
control and eliminate their presence through efficient water treatment processes. This section
reviews some recently published papers on removing NPs following standard water treatment
methods like coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, and bioremediation.
Since coagulation or flocculation methods are the typical first steps in water purification, they
have also been considered for removing NPs from contaminated water. Chen et al. [20] declared the
high potential of Mg and Al-based layered double hydroxides (Mg/Al-LDHs) for the flocculation
of PS NPs with sizes ranging between 0.05 and 0.10 μm. In particular, it has been demonstrated
that at specific pH values, during the flocculation process Mg/Al-LDHs can be formed in situ, and
simultaneously, during their formation can capture existing PS NPs in their layers. Such Mg/Al
flocculants can remove about 90.0% of the PS NPs by the liquid media. However, a significant
challenge for the practical application of this method is the need to separate the LDH-encapsulated
NPs from the treated water. Alternatively, Zhang et al. [18] studied the removal of fluorescent PS

13

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r15f3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-9713 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

NPs (180 nm) from drinking water through coagulation-flocculation combined with sedimentation
(CFS). As reported, even with the coagulant help, the NPs were not removed upon the application
of CFS. Their results point toward a general rule that such water treatment processes are inefficient
for removing hydrophobic NPs that effortlessly float on water due to their low density.
Nonetheless, the same study proved the high ability of column filtration to remove NPs (180 nm)
with an efficiency of 99% as due to their small size, they are likely to attach to (or to be absorbed
to) the grains. Although this method seems to work well, some NPs still pass through the filter and
can be found in water, while the removal efficiency is reported to depend on the particles’ size
(180 nm–125 μm). On top of this, the used NPs were composed of pure polymer and had a
homogenous spherical shape. In environmental conditions, the NPs may arrive to much smaller
sizes, while they are most likely characterized by shape inhomogeneity and altered surface
chemistry. As previously referred, plastic fragments in water are exposed to different degradation
processes and interactions with various components found in the environment, resulting in
increased hydrophilicity or the formation of complexes. For instance, unlike pristine NPs, those in
the environment undergo natural aging processes like UV irradiation or biological degradation.
These processes change surface chemistry, introducing oxygen-containing functional groups [50].
Furthermore, in the case of environmental samples, NPs, and other organic and inorganic
components may clog the filters and decline their efficiency for continuous water treatment [51].
Alternatively, various batch adsorption studies were conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of
removing NPs from water. Ganie et al. [52] prepared sugarcane bagasse-derived biochar powders
(BC) at different pyrolysis temperatures to assess their efficiency in adsorbing hydrophilic PSbased Latex beads (size: few hundreds of nm < 500 nm). The biochar prepared at the highest
pyrolysis temperature (750 °C) had a high surface area (540.36 m2 g-1) and enhanced pores volume.

At the same time, the performed analysis confirmed that it possessed the least negatively charged
functional groups, all characteristics that improve the electrostatic interaction with the negatively
charged NPs and their entrapment into the porous structure, reaching a maximum adsorption
capacity of 44.9 mg/g in DI water dispersions. In another work, Tiwari et al. [53] studied the
efficiency of Zn/Al LDH to adsorb hydrophilic PS NPs (55 nm). They reported that the zeta
potential of LDH (45.5 ± 0.6 mV) became negative after the interaction with NPs (-36.8 ± 2 mV).
At the same time, new absorption bands in the FTIR spectra appeared, and the surface area of the
LDHs was enhanced, all supporting these structures' successful adsorption of NPs. Under
optimized conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity reached was 164.49 mg/g in DI water.
Table 1 shows the most relevant studies on removing NPs of sizes lower than 500 nm through
adsorption processes. Although the results are promising, some restrictions still make this method
challenging. For instance, in all the recent studies, the adsorbents were in the form of particles
dispersed in the reaction media, making their recovery after the remediation process, as centrifuge,
filtration, or other separation steps should be applied for their removal. Moreover, only a few works
have studied the fate of the adsorbed NPs after collecting the adsorbents, following chemical
desorption steps, and studying the reusability. The complexity of the media where the NPs are
found is still an issue. Although some of the studies have analyzed how the adsorption performance
is affected by the presence of different components in the water medium, further studies in more
complicated environments need to be performed. In addition, in most of the presented studies, the
target NPs are made of pure PS of various sizes and with specific surface chemistry. However, it
remains to be seen whether NPs of different nature and with different surface functional groups
can show the same behavior under similar conditions.

Biological degradation is another attractive method for the remediation of plastic particles.
Focused on NPs, Vogel et al. [22] studied the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET NPs mimicking realworld aquatic conditions through the thermophilic cutinase TfCut2 from Thermobifida fusca,
demonstrating the effective cleavage of the polymer’s ester bonds. However, the enzymatic and
microbial degradation of NPs depends on the plastics' physico-chemical characteristics and on the
required genes of the microorganisms to break them down [54]. Consequently, it is necessary to
study the efficiency of biodegradation. Specific studies are needed for different types of NPs in
complex environments to evaluate the performance of enzymatic biodegradation better.

The above mentioned methods for plastic particle removal from water are often timeconsuming, complex to implement, and necessitate significant space and large amounts of
chemicals. Consequently, these factors limit their applicability [25,58]. Additionally, these methods
cannot thoroughly eliminate severe and complicated water contaminants, such as plastic debris,
allowing them to discharge into the environment from wastewater treatment plants quickly.

AOPs have emerged as alternative methods for effectively remediating plastic particles in
aqueous environment [59]. AOPs result in the in-situ generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which
undergo non-selective reactions and can degrade various organic pollutants with high-rate
constants. Depending on the type of AOPs, other reactive oxygen species can also be generated,
such as O2•-, SO4•-, 1O2, Cl•, and HO2•, which can contribute to the degradation of toxic compounds
into harmless by-products [59,60].
Fig. 2 reveals that assessing the efficiency of AOPs for the degradation of plastic particles is in
a preliminary stage, with most works targeting the degradation of MPs [61–64], while research on
NPs is still minimal but increases progressively [26,27,65–67]. According to our search, one review
paper assesses the effect of AOPs on the degradation of MPs [59]. In contrast, the published papers
on the degradation of NPs were not considered in that review. Due to the small size of NPs, the
challenges in conceiving their degradation mechanism and fate after AOPs and finding the most
suitable characterization methods of the degradation products will need to be faced in future
research works. In this section, we present the published outcomes, including experimental
conditions and applied characterization methods, to give insights for future research on using the
most promising AOPs in the degradation of NPs.

Among the chemical oxidation processes, ozonation is considered a robust AOP for the
remediation of plastic particles in contaminated water [73,74]. The reactive agent, ozone (O3), can
attack electron-rich components such as activated aromatic rings, amines, and double bonds,
resulting in ring opening and converting the complex compounds to smaller molecules. In addition,
the •OH produced during the ozonation process contributes significantly to the oxidation of toxic
water pollutants [75,76]. Notably, pioneering studies have illustrated that ozonation is a valuable
alternative for removing plastic fragments, proving that NPs break down into smaller molecules
and gradually mineralize (Table 2) [26,68]. This can be attributed to three main reasons: i) O3
introduces oxygen to the surface of NPs, enhancing the hydrophilicity and oxidative degradation;
ii) the unsaturated and saturated bonds can be attacked directly by O3 or indirectly by •OH to open
the aromatic rings and produce simple by-products [26]; iii) the produced by-products can undergo
further reactions with the available reactive oxygen radical species, and convert to nontoxic
compounds.
Li et al. [26] studied the ozonation and chlorination of PS NPs (100 nm) in pure water. In terms
of analysis methods, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) followed the molecular weight of NPs
during the reaction, while the efficiency of the degradation process was monitored by TOC
analysis. Besides, modifications of the NPs were monitored by measuring the Tg of the polymeric
particles and using SEM, FTIR, and XPS characterization methods. The generated intermediates
during the ozonation process were followed by Pyr-GC/MS analysis. The SEM images (Fig. 3 (ab)) depicted that after 240 min of ozonation, the size of the plastic particles reduced. The formation
of polar functional groups was proved by the emerging peaks in FTIR, ascribed to the stretching
vibration of carboxylic, alkyl hydroperoxide, and ketone groups, while the results of Pyr-GC/MS
revealed seven oxygen-containing intermediates. Finally, the TOC was reduced by 42.7%,

indicating the successful mineralization of the NPs following this method. However, this study
occurred in pure water and, thus, could not provide any information on the effect of other
contaminants present in the degradation of NPs, like in actual contaminated water conditions.
Alternatively, Pulido-Reyes et al. [68] carried out a study on the degradation of NPs (Pd- labeled
PS > 100 nm) in lake water via the ozonation process. In contrast to the previous work, in this
research study, no changes were observed in the morphology of NPs (Figs. 3 (c-d)) after the
ozonation process, as SEM and DLS indicated no agglomeration or fragmentation. Nonetheless,
the surface charge, evaluated by zeta potential analysis, decreased with increasing ozone dose. On
the top, through ICP-MS, it was confirmed that no Pd was released from the NPs during the
ozonation process, proving that no degradation of NPs occurred, and this was mainly attributed to
the use of high concentrations of NPs and the low reaction time.

3.1.2. Electrochemical oxidation
Electrochemical oxidation is another alternative method by which reactive oxygen species like
•

OH and H2O2 are produced. It is an eco-friendly and cost-effective method to induce the

degradation and mineralization of persistent pollutants [77,78]. Due to such advantages, this method
has also been used to degrade NPs (Table 2).
Kiendrebeogo et al. [25] used the electro-oxidation (EO) and electro-peroxidation (EO-H2O2)
methods to degrade 100 nm-sized PS NPs. Both methods selected boron-doped diamond (BDD)
as an anode, and titanium and carbon felt (CF) were the cathodes. It has been demonstrated that in
25

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r15f3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-9713 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0

the presence of Na2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte, a BDD anode can effectively oxidize sulfate
ions to persulfate (S2O82−). This, in turn, plays a crucial role in the oxidation of organic compounds
by generating sulfate radicals (SO4•-), thereby facilitating the degradation process. As a result, their
findings revealed that in both the EO and EO-H2O2 systems, hydroxyl radicals •OH and SO4•- were
generated. Furthermore, in the EO-H2O2 system, an additional generation of hydroxyl radicals •OH
and sulfate radicals SO4•- occurred, attributed to the decomposition of H2O2 and its direct
interaction with the produced persulfate ions S2O82-. Hence, at the optimal conditions, the further
generated reactive species during EO-H2O2 resulted in NPs degradation efficiency of 86.8% ±
1.8%, 2.6 times more than that obtained during the EO process. It is worth noting that the
degradation efficiency was followed by monitoring the absorption peak of the PS C=C bonds at
254 nm. Moreover, it was confirmed that under optimal conditions, a significant portion of
degraded NPs was mineralized (6.5 ± 0.64%) during the EO-H2O2 process.

3.1.3. Plasma-induced degradation processes
Electrical discharge plasma is one of the most promising AOPs, providing reactive oxidizing
agents such as potential electrons and radicals (•OH) in situ via high voltage discharge. The
generated reactive compounds can attack the chemical bonds of organic pollutants such as plastics
and decay them into small and nontoxic molecules [79,80]. Zhou et al. [7] evaluated the performance
of plasma-induced degradation of PS NPs (200 nm). According to the morphological analysis
(Figs. 4 (a-b)), NPs were melted and rough after the treatment. The size and zeta potential
variations were precisely studied using a nanoparticle potential analyzer. The findings depicted
that in a brief time (15 min) (Fig. 4 (c)), the size of all NPs was decreased to 50-150 nm. Moreover,
after the treatment, the zeta potential of NPs became more negative due to the hydroxyl and

26

carboxyl groups produced on their surface. Considering the FTIR, XPS, and fluorescence spectra
presented in Figs. 4 (d-i), aliphatic groups were also created as hydroxylated and carboxylated
byproducts.
Nonetheless, the degradation of NPs could also result in highly toxic byproducts, leading to
secondary environmental pollution. Therefore, toxicity studies of the water where NPs were
treated could offer a better insight into evaluating the performance of the NPs degradation process
from a different point of view. To this aim, Zhou et al. [7] conducted a toxicity study to confirm the
efficiency of the plasma-induced degradation process of NPs. Interestingly, in the presence of
treated NPs with a concentration of 30 mg L -1, the growth of Scenedesmus obliquus, a green algae
species, was not significantly affected by the treated NPs. Notwithstanding, the toxicity effect of
the treated NPs was substantially higher for the Human alveolar cells.

3.1.4. Photocatalytic process
Photocatalysis is a sustainable, cost-effective, widely available method and one of the most
extensively used AOPs that deal with water purification, in line with the sustainable development

28

goals posed by the United Nations 2030 agenda [81]. In parallel with the other AOPs, photocatalysis
was also applied to study the degradation of NPs (Table 2) [27–29] [69].
It is believed that when plastic is exposed to UV light, reactive radical species are produced,
leading to chain decomposition and by-product generation. In this regard, Tian et al. [69]
synthesized a 14C-radioactively labeled PS (230 nm) and studied its phototransformation in water
under UV irradiation (254 nm, 0.7 mW cm-2). They proved that the UV irradiation of the NPs
dispersed in nanopure water induced significant oxidation on the surface of the NPs as well as 17.1
% of mineralization in 48 h, while a substantial production of small-molecule oxidative products
leached in the water. These hydrophilic products underwent further degradation or mineralization
due to the UV irradiation. Nonetheless, according to the SEM images in Fig. 5 (a), the irradiation
was not strong enough to induce any morphological changes in the NPs.
Furthermore, in a study by Cai et al. [71], various oxidants like NaClO and peroxymonosulfate
(PMS) were subjected to UV irradiation to generate more reactive species such as •OH, •Cl, and
SO4•-, facilitating the efficient degradation of PS NPs. Their results showed that the UV/PMS
process exhibited superior performance. The UV/PMS system achieved 94.30% turbidity removal
and 63.90% mineralization in 360 minutes, while UV/NaClO showed 78.20% turbidity removal
and 7.00% mineralization. As depicted in Fig. 5 (b), almost no spherical particles were observed
after degradation. Surprisingly, the untreated PS NPs exhibited low toxicity, with just a 1.98%
inhibition rate on luminescent bacteria, contrary to the ones subjected to the degradation process
(98.19%). This indicates that despite the effective degradation of NPs, the resulting by-products
are more toxic. Consequently, it is essential to devise a robust degradation method that breaks
down solid NPs and efficiently mineralizes any potential by-products resulting from NP chain
cleavage.

Luca et al. [70] explored the feasibility of an alternative homogeneous photocatalytic system
based on the Fenton reaction. In the photo-Fenton process (UV/H2O2/Fe3+), H2O2 and Fe3+ undergo
reactions under UV irradiation, generating further •OH radicals. Under the optimal condition
reported in Table 2, the mineralization efficiency followed the trend: UV/H2O2/Fe3+ > UV/H2O2 >
H2O2/Fe3+ > photolysis, underscoring the significance of additional •OH production in the
degradation of NPs. The turbidity, TOC, and TEM analyses confirmed the thorough degradation
and mineralization of PS NPs after 60 min of the photo-Fenton process (UV/H2O2/Fe3+). In
addition, TEM images revealed that the size of PS NPs decreased during the degradation process.
Despite the total mineralization observed, the use of UV as the light source and the homogeneous
addition of iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate and H2O2 in the reaction media may limit the applicability
of this process for degrading water pollutants, including NPs.
Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes require a semiconductor that possesses a void energy
region between the top of the valence band (VB) and the bottom of the conduction band (CB),
called energy band gap, Eg. Generally, the semiconductor catalysts are activated through the
absorption of a photon with higher energy than the Eg to induce the promotion of an electron from
the VB to the CB, leaving behind a hole in the VB. The photogenerated electron and hole can
oxidize water to hydroxyl radicals or reduce oxygen to superoxide radicals. The produced radical
species can then oxidize the nearby organic compounds like plastic particles. Various
heterogeneous photocatalysts, including films (TiO2 [27], CuxO [28], and MOF-derived porous αFe2O3 [65]), foams (TiO2– P25/β- SiC [29,66]), TiO2/MOF(MIL-100(Fe) particles immobilized on
perlite granules [72], and SnO2/g-C3N4 [67] immobilized on the electrospun vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene, were used to degrade different NP types (such as PS, PET, and
Polymethylmethacrylate) in the 120-500 nm size range. Fig. 5 depicts the heterogeneous

photocatalytic systems like TiO2/β-SiC foams, MOF-derived Fe2O3 film, and SnO2/g-C3N4/PVDFHFP composite. Turbidity, TOC, GC-MS, FTIR, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM, NTA, and fluorescence
spectroscopy analyses were conducted in the mentioned studies to follow the PS NPs degradation
during the photocatalytic process.

In particular, under UV irradiation, TiO2-based photocatalysts, especially in the mixed
(nanotubes/nanograss) structure, resulted in 12.7% of mineralization [27]. As revealed by the FTIR
analysis of the PS NPs after the photocatalytic process, the introduction of oxygen to the structure
of NPs and generating new functional groups like carbonyl and ketone can affect the process. The
peak is attributed to the carbonyl group, and a reference peak is used to calculate the carbonyl
index (CI). For the mixed TiO2 structure under UV irradiation, the CI was increased from 0.08 to
0.27. This increase suggests introducing additional oxygen-based functional groups to the organic
polymeric chains, promoting chain scission and subsequent degradation or mineralization.
Furthermore, Allé et al. [29] proved that 7 h of UVA irradiation in the presence of TiO2– P25/βSiC foams can cause the polymethylmethacrylate NPs mineralization with an efficiency of 50%,
indicating that such components are highly promising in the NPs remediation field. Upon detailed
evaluation of the effects of various experimental parameters such as the flow rate, the initial pH,
and the UV light intensity on the NPs photodegradation efficiency, it can be concluded that the
higher the NPs residence in the reactor (low flow rate) the higher degradation efficiency was
achieved, while the higher the UV light intensity, the higher the reaction kinetic rate constant,
therefore the faster is the photodegradation process. On the other hand, the primary solution
(pH>9) showed a negative effect on the photodegradation, with the mineralization efficiency
reaching 17%, due to the repulsion force between the negatively charged surface of TiO2 and the
negatively charged carboxylate groups of the polymethylmethacrylate NPs. In addition, the same
research group conducted a methodological study [66] to explore the impact of powdery or

immobilized TiO2 on the reliability of characterization methods. They extensively discussed the
suitable analytical tools for qualitatively and quantitatively tracking the degradation of NPs with
different sizes (140, 300, and 508 nm). Their results for each reaction mode are summarized in
Table 2. Employing commercially available Aeroxide TiO2 P25 in powdery form for batch slurry
reactions and upon immobilization on β-SiC foams, they found that the presence of TiO2 particles
in the slurry hindered monitoring of degraded NPs using TOC, UV-Vis, or Py-GC/MS analyses.
Conversely, in the immobilized mode, the collected suspension after photocatalytic degradation
allowed for reliable analyses. Moreover, FE-SEM, TEM, and DLS provided indications of NPs
degradation during reactions, and the batch slurry mode yielded unreliable and non-quantitative
results. Hence, while immobilizing photocatalysts may decrease the interaction with NPs, this
remains the most effective strategy for a reliable characterization in NPs degradation studies.
Despite advances in heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of NPs, the reported systems
predominantly rely on UV light sources, which cover only a small portion of sunlight. Therefore,
further studies are needed for a sustainable transit toward effective NPs remediation without the
exclusive need for UV light. In this regard, Acuña-Bedoya et al. [28] developed a photocatalyst
active under sunlight irradiation composed of immobilized copper oxide semiconductors grown
through the anodizing process in NH4F media. They studied the degradation of PS NPs under
visible light irradiation (Table 2). The reaction process results in a CI increase from 0.70 to 59.75
after 50 hours, which, together with the GC/MS analysis, proves the formation of carbonyl groups
in the structure of NPs. Furthermore, 23.5% and 15% of NPs degradation and mineralization were
observed. Combinations between different semiconductors have been explored to improve the
performance of the photocatalysts under daylight irradiation. In particular, metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) composed of Fe(III) metal centers linked with 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic

acid were employed to boost the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 [72]. These MOFs enhanced
the absorption of simulated solar light and promoted the transfer of photoexcited electrons to the
metal clusters. The resulting final composite was immobilized onto porous perlite mineral
particles, and its ability to degrade PET NPs was assessed. Compared to pure TiO2, the composite
with MOF exhibited improved NPs degradation performance validated across multiple parameters.
Specifically, the CI increased from 0.96 to 0.99, indicating superior photocatalytic activity. This,
in combination with the decrease in the turbidity ratio of the NPs dispersion (final/initial) reaching
0.454 for TiO2/MOF, while for pure TiO2 was 0.539, highlights the superior performance of
TiO2/MOF in the degradation of NPs under solar light irradiation. However, as highlighted by the
authors, the released soluble organic compounds pose a higher toxicity risk during the degradation
process than the NPs themselves. Moreover, the developed process showed optimal performance
at a solution pH of 3, which may not accurately represent the pH levels found in natural water
samples. Alternatively, this pH deviation could compromise the stability of the photocatalysts and
potentially result in the leaching of elements from the applied MOF into the reaction medium,
thereby shifting the photocatalytic process from heterogeneous to homogeneous.
To further enhance the performance of the systems for the degradation of NPs under daylight
irradiation, a recent study focused on the combination of photocatalytic and piezocatalytic activity.
In particular, a Z-scheme piezo-photocatalyst (SnO2/g-C3N4/PVDF-HFP) was developed, capable
of using solar and water-driven energy sources to degrade PS NPs. This catalyst shows strong solar
light absorption, notable piezoelectricity, and ease of recovery. The efficacy of the piezophotocatalytic process in oxidizing and fragmenting PS NPs was demonstrated using various
characterization techniques, including SEM, NTA, XPS, FTIR, and TOC. As outlined in Table 2,
the piezo-photocatalytic experiments produced reactive species that oxidized the NPs, resulting in

their fragmentation and decreased aromaticity. Through this strategy, 46% mineralization was
achieved within 15 hours of interaction.
Overall, the reported studies represent meaningful progress in NPs degradation by leveraging
renewable energy sources, including a broad spectrum of solar light beyond just UV radiation.
However, to further enhance practical feasibility and ensure broader applicability, it is crucial to
assess and optimize the performance of these processes within the varied and challenging
conditions presented by complex environmental samples.
In addition to engineering an appropriate photocatalyst, reactors play a crucial role in
photocatalytic degradation performance. Optofluidic catalytic reactors offer advantages such as a
large specific surface area, high mass transfer, and photon utilization efficiency and have been
reported to enhance the removal efficiency of soluble water pollutants [65]. In the case of NPs, Chen
et al. [65] introduced a photoelectron-Fenton microreactor to degrade PS NPs. They synthesized a
MOF-derived porous α-Fe2O3 thin film and coated it in the reaction chamber to facilitate Fenton
reactions. Under low pH conditions, available H2O2 and leached Fe2+ from α-Fe2O3 initiated
Fenton reactions, producing •OH and Fe3+. Additionally, electrons and holes were generated
through the light absorption of α-Fe2O3. The photogenerated electrons could combine with Fe3+
to regenerate Fe2+ for further Fenton reactions, leading to the continuous production of •OH for
attacking NPs in water. Their designed photo-reactor achieved over 80% degradation, monitored
through the turbidity reduction of the PS NPs dispersion in water under 1.2 V bias and 120 mW
cm2 of simulated solar irradiation. While this is a well-performant process, no information was
provided on the mineralization of potential by-products. Furthermore, similar to other studies, the
reaction conditions do not accurately reflect the complexity of real-world environmental samples,
where various types of environmentally relevant NPs are present in complex organic matrices.

In conclusion, researchers have endeavored to enhance the sustainability, feasibility, and
performance of photo-based NP degradation processes. While acknowledging variations in
reaction conditions and analytical methods employed for assessing degraded NPs, a common trend
emerges: NPs undergo significant morphological modifications during photo-based treatments.
The SEM analyses (summarized in Fig. 6) underscore, contrary to the limited efficacy of
photolysis (Fig. 6(a)), where merely surface cracks on NPs are induced. However, in the
photocatalytic processes, a significant NP degradation with evident size reduction (Figs. 6(b-c)),
creation of cavities on the NPs surface, and fragmentation (Figs. 6 (d-e)) occurs. However, these
results indicate that more than current photo-based processes may be needed for thorough NP
degradation. The cleavage of polymeric chains could lead to the formation of smaller fragments,
potentially generating more toxic by-products and posing more significant environmental
challenges than the original NPs. To address this, comprehensive studies are needed,
encompassing the morphological and chemical analyses of NPs, the reaction media, and
toxicological assessments of the potential by-products. Such endeavors would significantly
enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of photo-based processes in the remediation of
sustainable NPs.

While various AOPs have been utilized for the degradation of NPs, these endeavors encounter
certain limitations that must be addressed for a more viable and effective NPs degradation
approach. Based on the literature review, we highlight the most evident shortcomings encountered
alongside the appropriate methods that may be considered to address these issues.
4.1. Overlooked challenges stemming from the complex environment
Most of the studies on the NPs environmental fate and their remediation approaches are
performed using monodispersed artificial nanobeads, mostly PS NPs, at high concentrations far
from the environmentally relevant ones. However, these conditions do not usually represent the
various types of NPs present in the environment and their expected concentration and, therefore,
do not reflect real-world exposure. These plastic nanostructures mainly possess few defects and
homogeneous chemical composition, substantially different from the NPs dispersed in the
environment. These have irregular shapes and complex surface chemistry due to the degradation
experienced. This raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of the obtained results [51].
Hence, for a more accurate assessment of NPs' environmental implications, it is essential to use
more environmentally relevant media or gather them directly from their natural surroundings.
Estimations on the environmental concentration of NPs indicate that it is very low (1 pg L-1 15 μg L-1 for NPs of 50nm [82]). At the same time, they may be embedded in complex organic
matrices, making their collection and quantification extremely difficult. Before being
characterized or quantified, liquid samples should be processed with various pretreatment steps to
separate the NPs from their complex organic matrices [51,83]. On the other hand, due to the deficient
environmental concentrations of the NPs, much lower than the detection limit of some
characterization techniques, pre-concentration methods such as ultrafiltration, centrifuge, cloud
point extraction, and freeze-drying should be applied before the proper characterization [84–86].

Confronted with the complexities of collecting and processing environmental samples, scientists
have sought alternative approaches to mimic environmentally relevant NPs through the mechanical
and photocatalytic degradation of larger plastic fragments. Employing various top-down
methodologies such as laser ablation [87] and ball milling [88], these efforts have resulted in the
fabrication of NPs with properties closely resembling those found in natural environments.
However, despite this achievement, such approaches have predominantly been utilized for
toxicological evaluations and have seen limited integration into NP degradation through AOPs.
Moreover, wastewater is replete with diverse organic and inorganic compounds, which can
impede the efficiency of water pollutant degradation processes [89]. NPs are solid water pollutants
characterized by their small size and high surface area. Hence, in real-world environmental
samples, NPs are rarely pristine; they often harbor various organic and inorganic components
sorbed on their surface [90]. In addition, environmental samples typically contain different NP
types. These factors pose significant constraints on the feasibility of degradation processes. While
the effects of environmental factors like pH variations, water complexity, and the presence of ions
and organic compounds on degrading water-soluble pollutants have been studied, there is still a
significant gap in understanding how these factors affect NP degradation [89,91].

4.2. Limitations in characterizing NPs after AOPs
Regrettably, there is still a lack of reliable analytical techniques that are both straightforward
and sensitive enough to detect individual plastic particles (< 1 μm) from complex mixtures of
various polymers, additives, and degradation products. This makes their analysis even more
challenging. Most of the so-far reported characterization techniques for NPs are presented in Fig.
7. Specifically, SEM, TEM, DLS, zeta potential, FTIR, and XPS are widely used techniques for

39

studying the morphology, size distribution, shape, and surface charge, as well as the chemical
composition of the degraded NPs [92]. However, such analyses can be challenging due to their low
resolution and high detection limit, which demand high NPs concentrations, but also due to the
NPs agglomeration and low particle size, limiting their applicability in some instances [33,49]. Due
to these constraints, advanced technological solutions should be adopted to study the degradation
of NPs.
Recent advancements in NP characterization, rarely considered for AOPs, could prove
invaluable for addressing such challenges in future studies. For instance, confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM) offers a non-destructive approach to analyzing the size, shape, and
distribution of NPs in complex matrices [93]. The advanced optical nanoscope (NOMON) uses a
super-resolution lens to enhance resolution and image quality, enabling detailed characterization
of NPs in water [49]. NTA provides valuable insights into size distribution, shape, and concentration
by analyzing individual particles [94]. In addition, near-edge X-ray absorption exemplary spectra
(NEXAFS) are a powerful tool that can be used to investigate the chemical and structural
properties of plastic particles that are less than 100 nm in size [95]. In contrast to FTIR, which is
more appropriate for larger particle sizes with high particle concentrations and polar functional
groups, Raman spectroscopy, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), provides
chemical fingerprint identification with exceptional sensitivity, allowing for the analysis of
nanoparticles at low concentrations [96,97]. Furthermore, for analyzing the emergence of various
intermediates during the degradation processes, Pyr-GC/MS and fluorescent spectroscopy were
employed. These methods are sensitive to impurities and possess high detection limits. Hence,
pretreatment and concentration of the NP samples are necessary [98]. However, the thermal

40

desorption-proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (TD-PTR-MS) was appropriate for the
characterization of NPs at lower concentrations and in natural environments [99].
In addition to these methods, established combined techniques can further enhance the
simultaneous morphological and chemical analysis, increasing the accuracy of results when
studying the degradation of NPs in real-world samples [14,15]. For instance, Raman spectroscopy
can be integrated with microscopy (µ-Raman spectroscopy) to identify NPs at a minimum size of
1 μm [100]. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy integrated with optical tweezers known as the Raman
tweezers (RTs) can trap and characterize plastics in the range of < 1 µm even in seawater [98,100].
Nano-FTIR and visible-near infrared dark-field hyperspectral imaging (DF-HSI) combine
microscopy with spectroscopy, allowing imaging and chemical identification of various plastic
particles with sizes less than 1000 nm [101,102]. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM)
combines the merits of X-ray microscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
spectroscopy (NEXAFS). It can be used for the chemical analysis of NPs [95]. Separation
techniques like field-flow fractionation (F3) and asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4)
enable the isolation of particles based on physical characteristics, facilitating comprehensive
analysis of particle interactions in complex environments [103].

Fig. 7. Overview of characterization methods utilized and potentially beneficial for analyzing
degraded NPs through AOPs.

In conclusion, the study of NP degradation through AOPs is still in its early stages, and it is
unsurprising if the points mentioned here cover only some of the research gaps in this field.
Moreover, current AOPs often need complete NP elimination and mineralization, necessitating
chemical additives, UV light sources, and extended reaction times. Hence, they may inadvertently
lead to secondary water pollution and increased energy consumption. Furthermore, given that NPs
act as insoluble water contaminants, developing efficient reactors and highly effective
immobilized heterogeneous catalytic systems is imperative. Optimization of these systems is
essential for maximizing NP-catalyst interactions while minimizing energy and chemical usage
during catalyst recovery [65,66]. Bridging these knowledge gaps is crucial for devising more
effective and sustainable strategies to mitigate NP contamination in water systems.

5. Conclusion
NPs from primary and secondary sources find their way to enter the water bodies. The detected
NPs in drinking water, even of low concentration, led to concerns about their potential hazards.
Although various conventional methods were applied for the degradation of NPs from water, their
complexity and inadequacy in the total degradation and mineralization limit their wide application.
AOPs are the alternative methods that can produce reactive radical species to degrade NPs to small
and harmless compounds. Considering the efficiency of these methods, several heterogeneous and
homogenous AOPs were applied to the degradation of plastic micro and nanofragments. As
reported, ozonation, electro-oxidation, electro-peroxidation, plasma-induced, and photocatalytic
processes showed an effective performance for the degradation of NPs. Nonetheless, considering
the slow publication rate in applying AOPs for the in situ degradation of NPs, this emerging field
remains in its infancy, necessitating more significant effort to explore robust AOPs with improved
efficiency and minimal environmental impact.
Moreover, existing research primarily involves artificial NPs and controlled environmental
conditions, highlighting the crucial need for investigations using environmentally realistic NP
samples under potentially posing conditions. This review reveals that sample preparation for
various characterization techniques needs to be more specific, underscoring the importance of
providing precise experimental and analytical details. Coordinated efforts are therefore essential
to enhance experimental protocols and address remaining challenges. This collective endeavor will
foster a deeper understanding of NP degradation via AOPs, paving the way for sustainable and
effective NP remediation, even on an industrial scale.
