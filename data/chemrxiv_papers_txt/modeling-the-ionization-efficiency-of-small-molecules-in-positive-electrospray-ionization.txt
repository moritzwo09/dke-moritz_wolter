ABSTRACT
Technological advancements in liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionizaKon (ESI) high

25

resoluKon mass spectrometry (HRMS) have made it an increasingly popular analyKcal technique in non-

26

targeted analysis (NTA) of environmental and biological samples. One criKcal limitaKon of current

27

methods in NTA is the lack of available analyKcal standards for many of the compounds detected in

28

biological and environmental samples. ComputaKonal approaches can provide esKmates of

29

concentraKons by modeling the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency of a compound expressed as the relaKve response

30

factor (RRF). In this paper, we explore the applicaKon of molecular dynamics (MD) in the development

31

of a computaKonal workÔ¨Çow for predicKng RRF. We obtained measurements of RRF for 48 compounds

32

with LC - quadrupole Kme-of-Ô¨Çight (QTOF) MS and calculated their RRF by dividing the observed peak

33

areas by their concentraKons. We used the CGenFF force Ô¨Åeld to generate the topologies and

34

GROMACS to conduct the (MD) simulaKons (t = 1 ns). We calculated the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb

35

interacKons between the analytes and all other molecules in the ESI droplet, which were then used to

36

construct a mulKlinear regression model for predicKng RRF. The best performing model showed a

37

coeÔ¨Écient of determinaKon (R2) of 0.82 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.13 log units. This

38

performance is comparable to other predicKve models including machine learning models. While there

39

is a need for further evaluaKon of diverse chemical structures, our approach showed promise in

40

predicKons of RRF.

INTRODUCTION

47

Recent technological breakthroughs in high-resoluKon mass spectrometry (HRMS) have made it an

48

increasingly popular technology in environmental analysis1, biomonitoring2,3 and metabolomics4. Ohen

49

combined with suspect screening (SS) and non-targeted analysis (NTA) workÔ¨Çows, HRMS has shown

50

great promise in the discovery of lesser-known chemical structures and in comprehensively

51

characterizing the chemical composiKon of complex mixtures.2,3,5 One criKcal challenge associated with

52

the applicaKon of HRMS in SS or NTA is the limited availability of analyKcal standards for many

53

anthropogenic / syntheKc chemicals and many endogenously produced metabolites.6,7

54

When it comes to endogenous metabolites, the lack of commercially available analyKcal standards is

55

ohen due to certain compounds being less well-characterized and thus not yet synthesized or puriÔ¨Åed.

56

For anthropogenic chemicals, one of the reasons is that chemical manufacturers in the U.S. are not

57

required to produce analyKcal standards for the chemicals that they manufacture and release to the

58

environment.7 One excepKon to this rule is pesKcides.7 It is important to note at this stage that the

59

requirement for analyKcal standards does not extend to the transformaKon and breakdown products of

60

these chemicals. So even in a hypotheKcal scenario where manufacturers would be required to

61

produce analyKcal standards, that would cover only the parent compounds and not all the

62

transformaKon products. The U.S. Environmental ProtecKon Agency (EPA) has prioriKzed about 1.2

63

million chemicals of environmental importance and has created a database called EPA‚Äôs CompTox

64

Chemicals Dashboard (henceforth referred to as ‚Äúthe dashboard‚Äù).8 Nu√±ez et al.6 esKmated that out of

65

the 1.2 million chemicals on EPA‚Äôs Dashboard, less than 2% are available as analyKcal standards.

66

There is thus a need to develop computaKonal approaches to conÔ¨Årm and quanKfy detected

67

compounds without analyKcal standards.6,9,10 While detecKon and tentaKve conÔ¨ÅrmaKon can be

68

achieved with MS/MS libraries, quanKÔ¨ÅcaKon remains a more challenging task.11,12 Liquid

Chromatography (LC) ‚Äì Electrospray IonizaKon (ESI) HRMS is one of the most commonly used HRMS

70

techniques in SS and NTA studies. One criKcal challenge in ESI is that abundances expressed as peak

71

areas or peak heights are not easily translatable to concentraKons. Two compounds of the same

72

concentraKon can exhibit peak areas that diÔ¨Äer by 3 orders of magnitude because of diÔ¨Äerences in

73

ionizaKon12,13. Abundances may be used as surrogate for concentraKons in certain situaKons when

74

comparing the same chemical across diÔ¨Äerent samples, however, they cannot be used to compare two

75

chemicals to each other.14

76

While ESI is extensively used in mass spectrometry for the analysis of both small (e.g., metabolites

77

and large molecules (e.g., proteins), the precise mechanism has not been fully understood. BrieÔ¨Çy,

78

during ESI, the soluKon containing the analyte passes through a metal capillary that is charged at an

79

electric potenKal of thousands of Volts (kV). The soluKon forms a Kp at the end of the capillary known

80

as a Taylor cone that emits a spray of Ô¨Åne droplets. The droplets start in the Œºm range and shrink in size

81

as they undergo evaporaKon ohen accelerated with heaKng of the capillary. The density of the charged

82

ions in the droplet is controlled by repulsive Coulombic forces between posiKvely charged ions. The

83

upper limit of that density is described as the Rayleigh stability limit:

84

"#

ùëß! = $ .ùúÄ% ùõæ ùëÖ&

(eq. 1)

85

where, ùëí is the number of elementary charged parKcles, ùúÄ% is the vacuum permisvity, ùõæ is the surface

86

tension of the droplet and ùëÖ is the droplet radius.

87

Conceptual models have been proposed to describe the process that molecules undergo to become

88

ionized and transferred to the gas phase during ESI. We focus our discussion on the commonly used

89

posiKve ESI under which posiKve ions are formed. Small molecules (< 1000 Da) are thought to ionize

90

and be transferred to the gas phase by the ion evaporaKon model (IEM). According to IEM, the analyte

91

is protonated already while inside the droplet and eventually moves from the center towards the

92

surface of the droplet. As the posiKvely charged analyte meets the posiKvely charged solvent molecules

93

on the surface of the droplet, the ion is transferred to the gas phase through repulsive forces of

94

posiKvely charged ions and by the excess droplet charge.

95

Larger molecules such as globular proteins (naKvely folded proteins) are thought to ionize and be

96

transferred to the gas phase by the Charged Residue Model (CRM). According to CRM, solvent droplets

97

containing a single protein molecule gradually evaporate to dryness and as the solvent molecules

98

evaporate, the charge is transferred to the analyte. The droplets remain close the Rayleigh stability limit

99

while evaporaKng, which indicates that the droplet loses some of the electric charge as it shrinks in

100

size. This is supported by experimental observaKons where the size of solvent droplets posiKvely

101

correlated with the droplet charge following an exponenKal curve. Contrary to small molecules, the

102

ejecKon of globular proteins is not kineKcally favorable. The repulsive forces of the excess surface

103

charge are not suÔ¨Éciently strong for the molecule to be ejected and transferred to the gas phase. CRM

104

is supported by experimental evidence where ionizaKon of globular proteins produces ions with a

105

charge of [ùëÄ + ùëß! ùêª]'! ( , where ùëß! is the charge at the Rayleigh limit of water droplets of the same size

106

as the globular protein.

107

While these two models are considered disKnct, both of these two processes could apply to small or

108

medium size molecules, especially in the case of heated ESI where the evaporaKon of the water

109

droplets is assisted through heaKng of the capillary. This is also supported by molecular dynamics (MD)

110

simulaKons studies where naKve (unmodiÔ¨Åed) carbohydrates ionize through CRM, while their

111

permethylated derivaKves ionize through IEM.15

IonizaKon eÔ¨Éciency is a property that has proven to be diÔ¨Écult to predict from a small number of

119

chemical descriptors or physicochemical properKes. Numerous invesKgaKons have examined the

120

correlaKon between ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciencies and diverse physicochemical properKes, including but not

121

limited to their pKa, logP, surface area, charge delocalizaKon, and gas-phase proton aÔ¨Énity.16‚Äì21 These

122

Ô¨Åndings have led to the development of various predicKve models for ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciencies19,22‚Äì25,

123

uKlizing both the physicochemical properKes of analytes and solvent characterisKcs as fundamental

124

inputs. These models commonly rely on parameters associated with the analyte's hydrophobicity (e.g.,

125

logP, WAPS, WANS, C/H raKo) and ionizability (such as pKa and the degree of ionizaKon)26. Data-driven

126

approaches involving machine learning, such as random forest models, have shown great promise in

providing predicKons with reasonable uncertainKes.11,12,27‚Äì29 It should be noted, however, that these

128

approaches require large datasets in the order of 100s of chemicals with diverse structures and

129

properKes and the predicKons are Ked to a speciÔ¨Åc method and instrumentaKon.

130

Theory-driven approaches that are based on quantum chemistry and computaKonal chemistry

131

principles could provide an alternaKve when large datasets are not available or are diÔ¨Écult to obtain.

132

Molecular dynamic simulaKons (MD) have been previously applied in a limited number of studies to

133

understand the mechanism of ionizaKon in salt ions, pepKdes and proteins.30‚Äì34 However, to the best of

134

our knowledge, there appears to be liwle on the study of small molecules and especially in predicKons

135

of their ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency using MD simulaKons. Our study aims to Ô¨Åll this gap by employing

136

molecular dynamics to model the behavior of chemicals in the ionizaKon chamber and evaluate the

137

potenKal of such theory-driven approaches to make predicKons and assess their uncertainKes.

Chemicals and soluKons

The analytes were provided by the US EPA for the purposes of this study and were developed as part

160

of EPA‚Äôs Non-Targeted Analysis CollaboraKve Trial (ENTACT). The preparaKon of the chemical mixtures is

161

described in detail in the study of Ulrich et al.35 For the purposes of this study, we used mixtures 504,

162

506 and 508. The mixtures were diluted in a series of diluKons Ô¨Årst with methanol (99.9% Millipore

163

Sigma) and then with HPLC water (99.9% Millipore Sigma) from 20 mM to 100, 50 and 25 ŒºM with a

164

Ô¨Ånal water content of > 99%. For the purposes of this study, we selected chemicals that ionize in

165

posiKve electrospray ionizaKon mode (ESI+) and whose calibraKon curves showed an R2 of 0.8 or

166

higher. The chemical structures and chemical idenKÔ¨Åers of the chemicals involved in the study (n=48)

167

are shown in Supplemental Spreadsheet 1. The complete chemical lists from mixtures 504, 506 and 508

168

are also shown in Supplemental Spreadsheet 1. We should note at this point that characterizing the

169

mixtures and maximizing the number of detected and idenKÔ¨Åed compounds is beyond the scope of the

170

study. As our study requires extensive computaKons that take days to complete, we have to limit our

171

eÔ¨Äorts to a small subset of compounds that saKsÔ¨Åes the criteria of detecKon (< 5 ppm mass diÔ¨Äerence

Instrumental analysis

The mixtures were analyzed with an Agilent 1290 ultra-high performance liquid chromatography

(UPLC) coupled to an Agilent quadrupole Kme-of-Ô¨Çight (QTOF) mass spectrometer. The UPLC was

177

equipped with an Agilent Ecliplse Plus C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.8 ŒºM) for the chromatographic

183

shown in Figure S1. All mixtures were injected twice at an injecKon volume of 5 ŒºL. Two no-injecKon

184

blanks and one HPLC water blank were also analyzed in the beginning of the sequence.

185

The instrument was operated in both posiKve electrospray ionizaKon mode (ESI+) and full scan mass

186

spectra (MS1) were acquired in the range of 100-1000 Da with a resolving power of 40,000 and a mass

187

accuracy of <5 ppm. The instrument was calibrated before the analysis and the mass diÔ¨Äerence was

188

corrected with reference standards using masses 121.050873 and 922.009798 for posiKve ionizaKon

189

mode.

Data collecKon and Ô¨Åle processing

192

All the collected data Ô¨Åles were processed with MS-DIAL, an open-source sohware for mass

193

spectrometry that was developed by the University of California, Davis and by RIKEN (Japan). The

194

detected features were aligned across samples and were matched to the monoisotopic masses of the

195

chemicals contained in the mixtures within a 10-ppm mass diÔ¨Äerence (Supplementary Spreadsheet).

196

The peak areas of the analytes were calculated by taking the average of the duplicate injecKons and

197

they were corrected by subtracKng the average area measured in the blanks. The MS-DIAL sesngs and

198

parameters used to process the data Ô¨Åles are presented in Supplementary Spreadsheet.

IonizaKon eÔ¨Éciency describes the extent to which molecules of an analyte in the liquid phase can

transiKon to the gas phase as ions during the process of electrospray ionizaKon. The ionizaKon

211

We generated mol2 format Ô¨Åles for all chemicals in the dataset using UCSF Chimera and using SMILES

213

diagrams for each chemical using Chemaxon and Chemicalize36 and idenKfying the dominant species at

214

the pH that would be relevant from our experiments (pH=5).37 All the pKa diagrams and the

System preparaKon

227

All preparaKon steps were conducted using GROMACS (version 2023.2). GROMACS uses periodic

228

boundary condiKons (PBC) where the atoms of the simulaKon system are put into a space-Ô¨Ålling box,

229

which is surrounded by translated copies of itself. Thus, the system does not have Ô¨Ånite borders during

230

the simulaKon, but it allows for the removal of PBC for post-simulaKon calculaKons.39 Two diÔ¨Äerent

231

systems were considered for the MD simulaKons. System 1 aimed at approximaKng the composiKon of

232

a nm electrospray droplet which included the analyte, the H+ and OH- ions produced during hydrolysis,

233

and the water and methanol molecules as shown in the Ô¨Årst step of IEM in Figure 1. With the second

234

system (System 2), we aimed to approximate the composiKon of the droplet surface and the analyte

235

located at the surface before evaporaKon as shown in the second step of IEM in Figure 1. One criKcal

236

challenge when describing both systems is describing the H+ ions in soluKon. In water, the H+ ions, also

237

(
referred to as H(*+)
, produced from the hydrolysis of water molecules react with other water molecules

238

to form hydronium, H& O(
(*+) , also known as oxonium, following the reacKons below:

247

System 1
The molecule of hydronium was described using a TIP3P that included an addiKonal hydrogen (3 H in

248

total) and was modiÔ¨Åed to include the speciÔ¨Åc parameters for H3O+ from the study of Wolf and

249

Groenhof.40 The distance between O and H (rOH) was set at 1.02√Ö, the angle for H-O-H (Œ∏HOH) was set at

250

112o, and the charges for O (qO) and H (qH) were set at -0.59 and 0.53e. The droplet was represented by

251

a three-dimensional cube and the size was set at 64 nm3 (4 x 4 x 4 nm). The number of H3O+ molecules

252

was approximated based the experimental observaKons of Smith et al.41 who determined the charge

253

(e) of water and methanol droplets in ESI+ as a funcKon of the droplet diameter. The calculaKons are

254

described in detail in Text S1 in SI.

255

The numbers of water (TIP3P) and methanol molecules were determined based on the gradient

256

mixing (Figure S1) of the two solvents during LC and based on the retenKon Kme of each chemical

257

(Supplemental Spreadsheet). This means that for every chemical the number of water and methanol

258

molecules was diÔ¨Äerent depending on when it was eluted from the LC column. Previous MD studies42

259

on ESI droplets have also suggested that the amount of methanol in the droplet plays a criKcal role in

260

the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency of the analytes. As the volume of methanol increases, the evaporaKve rate

261

increases, as does the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency, for many molecules.42

262
263
264

System 2
As menKoned earlier, System 2 aimed at approximaKng the behavior of the analyte on the surface of

265

the droplet where most of the charged ions are expected to be located. While, the presence of

266

hydronium is well established, we are confronted with the paradox that the most common ions formed

267

in posiKve electrospray ionizaKon are not [M+H3O]+, but rather [M+H]+. This indicates that either H+

268

ions also exist in the form of H+ alongside H3O+ ions on the surface of the droplet or during the Ô¨Ånal

interacKons of M and H3O+ one of the protons disengages from the H2O molecule and forms the [M+H]+

270

ion. In order to account for this discrepancy, in System 2, we describe the H+ ions as freely Ô¨ÇoaKng ions

271

that are not covalently bound to water molecules. In this case, H+ was described in the same way as

272

other ions like Na+ and Cl- are described in GROMACS using the CGenFF force Ô¨Åeld. In this descripKon,

273

the mass of H+ was set at 1.0080 g/mol and the charge (q) was set at +1. Since this is a single atom, the

274

total charge (qtot) was also set at +1. As a point of reference, Na+ ions in CGenFF are described as single

275

atoms with a mass of 22.98977 g/mol, charge of +1 and a total charge of +1. A 4 x 4 x 4 nm solvent box

was created with approximately 600 water molecules (TIP3P) and 600 H+ ions. The number of 600 H+

277

was determined based on pilot simulaKons so that H+ would remain evenly distributed inside the box

278

throughout the simulaKon to ensure conKnuous interacKons with the analyte. A smaller number of

279

ions resulted in the ions starKng evenly distributed but during the simulaKon moving to the outer parts

280

of the box and not suÔ¨Éciently interacKng with the chemical which ohen remained towards the center

281

of the box (Figure S3-5 and Text S2).

SimulaKon setup

284

The simulaKons were conducted using GROMACS version 2023.2. The simulaKon protocol started

285

with a steepest descend minimizaKon with 50,000 steps as the maximum number of minimizaKon steps

286

to perform and <1000 kJ/mol/nm as the threshold at which the minimizaKon process can stop. The

287

minimizaKon and subsequent simulaKon steps were run using Verlet as the cut-oÔ¨Ä scheme for neighbor

288

searching and Fast Smooth ParKcle-Mesh Ewald electrostaKcs (FSPME or PME in GROMACS) for

289

modeling the electrostaKc interacKons. The short-range electrostaKc cut-oÔ¨Ä points for Coulomb and

290

van der Waals interacKons were set to 1.2 nm which is recommended for CGenFF.43 The temperature

291

was set at 300 K and it was controlled with a Berendsen thermostat in NVT and a Parrinelo-Rahman

barostat in NPT. System equilibraKon was conducted in two stages, the NVT stage where volume and

293

temperature were kept constant and the NPT stage where pressure and temperature were kept

294

constant. The simulaKon step was set at 0.5 fs using a leapfrog integrator and the simulaKon length was

295

200 ps. The producKon step following equilibraKon was conducted using the same simulaKon step and

296

integrator as previously but in this case the simulaKon length was 1000 ps (1 ns). All the mdp Ô¨Åles for

CalculaKon of interacKons and model development

301

For both System 1 and System 2, we calculated the short-range Lennard-Jones and short-range

302

Coulomb interacKons between the analyte and each group of molecules in the system. For System 1,

303

the sets were i) analyte and water, ii) analyte and methanol, and iii) analyte and H3O+ ions. For System

304

2, the sets were i) analyte and water and ii) analyte and H+ ions, however, we only considered the set of

305

analyte and H+ ions since the interacKons with water were already described in System 1. As these are

306

short-range interacKons, it is important to point out that this includes only the molecules around the

307

analyte that are within the short-range distance, which was set at 1.2 nm. The interacKons were

308

calculated using the gmx energy command in GROMACS. The generated Ô¨Åles contained the interacKon

309

energies (kJ/mol) over Kme (ps) in the form of a Kme series. An example of the Coulomb and Lennard-

310

Jones interacKons for caÔ¨Äeine is shown in Figure 3. The top Ô¨Ågures show the interacKons over Kme and

311

the bowom Ô¨Ågures show the distribuKon of the observed interacKon energies using the kernel density

Our model is based on the idea that the RRF of a given compound in ESI+ can be described as a

321

funcKon of the Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interacKons between the compound and all other

322

molecules in the soluKon. RRF was expressed as a funcKon of the Coulomb and Lennard-Jones using a

mulKlinear regression model.

One criKcal challenge when incorporaKng these interacKons into a model is Ô¨Ånding which metrics are

332

meaningful for the purposes of the model. We applied a Monte Carlo simulaKon approach to randomly

333

sample the Coulomb and Lennard-Jones distribuKons (3 percenKle points per distribuKon plus the

334

standard deviaKon) 100 Kmes for each set of molecules (i.e., System 1: i. analyte and water, ii. analyte

335

and methanol, and iii. analyte and H3O+ ions; System 2: analyte and H+ ions) and selected the best

336

The coeÔ¨Écients and the intercept of the model were determined through a least-squares

348

available on GitHub ( hwps://github.com/dimitriabrahamsson/electro-spray ). The model was evaluated

349

by examining the R2, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the p-values of the coeÔ¨Écients. Aher selecKng

350

the best performing model for each set of molecules from both systems, we built a composite model

351

with the parameters whose p-values were lower than 0.1. We purposely chose a higher cutoÔ¨Ä point at

352

this stage in order to be more inclusive, however, in the Ô¨Ånal model, only the p-values below 0.05 were

353

considered signiÔ¨Åcant. The Ô¨Ånal model was evaluated based on its R2, the mean absolute error (MAE)

354

and the p-values of the coeÔ¨Écients. We also tested whether the addiKon of other physicochemical

355

properKes, i.e. vapor pressure (PV), water solubility (SW), the equilibrium parKKoning raKo between

356

octanol and water (KOW), air and water (KAW), methanol and water (KMW), methanol and air (KMA), and

357

the innate charge of the molecule improved the predicKve accuracy of the model. PV and SW were

358

calculated with OPERA 2.6 44 available on the dashboard8. KOW, KAW, KMW and KMA were calculated with

359

UFZ-LSER.45 The innate charge of the molecule was determined by examining the structure and its

360

protonaKon state at pH 5 and noKng 0 if it was neutral, +1 (or more) if it had a posiKve innate charge,

361

and -1 (or less) if it had a negaKve innate charge. Only the parameters whose coeÔ¨Écient showed a p-

362

value of less than 0.05 were considered signiÔ¨Åcant and were included in the model. A parameter with a

363

mere increase in R2 without a signiÔ¨Åcant p-value would not be included in the model.

364

The predicKve power of the model was further evaluated with a 10-fold cross validaKon and a y-

365

randomizaKon. During the 10-fold cross-validaKon, the dataset was Ô¨Årst divided into 10 equally sized

366

sub-datasets. Then, during each fold one dataset was set as the tesKng set and the remaining sub-

367

datasets were compiled into a training set. The model was trained on the training set and tested on the

368

tesKng set. The process was repeated 10 Kmes (10-fold). It is important to note at this point that when

369

applying a k-fold cross validaKon and when dividing the dataset into training and tesKng there is always

370

a possibility of encountering compounds in the tesKng set that are outside the applicability domain of

371

the trained model. In order to account for this discrepancy, if a predicKon was 2 log units higher than

372

the highest value in the dataset or 2 log units lower than the lowest value in the dataset it was

373

considered outside the applicability domain and it was excluded from the evaluaKon. The compounds

374

that were excluded from any parKcular fold of the cross-validaKon exercise were sKll included in the

375

discussion secKon of the paper. The purpose of the k-fold cross validaKon is to evaluate the predicKve

376

power of the model outside its training set and to idenKfy outlier compounds in the dataset. These

377

compounds are considered outliers in the sense that they represent physicochemical properKes that

378

are dissimilar to the ones in the training set and in order for the model to make accurate predicKons,

379

they have to be included in the training set.

380

For the y-randomizaKon, the y variable, in this case the RRF was randomly shuÔ¨Ñed, and the model

381

was developed as previously by dividing the dataset into training and tesKng sets. The process was

382

repeated 5 Kmes, and the predicKons were averaged across the 5 iteraKons. The purpose of the y-

383

randomizaKon is to evaluate the extent to which the model predicKons are diÔ¨Äerent from random

384

predicKons. This helps to determine whether the model is making meaningful predicKons and whether

385

it has been overparametrized. The lower the R2 of the y-randomizaKon and the more diÔ¨Äerent it is from

386

the R2 of the cross-validaKon, the higher the likelihood that the model is making meaningful predicKons

387

that are disKnct from random predicKons.

388

One of the challenges we encountered is that the generated CGenFF topologies ohen included high

389

penalKes (> 50) for a charge, a bond, an angle, a dihedral or an improper group. While high penalKes

390

do not necessarily mean large errors, they do denote a low similarity with the build-by-analogy

391

structure in CGenFF and it is recommended to apply cauKon when using such structures because they

392

may require further validaKon. This may be an important issue in the case of protein dynamics and

393

ligand binding, however, in our case, it is unclear how these penalKes or uncertainKes may inÔ¨Çuence

394

our calculaKons. To address this issue, we tested the robustness of the model by incrementally

395

removing compounds with high penalKes starKng from the ones with the highest penalKes to the ones

396

with the lowest penalKes. This resulted in 10 diÔ¨Äerent models with a diÔ¨Äerent cutoÔ¨Ä point as the

397

maximum acceptable penalty ranging from 500 to 50. We then examined the changes in the R2 of the

398

model as the number and type of chemicals in the dataset changed. In order to avoid introducing errors

399

in the Ô¨Årst steps of the model development, we developed the Ô¨Årst iteraKon of the model with

400

chemicals that had a penalty less than 300.

401
402

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

403

Experimental measurements

404

The observed log RRF values for the chemicals in our dataset ranged from 1.73 to 3.17 with

405

Cinchophen showing the lowest value and Thiabendazole showing the highest value (Supplementary

406

Spreadsheet). As RRF is the raKo of abundance to concentraKon, higher RRF values indicate higher

407

ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency (higher abundance at lower concentraKons). This observaKon is in agreement with

408

data from our previous study12 where Cinchophen showed a lower RRF compared to Thiabendazole. It

409

should be noted that the two studies use the same mixtures (in part) but diÔ¨Äerent methods and

410

diÔ¨Äerent instruments (same type ‚Äì Agilent LC-QTOF-MS ‚Äì but diÔ¨Äerent instrument). Despite the

411

diÔ¨Äerences in methods and instrumentaKon, the diÔ¨Äerences in the RRF values of the two chemicals are

412

preserved. This observaKon is supporKve of the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency (IE) scale approach developed by

413

Oss et al.22 where a set of RRF values can be represented as a scale of relaKve ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciencies

414

and that that scale should in principle be transferable across diÔ¨Äerent methods.

Model development

417

From the models developed for System 1, the best performing models for predicKng log RRF showed

418

an R2 of 0.42 when using the analyte-water interacKons, 0.37 when using the analyte-methanol
20

419

interacKons and 0.39 when using the analyte-H3O+ interacKons (Supplemental Spreadsheet). From the

420

models developed for System 2, the best performing model for predicKng log RRF showed an R2 of 0.71

421

(Supplemental Spreadsheet). This observaKon indicates that the Ô¨Ånal stage of ionizaKon [M+H]+ is

422

bewer predicted by the interacKons of the analyte with the H+ ions on the surface of the droplet (Figure

423

1 ‚Äì step 2 of IEM) than by the interacKons of the analyte with the other molecules while in the center

424

of the droplet (Figure 1 ‚Äì step 1 of IEM). This is not to say that there is no predicKve value in the

425

interacKons of the analyte with the solvent molecules. Previous studies have demonstrated the impacts

426

of diÔ¨Äerent solvents on the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency of small molecules46,47 and this is in agreement with

427

our calculaKons from System 1. This observaKon just indicates that the interacKons of the analyte on

428

the droplet are potenKally more determining of the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency of the analyte. The Ô¨Ånal

429

composite model consisted of the following parameters. System 1: p2, p3 and the standard deviaKon

430

for Lennard-Jones interacKons between the analyte and water; System 2: p1, p2, p3 and the standard

431

deviaKons for Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interacKons between the analyte and H+ ions. All

432

coeÔ¨Écients for the abovemenKoned parameters showed p-values below 0.05 (Table S1). Out of all the

433

physicochemical properKes that we tested, the only one that showed a staKsKcally signiÔ¨Åcant

434

contribuKon was the water solubility of the analyte (SW). The Ô¨Ånal model showed an R2 of 0.82 and an

435

MAE of 0.13.

The p-values of the coeÔ¨Écients and the intercept were all below 0.05 (Table S1). The R2 and MAE of

459

the model were comparable to those in the study of Oss et al.22 where they observed an R2 of 0.67 and

460

a standard residual error of 0.86 log units. While the two studies are very diÔ¨Äerent in the

461

computaKonal approaches, they both share datasets of similar size (48 vs 62) and they both use

462

mulKlinear regression models as their Ô¨Ånal predicKve models and thus allowing for meaningful

463

comparisons.

464

We examined whether the diÔ¨Äerences between the experimental and modeled RRF (absolute errors)

465

could be explained due to the diÔ¨Äerent retenKon Kmes (RT) of the chemicals and by extension due to

466

the diÔ¨Äerent raKos of water to methanol, but we did not observe a signiÔ¨Åcant associaKon between the

467

two. Neither did we observe a signiÔ¨Åcant associaKon between RRF and RT (Figure S6).

468

Our modeling calculaKons showed that the interacKons of the analyte with the water molecules in

469

System 1 were similar but slightly more predicKve than the interacKons of the analyte with the H3O+

470

ions (R2: 0.42 vs 0.39). Given the great collinearity of these two variables, including both of them in the

471

model renders the coeÔ¨Écients for H3O+ insigniÔ¨Åcant (p > 0.05). This observaKon suggests that, at least

472

in terms of interacKons with the analyte, the H atoms in the H2O molecules are not disKnguishable

473

from the H atoms in the H3O+ ions.

474

As menKoned earlier in the methods, we examined the eÔ¨Äect that compounds with high penalKes

475

may have on the predicKve power of the model. Including all compounds with penalKes over 300

476

resulted in a small decrease in R2 (0.82 vs 0.74) and a small increase in the MAE (0.13 vs 0.15) of the

477

model (Figure 4). Aher incrementally removing compounds with high penalKes from the dataset, we

478

observed that the R2 of the model appeared to be consistent with an increase around cutoÔ¨Ä points of

479

250 and 300 (Figure S7), which conÔ¨Årmed our iniKal cut-oÔ¨Ä point of 300. We should note at this point

480

that while in this parKcular case the eÔ¨Äect of including compounds with high penalKes appears to be

481

minimal, we do not know how that may manifest in other datasets with diÔ¨Äerent composiKon and with

482

compounds with higher penalKes.

496

The 10-fold cross validaKon showed an R2 of 0.52 and an MAE of 0.25 for compounds that were not

497

included in the training set (Figure S8A). This shows that the model can make reasonable predicKons

498

for chemicals that were not included in the training set. Two chemicals showed to be outside of the

499

applicability domain of the model (based on the deÔ¨ÅniKon in the methods secKon). These two

500

chemicals were Furalaxyl and Dicrotophos (Figure S9). During the cross-validaKon Furalaxyl showed an

501

absolute error of 10.1 log units and Dicrotophos an absolute error of 5.58 log units. Both chemicals had

502

penalKes lower than 300 so it does not seem that their penalKes would be a likely explanaKon

503

(Supplemental Spreadsheet). Most likely is that these two chemicals are structurally and

504

physicochemically disKnct from the other chemicals in the dataset. This is supported by the observaKon

505

that when these two compounds are included in the dataset their absolute errors are 0.001 log units

506

for Furalaxyl and 0.03 log units for Dicrotophos (Figure S10).

507

The y-randomizaKon showed that when the model is trained on random data the expected R2 is 0.03

508

(Figure S8B). This is substanKally lower than both the R2 of the model with all the chemicals (0.74) and

509

the R2 of the 10-fold cross-validaKon (0.52). This observaKon suggests that the model is making

510

meaningful predicKons that are disKnct from random predicKons.

511

In trying to understand the contribuKons of the diÔ¨Äerent interacKons to RRF we examined the

512

diÔ¨Äerent terms of equaKon 9 for two chemicals that showed near 0 diÔ¨Äerences between experimental

513

and predicted values of RRF. The two chemicals were 1) Cinchophen with a log RRF of 1.73, and 2)

514

Loratadine with a log RRF of 3.15. Both chemicals‚Äô log RRF is determined to a larger extent by the

515

Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interacKons and to a smaller extent by their water solubility. For both

516

chemicals, the Lennard-Jones interacKons appear to have a posiKve contribuKon to RRF while the

517

Coulomb interacKons appear to have a negaKve contribuKon (Figure 5). This is consistent for all

518

chemicals in the dataset. When comparing Cinchophen and Loratadine, it appears that the lower RRF of

519

Cinchophen is due to smaller l LJ and c Coul terms (Figure 5). The Lennard-Jones potenKal approximates

520

the van der Waals interacKons and the Coulomb potenKal represents the ability to engage in hydrogen

521

bonding. Previous studies have suggested that increased non-polar character, which would be

522

represented by the Lennard-Jones potenKal are associated with higher RRF, while increased polar

523

character which would be represented by the Coulomb potenKal is associated with a decrease in

524

RRF.22,23,27,48,49 Our observaKons appear to be in agreement with the Ô¨Åndings from previous studies.

525

Water solubility appears to play a small (Figure 5) yet signiÔ¨Åcant role (Tables S1 and S2) in the model.

526

For all compounds in the dataset, the s SW term has a posiKve contribuKon to RRF. Based on this

527

observaKon, one would expect that compounds with higher water solubility would have a higher RRF.

528

However, given that the term s SW is several orders of magnitude smaller than the l LJ and c Coul terms,

529

the inÔ¨Çuence of s SW on RRF is minimal in comparison. In our developed model, s SW acts as a correcKve

530

factor rather than a determining factor. Furthermore, water solubility is known to decrease with

531

increasing molecular weight50, which is also what we observed in our dataset. The contribuKon of the s

532

SW for Cinchophen is slightly larger than that of Loratadine which is in agreement with their molecular

533

weights (Cinchophen: 249.26 g/mol, Loratadine: 382.89 g/mol).

LimitaKons and future consideraKons
One limitaKon that needs to be acknowledged is that while our model showed good accuracy (R2:

542

0.82) the computaKonal cost of our approach is much higher than other approaches that rely on

543

simpler descriptor generators like PaDEL51 or Mordred52 . Running one simulaKon on one system for

544

one chemical takes approximately 13 min using a ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 TI 11GB Turbo GPU.

545

ConducKng simulaKons for 48 chemicals, 2 systems and 3 replicates each comes up to 62.4h. This may

546

limit the ability of the model to be used as an online applicaKon as it would require access to GPUs. The

547

workÔ¨Çow is, however, applicable in PCs with NVIDIA GPUs.

548

Another limitaKon that should be acknowledged is that, in this study, we examined only one type of

549

force Ô¨Åeld (CGenFF). Future applicaKons could examine whether using other types of force Ô¨Åelds like

550

gaÔ¨Ä2 from AMBER and GROMOS from GROMACS can produce bewer predicKons than CGenFF.

551

Finally, on the experimental side, it should be acknowledged that for the purposes of this study, we

552

tested only two solvents for our LC gradient, HPLC water and methanol. As the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency of

553

chemicals is known to vary by diÔ¨Äerent solvents53, the eÔ¨Äect of that variability on the modeling

554

calculaKons is something that needs to be invesKgated further.

555
556

CONCLUSION

557

Our study presents a novel approach for modeling the ionizaKon eÔ¨Éciency of organic molecules. Our

558

approach can be used in combinaKon with exisKng approaches for concentraKon esKmates of chemical

559

compounds in environmental and biological samples. While there is a variety of modeling approaches

560

for RRF, our view is that these approaches are complementary rather than compeKng. When trying to

561

esKmate concentraKons of chemicals in environmental or biological samples, combining the results of

562

mulKple diÔ¨Äerent approaches can help establish mulKple layers of evidence that can be used in support

563

of a predicKon when analyKcal standards are unavailable.
