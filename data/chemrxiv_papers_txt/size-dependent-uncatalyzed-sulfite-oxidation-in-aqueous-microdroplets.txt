ABSTRACT
Aqueous aerosols and microdroplets exhibit unique chemical kinetics relative to the bulk phase.
Aqueous aerosol and microdroplet chemistry, as it relates to multiphase atmospheric chemistry,
also has major impacts on air quality and climate. Here, we have investigated uncatalyzed oxidation
of sulfite (SO32−) to sulfate (SO42−) by O2 in aqueous microdroplets deposited on a
superhydrophobic substrate, as a function of size, gas-phase composition, and temperature utilizing
an environmental cell and in-situ micro-Raman spectroscopy. We show that the uncatalyzed sulfite
oxidation driven by O2 in aqueous microdroplets is size-dependent across varying O2
concentrations and temperatures. Sulfite oxidation rates scale with the surface-area to volume ratio
(i.e. 1/radius) of the microdroplet and oxidation occurs in the absence of any added catalysts. We
use a resistor-based approach to model multiphase mass transfer and reaction in the experimental
system and confirm that the observed size-dependent kinetics are consistent with slow bulk kinetics
coupled with an efficient reaction at the interface (kII = 9.44×10-3 M-1 s-1, γs,0 = 9.27×10-10 at 298 K
and 21% O2). Above a critical droplet radius, bulk kinetics dominate, but for sufficiently small sizes,
which are relevant in the atmosphere, rates are accelerated due to the role of interfacial reaction.
These results provide insights into chemistry in microcompartments and provide an outlook for
improved representations of sulfate formation in atmospheric droplets and aerosols in large-scale
atmospheric chemistry models.

1. INTRODUCTION
Aqueous microdroplets are unique microreactors; compared to bulk phase solutions, the airwater interface in these systems enhances reaction rates and enables redox chemistry.1-10 This has
been ascribed to enhanced mass transfer,11 differences in bulk and surface pH,12 molecular
orientation, interfacial propensity, and interfacial electric field effects.13-15 Interfacial electric field
effects have been suggested to contribute to redox processes.15-18 Examples include the spontaneous
oxidation of salicylic acid and aromatic sulfones,19-20 changes in oxidation states of interfacial
iodine,21 and the spontaneous generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).8, 22-23 However, the
dominant factors for interfacial enhancement of specific reaction pathways continue to be poorly
understood, inhibiting our ability to model these important processes in an atmospheric chemistry
context.
The oxidation of S(IV) (SO32− , HSO3−, and/or SO2·H2O) to form S(VI) (SO42−, HSO4−, and/or
H2SO4) is fundamental for understanding air quality (haze formation) and acid rain. However, urban
haze events in Asia are inadequately explained by current mechanisms including only cloudwater
processes derived from bulk phase aqueous chemistry, which successfully model sulfate formation
in the U.S. and Europe.24 The missing sulfate content scales with the aerosol water content,25
indicating that the multiphase oxidation of SO2 in or on aqueous aerosols plays a critical role in
more polluted environments. Since S(IV) oxidation pathways are highly sensitive to ionic strength
and the pH of the reaction medium, as well as the role of the gas-aerosol interface, it is not possible
to directly extrapolate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics for cloud-water conditions to aerosol
conditions, necessitating laboratory and modeling studies in the aqueous aerosol.26-30
Recent studies suggest that S(IV) oxidation is accelerated in micron-sized aqueous aerosols
compared to bulk solutions3-5, 26-35 This includes different microdroplet-mediated S(IV) oxidation
pathways such as uncatalyzed oxidation,26-28 transition metal ion (TMI)-catalyzed interfacial
oxidation,4-5 and interfacial NO2-assisted oxidation.3, 36 Several mechanisms have been proposed
for these reactions. Zhong et al.33 suggested that an H2O···SO2 intermediate at the interface
contributes to the solvation of SO2 at the water surface. The Hoffmann group observed rapid S(VI)
formation via the uncatalyzed oxidation pathway by a direct interfacial electron transfer from S(IV)
to O2 to form sulfur radical species at the droplet surface.27-28 Both the reduced hydrogen-bonding
network of water molecules at the gas-aqueous interface and interfacial electric fields play a
significant role in the oxidation reaction.3, 20, 23, 36-37
Uncatalyzed oxidation, wherein S(IV) is oxidized directly by O2,38 has been relatively less
studied, in part because the first-order rate constant (~10−5 s−1) in bulk solution is too slow to be
atmospherically significant, particularly at atmospherically relevant pH.35, 39 However, recently,
Hung et al.27 demonstrated that the rate of this uncatalyzed oxidation is approximately 1-2 orders
of magnitude higher than that by H2O2 oxidation for 1.0 ppbv H2O2 interacting with 50 μg/m3 of
aerosols with diameters of 1-16 μm. Chen et al.26 showed that the SO2 uncatalyzed oxidation in the
aqueous droplets with radii of 4-7 μm is much faster than TMI-catalyzed oxidation at high ionic
strength and acidic conditions (pH 3.5-4.5). Additionally, Li et al.35 reported that S(IV) oxidation
through different oxidation pathways, including uncatalyzed oxidation, scales with droplet surface
area, highlighting the significant influence of droplet size on this reaction. Given the rapid oxidation

rate in aqueous droplets, the uncatalyzed reaction may significantly contribute to atmospheric
sulfate formation. However, until now there has been insufficient experimental data and no
modeling framework to enable representation of this process in atmospheric chemistry models in
order to test its environmental significance.40-41
In this study, we measured the oxidation of SO32− in microdroplets deposited on a
superhydrophobic substrate using micro-Raman spectroscopy to better understand dissolved sulfite
oxidation as a function of microdroplet size, gas-phase oxygen concentration, and temperature. We
used an additive resistance-based model to analytically simulate multiphase mass transfer and
reactions, showing that the observed size-dependent kinetics are consistent with an efficient
interfacial reaction coupled with slower bulk kinetics.

2. METHODS
2.1 Chemicals and Materials
Sodium sulfite (98.5%) was purchased from Thermo Scientific. Sodium sulfate (≥99.0%,
certified ACS), sodium chloride (≥99.0%, certified ACS), and hydrochloric acid solution (1 m)
were obtained from Fisher Chemical. The quartz substrates for supporting the microdroplet were
purchased from Alfa Chemistry. The Cab-O-SIL® TS-720 was purchased from Inoxia Ltd. All gases,
including nitrogen (medical national formulary grade), oxygen (ultra-high purity grade), and a
mixture containing 21% oxygen balanced in nitrogen, were sourced from Airgas. Milli-Q water
(18.2 MΩ·cm-1, 4 ppb of Total-Organic-Carbon (TOC)) used for all experiments was obtained from
a Milli-Q® Advantage A10® Water Purification System (Millipore SAS - Molsheim, France). The
superhydrophobic substrate, with a contact angle of 160.1 ± 3.35° (see Figure S1), was produced
by dip-coating a quartz plate into a solution of Cab-O-SIL® TS-720 suspended in acetone (20
mg/ml), followed by air drying at 200 °C on a hot plate.42
2.2 Micro-Raman Spectroscopy Experiments
Bulk solutions were prepared with oxygen-free Milli-Q water (Milli-Q water purged with

117

nitrogen) in order to reduce the potential influence of water-soluble oxygen. The 1.2 mol/kg Na2SO3

118

solution was prepared with an initial pH of 9.5. This pH was not further adjusted because at this

119

pH, there is essentially one S(IV) species, SO32−, presented in in the bulk solution, thus limiting the

120

number of oxidation reactions taking place in the solution and simplifying kinetic analysis (Figure

121

S2). A high pH also reduces the potential influence of trace concentrations of TMI (i.e. catalyst

122

species) that inevitably originate from Milli-Q water or the chemical reagents used here, according

123

to previous studies.4, 43 Microdroplets were generated from the bulk solutions by using a nebulizer

124

and collected on a superhydrophobic quartz substrate. The hydrophobic substrate with aerosols was

125

transferred to a sealed environmental cell (Linkam, THMS600 Stage) connected to a humidity

126

control system (see Figure S3). The relative humidity (RH) within the environment cell was set at

127

~80 ± 3%. This was controlled by adjusting the ratio of dry and wet gases and monitored by a

128

hygrometer (Buck, CR-4) 4 The droplets were monitored in-situ with micro-Raman spectroscopy

2.3 Quantification of Sulfate and Sulfite Concentrations
To quantify the concentrations of sulfate ([SO42−]) and sulfite ([SO32−]) within the microdroplets

135

during the oxidation reaction, calibration curves were established. The calibration curves of [SO42−]

136

and [SO32−] were obtained from the peak area ratios of sulfate (vs(SO42−) at 980 cm−1) or sulfite

137

(vs(SO32−) at 934 cm−1 and va(SO32−) at 966 cm−1) respectively to water (v(OH)water at 3420 cm−1, a

138

broad peak from 2700 to 3800 cm−1). These peak areas were derived from the Raman spectra of

139

standard Na2SO4 and Na2SO3 solutions at various concentrations in units of molality (m, mol/kg).

140

The Raman peak for H2O, v(OH)water, was applied as an internal standard.12 The sulfate calibration

141

curve was constructed first with an excellent linear correlation (see Figure S4). The sulfate

142

concentration was determined as follows, where ksulfate represents the slope of 46.7 m determined

143

from the calibration curve.

Interestingly, even in the fresh Na2SO3 solution, small amounts of SO42- are present, showing
that the Na2SO3 solution can be oxidized under air. Therefore, the Raman spectra of standard
Na2SO3 solutions were collected under nitrogen to prevent further oxidation by air. As shown in
Figure S5a, the Raman peak of vs(SO32−) is accompanied by a smaller peak of vs(SO42−) at 980
cm−1.44 However, this coupled peak hinders the quantification of the vs(SO32−) peak area. Hence, a
peak analysis method was employed to determine the peak area of vs(SO32−) after curve fitting the
vs(SO42−) peak (Figure S5b). Subsequently, the calibration curve of sulfite was obtained (Figure
S5c). The sulfite concentration was determined based on equation 2, where ksulfite is the slope of
67.1 m in Figure S5.

The values of the inverse sulfate formation timescale (1/τsulfate, min−1) were determined by fitting
ln(Csulfite,t/ Csulfite,t=0) as a function of t following Equation 4 (see Figures S6 to S9 for two different
O2 concentrations and three different temperatures). 1/τsulfate was analyzed as a function of these
experimental parameters for different values of droplet radius, r (μm), which was measured with
the optical microscope equipped on the micro-Raman spectrometer.
We further analyzed reaction kinetics in the sulfite oxidation system using an additive resistance
approach following Worsnop et al.45 In a multiphase system, many potential processes, including
gas or in-particle diffusion, mass accommodation, slow or fast bulk reactions, and reactions at the
surface of the particle could be taking place in series or in parallel. The relative timescales of these
processes determine the overall rate of the process, as well as the characteristic shape of the
measured sulfate concentration profiles and the apparent dependence on particle size, O2
concentration, and temperature. Further details are provided in section 3.3.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Size Dependent Kinetics
Figure 1a presents the Raman spectrum of a sulfite oxidation reaction within an aqueous
microdroplet on a superhydrophobic substrate compared to a bulk solution under 21% O2 condition
and 298 K in the environmental chamber held at 80% RH. The superhydrophobic substrate keeps
the geometry of microdroplets nearly spherical and the radius of the droplets was stable during the
reaction (see Figure S10). The dominant species, sulfite (vs(SO32−) at 934 cm−1 and va(SO32−) at 966
cm−1), was observed.4, 46 As the reaction progresses, the Raman peak for sulfate, vs(SO42−) at 980
cm−1 increases. This oxidation rate increases as the microdroplet size decreases. Notably, for a 1.8
μm microdroplet, the vs(SO32−) decreases significantly within 16 minutes, accompanied by a
significant increase in the vs(SO42−) peak intensity. This observation suggests that the microdroplet
environment accelerates sulfate production.

and [SO32−]. (c) The schematic diagram displaying the size-dependent oxidation. All spectra were
collected at 298 K with RH of ~80 ± 3%.

The reaction kinetics were tracked in-situ for sulfite ([SO32−]) and sulfate ([SO42−]) concentration.
Figure 1b shows the time evolution of [SO42−] within both bulk solution and microdroplets with
radius ranging from 1.5 to 112.0 μm, indicating that the sulfate production rate increased with
decreasing microdroplet radius. A continuous increase in [SO4²⁻] was observed for bulk solution
and large microdroplets (≥3.7 μm), which is in accordance with the results reported by Wang et al.5
and Jing et al.31 For the 8.3 μm microdroplet with sulfite as the sulfur source and no catalyst, an
inverse sulfate formation timescale (1/τsulfate) of 2.84×10−3 min−1 was observed, which is similar to
that (2.25 ×10−3 min−1) reported by Li, et al. for uncatalyzed oxidation of S(IV) by oxygen in the
7.0-μm microdroplet. The oxidation rate constant further increased to 2.75×10−2 min−1 when the
radius of the aqueous aerosol decreased to 1.5 μm, which is more than two orders of magnitude
higher compared to that in the bulk solution (1.93×10−4 min−1). These results suggest an enhanced
uncatalyzed oxidation in the small aqueous aerosol (Figure 1c) and highlight the significant role of
the aerosol size and interface in sulfate formation.35

(r) under 9% and 21% O2 conditions. 1/τsulfate increased with decreasing microdroplet size, and rates
were slower under 9% O2. This finding is consistent with our expectations that O2 drives oxidation
in this system. This is further demonstrated in control experiments: no oxidation was observed after
replacing 21% O2 with N2 (0% O2), as depicted in Figure 2a. These results demonstrate that this
uncatalyzed oxidation occurs at the air-water interface for droplets deposited on a
superhydrophobic surface.

Figure 2. Reaction kinetics of sulfite oxidation within single microdroplet under different ambient
conditions. (a) The inverse sulfate formation timescale (1/τsulfate) scales with the inverse of the droplet
radius (1/r) under different oxygen concentrations (0%, 9%, and 21%). All spectra were collected at 298
K with a RH of ~80 ± 3%. (b) 1/τsulfate scales with the inverse of the droplet radius under different
environmental temperatures (278, 288, and 298 K). All spectra were collected at 21% O2 with a RH of
~80 ± 3%. Dashed lines represent the model simulation results (Section 3.3).

These experiments were also carried out at three different temperatures (298, 288, and 278K) to
study the effect of temperature on sulfite oxidation rates. Figure 2b shows 1/τsulfate as a function of
1/r at 278, 288 and 298 K. As seen, the sulfite oxidation rate increased with increasing temperature
at a fixed RH of 80%. Although there is a fair amount of scatter in these single microdroplet
measurements, these data show that the increasing the temperature from 278K to 298K increases
the rate of sulfate formation by at most a factor of two in this size range.
3.3 Kinetic Modeling
We applied the additive resistance model to evaluate the relative contributions of possible
processes in this multiphase kinetic system to the observed S(IV) oxidation. After analyzing the
possible limiting cases,45 we can eliminate some scenarios (e.g. domination by slow particle-phase
reaction) based on the observed size dependence, and others based on the anticipated rate compared
to our observed rates (i.e., processes limited by the rate of collision of O2 with the surface are ruled
out due to very high O2 collision rates and moderate observed reaction rates). Additionally, we
eliminate scenarios limited by in-particle diffusion or gas phase diffusion, which both have short
sulfate formation timescales that are incompatible with moderate observed reaction rates, and differ

from the observed size dependence (Figure 3). We conclude that an efficient (but not fast) interfacial
reaction in parallel with a slow bulk reaction best describes the experimental system. This is
consistent with recent studies of S(IV) oxidation chemistry.35

Figure 3. Timescale analysis shows that in-particle diffusion yields high rates which are unlikely
to account for the moderate oxidation observed in experiments. The lines for gas phase diffusion
and in particle diffusion overlap, although gas phase diffusion is even faster (timescale ~10−7). The
critical radius is given by the point where the timescales for the bulk-limited and surface-limited
processes cross.
For this scenario, the overall uptake coefficient is represented by the resistances of the surface
reaction and bulk reaction in series:45

The concentration of S(IV) is given by Equation 6. The two parallel processes are encompassed
in the timescale of sulfate formation, which accounts for a slow bulk reaction, in which case [O2]
is uniform throughout the aerosol and is in equilibrium with the gas surrounding the particle, and
an efficient interfacial reaction, where the unknown surface analogs of the Henry’s law constant,
rate constant, and equilibrium constant for the partitioning of SO32− to the surface are represented
by a single parameter, β (Equations 7-10).

and k2,s, Hs, Ks are surface analogs of the bulk rate constant, Henry’s law constant, and equilibrium
constant, respectively.
We use Monte Carlo (MC) analysis to find optimal values of k2 and β and obtain fits from
experimental data;47 as we know, k2 relates to γrxn and β relates to γs,0. After generating 10,000
random samples from a joint k2 and β distribution, we minimize the weighted sum of squares
between the derived concentration profile and the experimental data, where more importance is
given to datasets with more points, which typically correspond to smaller radii. To assess the
confidence for the fitted parameters and provide a range for potential values, we select the top 5%
of samples with the smallest weighted sum of squares, i.e. those exhibiting the best performance.
This analysis shows that the system is more sensitive to β than it is to k2. To further refine the
parameter space given this relative insensitivity to k2, we use the critical radius reported by Li et
al.35 as the size where the dominant process transitions from surface to bulk kinetics (Figure 3). For
uncatalyzed O2 oxidation at pH 9, which is consistent with our experimental conditions, they
reported a critical radius of 213 μm (+62/-48). We used this to place bounds on k2, as this radius
should represent the size at which the formation timescales from the surface and bulk reactions are
exactly equal. From this analysis, we determine β = 8.42×10-10 at 298 K, and k2 = 9.43×10-3 M-1 s1
.
Using these parameters the model represents the experimental data well (Figure 2). We quantify
the goodness of fit across experiments and obtain R2 values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, and with
corresponding normalized RMSEs of 0.4 and 0.2 respectively (Table S1). The timescale itself
depends linearly on O2 concentration, and so the experimental observations for O2 dependence can
be readily replicated (Figure 2a). Several parameters in our system depend explicitly on
temperature (including the Henry’s law constant and 𝜔 ), but β also exhibits temperature
dependence (Equation 11). By fitting our parameters to experimental results, we derive an
expression for β which applies over the given temperature range and observe the same positive
correlation between high temperatures and enhanced rates as is observed in the experimental data
(Figure 2b).

We find that the overall sulfate formation timescale obtained by the model replicates experimental
results for the formation timescale and concentration profile of S(VI) across temperatures (Figure
2b).
Our kinetic parameters were verified by comparing potential sulfate formation timescales to
constant and
experimentally observed data for various ratios of 𝛾 and 𝛾 . We hold 𝛾
change 𝛾 to be a factor of 10, 100, 1000x 𝛾 . Importantly, if 𝛾 < 𝛾 , the system would no
longer exhibit the correct size dependence, making this possibility unlikely. We find that our value
of 𝛾 , which is approximately 100x 𝛾 , yields timescales that are consistent with experimental
results (Figure 4). We can also observe that for large particles (small 1/r), a more moderate 𝛾 ,
closer to bulk kinetics, is sufficient to match experimental data; for smaller particles (high 1/r), 𝛾
to be consistent with experimental results, implying that surface chemistry is
must be 100x 𝛾

3.4 Proposed Mechanism
It is well known that the hydrogen-bonding network, stratification of ions and even the selfionization of water play roles in the unique reactions within microdroplets.13, 20, 23 Intriguingly, the
va(SO32−) and vs(SO42−) frequencies in the microdroplets studied here are slightly shifted from bulk
values (Figure 1), which may suggest unique environments in these confined microdroplets. 48 As
reported, near the air-water interface of microdroplets, water auto-ionizes to generate OH− and H+,23,
37, 49
producing the OH•, H atom and solvated e− in the presence of the strong interfacial electric
field (R2-R4). H2O2 is formed via the recombination of OH• (R5) or HO2• (R6-R9). Furthermore,
Christian and co-workers showed that OH- facilitates H2O2 formation in microdroplets.49 H2O2 may
directly oxidize SO32− (R6). However, in this study we observed that O2 is required for SO32oxidation. This suggests either that R5 is a negligible source of H2O2 in this system or that R6
proceeds slowly. H2O2 may also be formed from O2 via R7-R10, a mechanism which requires the
participation of H+, although our reaction conditions are basic. It has been reported that H3O+ is
enriched at the air-water interface while OH− is mainly located beneath the interface.50 OH− also
can be repelled from the interface.51 Therefore, some H+ is available even under high pH
conditions.49 However, considering the higher charge density and greater electron-donating
capability (i.e., reducing ability) of SO₃²⁻ relative to OH⁻, it is also plausible to consider the
formation of SO3•− and solvated e− at the microdroplet surface (R11). SO3•− can be oxidized directly
by O2 (R12). The formed e− can also react with O2 at the microdroplet surface to generate O2− (R7),
thereby contributing to H2O2 formation.

Scheme 1. Schematic of proposed sulfite oxidation mechanisms at the air-water interface and
within aqueous aerosols.
As indicated by the model simulation, sulfite oxidation in this system proceeds through an
efficient interfacial process alongside a slower bulk process. We propose that both the H2O2
oxidation pathway (R6-R10) and the SO3•−reaction mechanism (R11-R14) reported by Hung et
al.27-28 are plausible. Both processes may be enhanced at the interface. The key points discussed
here are summarized in Scheme 1 for the oxidation reaction at air-water interface.
The schematic shown proposes a gradient in ions and different species at the interface, i.e. the
stratification of ions as discussed by Litman et al.52 Sulfate ions have been shown to have a
propensity to move towards the aqueous bulk,53 and sulfite may reside at the near-surface region
(but not at the interface).53 A hydration layer at the interface may provide a buffer for direct surface
collisions.1 These factors may explain the relatively low reactive uptake probabilities inferred in
this study.

4. Environmental Implications
While the interfacial reaction clearly leads to enhanced rates in the experimentally generated
particles (<5 μm in radius in this study), we can further utilize our model to extrapolate these results
to the important and most atmospherically relevant size range for aqueous aerosols (including
submicron sizes). We find that the sulfate formation timescales in atmospherically relevant particles
are smaller than in larger particles, indicating that oxidation takes place more quickly, likely due to

the rate enhancement from an efficient interfacial reaction (Figure 5a). As compared to larger
particles from laboratory experiments, formation timescales are ~1 order of magnitude smaller. The
value of 1/τsulfate for a particle of radius 0.24 μm, which is the average size in a typical sulfate
distribution, is 0.108 min−1.54 This result indicates that efficient size-dependent chemistry is likely
important in the atmosphere and could account for some of the missing sources of sulfate formation.
Future implementation of the modeling framework developed here into atmospheric chemistry
models will be necessary to test its relative significance.40-41

atmospherically relevant region highlighted, plotted on a semi-log scale. The shaded region
corresponds to the important size range of 0.1 to 1 μm.
Interestingly, the relative contributions of the bulk and surface processes (assuming the same
kinetic parameters apply for an atmospherically relevant size range as to the larger microdroplets),
show that the contribution of the surface reaction to the overall reactive uptake coefficient is
significantly larger for smaller particles. As shown in the Figure 5b, the contribution of surface
processes can account for nearly 100% when the aerosol radius is below 10 μm, then gradually
decreased to ~50% when the aerosol radius is 200 μm. This is consistent with the observations of
Li et al.35 , who noted the importance of the interfacial pathway for this system below the critical
radius of 213 μm (Figure 5b).
Surface reactions for small particles are ~100 times faster than bulk-phase, and we show that the
sulfate formation rate scales with increased temperatures and O2 concentrations across the size
distribution. This underscores the critical role of size-dependent chemistry in sulfate formation,
potentially enhanced by the air-water interface of the aqueous aerosol. The interfacial electric field
at the aqueous aerosol surface potentially initialized this enhanced surficial uncatalyzed oxidation.
Overall, we show that size-dependent uncatalyzed sulfite oxidation is likely important in the
atmosphere, and these insights will be used to improve model predictions of atmospheric sulfate
formation.
