ABSTRACT: Ion exchange shows promise for recovering phosphate from wastewater as value-added products, but requires
high phosphate selectivity to compete with conventional treatment. Hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resins, which contain nonselective basic functional groups and selective iron oxide nanoparticles (FeOnp), can effectively remove phosphate from
wastewater. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the mechanisms of phosphate selectivity and influence of competing
ions, hindering needed efforts to model adsorption dynamics and design scalable adsorption processes for varying
wastewaters. To address these gaps, we integrated aqueous-phase adsorption analysis with solid-phase, synchrotron-based
X-ray characterization; this integration facilitated elucidation of the distribution and speciation of iron, phosphate, and
competing anions on HAIX resins. We compared a quaternary ammonium-functionalized HAIX resin (SBA) to a tertiary amine
version (WBA) to determine the role of functional groups. X-ray radiography revealed differences in FeOnp speciation
(goethite vs. ferrihydrite) and distribution (peripheral vs. homogeneous) between the resins, resulting in varied phosphate
affinity and intraparticle diffusion resistance. Using micro-X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) and micro-X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (μ-XANES) spectroscopy, we identified differences in where and how phosphate binds across resin types and
wastewaters. Across wastewater compositions, FeOnp sites in WBA contribute more to phosphate adsorption than in SBA,
possibly due to variations in Fe distribution and speciation. Phosphate adsorption densities calculated from quantitative μXRF maps matched those from aqueous analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of this integrated approach. Overall, results
demonstrate the use of synchrotron-based X-ray characterization for investigating adsorption mechanisms and advance HAIX
as a phosphate recovery technology from complex wastewaters.

Introduction
Phosphorus is a key component of agricultural fertilizer but
faces environmental and scarcity challenges stemming from
mining phosphate rock. Fluctuations in phosphate content,
impurities, and limited accessibility to phosphate reserves
have decreased mineral quality and increased mining
costs.1,2 Globally over 220 million metric tons (MMTs) of
phosphate rock are mined annually,3 and 80% of the mined
phosphorus is used for fertilizers. However, less than 40%
of the phosphorus in applied fertilizers is taken up by
plants,4,5 and the excess phosphorus in field runoff
contributes to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms.
Phosphate recovery from wastewater provides an
opportunity to circularize existing linear phosphorus
management and offset dependence on phosphate rock. For
example, over 3.6 MMTs of phosphate can theoretically be
recovered from municipal wastewater,6 with additional
phosphate potentially recovered from agricultural runoff
(Figure S1).
Conventional phosphate management techniques (e.g.,
adsorption, biological treatment, chemical precipitation)
from waste sources (e.g., municipal wastewater, corn
refineries) prioritize removal over recovery to meet the
strict discharge requirements of wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs).7–10 Additionally, established phosphate
recycling practices apply sludge biosolids as a fertilizer and
soil conditioner in agriculture. However, phosphate
recycling from biosolids presents significant challenges,
including the presence of hazardous substances (e.g.,
pathogens, heavy metals, and organic micropollutants),
limited phosphorus bioavailability for plant uptake, and low
product purity due to low phosphorus selectivity.11
Selective adsorbents provide an effective approach to
wastewater phosphorus management, enabling both
efficient phosphate removal and recovery of high-purity
phosphate products via chemical regeneration. Specifically,
hybrid anion exchange resins (HAIX) (crosslinked
polystyrene containing quaternary ammonium moieties
(R4N+) and doped with ferric oxide nanoparticles (FeOnp))
achieve >95% phosphate removal from synthetic and
municipal wastewater with competing anions (e.g., Cl-, SO42, HCO3-) even at dilute phosphate concentrations (0.26-10
mg P/L).12–14 Chemical regeneration with commercial base
(i.e., NaOH) and electrochemically produced base (i.e.,
mixture of NaOH and NaCl) recovered >95% of adsorbed
phosphate from HAIX sites.9,13,15 FeOnp dopants in HAIX
accelerated column regeneration due to shortened
intraparticle diffusion length compared to undoped (no
FeOnp) strong base anion exchange (SBA) resins.14 Using
HAIX, recovered phosphate can be transformed into
valuable products, such as hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)5(OH))
when paired with calcium12 or struvite (MgNH4PO4⋅6H2O)
when paired with ammonium and magnesium.16
Adsorption conditions (e.g., solution pH, competing anions,
and aqueous phosphate speciation) influence the capacity
and selectivity of adsorptive phosphate recovery. Solution
pH controls the relative abundance of different phosphate
species (Figure S2), which exhibit unique affinities towards
functional groups in HAIX (for R4N+ groups: PO43- > HPO42- >

H2PO4- > OH-). Similarly, the charge on FeOnp (i.e., FeOH2+,
FeOH, or FeO-) depends on solution pH (Figure S3) and
influences the nature of bonds between anions and FeOnp
sites.12,17,18 At circumneutral pH, phosphate adsorption
occurs via inner-sphere ligand complexation with FeOH,
and phosphate selectivity is achieved by the rejection of
competing anions (e.g., Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-) that only form
outer-sphere (electrostatic) complexes.13 To enhance
phosphate recovery and integrate HAIX into wastewater
treatment, it is essential to optimize adsorption conditions.
Dynamic adsorption modeling and process optimization
require an understanding of the mechanisms underlying
phosphate affinity in HAIX, specifically (1) where and how
phosphate binds in HAIX resins and (2) how wastewater pH
and competing ions (including organic matter) affect
phosphate adsorption.
To date, mechanistic insights into HAIX phosphate
selectivity have been limited to aqueous characterization
(e.g., ion chromatography, spectrophotometry) by
monitoring dissolved anion concentrations under different
conditions. This approach provides a foundational
understanding of adsorption behavior but leaves gaps in
knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms that
govern selectivity. Specifically, aqueous characterization
cannot distinguish phosphate binding to FeOnp sites versus
functional groups in the polymeric matrix, limiting
understanding of intrinsic selectivity in complex solutions.
Intrinsic selectivity is vital for deconvoluting contributions
from adsorbents and solutions, which enables systematic
modeling and comparison of various wastewater
compositions. Furthermore, relying on bulk pH does not
completely elucidate functional group speciation because
interfacial ion concentrations and resultant pH can differ
from bulk conditions.19,20 Direct characterization of the
adsorbent is necessary to resolve these limitations.
However, solid-phase characterization of HAIX has been
limited to determining the speciation and distribution of
iron oxides in the polymeric matrix using conventional
techniques, such as XRD (X-ray diffraction) and SEM-EDX
(scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive Xray analysis). While SEM-EDX provides valuable insights
into iron distribution, its limited field of view (typically up
to several mm) restricts the ability to assess heterogeneity
across different resin beads (diameters of 0.3 to 1.2 mm).
Furthermore, XRD cannot detect amorphous iron phases or
assess spatial distribution of iron phase within a resin bead,
both of which are crucial for phosphate affinity in
wastewater.
Synchrotron techniques (e.g., micro-X-ray fluorescence (μXRF), micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (μXANES) spectroscopy, and X-ray radiography)21,22 can
extend the capabilities of conventional techniques and
provide molecular-level insights of chemical composition
and elemental speciation on adsorbent surfaces. For
example, μ-XANES can reveal the oxidation state and local
coordination environment of adsorbed phosphate, while μXRF shows spatial distribution of key elements (i.e.,
phosphorus, chloride, and sulfur species) within resin
structure, highlighting competitive adsorption or fouling

effects.10 Furthermore, the relatively large field of view up
to 25 mm) and microfocused beam (~5 x 5 µm) allows for
high-resolution imaging, and thus the simultaneous
examination of multiple beads, that offers a more
representative analysis. In comparison, SEM-EDX studies
typically focus on a single bead, making them less
representative of the overall sample. Furthermore, SEM is
surface-sensitive, whereas µ-XRF penetrates several
micrometers, making it ideal for elemental mapping.
Finally, radiography with tunable incident X-ray energy can
provide visualization of FeOnp distribution and speciation
within the adsorbent, helping to further reveal how iron
phase and location can be leveraged to enhance phosphate
adsorption in HAIX design. Together, these sensitive,
spatially resolved X-ray techniques explain the distribution
and speciation of iron in the adsorbent, the phosphate
adsorbate, and competing ions (notably chloride and
sulfate), providing a holistic description of phosphate
selection mechanisms.
This study aims to elucidate phosphate adsorption
mechanisms (distribution and speciation) in HAIX resins by
combining aqueous-phase analysis and solid-phase,
synchrotron-based X-ray characterization, applied to both
simulated and real wastewater systems. To understand
how material properties influence phosphate distribution
and speciation, we collected comprehensive information on
iron speciation in SBA- and WBA-HAIX resins with
radiography and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (section
3.1). We complemented aqueous-phase analysis (of
adsorption solution) with direct solid-phase measurements
(of adsorbate, via µ-XRF and µ-XANES) to determine
phosphate distribution and speciation on HAIX postadsorption (sections 3.2 – 3.4). Integrating synchrotron
techniques with established aqueous characterization
illuminated where and how phosphate binds in the resins.
We used this integrated approach to evaluate the effects of
several parameters (adsorbent dose, phosphate
concentration, and presence of competing anions and
organic matter) on phosphate adsorption and selectivity
(section 3.5). Ultimately, our results advance understanding
of molecular-scale adsorption interactions and elemental
speciation within HAIX, and the findings can enable tailored
adsorbent design and application for phosphate recovery.
Materials and Methods
2.1 Aqueous Chemical Analysis
Anion concentrations (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, and PO43-) before and
after adsorption experiments were measured via anion
chromatography (ion chromatography abbreviated IC, 4.5
mM sodium carbonate and 0.8 mM sodium bicarbonate
eluent, suppressed, 1.0 mL/min, AS23-4 µm column at 30
°C) on a Dionex ICS-6000 system (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Total organic carbon concentration was
measured on a Shimadzu TOC-L (Shimadzu Scientific
Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD). Aqueous iron
concentrations were measured via ICP-OES (ICAP 6300 Duo
View Spectrometer, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA).

2.2 Preparation and Characterization of SBA and WBA HAIX
Resins
We used two macroporous anion exchange adsorbents in
this study: (1) a commercial strong-base hybrid anion
exchanger (SBA-HAIX, FerrIXA33E, Purolite, King of
Prussia, PA) with a R4N+ functional group and (2) a customfunctionalized HAIX (WBA-HAIX) resin from a commercial
weak base anion exchange resin (HPR 9600, Amberlite,
Wilmington, DE) with a tertiary amine functional group
(R3N) (Figure S4).
WBA-HAIX functionalization with FeOnp was performed
from a commercial WBA resin, according to a previously
reported protocol23 (full procedure in Method S1 and
schematic in Figure S5). We observed sulfate desorption
from SBA-HAIX while rinsing the resins with water, likely
from FeSO4 used during functionalization.12 Thus, when
preparing WBA-HAIX, we functionalized with FeCl3 as an
alternative precursor that could avoid sulfate desorption.
Photographs of the resins before adsorption are in Figure
S6. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI
Magellan 400 XHR Scanning Electron Microscope,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to obtain magnified
images of the resins (with a 5.0 kV accelerating voltage and
50 µA emission current). SEM images of the resins before
adsorption are in Figure S7.
For simplicity and to focus on the key distinctions between
resin types, we shorten SBA-HAIX to “SBA” and WBA-HAIX
to “WBA” throughout the text. When referring to parent
resins without FeOnp (i.e., only ammonium or amine sites),
we state “without FeOnp”.
2.3 Batch Adsorption Experiments
To understand the effects of competing anions and organic
matter on phosphate selectivity, we used five adsorption
solutions of increasing complexity (full composition in
Table S1). The solutions were (1) a pure 1 mM phosphate
solution, (2) an equimolar solution of 0.5 mM phosphate
and 0.5 mM sulfate (for equivalent conductivity to 1 mM
phosphate), (3) a synthetic wastewater solution (SWW)
modeled after a municipal wastewater influent with
approximately 0.1 mM phosphate, (4) a synthetic
wastewater solution with simulated organic matter (SWW
+ OM) with approximately 0.1 mM phosphate and 0.36 mM
sodium acetate (a surrogate for organic species present in
real wastewater), and (5) real wastewater effluent treated
using anaerobic membrane bioreactor (RWW, Silicon
Valley Clean Water, Redwood City, CA, composition in
Table S1). In addition to these five solutions, we developed
adsorption isotherms by preparing solutions containing
0.05 mM to 50 mM phosphate and 0.5 mM to 100 mM
chloride. All adsorption solutions besides the real
wastewater were prepared with nanopure water (MQ =
Milli-Q, nanopure water with resistivity 18.2 mΩ·cm at 25
°C, Millipore Milli-Q System, Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA) and reagent-grade chemicals purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Because the resin dose (i.e.,
grams of resin per volume of solution) affects the overall

phosphate removal, we conducted experiments at 0.9 g/L
and 2.0 g/L. Sample pH was measured with a pH meter
(FP20, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH).
Resin performance was evaluated using three metrics:
adsorption density, removal efficiency, and intrinsic
phosphate selectivity against competing anions. Equation 1
defines the adsorption density qf (mg of adsorbate/g
adsorbent) for each adsorbate (A = Cl-, SO42-, or PO43-). C0,A
and Cf,A are initial and final adsorbate concentration (mg/L),
respectively, at equilibrium (adsorption measured after 24
hours), VL is the solution volume (L), and M is the mass of
resin (mg).

The removal efficiency for each adsorbate is the amount of

To account for differences in the initial concentrations of
the adsorbates, we calculated the intrinsic selectivity (𝛼) of
phosphate (C0,P and Cf,P) against competing anions (C0,A and
Cf,A) in solution using Equation 3:

2.4 Column Adsorption Experiments
We conducted column experiments to understand the
kinetic uptake of anions during adsorption and desorption
during regeneration. Approximately 4.25 g of dry HAIX
were packed into a column (35 mL volume, 1.5 cm inner
diameter, 20 cm length) and 20 mM phosphate solution was
pumped at 1 mL/min (Masterflex C/L, Vernon Hills, IL). For
phosphate desorption, a 0.1 M NaOH regenerant solution
was pumped at 1 mL/min. Effluent samples from
adsorption and desorption experiments were collected
every 5 - 15 minutes and measured on IC.
2.5 Micro-XRF and Micro-XANES for Anion Distribution and
Phosphate Speciation
We employed several X-ray techniques, including μ-XRF
combined with μ-XANES, radiography, and bulk X-ray
absorption spectroscopy to characterize adsorbent surfaces
before and after adsorption. This multiplex approach
provided comprehensive insights into adsorbate binding
mechanisms and adsorbent performance. Each technique
offers unique advantages, such as differences in element
mapping capabilities, spot size, and field of view (Table S2).
μ-XRF was combined with μ-XANES to determine the
relative distribution of phosphate and competing ions in
adsorbent beads. To prepare samples for μ-XRF and μXANES analysis, unamended and post-adsorption resin
beads (~50 mg) were dried at room temperature and thin-

sectioned (~100-200 µm) using a thin-sectioner (PetroThin
Thin Sectioning System, Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL). Sectioning
was performed to avoid self-absorption due to high
phosphate concentrations in the samples. Prior to
sectioning, resin samples were embedded in epoxy (Epotek
301) and glued to a 3 inch × 1 inch quartz slide.
Two-dimensional μ-XRF maps of phosphorus (P), chloride
(Cl), and sulfur (S) were acquired at SSRL beamline 14-3b.
The measurements were conducted using a double Si (111)
crystal monochromator at an incident X-ray energy of 4150
eV, with a spatial resolution of 5 µm over a 2 × 2 mm section
of a resin-embedded sample. Fluorescence signals were
detected using a seven-element Vortex Si-drift detector. To
minimize X-ray attenuation in air, all samples were
analyzed in a helium-purged chamber.
We analyzed μ-XRF images with Sam's Microprobe Analysis
Toolkit (SMAK 2.0).24,24 MCA (Multi-Channel Analyzer) data,
which consists of raw spectral information collected from
the XRF detector for each image pixel, was fitted to extract
elemental composition. These counts were then converted
to surface concentrations (μg/cm²) using calibration with
reference foils of known concentrations: GaP (101.1
μg/cm²), KCl (98.8 μg/cm²), and CuS (95.9 μg/cm²).
To enable robust comparison between aqueous-phase and
solid-phase results, elemental concentrations (μg/cm²)
were converted to adsorption densities (mg/g). Resin beads
were first differentiated from the epoxy background using
particle statistics in SMAK, which identifies pixels
corresponding to particles within an image and provides
elemental composition data (in μg/cm²). The X-ray
penetration depth into the sectioned resin surface was
estimated using Hephaestus (a tool within the Demeter
package), assuming the composition of HAIX in terms of
FeOnp versus amine/ammonium sites. For SBA, we
assumed that 40% of the total adsorption sites were
FeOnps, and 60% were quaternary ammonium sites. For
WBA, approximately 20% of the sites were assumed to be
FeOnp, and 80% were tertiary amines. These assumptions
were validated through a sensitivity analysis that
minimized the residual sum of squares between aqueousand solid-phase estimations (Figure S8). Finally, elemental
concentrations obtained from SMAK particle statistics were
converted to mg/g by dividing by the penetration depth and
the dry density of the resins (0.7 g/cm³ for both SBA and
WBA). Dry density was used because the resin was dried for
~24 hours before preparing samples for solid-state
measurements.
To understand the chemical speciation of adsorbed
phosphate on HAIX, we complemented μ-XRF with μXANES. Phosphorus K-edge XANES spectra (at energy
~2150 eV) were obtained at multiple spatially resolved
spots on the resin that allowed us to distinguish phosphate
binding interactions, specifically differentiating between its
association with the polymeric matrix and its interaction
with the FeOnp in HAIX. In addition to collecting XANES on
the resins, we collected spectra for various standards
including phosphate adsorbed to (1) strong base anion
exchange resin without FeOnp (IRA 400 chloride form,
Amberlite, Wilmington, DE), (2) weak base anion exchange

resin without FeOnp (HPR 9600), (3) goethite, and (4)
ferrihydrite. Combined μ-XRF and μ-XANES enhances
understanding of the speciation, distribution, and
concentration of phosphorus in HAIX under different
wastewater compositions.
Phosphorus K-edge XANES spectra were processed in
ATHENA25 using background subtraction, normalization,
and averaging. A linear pre-edge function (ranging from
26.4 to 10 eV below the edge) was fitted and subtracted for
background removal and then normalized by fitting a linear
function to the post-edge region (6.3–86.4 eV above E₀).
Additionally, we employed linear combination fitting to
quantify phosphate adsorption onto FeOnp sites and
polymeric sites (quaternary ammonium for SBA and
tertiary amines for WBA). For FeOnp sites, phosphate
adsorption was assessed using both goethite- and
ferrihydrite-adsorbed phosphate as standards, and their
respective contributions were summed to determine total
phosphate adsorption onto FeOnp sites.
2.6 Bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Radiography
for Iron Distribution and Speciation
To examine iron speciation, X-ray absorption spectroscopy
was conducted on virgin SBA and WBA at SSRL beamline 43 (spectra in Figure S9a). The beamline features a Si (111)
double-crystal monochromator (ϕ = 90° orientation) and a
Si mirror for harmonic rejection. For sample preparation,
the beads were finely ground using a mortar and pestle, and
approximately 2 mg of resin were mixed with ~20 mg of
boron nitride to minimize X-ray attenuation during iron
spectral acquisition in transmission mode.
In addition to the sample spectra, we also collected spectra
from various iron standards to quantitatively assess the
iron species present in SBA and WBA (Table S3). Similar to
the sample preparation, the standards—siderite (α-FeCO₃),
Fe(II) sulfate (α-FeSO₄), ferrihydrite (α-(Fe³⁺)₂O₃·0.5H₂O),
hematite ((Fe³⁺)₂O₃), and goethite (α-FeO(OH))—were
prepared by grinding ~1–2 mg of each iron mineral with 20
mg of boron nitride using a mortar and pestle (spectra of
standards shown in Figure S9b).
To investigate iron speciation within SBA and WBA resin
beads, we collected radiographs of iron species in
transmission mode at SSRL beamline 6-2b at different
energies around the Fe absorption edge. The beamline has
a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator (ϕ = 0°
orientation), harmonic rejecting mirror, and vertical
focusing mirror. Radiography while scanning the incident
X-ray energy across the iron K-edge enables spatially
resolved iron distribution mapping over a larger area
compared to other analytical techniques, such as energydispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), making it particularly
suitable for analyzing the 300–1200 µm diameter SBA-HAIX
and WBA-HAIX resin beads in this study.
For radiography sample preparation, resin beads were
embedded in epoxy and sectioned to a thickness of ~100

µm. These thin sections minimized X-ray attenuation from
high iron concentrations, ensuring accurate iron mapping.
Iron XANES radiographs were collected for both SBA and
WBA resins with the following parameters: Region 1 (7050–
7100 eV) at a step size of 5 eV; Region 2 (7101–7161 eV) at
a step size of 1 eV; Region 3 (7162–7203 eV) at a step size
of 2 eV; and Region 4 (7204–7424 eV) at a step size of 5 eV.
These parameters facilitated a smooth Fe XANES spectra for
each radiograph pixel, particularly in the pre-edge region.
For each sample, both sample and reference images were
collected to convert from transmission to absorption
through the Beer-Lambert law with a nonuniform beam
profile. The collected data was analyzed using TXM
Wizard.26 After reference correction, the images were
processed in XANES Wizard within TXM Wizard. To assess
iron speciation variation within the resin beads, each
sample was segmented into two distinct regions: core and
periphery (details in Figure 1 and Figure S10). XANES
spectra from each region were extracted and saved for
further processing. Both bulk and imaging XANES spectra
were processed (background subtracted and normalized)
in the ATHENA suite of Demeter package. Linear
combination fitting was then used to determine the
abundance of iron species.
Results and Discussion
3.1 Iron Distribution and Speciation in Unamended Resins
We used synchrotron-based X-ray techniques to analyze the
distribution and speciation of iron (as FeOnp) in strong base
(SBA) and weak base (WBA) resins prior to adsorption
(Figure 1). Iron distribution on resins has previously been
examined using scanning electron microscopy energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX),14,23 which has
high spatial resolution but high minimum detection limits
and is prone to artifacts. Similarly, iron speciation has been
previously analyzed using XRD and Mössbauer
spectroscopy,27 which have no spatial resolution because
they are bulk measurements. Determining the iron phases
is critical because it will impact the phosphate binding
behavior and stability of the iron oxide nanoparticles.28
Understanding phosphate binding to various iron phases is
essential for optimizing the amount and type of iron phase
in future adsorbent design. Additionally, iron oxide
nanoparticle stability is critical for wastewater applications
to minimize environmental burden from iron desorption
and extend lifetime for cost reduction. Compared to existing
methods (SEM-EDX, XRD, Mössbauer), synchrotron-based
X-ray techniques, such as μ-XRF and radiography, provide
high spatial resolution, a larger field of view (and therefore
more representative as multiple beads can be analyzed),
and lower detection limits. Synchrotron-based methods
also enable quantitative analysis of iron speciation
(comparison of methods in Table S2).

(c) WBA and (d) SBA. Abundance of iron species was obtained by averaging the Fe species abundances in the four resins analyzed.
Error bars are from measurements of four different beads and represent one standard deviation above or below the average.

To quantify iron speciation, we measured bulk X-ray
absorption spectra of both resins and various iron mineral
standards (Figure S9). Linear combination fitting (LCF)
was used to fit the XANES spectra to corresponding iron
phases, revealing a mixture of goethite and ferrihydrite in
both SBA and WBA resins (Figure S10-11, Table S4).
Specifically, bulk WBA exhibited more ferrihydrite (65%)
than goethite (35%), while bulk SBA was predominantly
composed of goethite (80%) with a minor ferrihydrite
fraction (20%).
Previously, FeOnp within resins have been broadly
characterized as hydrated or hydrous ferric oxide, with
limited identification of specific iron phases.27 Belloni et al.
performed Mössbauer spectroscopy to elucidate speciation
of several anion exchange resin types and concluded 100%
goethite for a commercial SBA (LayneRT).27 In their SBA
resin prepared with FeCl3 (same iron precursor as our WBA
sample but different backbone), they observed 60 – 80%
goethite and attributed the other 20 – 40% to either
ferrihydrite or superparamagnetic goethite. 27 Their overall
conclusion of more goethite in the commercial samples
prepared with FeSO4 compared to samples doped with
FeCl3 aligns with our findings of more goethite in SBA than
WBA. The difference in quantitative amounts could be due
to difference in supplier or the lower spatial resolution of
Mössbauer spectroscopy compared to μ-XANES (Table S2).
In addition to bulk spectroscopy, we utilized XANES
radiography, which provides an Fe spectrum for every pixel
of the imaged area. We examined Fe speciation in pixels

from the core of the resin beads and from the periphery to
evaluate whether different diffusion rates of the iron
precursors into the resins could result in different
speciation. LCF revealed that the WBA resin was more
ferrihydrite-rich in both the averaged whole (79%) and
periphery (86%) compared to the core (55%) (Figure 1c).
In contrast, the SBA resin exhibited a more homogeneous
distribution of goethite across the averaged whole,
periphery, and core (70%, 72%, and 71%, respectively)
(Figure 1d). The difference in iron phases is likely due to a
difference in iron precursors (i.e., commercial SBA is
prepared with FeSO4, and WBA was prepared with FeCl3).
The iron phase could also be related to reaction time,
because ferrihydrite is metastable and gradually converts
to more stable phases (goethite, hematite, lepidocrocite)
over time. Thus, extending the reaction time during
functionalization may convert ferrihydrite to goethite.29,29
Using μ-XRF, we observed a uniform, homogeneous
distribution of FeOnp in SBA (Figure 1b). Note that one
resin bead in the field of view as an outlier that exhibited
lower iron concentration in the core than periphery.
However, in WBA, we observed higher FeOnp distribution
on the periphery of the resins (Figure 1a). We attribute the
difference in FeOnp distribution between the SBA and WBA
types to differences in porosity and iron precursors.
Specifically, a lower porosity in WBA likely hindered
diffusion of iron during functionalization, leading to a
higher concentration on the resin periphery. SEM imaging

external surface of SBA was more porous than WBA based
on the number and size of surface pores (Figure S7). To
ensure that our functionalization process was not
responsible for the limited porosity, we also imaged the
unmodified resin (without FeOnp) and observed the same
low external porosity (Figure S7c). WBA resins have less
crosslinking that leads to lower permanent porosity in the
polymeric structure.17,23 Another possible explanation for
the non-uniform FeOnp distribution in WBA is the use of
Fe(III) as a precursor, in contrast to Fe(II) in SBA. Fe(III)
more readily precipitates as iron hydroxides, leading to
localized deposition, whereas Fe(II) remains more soluble
under acidic and neutral pH conditions, allowing for
penetration into the core and more uniform distribution.30
The influence of porosity and iron impregnation on FeOnp
distributions motivates further investigation into rational
adsorbent design to maximize phosphate adsorption and
iron stability.
3.2 Evaluating Phosphate Recovery from Wastewater
Solutions with Synchrotron Techniques
Synchrotron techniques for solid-phase adsorbent
characterization enable comprehensive understanding of
phosphate adsorption distribution and speciation. We
employed μ-XRF to analyze the resins before (Figure S12)

and after adsorption (Figure 2), offering complementary
insights to conventional aqueous-phase adsorption
analysis. Notably, while aqueous analysis indirectly
estimates adsorption density using ion concentrations in
solution before and after adsorption, solid-phase X-ray
techniques enable direct characterization of adsorbates on
the resin surface. The ability to visualize adsorbate
distribution on adsorbent sites enables understanding of
the selective phosphate adsorption mechanism. We tested
and imaged the resins in a series of wastewaters (Table S1)
of increasing complexity to evaluate the impact of
competing ions on phosphate adsorption (Figure 2). μ-XRF
images mapped the distribution of phosphate (as
phosphorus, Figure 2a,c), sulfate (as sulfur, Figure 2b,d),
and chloride (Cl, Figure S13-15) on SBA and WBA resins
after adsorption.
As expected, the phosphorus concentration observed in μXRF mapping varied directly with the phosphate
concentration in the initial wastewater solution. The μ-XRF
map of both resins after adsorption from a 1 mM phosphate
solution showed higher phosphate concentrations than
those after adsorption from a 0.5 mM phosphate solution.
For example, the SBA resin had a mostly homogenous >15
µg/cm2 (35-45 µg/cm2) phosphate concentration after

adsorption from the 1 mM phosphate solution, in contrast
to the 5 - 15 µg/cm2 concentration observed after
adsorption from the 0.5 mM solution. Similarly,
approximately 25 – 50% lower phosphate concentrations
were observed for equimolar P/S (0.5 mM phosphate) and
synthetic wastewater (0.17 mM phosphate) compared to
the 1 mM phosphate solution.
The phosphate concentration of the adsorption solution
also influences intraparticle diffusion and consequently
phosphate distribution. Intraparticle diffusion refers to
internal phosphate diffusion to the adsorption sites in the
resin, as opposed to external phosphate diffusion from the
bulk solution to the resin surface. At low phosphate
concentration (0.1 – 0.5 mM), adsorption was primarily on
the resin periphery (Figure 2a, equimolar P/S and
synthetic WW). At higher initial phosphate concentrations
(1 mM), adsorption was also observed in the core of the
resin (Figure 2a, pure phosphate).
The μ-XRF maps also yielded valuable insights into
differences between SBA and WBA resins in terms of the
distribution of phosphate and sulfate. After adsorption from
a pure phosphate solution, the phosphate distribution
within SBA resin was homogenous and consistent with the
iron distribution in Figure 1b. In contrast, WBA exhibited
high concentrations of phosphorus on the outer resin
periphery compared to sulfur. This distribution was also
consistent with the concentrated peripheral iron observed
in Figure S1a, which was attributed to lower porosity of the
WBA resin. In both SBA and WBA, the overlapping
phosphate and iron distributions indicates selective
adsorption of phosphorus to the FeOnp sites. If phosphate
adsorption primarily occurred at the ammonium functional
groups, we would expect a more homogenous phosphate
distribution across the WBA resin. Instead, the phosphate
distribution closely aligned with the spatial iron
distribution within the resin. The alignment between
phosphorus concentration and iron distribution is
supported by previous work in which resins with more
surface iron exhibited more surface adsorbed phophate.14
We note that intra-batch variation can lead to a few resin
beads with more surface-distributed FeOnp in SBA as well,
such as the lone heterogeneous resin bead in Figure 1b or
the bead with more surface FeOnp in images by Dong et al.14
Unexpectedly, we observed a high concentration of sulfur in
the fresh, pre-adsorption SBA resin (Figure S12, S15) and
the resin after pure phosphate adsorption (Figure 2a, S15)
– both of which should contain no sulfate. We hypothesized
this sulfate resulted from contamination during the
manufacturing process,13,31 which was supported by a lack
of sulfate in the WBA samples prepared with a FeCl3
precursor instead of FeSO4. Similarly, a high background
concentration of Cl was observed in virgin WBA beads
(Figure S12, S14-15) and even in pure phosphate
solutions, primarily due to residual Cl from FeCl₃ used
during the functionalization process. The elevated chloride
concentration at the periphery of virgin beads in both SBA
and WBA is attributed to the epoxy used during sectioning,
which complicates background removal (Figure S12). The
impact of these pre-existing contaminants and counter ions

on the phosphate adsorption performance is discussed
more in section 3.5.1.
3.3 Phosphorus Speciation
To expand upon the insights on phosphate distribution
from section 3.2, we examined phosphorus speciation,
specifically which sites phosphate is binding to, using
phosphorus K-edge μ-XANES (Figure 3, S16-S19). The preedge feature indicates selective binding of phosphate to
iron sites32, supported by the μ-XRF analysis (section 3.2).
We quantified the amount of phosphate that binds to FeOnp
sites versus quaternary ammonium sites by comparing
standards for phosphate binding to only quaternary
ammonium sites and to only FeOnp sites (Figure S20). We
fit μ-XANES spectra to both goethite and ferrihydrite
standards because the pre-edge feature intensity is a
function of denticity as well as the iron phase. Bidentate
phosphate generally corresponds to higher pre-edge
feature intensities, regardless of phase, making it
challenging to fit to specific iron phases.32 However,
because there is no pre-edge feature in phosphate bound to
resins without FeOnp (Figure S20), we can differentiate
between phosphate bound to ammonium sites (no pre-edge
feature) and phosphate bound to FeOnp sites (pre-edge
feature). Note that this analysis differs from the analysis
presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 refers to the total number
of available FeOnp sites in the resin, and Figure 3 refers to
the amount of phosphate bound to these FeOnp sites. For
both SBA and WBA, 1 mM pure P led to higher binding on
quaternary ammonium and tertiary amines as compared to
other conditions, likely due to phosphate penetrating
further into the core and accessing more functional groups.
Additionally, it is likely that 1 mM phosphate saturated
FeOnp sites leading to adsorption on low affinity
ammonium/amine sites. Directly comparing 0.5 mM pure P
and 0.5 mM eq. P/S showed that sulfate lowers phosphate
binding to FeOnp in the core due to competition for sites. In
all solutions, phosphate binding to FeOnp sites was greater
in WBA than in SBA, likely due to the higher ferrihydrite
content in WBA, which provides more surface-active sites
for adsorption compared to the goethite-rich SBA.
In SBA (Figure 3e), phosphate binding to iron was
approximately the same in the periphery and core, which is
supported by the homogenous distribution of phosphate in
the μ-XRF maps (Figure 2). More notable differences were
observed between the periphery and core in WBA (Figure
3f), following the heterogeneous iron distribution (Figure
2). The alignment of phosphate and FeOnp distributions
underscores the selective binding of phosphate to FeOnp
sites.
To elucidate the effect of pH on phosphate binding, we
evaluated phosphate adsorption density and removal in 1
mM phosphate solutions with pH 5, 7, and 9 (Figure S21,
composition in Table S5,). Both the phosphate and FeOnp
speciation in solution will change as a function of pH
(Figures S2 and S3). For phosphate, there is an interplay
between H2PO4- (dominant at lower pH) and HPO42(dominant at higher pH). The more negatively charged
phosphate at higher pH favors attraction to the ammonium

groups. Thus, reducing the pH will reduce binding on
ammonium sites. For iron, there is an interplay between
FeOH2+ (dominant at lower pH), FeOH (dominant at pH 79), and FeO- (dominant at higher pH). The negatively
charged ion groups will repel the negatively charged
phosphate, and thus adsorption on iron sites decreases as
the pH is increased.
In aqueous-phase analysis, phosphate adsorption density
varied between 35 - 45 mg P/g resin across pH solutions for
both SBA and WBA, and adsorption density generally
decreased as the solution pH increased, as expected due to
changing FeOnp speciation.14 Similarly, phosphate removal
efficiency decreased as the pH increased and was higher in
SBA than WBA at all pH values. The decreasing phosphate
uptake with increasing pH further supports phosphate
binding to FeOnp. Increasing pH leads to reduced
phosphate adsorption on FeOnp but little change on

ammonium sites, making elevated pH an effective strategy
for site-selective regeneration.12,23
We complemented the aqueous phase analysis with solidstate characterization to determine any differences in
phosphate binding location (core vs periphery) across
adsorption solutions (Figure S22). In WBA, we observed
the fraction of phosphate adsorbed to FeOnp decrease as
the pH is increased to 9 (Figure S23, S24), again due to the
changing iron speciation to FeO- . The pH of the adsorption
solution (pH 5 and 9) had little effect on the binding sites for
SBA, although a stronger impact is expected at more
extreme pH values. The insights gained into phosphate
binding locations at different pH values are crucial for
understanding the adsorption mechanism in a variety of
wastewaters and regenerant solutions.

3.4 Comparing Solid-Phase Characterization of Phosphate
Recovery with Aqueous-Phase Characterization
To validate the high-resolution insights gained from
synchrotron-based solid-phase analysis, we quantified
adsorption densities from aqueous-phase batch analysis for
both SBA and WBA (Figure 4). Using post-processing in
SMAK 2.0 (full method is described in Section 2.5), we
obtained the phosphate adsorption density values from XRF
maps and compared them to the aqueous adsorption results
(Figure 4). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first to (1) quantify adsorption densities obtained via solidphase, synchrotron-based characterization and (2) directly
compare solid-phase and aqueous-phase adsorption
methods. We used a residual sum of squares analysis to
determine the ratio of FeOnp to ammonium sites that

resulted in the lowest error between aqueous and solidstate measurements across solutions (Figure S8).
Notably, the adsorption densities obtained via quantitative
analysis of the XRF maps closely aligned with those
measured using aqueous analysis (Figure 4), which
validates solid-phase techniques for accurately quantifying
adsorption. Out of the 10 resin-solution pairs tested, only
the SBA pure phosphate conditions showed significant
deviation between aqueous and solid-state measurements
(p-value of 0.0285 for the two means with two-sample ttest). We attribute this difference between aqueous and
solid-state measurements to the high concentration of
phosphate in the resin that reduced the penetration depth
of X-rays. This attenuation results in low fluorescence signal
and hence lower phosphorus counts. Additionally, the

higher Fe concentration in SBA results in a reduced X-ray
penetration depth (SBA: 21 µm, WBA: 37 µm), which may
have also contributed to this difference.
For simplicity, only the 2 g/L resin dose is shown in Figure
4. A comparison of adsorption density and removal
efficiency between 0.9 g/L and 2 g/L resin doses is shown
in Figure S25. Resin doses of 0.9 and 2 g/L were chosen for
initial aqueous analysis to (1) achieve appreciable
adsorption densities that could be observed via solid-state
analysis and (2) avoid the saturating adsorption sites of the
resins, as differentiating between site affinity in
wastewaters is challenging if all of the sites are filled.
Ultimately, the 2 g/L resin dose was prioritized over 0.9 g/L
for synchrotron analysis because it enabled a greater
phosphate removal efficiency that is more relevant to
wastewater treatment applications.
As expected, increasing the resin dose from 0.9 to 2 g/L led
to a decrease in phosphate uptake per g resin and increase

in removal efficiency across all solutions, except for one
statistically significant outlier (WBA in equimolar solution
of phosphate and sulfate with a p-value of 0.0141 after a
two-sample t-test). In the 1 mM pure phosphate solution,
WBA resins exhibited a higher phosphate adsorption
density compared to SBA resins (Figure 3a vs. Figure 3b),
likely due to the high ferrihydrite content that provides
more surface-active sites for phosphate adsorption. Thus,
both resin iron distribution and speciation influence the
phosphate removal performance. Notably, with a higher
resin dose (2 g/L), SBA and WBA removed phosphate from
a variety of wastewaters with over 60% efficiency (Figure
S25). In contrast to pure P solutions, SBA outperforms WBA
in more complex solutions due to a higher number of FeOnp
sites, which other ions cannot bind to via inner-sphere
ligand complexation.14

3.5 Competitive Counterion Adsorption on HAIX
3.5.1 Effect of Inorganic Anions on Phosphate Adsorption
To determine the effect of competing ions in each solution,
we compared phosphate adsorption density in wastewater
to the pure phosphate solutions with equivalent
concentrations (Figure 4). Specifically, the equimolar P/S
solution can be compared to 0.5 mM pure P, and the SWWs
can be compared to 0.1 mM pure P. For both SBA and WBA,
there is no significant difference (p-value = 0.6 and 0.06,
respectively) between the pure phosphate solution and
solution with sulfate, suggesting that sulfate competition
had minimal impact on phosphate adsorption. In contrast,
there was a significant difference for both SBA and WBA
between the pure phosphate solution and synthetic
wastewater (p-value = 0.013 and < 0.00001, respectively),
suggesting that the competing ions in the synthetic
wastewater negatively impacted phosphate adsorption.
Pre-existing anions on the resins can also affect selectivity
measurements. XRF images of virgin resins (preadsorption) show primarily sulfur in SBA (up to 100
ug/cm2) and chloride in WBA (up to 200 ug/cm2) (Figure
S12). Both anions are residual from the iron doping
procedure; FeSO4 and FeCl3 are used for SBA and WBA,
respectively.13,23,31 SBA also contains chloride (up to
approximately 60 ug/cm2), which is the counterion on the
quaternary ammonium groups. A small amount of sulfur
(up to 60 ug/cm2) was observed in WBA. Sulfur has been
observed previously in commercial anion exchange resins,27
and it is likely residual from the synthesis procedure. The
resin was not washed prior to the experiments, which may
have contributed to the observed sulfur content. During
batch and column experiments, the chloride and sulfate are
released either through desorption or exchange during

phosphate adsorption, leading to an increased aqueous
concentration of both species after phosphate adsorption
(Figure S26, S27). In the HAIX systems studied, desorption
refers to a non-phosphate ion leaving the resin because of
its own activity gradient, whereas exchange refers to ion
release due to adsorption of ions of higher affinity or
abundance (Figure S28). We elucidated the leaving
mechanism of each ion (i.e., desorption versus exchange
with phosphate) by comparing their concentrations after
adsorption in a phosphate solution versus nanopure MQ
(Figure S26).
In SBA, chloride release was more prominent after
phosphate adsorption than after soaking in MQ (Figure
S26a, left), aligning with our understanding that chloride is
the counterion on the ammonium groups and exchanges
with phosphate. Sulfate is likely an impurity in SBA from
the manufacturing process. We also observed higher
release in the phosphate solution (Figure S26b, left), which
could be due to sodium counterions facilitating charge
balance in the phosphate solution. Additionally, sulfate may
have replaced chloride on some of the ammonium groups
and be exchanging with phosphate, leading to higher sulfate
concentration in the phosphate solution than the MQ
solution.
WBA was prepared with FeCl3 rather than FeSO4, and
consequently, high chloride release was observed (Figure
S26a, right). Similar to sulfate release from SBA, the
chloride release was higher in phosphate solution
compared to the MQ solution (Figure S26b, right), likely
due to the sodium counterions facilitating charge balance.
We also observed small amounts of sulfate release from
WBA in both MQ and 1mM PP. Similar to SBA, we attribute
the sulfate to impurities from manufacturing.

wastewater, SWW + OM = synthetic wastewater with organic matter, RWW = real wastewater. Error bars not shown are smaller
than symbols. Initial composition of each solution is in Table S1; briefly, sulfate is present in all solutions in Figure 5; chloride is
present in all except for Eq P+S.

Despite ample investigation into HAIX for phosphate
removal, existing literature primarily reports selectivity
values relative to competing anions (e.g., sulfate, chloride,
nitrate) without accounting for initial feed concentrations
or elucidating the kinetic mechanisms that govern
phosphate adsorption in multicomponent solutions. To
elucidate the contribution of FeOnp to phosphate
selectivity, we evaluated the intrinsic selectivity of
phosphate against chloride and sulfate on each resin type
across wastewater solutions (Figure 5). Because chloride
and sulfate are desorbed or exchanged from the resin
during adsorption, the reported selectivity values represent
the overall net selectivity, accounting for both adsorption
and desorption. Chloride desorption hindered the PO43-/Clselectivity in WBA across the chloride-containing solutions.
Excess chloride in WBA from FeCl3 synthesis led to negative
adsorption densities, contrasting with positive adsorption
isotherm values measured after initial chloride removal
with MQ (Figure S27).
At the 2.0 g/L resin dose, phosphate selectivity over sulfate
increases with solution complexity, while selectivity over
chloride gradually decreases across chloride-containing
solutions (Figure 5a, no Cl- in equimolar P + S solution).
This decrease in PO43-/SO42- selectivity is likely due to
surface fouling from organic matter (increasing mass
transfer resistance to sites)21 and competition with
negatively charged natural organic matter for sites.33. In

WBA, relatively constant PO43-/SO42- and PO43-/Clselectivity suggests no solution composition dependence
(Figure 5b). The higher FeOnp distribution on the
periphery of the WBA versus the core facilitates high
phosphate removal (due to less intraparticle diffusion
resistance). However, the remaining tertiary amine sites are
less selective towards anions of different valence at the
studied pH, particularly distinguishing between mono and
divalent anions.17 Furthermore, the chloride leaching in
WBA leads to a negative selectivity compared to SBA.
Similar trends are observed at a 0.9 g/L resin dose (Figure
S29).
3.5.2 Effect of Organic Matter on Phosphate Adsorption
Real wastewater contains a variety of organic matter (OM)
species that can impact adsorption performance.34,35 Using
complementary aqueous- phase and solid- state analysis
methods, we aimed to investigate and quantify the role of
organic matter in phosphate adsorption (Figure 6). TOC
analysis quantified organic matter adsorption (Figure 6a),
while aqueous phosphate analysis evaluated phosphate
adsorption in synthetic wastewater solutions with and
without organic matter (Figure 6b). All other components
are at the same solution concentration in SWW and SWW +
OM, so the only difference is the addition of the organic
matter.

As expected, we observed a reduced phosphate adsorption
capacity in solutions with organic matter due to competitive
adsorption. Specifically, we observed a difference in
phosphate adsorption between synthetic wastewater with
and without organic matter for SBA and WBA (p-value = 2 x
10-3 and < 1 x 10-5, respectively). At the studied pH values,
organic matter is negatively charged and therefore
attracted to the ammonium moieties, affecting the
phosphate adsorption density.36 Further, organic matter
can complex with iron oxides even at circumneutral pH
resulting in a decrease in phosphate adsorption.37,38 The
XRF maps show a reduction (from approximately 8 to 4
µg/cm2) in phosphate distribution on the resin periphery
after adsorption in solutions containing organic matter,
suggesting adsorption of organic matter on both resin types
restricts phosphate adsorption (Figure 6c,d). Compared to
SBA, WBA exhibited a higher TOC removal and adsorption
due to the negatively charged natural organic matter (NOM)
at this pH, which preferentially adsorbs to WBA through ion
exchange.39 Additionally, the greater hydrophilicity of TOC,
combined with a higher affinity for hydrophilic compounds
of WBA due to the greater charge density of its protonated
secondary amino sites compared to the quaternary
ammonium sites of SBA,40 further enhances its removal
efficiency. Observed trends with a 0.9 g/L resin dose were
similar to those described for 2 g/L (Figure S30).
Conclusions
In this study, we developed a quantitative solid-state
characterization method that complements conventional
aqueous analysis of resins for nutrient recovery from
wastewaters. We observed differences in iron speciation
and penetration, resultant phosphate distribution, and
adsorption capacity and selectivity between SBA and WBA
resin types, several of which are attributed to the lower
porosity and likely lower crosslinking of the WBA resin.
Both goethite and ferrihydrite iron phases were observed in
the SBA and WBA resins, but the SBA resin contained
primarily goethite, while WBA was more ferrihydrite
abundant. The speciation of iron nanoparticles in the resin
matrix has implications for long-term performance because
it influences adsorption capacity, binding behavior and
stability. By modifying the functionalization procedure (i.e.,
tuning the pH, reaction time), we can limit the conversion of
ferrihydrite to goethite which can enhance phosphate
adsorption capacity and selectivity. However, the higher
reactivity and amorphous nature of ferrihydrite make it
metastable, potentially reducing its long-term stability in
the polymeric matrix.41 Therefore, optimizing the Fe-phase
composition is key to designing a material with enhanced
stability and adsorption performance. We also observed
and quantified phosphorus distribution changes in the
presence of competing ions and organic matter. The
distribution of phosphate was more heterogeneous for
WBA, due to the lower porosity and high concentration of
iron sites around the periphery. With these insights, the
efficiency of WBA can be further enhanced by selecting a
polymeric matrix with higher porosity and utilizing Fe(II)
precursors, which can reduce the rate of iron

(oxy)hydroxide precipitation compared to the FeCl₃
currently used for functionalization, enabling Fe to
penetrate deeper into the resin bead. Characterization of
phosphorus speciation demonstrated its selective binding
to the FeOnp sites. Notably, the adsorption density
measured by solid-state, synchrotron-based techniques
aligned closely with that from conventional aqueous
analysis, supporting the use of applying these methods to
visualize and quantify adsorption mechanisms within
separation materials.
There are several limitations of this study that will be
addressed in future work, including: (1) our inability to
differentiate between phosphate binding to goethite vs.
ferrihydrite due to difficulty differentiating the pre-edge
feature of the XANES spectra; (2) a lack of characterization
of the complexes formed with organic matter, which was
beyond the scope of this study; (3) the use of acetic acid as
a model compound for organic matter, which may not fully
capture all possible organic interactions with resins; and (4)
only evaluating one synthetic and real wastewater type.
Additionally, we did not explore whether changes to the
WBA functionalization procedure could lead to
homogeneous iron distribution.
There are also several extensions of this study that can be
addressed in future work. The methods we established here
can be expanded to apply to (1) regeneration methods and
(2) other adsorbates (e.g., ammonia). Electrochemical
regeneration can circumvent the greenhouse gas emissions
associated
with
conventional
commercial
base
regeneration,42 and synchrotron-enable characterization
can enhance understanding of regeneration mechanisms.
Future nutrient recovery technologies need to align with
practical applications;43 thus, we will explore the tandem
recovery of ammonium and phosphate within a single
system to enable product fertilizer precipitation (e.g.,
struvite when paired with Mg2+ or hydroxyapatite when
paired with Ca2+). By understanding the binding mechanism
of selective phosphate adsorption and validating solid-state
characterization as a complement to aqueous
characterization, this study provides a fundamental
foundation for designing sustainable systems for phosphate
removal and recovery.
