ABSTRACT
The issue of fossil-based plastics presents a paradox, with conflicting solutions proposed.
While an idealistic vision promotes biodegradable plastics as the ultimate solution, the
reality is that fossil-based plastics dominate production, constituting approximately 99%.
Despite the conceptual appeal of biodegradable plastics, their practical implementation
remains limited with minimal production. Consequently, the current plastic waste
management system faces challenges, with only about 25% of total plastic waste being
recycled in 2023. A significant portion, around 31.2%, is incinerated, and 43.8% ends up
in landfills or is improperly disposed of, reflecting a non-sustainable approach.
Projections suggest a potential increase in recycling rates to nearly 44% by 2050, but
incineration remains alarmingly high at close to 50%. To achieve sustainable growth and
create a carbon and toxic-free environment, there is a need for a renewed commitment to
accelerate the reuse and recycling of plastic waste. Failure to do so risks perpetuating the

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION OF PLASTICS
From the Stone Age through the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, societal evolution has
brought us into the contemporary era, characterized by the transformative impact of
plastics on our way of life1. Commencing with early innovations involving bioplastics,
and rubber such as natural rubber, vulcanized natural rubber, cellulose, cellulose nitrate,
gutta-percha, viscose silk, and shellac from the 1820s to 1900, the subsequent decades
witnessed a shift towards fossilplastics dominating the industry in the 1930s. The 1940s
marked a surge in plastic inventions, largely driven by the needs of World War I and
World War II. Since then, there has been a significant uptick in the utilization of plastics
across various sectors1-4. Beyond advancements in plastics, the period since the early
1960s has seen the introduction of pigments and various additives, facilitating the
application of color and properties to plastic materials5-7. Thereafter, the 1980s and 1990s
marked the emergence of high-performance plastics manufacturing. Over time, these
high-performance plastics have undergone enhancements through the integration of
nanotechnology and composites. As of 2024, a diverse range of multi-type plastics and
their advanced iterations find applications in various sectors, including health, mobility,
communications, energy, food and water, shelter, clothing, protection, sports, and
beyond8-13. In simple terms, plastic has transformed our everyday existence, making life

unimaginable without it. To celebrate this impact, in 1980, the music producer ‘The
Buggles’ released an album titled "The Age of Plastic"14.
Table 1 below presents notable inventions in bio-based and fossilplastics for various
years. Before delving into the details, it is essential to clarify the terms "bio-based" and
"fossil-based." Bio-based plastics typically derive their chemical molecules or monomers
from biomass, while fossil-based plastics are produced using chemical molecules or
monomers derived from petroleum. Secondly, bioplastics can exhibit both biodegradable
and non-biodegradable characteristics, while nearly all categories of fossilplastics are
inherently non-biodegradable15, 16.

Plastics as the future
Bio-based plastics are labeled as (bio-based), while others are referred to as fossil-based plastics. *
Represent first polymerization of vinyl chloride but processing of PVC was not possible.

In the plastic industry, irrespective of the specific properties and types of plastics, they
undergo transformation for their intended purposes through processes like injection
molding, extrusion, blow molding, spinning, and casting3, 18. During the processing of
plastics, a range of additives, including low molecular weight compounds such as
antioxidants, UV stabilizers, processing aids, plasticizers, colorants, flame retardants,
hardeners, accelerators, and blend compatibilizers, as well as fillers and fibers for matrix
reinforcement, are incorporated. These additives enhance processability and contribute to
attaining the desired physical or chemical properties in the end products3, 6. In this context,
a prime illustration is PVC resin, which, owing to its heat sensitivity and considerable
brittleness, was initially (in 1912, Table 1) impractical for direct processing.
Consequently, the processing of PVC resin involved the introduction of plasticizers
(specifically phthalates), heat stabilizers, and other additives to address these challenges3,
19

. The fossil-based plastics highlighted in Table 1 compete effectively with alternative

material classes like glasses and metals. Moreover, contemporary fossil-based plastics
exhibit strong competitiveness by simultaneously lowering costs, enhancing
performance, and promoting sustainability. These plastics possess distinctive attributes,
the capability to be molded effortlessly into diverse shapes suitable for various
applications, and a broad range of available raw materials. Furthermore, their molecular
structure determines whether they exhibit rubbery or glassy characteristics, function as

conductors or insulators of electrical and thermal charge, possess permeable or
impermeable properties, are transparent or opaque, soluble or insoluble, adhere or do not
adhere, emit or absorb light, exist in a solid or liquid state, repel or absorb substances,
and are durable or degradable3, 20-22. Consequently, fossil-based plastics facilitate the
development of new technologies by virtue of their lightweight nature. For instances, they
found applications in fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787, space exploration
vehicles and flights, automobiles, bulletproof clothing, energy-efficient buildings, solar
panels, and high-speed lightweight vehicles 23, 24. There are numerous other applications
of fossil-based plastics based upon their properties and capabilities, including use in
cables, pipes, packaging, and plastic coatings to protect metals from corrosion, among
others25. As well as in medical fields, fossilplastics are employed as contact lenses,
disposable syringes and tubes, 3D printed implants and more26, 27. Furthermore,
fossilplastics have wide-range of applications in agricultural such as greenhouses, mulch,
silage stretch films, and drip irrigation pipes and many more28.
Despite the great achievements of fossil-plastics, bioplastics are still emerging as they are
supposed to be biodegradable in nature. Thus, most of the bioplastics were uses in drugrelease systems, packaging (e.g., bags and bottles), straws, and 3D printed medical
implants29, 30. In the current, not only the development of bio-based plastic but also biobased additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers, reinforcing agents, other type are gaining
a huge attention31. The prominent example is celluloid foams, which was plasticized with
non-phthalate camphor while processing32. In recent, camphor is polymerized with
terpenoid to produce a fully bio-based polyester, in a greater interest of environmentally
friendly plastic33.

Most bioplastics have struggled to compete with the versatile and easily processed fossilbased plastics, which currently constitute approximately 99% of the world's plastic
consumption (refer to Figure 1). In 2023, the global production has surged to 390 million
tonnes due to heightened demand, with fossil-based plastics accounting for around 90.5%,
followed by fossil-based recycled plastics at 8.4%, and bioplastics at 1.1% (as illustrated
in Figure 1). Projections indicate a total plastic production nearing 564 million tonnes in
2050, with fossil-based plastics expected to maintain a share exceeding 90%. Similarly,
bioplastics may represent around 5% of total plastic production. Considering these
estimations, Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of all types of plastics by percentage,
where PE holds the largest share at approximately 26.9%, followed by PP (19.3%), PVC
(12.9%), PET (6.2%), PU (5.5%), and PS (5.3%). The share of all types of bio-based
plastic is only about 1.1%. More specifically, Figure 3 details the distribution of biobased/bio-attributed plastics, with biodegradable bioplastics like polylactic acid (PLA)
holding the maximum share at 18.7%, followed by starch blends (18.7%), polybutylene

bio-polyamide (bio-PA), bio-polypropylene (bio-PP), bio- polytrimethylene terephthalate
(bio-PTT), accounting for about 41% of all bio-plastic production, these materials are
derived from biomass monomers and are thus classified as bioplastics 34. Furthermore,
plastics employed in packaging constitute the majority, comprising nearly 44%, with
building and construction following at 18%, automotive at 8%, electrical and electronics

at 7%, and household, leisure, and sport at 7%. Agriculture, farming, and gardening make
up 4%, while the remaining 12% falls into the other category, as depicted in Figure 4.

INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTS
Similar to the observed plastic production trend discussed earlier, the current trajectory
of resource utilization could potentially result in a global system collapse within the next
century. Resource scarcity is a widely recognized issue with implications for both the
environment and society, notably contributing to global climate change through factors
such as carbon emissions. The vulnerable approach to carbon resources has already
initiated this process. If these challenges persist, they could significantly impact economic
development and overall quality of life. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the
development of a balanced and cyclical system that integrates resources, carbon, and
socioeconomics – commonly known as sustainable development (see Figure 5a)38, 39.
Figure 5b 40 illustrates a life cycle example where the economy establishes infrastructure
for processing and creating products to support the social structure, utilizing initial
resources. Throughout the phases of product development—before, during, and after—
environmental impact occurs through emissions such as carbon, toxins, and waste.
Importantly, the generation of waste after product use and the methods employed for its
disposal are critical factors that significantly affect the environment.

Hence, adopting a comprehensive perspective, recognizing plastics as a critical waste
stream requiring focused attention for ongoing and future sustainable development, this
review seeks to examine the current state of global plastic waste management for both
bio-based and fossil-based plastics. In pursuit of these objectives, we intend to address
key questions aimed at uncovering critical issues, as outlined below:
(1) How is the current situation regarding the global fate of plastic waste?
(2) Is the current scenario conducive to the sustainable growth of the plastics
industry?
(3) If not, then what are the possible reasons behind lack of sustainable growth of the
plastic industries?
(4) What can be the possible solutions to achieve sustainable growth goals of plastic
industries?

Based upon the answers, the future prospects to achieve the sustainable development
growth in the plastic industry would be briefed. In this perspective paper, we consider
the plastic waste management sector as an integral part of the plastic industry,
encompassing both manufacturers and recyclers.

RESULTS and DISCUSSIONS
How is the current situation regarding the global fate of plastic waste?
Figure 6 presents global trends in plastic waste management spanning from 1980 to 2050.
Notably, the overall proportion of discarded all-plastic waste is projected to substantially
decrease from 100% to 6% by 2050. Concurrently, there are anticipated increases in
incineration and recycling, reaching around 50% and 44%, respectively. It is essential to
clarify that in Figure 6, "all waste" encompasses both bioplastics and fossil-plastics.
Despite the lower production of bioplastics compared to fossilplastics (as depicted in
Figure 1), the sub-figure in Figure 6 reveals that as of 2019, bio-plastic waste has not been
generated. Additionally, it is crucial to note that about 41% of total bioplastics production
(Figure 3) is non-biodegradable. However, the current plastic waste stream minimally
includes biodegradable bioplastics, suggesting their limited impact on plastic waste
management.

Is the current scenario conducive to the sustainable growth of the plastics industry?
The response to our second question suggests a significant lag in the plastics industry
aligning with sustainable development. Critical insights from Figure 6 reveal that, in
2019, approximately 49.4% of generated plastic waste was discarded, a proportion
expected to decrease to 6% by 2050. However, in 2019, an alarming 44.5% of the
discarded waste ended up in landfills, leaving the remaining 55.5% mismanaged, as
illustrated in Figure 7. With global societal and industrial expansion, landfill space is

If not, then what are the possible reasons behind lack of sustainable growth of the
plastic industries?
As reported in Figure 7, the primary reason for plastic disposal is the convenience of
single-use applications, with a substantial portion being casually discarded by individuals.
These applications, characterized by a short lifespan (less than 1 to 5 months) and low
pricing, especially for packaging foods and daily necessities, contribute to the problem,
as depicted in Figure 8.

Waste plastic from packaging, often made from thin films of PE and PP, is considered
low quality, likely due to its design. The term "low quality" refers to the low value these
PE and PP packaging wastes offer to recyclers. Despite the large volume of such waste,
material recovery rates are low, even after significant effort. As a result, consumers tend
to discard it, and recyclers are reluctant to collect it47. However, PE and PP used in other
sectors—such as automotive or household—are more likely to be recycled due to their
higher-quality waste, which adds more value for recyclers. This suggests that the problem
lies not in the plastic itself but in the design of its applications. The concept of product

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-t9r77-v3 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8511-642X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

design here refers to creating high-quality products, even if it leads to higher prices. This
encourages consumers to retain waste products and hand them over to designated
recyclers in exchange for compensation. When recyclers collect such high-quality waste,
they can efficiently recycle it into reusable plastic materials and applications48, 49.
However, the transforming PE and PP waste into monomers is only emerging but not yet
feasible with current technologies, as this is in practicing in case of PET into reusable
PET materials or monomers. This make PET is recycling favourable than PP, PE or PS50,
51

. Beyond this, another factor which decline recycling is the highly complex composite

products, which complicates the recovery of individual plastic types. Recycling is more
efficient for singular plastic waste than for composite waste. For instance, recovered
plastics from electronic and electrical waste, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) or wire
harnesses, consist of multiple plastic types, making them difficult to recycle and often
leading to incineration52, 53. One of the key challenges in plastic waste management is that
the profitability of recycling often falls short of the required investment in recycling
facilities, leading to unsustainable practices such as discarding or incinerating waste54.
Several major issues complicate recycling, including inefficient waste collection, high
levels of contamination, and limited potential for decontaminating materials. These
factors reduce both the technical and economic feasibility of recycling. The persistent
problem of sorting further restricts the recycling potential of plastics in municipal waste,
frequently resulting in their disposal or incineration, with or without energy recovery. For
recycling to be effective, the purity of recycled plastics typically must exceed 99% to be
used as a substitute for virgin materials. Another significant barrier is the relatively low
market demand for recycled materials due to differences in properties compared to virgin
plastics47, 49. For better results, the recycling sector should be an integral part of plastic

manufacturing. Therefore, economic and technological collaborative efforts for recycling
by plastic manufacturers, which may currently be insufficient.

What can be the possible technological solutions to achieve sustainable growth goals
of plastic industries?
As discarding waste plastic is deemed inappropriate, the next viable option involves
establishing circular systems for resources, carbon, and products. Fossil-based plastics
derive from molecular units or monomers sourced from fossil resources, while bio-based
plastics originate from molecular units or monomers derived from crude biomass. A
circular approach for waste plastics involves adopting a product-to-product strategy, such
as bottle-to-bottle, known as reuse. Reuse is considered the most suitable method for
mitigating carbon emissions. While achieving a universal product-to-product approach
may be challenging, reaching a rate of 20% or more could meet the World Economic
Forum's 2023 target. Although, reuse can be accelerated if the certain technological
factors such re-pair, re-fine, and re-design would be adopted in manufacturing of
products. Subsequently, the focus shifts to recycling, encompassing the conversion of
products back into plastics (e.g., PET bottle-to-PET) or transforming them into monomers
or fossil resources. Chemical recycling, which involves recovering chemicals like
monomers51, 55-57 for reproducing similar virgin plastics or crude fossil resources for
regenerating new plastics or repurposing chemicals as feedstocks58, 59, and mechanical
recycling, where plastic waste undergoes physical alterations for reuse 48, 49, 60, 61
facilitating the circulation of resources. These approaches are applicable to both fossiland bio-based plastics. Achieving sustainable development growth necessitates a critical

and swift expansion of waste plastic recycling. Unfortunately, as depicted in Figure 6,
only about 25% of all waste plastic was recycled by 2023 by in terms of materials
recovery, monomers recovery, other feedstocks recovery. Although there is ongoing
research on how to apply upcycling of waste plastics (i.e., turning the waste plastic into
new higher value plastics)50 to improve the recycling rates, as depicted in Figure 9.

However, evidence shows that low-quality waste plastics generated from packaging
sector often resulting in it being discarded or incinerated, as illustrated in Figures 6 and
7. To tackle this issue, maintaining high-quality waste plastic requires a collaborative
effort between manufacturers, consumers, and recyclers. Manufacturers can innovate
through improved product designs and material re-shuffle, consumers can ensure proper

disposal practices, and recyclers can adopt advanced collection, sorting, and recycling
techniques40. Of these groups, manufacturers play a critical role. They can enhance the
design of products and shift to using plastic, which is more easily recycled (e.g.,
packaging PP, PE, or PS can be replace by all PET packaging). Also, for manufactures
logo and other product information on the package, the PET film should be only used, as
depicted in Figure 10. If implemented, waste PET can be recycled into PET plastics or
monomers, unlike PP and PE, for which monomer recovery is not feasible. Although
recycling options exist for these materials, the costs associated with collection, separation,
decontamination, and recovery of recycled PE, PP, PET, or PS often exceed the value of
the recycled materials, as previously mentioned.

Last but least favourable, if some waste plastics are unsuitable for recycling for
appropriate reasons such as waste originate form hospitals which is likely unhygienic for
manual handling, repurposing as energy through thermal processing methods like
incineration is an alternative62-64. The energy generated can vary depending on its use for
electricity generation, combined heat and electricity, or as a solid waste fuel in blast
furnaces and cement kilns65, 66. Predictions indicate an increase in incineration, reaching
up to 50% by 2050, a trajectory misaligned with sustainable development goals as
incineration does not contribute to the net-zero carbon aim under SDGs due to its
unsuitability for carbon capture utilization (CCU) and carbon capture storage (CCS). In
all, reuse, and recycling is a more favorable option. Implementing CCU and CCS could
aid in developing carbon-neutral processes. As aforementioned, plastics such PVC loaded
with various additives, so, choosing methods must consider in recycling. Considering all,

BRIEFING AND FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENTS
Considering bioplastics as a practical alternative to fossil-based plastics appears more like
an aspiration than an imminent reality67, 68. This is evident from the historical and current
growth of the bioplastics industry, which has been significantly slower, constituting only
a about 1% share in overall plastic production compared to the rapid expansion of fossilbased plastics, as shown in Figure 1. It is unlikely that bioplastics will replace fossil-based
plastics in the next 27 years, extending up to 2050. Even with an increasing proportion of
bioplastics in total plastic production, assuming they could contribute to sustainable
development without the need for recycling or reusing products may not be feasible69.
This is primarily due to the fact that approximately 41% of bioplastics are currently not
biodegradable, as indicated in Figure 3. Therefore, these products must undergo recycling
for subsequent reuse70. Achieving sustainable development necessitates a re-evaluation
of fossil-based plastics product development and waste management strategies as
suggested aforementioned; because in 2023, only 25% of plastic waste is recycled, while
31.2% is incinerated and 43.8% goes to landfills or is improperly disposed of. By 2050,
recycling could rise to 44%, but incineration may still reach nearly 50%. Also, there is a
pressing need for innovative approaches to promote the reuse and recycling of products40.
The persistent failure to establish closed carbon loops contributes to the ongoing depletion
of non-renewable resources, leading to significant environmental carbon leakage into soil,
water, and air. This poses a severe threat to human habitats and biodiversity71-74. Without
addressing this issue, the current global waste management system is anticipated to face
a collapse in the midst of the 21st century, driven by current practices of landfilling and
inadequate management of plastic waste, exacerbating climate-related challenges.

Nevertheless, this is a perspective paper comprehensively examines the historical,
current, and prospective landscape of plastics production and waste management.
Ongoing studies in recycling have yielded various advanced technologies supported by
thorough documentation and evidence. Consequently, the subsequent papers would take
a more focused approach by delving into past, present, and future research on
technologies for plastic waste management, aiming to establish closed carbon loops in
the evolution of circular plastic development.

Appendix1. Model Description (a growth rate-based model) for
forecasting the global plastics production trend based upon the
historical data:
The forecasting model employed in this analysis is a basic exponential growth model. It
is designed to project future plastic production based on historical growth trends. The
core idea is to extend the observed growth rate into the future, if the historical growth
pattern will persist. Percentage Change Calculation: The model calculates the annual
percentage change using:
P = (Yc-YP)/YP
Where, P, Yc, and Yp are the Percentage change, current Year Value, and Previous Year
value.

Then Average Growth Rate is estimated. The mean of these annual percentage changes is
computed to determine the average growth rate. This growth rate is used to project future
values. Once you have the percentage changes for each year, compute the average of these
percentage changes to get the Average Growth Rate. This is done using:
G = ∑(P)/N
Where, G, and N are Average Growth Rate, and Number of Change.
Next is Forecasting, where Exponential Growth Formula is adopted. Future values are
projected using the exponential growth formula:
Forecasted Value = (Last Known Value) × (1+Average Growth rate)(Year-Last known Year)

The Confidence Intervals is estimated using standard deviation of historical percentage
changes (residuals) is used to measure variability. This helps estimate how much the
forecasted values might vary from the actual future values. This is done using:
Upper Bound = Forecasted Value × (1+1.96 × Residual Standard Deviation)
Lower Bound=Forecasted Value × (1+1.96 × Residual Standard Deviation
The factor 1.96 is used to represent a 95% confidence level, meaning there is a 95%
chance that the actual future values will fall within this range.

Appendix2. Model Description for forecasting the global waste plastic
management trend based upon the historical data:
For this forecasting, ARIMA model was adopted based upon the suitability of historical
data and forecasting more accurate results. In this forecasting, we realized that
considering growth rate is not suitable based upon waste management historical data as
we chose plastic production forecasting. Thus, we chose ARIMA to generate forecasting
with fine-tune. The ARIMA model leverages historical time series data to make
predictions about future values. The mathematical components involve autoregressive
terms, differencing for stationarity, and moving average terms, all optimized based on
AIC and BIC. Forecasts are generated using these optimized models, with confidence
intervals providing a range of uncertainty around the predictions.
The ARIMA model is a combination of three components:
1. AutoRegressive (AR) Component
2. Integrated (I) Component
3. Moving Average (MA) Component
1. AutoRegressive (AR) Component
The AR component models the current value of the time series as a function of its previous
values. It is characterized by the parameter p, which represents the number of lagged
values used in the model.
The AR(p) model can be expressed as:
Xt = ϕ1Xt−1 + ϕ2Xt−2+…+ ϕpXt−p + ϵt

where:
•
•
•

Xt is the value at time t.
ϕ1, ϕ2,…,ϕp are the AR coefficients.
ϵt is the white noise error term.

2. Integrated (I) Component
The I component involves differencing the time series to make it stationary (i.e., constant
mean and variance over time). The parameter d represents the number of times
differencing is applied.

If the original series Xt is not stationary, differencing is applied:
ΔdXt = (1−B)dXt

where Δ is the differencing operator and B is the backshift operator (BXt = Xt-1).

3. Moving Average (MA) Component
The MA component models the current value of the time series as a function of past error
terms. It is characterized by the parameter q, which represents the number of lagged
forecast errors included in the model.
The MA (q) model can be expressed as:
Xt = μ + ϵt + θ1ϵt−1 + θ2ϵt−2 +…+ θqϵt−q
where:

•

μ is the mean of the series.

•

θ1, θ2,…,,θq are the MA coefficients.

•

ϵt is the white noise error term.

ARIMA Model
The ARIMA model combines these components and is denoted as ARIMA (p, d, q):
ARIMA (p,d,q) : (1− ϕ1B − ϕ2B2−…−ϕpBp) ΔdXt = (1 + θ1B + θ2B2+…+ θqBq)ϵt

Model Fitting and Evaluation
1. Fitting the Model:
o

The model is fit to the historical data using Maximum.

Model Evaluation:
2. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
AIC = −2log(L) + 2k

where L is the likelihood of the model, and k is the number of parameters. Lower AIC
values indicate a better model fit.
3. BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion):
BIC = −2log(L) + klog(n)

where n is the number of observations. BIC penalizes more for the number of parameters
compared to AIC.
