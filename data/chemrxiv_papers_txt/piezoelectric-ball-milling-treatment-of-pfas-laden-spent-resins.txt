Abstract

9

Anion exchange resins (AERs) have been widely used for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl

10

substances (PFAS) from water. However, regardless of whether AERs are regenerable or single-

11

use, the disposal of end-of-life AERs presents significant challenges. Conventional waste

12

management strategies, such as landfill disposal and incineration, are increasingly under scrutiny

13

and may face impending bans due to environmental concerns. This study introduces a non-thermal,

14

solvent-free process for the effective destruction of PFAS on AERs by co-milling piezoelectric

15

boron nitride (BN) powders with contaminated AERs and stainless steel (SS) balls. The approach

16

demonstrated the destruction of PFOS and achieved 80% defluorination when applied to two types

17

of AERs (PFA694E and AmberLite IRA 67) pre-loaded with PFOS. Comprehensive targeted PFAS

18

analysis and suspect screening analysis of transformation products elucidated the reaction

19

mechanisms and confirmed that the functional groups of AERs did not participate in the reaction.

20

The process’s effectiveness was further validated in treating field-collected single-use AERs

21

(PFA694 and AmberLite PSR2 Plus) contaminated with PFAS mixtures of varying chain lengths

22

and head groups. After treatment, PFAS levels on the AERs were reduced to below ng/g detection

23

limits, and no PFAS release was observed in standard leaching tests.

Introduction

33

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chemical pollutants highly recalcitrant

34

to conventional water treatment processes. With the United States Environmental Protection

35

Agency (USEPA) enforcing stringent PFAS standards, PFAS adsorption has become widely

36

adopted in water treatment plants across the country. Anion exchange resins (AERs) are garnering

37

increasing attention for PFAS removal, as they show higher adsorption capacity and resistance to

38

natural organic matters (NOMs) than granular activated carbon (GAC).1,2

39

Regeneration of AERs requires salt brine amended with organic solvent.3 The resulting

40

regenerant, also known as still bottoms, from this process poses significant disposal challenges.

41

The reported treatment strategies for the destruction of PFAS in still bottoms include

42

electrochemical oxidation, UV/sulfite reduction, sonolysis, and plasma treatment.4–8 However,

43

each method has its limitation: electrochemical oxidation of still bottom with high chloride

44

concentrations can lead to the formation of halogenated byproducts, UV/sulfite reduction can be

45

hindered by NOMs, sonolysis requires high energy input with sluggish PFAS degradation kinetics,

46

and plasma treatment is less efficient for the removal of short-chain PFAS. It remains uncertain

47

under what conditions the cost of regeneration, including the treatment of PFAS-laden still bottom

48

solutions, can be justified by the savings achieved through the repetitive reuse of the AERs. For

49

example, the USEPA concluded that the regeneration practice is less feasible at the full scale for

50

drinking water facilities.9 More importantly, the loss of adsorption capacity (i.e., faster

51

breakthrough) was observed after AER regeneration.10 Therefore, even regenerable AERs will

52

eventually need to be disposed of after repeated service cycles. Manufacturers have introduced

53

single-use AERs targeted specifically for PFAS. Some single-use AERs were found to outperform

54

regenerable AERs.11 However, the question remains: how should the spent single-use AERs be

55

disposed of after service?

56

Landfilling and incineration are two interim options for managing spent sorbents.9 Landfilling

57

without PFAS destruction merely postpones PFAS discharge until they migrate into the leachate.

58

Incineration of PFAS-laden sorbents may emit greenhouse gas, hydrogen fluoride, and the product

59

of incomplete combustion.12 Though the thermal treatment of PFAS-laden GAC has been

60

extensively summarized,13,14 studies specifically on the thermal treatment of PFAS-laden AERs

61

are relatively scarce. A recent study proved the decomposition of AERs spiked with target PFAS

62

by inductive heating.15 However, the study did not close the fluorine balance, and fluorocarbon

63

byproduct formation was not investigated. There has been no full-scale study evaluating the

64

incineration of PFAS-laden AER.

65

This study provides a solvent-free and non-thermal option to treat PFAS-laden AERs at

66

ambient conditions. We report that the co-milling of PFAS-loaded AERs (prepared in the lab and

67

collected from the field) with piezoelectric boron nitride (BN) can readily destroy PFAS on AERs

68

to fluoride (F-). Targeted analysis and suspect screening of transformation products were used to

69

elucidate the reaction mechanisms. Leaching tests on treated AERs were conducted, confirming

70

that PFAS release is not a concern if the milled resins are exposed to rainfall or snow melt.

Materials and Method.

73

Chemicals and AERs

74

All chemicals were used as received: Heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid potassium salt (PFOS,

75

Sigma-Aldrich), boron nitride (BN, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium chloride (NaCl, Sigma-Aldrich),

76

methanol (MeOH, Sigma-Aldrich), PFA694E single-use AERs (Purofine), and AmberLite IRA67

77

regenerable AERs (DuPont). The desired amounts of PFOS were loaded on AERs through

78

adsorption (details see Text S1) to prepare model AERs for treatment and mechanism study. Two

79

types of PFAS-containing spent single-use AERs, PFA694 and AmberLite PSR2 Plus, derived

80

from PFAS site remediation projects, were provided by WSP and Haley & Aldrich, respectively.

81

Ball Milling Treatment

82

AERs (0.28 g) and BN (0.5–1 g) were added into a 100 mL stainless steel (SS) jar containing 160

83

g of SS balls (fifteen 10 mm balls and one hundred and ten 5 mm balls). The jar was sealed with a

84

lid and placed on a planetary ball mill (Across International, PQ-N04), which was then rotated at

85

a jar speed of 580 rpm.

86

Extraction and Analysis of PFAS

87

The PFOS loads on the model AERs, both before and after the ball milling treatment, were verified

88

through solvent extraction. The selection and optimization of the extraction solvent are detailed in

89

a subsequent section. For the AERs without subjecting to ball milling, solvent extraction of AER

90

beads was conducted in a centrifuge tube mounted on a shaker rotating at 60 rpm for 24 hours. For

91

AERs subjected to the ball milling treatment, the solvent was added directly to the ball milling jars

92

to extract residual PFAS from the AERs, milling balls, and jar walls. The jars were then subjected

93

to the same 24-hour extraction process. The extraction of the PFAS mixture from the field-

94

collected spent AERs follows the same protocol. PFAS analysis was conducted by ultra-high-

95

performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC, Thermo Vanquish) integrated with a triple

96

quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS, Thermo Altis). Suspect screening of transformation

97

products was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole

98

time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QToF-MS, SCIEX). Details of instrument setup and data

99

acquisition can be found in Text S2 and S3. Procedures for the extraction of F- by 0.1 M NaOH

100

and analysis by ion chromatography (IC; Dionex) were described in Text S4.

102

Results and Discussion

103

Extraction of PFAS and F-

104

It is important to emphasize that the ball milling treatment is a non-solvent process, where dry

105

AERs were co-milled with BN without the use of solvents. However, to assess the efficiency of

106

PFAS destruction, samples were extracted with solvents both before and after treatment, and the

107

PFAS content in the extract was analyzed. For regenerable AER, the extraction process aligns with

108

the principles of regeneration, using solvents to desorb PFAS.16 Extracting PFAS from single-use

109

AERs poses a greater challenge due to its high affinity for long-chain PFAS, but it is still

110

achievable.15

111

A combination of water, methanol, and NaCl has proven to be the most effective extraction

112

solvent.16–19 Based on this, we tested nine different solvents following a previously reported

113

method for extracting PFOS from PFA694E single-use AERs preloaded with a known quantity of

114

PFOS (Figure S1a). The results show that the mixture of 80% methanol and 3% NaCl was the most

115

effective, recovering 80% of the spiked PFOS. Milling AERs with SS balls without BN for one

116

hour did not result in PFOS destruction but did increase the amount of PFOS extractable from the

117

pulverized AERs to 97% (Figure S1a). This increase is likely because the milling process broke

118

down the porous structure of the AERs, allowing improved contact between the AERs and solvent,

119

which facilitated the extraction of PFAS. This ‘pre-milling + extraction’ strategy was also used to

120

measure the PFOS sobbed on IRA 67 AERs (Figure S1b) and the PFAS mixture sorbed on the

121

field-collected resin (Figure S2) in subsequent experiments.

122

Fluoride, as the degradation end product, was extracted using either 6% NaCl or 0.1 M NaOH,

123

based on recommendations from previous studies focused on regenerating AERs after F⁻

124

adsorption.20,21 The results of extraction of a known amount of F- spiked on AERs are shown in

125

Figure S1c. 0.1 M NaOH demonstrated superior performance over 6% NaCl, achieving a 90% F-

126

extraction efficiency. These results also suggest that if PFAS are fully mineralized to F⁻, which is

127

subsequently immobilized by AERs, approximately 90% should be found in the extract solution.

128

The limitation in F⁻ recovery prevents the fluorine balance from being fully closed (see discussion

129

below). However, it is important to note that achieving 100% F⁻ recovery from AERs is rarely

130

possible, as has been shown previously.20,21 Because the F- extraction efficiency is controlled by

131

the concentration equilibrium between F- and competing ions. Additionally, AERs have a higher

132

affinity to F- than to Cl- and OH- in the extract solvent.22

133
134

Treatment of Model AERs Spiked with PFOS

135

AERs spiked in the lab with PFAS were pulverized by milling with stainless steel (SS) balls

136

without BN for one hour and extracted to yield time-zero PFOS concentrations (Figure 1). Control

137

tests were conducted by further milling the pulverized AERs for an additional eight hours in the

138

absence of BN. The key finding from these tests is that ball milling alone, without the aid of BN,

139

could not destroy PFOS.

140

To initiate PFAS destruction, BN powders were added following one hour of pulverization. In

141

the presence of BN, upon ball collision, the piezoelectric BN can generate kV-level potentials for

142

the destruction of PFAS chemicals, as detailed extensively in our recent studies.23,24 Measurable

143

destruction of PFOS adsorbed on AERs was observed after the addition of BN, with degradation

144

kinetics accelerating with the increased BN loading on PFA694E AERs (Figure 1a). Co-milling of

145

750 mg BN with 280 mg AERs (BN/AER mass ratio of 2.7) resulted in near-complete destruction

146

of PFOS after three hours of treatment. The faster PFOS degradation kinetics at higher BN doses

147

can be attributed to the enhanced contact between BN and the AERs. This is further supported by

148

scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, which shows a well-mixed homogenized mixture

149

of BN and AER debris after milling (Figure S3).

150

The treatment of PFOS on AERs was compared with the destruction of PFOS in solid form at

151

equivalent amounts to determine the role of the resin in PFOS destruction (Figure 1b). As expected,

152

the PFOS embedded in AERs exhibited slower degradation kinetics, suggesting that the AERs act

153

as an inert matrix and shield the impact force exerted on BN, thereby attenuating the piezoelectric

154

potential. The impact force can be increased by an increase of ball to powder mass ratio (B/P ratio,

155

where the powder includes BN particles and AERs). As a result, the PFOS degradation kinetics

156

are accelerated at a higher B/P ratio (Figure S4). By optimizing the BN-to-AER ratio, near-

157

complete destruction of PFOS on regenerable IRA 67 AERs was achieved (Figure 1c).

at mass ratios specified in the figure legend, using a jar rotation speed of 580 rpm. For Figure 1b,

165

two conditions were tested: (i) 280 mg PFA694E loaded with 0.6 mg PFOS was milled with 750

166

mg BN, and (ii) 0.6 mg PFOS (added as a methanol stock solution and evaporated methanol at

room temperature) was milled with 750 mg BN. Error bars represent the standard deviation of

triplicate results.

During the ball milling treatment, the formation of shorter-chain perfluorinated carboxylate

171

acids (PFCAs) was observed both when PFOS was adsorbed onto the AERs and when it was

172

treated as a standalone solid (Figure S5). The formation of PFCAs indicates a –CF2– elimination

173

mechanism initiated by the cleavage of the sulfonate group (Route 1 in reaction pathways

174

illustrated in Figure S7). This oxidative pathway has been widely reported in electrochemical

175

oxidation processes.25,26 It aligns with the nature of BN-assisted ball milling, which relies on high

176

piezoelectric potential to oxidize PFAS.23

177

An HPLC-QToF-HRMS was used to identify suspect transformation products (TPs) not

178

captured by the targeted UPLC-MS/MS analysis. As revealed in our recent study, ball collisions

179

can impart boron nitride (BN) with both positive and negative charges, with the negative charge

180

facilitating reductive destruction mechanisms.23 It is also critical to note that H2O, present in the

181

feedstock and air, can be split into hydrogen atoms (•H) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) under high

182

potentials,27,28 such as piezoelectric potentials generated in our ball milling system. The generation

183

of free electrons and the subsequent formation of hydrogen atoms (•H) leads to the formation of

184

six 1H-perfluoroalkanes TPs (CnF2n+1H; n = 3-8; Figure S6). These TPs may originate from the

185

cleavage of C-S or C-C bonds followed by the adduct of •H, as depicted in route 2 in Figure S7.

186

The reductive destruction following the H/F exchange (route 3 in Figure S7) may also occur on

187

the side-chain C-F bonds without breaking the sulfonate head groups. This potential reaction is

188

supported by the detection of two H/F exchange TPs, C8F16HSO3- and C8F15H2SO3- (Figure S6).

189

The H/F exchange is suspected to take place at the beta-carbon position due to the lower C-F bond

190

energy at this site.29 The cleavage of the C-F side chain may also be followed by the attack of •OH,

191

representing a combination of reduction and oxidation pathways (shown as route 4 in Figure S7).

192

This process explains the formation of the OH/F exchange product (C8F16HSO4-) and the

193

associated ketonic structure (C8F15SO4-) after HF elimination (Figure S6).

194

We found no evidence that the presence of AERs contributed to new reaction pathways or

195

generated new TPs. For instance, we did not observe the formation of Cl⁻ or nitrogen-containing

196

TPs, which could have resulted from the quaternary ammonium groups or the preloaded Cl⁻ in the

197

strong-base AER.

198

Comparing the TP profiles observed during BN-assisted ball milling of PFOS loaded on AERs

199

with those from solid PFOS treatment, we found that the presence of AERs produced the same TPs

200

but in lower quantities (Figure S8). Although we could not quantify the TPs due to the lack of

201

chemical standards, it is important to note that all TPs were eliminated with extended ball milling

202

treatment. No peak intensities exceeding 100 were observed after 4 hours of treatment.

203

After 24 h of milling, 80% of the fluorine on PFOS loaded on the AERs was recovered as F-

204

(Figure S9). The gap in the fluorine balance may be attributed to the difficulty of completely

205

extracting F⁻ from the AERs (Figure S1c).

206
207

Treatment of Field Exposed Spent AERs

208

We applied the BN-assisted ball milling approach in the treatment of field-exposed spent AERs.

209

The milling treatment was performed at a BN-to-AER mass ratio of 2.7:1 (Figure 2). The AERs

210

before and after treatment were extracted by a mixing solution of 80% MeOH and 3% NaCl for

211

24 hours (Figure S2), followed by the analysis of thirty target PFAS by UPLC-MS/MS. The

212

extracts from the two AERs, sourced from different groundwater remediation projects, exhibited

213

diverse PFAS profiles, covering C4-C8 PFSAs and PFCAs. The BN-assisted ball milling treatment

214

effectively eliminated all target PFAS below the detection limits (Table S1), irrespective of their

215

chemical structures, after 24 h of milling.

222

To address the concern about the leaching of PFAS residuals from AERs after ball milling, we

223

performed leaching tests following EPA method SW-846 1312 (method description in Text S5).

224

The treated AERs (without extraction by organic solvents) were immersed in pH 4.2 deionized

225

water to simulate acid rainfall or snow melt. The water-to-solid mass ratio was 20:1 in compliant

226

with the standard method. After 20 h of leaching tests, thirty target PFAS were all found below the

227

detection limits in the leaching solution (Table S2).

228
229

Environmental Implications

230

This study presents a novel, non-thermal, solvent-free approach for treating PFAS in AERs. The

231

method involves a simple setup that co-mills AERs with BN and SS balls. BN is a widely available

232

industrial material. Given the economic considerations, we do not expect the recovery and reuse

233

of low-cost BN ($30-50/kg from Alibaba.com) to be beneficial. Therefore, the BN will be blended

234

with the treated AERs after treatment. During the PFAS degradation process, BN is expected to

235

decompose into ammonium and borate.23 Even if residual BN particles remain, they are known to

236

be biocompatible and non-cytotoxic.30

237

Ball mills, as mature industrial equipment, can be repurposed as effective treatment units.

238

However, a significant gap exists in developing models and methodologies to translate lab-scale

239

results obtained from planetary ball mills to larger-scale mills, such as tumbler mills. This

240

challenge is currently under investigation. Nonetheless, our previous theoretical analysis indicates

241

that the ball impact velocity in planetary ball milling, measured at 1.5 m/s,23 is in the same order

242

of magnitude as the value generated by tumbler mills.31 Additionally, a peer study has

243

demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up PFAS-contaminated soil treatment using a tumbler mill,

244

though their approach differs by employing KOH as the co-milling reagent.32 Therefore, scaling

245

up the treatment of AERs using BN-assisted ball milling presents a promising avenue approach.

246

Lastly, it is important to emphasize that this technology is specifically designed for the disposal

247

of single-use and end-of-life regenerable AERs, not for regeneration. The ball mill treatment unit

248

can be constructed as a modular, trailer-based platform. This onsite, non-thermal PFAS elimination

249

process allows the PFAS-free milled AERs to be further disposed of as non-hazardous material

250

through landfilling, ensuring regulatory compliance.
