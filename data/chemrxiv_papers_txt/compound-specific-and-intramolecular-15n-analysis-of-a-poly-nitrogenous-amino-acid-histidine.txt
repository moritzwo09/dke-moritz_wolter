Abstract
Histidine (HIS) is an essential amino acid (AA) with key physiological roles in metal chelation
and proton buffering. Its three nitrogen (N) atoms—one α-amino and two in the imidazole side
chain—are incorporated through distinct biosynthetic pathways and undergo different catabolic
processes. Thus, its intramolecular δ15N likely provides additional information on these pathways
and associated N fluxes. Very few studies have reported molecular average δ15NHIS (δ15NHIS-Total)
and there are no reported intramolecular δ15NHIS data for natural materials due to the technical
limitations of available methods. Here, we present a novel analytical approach for compoundspecific and intramolecular δ15N of poly-nitrogenous AAs using HIS as an example, such
analytical scheme can be adapted to obtain position-specific δ15N of other key AAs with two N
atoms such as glutamine. Underivatized HIS is separated by ion-exchange chromatography (IC)
and divided into two aliquots. One fraction is fully oxidized to NO₃⁻ using UV-persulfate oxidation
for δ15NHIS-Total measurement, while the other undergoes NaClO oxidation, selectively converting
α-N and a minor fraction of sidechain-N to NO₂⁻ at a known ratio. δ15NHIS of α-N (δ15NHIS-α) and
sidechain-N (δ15NHIS-s) are then calculated from these two results. Our findings reveal that α-N is
consistently enriched in ¹⁵N relative to sidechain-N in both commercial HIS powder (Δδ15Nα-s = ~
+ 8‰) and biological samples (Δδ15Nα-s = ~ + 3 to 25‰), likely due to preferential α-N catabolism
via deamination. This finding supports the potential of studying diverse biosynthetic and catabolic
processes of poly-nitrogenous AAs using intramolecular δ15N.
1. Introduction
Nitrogen (N) isotopic composition (δ15N) of amino acids (AAs) has been widely applied to study
N assimilation, biosynthesis, and metabolism, as well as trophic dynamics in ecosystems1-6. The
interpretative power of this tool stems from the N isotopic fractionation induced by biochemical
reactions involving the breakage or formation of C-N bonds, mostly driven by transamination and
deamination of the α-N7, 8. However, the intramolecular 15N distribution within poly-nitrogenous
AAs, where sidechain N atoms may experience different biochemical reactions compared to the
α-N, remains largely unexplored.
Histidine (HIS) is a structurally unique essential amino acid containing three nitrogen atoms—one
α-N and two in the imidazole sidechain. Beyond its role in protein synthesis, HIS functions as a
proton buffer, a metal ion chelator, and a catalytic site in metalloenzymes9-12. It also serves as a
precursor to biologically important compounds such as urocanic acid, carnosine, and N-acetylhistidine, which are critical for vertebrate growth and metabolism13 14, 15. HIS δ15N values (δ15NHIS)
could thus be a useful tool to study the biosynthesis and metabolism of HIS and the factors
regulating these processes.

During HIS biosynthesis in primary producers, the α-N is derived from glutamic acid via
transamination, while the imidazole N atoms originate from glutamine and ATP16,
17
(Supplementary Figure 1a). Unlike AAs such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, valine, alanine,
leucine, and isoleucine, which readily exchange N with each other and with cellular ammonia—
collectively termed the “metabolic N pool”18—HIS does not undergo significant N exchange in
vivo, as demonstrated by isotope-labeling experiments19, 20. As a result, the molecular average δ15N
value of HIS (δ15NHIS-Total) may be decoupled from the isotopic composition of AAs that participate
extensively in transamination, such as glutamic acid (Glu), which is typically significantly
enriched in 15N due to its role in N metabolism 18. This distinction is evident in marine organisms
and human hair, where δ15NHIS-Total is consistently lower than δ15N of Glu by more than 10‰21-24.
During the synthesis of non-essential AAs, transamination progressively increases 15N enrichment
in the metabolic N pool, a trend that becomes more pronounced at higher trophic levels. However,
since HIS does not interact significantly with this pool, its δ15N does not increase substantially
with trophic transfer. Given the high biosynthetic cost of HIS (~41 ATP)16, 25, organisms may
preferentially incorporate dietary HIS rather than degrade it, potentially preserving the original
δ15N signature of the dietary HIS26. Consequently, δ15NHIS-Total may serve as an indicator of the
δ15N composition of the basal N source within an ecosystem18.
In addition to δ15NHIS-Total, intramolecular δ15NHIS could provide insight into biosynthetic pathways
and corresponding isotope fractionation that each N atom experiences. The α-N can be catabolized
via irreversible deamination by histidine ammonia-lyase (Supplementary Figure 1b), whereas
complete degradation pathways for the imidazole ring are absent in many lower eukaryotes and
plants27, 28. Compared to the sidechain-N atoms, the α-N atom is more likely subjected to HIS
catabolism that irreversibly cleaves the C-N bond and thus induces isotopic fractionation to the αN atom (δ15NHIS-α). Thus, the two N atoms in the imidazole ring might preserve the original isotopic
composition of HIS imprinted from the biosynthesis by primary producers with minimal alteration.
As a result, the δ¹⁵N of sidechain N (δ15NHIS-s) may retain the original biosynthetic isotope signals,
while δ15NHIS-α may reflect the isotopic fractionation through deamination, which is not directly
related to the 15N enrichment in the metabolic N pool caused by transamination. These differences
could provide insights into physiological and nutritional status, independent of trophic
fractionation effects.
Despite its potential, δ15NHIS measurements have been limited by analytical challenges. Traditional
δ15NHIS analysis using gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(GC/C/IRMS) requires derivatization. Common HIS derivatives exhibit low recovery, long
retention times, and frequent coelution with other AAs20, 29-34. The imidazole group may lead to
incomplete reactions and formation of N-containing side products that are lost during preparation,
as the common derivative reagents also react with the imidazole-N35, 36. The only reported attempt
to measure intramolecular δ15NHIS was by Sacks and Brenna37, who enzymatically cleaved the αN and analyzed the δ¹⁵N of HIS and the cleaved product via GC/C/IRMS, but no intramolecular
δ15NHIS data for natural materials exist in the literature.
Offline AA purification using liquid chromatography coupled with elemental analyzer-IRMS (EAIRMS) provides an alternative method by eliminating the need for derivatization. In this approach,
underivatized AAs are separated via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), collected
in fractions, and analyzed for δ15N using EA-IRMS38. However, EA-IRMS requires significantly
larger sample sizes (>3 µmol N per AA) compared to GC/C/IRMS (>5 nmol N) to achieve
comparable analytical precision32, making it less suitable for samples with limited materials. While

nano-scale EA-IRMS (> ~ 35 – 50 nmol N) has been developed32, 39, it remains uncommon. To the
best of our knowledge, only one study has reported δ15NHIS data of natural samples analyzed using
this HPLC/EA-IRMS approach40.
To overcome these limitations, we present a novel analytical framework for compound-specific
and intramolecular δ15N-AA analysis for poly-nitrogenous AAs using HIS as an example.
Underivatized HIS is isolated and fraction-collected using ion-exchange chromatography (IC) and
separated into two aliquots. One fraction is fully oxidized to NO3⁻ using UV-persulfate oxidation
for δ15NHIS-Total determination, while the other undergoes NaClO oxidation, selectively converting
α-N and a portion of sidechain-N to NO2⁻ at a known ratio. The δ¹⁵N of NO3⁻ and NO2⁻ products
are then analyzed via IRMS to resolve δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s. We validate this method using seven
in-house HIS isotopic standards and five biological samples, assessing its accuracy and precision.
This approach provides a robust framework for studying both compound-specific and
intramolecular δ15N patterns in poly-nitrogenous AAs (position-specific δ15N for AAs with two N
atoms such as Glutamine, tryptophan, and lysine), enabling new insights into nitrogen metabolism
and biosynthetic pathways.
2. Experimental Section
2.1 Standard preparation
A working standard solution of histidine (HIS-0) was prepared from a commercial L-histidine
powder (VWR, PA, USA) without isotopic enrichment. To generate HIS calibration standards with
a wide range of δ15N values, HIS-0 was mixed gravimetrically with isotopically labeled L-histidine
monohydrochloride monohydrate standards (Cambridge Isotope, MA, USA) at known proportions.
The α-series (HIS-α1, α2, α3) was produced by mixing HIS-0 with a labeled L-histidine standard
enriched in 15N exclusively at the α-position (98% 15N), while the w-series (HIS-w1, w2, w3) was
prepared using an L-histidine standard uniformly labeled with 98% 15N at all N positions. The
molecular average δ15N of each standard (δ15NHIS-Total) was determined by elemental analyzerisotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) at the University of California Davis Stable Isotope
Facility. Additionally, a urocanic acid solution was prepared from a commercial powder (Acros,
USA) as a structural analog of the HIS imidazole sidechain. This urocanic acid standard was used
to evaluate the reactivity and isotopic behavior of sidechain N during subsequent oxidation steps
(discussed below).
To evaluate HIS separation from other AAs, seven standard AA mixtures were prepared by
combining each HIS isotopic standard (HIS-0, -α1, -α2, -α3, -w1, -w2, -w3) with L-alanine (Ala),
L-arginine (Arg), L-asparagine (Asn), D/L-aspartic acid (Asp), L-cysteine (Cys), L-glutamic acid
(Glu), L-glutamine (Gln), glycine (Gly), L-isoleucine (Ile), L-leucine (Leu), L-lysine (Lys), D/Lmethionine (Met), L-phenylalanine (Phe), D/L-serine (Ser), D/L-threonine (Thr), L-tyrosine (Tyr),
and D/L-valine (Val). The final AA concentrations were adjusted to 5 mM for HIS, Asp, Glu, Gln,
and Phe, and 2.5 mM for all other AAs.
2.2 Sample Preparation
To further validate the method for natural samples, a suite of materials was analyzed including: 1)
a cyanobacteria powder (Spirulina Pacifica) that has been used as a multi-lab quality control
standard for different CSIA-AA methods41, 42. 2) Copepod and euphausiid samples that were
collected from the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP; 14.02°N, 104.27°W) during the R/V Sally
Ride (SR2011, Scripps Institution of Oceanography) cruise from December 2020 to January 2021

. 3) particulate organic matter (POM) in the size fraction of 0.3 – 53 μm that was collected using
a pre-combusted glass fiber filter (GF-75, 0.3 µm pore size) during the same cruise at 35 m depth
using a McLane large-volume in-situ filtration system (WTS-LV; McLane Research Laboratories)
44
. 4) A muscle tissue sample from a striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) that was collected in Nueces
Bay, TX, in 2014. Sample collection details are provided in Supplementary Table ST1.

Extraction of AAs including HIS from natural samples followed previously established protocols
(Figure 1)41, 42, 45, 46. Briefly, 15–50 mg of dried biological samples or three-quarters of a GF-75
filter were hydrolyzed in 6N HCl at 110°C for 22 hours to release AAs from proteins. This sample
mass was chosen to ensure sufficient recovery of HIS, given its relatively low abundance in natural
materials. Following hydrolysis, lipids were extracted using n-hexane/dichloromethane (6:5, v/v)
and removed from the aqueous hydrolysates containing AAs. The samples were then completely
dried at 40°C under vacuum (RapidVap; Labconco) and redissolved in 0.05N HCl. Metal ions
were removed via cation-exchange chromatography following previously established protocols42,
47
. HIS and other AAs were eluted with 10% NH4OH, dried at 35°C under vacuum, and
reconstituted in 0.2–7 mL of Milli-Q water to achieve a target HIS concentration of 2–5 mM before
chromatographic separation.
2.3 Ion-Exchange Chromatography separation and collection
HIS was isolated from standard mixtures and natural samples using an ion-exchange
chromatography system (ICS 5000+; Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a CarboPac PA10
semi-preparative column (9 × 250 mm, 10 µm particle size, <10 Å pore size). An automated
fraction collector (AFC 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) received ~90% of the flow, while the rest
was directed to a pulse amperometric detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for peak detection.
Samples (25 µL of standard mixtures or natural extracts) were injected into the ion-exchange
chromatography (IC) system using a mobile phase consisting of (A) Milli-Q water, (B) 1M NaOH,
and (C) 1M NaOAc at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. The chromatographic method was optimized for
selective HIS separation and collection (Figure 2). An isocratic elution (70% A, 40% B) was
applied for the first 33 minutes to achieve effective separation of HIS from other AAs, followed
by a gradient elution (40% A, 10% B, 50% C) from 33 to 57 minutes to elute the remaining AAs.
The system was re-equilibrated with 70% A and 40% B for 20 minutes before the next injection
to ensure consistent performance.
HIS was collected into pre-combusted glass vials, and a procedural blank with an equivalent
collection window was included to account for potential isotopic interferences from potential coeluting nitrogenous compounds that could be oxidized to NO3⁻ or NO2⁻ during subsequent
chemical processing (Figure 2). To assess the reproducibility of the analytical procedure, HIS from
each standard mixture was analyzed in triplicate, while HIS from natural samples was analyzed in
at least duplicate. HIS concentrations in natural samples were quantified by calibration against a
series of standard mixtures. Collected fractions were split into two aliquots (20 – 60 nmol of HIS
in each aliquot) for oxidation (UV+POR or NaClO) (Figure 1).
2.4 UV+POR oxidation
For δ15NHIS-Total measurement, HIS was fully oxidized to NO₃⁻ using UV-persulfate oxidation
(POR) modified after Foreman et al.48. The persulfate reagent (0.185M) was prepared by
dissolving 1.25 g of recrystallized potassium persulfate (Fisher Chemical) and 0.4 g of NaOH
(semi-conductor grade, Honeywell, NC, USA) in 25 ml of Milli-Q water. Oxidation was performed

in pre-combusted quartz vials (PurQ, Momentive Technologies) containing 10–80 nmol of HIS/
urocanic acid standards or IC-collected fractions (~9.8 mL), with 175 µL of POR reagent added.
Samples were sealed with borosilicate stoppers and irradiated for 3 hours in a UV oxidation
chamber (7900, Ace Glass) equipped with a 1200-W mercury lamp (7825-40, Ace Glass), allowing
the complete conversion of organic N to NO3-. Reaction blanks (Milli-Q water) were processed
identically. The oxidation yields were verified by quantifying the NO3- produced using a nutrient
discrete analyzer (AQ300; Seal Analytical; US EPA Method 126-A), and oxidized samples were
stored at 4°C before isotope analysis.
2.5 NaClO oxidation
The α-N and a small portion of the side-N of HIS (as determined below) were oxidized to NO2using NaClO with previously established procedures42, 49. The catalytic reagent (0.665 g NaBr in
100 mL 10M NaOH) and oxidizing reagent (4.25 mL of 5.25% NaClO diluted to 100 mL) were
freshly prepared. Each reaction vial contained 50 nmol of HIS/ urocanic acid standard or ICcollected fractions (~ 3.5 – 10 ml), to which 0.1 mL of catalytic reagent and 0.1 mL of oxidizing
reagent were sequentially added. After incubation at 50°C for 30 minutes in a water bath, the
reaction was quenched with 0.2 ml of Na2AsO2 solution (5.1 g of Na2AsO2 in 100 ml of MilliQ
water). Triplicate NaClO reaction blanks (Milli-Q water) were processed under identical
conditions and included in each sample batch to account for potential background contributions
and ensure analytical accuracy. The concentration of the produced NO2- was determined using a
nutrient discrete analyzer (AQ300; Seal Analytical; US EPA Method 354.1).
2.6 Conversion to N2O and δ15N analysis
Reduction of NO3- or NO2- to N2O and the subsequent δ15N analysis was performed at University
of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMD). About 40 nmol of NO3- obtained from UV+POR oxidation
was reduced to N2O in serum vials by chemical conversion using Ti (III) following the procedures
described in Altabet et al.50. To calibrate the unknowns, triplicates of MilliQ water blanks,
USGS34, USGS35, and an in-house NO3- isotopic reference standard received the same treatment
as the samples. Around 10 – 12 nmol of NO2- in samples oxidized by NaClO, along with triplicates
of MilliQ water blanks and three in-house NO2- isotopic reference standards, were converted to
N2O by NaN3 in serum vials following previously established procedures42, 49, 51, 52.
δ15N analysis of N2O was conducted using a purge-and-trap continuous‐flow isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (PT/CF/IRMS; Isoprime Ltd) following the established procedures50. MilliQ water
blanks, and NO3- and NO2- isotopic reference standards were analyzed at the beginning and end of
each sample analysis sequence. The analytical precision of δ15N-N2O measurement is ± 0.06‰.
2.7 Data correction and calibration
Raw δ15N-N2O values were first corrected for blank contributions from the Ti (III) or NaN3
conversion and then calibrated against the isotopic reference standards following the protocol from
Altabet et al.50. Reaction blank correction was performed using an isotope mass balance equation
42, 51, 53
to obtain δ15N values for the UV + persulfate oxidation (δ15NUV + POR) and NaClO oxidation
(δ15NClO) of HIS samples:

standards directly oxidized by UV + POR or NaClO were corrected using the respective reaction
blanks, while IC procedural blanks were used to correct HIS fractions collected from IC
separations of both standard mixtures and natural samples.
To generate a calibration curve for δ15NUV+POR, values from pure HIS standards and IC-collected
HIS standards were plotted against their independently measured δ15N values (δ15NHIS-Total) from
EA-IRMS:
15

15

δ NUV+POR = m δ NHIS-Total + c

(2)

where m and c are the slope and y-intercept of the linear regression model. The δ15NUV+POR of
natural samples were then calibrated using equation (2) to yield δ15NHIS-Total.
To resolve the δ15N of α-N (δ15NHIS-α) and sidechain-N (δ15NHIS-s, representing the average δ15N
of two imidazole N atoms), the following equations were applied:
15

15

δ NHIS-Total = 3 δ NHis-α + 3 δ NHis-s

(4)

where εα and εs represent fractionation factors for NaClO oxidation at the α-N and side-N sites,
respectively. Literature values for NaClO oxidation of α-N and imino-N in other AAs range from
-2.4‰ to 3.3‰49. Based on previous studies, εα was assumed to be 0.6‰, corresponding to the
fractionation factor for IC-purified phenylalanine (Phe)42. Phe was chosen as an analog for
estimating the εα of HIS due to its similar NaClO oxidation yield (~70%42; Supplementary Table
ST3) and aromatic sidechain structure42. εs was obtained by the difference between δ15NUV+POR and
δ15NClO of urocanic acid, a structural analog of HIS's sidechain.
The fraction r, representing the proportion of NO2- derived from α-N oxidation by NaClO reaction,
was estimated by plotting δ15NClO against δ15NHIS-Total for the α-series:
15

15

δ NClO = mα, ClO δ NHIS-Total + cα, ClO

(5)

where mα, ClO and cα, ClO are the slope and y-intercept, respectively. Since δ15NHIS-s remains constant
(δ15NHIS-s0) within the α-series, the only unknown in the equation is r. δ15NHIS-α in equation (3). By
substituting equation (4) into equation (5) to obtain equation (6), and by comparing equation (6)
with equation (3), r can be calculated from mα, ClO while cα, ClO encompasses other constant terms
including the δ15NHIS-s0, εα, and εs:

δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s could thus be calculated from equations (3) and (4) with δ15NClO, r ratio,
and δ15NHIS-Total determined by EA-IRMS or calibrated from δ15NUV+POR:
Uncertainties in δ15NHIS-Total and δ15NClO were reported as the standard deviation of measurements
from replicate IC injections. The uncertainties in δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s were propagated from the
uncertainties in in δ15NHIS-Total, δ15NClO, and r ratio. Additional error contributions from instrument
precision, blank corrections, and calibration were also quantified, with details provided in the
supplementary information.

3. Results and discussions
3.1 Separation and collection of HIS by IC
Baseline separation of HIS from other AAs in both standard mixtures and copepod samples was
achieved using isocratic elution with NaOH and Milli-Q water during the first 33 minutes. The
method demonstrated excellent retention time reproducibility, as evidenced by the overlaid
chromatograms of replicate injections (Figure 2). The IC method was optimized for HIS separation
and collection with a total runtime of 73–77 minutes. This included a 20-minute equilibration
phase at the beginning and a 20-minute post-elution column wash with NaOAc to ensure complete
removal of residual compounds before the next injection. Key parameters such as injection volume,
standard and sample concentrations, and the collection window width were carefully adjusted to
ensure sufficient N mass was collected for subsequent UV + POR oxidation and δ15N analysis.
Aliquots of each HIS fraction, along with IC procedural blanks, were directly subjected to UV +
POR or NaClO oxidation without additional processing.
3.2 UV+POR oxidation and δ15NHIS-Total
Accurate determination of δ15NHIS-Total without isotopic fractionation requires complete and
quantitative oxidation of HIS N to NO3⁻. Persulfate oxidation (POR) is a commonly used method
for converting organic N to NO3-, but low recoveries (~40–60%) have been reported for certain Nheterocyclic compounds, such as benzotriazole and antipyrine54, 55. An alternative approach—UV
oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2)—yields higher recoveries (~85–90%) for similar
compounds, including HIS and adenosine48, 56. To further improve oxidation efficiency, we
adopted the recommendation of Bronk et al.54 to use persulfate as the oxidant in UV oxidation
(UV+POR), as persulfate has a higher reduction potential and is more readily activated by UV
radiation than peroxide57. Compared to POR alone or UV/H₂O₂, UV+POR achieves higher and
more consistent recoveries for refractory compounds while also reducing oxidation time54, 58. The
mole ratio of persulfate to N in the sample typically ranges from 10:1 to 500:1 to ensure complete
oxidation54, 55, 58, 59. In our protocol, we used a ratio of ~216:1, which was sufficient to fully oxidize
HIS.
To evaluate extraneous N introduced during sample preparation and oxidation, we quantified UV
reaction blanks and IC procedural blanks. UV reaction blanks primarily reflect background N in
the persulfate reagent. To minimize this, K2S2O8 was recrystallized three times60. The UV
procedural blank in Milli-Q water measured 1.5 ± 0.4 µM, comparable to previous studies using
POR alone (< 2 µM) and UV/H2O2 (~1.2 µM)54. IC procedural blanks collected from standard
mixture injections exhibited slightly higher N concentrations, averaging 2.3 ± 0.5 µM.
After blank subtraction, oxidation yields of HIS isotopic standards in Milli-Q water and ICpurified HIS fractions from standard mixtures approached 100% following 3 hours of UV exposure
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table ST2). These consistently high yields confirm that HIS is
quantitatively converted to NO₃⁻ in both simple (Milli-Q) and IC matrices (NaOH). Correcting
δ15N measurements of HIS isotopic standards with UV procedural blanks and IC-purified HIS
fractions with paired IC procedural blanks yielded δ15NUV+POR values that closely matched δ15NHISTotal values obtained via EA-IRMS (Table 1, Figure 4a, 4b).
Linear regression between δ15NUV+POR and δ15NHIS-Total measured by EA-IRMS produced slopes
not significantly different from 1 (HIS standards: 1.00 ± 0.01; IC HIS standard fractions: 0.96 ±
0.01), with small intercepts (HIS standards: -0.78 ± 0.12; IC HIS fractions: 0.65 ± 0.15) and strong
Page 8 of 23

linearity (R² > 0.999; Figure 4a, 4b). These results confirm that accurate δ15NHIS-Total values are
obtained when appropriate blank corrections are applied. Furthermore, they demonstrate that
UV+POR effectively converts HIS-N to NO3⁻ with minimal fractionation, whether or not HIS is
first separated via IC.
Measurement precision for δ15NUV+POR ranged from ±0.1‰ to ±1.2‰. Applying equation (2) for
calibration, we determined δ15NHIS-Total values for natural samples ranging from 2.5 ± 0.1‰ to 5.2
± 0.8‰ (Table 2). Propagated error from instrument precision, blank correction, and calibration
was generally below 0.2‰ (Supplementary Information), which is lower than the observed
standard deviation of replicate δ15NHIS-Total measurements (±0.1‰ – 1.3‰). Consequently, the
standard deviation of replicates is reported as the uncertainty for δ15NHIS-Total in Table 1.
The precision achieved in this study is comparable to δ15NHIS-Total uncertainties obtained from
GC/C/IRMS for biological samples (±0.4‰ to ±2.6‰)21, 23, 24 and within the uncertainty range of
δ15N values for other AAs analyzed by CSIA-AA methods (~±0.13‰ to ±1‰)31, 61. These findings
suggest our method is a reliable approach for determining δ15NHIS-Total with high accuracy and
precision.
3.3 Estimation of δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s with NaClO oxidation
NaClO specifically oxidizes the α-N of AA to NH3 via Strecker degradation62, which is then
quantitatively converted to NO2- under alkaline conditions49. The oxidation yield, relative to the
initial α-N concentration, was generally ~70–80% for all HIS standards and natural samples
(Supplementary Table ST3). The reaction blanks were very low (< 1.3µM), minimizing potential
bias in δ15N measurements. Previous studies have reported that a small fraction of sidechain N
from poly-nitrogenous AAs such as HIS, arginine, tryptophan, and asparagine can also be oxidized
to NO₂⁻ during this reaction49. In our study, we calculated r values (the proportion of NO₂⁻
originating from α-N oxidation) of ~0.80–0.83 for HIS isotopic standards in Milli-Q water and ICpurified HIS fractions in NaOH, based on the slopes of δ15NClO versus δ15NHIS-Total in the HIS-α
series (Figure 5a, 5b). This indicates that ~17–20% of the NO2- product originated from the
sidechain-N, which is significantly higher than the oxidation yield of urocanic acid (~3%;
Supplementary Table ST2), a structural analog of the HIS sidechain. The enhanced oxidation of
HIS sidechain N, compared to urocanic acid, may be attributed to the presence of α-N or the
formation of a Strecker aldehyde with an imidazole sidechain during HIS degradation63. This likely
increases the susceptibility of the sidechain N to oxidation, leading to a higher fraction of
sidechain-derived NO2- in HIS relative to urocanic acid, which does not form Strecker aldehyde
during NaClO oxidation.
Given the observed r values for IC-purified HIS fractions, equation (3) can be rewritten as equation
(9).

δ NNaClO = 0.83 (δ NHis-α + 𝜀𝛼 ) + 0.17 (δ NHis-s + 𝜀𝑠 )

The fractionation factor εs for sidechain N was determined as -1.3‰ by subtracting molecular
average δ15N of urocanic acid (3.8 ± 0.8‰, obtained from UV+POR oxidation) from its δ15N (2.5
± 0.9‰) obtained by NaClO oxidation. Substituting εα = + 0.6‰ and εs = -1.3‰ into equation (9),
δ15NHIS-s and δ15NHIS-α could thus be estimated by equations (4) and (9). The combining
contribution of εα (0.6‰) and εs (-1.3‰) to the estimation of δ15NHIS-s and δ15NHIS-α would be +
0.19‰ only, such that δ15NHIS-s and δ15NHIS-α would be mostly driven by δ15NHIS-Total and δ15NClO.

The estimated δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s values for HIS isotopic standards are shown in Table 1. The
α-series exhibited δ15NHIS-s values (~ -8 to -9‰) that were indistinguishable from HIS-0,
confirming that only the α-N was enriched in 15N. In contrast, the w-series showed increases in
both δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s, consistent with the isotopic labeling of all N atoms in this series.
The precision of δ15NClO measurements in HIS fractions from standard mixtures and natural
samples was generally better than ±1.3‰, with most samples showing uncertainties of <±0.7‰.
Errors in δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s, propagated from uncertainties in δ15NHIS-Total and δ15NClO, ranged
from ±0.4–1.0‰ for standard mixtures and ±0.5–1.6‰ for most natural samples. The overall
precision of δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s measurements obtained in this study is comparable to reported
uncertainties in δ15NHIS-Total for biological samples analyzed using GC/C/IRMS21, 23, 24. These
results support the reliability of our analytical scheme for distinguishing α- and sidechain N
isotopic compositions in HIS.
3.4 Molecular average and intramolecular δ15NHIS of natural samples
The δ15NHIS-Total values of natural samples ranged from 2.5 – 5.2‰ (Table 2), consistent with
previously reported δ15NHIS-Total values in biological samples analyzed using GC/C/IRMS (-2.4 –
6.8‰)21-24. To provide further context, δ15N values of the source AA phenylalanine (Phe) and the
trophic AA glutamic acid (Glu) were also measured in the same samples using the IC × PT-CFIRMS method 42. Across all samples, δ15NHIS-Total was lower than δ15NGlu by ~4–16‰ but within
±3‰ of δ15NPhe. This pattern is consistent with previous observations in marine consumers, where
δ15NHIS-Total closely tracks δ15NPhe (<±5‰) but remains significantly lower than δ15NGlu (>10‰)21,
23, 24
. This trend reflects the extensive transamination that enriches Glu in 15N compared to source
AAs, particularly with increasing trophic level7, 45, 64.
Intramolecular δ15N heterogeneity within HIS molecules was observed in the HIS-0 standard and
all biological samples, except for POM (Figure 6, Table 2). The Δδ15Nα-s (δ15NHIS-α – δ15NHIS-s) of
HIS-0 was approximately +8‰. This contrasts with the average Δδ15Nα-s of -9‰ reported by Sacks
and Brenna37 for commercial HIS standards from four different vendors (Acros, Belgium;
Avocado Organics, UK; J.T. Baker, USA; Sigma, USA), which were analyzed by enzymatic
cleavage of α-N followed by GC/C/IRMS. Commercial L-histidine is typically produced via
microbial fermentation65, meaning it retains a biological isotopic signature. The opposing Δδ15Nαs sign in our HIS-0 standard may be caused by the differences in manufacturing processes of HIS
adopted by different vendors. However, the consistent observation of positive Δδ15Nα-s across
biological samples in this study suggests a systematic isotopic fractionation pattern related to N
metabolism.
The cyanobacteria sample, a primary producer capable of HIS biosynthesis, exhibited a positive
Δδ15Nα-s of +2.8‰. This suggests that the relatively 15N-enriched α-N may come from Glu, which
typically has higher δ15N than sidechain N due to extensive transamination during AA biosynthesis.
POM in the surface ocean primarily consists of phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, and detrital
organic matter. The small Δδ15Nα-s in POM (-1.1‰) may result from an integration of biosynthetic
signals from different microbial sources and isotopic fractionation during environmental
degradation. Compared to cyanobacteria and POM, the three consumer samples exhibited
markedly higher Δδ15Nα-s values (fish: +12.6‰, copepods and euphausiids: +23 to +25‰; Table
2, Figure 6), with δ15NHIS-α values elevated relative to δ15NPhe and approaching δ15NGlu. The
substantial 15N enrichment of α-N in consumers is surprising given the limited exchange between
HIS α-N and the metabolic N pool. Since higher trophic organisms cannot synthesize HIS de novo,
Page 10 of 23

it is unlikely that metabolic N directly contributes to HIS formation or to the 15N enrichment of αN. One potential metabolic pathway of HIS involves its reversible conversion to imidazole
pyruvate and another AA by donating the α-N to a keto acid66 (Supplementary Figure 1b).
However, the enzyme responsible for imidazole pyruvate production exhibits low activity under
physiological conditions66-68. Therefore, HIS in consumers should not directly exchange α-N with
other AAs, making it unlikely that δ15NHIS-α tightly coupled with δ15NGlu or the δ15N of the
metabolic N pool.
Instead, we hypothesize that δ15NHIS-α in consumers is influenced by dietary inputs and the extent
of HIS catabolism. The N isotopic fractionation associated with histidase-mediated deamination
of HIS has not been directly studied, but similar ammonia-lyases that cleave α-N of Phe
preferentially remove 14N, leading to 15N enrichment in the residual Phe69. If HIS deamination
follows this pattern, it would increase δ15NHIS-α while having minimal effect on δ15NHIS-s, as the
sidechain N does not participate in deamination. HIS catabolism rates are linked to physiological
and environmental factors such as starvation and N limitation, both of which can decrease HIS
concentrations in diatom and fish70, 71. Additionally, N isotopic turnover and HIS catabolism rates
are typically higher in organs than in muscle tissues70, 72. Thus, interspecies differences in Δδ15Nαs among the consumers may reflect variations in diet quality, growth stage, physiological status,
protein turnover rates, and tissue type73-76. Notably, the strong 15N enrichment in consumer α-N of
HIS has not been previously identified because the δ15NHIS-α signal is diluted by lower δ15NHIS-s
values, resulting in δ15NHIS-Total values that remain comparable to δ15NPhe.
The trophic transfer of δ15NHIS at both molecular average and intramolecular levels within a local
planktonic food web can be inferred by comparing the omnivorous copepods and carnivorous
euphausiids collected from the same location (Supplementary Table ST1). Euphausiids acquire
HIS from copepods or other shared food sources. The nearly identical δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s values
between these two taxa suggest that intramolecular δ15N distribution in HIS remains largely
unaltered during trophic transfer. Future controlled feeding experiments across different
taxonomic groups will provide further insight into how δ15NHIS-α and δ15NHIS-s change with dietary
inputs and metabolic processes.
3.5 Summary
This study validates an analytical framework for measuring δ15N values of poly-nitrogenous amino
acids at both compound-specific and intramolecular levels, using histidine as a model. We
demonstrated that UV+POR oxidation efficiently converts HIS to NO3⁻ in various matrices,
including Milli-Q water and NaOH. This approach can be extended to other poly-nitrogenous AAs,
provided they are baseline-separated and fully oxidized to NO3⁻ by UV+POR. When combined
with NaClO oxidation, which selectively targets α-N, our approach will enable intramolecular δ15N
analysis of poly-N AAs such as arginine, glutamine, asparagine, lysine, and tryptophan.
The analytical techniques and instrumentation used in this approach are widely available, making
the method readily adoptable by many laboratories. For example, conversion of NO3⁻ or NO2⁻ to
N₂O for δ15N analysis is routinely performed in commercial and research facilities using wellestablished methods, including Cd/azide reduction51, the bacterial denitrifier method77, and Ti(III)
reduction50.
Beyond its utility in food web studies, where differential trophic 15N enrichment among AAs helps
infer trophic relationships, intramolecular δ15N analysis of poly-N AAs provides valuable insights
into nitrogen metabolism and biochemical pathways. Potential applications include tracing
