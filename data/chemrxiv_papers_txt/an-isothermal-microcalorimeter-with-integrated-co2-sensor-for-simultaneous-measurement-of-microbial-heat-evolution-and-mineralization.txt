Soil, as the largest terrestrial carbon sink, plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration. Within
soil systems, microorganisms decompose soil organic matter to generate energy and obtain
carbon for growth, concomitantly release heat and CO2 as metabolic byproducts. The
calorespirometric (CR) ratio – defined as the ratio of heat production to CO2 evolution, is a key
indicator of carbon use efficiency and soil anaerobicity. However, conventional methodologies
typically measure heat and CO2 separately, with CO2 often quantified by intermittent
sampling. This discontinuous approach, compounded by the inherent heterogeneity of soil,
introduces uncertainties in calorespirometric analysis. To address this limitation, an infrared
CO2 sensor was mounted onto a stainless-steel calorimetric ampoule, containing soil-glucose
mixtures, enabling simultaneous real-time measurements within an isothermal
microcalorimeter. The novel configuration permits continuous monitoring of both parameters,
validated through comparative analysis with traditional methods. The derived CR ratio aligned
with theoretical predictions for carbohydrates metabolism. Furthermore, parallel oxygen
measurements enabled quantification of CR ratio based on O2 (heat-to-O2), and the
respiratory quotient (CO2-to-O2)), offering deeper insight into microbial carbon-energy
coupling and turnover in soil systems. This methodological advancement enhances the
capacity to interrogate soil biogeochemical processes under dynamic environmental
conditions.

A substantial amount of carbon (C) is stored in soil organic matter (SOM) and many
compounds are utilized by microorganisms for their metabolism. Heterotrophic organisms
gain energy (E) by catabolic reactions and utilize carbon (C) for biosynthesis in anabolism.
Combining these processes results in growth and formation of biomass, which finally can
contribute to C sequestration in SOM (Chakrawal et al., 2021; Kästner et al., 2024). During
microbial metabolism, degraded C thus is either released as CO2 into the atmosphere through
respiration or retained and stabilized as biomass or other forms of SOM in the soil. Microbial
catabolism provides usable E for anabolism in soil but also generates heat. Both heat and CO2
are critical parameters for quantifying microbial traits in soil systems, as microbes require both
matter and E fluxes for growth and maintenance (Herrmann et al., 2014; Chakrawal et al.,
2021; Kästner et al., 2024). The calorespirometric (CR) ratio, defined as the quotient between
specific heat release (𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 ) and cumulative CO2 amount or between heat production rate (𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 )
and CO2 evolution rate (CER), provides insight into various metabolic pathways and growth
(Hansen et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2024; Wirsching et al., 2025). The CR ratio is considered to
correlate with carbon use efficiency (CUE), which quantifies the conversion efficiency of
ecosystem C inputs into microbial C storage in soil systems (Hansen et al., 2004; Manzoni et
al., 2012; Sinsabaugh et al., 2013).

Heat and CO2 are typically measured using separately devices. Microbial metabolic 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 during
soil incubation is conventionally measured using isothermal microcalorimeters (IMCs) such as
TAM Air, TAM IV (TA Instruments, New Castle, USA), I-Cal flex IMC (Calmetrix Inc, Sweden) or
microcalvet (Seteram, France), which offer capacities ranging from 4 to 20 mL for continuous
specific heat production rate (𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 ) monitoring with parallel measurements in 2-48 channels
(Barros et al., 2011; Maskow and Paufler, 2015). Several methods are available for CO2
quantification. Headspace gas sampling followed by gas chromatography quantification is
commonly used for discontinuous but highly accurate CO2 quantification (Tiemann and
Billings, 2011). As an alternative, CO2 can be trapped in NaOH solution and quantified by
titration. This approach is widely followed, though it does not support real-time, online
measurement (Jing et al., 2022; Kabwe et al., 2022). Respirometers are useful devices for
quantifying CO2 production rate by measuring the decrease in the conductance of a KOH
solution caused by sorption of CO2 produced during incubation; these instruments are
suitable for large soil samples (Nordgren, 1988; Endress et al., 2024). However, the
conductimetric sensors used in these systems are temperature-sensitive and require a stable
thermostat for accurate operation (Satienperakul et al., 2004). Additionally, CO2 measurement
after sorption into NaOH or KOH traps might introduce detection delays due to the diffusion
of released CO2 into the alkaline solution (Endress et al., 2024). Another alternative is to apply
a colorimetric method, which determines CO2 respiration through the changes in pH in a dilute
bicarbonate solution containing a pH indicator dye. This approach, based on alkali absorption,
is considered to be convenient but less accurate than methods mentioned above (Rowell,
1995). However, the discontinuous and separate measurement of heat and respiration
complicates the accurate coupling of C and E dynamics and may introduce bias due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of soil matrix.

Several attempts have been made to quantify CO2 and heat simultaneously using several
different methods (Barros et al., 2008; Herrmann and Bölscher, 2015; Wadsö, 2015; Wadsö
and Hansen, 2015; Yang et al., 2024). One approach involved combining a twin-flow
microrespirometer and a calorimeter in an open-flow system to study the ecophysiology of
aquatic organisms (Gnaiger, 1989). Another widely used method integrates the CO2-trapping
solution into calorimetric ampoules, relying on the absorption reaction between NaOH and
CO2. This technique has been applied to soil systems or plant tissues (Criddle et al., 1990;
Barros and Feijóo, 2003; Barros et al., 2011). The extra absorption heat generated by the
sorption of CO2 in the NaOH solution is assumed to be directly proportional to the amount of
CO2 produced, allowing for the calculation of CO2 evolution rate (Criddle et al., 1990).
However, these alkaline-based methods all depend on the assumption that CO2 absorption by
alkaline solution and the resulting reduction in CO2 partial pressure do not alter the soil
metabolism. However, recent experiments have shown that the reduced CO2 partial pressure
may potentially interfere with microbial growth in soil (Yang et al., 2024). Wadsö et al. (2004)
developed a device connecting two isothermal heat conduction calorimeters by a tube, one
of which was filled with a CO2 absorbent. This setup enabled simultaneous measurement of
heat release and CO2 production by two mould fungi. However, the accuracy of heat
measurement exhibits variability, necessitating further technical improvement and enhanced
data interpretation for metabolic flux analysis. Herrmann and Bölscher (2015) proposed
another method combing the microtiter plate method with calorimetric measurements. In
their approach heat disturbance from the sorption between CO2 and bicarbonate was
negligible whereas they only measured cumulative CO2 release at the end of an incubation
period in soil systems. However, this method lacks information on the kinetics of C and E
turnover. Fricke et al. (2024) successfully established a prototype of a calorespirometer by
introducing a thermoelectric generator at the bottom of the measuring vessel in an
established conductometric respirometer, allowing for simultaneous calorespirometric
measurements of E release and CO2 production by yeast growing in a liquid medium, which
has not been tested for longer durations.

The goal of our study was to develop a device capable of simultaneously and continuously
measuring heat and CO2 from the same soil sample while minimizing effects of CO2 diffusion
and soil heterogeneity. We integrated an infrared (IR) CO2 measuring sensor, the SCD41
sensor, directly on top of the calorimetric ampoules. The compact size of this sensor and its
precision at CO2 concentrations relevant for soil incubations makes it ideal for incorporation
into the IMC systems. We tested the reliability of the sensor after integration into the ampoule
caps and the performance of the calorimetric measurements of soil processes with this
approach. Simultaneous heat and CO2 measurement were conducted in parallel to analysis of
residual O2 saturation by an optical fibre sensor for full evaluation of microbial metabolic
pathways. This study presents the design, implementation and experimental validation of the
integrated calorespirometric system. This includes measurements of heat release, CO2
evolution, O2 consumption, the calorespirometric ratio (CR CO2 and CR O2 ) and respiratory
quotient (RQ) from soil amended with glucose.

A silt-loam textured soil sampled from the Dikopshof long-term experiment (DFYM) was used
for the simultaneous heat and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 release measurements. The physicochemical properties of
Dikopshof soil are well-characterized (Lorenz et al., 2024). Glucose was selected as an easily
degradable substrate for testing our calorespirometric system. The air-dried soil was sieved
through 2-mm sieve, with aggregates crushed and stones removed. Water was added to the
sieved soil in a glass beaker to reach 14% (g water per g dry water, gw gdw-1, approximately 46%
of water holding capacity) water content. The glass beaker was then sealed tightly with
parafilm, and the soil was pre-incubated at 20 ℃ for 7 days. After pre-incubation, glucose
solution (min. 99%, CHEMSOLUTE, 45 g L-1) was added to the soil to reach 16% water content
(gw gdw-1, approximately 52% water holding capacity) and glucose concentration of 900 𝜇𝜇g gdw 1. For the control treatment, deionized water was added to pre-incubated soil to reach the
same water content (gw gdw-1). In each round of experiment, around 2.18 g of either glucoseor non- amended soil (equalling to approximately 1.88 g dry weight) per calorimetric channel
was transferred to a 20-mL stainless-steel ampoule, with a top screw lid designed for static
and air-tight calorimetric experiments. Each treatment was performed in triplicate and
monitored continuously for approximately 50 hours.

The IMC used in this experiment, TAM Air (TA Instrument, New Castle, USA), equipped with
eight measuring and reference channels, was utilized for simultaneous heat and CO2
measurement. The SCD41 sensor (Sensirion, 2021; details provided in Supplementary
Materials, SM S1) was mounted on the cap for the stainless-steel vessel, with a customized
cut in the lid to fit the sensor. The SCD41 sensor was connected to a microcontroller (Arduino
Micro or Pro Micro Atmeg32U4, Arduino, Turin, Italy), which supplied 5 V power to the sensor
module and established serial I2C communication. The microcontroller fetched data from the
SCD41 and transferred them to a computer connected via USB for data logging. The
microcontroller was placed externally, outside TAM Air channels. The original plastic heat sink
plug at the top of calorimetric ampoules were replaced by a rubber plug of same size, allowing
the space for cables (37 American Wire Gauge, 37 AWG, Donau Elektronik GmbH, Metten,
Germany) to connect the sensor with the microcontroller. The setup for simultaneous heat
and CO2 measurements is illustrated in Fig. 1. The gas tightness of stainless-steel ampoules
was proven by injecting a gas mixture containing around 2.2% CO2 and monitoring the CO2
concentration over 200 h (see Fig. S1A). As the CO2 concentration only declined from 2.2% to
2.1% over 200 hours (Fig. S1A), we considered the decrease during our experiments as
negligible. Potential heat disturbances from the sensor operation were assessed, and these
findings are also included in Fig. S1B. The heat output of the sensor was relatively constant at
1.6 ± 0.3 mW (Fig. S1B). The stainless-steel ampoule showed comparable heat measurement
behaviour as standard glass calorimetric ampoules.

Figure 1. Set-up of simultaneous measurement of 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) and cumulative CO2 release.
Equal amounts of glucose-amended or non-amended soil were added to an ampoule
with a CO2 sensor mounted on top of the ampoule and the ampoule without CO2 sensor
mounted on top of the ampoule, respectively, which were then positioned within the
channels of the TAM Air (indicated by the bold black lines). The SCD41 sensor
continuously monitors cumulative CO2 concentration in the gas space inside of the
stainless-steel ampoules.

Finally, the ampoules were sealed using the lid and a rubber ring. To improve gas tightness, a
thin layer of silicone grease (GE Bayer Silicones Grease Baysilone Paste Medium Viscosity, 35g,
Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) was applied around the lid. The stainless-steel vessel was
then carefully inserted into the calorimeter channel. To validate the heat signal, two glass
calorimetric ampoules without CO2 sensor and filled with similar amounts of soil were inserted
into TAM Air for both non- and glucose-amended soil samples. Reference ampoules were filled
with 1.362 mL deionized water which is estimated to have same heat capacity as the soil
samples. Before inserting the ampoules, the heat signal baseline was recorded for 30 minutes,
and the mean value of this period was defined as the heat signal baseline. Calorimetric signals
were monitored continuously, with the final dataset exported at 5-second intervals. For CO2
measurement, the SCD41 sensor was activated approximately 1 hour prior to incubation. The
cumulative CO2 evolution was measured in ppm at 15-minute intervals throughout the
experiment, and cumulative CO2 release was calculated from these data. That interval length
was chosen to minimize self-heating of the sensor and maintain adequate data resolution.

In a parallel experimental set-up, O2 concentrations were analysed non-invasively in closed
60-mL vials by optical oxygen sensor spots (SP-PSt7-NAU, PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH,
Regensburg, Germany) attached to the inner wall of the vials. The sensor spot was positioned
slightly above the soil surface within the vials to ensure accurate monitoring. O2 concentration
was monitored at 15-minute intervals at 20 ℃. The air/soil ratio in the 60 mL vial was designed
to match that of the stainless-steel ampoule used in TAM air, ensuring consistency across
experimental conditions.

In Eq. (1), 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) is the specific heat production rate derived from glucose metabolism and
both heat production rate with and without glucose addition were measured and 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) was
calculated as the difference between 𝑃𝑃𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 (𝑡𝑡) and 𝑃𝑃𝑆𝑆 (𝑡𝑡) (SM S3 Eq. (S1)). The total metabolic
specific heat, 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) was determined by integrating the 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) over time, as expressed in Eq.
(1). Analogous to 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡), 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) is the difference between the total heat measured from
glucose-amended and non-amended soil (SM S3 Eq. (S2)).

293.15 K) is the temperature. The equation to calculate 𝑉𝑉𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 is shown in SM S3 Eq. (S3) from
measured cumulative CO2 evolution [ppm] in the airspace. Finally, the increased

The consumed O2 at time = t (O2 (𝑡𝑡)) was converted to 𝜇𝜇mol per gram dry weight soil according

The calorespirometric (CR) ratio is a crucial parameter in distinguishing metabolic pathways
as it integrates both metabolic heat and respiration dynamic. Different approaches are used
in previous studies, based on the quotient between heat release and either CO2 production
(Eq. (5)) or O2 uptake (Eq. (6)) (Hansen et al., 2004).

With the SCD41 sensor present, each measurement produced a certain amount of heat,
resulting in periodic noise according to the 15-minute measurement interval. This heat
production added up to the metabolic 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡). This additional heat must be accounted for when
evaluating the raw data. To address the heat interference caused by the IR sensor
measurement, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) frequency domain analysis followed by an
inverse FFT (IFFT) analysis to process the filtered data was performed using R Studio (version
4.3.0). This dual-transformation approach effectively isolated and removed sensor-induced
thermal noise. Detailed information of the implementation and parameter specifications are
provided in SM S4 (Cooley and Tukey, 1965).

The final 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) at t = 50 hours was compared between samples with sensor and without
sensor, for both non-amended and glucose-amended soil treatments to assess the
disturbance caused by sensor operation on data accuracy. The comparison was conducted by
using a one-way ANOVA with contrasts between treatments regarded significant at a
significance level of 𝛼𝛼 = 0.05 with the “stats” package in R (v. 4.3.0, Hirsch, (2024)).

Glucose was rapidly metabolised after addition to the soil, resulting in a relatively sharp peak
of 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) and continuously increasing CO2 concentrations (Fig. 2) whereas both 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) and CO2
production remained on a low level in the unamended soil. 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) peaked at approximately 20
hours and stabilized at the metabolic baseline after around 50 hours. 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 (𝑡𝑡) production
amount exhibited a similar trend, aligning the accumulated 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) value. The integration of
the CO2 sensor into the lids of calorimetric ampoules enabled simultaneous and continuous
measurement of metabolic heat release and respiration from the same soil sample,
overcoming limitations posed by CO2 diffusion and soil heterogeneity.

To validate the heat measurement with the SCD41 sensor on top of the ampoule, 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 was
measured in glucose-amended and non-amended soil, both with and without the sensor. In
non-amended soil, 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 remained relatively constant, averaging at 4±1 𝜇𝜇 W gdw-1 with the
sensor and 5±1 𝜇𝜇W gdw-1 without sensor (Fig. 2A). In glucose-amended soil with the sensor,
𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 increased over the first 20 hours with a peak at 68±9 𝜇𝜇W gdw-1 around 21 h, and stabilized
at a metabolic baseline of 17±12 𝜇𝜇W gdw-1 by approximately 50 hours (Fig. 2B). Similar trends
were observed in standard glass ampoules, with a metabolic peak at 64±12 𝜇𝜇W gdw-1 at 21

hours (Fig. 2B). In non-amended soil, 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 only showed a slight increase, reaching 0.60±0.03 J
gdw-1 with the sensor and 0.7±0.2 J gdw-1 without the sensor (Fig. 2C). The integrated 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 for
glucose-amended soil increased to 5±1 J gdw-1 over 50 hours, regardless of whether the sensor
was present or not (Fig. 2D). Measurements of both 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 and 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 using the sensor-integrated
system aligned closely with those from the systems without sensor, with no significant
differences observed in 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 at 50 hours across both experimental configurations (Fig. S2). This
consistency demonstrates that the sensor integration did not compromise the accuracy of
metabolic heat production measurements, provided that the data were corrected for the heat
output of the sensor. In glucose-amended soil with sensor, the error range increased from the
peak time until reaching the final metabolic baseline, compared to configurations without the
sensor (Fig. 2B).

During the 50-hour incubation, metabolic CO2 production reached 16±1 𝜇𝜇mol gdw-1 for soil
with glucose addition while the total O2 consumption was 12±3 𝜇𝜇mol gdw-1. As depicted in
Fig. 3A, CO2 evolution consistently exceeded O2 consumption, with the disparity reaching
approximately 5±3 𝜇𝜇mol gdw-1 after 50 hours. The RQ increased from 0 to approximately
1.4±0.4 mol mol-1 at 21.5 hours, aligning with the peak in 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 . Subsequently, RQ stabilized
between 1.3 and 1.5 mol mol-1 from 21.5 hours to 50 hours (Fig. 3B). The calorespirometric
ratio based on oxygen consumption (CR O2 ) fluctuated during the first 10 hours but then
increased from 150±170 kJ mol O2 -1 to approximately 419±119 kJ mol O2 -1, remaining stable
at 407±121 kJ mol O2 -1 between 30 to 50 hours (Fig. 3C). In contrast, CR CO2 (based on CO2
evolution) rose slightly from 247±133 kJ mol CO2 -1 to 358±249 kJ mol CO2 -1 at around 7 hours,
before decreasing to approximately 272±52 kJ mol CO2 -1. Between 20 and 50 hours, CR
remained relatively stable at around 272±44 kJ mol CO2 -1 (Fig. 3D).

This study demonstrates the successful integration of a CO2 sensor into IMC, exemplified by
the SCD41 sensor and the TAM Air system. The integration of the SCD41 sensor into the IMC
enables simultaneous quantification of heat and CO2 flux from the same soil sample, even with
minimum sample volume. This innovation addresses challenges associated with soil
heterogeneity, enabling robust and continuous monitoring of heat and CO2 dynamics. Such an
approach supports the real-time calculation of key derived parameters, including CR, CR O2
and RQ, thereby providing a dynamic framework to interpret C and E fluxes over the
incubation period.

Validation experiments demonstrated a neglectable influence of the sensor on the
determination of 𝑄𝑄𝑚𝑚 for both non- and glucose-amended soil treatment, affirming the
reliability and non-invasive nature of this integrated system for monitoring CO2 and 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 .
Compared to methods using CO2 trapping solution (Barros et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2024), the
sensor-based integration avoids interference with microbial activities due to almost complete
elimination of CO2 from the gas phase. However, very high CO2 partial pressures (>100 hPa,
approx. 9.87%) in the headspace may also inhibit microbial growth (Onken and Liefke, 1989).
The final percentage of CO2 in our measurement was approximately 3% while the remaining
O2 in the air space was around 18%. However, this CO2 level is below a concentration that is
typically expected to have an influence on the metabolic activity of the soil microbial
community. The relationship between CO2 concentration and microbial growth rate, however,
is highly dependent on soil properties, the chemical compositions of the substrate (relevant
to energy content), and the degradability and availability of the substrates, which cannot be
conclusively determined by this single study (Blagodatskaya et al., 2010). The system
developed in this study allows investigations to elucidate this relationship for different soils
and substrates.

Another important feature of our system is its capability for continuous and real-time
measurements. This facilitates the analysis of dynamic and growth-phase specific metabolic
CR parameters, offering significant advantages over end-point measurements (Herrmann and
Bölscher, 2015) or discontinuous set-ups and discrete measurements which analyse heat and
CO2 in separate replicates (Endress et al., 2024; Wirsching et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025).
Compared to twin-flow systems for CO2 and O2 measurement (Griddle et al., 1990), the
integrated CO2-sensor in IMC offers a more streamlined and efficient design, requiring only a
single measurement channel and eliminating the need for connecting the calorimeter vials to
external sensors or tubing which bear the risk of thermal bridges introducing bias and
increased variation in the measurements. By omitting the use of NaOH as CO2 trap, the system
avoids limitation associated with NaHCO3 formation, as well as potential disturbance of 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚
measurements during NaOH replenishment, extended equilibrium settings and abrupt

reductions in 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 due to the opening of the channels (Barros et al., 2017; Barros Pena, 2018;
Griddle et al., 1991). Still, prolonged experiments at high aerobic microbial activities would
require regular aeration, introducing disturbances by opening the vials (Yang et al., 2024).

344

346

348

However, the evaluation of 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 with the presence of the SCD41 sensor was more complex than
standard treatments, primarily due to the significant heat disturbance caused by the sensor’
IR operation at a 15-minute interval. We selected a relatively long-time interval for CO2
measurements compared to the 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 measurements in order to minimise the thermal
disturbance by the operation of the sensor and to have a characteristic frequency for signal
filtering. The necessary signal processing to suppress these disturbances included FFT filtering.

As depicted in Fig. 2B, the error of 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 for glucose-amended soil after 30 hours increased
threefold compared to the treatment without sensor. This became particularly evident during
the later stages of incubation when metabolic activity has diminished while the heat release
by the sensor remains constant. The disturbance in the later phase can be attributed to two
factors. Firstly, variability between replicates due to soil heterogeneity and uneven substrate
distribution may increase measuring error as reported by Endress et al. (2024b), especially for
glucose-amended soil. Second, the SCD41 sensor, as an IR-based sensor, generated a
consistent intrinsic heat output of 1.6 ± 0.3 mW, which by far exceeded the maximum
metabolic 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 from the soil in this experimental setup (SM Figure S1B). This highlights the
impact of the sensor’s intrinsic heat generation on the calorimetric measurements and the
necessity of careful signal processing. Further efforts will therefore be made in future to
reduce the heat output of the CO2 sensor. Another issue can arise in soils with high CO2
production or with large sample quantities. The upper sensor detection value is 5% by volume.
To address these challenges in future developments, an improved flow-through system
incorporating an air-pump and placing sensor-integrated ampoules externally of TAM Air is
proposed. This design would enlarge the soil sample capacity while minimizing the influence
of the sensor’s heat output on calorimetric accuracy.

RQ has been commonly used to evaluate microbial activities in soil and to study soil
metabolism processes (Dilly, 2001). However, in practice, RQ varies depending on the
metabolized substrate compositions (sugars ~1, proteins ~0.67-1.01, lipids ~0.68-0.80 organic
acids ~0.97-4.2, Hicks Pries et al., 2020), environmental conditions, and nutrient levels. In our
study, the RQ significantly exceeded 1 throughout the entire incubation period. Under aerobic
degradation of carbohydrates such as glucose, the RQ is theoretically equal to 1. In our
experiments, a slightly higher CO₂ production relative to O₂ consumption potentially indicates
extra C mobilisation from SOM was observed, resulting in RQ of approximately 1.3–1.5. These
findings align with values reported in previous studies for arable soil amended with glucose,
where RQ ranged from 1.25 (Theenhaus et al., 1997) to as high as 1.6 or even greater (Dilly,
2001; Dilly and Zyakun, 2008), depending on different soil types. Several factors may explain
the elevated RQ observed in this study. RQ greater than 1 can result from the use of
alternative electron acceptors such as NO3-, the conversion of carbonates or organic acids,

As predicted by the equation proposed by Hansen et al. (2004), CR CO2 should fall within the
range of 0-600 kJ mol-1 CO2. In our study, CR CO2 ranged from 247±133 kJ mol CO2 -1 to

358±249 kJ mol CO2 -1, aligning with the theoretical range mentioned and closely matching
experimental observations of 200 – 600 kJ mol CO2 -1 reported in previous studies (Wadsö et
al., 2004; Harris et al., 2012; Barros et al., 2016). Similarly, Endress et al (2024b) reported
CR CO2 equal to 344 kJ mol CO2 -1 at 50 hours for glucose-amended soil incubation. However,
in their study for CR CO2 dynamic, using the standard model, CR CO2 was predicted to firstly
stabilize from on 4 hours and then decline sharply at around 25 hours to approximately 250
kJ mol CO2 -1. When accounting for the delay caused by CO2 diffusion and sorption into KOH
solution, the CR CO2 values matched more closely to experimental observations and also
previous studies (Yang et al., 2024). This finding confirms the potential impact of a 1.2 to 1.8
hours delay of CO2 measurement, emphasizing the importance of correcting for the diffusion
effect, which can be addressed by our setup without the need for CO2 absorption by alkaline
solutions and eliminate the reduction of CO2 partial pressure. Therefore, the devices proposed
in this study could potentially eliminate the issue of CO2 diffusion, providing CR CO2 dynamics
closely aligned to the standard model prediction.

Hansen et al. (2004) predicted CR O2 should always be equal to 455 kJ mol-1 O2 in aqueous
environment. Our observations of CR O2 (419±119 kJ mol O2 -1) aligned with the values (439
kJ mol-1 O2) found by Endress et al (2024b). Hansen et al. (2004) claimed that deviation of
CR O2 from 455 kJ mol-1 O2 can only occur under anaerobic conditions in aqueous solutions
with nonzero reaction enthalpy existing in the systems. However, continuous O2 monitoring
in this study showed no strong indication of O2 limitation or depletion, suggesting that the
experimental setup was largely aerobic and free from significant anaerobic interference.

This study demonstrates the successful integration of the SCD41 sensor into IMC, allowing
non-invasive, simultaneous measurement of heat and CO2 flux from small arable soil samples.
By addressing challenges associated with soil heterogeneity and delayed detection due to CO2
diffusion and supporting dynamic calculation of metabolic parameters alongside parallel O2
measurement, the presented approach outperforms previous methods through minimizing
interference with microbial activities from reduced CO2 partial pressure. In addition, the
suggested methodology is well-suited for high-throughput applications in soil analyses, as it is
compatible with multi-channel calorimeters such as the TAM IV-48 (TA Instruments, New
Castle, USA) or Symcel’s 48-well calScreener (Symcel, Stockholm, Sweden), which are already
optimized for parallel sample analysis. The study validates the integrated setup as a reliable
and innovative tool for studying microbial activity and soil metabolism under aerobic
conditions while offering scalability and adaptability for broader experimental applications in
soil systems.

Sensirion SCD41 sensor (SCD41-D-R2) is an emerging IR sensor in the field of CO2. The small
size (10.1 × 10.1 × 6.5 mm3) and large output range (0 ppm – 40000 ppm with accuracy of
± (40 ppm + 5%)) of the sensor enables the integration into other measuring techniques
such as calorimeter. The accuracy and linearity of SCD41 is shown in Figure S1(C). Detailed
information can be found on https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD41. The SCD41 was
used with the SCD-41 breakout board from Adafruit, providing I2C pull resistors and a linear
voltage converter. To implement the communication protocol of the sensor on the
microcontroller, the respective Sensirion libraries for the Arduino platform were employed.

To ensure the gas tightness of stainless-steel ampoules. One proving experiment was
conducted by injecting mixed air with around 2% CO2 into the ampoule and ran over 200
hours. The gas leaking rate was calculated by linear regression of remaining CO2 concentration
versus time. Meanwhile, the same ampoule was inserted into the TAM Air for heat production
rate monitoring for sensor noise baseline determination. As shown in Figure S1(A), after
injection, CO2 dropped from approx. 2.2% to approx. 2.1% after 200 hours and thus the
leaking rate is approximately 0.00045% h-1 which is considered as negligible in our data
analysis. Continuously monitored 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 remained mostly constant during the entire time period
and demonstrated the mean value of 1.6 ± 0.3 mW which is used for baseline correction for
data analysis of soil incubations.

S4 FFT filter method for denoising

The FFT filtering method is proven to be an effective tool for denoising periodic disturbances
(Yoshizawa et al., 2011; Wolcott and Campbell, 2015). In our experiments, the SCD41 sensor
measured 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 saturation [ppm] at 15-minute intervals. Every 15 minutes the sensor was
switched into “singal-shot” measuring mode for three consecutive measurements within
about 30 seconds for averaging then going idle for the remaining time in the 15 minutes cycle.
The increased sensors’ power consumption during the 30 seconds active measurement
resulted in a very regular calorimetric noise pattern. The 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 was exported with a 5 second
interval. Thus, the FFT method was applied to each 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) data set to obtain the frequency
domain representation (𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 (𝑡𝑡) using Eq. (S5)). The power spectrum (𝐼𝐼) of the corresponding
dataset was calculated by squaring the magnitude of the FFT and normalized by the total
length of the measuring time (∆𝑡𝑡). A frequency factor (𝑓𝑓) was generated manually (Eq. (S7)),
representing the frequency axis corresponding to the FFT results. The cutoff frequency was

chosen based on the desired filtering characteristics. The index corresponding to this cutoff
frequency was identified by finding the minimum absolute difference between the frequency
vector and the cutoff value. To perform denoising, a zero operation was applied to the FFT
coefficients corresponding to frequencies higher than the cutoff. The inverse FFT (Eq. (S8))
was then computed on the modified FFT coefficients to reconstruct the denoised signal in the
time domain and the denoised signal was normalized by dividing the total number of samples
(𝑛𝑛).
