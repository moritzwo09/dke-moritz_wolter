Abstract: The chemistry underlying biological homochirality remains challenging. We propose
that non-covalent clusters may have served as the means through which homochiral biochemistry
emerged. Serine has long been known to exhibit a chiral preference in clustering to form the
octamer; we extend this finding by reporting the effects of a non-zero e.e. in serine on the chiral
preference seen in the formation of non-covalent clusters with other amino acids and in the
formation of their covalent condensation products, peptides. We show (i) enantiopure serine
directs racemic leucine and proline toward enantioselective dipeptide formation in water
microdroplets and (ii) likely intermediates are seen as amino acid substitution products into the
serine octamer cluster. This work indicates the relevance of microdroplet sprays, such as those
found in natural aerosols, to molecular clustering phenomena and to homochirality.

Introduction
Non-covalent chemistry has been somewhat neglected in the study of the origins of homochirality.
A range of physical processes has been proposed to explain the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) that has
emerged in extant biology1-3 but we here demonstrate a chemical process, implicating non-covalent

effects, that produces asymmetric bio-oligos. Work studying the gaseous serine octamer (a noncovalent assembly of serine monomers with a pronounced preference for homochirality)4-8 and
microdroplet reactivity, principally within the mass spectrometry community, has identified
avenues for the formation of prebiotically significant molecules.9-14 We thus suggest that chemical
processes at the air-water interface and in the gas-phase may explain the asymmetry of biology’s
polymers.4, 14
It is known from MS studies that aqueous microdroplets, which possess large interfacial areas
relative to their volumes, enable spontaneous formation of peptides from free amino acids without
the use of any coupling reagent.15,16 Furthermore, microdroplets are known to facilitate molecular
clustering, including formation of the serine octamer with its pronounced homochiral preference.1719

We here report that enantiopure serine facilitates previously unknown chemistry: an

enantioselective, prebiotically plausible route to peptide formation.
Microdroplets—and chemical “microenvironments” more broadly—have long been proposed to
feature in prebiotic chemistry.20,21 Serine’s chiral preference as a gas-phase molecular cluster,
whether ionized or neutral, whether generated by spraying a solution or sublimation, has been the
subject of robust interrogation. Most notably, its octamer exhibits strong homochiral preference
which is maintained when it substitutes other biomolecules, namely hexoses or amino acids, for
one or two serine units.17-19,22 More broadly, we show that the serine octamer is a strong case
demonstrating the general phenomenon that molecular clusters, held together by ion/dipole forces,
represent a medium in which steric effects may amplify the thermochemical gap between
enantiomers.23 In fact, the common methods of separating enantiomers (chromatography, kinetic
method, crystallization, etc.) all depend on non-covalent interactions exerting asymmetric
influence.

The experiments we report show that enantiopure serine directs peptide chirality in the course of
peptide bond formation between racemic leucine and proline in water microdroplets. The
ProLeu/LeuPro dipeptide formed displays a chiral preference that matches serine’s chirality; i.e.,
microdroplets containing L-Ser preferentially generate L-ProLeu/LeuPro dipeptides, or conversely
with D-Ser, D-ProLeu/LeuPro dipeptides are formed. Neither of these experiments utilized chiral
agents or catalysts other than the amino acids themselves. The use of non-racemic Ser in the
reaction solution is prebiotically plausible because the macroscopic accumulation of local Ser
chiral excess has been demonstrated;22 even if only a microscopic enrichment is conceded, the
micrometer scale of the chemistry here reported can be interpreted as a realization of the proposal
of microenvironment chiral excess.21 Thus, we demonstrate the transformation of biological
monomers (amino acids) into oligomers (peptides) and propose a model to explain how a matrix
containing non-zero e.e. serine directs racemic amino acids to enantioselective oligomerization.
We propose non-covalent, microdroplet-based chiral transmission, dependent upon a chiral
cluster, the serine octamer; with this species exhibiting enantioselective amino acid substitution
and so accounting for the observed asymmetric accumulation in the ProLeu/LeuPro dipeptide.
This suggestion combines the previous finding of the serine octamer’s ability to enantioselectively
incorporate other amino acids with the observation that these serine-based clusters
enantioselectively control peptide bond formation between free amino acids in water. Accepting
two known properties of microdroplet sprays (i) they produce the serine octamer with its
preference for homochiral assembly and (ii) they promote the condensation reaction of amino acids

formation (Figure 1).

Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH USA, and L-Ser, Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA), while LPro was labeled 13C 5 , 99%; 15N, 99%, and L-Leu was labeled 13C 2 , 99% (Cambridge Isotope Labs,

Each solution was loaded (in 2.0 μL aliquots) into pulled borosilicate capillary nano-electrospray
ionization (nESI) emitters with 5 μm inner tip diameter and positioned 2 cm from the MS inlet
(capillaries and P97 puller, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA USA); each measurement was repeated
4 times over multiple days between which the instrument was cleaned. Tandem MS analysis gives

quantitation. Note the chemical noise at ~5% relative abundance (R.A.) which necessitates the
added specificity of tandem MS for quantitation as opposed to the simpler measurement of [M+H]+

High resolution MS analysis confirmed the molecular formula assignments of precursor and
product ions (S2). The relative abundance of the dipeptide products was calculated by scaling the
abundance of heavy isotope L-dipeptide signals to those of the D-dipeptide and comparing to the
no serine case. Relative abundances presented in Figure 3 reflect the average ratio observed over
4 trials and the error bars indicate ± 1 sample standard deviation.
Results and Discussion
Our results demonstrate enantioselective peptide formation and the role of serine in this selection.
Soln. 2, which has L-Ser, shows 1.7 ± 0.4 times more L-ProLeu/LeuPro product relative to soln.
3, while soln. 3 shows 1.6 ± 0.4 times more D- ProLeu/LeuPro than soln. 2. The chiral preferences
of the D- vs. L-Ser case satisfy one tailed t-tests past the 99% confidence level (p-values in Figure
3, S3). Furthermore, under the same conditions that generated the peptide, these solutions exhibited
the serine octamer cluster ion and its enantioselective incorporation of leucine and proline
monomers.
The enantioselectivity favoring the homochiral cluster of 6 Ser, 1 Leu, and 1 Pro compared to the
heterochiral cluster matches the enantioselectivity observed in peptide formation. Thus, in the
clusters generated from soln. 2, a 2:1 ratio of homochiral to heterochiral substitution was observed,
favoring the incorporation of L-Leu and L-Pro. In the clusters generated from soln. 3, a 3:2 ratio
was observed, favoring the substitution of D-Leu and D-Pro (S4). This finding offers mechanistic
support for our model of non-covalent chiral transmission, suggesting that the clusters are reaction
intermediates which yield the peptides.
Octamer substitution is suggested to be the locus for enantioselection: peptide formation is
enantioselective because it follows the chiral preference observed during hybrid cluster formation.

Directly supporting this suggestion, peaks at m/z 859 and 867 corresponding to six Ser monomers
clustered with a protonated ProLeu/LeuPro dipeptide were observed to accompany the amino acid
substituted serine clusters. These findings, taken together with the quantitation of homochiral
peptide products, are summarized in Figure 4.
Peptide products containing serine were not detected, and diproline and dileucine products were
detected only at low levels from sprayed solns. 1, 2, and 3, without apparent enantioselectivity
(S5). We speculate that there are characteristics of Leu and Pro that make them particularly
susceptible to asymmetric microdroplet peptide formation; namely, Leu’s R-group is electron
donating and stabilizes the intermediate during nucleophilic attack, while Pro has been shown to
efficiently incorporate in condensations;26 the steric bulk of the R-groups in Pro and Leu likely
increase their susceptibility to enantioselective peptide bond formation. Evidence that the effect
measured by tandem MS is not due to isotopic substitution is found in the reversal seen between
the L-Ser and D-Ser data: similar chiral excess in the ProLeu/LeuPro product was measured when
the ProLeu/LeuPro was or was not isotopically labeled. Nevertheless, we supported our findings
further with a control experiment where isotopically labeled L-Leu was not used (S6).
These experiments were designed to simulate prebiotic chemistry. It is probable that water, Leu,
Pro, and Ser were available on the early earth and elsewhere in the solar system.27-31 If so, it seems
certain that these compounds would be found in prebiotic Earth’s microdroplets, whether sea
sprays, clouds, or fog, or any other abiotic aerosol.20 That serine, in particular, could have been
present in elevated e.e. is supported by the results of past experiments that demonstrate monomeric
enantioenrichment, without any additional chiral actor.22,32 Further, enantioenrichment has been
anticipated at the “microenvironment” scale and our work is an empirical realization of this
concept.21 Crystallization,33-37 mineral mediated processes,38 polarized light,39 meteoric

seeding,40,41 and most recently, chirality-induced spin selectivity42,43 provide additional pathways
to monomeric chiral excess—such as in the serine non-zero e.e. that we presupposed in our study.
An alternative explanation of the observed enantioselection relates to the phase behavior of serine.
Considering literature showing enantioenrichment of serine during crystallization, dissolution, and
sublimation,22,32 it could be suggested that the microdroplet spray and desolvation processes of
nESI involve two separate phase transitions: (i) serine crystallization as solvent evaporates and (ii)
sublimation or nebulization to give gaseous serine. In this case, it would be possible for
crystallization to “stack the deck” by sequestering all of the minor enantiomer in the
thermodynamically favored conglomerate crystal, while the excess of the major enantiomer
remained in solution prior to nebulization or as the solid sublimes to form non-racemic gas phase
serine. Recent computational efforts, however, suggest that serine does not proceed through a
crystalline intermediate in the course of nESI and octamer formation.19 Rather, analytes escaping
bulk solution and entering the interfacial regions of the microdroplets where peptide condensation
is proposed to occur and where clusters—such as the octamer—may exist between the gas and
solvated phases would explain the enantioselectivity observed in dipeptide formation.18, 10 At
present, the best evidence available—the direct observation of serine octamers corresponding to
putative reaction intermediates—suggests the direct involvement of the octamer cluster in the
observed enantioselection.

Figure 4. Summary of the chemistry observed: non-covalent octamers formed from
enantiomerically enriched serine favor homochirality in their substitution of Leu and Pro for Ser,
thereby enantioselectively extracting monomers from the Leu and Pro racemate, directing the
accumulation of covalently bound homochiral dipeptides. Here, yellow circles represent L-Ser
monomers, red represents D-amino acids, green represents L-amino acids.
Thus, in summary, our experiment models a situation in which serine has acquired a non-zero e.e.,
and then dissolves along with other amino acids present in racemic form, and this solution is
dispersed as microdroplets. Our empirical results indicate that the chiral selection observed in the
serine octamer is closely linked to that peptide formed in microdroplets. Our experiment extends
prior demonstrations of prebiotically plausible enantioselective bond formation at the monomer
level to the cluster level.4 Though we showed enantioselectivity with enantiopure serine, there is
no reason to expect that a lesser e.e. would not generate an intermediate effect with less (but not
zero) enantioselectivity in peptide products. We have experimentally implicated non-covalent,
steric effects, which others44,45 have theorized might underpin molecular selection during chemical

evolution. The chiral transmission described herein enables monomeric excess to accumulate in
covalent oligomers, priming evolution for homochirogenesis (see S7).
Conclusion
Despite the early discovery of chirality,46 the literature lacks consensus to explain homochirality’s
origin. In large part, this is attributable to the fact that there is no fundamental difference between
D- and L-biomolecules and “mirror life” is apparently possible.47 In fact, some D-amino acids are
found in biology.48 The physical explanation for an inherent, albeit slight, symmetry breaking has
been proposed in the molecular parity violation energy,49,50 which explains the initial non-zero e.e.
from which monomer level enrichment could occur. Thus, we surmise that biological asymmetry
must have its basis in chemical reactivity in evolution’s earliest stages; we then presuppose the
presence of amino acids and proceed to demonstrate a mechanism which enables chiral
transmission with enantioenrichment accumulating in oligomers from racemic monomers. We
argue that because our system accumulates chirality in oligomers, it represents a form of chiral
amplification, wherein an initial asymmetry propagates, as in the classic Frank autocatalysis
mechanism (though some might hesitate to call microdroplet chemistry “catalysis”).51-53
This study connects the accumulation of enantioenriched monomers, such as amino acids, to
asymmetric bond formation in oligomers without the influence of chiral surfaces or external
electromagnetic fields. We have elucidated a chemistry in which chiral recognition may occur
outside the condensed phase (through microdroplet-formed serine octamer) and demonstrated that
this process correlates with asymmetric dipeptide formation. We have uncovered the control of
peptide chirality via chiral serine in microdroplet chemistry: symmetry breaking during bio-
