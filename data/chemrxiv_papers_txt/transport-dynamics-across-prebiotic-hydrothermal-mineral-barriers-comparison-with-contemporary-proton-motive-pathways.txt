ABSTRACT
Extant life relies on phospholipid membranes that selectively manage the flux of materials from
one side to another. Prior to the development of such complex organic membranes, the separation
of life from nonlife, or inside from outside, may have been achieved by geological inorganic
barriers. Submarine alkaline hydrothermal vents, with their inherent pH gradients across inorganic
mineral structures and a steady supply of H2 and CO2, are considered plausible environments for
the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. Analogous to extant life, which harnesses proton
gradients for CO2 reduction, these vents may have facilitated early carbon fixation through
electrochemical processes mediated by Fe(Ni)S minerals. To investigate the potential bottlenecks
in such prebiotic scenarios, we electrochemically characterized the electron and ion conductivity
of synthetic FeS, Fe(Ni)S, and Green Rust under aqueous conditions mimicking a hydrothermal
vent interface, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our results reveal that these
minerals exhibit substantial electronic conductivity (1.5 x 10-2 - 3.6 x 10-2 S/cm) and moderate
ionic conductivity (1.01x10-6 – 6.22x10-5 S/cm). Contemporary phospholipid membranes, by
contrast, allow significant ion passage but are electrically insulating. These findings provide
insights into the physicochemical properties of hydrothermal vent minerals and their potential role
in facilitating early prebiotic reactions. Specifically, we introduce to the pH gradient hypothesis
the concept of ion conductivity as a possible limiting factor on the flow of electrons needed for the
production of organics across vent mineral barriers.
INTRODUCTION
What separates life from non-life? Philosophically, countless ideas have been proposed,
including the ability to replicate, to metabolize, to grow and to die.1, 2 A common feature of all
known life is its physical organization into cellular systems compartmentalized by phospholipid
membranes3, which are thermo-oxidatively and electrochemically stable electrical insulators that
are permeable to gasses4, 5 and that selectively permit the flux of specific ions at specific times.6

Hadean submarine hydrothermal vents have long been proposed as potential hatcheries for
life, due to the presence of interfaces containing mineral that may have acted as metalloenzyme
precursors, mediating key protometabolic reactions analogous to those occurring on cell
membranes.10-12 In such environments, protometabolic steps are hypothesized to have been driven
by natural electrochemical gradients at these interfaces, potentially seeding the emergence of
metabolism.13, 14
7-9

Drawing from clues in extant life, researchers have focused on early alkaline hydrothermal
vents (AHVs). These vents likely hosted alkaline H2-rich fluids that were separated from their
surroundings by an inorganic barrier containing Fe(Ni)S mineral clusters and mixed-valence iron
oxyhydroxides, also known as green rust (GR), such as fougerite.15-18 Such barriers can also help
sustain a pH gradient between the vent interior and the mildly acidic (pH 5.5), CO2- and metalrich early ocean.19, 20 17, 21 This structural organization resembles (and may even be homologous
to) the setting extant methanogens and acetogens utilize pH gradients, maintained by active proton
pumping, to drive CO2 reduction by H2 oxidation. In methanogens, the pH gradient serves as an
energetic driving for intracellular reduction reactions, which are catalyzed by various enzymes
whose active sites contain Fe(Ni)S clusters. A hypothesis that has captured the interest of
phylogeneticists and molecular biologists alike is the possibility that CO₂ reduction via H₂
oxidation in AHVs represents a geochemical analogue of the Wood–Ljungdahl Acetyl-CoA
pathway, a metabolic pathway believed to date back to the last universal common ancestor
(LUCA).7, 22, 23 The fact that this is the only known CO2 fixation pathway shared by both bacteria
and archaea supports the idea that it may predate the divergence of these domains. It is therefore
possible that the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, or a simpler precursor, was used by LUCA or
prevalent in prebiotic chemistry.
Several recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of prebiotic scenarios in which pH
gradients drive the coupling of CO2 reduction and H2 oxidation across Fe(Ni)S-containing
inorganic barriers in hydrothermal systems.19, 20, 24 To better understand the underlying
mechanisms of these laboratory analogues, we must identify the factors driving or limiting this
reaction. The electrical conductivity of individual crystals on the nanoscale has been raised as a
possible bottleneck for CO2 reduction, and the permeability of these barriers to different ions has
been explored25. The kinetics of surface processes has also been considered as a possible limiting
factor for reactivity.26 We summarize in Figure 1 the four most likely processes that may act as
bottlenecks: (a) electron conductivity (Figure 1a), ion transport (Figure 1b), the kinetics of CO₂
reduction (Figure 1c), and the kinetics of H₂ oxidation (Figure 1d).
In the present work, we focus on the conductivity of AHV inorganic barriers. On the
macroscopic scale, electron and ion transport across barriers are intrinsically linked: to maintain
charge balance, electron flow cannot outpace ion flow, and vice versa, despite the fact that the
local transport mechanisms differ (electrons can move through conductive mineral structures,
whereas ions pass through pores and channels). However, the extent to which either electron or
ion transport limits the overall CO2 reduction in prebiotic hydrothermal systems remains unclear.
Consequently, a growing body of literature is focused on electrochemical characterization of
hydrothermal vent minerals.²⁴⁻²⁸ In this context, the purpose of this study is to determine the

to the electrical conductivities observed in extant life.

Figure 1. Ion, electron, and molecular passage across barriers in contemporary methanogens and hydrothermal vent
minerals.

To investigate the conductivity properties of our synthetic vent minerals, we employed
models based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. This technique uses small
perturbations of a system under electrochemical equilibrium, and the relation between the
impedance of a system and the frequency of that perturbation. From those relations, equivalent
circuit models can be developed to extract parameters related to electron conductivity, ion
transport and capacitive effects at the interface.
We used this approach to compare the modern chemiosmotic mechanism operating at
biological membranes (Figure 1) with a proposed precursor to chemiosmosis. In the latter case,
Fe(Ni)S minerals within an inorganic barrier are hypothesized to mediate catalytic CO2 reduction
driven by a pH gradient similar to that used in extant life - but through electrochemical rather than
proton-motive mechanisms.

All solutions were prepared with high-purity water (Milli-Q system, 18.2 MΩ.cm) and reagentgrade chemicals. The electrolytes were prepared as previously described.19, 24, 27 For gas saturation
of solutions, N2, CO2 and H2 (highly pressurized, purity: 99.99%) were used.
FeS and Fe(Ni)S samples were synthesized by co-precipitation: 50 mM FeCl2 (and
optionally 5 mM NiCl2 for Fe(Ni)S) was reacted with 100 mM Na2S as previously described.8, 19,
24, 27
In this work, ocean analog and vent fluid analogs were mixed in a 1:1 ratio to form the
precipitated synthetic Fe-S mineral.
Electrochemical Methods
Using a PTFE electrode jig as shown in Figure 2, experiments were performed using a twoelectrode setup using an Admiral Squidstat Plus potentiostat. In the small channel between the two
graphite electrodes, we placed wet mineral pastes. The geometric surface area of the electrode that
was in contact with the electrolyte was 28.58 mm2. Fe(Ni)S minerals were synthesized by the coprecipitation mentioned above. In addition, moisturized commercial mineral powders were also
tested. For commercial samples, ~1 g of powder was mixed with 5 mL of ocean analog fluid,
followed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 minutes. The resulting paste (for both synthetic and
commercial samples) was transferred to the jig channel between the electrodes. A quartz cover slip
was placed over the paste to seal the assembly. All mineral pastes were hydrated with ocean analog
fluid to simulate conditions expected in early submarine hydrothermal systems.

Potentiostatic Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (PEIS) was used to characterize
the minerals in an electrochemical setting simulating an early hydrothermal vent interfaces. PEIS
was performed at open circuit voltage (OCV) from 1 Hz to 1 MHz with an amplitude of 10 mV.
Calculation of Electrical and Ionic Conductivity
Electron conductivity values were obtained from the uncompensated resistance (𝑅! ),
determined from Nyquist plots or fitted from equivalent circuit models (see Table 1). Once
resistance was known, resistivity (𝜌) was calculated using equation (1), where 𝐿 is the mineral

Figure 3. Nyquist plots from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results for different Fe-based minerals
using our PTFE reactor setup.

Nyquist plots (Figure 3) are commonly used in the field of electrochemistry to represent
EIS results. This plot displays Z’ and -Z’’ that represent, respectively, the imaginary and the real
part of the impedance vector (Z(ω)=Z’-jZ’’) in the complex plane, for different values of
perturbation frequency. The plots shown in Figure 3 provided insight into the electronic and ionic
conductivities of the mineral barriers under simulated hydrothermal vent electrochemical
conditions. Focusing on FeS, FeNiS and green rust (GR), we fitted equivalent circuit models to
their impedance data (Figure 4). These models were adapted from the work of Arzola and
Genesca28, which also guided our interpretation of each circuit element in terms of interfacial
properties.28 The models include components representing the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the
mineral film capacitance and resistance (Cfilm and Rfilm respectively), and the charge transfer
resistance (Rct). These parameters were extracted from fitting and are summarized in Table 1, along
with the calculated electrical and ionic conductivities of each mineral.
As expected, FeS and green rust GR exhibited notable electrical conductivity, in
accordance with previous works.24, 29 The measured electronic conductivities (of the order of 10-2
S/cm) are comparable to those of some semiconductors, conductive polymers and saline solutions.
These materials also demonstrated moderate ionic conductivity, likely facilitated by the disordered
nature of the hydrated mineral paste, allowing for ion movement through the aqueous phase
between mineral grains.

DISCUSSION
Modern cells tightly regulate ion transport across membranes using active and passive
mechanisms, yet their membranes are essentially insulating to electrons (electrical conductivity ≈
5 × 10*+% S⋅cm-1)21. In contrast, the Fe-based minerals we investigated have significantly higher
electrical conductivities (1.5 × 10*# - 3.6 × 10*# S⋅cm-1) and only moderate ion conductivities
(1.01 × 10*- – 6.22 × 10*. S⋅cm-1).
Contemporary methanogens create and exploit proton gradients across their membranes by
actively pumping H⁺ ions out of the cell. The return of protons down this gradient powers energyrequiring reactions such as ferredoxin reduction via hydrogen oxidation, catalyzed by the
membrane-bound proton-motive enzyme Ech. In this process, H⁺ and H₂ can permeate the
membrane, but electrons cannot. Prior studies of hydrothermal vent analogs²² suggest that the
reducing species crossing mineral barriers may not be H₂, but rather free electrons. However, if
electrons do traverse the barrier, maintaining charge neutrality would require a counter-balancing
ionic flux, via either co-moving cations, oppositely moving anions, or a combination of both. Our
findings suggest that while mineral barriers allow efficient electron transfer, ion transport is

considerably more limited. Thus, under prebiotic conditions, the rate of ion flux required to
maintain electroneutrality may represent a bottleneck for sustained protometabolic activity and the
formation of organic products.
CONCLUSIONS
Our electrochemical characterization of synthetic FeS, Fe(Ni)S, and green rust under
simulated hydrothermal vent conditions revealed that these minerals exhibit significant
conductivity for electrons and moderate conductivity for ions. These properties support the
hypothesis that such mineral barriers could mediate electron transport across redox and pH
gradients in early Earth environments, facilitating prebiotic CO₂ reduction coupled to H₂ oxidation.
Our results suggest that electron transport is unlikely to be the limiting step for protometabolic
redox reactions at mineral interfaces. Instead, the comparatively slower ion transport may impose
constraints on the rate or extent of organic synthesis. These findings offer quantitative insight into
the electrochemical behavior of Fe-based minerals, and their relevance to scenarios of early
prebiotic chemistry relying on the electrochemical coupling of H2 oxidation on one side of a
mineral barrier with the reduction of organics on the other side.
