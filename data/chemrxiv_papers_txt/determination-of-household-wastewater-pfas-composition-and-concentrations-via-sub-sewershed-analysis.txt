Abstract

22

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in wastewater, challenging water

23

reuse efforts. The PFAS in wastewater are contributed by industrial, commercial, and residential

24

sewerage users. To date, very little is known about the composition and concentration of PFAS

25

discharged by households. We addressed this important knowledge gap by analyzing 24-hour

26

composite wastewater samples obtained for seven consecutive days from three residential sub-

27

sewersheds upstream of wastewater treatment plants. Tap water collected from parks at each sub-

28

sewershed was also analyzed. Although tap water contained some PFAS, we found more analytes

29

and higher concentrations in the residential wastewater samples, suggesting PFAS was

30

introduced at households. The daily ∑PFAS was 10.43 – 49.14 ng/L across the locations. There

31

were no significant (p > 0.05) differences in PFAS concentrations measured on weekdays

32

compared to weekends. PFHxA, PFOA, PFHxS, and PFOS were present in all the samples we

33

obtained, indicating their consistency in consumer products and, thus, residential wastewater.

34

PFOA and PFOS accounted for 12 – 61% of the daily ∑PFAS. We estimated individual PFAS

35

contribution as 2.27 – 10.71 µg/capita/day, with more affluent neighborhoods discharging more

36

PFAS. This is the first study to estimate per capita PFAS using wastewater from upstream

37

household discharge points.

Introduction

50

1.

51

Long-term exposure of humans to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can potentially

52

lead to serious health concerns such as cancer, immune system disruption, and developmental

53

issues in children.1, 2 Yet, almost half of US drinking water contains PFAS.3 PFAS are a group of

54

synthetic chemicals produced since the 1940s. They are commonly used in firefighting foams,

55

water-resistant clothing, food packaging, non-stick cookware, etc.4 These uses are based on the

56

properties of PFAS, including their surfactant nature and stability under extreme conditions.5

57

However, the stability of PFAS also makes them highly resistant to natural degradation processes.

58

As a result, PFAS are ubiquitous in environmental matrices.6-10

59
60

PFAS are routinely detected in wastewater.11, 12 Unfortunately, conventional wastewater

61

treatment processes cannot effectively eliminate PFAS,13-15 and the transformation of PFAS

62

during biological treatment can lead to more persistent perfluorinated compounds forming.14, 16

63

Unsurprisingly, PFAS have been detected in effluent-receiving surface water and groundwater,8,

64

17, 18

65

the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently established maximum contaminant

66

limits (MCLs) for some PFAS.19 To meet these limits and goals, there is a need to understand

67

and address the sources of PFAS in wastewater.

which typically serve as drinking water sources.7, 9 To safeguard the health of Americans,

68
69

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) receive input from residential, commercial, and

70

industrial wastewater contributors. The contributions of different industries and commercial

71

outfits to the PFAS loading in wastewater have been well-documented.4, 20-22 However, a critical

72

knowledge gap—understanding the specific contributions of households to the PFAS mass

73

loading in municipal wastewater—still exists. Although residential PFAS mass loading is

74

expected to be lower than industries’, household discharges typically represent the major portion

75

of municipal WWTPs’ influents. Also, existing PFAS MCLs are in the ng/L range, which makes

76

every PFAS source important. While the amounts of PFAS in certain consumer products like

77

personal care products, cleaning supplies, and food packaging have been surveyed,21, 23-28

78

available information is not exhaustive. In addition, quantifying household PFAS loading from

79

the PFAS content of consumer products will have enormous uncertainties.

80
81

The most direct measurement of residential PFAS contribution was recently reported by Lin et

82

al.,29 who sampled sewershed discharges from households in 14 San Francisco, CA

83

neighborhoods. However, they were limited to grab or one-day 24-h composite samples.

84

Whether PFAS discharges from homes vary during weekdays vs. weekends is still unclear. More

85

so, there is still no investigation of the impact of socioeconomic status on households’ PFAS

86

discharge. This study aimed to (1) experimentally determine the temporal variation of PFAS

87

contribution from households to municipal wastewater, (2) estimate PFAS contribution per capita

88

using wastewater from upstream household discharge points, and (3) perform a preliminary

89

examination of relationships between socioeconomic status and household PFAS discharge. This

90

is the first study to estimate per capita PFAS and investigate any influence of socioeconomic

91

status using wastewater free of industrial input.

Materials and Methods

93

2.

94

2.1. Description of study areas and sample collection

95

We collected wastewater samples from three residential sub-sewersheds accessed through

96

manholes in three Southern California cities. To maintain confidentiality, the exact locations of

97

the sub-sewersheds are not disclosed in this article. Instead, they are referred to as “Location A”,

98

“Location B”, and “Location C”. The residential sub-sewersheds are in cities with populations

99

ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 residents, and the selected manholes provided access to sewer

100

systems serving between 500 and 800 single-family homes in each city. Based on the

101

neighborhoods’ CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile scores, which are calculated using 21

102

socioeconomic indicators,30, 31 we classified Locations A (score = 6), B (score = 71), and C (score

103

= 43) as having a high, low, and medium socioeconomic status, respectively. Detailed

104

information about each city can be found in Section S1 of the supporting information (SI).

105
106

2.2. Sample collection

107

We collected 24-h composite wastewater samples daily for seven consecutive days (Monday to

108

Sunday) from the manholes providing access to the residential sub-sewershed wastewater.

109

Seven-day sampling allowed us to investigate any short-term temporal variation in PFAS release

110

(e.g., weekdays vs. weekends). We programmed automated samplers (Hach AS950, Loveland,

111

CO) equipped with 10-L LDPE carboys (US Supplies, IL) and Hach silicone tubing to collect 66

112

grab samples (150 mL each) over 24 h. The frequency of sample collection correlated with the

113

diurnal wastewater flow. The autosamplers were packed with ice to keep the sample temperature

114

below 6°C sample collection, as recommended in EPA Method 1633. Since tap water is the main
6

115

component in wastewater, we collected tap water samples from a park within each residential

116

sub-sewershed on the first sampling day.

117
118

The carboys and autosampler tubings were used once and thereafter disposed of to prevent

119

carryover contamination. We decontaminated the autosamplers and their accessories, tools, and

120

surfaces before each sampling session by sequentially using LC-MS grade methanol (Fisher

121

Scientific), LC-MS grade water (Fisher Scientific), and Canadian spring water, which is certified

122

PFAS-free by SGS AXYS. Additional information on decontamination procedures and sample

123

collection were provided in SI Sections S2 and S3, respectively.

124
125

2.3. Wastewater characterization and PFAS analysis

126

The pH, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total ammonia-nitrogen (TAN), dissolved

127

metals, nitrite, and inorganic fluoride of the wastewater samples were determined (see details in

128

SI Section S4). SGS AXYS Analytical Services performed PFAS extraction and analysis

129

according to EPA Method 1633.32 SGS AXYS is accredited by the Canadian Association for

130

Laboratory Accreditation (CALA) and the US Department of Defense Environmental Laboratory

131

Accreditation Program (DoD ELAP). The 40 analytes targeted by the method are listed in Table

132

S1. Based on the information provided by SGS AXYS, samples were spiked with extracted

133

internal standards (EIS) before extraction using solid phase extraction. After extraction, the

134

samples were treated with carbon, spiked with non-extracted internal standards (NIS), and then

135

analyzed using liquid chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. A

136

minimum of five calibration points were used, and the mid-level calibration standard was injected

137

at least every 12 hours to confirm the initial calibration.

138
139

2.4. Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC)

140

For QA/QC, we collected instrument blanks, sample duplicates, and field blanks. The instrument

141

blanks were used to confirm effective decontamination of autosamplers and tubings (with respect

142

to PFAS). We obtained instrument blanks by passing an amount of the PFAS-free spring water

143

through the autosamplers after the tubings were fitted, just before deployment into the manholes.

144

The water sample was collected for analysis thereafter. Field blanks were obtained by leaving

145

HDPE bottles containing 500 mL of the PFAS-free spring water open during wastewater

146

subsampling from the carboys on the field. Due to limited resources, we collected instrument

147

blanks, field blanks, and sample duplicates only on the first sampling day at each location.

148
149

2.5. Data analyses

150

We assessed data normality and homogeneity of variance using the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's

151

tests, respectively. A value of p > 0.05 was considered acceptable for both tests. For normally

152

distributed data with homogeneous variance, we applied a two-way analysis of variance

153

(ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey's HSD test to evaluate statistical significance. Datasets

154

that did not meet the assumptions of normality or homoscedasticity were analyzed using the

155

Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. Paired t-tests were used to determine statistical differences

156

in sample duplicates. In addition, we determined the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ)

157

among the analyzed PFAS. Analytes below their limit of quantification (LOQ) were represented

158

by their limit of detection (LOD)/√2.33

Results and Discussions

161

3.1. PFAS composition in household wastewater obtained at residential sub-sewersheds

162

The measured physicochemical parameters of the wastewater samples from the three residential

163

sub-sewershed locations (pH, conductivity, total dissolved metals, TAN, COD, nitrite, and

164

inorganic fluoride) were within the range expected for domestic wastewater (see details in SI

165

Section S5 and Figure S1).34-36 The 40 targeted PFAS were below their LOQs (Table S2) in the

166

field blanks (indicating that no external contamination occurred during fieldwork) and

167

instrument blanks (demonstrating effective decontamination of autosamplers). There were no

168

statistically significant differences in the duplicate samples for Locations A (p = 0.59), B (p =

169

0.45), and C (p = 0.21).

170
171

To evaluate the occurrence frequency of each PFAS at relevant levels in the wastewater collected

172

from each manhole, we determined their quantifiable rates, defined as the fraction of the 7

173

sampling days a given PFAS was detected at a concentration greater than its LOQ (Eq. 1):

174

177

Seventeen PFAS were detected in samples collected from Location A at levels > LOQ (Figure

179

including perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic

perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA)—in all the samples from

Location A (100% quantifiable rate). Among the perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs),

183

perfluorobutanesulfonic

184

perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) had a 100% quantifiable rate. As for the other PFAS we

185

detected at Location A, the quantifiable rates of perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS) and

186

perfluoro-3,6-dioxaheptanoic acid (NFDHA) were 86% and 29%, respectively. Meanwhile,

perfluorododecanesulfonic acid (PFDS), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS), and 8:2

192

We detected 15 PFAS in the wastewater samples collected from Location B (Figure 1b). These

193

include the PFCAs (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, perfluorotridecanoic acid

194

(PFTrDA), and PFTeDA), PFSAs (PFBS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS, and perfluorononanesulfonic

195

acid (PFNS)), fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (6:2 FTS and 8:2 FTS), and 5:3 fluorotelomer

196

carboxylic acid (5:3 FTCA). PFHxA and PFOA were the only PFCAs detected above their

197

respective LOQs in 100% of the samples collected at Location B, unlike Location A where 7

198

PFCAs had a 100% quantifiable rate. The quantifiable rates of the other PFCAs detected were

199

43% for PFBA, 29% for PFPeA and PFTeDA, and 14% for PFHpA and PFTrDA. As for the

200

PFSAs, PFHxS and PFOS had a 100% quantifiable rate, followed by PFBS at 86%, and PFHpS

201

at 14%. We observed a quantifiable rate of 14% for each of 5:3 FTCA, 6:2 FTS, and 8:2 FTS.

207
208

Like Location B, we detected 15 PFAS in the wastewater samples obtained from Location C,

209

including PFCAs (the C4-C10 homologs and PFTeDA, which is a C14 PFCA), PFSAs (PFBS,

210

PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS, and PFDS), 6:2 FTS, and N-Methylperfluoro octanesulfonamide (N-

211

MeFOSA). Five compounds, PFOA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS, and PFHxA, had a 100%

212

quantifiable rate at Location C (Figure 1c). Among the PFCAs that did not have a 100%

213

quantifiable rate, PFBA was detected above its LOQ in 71.4% of the samples, while PFNA and

214

PFDA had a 42.9% and a 28.6% quantifiable rate, respectively. PFTeDA was quantifiable in only

215

14.3% of the samples collected at Location C. As for PFSAs with <100% quantifiable rate,

216

PFHpS and PFDS were detected above their respective LOQs in 14.3% of the samples. We

217

detected N-MeFOSA above its LOQ in 42.9% of the samples while the quantifiable rate of 6:2

218

FTS was 29%.

219
220

Despite differences in the demography and socioeconomic status of the cities, PFOA, PFOS,

221

PFHxS, and PFHxA were consistently detected above their LOQ in all the samples obtained

222

from the three locations (Figure 1d). Lin and coworkers also reported high detection frequency

223

for PFHxA and PFOA in residential wastewater collected from the San Francisco Bay area.29

224

Our observation suggests that these four compounds may be candidate signature compounds for

225

residential PFAS contribution, and should be further investigated.

226
227

3.2. PFAS concentration in household wastewater obtained at residential sub-sewersheds

228

Location A: The mean daily sum of 40 PFAS (∑PFAS) for the 7-day sampling was 28.92 ± 10.72

229

ng/L, and the median was 24.64 ng/L. The daily ∑PFAS ranged from 19.04 to 49.14 ng/L over

230

the 7-day sampling period. There was no significant (p = 0.68) difference in ∑PFAS during the

231

weekdays vs. weekends (Figure 2a). The variation in ∑PFAS reflects daily fluctuations in the

232

discharged mass of individual compounds, particularly the long-chain PFCAs like PFOA, PFNA,

233

PFHpA, and PFDA (Figure 2a and Table S3). For instance, PFOA concentrations ranged from

234

1.93 ng/L to 6.31 ng/L (Δ = 227%), while PFNA concentrations varied by 232% from 0.52 ng/L

235

to 1.73 ng/L. Similarly, the concentrations of PFHpA and PFDA varied by 227 and 198%
12

236

increase, respectively. For the PFSAs, PFOS ranged from 2.80 to 3.96 ng/L (Δ = 42%), while

237

PFHxS varied from 0.60 to 1.06 ng/L (Δ = 61%). We only detected 6:2 FTS and 8:2 FTS once

238

(on day 2) in the wastewater collected from Location A, but at substantial concentrations, 19.7

239

and 6.67 ng/L, respectively.

240
241

Although individual PFAS concentrations fluctuated daily, their relative proportion was stable

242

over the 7-d sampling period at Location A (Figure S2). PFCAs comprised 32-82% of the PFAS

243

mix (Figure S3), making them the most abundant subgroup. Within the PFCA subgroup, the

244

short-chain compounds constituted 22-59% of the total PFAS (or 56-75% of the PFCAs)

245

measured daily. This finding is reasonable since PFCAs are abundant in consumer products,23, 37

246

and short-chain PFCAs, like PFBA, are being used to replace the more persistent long-chain

247

homologs, such as PFOA.13, 38 On average, PFBA was the most abundant analyte (mean = 5.05

248

± 1.42 ng/L), accounting for 8-25% of the total PFAS measured daily. The next most abundant

249

PFCAs in the wastewater were PFHxA (mean = 4.17 ± 1.30 ng/L), PFPeA (mean = 3.51 ± 1.00

250

ng/L), and PFOA (mean = 3.10 ± 1.00 ng/L). PFSAs were also abundant, contributing 15-31%

251

of the daily total PFAS. In contrast to the trend we observed with the PFCAs, short-chain PFSAs

252

(comprising 2-9% of the total PFAS) were less abundant than their long-chain homologs

253

(comprising 9-24% of the total PFAS). PFBS (mean = 1.32 ± 0.83 ng/L) was the most abundant

254

short-chain PFSA, while PFOS (mean = 3.38 ± 0.50 ng/L) was the most abundant long-chain

255

PFSA.

263
264

Notably, the concentration of PFOA in the wastewater we obtained on Day 5 from Location A

265

(6.31 ng/L) exceeded its National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) Maximum

266

Contaminant Level (MCL) of 4 ng/L.39, 40 Similarly, the maximum concentration of PFOS that

267

we obtained, 3.96 ng/L (on Day 6), was essentially at its MCL (4 ng/L). This indicates a potential

268

challenge for wastewater reuse, particularly since conventional treatment techniques are

269

inefficient for removing PFAS from wastewater.41, 42 In addition, the degradation of precursors

270

during wastewater treatment may further increase the concentrations of regulated compounds in

271

the treated effluent. In contrast to PFOA and PFOS, the PFNA and PFHxS concentrations were

272

below their established MCLs.

273
274

The tap water we obtained from a park within Location A’s sub-sewershed contained very low

275

amounts of 5 PFAS (∑PFAS = 3.19 ng/L; Figure S4), including PFPeA (0.98 ng/L), PFHxA

276

(0.71 ng/L), PFOA (0.51 ng/L), PFBS (0.58 ng/L), and PFOS (0.42 ng/L). These compounds

277

were all detected in the wastewater collected from Location A but at much higher concentrations

278

(mean values = 3.51 ng/L, 4.17 ng/L, 3.10 ng/L, 1.32 ng/L, and 3.38 ng/L, respectively).

279

Nevertheless, tap water PFAS accounted for 12.4 – 43.5% of the PFAS in wastewater, which

280

implies that tap water could substantially contribute to the PFAS in residential wastewater. The

281

higher PFAS concentrations in the residential wastewater samples (than tap water) confirmed the

282

introduction of PFAS into wastewater from household products.

285

ng/L, and the median was 13.92 ng/L. Daily, we detected ∑PFAS ranging from 10.43 to 36.14

286

ng/L (Figure 2b and Table S3), but there was no significant (p = 0.92) difference in ∑PFAS over

287

the 7-d sampling period. However, there was a significant (p = 0.01) difference between the

288

weekday and weekend ∑PFAS at Location B, and the concentration of analytes varied widely.

289

For instance, PFHxA ranged from 1.86 to 5.4 ng/L (Δ = 190%), PFOA varied by 160%, between

290

0.94 and 2.44 ng/L, while PFOS ranged from 1.31 to 5.93 ng/L (Δ = 353%). Compounds such

291

as 6:2 FTS (2.62 ng/L), 8:2 FTS (3.36 ng/L), and 5:3 FTCA (16.10 ng/L) were detected only

292

once out of the seven sampling days.

293
294

On average, PFCAs (28-55%) and PFSAs (27-66%) comprised the bulk of the total PFAS we

295

detected over the 7-d sampling period (Figures S5 and S6). Short-chain PFCAs comprised 20-

296

36% of the total PFAS and 55-80% of the total PFCAs, signifying the prevalence of these

297

compounds in consumer products. Among the PFCAs we detected, PFHxA (mean = 3.02 ± 1.19

298

ng/L) accounted for 14-23% of the total PFAS, followed by PFBA (mean = 2.15 ± 0.32 ng/L;

299

accounting for 11-18% of the total PFAS) and PFOA (mean = 1.81 ± 0.57 ng/L; accounting for

300

7- 17% of the total PFAS). Unlike the PFCAs, short-chain PFSAs (0-19% of the total PFAS)

301

were less abundant than the long-chain PFSAs (21-57%). PFBS (mean = 1.68 ± 0.54 ng/L, 4-

302

19% of the total PFAS) was the only short-chain PFSA we detected at this location, while PFOS

303

(mean = 3.37 ± 0.45 ng/L, 10-32%) was the most abundant long-chain PFSA we detected here.

304
305

PFOS in the residential wastewater from Location B reached or exceeded its drinking water MCL

306

3 out of the 7 sampling days (Table S3). This implies that PFOS from this residential sub16

307

sewershed might challenge water reuse efforts in some regions. In contrast, the concentrations

308

of the other PFAS that have drinking water MCLs and were detected in the wastewater from

309

Location B—PFOA, PFBS, and PFHxS—were below their respective drinking water limits.

310
311

Tap water collected from a park within Location B’s sub-sewershed contained six PFAS (Figure

312

S4), including perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA; 2.45 ng/L), PFHxS (1.28 ng/L), PFOS

313

(0.99 ng/L), PFOA (0.88 ng/L), PFBS (0.53 ng/L), and PFHxA (0.42 ng/L). Except for PFOSA,

314

these analytes were all present in the residential wastewater from Location B at higher average

315

concentrations than in tap water (13.9 – 62.8% of wastewater levels). However, several

316

compounds were detected in the wastewater that were not observed in the tap water from this

317

location (Table S3 and Figure 2b). The higher number and concentrations of PFAS in wastewater

318

relative to tap water demonstrate that household activities introduced PFAS to wastewater. The

319

absence of PFOSA in the wastewater generated from the tap water at Location B is not fully

320

understood, but it may have to do with the partitioning or transformation of PFOSA, a common

321

precursor of PFOS.43, 44

322
323

Location C: The mean and median ∑PFAS for the samples collected over 7-d was 17.16 ± 4.55

324

ng/L and 16.12 ng/L, respectively. The daily ∑PFAS ranged from 11.06 to 24.93 ng/L (Table S3).

325

There was no significant (p = 0.59) difference in the ∑PFAS measured on weekdays and

326

weekends; however, the mean PFBS concentration we detected during the weekday was

327

significantly (p < 0.05) greater than in the weekend (Figure 2c). Furthermore, the variation in

328

the concentrations of individual compounds over the 7-d sampling period was not statistically
17

329

significant (p = 0.12). PFHxS concentration varied by over 1500% between 0.59 and 9.57 ng/L,

330

while 6:2 FTS varied by 489% (between 1.85 and 10.9 ng/L) during the 7-d sampling period.

331
332

PFCAs, which comprised 14 – 48% of the total PFAS found at Location C, were not as abundant

333

as the PFSAs, which comprised 35 – 83% of the total PFAS (Figures S7 and S8). Short-chain

334

PFCAs comprised 7 – 30% of the total PFAS in the residential wastewater obtained at Location

335

C and 47 – 71% of the total PFCAs, in agreement with the abundance of short-chain PFCAs in

336

consumer products. Long-chain PFCAs accounted for only 6-21% of the total PFAS. PFBA was

337

the most abundant PFCA (mean = 2.37 ± 0.21 ng/L), accounting for 10-19% of the total PFAS

338

measured daily. The next most abundant PFCAs in the wastewater were PFHxA (mean = 1.65 ±

339

0.55 ng/L; 6-16 % of the total PFAS), and PFOA (mean = 1.54 ± 0.43 ng/L; 4-13 % of the total

340

PFAS). Long-chain PFSAs—PFOS and PFHxS—dominated the PFAS profile in the wastewater

341

from Location C, constituting 29-79% of the total PFAS detected (Figure S8). Short-chain PFSAs,

342

though less abundant than their long-chain homologs, comprised 4-21% of the total PFAS.

343
344

Five of the six PFAS with drinking water MCLs, PFOA, PFNA, PFBS, PFHXS, and PFOS, were

345

detected in the wastewater from this residential location (Figure 2c and Table S3). PFOS (4.23 –

346

6.49 ng/L) was consistently above its drinking water MCL throughout the sampling period. The

347

occurrence of N-MeFOSA, a PFOS precursor, in the wastewater from Location C further raises

348

concerns that treated effluent may have PFOS at levels that limit its reuse for drinking purposes.

349

The highest concentration of PFHxS that we detected, 9.57 ng/L, was also close to the

350

compound’s MCL (10 ng/L). In contrast, PFNA, PFBS, and PFOA were below their respective
18

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4g13w-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2181-4922 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

351

MCLs throughout the sampling period, with maximum concentrations of 0.73, 3.21, and 2.36

352

ng/L, respectively.

353
354

We detected only two PFAS—PFOSA and PFOS— above their LOQs in the tap water collected

355

from a park near the manhole at Location C (Figure S4). Both PFAS were present at very low

356

concentrations: 0.86 ng/L for PFOS and 0.41 ng/L for PFOSA. While the tap water PFOS was

357

15.6% of the average concentration we detected in wastewater from the same neighborhood,

358

PFOSA was not detected above its LOQ in the wastewater samples. As hypothesized earlier, the

359

absence of PFOSA in wastewater may be due to partitioning to the solid phase (e.g., conveyance

360

pipes) due to its high partitioning coefficient,44 or transformation to PFOS, which was one of the

361

most abundant PFAS in the wastewater samples from this neighborhood.

362
363

Overall, Location A has the highest levels of PFAS, with ∑PFAS ranging from 19.04 to 49.14

364

ng/L. Also, the PFAS in wastewater from this location, particularly long-chain PFCAs, like

365

PFOA and PFNA, have a high degree of variability (Figure 2a). Location B, in contrast, had a

366

lower ∑PFAS (10.43 – 19.37 ng/L) and fewer fluctuations of individual compounds (Figure 2b).

367

The concentrations of PFAS at Location C (11.05 to 24.93 ng/L) were between those of Locations

368

A and B. Variances in PFAS concentrations at Location C were also moderate, except for PFHxS

369

(Figure 2c). The overall residential wastewater ∑PFAS we obtained in this study (10.21 - 49.14

370

ng/L) is comparable to the PFAS concentrations in the influents of WWTPs primarily receiving

371

residential discharges (31 – 132 ng/L),45 but lower than in WWTPs also receiving industrial

372

wastewater (847 ng/L or more).46, 47 These results underscore the significant impact of residential

373

sources on PFAS levels in municipal wastewater.

374
375

PFAS profiles for the three residential sub-sewershed varied substantially (Figure 3a). A two-

376

way ANOVA test using the aligned rank transformed method was conducted to evaluate the

377

effect of sampling day, location, and their interaction on the PFAS measured at the three sub-

378

sewersheds. While sampling day (p = 0.27) and the interaction between sampling day and

379

location (p = 0.84) had no significant effect, location was a significant (p = 0.01) variable in

380

determining PFAS concentrations. To further understand the differences in the three residential

381

sub-sewershed, we performed principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA explained 63.5%

382

of the total variance (PC1: 37.5%, PC2: 26.0%). Location A samples clustered predominantly in

383

the negative PC1 region, forming a distinct elliptical pattern separate from those of Locations B

384

and C, which perfectly overlap primarily in the positive PC1 region with a diagonal spread along

385

PC2 (Figure 3b). This clustering pattern suggests differences in PFAS profiles at Location A

386

compared to the other two locations, which agrees with ANOVA that location impacts residential

387

PFAS profile.

388
389

Short-chain PFCAs constituted a smaller fraction of the total PFAS at Locations B (20-38%;

390

Figure S6) and C (7-30%; Figure S8) than at Location A (24-64%; Figure S3). Similarly, the

391

overall PFCA proportions at Locations B (28 – 55%) and C (14-48%) were less than at Location

392

A (32-82%). In contrast, PFSAs made up a substantial portion of the total PFAS at Locations B

393

(27-66%) and C (35-83%), which were notably higher than at Location A (15-31%). At Locations

394

B and C, long-chain PFSAs (21-57% and 29-79% of total PFAS, respectively) were the dominant

395

PFSA type, whereas long-chain PFSAs at Location A only accounted for 9-24% of the total PFAS.

396

These similarities in the PFSAs between Locations B and C were probably partly responsible for

397

their overlap in the PCA score plot (Figure 3b).

406
407

PFOS and PFOA are often the most detected PFAS in the environment, which is typically

408

attributed to their persistence in the environment from past exposures.14, 48, 49 We found that

409

PFOA and PFOS accounted for 12 – 29% of the daily ∑PFAS at Location A, 19 – 44% at

410

Location B, and 30 – 61% at Location C (Figure 3c). Their concentrations in the residential

411

wastewater samples were up to 706% higher than in tap water, when present (Table S3). The

412

detection of these legacy PFAS in residential wastewater at levels much higher than in tap water

413

suggests that PFOA and PFOS are still being released into the environment from household

414

products, which may further explain their environmental abundance despite their phase-out from

415

production (in 2002) and elimination from emission and product content (in 2015) in the US. It

416

is unclear if their presence in household wastewater implies that they are still present in the

417

supply chain, mainly in products imported from countries with no ban/phaseout, or formed from

418

the transformation of precursors.

419
420

3.3. Relationships between residential wastewater PFAS and socioeconomic status

421

Based on the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile ranking for their census tracts, we classified

422

Locations A, B, and C as neighborhoods with high, low, and medium socioeconomic status,

423

respectively. This allowed us to evaluate any correlations between the socioeconomic status of

424

households and the amount of PFAS in household wastewater (using the measured average
22

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4g13w-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2181-4922 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

425

∑PFAS). Location A, which has the lowest CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile score of 6 (high

426

socioeconomic status), also had the highest 7-d average ∑PFAS in household wastewater (28.91

427

± 10.72 ng/L) (Figure 3d). Location B has the highest CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile score (71;

428

low socioeconomic status) and the lowest 7-d average ∑PFAS (17.03 ± 8.89 ng/L). Lastly, the

429

CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile score of the census tract for Location C is 43 (midway between

430

that of Locations A and B), while the 7-d average ∑PFAS for household wastewater was 17.16

431

± 4.55 ng/L.

432
433

Based on these data, the neighborhood with the highest socioeconomic status also had the highest

434

amount of PFAS in their wastewater, and vice versa (Figure 3d). Linear regression was used to

435

test if CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile ranking could predict the 7-d average ∑PFAS. We obtained

436

a regression coefficient of -0.19. However, the overall regression was not statistically significant

437

(R2 = 0.82; p = 0.28). We performed similar tests to determine if CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile

438

ranking could predict the PFCAs and PFSAs concentrations. The regression coefficients were -

439

0.20 (for PFCAs) and 0.02 (for PFSAs), but the regressions were not significant (p > 0.05 in both

440

cases). It should be noted that the higher PFAS concentrations in the wastewater from richer

441

neighborhoods are not due to higher tap water PFAS concentrations (Figure 3e).

442
443

Although more data is needed to reach a solid conclusion, our preliminary study of three

444

residential sub-sewersheds revealed a relationship between socioeconomic status and wastewater

445

PFAS: higher concentrations of PFAS are present in the wastewater originating from the more

446

affluent neighborhoods. Fluorosurfactants are much more expensive than analogous

447

hydrocarbon surfactants, with a price differential of up to 1000x on a mass basis.50 As such,

448

enabling products with PFAS instead of conventional hydrocarbon surfactants could

449

substantially raise product prices, thereby limiting affordability by low-income households.51

450

Since consumer products are a major source of PFAS,52 we hypothesize that the higher cost of

451

PFAS-containing consumer products plays a role in detecting higher PFAS concentrations in the

452

wastewater of more affluent neighborhoods. This hypothesis is further supported by the report

453

of higher PFAS concentrations in the serum of people with higher socioeconomic status.51, 53, 54

454
455

3.4. PFAS mass loading in household wastewater and correlation analysis

456

Based on the concentration of PFAS in the wastewater obtained from each residential sub-

457

sewershed and the average volume of wastewater generated by a household (630 L/day),55 we

458

estimated the mass loading of PFAS from an average household into the wastewater stream

459

(Figure 3f). The estimated PFAS mass loading of the households within the sub-sewershed of

460

Location A was 11.99 – 30.96 µg/household/day, while the mean and median were 18.22 ± 6.75

461

µg/household/day and 15.52 µg/household/day, respectively. The PFAS mass loading from

462

homes at Location B to the sewer system was slightly lower, 6.57 – 22.77 µg/household/day. The

463

mean and median PFAS contribution from the households within Location B’s sub-sewershed

464

were 10.73 ± 5.59 µg/household/day and 9.03 µg/household/day, respectively. The mass loading

465

of PFAS from the households served by the manhole at Location C was similarly lower than that

466

of Location A at 6.97 – 15.70 µg/household/day. Households around Location C have mean and

467

median PFAS contributions of 10.81 ± 2.87 µg/household/day and 10.25 µg/household/day,

468

respectively.

469
470

These variations in PFAS mass loadings across the three neighborhoods may be related to the

471

socioeconomic status of the residents, as discussed earlier. In addition, the diversity of the PFAS

472

types and concentrations in consumer products,4, 37 the differences in the amounts of consumer

473

products (e.g., soaps) used by individuals, and the variation in the pattern of wastewater

474

generation at residences could also contribute to the variation in the PFAS mass loading by

475

households/neighborhoods. In addition, interactions between PFAS and other wastewater

476

constituents, and differential interactions with the conveyance system could also introduce

477

variation in the PFAS mass loading in wastewater from different households or neighborhoods.56

478

Finally, performing typically commercial activities in residential areas (e.g., mobile car washes)

479

could also introduce spikes of certain PFAS to residential wastewater and substantially impact

480

mass loading.

481
482

The estimated household-level PFAS loading across the three residential sub-sewersheds

483

translates to 6.57 – 30.96 µg/household/day or 2.27 – 10.71 µg/capita/day, given California’s

484

average of 2.89 persons per household according to the US Census.57 Although several PFAS

485

mass loading/capita/day values have been reported in the literature, ours represents the first

486

estimates using wastewater obtained from upstream household discharge points with no

487

industrial contribution. It is, therefore, unsurprising that our estimate is somewhat lower than

488

most others, including that of Nguyen et al.58 (8.1 – 24 µg/capita/day for 12 PFAS, estimated

489

from the influents of 12 Australian WWTPs), Lin et al.29 (24 μg/capita/day, which was based on

490

the effluents of 6 WWTPs in the San Francisco Bay area), Gobelius et al.59 (43 µg/capita/day for

491

26 PFAS, which was based on the effluent of a Swedish WWTP), and Joo et al. 60 (6.9 – 14.12

Figure 4. Correlation between PFAS, metals, and other physicochemical properties of wastewater.

496
497

As shown in Figure 4, PFHxA and PFOA, commonly found in consumer products like toilet

498

paper and takeout containers,61-63 were positively correlated (r = 1, p < 0.05). In general, the C5

499

to C8 PFCAs (PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, and PFOA) were all strongly positively and significantly

500

correlated (r = 1, p < 0.05). Interestingly, while PFBA (a C4 PFCA) was only moderately (r =

501

0.05) and insignificantly (p > 0.05) correlated with each of the C5 to C8 analytes, its correlation

502

with the C9 and C10 homologs (PFNA and PFDA) was strong and significant (r = 1, p < 0.05).

503

Conversely, the correlation between PFBA and both PFUnA (a C11 PFCA) and PFTeDA (a C14

504

PFCA) was significantly negative (r = -1, p < 0.05). The PFCAs with backbone greater than C8

505

detected in the wastewater samples were all positively correlated with one another, except

506

PFUnA and PFTeDA, which were negatively correlated with other analytes in that category.

507

These relationships suggest that PFUnA and PFTeDA likely co-occur in certain consumer

508

products while the C5-C8 PFCAs co-occur in similar products. However, the possibility of these

509

correlations in wastewater originating from the similarity or differences in the environmental

510

fate of PFAS (e.g., transformation of long-chain PFCAs and precursors) cannot be ruled out.

511
512

As for the PFSAs, we observed a significant positive correlation (r = 1, p < 0.05) between the

513

long-chain analytes, PFNS (C9 PFSA) and PFDS (C10 PFSA). Similarly, PFBS and PFHxS (C4

514

and C6 homologs, respectively), were positively and significantly correlated (r = 1, p < 0.05). In

515

contrast, PFOS was significantly negatively correlated with PFHpS (r = -1, p < 0.05). The

516

correlations among the other PFSAs detected in the household wastewater samples were

517

moderate (i.e., r ≈ 0.5) and/or insignificant. For instance, PFOS’ correlation with each of PFBS

518

and PFHxS was positive (r = 0.5) but negative for each of PFNS and PFDS (r = -0.5). In all these

519

cases, the correlations were insignificant (p > 0.05). The full discussions of the correlation

520

analysis are provided in SI Section S6.

521

3.5. Environmental implications and limitations

523

The consistent detection of various PFAS in household wastewater, irrespective of the

524

socioeconomic status of the neighborhood, indicates that household products are an important
27

525

source of these persistent chemicals. An implication of PFAS’ consistent occurrence in

526

household wastewater is that WWTPs will always have a certain level of PFAS (baseline) in

527

their influent even if all PFAS contributions by industry are eliminated. The baseline PFAS

528

contributed by residential sources could challenge the ability of WWTPs to meet future

529

regulatory limits, given the inefficiency of conventional treatment processes in removing PFAS.

530

The prevalence of PFAS in residential wastewater also suggests that they will continue to be

531

released into the environment through treated effluent and sludge. Since WWTPs cannot regulate

532

discharges from households, policies on the nonessential uses of PFAS in consumer products

533

and engineering approaches to remove PFAS from household wastewater are needed.

534
535

This study has some limitations: Although each residential sub-sewershed sampled included

536

hundreds of homes, which increased the representativeness of the obtained samples, the overall

537

number of sub-sewersheds sampled is low and warrants future larger-scale studies. Also, there

538

is a need for future studies to consider sampling residences other than single-family homes, such

539

as apartments, dormitories, and rural communities, to have a more holistic view of household

540

PFAS discharge. Another limitation is the adoption of targeted PFAS analysis (EPA Method

541

1633), which, although is robust, may still overlook some analytes and precursors. Lastly, since

542

plastic containers differentially adsorb to specific PFAS,44 some compounds in the wastewater

543

samples at low concentrations may have been underreported.
