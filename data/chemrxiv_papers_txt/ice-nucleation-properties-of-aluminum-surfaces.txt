Abstract
The nucleation of ice from supercooled water droplets plays a critical role across various
technological sectors including aviation, power transmission, shipping and space flight. Despite
its importance, the fundamental mechanisms of water freezing on surfaces remain poorly
understood. In this study, we investigate the freezing behavior of supercooled droplets on several
aluminum alloys (1050, 5083, 5251, 6060 and 6082) using our custom-designed IceBox
instrument. Our findings show that all aluminum surfaces exhibit moderate ice-nucleating
capabilities. High levels of surface oxidation and magnesium content lead to higher average icenucleation temperatures, and rough surfaces generally promote ice formation more effectively than
polished ones. An exception is the freshly polished 1050 alloy, the softest and purest aluminum
examined, where micrometer-scale “pit” features appear to initiate ice nucleation. After surface
aging, the 5251 alloy displays the highest ice-nucleating ability, while the 6082 alloy shows the
lowest. Overall, our results highlight the importance of considering the interplay between surface
roughness, specific defects and alloy composition when aiming to reduce ice formation on
aluminum surfaces.

Introduction
Water can remain liquid well below its freezing point for extended periods of time. Under rapid
cooling conditions, freezing temperatures as low as –46 °C have been reported.1 Even at such low
temperatures, ice nucleation may not occur homogeneously but can instead be triggered by the
surfaces of the water droplets.2 At higher temperatures, ice typically nucleates heterogeneously at
the interface between liquid water and solid particles or surfaces. For effective nucleation to occur,
the ice-nucleating surface must be large enough to support the formation of a critical ice nucleus.35

Notable examples of efficient ice nucleators include silver halides6-8 and biological particles

originating from Pseudomonas syringae bacteria.9-12 Heterogeneous ice nucleation plays a critical
role in diverse fields, including climate science, biology, aviation, space flight, food industry and
the cryopreservation biological materials.13-19
Computational studies have played a crucial role in uncovering the molecular-scale
mechanisms underlying ice nucleation.12, 20-23 Experimentally, one of the main challenges in
studying ice nucleation lies in the fact that only a few active sites on a surface may trigger
nucleation, and these sites often have structures that do not necessarily reflect the bulk properties
of the material.24-27 Despite recent advances, the fundamental question of what drives water to
freeze remains incompletely understood.28
Aluminum surfaces are widely used across numerous industries, including aviation,
automotive, construction, shipping and space flight. Wrought aluminum alloys are commonly
identified by a four-digit code, where the first digit denotes the principal alloying element, except
in the case of the 1xxx series, which defines pure aluminum with a minimum purity of 99%.29 The
second digit (if not zero) indicates a variation of the original alloy, while the last two digits specify
the particular alloy within that series.
When exposed to air, aluminum reacts rapidly with oxygen to form a surface layer of
aluminum oxide.30, 31 This process begins with the formation of an amorphous precursor,
eventually yielding a γ-Al₂O₃ layer.32 In the context of ice nucleation, nine different aluminum
oxides have been evaluated using immersion freezing experiments. Among them, corundum (αalumina) was identified as the most effective ice-nucleating Al₂O₃ material.33 Computational
studies attribute this to the favorable lattice match between the hexagonal structure of α-alumina
and that of ice.34 Investigations into the pH dependence of ice nucleation showed that the αalumina (0001) surface exhibited the highest freezing temperatures at neutral pH.35 Classical

molecular dynamics simulations suggest this is due to the presence of mono-protonated OH groups
at neutral pH, which are particularly effective at promoting ice-like structuring of the water at the
interface.36 On the other hand, the freezing temperatures of supercooled KCl solutions on 1050
aluminum surfaces were found to be only minimally influenced by pH.37 Alumina nanoparticles
have also been employed as model systems for atmospheric mineral dust.38 Additionally,
aluminum surfaces are widely used as substrates for the development of icephobic coatings.39-41
In this study, we examine the ice-nucleation properties of a selection of commercially
available aluminum alloys. These include nearly pure aluminum (1050), aluminum primarily
alloyed with magnesium (5083 and 5251), and alloys from the 6xxx series, where aluminum is
combined with both magnesium and silicon (6060 and 6082). To perform the ice-nucleation
experiments, we designed a custom instrument, the IceBox, to monitor the supercooling and
freezing of 7×7 arrays of water droplets as the aluminum surfaces are cooled. Both rough and
polished surfaces are characterized using high-resolution optical microscopy with the digital depth
composition function, providing detailed surface roughness parameters. Elemental surface
compositions are determined with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Finally, the effects of
surface roughness, chemical composition and aging are correlated with the observed ice-nucleation
behaviors.
Experimental section
Aluminum samples
Aluminum sheets with a thickness of 6 mm were obtained from commercial suppliers including
the 1050, 5083, 5251, 6060 and 6082 alloys. The nominal elemental compositions of these alloys
are provided in Table 1.29 From each sheet, 40 × 40 mm squares were cut, and a 3 mm-diameter
hole with a depth of 25 mm was drilled near one of the edges to accommodate a temperature sensor.

Preparation of the aluminum surfaces
To prepare rough surfaces, the aluminum sheets were sanded with a grade P100 sandpaper. The
surfaces were then rinsed with isopropanol to remove any contaminants. Isopropanol was chosen
as a cleaning solvent due to its well-known ability to evaporate quickly at room temperature
without leaving residues.
To achieve smooth surfaces, the aluminum samples were initially sanded with P100
sandpaper, followed by P400 sandpaper, to remove any visible deep scratches, and then P800
sandpaper. After this, the surfaces were cleaned with Cif cream cleaner, rinsed with water, and
sanded using P1000 and P4000 sandpapers. Finally, the surfaces were polished using a soft cloth
and Brasso metal polish, and rinsed with isopropanol to remove residual polish.
Optical digital microscopy
A Keyence VHX-970F optical microscope was used for determining the surface roughness of the
different samples using 5000-fold magnification with a VH-Z500T objective and the fine-depth
composition function of the microscope software. At this magnification, areas of 2913 µm2 were
captured. Out-of-focus distances were defined manually well above and below the surfaces, and a
stack of 200 images was then automatically collected between the two extremes. The software of
the microscope was then used to reconstruct a 3D model of the surface and to calculate various
characteristics of the surface roughness. Measurements were taken at ten random locations across
each of the surfaces including the rough and polished surfaces.

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)
Approximately two months after the preparation of the polished surfaces, the chemical surface
compositions were determined using a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) module of
a Keyence VHX-7000 microscope.
Ice nucleation experiments
The ice nucleation experiments were conducted with our IceBox instrument which was designed
and built by us for this study. A schematic cross-section of its main unit is shown in Figure 1(a)
and a top-view photographic image in Figure 1(b). The IceBox consists of a (1) cylindrical housing
which was 3D-printed using white tough PLA (150 mm diameter, 130 mm height). A (2) lid with
an opening for a (3) USB document camera and three holders for (4) white LED backlight modules
(Pimoroni, 3 V, 38.7 mm × 11.9 mm) was 3D printed using black tough PLA for the inside and
white PLA for the outside surfaces. The LED backlight modules were oriented so that the light
reflected from the white internal walls of the housing and operated with a power supply. At the
bottom of the IceBox, a (5) copper heat exchanger (Laird Technologies Liquid Heat Exchanger,
12.7 × 57 × 51 mm) was firmly attached to a small stage with two M3 bolts and nuts. A (6) circular
floor was CNC-milled from a 3 mm thick Perspex sheet containing a rectangular opening with
steps so that the Perspex sheet can rest on the edges of the heat exchanger while still exposing
most of its upper copper surface. Several 3 mm diameter holes were drilled into the Perspex sheet
surrounding the heat exchanger. Once installed, the small gap between the Perspex floor and the
housing was filled with silicone. A (7) Peltier element (RS Components, 82.1 W, 8.4 A, 15.7 V,
40 × 40 mm) was then firmly attached to the heat exchanger using small amounts of heatconducting paste and ensuring that its hot side was in contact with the heat exchanger. One of the
various (8) aluminum squares was then attached to the upper side of the Peltier element again using
small amounts of heat-conducting paste. A (9) Pt100 temperature sensor (RS PRO Pt100 RTD
probe, 2.8 mm diameter, 25 mm long, Class A) in 4-wire configuration was inserted sideways into
the hole of the aluminum sample using heat-conducting paste to achieve good thermal contact. On
top of the aluminum surface, a (10) 2 mm high, black 3D-printed PLA grid was placed with 7×7
compartments. Into the compartments, an (11) array of 49 Milli-Q water droplets with volumes of
1 µL was pipetted. The purpose of the grid was to prevent any potential interactions between

neighboring droplets of water either through Ostwald ripening when liquid or through ejecta from
freezing droplets causing the nucleation of neighboring droplets.42, 43

aluminum surfaces. (a) Schematic cross-section of the IceBox and (b) top-view photographic

the legend. (c) Fraction-frozen curves obtained from three independent cooling experiments at 1
°C min-1 with 49 water droplets (1 µL) placed on Vaseline-coated aluminum surfaces.

The IceBox also hosts a (12) humidity sensor (Adafruit, SHT30, enclosed shell) attached to the
Perspex floor. The (5) heat exchanger was connected to (13) coolant from a Julabo F1000
thermoregulation system operating at 10 °C. Using a (14) push fitting at the bottom of the IceBox,
its internal volume was purged with dry argon gas. An argon flow rate of 0.8 L min-1 was used
during the ice nucleation experiments.
The Perspex floor at the height level just below the array of water droplets ensured that the
lower compartment of the IceBox was always fully filled with dry argon even when the top lid
was taken off for pipetting the water droplets onto the aluminum surfaces. This meant that the
humidity at the height level of the water droplets could be reduced very quickly. The condensation
of frost due to high humidity levels needed to be strictly avoided since this would lead to immediate
ice nucleation of the supercooled water droplets.44 Several (15) holes in the top lid ensured a
constant flow of dry argon gas through the IceBox from the bottom towards the top.

Various electronic components were housed in a separate box. These included a
microcontroller (Adafruit Feather 32u4 Basic Proto) connected to an Adafruit Pt100 RTD
temperature sensor amplifier. The humidity sensor was connected directly to the microcontroller
whereas the four wires from the Pt100 sensor inside the main unit were connected to the amplifier.
The code for the microcontroller was written so that it interrogates the temperature of the Pt100
sensor and the humidity, and, for convenience, both values were displayed at the front of the
electronics box using two LED displays. The microcontroller was also connected to a Windows
computer via its USB port.
On the computer, a LabView program was designed which requested both the temperature
and humidity from the microcontroller. Within the program, a cooling ramp could be defined in
terms of start and end temperature as well as cooling rate. The USB port of the computer was
connected to the RS232 port of a power supply (RS PRO Digital Bench Power Supply, 20 V DC,
10 A, 200 W) using an USB to RS232 converter, and the terminals of the power supply were
connected to the Peltier element inside the IceBox. Using a PID algorithm, the LabView program
could then set the voltage of the Peltier element so that the defined cooling ramp was followed.
The temperatures during a typical cooling experiment from +5 to –30 °C at 1 °C min-1 are shown
in Figure S1.
Additionally, the LabView program takes images of the array of droplets on the sample stage
using the USB document camera at one second intervals during cooling. The current temperature
was written at the top left-hand corner of every image. The polished aluminum surfaces were
highly reflective which represented a challenge when trying to capture images from directly above.
The glare was minimized by bouncing the LED light off the white wall of the container and by
using black PLA for the underside of the top lid. The freezing of the water droplets goes along
with a visible change in the appearance of the droplets from transparent to white as well as changes
in shape as shown in Figure S2. The temperatures of the various freezing events were determined
by scrolling through the stack of recorded images. Whenever the freezing of a droplet was
observed, the temperature was noted, and a small bead of blue tack was attached to the computer
screen on top of the frozen droplet so that it was easier to keep an eye on the still liquid droplets.
Once all droplets had frozen, the list of freezing temperatures was used to obtain fraction-frozen
curves as they are shown, for example, in Figure 1(c).

The fraction-frozen curves in Figure 1(c) were obtained after applying a thin layer of
Vaseline petroleum jelly onto an aluminum surfaces before pipetting the array of 1 µL Milli-Q
water droplets. The hydrophobic Vaseline is known to exhibit poor ice-nucleation properties.45-47
There was consistent freezing behavior for the three experiments illustrating reproducibility. The
average temperature at which half of the droplets were frozen, T1/2, was −23.39 ± 0.18 °C for a
cooling rate of 1 °C min-1. This T1/2 value represents a baseline value for our setup. Any surface
with ice-nucleation abilities is expected to show a more positive T1/2 value.
To test the accuracy of the temperature measurements, arrays of frozen water droplets were
heated from –30 to +5 °C at 0.5 °C min-1. Melting was observed consistently between 0.09 and
0.12 °C which was considered close enough to 0 °C so that no temperature corrections were
performed. Furthermore, the melting was observed to be instantaneous across the entire surface
illustrating that no thermal gradients are present across the sample stage.
All ice-nucleation experiments using the different aluminum surfaces were repeated at least
three times. Fresh surfaces were prepared for every single experiment including for studies
investigating the effects of surface aging. For aging the surfaces, the samples were stored in plastic
boxes for up to 50 days to ensure that the surfaces stayed clean. Overall, 137 individual icenucleation experiments were performed for this study.
Results and Discussion
The as-prepared aluminum surfaces were first characterized with high-resolution optical
microscopy. Representative images using 5000-fold magnification are shown in Figure 1. The
polished surfaces showed flat areas with thin crisscrossing lines as well as a few dark patches. The
polished 1050 surfaces displayed more of the dark defect features compared to the other polished
surfaces. The 1050 alloy is the purest out of all the investigated alloys and hence also the softest.29
As expected, the rough surfaces displayed significant and heavily overlapping scratches along
random directions. No obvious visual differences could be seen comparing the different rough
surfaces.

Figure 2. (double column) Optical-microscopy images of the as-prepared polished and rough
aluminum surfaces recorded at 5000-fold magnification.

Stacks of 200 images were recorded as a function of height around the focal distance of a given
location on one of the aluminum surfaces using the fine-depth composition function of our digital
microscope. From such a set of images, the software of the microscope constructed threedimensional representations of the surfaces. Figure 3 shows two examples of three-dimensional
surface structures of (a) polished and (b) rough 1050 surfaces. As expected, the polished surface
is much smoother compared to the rough surface. Also, using this type of three-dimensional
analysis, it could be clarified that the dark features on the polished surfaces observed in Figure 2
are in fact “pits” with diameters around 5 µm and depths in the 1 to 2 µm range. One such pit is
highlighted by the red arrow in Figure 3(a).

1050 aluminum surfaces. The height information is indicated by the rainbow-color gradient. The
red arrow in (a) indicates the location of a “pit” feature.

From the three-dimensional information, various surface-roughness parameters were calculated.
The most basic quantity is the surface roughness Sa, which reflects the average absolute height
deviation from the mean surface plane. The average Sa values from ten different locations on the
different aluminum substrates are shown in Figure 4(a). The polished surfaces show Sa values
around 0.2 µm with small spatial variations as indicated by the small vertical bars. The rough
surfaces on the other hand showed larger Sa values around 1 µm and pronounced spatial variations
across a given surface.

aluminum surfaces including (a) surface roughness Sa, (b) kurtosis Sku and (c) skewness Ssk (see
text for definitions). The vertical bars in this figure indicate the spatial variations across the
surfaces in question.

The roughness analysis also gives the kurtosis of the height distributions, Sku, as shown in Figure
4(b). The kurtosis is a measure for the sharpness of the height distribution where a value of 3
(mesokurtic) indicates a normal height distribution. Sku values greater than 3 (leptokurtic) indicate
more tall peaks and deep valleys whereas Sku values less than 3 (platykurtic) imply fewer tall peaks
and deep valleys than expected from a normal height distribution. On average, the rough surfaces
can be classified as mesokurtic with Sku = 3. This means that the average height distributions follow
a normal distribution. The polished surfaces on the other hand are leptokurtic, i.e. Sku > 3, which
implies that the surfaces exhibit more tall and deep features than expected from a normal height
distribution. This finding makes sense since our polishing procedure can be expected to remove
smaller height variations preferentially.

The final parameter obtained from the roughness analysis is the skewness of the height
distributions, Ssk. A skewness of zero means that the height distribution is symmetrical with respect
to the mean plane. Positive and negative values indicate that the height distributions are skewed
below or above the mean plane, respectively. As shown in Figure 4(c), the rough surfaces display
average Ssk values around zero which means that the height distributions are symmetric with
respect to the mean plane. This is expected for mesokurtic height distributions. For the polished
surfaces, differences are observed between the 1050 alloy and the others. The 1050 alloy shows
Ssk < 0 which means that the height distribution is skewed above the mean plane. This means that
fewer peaks are present than deep surface features. This finding is consistent with the frequently
observed pit structures on the polished 1050 surfaces. The other alloys show the opposite behavior
for polished surfaces with Ssk > 0 indicating a prevalence of taller features.
In a next step, the ice-nucleation properties of the different as-prepared surfaces were
investigated using our IceBox instrument. Fraction-frozen curves were obtained by cooling arrays
of 49 one-microliter droplets of MilliQ water on the various aluminum surfaces at 1 °C min-1.
Figure 5 shows the combined fraction-frozen curves from at least three separate experiments for
the polished and rough surfaces including the (a) 1050, (b) 5083, (c) 5251, (d) 6060 and (e) 6082
alloys. For comparison, the fraction-frozen curves of one-microliter water droplets on Vaseline are
included in Figure 5. For all fraction-frozen curves, the temperatures at which half of the droplets
were frozen, T1/2, are indicated by dashed vertical lines. The shaded areas indicate the margins of
error of the T1/2 values.

All aluminum surfaces display more positive T1/2 values compared to the Vaseline experiment

5251 surfaces. This means a temperature shift of 3.77 ± 0.81 °C. The trend for the 5083, 5251,
6060, and 6082 alloys is that the T1/2 values of the rough surfaces are more positive than the
corresponding polished surfaces. This can be attributed to the larger effective surface areas of the
rough surfaces and potentially more active ice-nucleation sites, for example, in steep valleys.
Computational studies have shown that concave wedge structures in particular with opening angles
around 45° can promote ice nucleation.42 On the other hand, rough glass, silicon and mica surfaces
were found to display very similar ice-properties compared to the corresponding smooth
surfaces.48 It seems therefore as if the effects of surface roughness on ice nucleation may differ
strongly from one material to the next.
Surprisingly, for the 1050 alloy, the T1/2 of the polished surface (−19.59 ± 0.45 °C) is more
positive than the T1/2 of the corresponding rough surface (−20.84 ± 0.3 °C). As mentioned earlier,
the polished 1050 surfaces showed more pit structures than the other polished surfaces resulting
in a negative Ssk value. It therefore seems likely that the higher T1/2 value of the polished 1050
surfaces is due to the frequent pit structures.
Apart from the polished 1050 surfaces, it is a curious observation that all the other fractionfrozen curves reach complete crystallization at approximately the T1/2 value of the Vaseline
surface. This means that the crystallization temperature of the last droplets to freeze on these
aluminum surfaces is about the same as the average freezing temperature of water droplets on the
nominally inactive Vaseline surface.
Aluminum surfaces are known to quickly self-passivate forming layers of Al2O3. Even with
partial pressures of oxygen below 10-5 torr, Al2O3 layers with thicknesses in the nanometer range
were found to form within several hundred seconds.30 The limiting thickness of the Al2O3 films is
reached quickly at partial pressures of oxygen of 1 torr following the Cabrera Mott kinetic model
of low-temperature metal-oxide growth.31 Increasing the oxygen partial pressure above 1 torr has
been shown to have no additional effect on the film thickness.31 The structure of Al2O3 formed by
surface oxidation of aluminum is typically -Al2O3.32 Taking these experimental observations into
account, all our aluminum surfaces are expected to be completely covered by layers of Al2O3
before the ice nucleation experiments are conducted. The thicknesses of the Al2O3 layer on
aluminum surfaces are typically in the 2 – 4 nm range.49, 50
To investigate the surface compositions of our samples in more detail, the polished surfaces
were investigated with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Following an intense blast

with a high-energy laser, the elemental composition is determined from the gas-phase atomic
emission spectrum.51 The average elemental compositions from 25 different locations on each of
the surfaces are shown in Figure 6. All aluminum surfaces showed the presence of oxygen as
expected from the presence of the Al2O3 layers. The largest variations with respect to the oxygen
content were found within the 5xxx alloys with the 5251 being most oxidized and the 5083 the
least. All surfaces of the 5xxx and 6xxx alloys showed magnesium and small amounts of silicon
(see Table 1 for nominal bulk compositions). Alloys in the 6xxx series on the other hand contain
similar amounts of magnesium and silicon. Our LIBS measurements therefore indicate that
magnesium is enriched to a greater extent at the surfaces compared to silicon. The largest
percentage of magnesium is found for the 5251 alloy which is also the most oxidized surface.
Ignoring the unusual case of the polished 1050 surface, the most positive T1/2 values for both the
polished and rough surfaces were found for the 5251 alloy. This suggests a correlation between
ice-nucleation ability of aluminum surfaces and their oxygen / magnesium contents at the surface.

In a final step, the effects of surface aging on the ice-nucleation properties of the aluminum
surfaces were investigated. Figure 7 shows how T1/2 changes as a function of the aging time of the
(a) polished and (b) rough surfaces for time periods up to 51 days. At least three freezing
experiments were conducted for a given aging time. All surfaces were only used once for a freezing
experiment following a given ageing time.

Figure 7. (single column) Effects of surface aging on the ice-nucleation properties of the various
aluminum alloys as indicated in the legend with (a) polished and (b) rough surfaces. T1/2 reflects
the temperature at which half of the droplets were frozen upon cooling at 1 °C min-1. The dashed
grey lines indicate the T1/2 values of water droplets on Vaseline-coated surfaces. The error bars
reflect the standard deviations calculated from at least three independent experiments.
Overall, the changes in T1/2 as a function of aging time were quite small. For the polished surfaces,
statistically significant decreases in T1/2 upon aging were observed for the 1050 and 5083 alloys.
Interestingly, surface aging removes the unusually high T1/2 value of the freshly prepared polished
1050 surfaces. Upon investigating aged 1050 surfaces with optical microscopy, a slightly positive
Ssk skewness of 0.105 ± 0.560 was obtained. The negative Ssk values of the freshly prepared 1050
polished surfaces were earlier attributed to the frequent “pit” features. Surface aging therefore
seems to decrease the depths of these features possibly through the formation of thicker Al2O3
layers at the bottoms and walls of the pits, and this process could be origin of the decreased icenucleation properties. The rough surfaces did not show any statistically significant changes of T1/2
upon surface ageing.

The general trend after extended surface aging is that all rough surfaces show more positive
T1/2 values compared to their polished counterparts. The aged 5251 surfaces are overall the most
ice-nucleating surfaces and the aged 6082 surfaces the least.
Conclusions
Aluminum surfaces were found to exhibit moderate ice-nucleation capabilities. An increased
degree of surface oxidation and/or higher magnesium content was associated with elevated average
ice-nucleation temperatures. In general, rough surfaces promoted ice nucleation more effectively
than polished ones. A notable exception was the freshly polished 1050 alloy, the softest aluminum
studied, where distinctive pit features, approximately 5 µm in diameter and 1–2 µm deep, appeared
to serve as active sites for ice nucleation. Similar nucleating pits have previously been identified
on feldspar surfaces.25 Over time, surface aging reduced the activity of these pit features. For the
aged surfaces, the 5251 alloy showed the highest ice-nucleation efficiency, while the 6082 alloy
exhibited the weakest performance. Future research may focus on deliberately engineering pit
structures with optimized dimensions to prolong their activity and enhance ice-nucleation
performance.
