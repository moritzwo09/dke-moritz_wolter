Abstract
Recovering nitrogen (N) from wastewater is a potential avenue to reduce reliance on energy-

3

intensive synthetic nitrogen fixation via Haber-Bosch and subsequent treatment of N-laden wastewaters

4

through nitrification-denitrification. However, many technical and economic factors hinder widespread

5

application of N recovery, particularly low N concentrations in municipal wastewater, paucity of high-

6

efficiency separations technologies compatible with biological treatment, and suitable products and

7

markets for recovered N. In this perspective, we contextualize the challenges of N recovery today,

8

propose integrated biological and physicochemical technologies to improve selective and tunable N

9

recovery, and propose an expanded product portfolio for recovered N products beyond fertilizers. We

10

highlight cyanophycin, an N-rich biopolymer produced by a diverse range of bacteria, as a potential target

11

for N bioconcentration and downstream recovery from municipal wastewater. This perspective

12

emphasizes the equal importance of integrated biological systems, physicochemical separations, and

13

market assessment in advancing nitrogen recovery from wastewater.

Introduction

16

Nitrogen (N) transformation through the Haber-Bosch process propelled the Green Revolution

17

through production of nitrogen fertilizers but created ongoing environmental challenges from fertilizer

18

runoff and N-rich wastewaters. N-rich waste streams are produced in enormous quantities in both urban

19

systems (municipal and industrial wastewater, food waste) and agriculture (manure, fertilizer runoff)

20

settings (a combined 109-1016 L/year).1 In current practice, N-rich wastewaters undergo energy intensive

21

treatment that results in dissipation of N into N2 or N2O, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) (Figure 1). Shifting

22

the paradigm of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from nitrogen removal to nitrogen recovery can

23

reduce dependence on Haber-Bosch, generate N-rich products, and promote a circular nitrogen economy.

26

Recent efforts have aimed to transition from removing N to upcycling N from wastewaters as a

27

concentrated fertilizer that offsets fertilizer made by the Haber-Bosch process with its intensive energy use

28

and CO2 emissions.2 However, the low price of commodity fertilizers3 coupled to high cost and energy use

29

of current fertilizer recovery approaches pose crucial barriers to economical N recovery.4 Biological and

30

physicochemical unit processes are widely used for N removal in wastewater treatment but are separated

31

due to differences in operating conditions and the independent optimization of processes.5 There is a

32

comparative lack of research on integrated biological-physicochemical processes for N recovery,

33

highlighting the need for low-energy, cost-effective approaches for sustainable N recovery from wastewater

34

and conversion into valuable products. In this perspective, we identify the context and challenges of N

35

recovery, propose integrated biological and physicochemical technologies to improve selective N recovery,

36

and expand the product portfolio for N recovery outside of fertilizers.

38

N recovery from wastewater: context, challenges, and roadmap

39

N management practices at WWTPs are largely focused on N removal rather than recovery (Figure

40

1). Standard practice for N removal, biological nitrification-denitrification (NDN), converts influent

41

ammonia into N2 gas. NDN can facilitate N recovery through land application of biosolids; however, at

42

least 80% of influent N is dissipated rather than recovered in biosolids.6 Successful NDN opposes other

43

recovery goals (i.e. biogas production from anaerobic digestion) because reducing equivalents for

44

denitrification come from organic C in influent wastewater or from an external source such as methanol.

45

Furthermore, NDN produces N2O as an unintended byproduct. N2O has 300 times the global warming

46

potential of CO2, and wastewater treatment alone accounts for 5% of all N2O emissions in the US.7 NDN

47

also requires aeration accounting for well over 50% of electricity use at WWTPs.8 Newer biotechnologies

48

such as anammox processes can significantly reduce electricity and C demands but still target N dissipation

49

rather than recovery.

50

Advancing beyond NDN will facilitate greater N recovery, but an unavoidable challenge to N

51

recovery will still remain: the relatively dilute concentrations of N in municipal wastewater, typically

52

between ~20-40 mg N/L.8 Electrochemical and membrane separations can achieve efficient and selective

53

N recovery with high strength, low volume streams such as anaerobic digester centrate and source-separated

54

urine, with typical concentrations above 1000 mg N/L.9 New biotechnologies show great promise to bridge

55

the gap between existing systems and emerging N recovery technologies through the Partition-Release-

56

Recovery (PRR) approach: sequestering dilute mainstream N into concentrated sidestreams that can be

57

transformed into a variety of endproducts.10 Biological approaches to N concentration offer advantages over

58

physicochemical concentration methods, including high affinity to low substrate concentrations and

59

suitability in ambient temperature and pressure. The PRR approach is already employed in P and C recovery

60

biotechnologies, particularly in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and high rate activated

61

sludge (HRAS), which can serve as roadmaps for N recovery.

62

P recovery from municipal wastewater is enabled by phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs),

63

which convert soluble phosphate to intracellular polyphosphate under cyclic redox conditions (partition).

64

The P-rich biomass is then diverted to the sidestream. Under anaerobic conditions, soluble P can be released

65

from PAOs back into solution (release), and the P-rich liquid solution can be used as a feedstock for struvite

66

(MgNH4PO4⋅6H2O) production (recovery) with end products including fertilizer and flame retardant.8,11 P

67

partitioning by PAOs is standard practice for removing P from wastewater. Furthermore, P release under

68

controlled conditions mitigates nuisance struvite build-up in pipes and equipment. For C recovery, the

69

HRAS process follows a similar PRR framework; fast-growing microbes incorporate a majority of influent

70

carbon into biomass (partition) which is directed to anaerobic digesters for hydrolysis (release) and

71

conversion to methane for energy and heat generation (recovery).12 C recovery via biogas generation works

72

in tandem with sludge stabilization, the process of reducing sludge volume and minimizing odor and

73

pathogens.

74

These examples of PRR pathways for P and C recovery are mature technologies and are far more

75

developed than N recovery, in part due to their compatibility and co-benefits with other treatment and

76

operations goals. Given that wastewater practitioners prioritize cost, effluent concentration, and removal

77

efficiencies in their technology decisions13, N bioconcentration technologies should be developed with

78

these priorities at the forefront.

79
80

In Pursuit of Nitrogen Accumulating Organisms

81

N bioconcentration may incidentally occur in existing processes but is not the primary goal. HRAS

82

can facilitate partial N recovery through assimilation or adsorption to biomass. However, N capture in

83

HRAS is associated with longer solids retention time (SRT), which opposes C recovery goals; HRAS may

84

capture up to 50% of influent N at SRT between 1.5-3 days, but methane production from HRAS biomass

85

is often optimized for SRT below 1 day.14 Furthermore, HRAS systems typically require additional

86

processes to manage downstream N and P to meet effluent discharge limits. Algae and mixed algae-bacteria

87

systems can also assimilate N, but similar to HRAS, maximizing N recovery in algal systems is at odds

88

with other resource recovery goals, namely maximizing total algal biomass yield.15 Furthermore, algal

89

systems face significant challenges in scale-up for optimal light exposure, efficient biomass separations,

90

and product extraction16.

91

An emerging method for N bioconcentration is intracellular biopolymer accumulation in activated

92

sludge, analogous to P accumulation by PAOs. A leading but underexplored candidate biopolymer is

93

cyanophycin, which consists of an aspartate backbone and arginine or lysine residues. Cyanophycin has a

94

relatively high N content (approximately 10:5 C/N ratio on a molar basis) and is selectively soluble as a

6

95

function of pH.17 A diverse range of phototrophs, mixotrophs, and heterotrophs have cyanophycin

96

accumulation and degradation metabolisms.18,19 Surprisingly, cyanophycin metabolism genes have recently

97

been found in important genomes or metagenome assembled genomes of a broad range of microbes

98

commonly present in existing biological nutrient removal processes, including PAOs Ca. Accumulibacter,

99

Tetrasphaera, and Dechloromonas20,21 as well as nitrifiers Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira19, and gene

100

expression of cyanophycin synthetase has also been demonstrated in Ca. Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera.

101

20

102

Moreover, cyanophycin has been measured at 124 mg/g mixed liquor suspended solids in a mixed

103

algal-bacterial system designed for cyanophycin production (achieving ~50% total N removal and ~90%

104

total P removal)22, and over 100 mg/g dry weight in full-scale activated sludge facilities designed for

105

conventional N and P removal (achieving <10 mg/L total N and <0.5 mg/L total P).23 Both of these systems

106

have cyanophycin yields comparable to 10-20% cell dry weight from a cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp.

107

PCC6803.24 These early studies highlight the unexpected diversity and prevalence of taxa putatively

108

capable of cyanophycin metabolisms, and suggest that N bioconcentration (partitioning) via cyanophycin

109

can occur in tandem with other treatment goals. While additional research is needed, these studies also point

110

to cyanophycin as a possible basis for a long missing “nitrogen accumulating organism” that may provide

111

the foundation for N recovery in a PRR framework—potentially using existing process infrastructure.

112

Cyanophycin accumulation and production in existing systems should be investigated in tandem with

113

efficient separations processes to rapidly advance this nascent method for N bioconcentration and recovery

114

from wastewater.

115
116

Exploiting Synergies between Biological and Physicochemical/Electrochemical Techniques to

117

Advance N Recovery

118

Increased interest in N recovery from waste streams has advanced physicochemical techniques that

119

separate N at various stages of wastewater treatment. A novel PRR approach to N recovery will require

120

product separation after bioconcentration and can integrate existing physicochemical techniques.

121

Established physicochemical techniques for N recovery include air stripping, membrane filtration,

122

adsorption, and struvite precipitation.25 While promising, these approaches alone can be energy-intensive,

123

costly, and often require pretreatment or highly concentrated waste streams.4 However, combining

124

biological and physicochemical techniques offers attractive options to circumvent the N recovery

125

challenges faced by both techniques. This integrated biological and physicochemical approach has proven

126

useful for emerging technologies for the goal of N removal. For example, the low ammonium concentration

127

and slow growth of anammox bacteria limit mainstream application of anammox for N removal.26 However,

128

when incorporated with zeolite-coated ion exchange (IX) membranes, the growth of anammox bacteria

129

improves due to cation exchange and ammonium adsorption, resulting in an enhanced average total nitrogen

130

removal of 73%.27 Similarly, several approaches to combining biological and polymeric membrane

131

filtration materials have shown promise to advance energy-efficient N removal, increase oxygen utilization

132

efficiency, and overcome competing growth with heterotrophs in environments with abundant

133

biodegradable C. Of these technologies, the membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) stands out due to

134

its high effluent quality, carbon processing efficiency, and high nitrification rate (1-3 g N/m2-d).28 Further

135

exploration into bio-based polymeric materials can improve selectivity for target ions, decrease dependence

136

on fossil fuels, and advance a bioeconomy by utilizing biomass.29

137

We suggest that a similar approach to exploiting synergies between biological (e.g. cyanophcyin

138

accumulation) and physicochemical technologies is needed to advance the goal of N recovery, rather than

139

N removal. In the case of cyanophycin, selective large-scale recovery from microbial biomass after

140

bioconcentration and sidestream diversion may be limited by laborious pH cycling that requires multiple

141

chemical inputs.30 Improving the intrinsic N-selectivity of physicochemical techniques can also work in

142

tandem with P removal to advance nutrient recovery technologies. For example, simultaneous recovery of

143

NH4+ and PO43- from wastewater via struvite precipitation often follows diversion of PAO rich biomass to

144

the sidestream in biological phosphorus removal processes31, but faces limitations in terms of N recovery

145

from dilute wastewaters. Struvite precipitation separates equimolar NH4+ and PO43-, but the molar ratio of

146

N:P often exceeds 5 in municipal wastewater, leading to reduced N removal efficiency.32 Integrating PAOs

147

or cyanophycin with ion exchange materials could enhance the efficiency for nutrient recovery by

148

leveraging the specific binding affinities of these biomolecules for phosphorus and nitrogen compounds.

149

Alternatively, electrochemical techniques can utilize renewable energy to valorize solutes through

150

electrocatalysis, stoichiometric electrochemical conversions, and electrochemical separations.1 Broader

151

electrochemical and electrokinetic techniques have successfully removed both ammonia and ammonium

152

from fertilizer effluent, municipal wastewater, and food waste digestate with upwards of 93% recovery

153

efficiency.33 However, due to the instability of reactive inorganic nitrogen intermediates, further exploration

154

into electrocatalytic separations is required to expand the N portfolio. Microbial electrochemical systems

155

(MECs) and biocatalysts are technologies that integrate biological and electrochemical techniques into a

156

single unit. In the case of MECs, reducing equivalents from influent organics are harnessed to produce H2

157

and CH4.34,35 More broadly, microbial enzymes can be leveraged to facilitate redox reactions, enabling the

158

production of a wide-range of products (e.g., pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, polymers).36 Future efforts

159

to integrate a PRR approach with cyanophycin can incorporate electrochemical techniques to improve N

160

separations. For example, the cyclical acid and base addition that may limit large-scale cyanophycin

161

production can be circumvented with electrochemical water splitting, which generates acid via water

162

oxidation and base via water reduction.

163
164

Expanding the Nitrogen Product Portfolio

165

Recovered nitrogen has a variety of potential end uses (Table 1), many of which are significantly

166

higher value than nitrogenous fertilizers. For example, recovered nitrogen in the form of ammonia can be

167

used to produce nitrogen-containing chemical compounds such as alkyl amines, which can be further

168

transformed to produce rubber, pesticides, or as a solvent for carbon capture37. Ammonia can also be used

169

to produce nitric acid, nitroglycerin, and specialty organic compounds37. Cyanophycin contains the amino

170

acids arginine, lysine, and aspartic acid, which are found in traditional protein sources for animal feed

171

formulations such as soybean meal and fish meal.38 Replacing those protein sources with cyanophycin could

172

provide additional environmental benefits such as reduced N2O emissions from crop production, reduced

173

agricultural land requirements for crops, and improved efficiencies for nitrogen feed to food chains.

174

Alternatively, these amino acids can be extracted from the cyanophycin and directly used in multiple

175

industries such as food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.39,40 These amino acids could also be further

176

processed to produce various high-value chemical products such as acrylonitrile, acrylamide, and 1,4-

177

diaminobutane39. Having several potential end products can allow WWTPs to optimize nitrogen recovery

178

and processing to meet dynamic market demands.

Conclusion

183

Advancing wastewater N recovery will require research and development progress on multiple

fronts, including innovation in N bioconcentration strategies, efficient and tunable N separations, and N

185

product development. We propose that established C and P recovery methods in a PRR framework can

186

serve as inspiration for N recovery, and we chart opportunities for tandem recovery with aqueous N species.

187

We highlight cyanophycin as a novel target biopolymer for N bioconcentration, N-rich sidestream

188

diversion, and recovery in this PRR framework. We anticipate that integrated research in biological

189

processes and physicochemical separations will open opportunities for targets beyond cyanophycin that are

190

tunable to desired product qualities. Moreover, we postulate that expanding the product portfolio for N

191

recovery is needed to allow WWTPs to integrate technologies that enable them to produce various high-

192

value products and update their product slates based on changes in the market. This economic viability

193

could be achieved by WWTPs collaborating with local stakeholders such as farmers or chemical facilities

194

and developing mutually beneficial partnerships. These partnerships will be crucial as novel biological

195

pathways are identified and incorporated to expand the N portfolio. Combining established

196

physicochemical and emerging electrochemical techniques can further improve the selectivity and recovery

197

of N-rich bioproducts (like cyanophycin) as well as inorganic nitrogen species. Ultimately, N recovery can

198

offset fossil energy and CO2 emissions associated with the Haber-Bosch process while promoting a circular

199

water economy that reimagines wastewater pollutants as chemical commodities.
