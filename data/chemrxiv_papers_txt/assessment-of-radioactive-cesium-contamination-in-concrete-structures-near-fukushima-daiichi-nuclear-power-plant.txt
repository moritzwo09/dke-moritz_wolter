Abstract
This study investigates the contamination of concrete by radioactive cesium released by the Tokyo Electric Power Company
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident using samples from various sites in the town of Okuma, Japan. Concrete
contamination was effectively evaluated through surface dose rate measurements using Geiger-Müller tubes with shielding.
Corresponding radioactivity concentrations were evaluated using an NaI scintillator in a low background environment. The
contamination levels were considerably lower in areas shielded from rain compared with outdoor areas exposed to rain.
Contamination within concrete can be primarily attributed to radioactive Cs enrichment in specific concrete aggregates and
further influenced by carbonation of the cement paste. In non-carbonated sections, radioactive Cs was concentrated in
aggregates near the surface, hindering the penetration of detection into the cement paste. Concrete samples subjected to rain
exhibited reduced contamination over time. Thus, rain exposure, aggregate properties, and the degree of carbonation emerged
as pivotal in predicting concrete contamination. Therefore, this study yields insights into on-site measurement methods,
temporal contamination trends in the environment, and the distribution of contamination within concrete structures.

Introduction

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (1F) operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) experienced a
catastrophic accident during the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, leading to widespread contamination of
eastern Japan, primarily by radioactive cesium (Fig. 1; [1]). The contamination of various types of concrete from off-site
localities close to 1F was investigated in our previous study [2]. Further evaluation of contamination levels within concrete
structures is crucial for discerning the migration of radioactive Cs within concrete pits utilized for the disposal of radioactively
contaminated waste and further aiding the demolition of the 1F buildings.
Previous studies have reported on post-accident concrete contamination at nuclear facilities such as the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant (ChPP) [3], the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant (TMI) [4], and 1F [5]. Analysis of concrete with epoxy
coatings at building 1F has revealed that contamination is confined solely to the epoxy surface layer but does not permeate
deeper within the concrete structure [5], consistent with results for TMI. In the ChPP case study, core samples were collected
from the exterior wall section of a 6-story reinforced concrete building and analyzed to a depth of 5 mm [3]. The contamination
level decreased by 90% within 5 mm of the surface. Similarly, high contamination levels were confined to depths of a few
centimeters in paint cracks at TMI [4].
In a previous study [2], we demonstrated that contamination can penetrate concrete up to 10 cm along existing cracks, a
phenomenon hitherto unreported. The penetration of radionuclides into concrete under saturated conditions, such as those
encountered in turbine pit basements, have been actively investigated through experiments under the Japanese Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) “Wisdom Project” [6,7,8,9].
Experimental studies have revealed that Cs penetration into concrete is notably influenced by the constituents of the
concrete (particularly concrete aggregates with Cs adsorption properties) as well as the state of deterioration (notably
neutralization and Ca dissolution) and the contamination environment (in which potassium may competitively adsorb against
Cs) [9].
The ChPP incident involved a reactor core explosion, dispersing various fission products (FPs), while at the TMI,
contamination resulted from core cooling water containing boric acid from the pressurized water reactor seeping into the
concrete. By contrast, at 1F, the turbine building basement was initially flooded by the tsunami and subsequently exposed to
a mixture of core water and seawater injected for core cooling, leading to contamination by water-soluble FPs. The effects of
boric acid were limited because of the core water composition of the boiling water reactor and its mixing with seawater.
Within the upper structures of the F1 building, leaks from the core periphery released the primary volatile elements as aerosols,

depositing them within the building through piping ducts, and outdoors were contaminated with rain fall. Given this
contamination process, radioactive Cs emerges as the primary radionuclide contributing to the ongoing contamination [10] in
upper structure components. Therefore, each concrete contamination scenario is unique and depends on the accident
circumstances, concrete condition, and contamination history.
The large volume of concrete at 1F (estimated at approximately 800,000 m3 [6]) necessitates the evaluation of
contamination status and effective management, decontamination, storage, and disposal based on precise assessments of
radioactivity concentration [11]. Contamination, often penetrating deeply along cracks (up to 10 cm depending on crack
density [9]), poses formidable challenges to decontamination and potential reuse. Consequently, demolition emerges as the
final stage of decommissioning, and sufficient time must be allowed for its execution. However, certain superstructure
components of 1F are planned to be demolished earlier to facilitate the removal of molten fuel debris. The air dose rate at 1F,
notably lower in the superstructures compared with the significantly contaminated underground structure [12], demands
earlier contamination estimation for the less contaminated superstructures. Despite over 100 measurements [13], the
contamination status of 1F concrete has yet to be comprehensively evaluated.
For the above reasons, this study performed a comparative analysis of the contamination results of concrete surveyed at
various locations across Okuma town and buildings adjacent to 1F. The surveyed concrete, predominantly exposed to outdoor
environments, exhibited considerable variation in contamination levels. For example, concrete affected by the tsunami
included collapsed columns, upright columns, and rubble, which may or may not have been stripped of surface concrete, may
or may not contain cracks, and may have been altered by rain differently. Furthermore, temporal variations in contamination
were observed at the same sites. Structural concrete examination revealed the emergence of various phenomena that cannot
be predicted solely through laboratory experiments. This paper discusses the crucial factors for predicting contamination
levels realistically.

2. Field survey and analysis
(1) Survey periods
This paper summarizes the results of four distinct surveys. The first survey was conducted on December 2, 2014, at several
locations in Okuma town. The primary objective was to conduct a general survey of contamination levels at each location.
The second survey was conducted on December 2-3, 2015, focusing on the structure of the former Fukushima Prefecture
Fish Farming Experimental Station, which was located approximately 500 m south of the southern boundary of the 1F site.
The station was situated a few meters above sea level, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The measurements focused on the
contamination of rubble and the effects of cracks.
The third survey was conducted on October 27, 2017 at the same location as the 2015 survey. Core samples were extracted
from different sections of the building for analysis.
Finally, the fourth survey was conducted on January 17, 2024, at the same location as the 2015 and 2017 surveys. The aim
was to assess temporal changes in surface dose rates and contamination depths.
(2) Location of the surveys
The first survey was conducted at several sites across Okuma Town with varying air dose rates (Fig. 1). These sites included
concrete lids of road gutters, pavement concrete around buildings, building columns (described in the next section), and
concrete construction blocks. Surface dose rates were measured in the field using Geiger-Müller (GM) tubes, while
radioactivity concentrations were determined on crushed core samples at the National Institute of Environmental Studies
laboratory in Tsukuba City, which is a low radiation background laboratory.
The facility surveyed in the second through fourth stages is described in more detail here, and the sampling locations are
indicated in the next section. The facility is a dome-shaped building, which featured a circular pool for flatfish farming. The
building endured severe damage during the March 11, 2011 tsunami, half of the building on the seaward side having collapsed
(Fig. 2). Additionally, a neighboring one-story reinforced concrete building suffered partial destruction, including the collapse
of a wall (Fig. 3).

(3) Sample collection sites in the 3rd and 4th surveys
Samples were collected from rubble and debris of collapsed concrete buildings (Fig. 4) and from intact concrete structures.
The intact structures included a column that was cracked by the tsunami but was standing upright (Fig. 5a), a collapsed column
(Fig. 5b), a collapsed column with a spalled concrete cover (Fig. 5c), the floor of the facility (Fig. 5d), and the bottom of the
aqua-farming pond (Fig. 5e).

(4) Surface dose rate measurement
Surface dose rates for radioactive Cs were measured using two types of survey meter: an NaI scintillator type meter (NaI,
TCS-172B, ALOKA) and GM tube type meter (TGS-146B, ALOKA). A 8.4-kg lead cylindrical shield was employed to
minimize environmental radiation effects. Measurements were conducted with the surface of the detector protected by a plastic
film and meters were in direct contact with the sample under examination. NaI meters predominantly detect gamma-rays,
which have a greater penetration depth so that signals are assessed not only from the surface layer of the sample but also from
deeper parts (up to roughly 10 cm). GM tubes primarily detect beta-ray radiations which has a shorter depth penetration range,
providing radiation readings at the sample surface. The effectiveness of the shielding is expected to be relatively high.
(5) Core sampling
The depth of radioactive Cs penetration can be estimated to some degree from the relationship between on-site GM tube
and NaI measurements [2]. However, estimation through this method is challenging when the dose rate in the surface layer is

https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bqr88 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5835-8636 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

considerably higher than that of deeper layers or when Cs penetration is inhomogeneous. Therefore, cores with diameters of
47 mm and 50 mm were collected in the second and third surveys and the fourth survey, respectively, through core drilling
using water-lubricated core bits. Given the outdoor exposure of the samples to rainfall over several years, the impact of water
usage during drilling was considered negligible. The sampling process is shown in Figs. 5a-c.
Radioactive Cs penetration into the collected cores was assessed by cutting the cores along their length (i.e., depth). Cores
obtained during the second survey were cut using a dry wire saw [2], but subsequent surveys employed a water-cooled
diamond wheel saw for in-field cutting because of operational inefficiency and substantial dust generation by the dry-wire
saw.
(6) Radioactivity concentration measurement
Radioactivity concentration of radioactive Cs was measured using a Ge-type detector (ORTEC GMX-15190) for Cs-137
and Cs-134. The total concentration was measured without decay calibration. The concrete samples were crushed to particles
of sizes less than 1.25 mm under homogeneous conditions and several 10s grams of samples were placed in 100 cm3 plastic
vessels (U-8 vessels).
In cases where contamination was predicted only for the aggregate portion, a small sample was ground from the aggregate
using a milling machine equipped with a 10-mm diameter drill bit. Considering that the precision of the quantification is
uncertain because of the small sample quantity, a simple quantification was performed based on the peak intensity of each
radionuclide.
(7) Radioactive contamination depth measurement
The cut surfaces of the core, from which the Cs-137 depth profile was obtained, were evaluated through autoradiography
with imaging plates (IPs). Measurements were conducted on the surface of the original structure and on two or three depthsegmented surfaces of the core.
The radioactivity distribution was evaluated by simultaneously exposing a cement paste (cylindrical shape with a diameter
of 20 mm and a height of 10 mm) containing 1 MBq/kg of Cs-137. All samples were placed on an IP (GE Healthcare MS2025)
for measurements over different time durations, with the sample surfaces protected by thin plastic film. After exposure, the
IP was loaded into a signal reading holder in a dark room. A GE Healthcare Typhoon FLA7700 was used for signal reading.
The collected data were converted into a two-dimensional quantitative map using Image Quant V.8.2 (GE Healthcare).

3. Results
(1) Surface dose rate
The surface dose rate measurements of structural concrete and rubble obtained during the first survey are depicted in Figs.
6 and 7, respectively. Ideally, a 1:1 linear relationship is expected for each measurement method, irrespective of shielding
presence, in the absence of external environmental influences. However, as shown in Fig. 6, a comparison of the two methods,
particularly with NaI, revealed poor correlation because of significant variation, with unshielded measurements yielding
higher values in some cases. In addition, the effectiveness of shielding exhibited substantial variability across measurement
locations because of difference air dose rates. As shown in Fig. 7, the measurements using the unshielded GM tube yielded
larger values but with relatively good linearity for shielded measurements.
Fig. 6 illustrates an overall linear relationship between respective dose rates when data are grouped based on shielding
presence, although γ-rays cannot be entirely shielded, leading to variation. However, certain measurement locations,
delineated by red circles, indicated considerably elevated values in the absence of shielding, attributable to increased air dose
rates. One contributing factor could be the presence of soil. As experienced in decontamination works in off-site, at the place
where rainwater directly drained from gutters to the ground exhibited locally quite higher dose rates even during off-site
decontamination efforts [13]. This phenomenon arises from the adsorption of radioactive Cs by soil, with rainwater containing
radioactive Cs increasing its concentration upon continuous supply. Although the surveyed facility predominantly comprises
concrete-covered areas, grass growth from the soil was observed in some regions; the points encircled in red indicate areas
influenced by soil radiation. Excluding these data points, the correlation coefficient R2 between values with and without
shielding increased from 0.42 to 0.75. Additionally, shielding resulted in a reduction of counts by 5 µSv/h (y-intercept of the
regression line), equivalent to 36% of the maximum value of 18 µSv/h.
Fig. 7 shows the relationship between GM tube readings with and without shielding. The correlation coefficient R2 of 0.97
indicates strong linearity, with shielding reducing readings by an average of 2 kcpm. This reduction, accounting for 10% of
the maximum value of 23 kcpm, represents a fraction of the effect observed with NaI. Essentially, β-ray measurements exhibit
relatively low sensitivity to variations in air dose rates at measurement sites. Among fission products, Cs-134 and Cs-137

emitting β and γ rays and Sr-90 emitting β rays, primarily influence dose rates. Typically, GM tubes detect β-rays from these
nuclides. However, in scenarios where contamination is primarily attributed to radioactive Cs, as observed at the 1F off-site
locality [10], GM tube assessments offer a more appropriate gauge of contamination levels due to their lower sensitivity to
air dose rate when shielding is applied.

The rubble samples (from the aqua-farming facility) obtained during the third survey were transported to the laboratory at
the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba City for surface dose rate measurements. In the sample storage
room, the air dose rate was 0.07 µSv/h for NaI and 72 cpm for GM tube. The correlation between NaI and GM tube
measurements was plotted for field conditions (with shielding) and laboratory conditions (without shielding), respectively.
The correlation coefficient R2 was 0.60 for the field measurements and 0.89 for the laboratory measurements. The better
correlation observed for the laboratory data suggests that field measurements were influenced by radiation from the
surrounding area. The linearity between the NaI and GM tube readings indicated that, for the evaluated samples, most
radioactive Cs was concentrated near the sample surface, where β-rays remain unattenuated and penetration into the interior
of the sample is limited.

Because of the polyhedral structure of the rubble, rainfall-induced contamination may vary across the top, side, and back
surfaces. Therefore, several blocks of rubble (10 cm to 30 cm in length) were tested at each side while employing on-site
shielding. The results are summarized as a histogram in Fig. 9. The mode and maximum values were 9 kcpm and 24 kcpm
for the top surface, 3 kcpm and 9 kcpm for the sides, and 3 kcpm and 6 kcpm for the back surface, respectively. Contamination
levels were notably higher on the top surface compared with the sides, with the back surface exhibiting even lower
contamination levels. However, the determination of differences in contamination between the sides and the back is
challenging because of the limited number of measurements on the back side.

Frequency

Only one measurement of the contamination level inside the half-collapsed building was made because of the risk of
collapse of components within the structure. The readings were 0.7 µSv/h for NaI and 0.5 kcpm for GM tube, the lowest
among all measurement points.

(2) Radiation concentration
Although the radiation dose rate is crucial for managing on-site exposure, radioactivity concentration is more important
when considering disposal. Therefore, the cores collected in the initial survey were crushed and evaluated for Cs-134 and Cs137 using a Ge detector. The values apply to June 3, 2015. Given that the majority of radioactive Cs is expected to be located
in the surface layer, the radioactivity was divided by the area of the core with a diameter of 47 mm to give surface radioactivity
concentration. The ratio of Cs-134 to Cs-137 was established at 0.274, with a stable variation of 3%, indicating satisfactory
measurement accuracy.
Fig. 10 shows the relationship between surface radioactivity concentration and measured values using GM tube with a
shield in the field or NaI, which were deemed suitable for measuring total γ-ray radioactivity in a low background environment.
A robust linear relationship between surface radioactivity concentration and laboratory NaI counts was observed, with a
correlation coefficient R2 of 0.97. While a positive correlation was observed between measured values and radioactivity level
with GM tubes, the variation was substantial, as indicated by a y-intercept of 6 kcpm and R2 of 0.77. Fig. 8 shows a high
correlation between NaI and GM tube measurements in a low background environment, indicating that GM tube
measurements in the field may be moderately influenced by the air dose rate at the measurement site.
Using the regression equation, GM tube counts were converted into estimates of surface radioactivity concentration (Fig.
10), revealing an average difference of 76 Bq/cm2 from the measured values. This value is considered as an estimation error
in this study. The error in determining radioactivity density from NaI in the laboratory was 24 Bq/cm2. The dotted line in Fig.
10 represents twice the error, indicating the range of estimation from survey meter readings. Because of the relatively large
error associated with estimating radioactivity density from field measurements using GM tubes, for more accurate estimation,
the radioactivity concentration of core samples is recommended to be assessed in the laboratory using NaI. Note that
radioactive Sr was not evaluated in this analysis.

(3) Changes in surface dose rate over time in the field
Field measurements of aqua-farming facility columns were conducted twice, once in the second and again in the fourth
surveys. Fig. 11 shows two examples of columns measured at the same location. The values were adjusted to reflect the
conditions on March 11, 2011, accounting for attenuation effects. In Fig. 6, only a low correlation between NaI and GM tube
data was observed. However, in Fig. 11, a high correlation between NaI and GM tube data was observed for both collapsed
and upright columns, indicating consistent air dose rates at the same location.
Examining results for the collapsed column in Fig. 11a, both GM tube and NaI readings were reduced by half in January
2024, approximately 8 years later, compared with measurements conducted in December 2015. This reduction could signify
the leaching of radioactive Cs into the environment due to rain. Measurements above cracked surfaces were greater than those

in the crack-free areas in December 2015, but no clear difference was observed in the January 2024 measurements. The reason
for this is not well understood.

Fig. 11b depicts results for an upright column on the north face, facing to the 1F site. Compared with the collapsed column,
the measured values were approximately half. This aligns with the trend observed for rubble in Fig. 9, where the top surface
exposed to rainwater remained highly contaminated. Over time, the contamination levels decreased substantially, which is
particularly evident in cracked parts where the dose rate was halved. On the other hand, while the dose rate decreased in areas
without cracks, the reduction was not as substantial as in the cracked parts. The surface dose rate also decreased with age in
both collapsed and upright columns.

(4) Changes in radioactive Cs distribution over time during storage
Samples collected in December 2015 during the second survey were stored in plastic bags until November 2016, when the
cores were dry cut, and IP measurements of the cross sections were conducted [2]. Subsequently, the samples were placed in
plastic bags again and stored in SUS containers of 20 L volume with other concrete samples in a storage facility. The
temperature and humidity of the storage facility was not controlled. The humidity in the container was 50 %RH in May 2024.
In February 2024, the samples were removed and re-measured.
Fig. 12 shows cross-sectional autoradiographs of cores from a collapsed column with a crack (left) and an upright column
with a crack (right). The top images were captured in November 2016 [2], while the bottom images were captured in February
2024. While the intensity decreased because of radioactive decay of Cs-134 and Cs-137, their distribution remained consistent,
with no discernible traces of migration.
Under dry conditions, radioactive Cs exhibited minimal migration detectable by IP-based evaluation. Although previous
measurements have revealed Cs reduction from the surface upon exposure to outdoor rainwater, Cs concentration was constant
in dry environments.
In a simple cement paste specimen, we reported that Cs-137 moved during drying [15]. Cs-137 was concentrated around
the disks over time, when 1 MBq/kg of Cs-137 was added to ordinary Portland cement paste having 0.50 of water-to-cement
ratio, using a solution with a radioactivity concentration of 200 kBq/mL and a CsCl concentration of 0.05 mass%, and
processed into disks with a diameter of 2 cm and a thickness of 1.6 mm, covered on both sides with Mylar membrane and Al
tape [15]. This concentration phenomenon might be attributed to slight water migration during the weeks to months after
molding. Cement paste typically consists of calcium silicate hydrate with a high Ca/Si ratio and contains large amounts of Na
and K, which interact minimally with Cs. Therefore, Cs, being an alkali metal, is assumed to migrate along with the water. As
water migration decreases over longer time scales, the migration of Cs may also cease.
Radioactive Cs did not exhibit mobility within concrete as shown in Fig. 12 because, besides the above reason, Cs is
absorbed and immobilized in certain types of aggregates within the concrete [16], preventing migration under sealed indoor
conditions. When Sr-90 was introduced into cement paste, the concentration distribution of Sr-90 remained uniform over time,
with no observable concentration gradients [15]. Similarly, no migration concentrations were observed over time when Cs137 was sprayed on river gravel crushed material and molded with epoxy resin. Cs-137 migrated only within the neat Portland
cement paste.

(5) Contamination of cores from different positions
Images of the exterior of six concrete cores collected from different building locations during the third survey are shown in
Fig. 13. These sites include an upright column, a collapsed column which had lost concrete cover, a cracked floor surface
coated with anti-slip sand-containing resin within the facility, and the cracked bottom surface of the aqua-farming pond with
some coating. The width of the sample from floor was 1 mm and that of the sample from pond bottom was 0.2 mm.
Fig. 14 shows the IP images of the core surfaces, representing the concrete surfaces within the structure. The collapsed
columns whose concrete cover had been lost were excluded from measurement due to surface irregularities. Within the surface
layer of the upright columns, scattered areas exhibit spotty high radiation dose rates. Although correlating these areas with the
optical image of the surface in Fig. 13 is challenging, it is hypothesized that the concentration in the aggregate areas is high,
with some degree of adsorption in other cement paste areas [9].
On the other hand, contamination levels were low for the facility floor and remained at background levels even when the
contrast was increased by a factor of 5. Similarly, the bottom of the aqua-farming pond exhibited low and uniform
contamination. Despite the floor surface being contaminated with glassy transparent sand, no notable concentrated radiation
dose rate was discerned, suggesting a lack of interaction with Cs. However, details of the painted layer on the bottom of the
aqua-farming pond were not revealed.

Fig. 15 IP images of cores from upright columns (upper) and from collapsed columns without concrete cover (lower). The
core diameter is 47 mm. The exposure time was 48 h. Signals were detected only from the surface, and photographs of cores
are overlapped on the near-surface position of IP images for better visual comparison.

IP images of core cross sections cut into three pieces are shown in Figs. 15-17. In Fig. 15, the upper section indicates two
cores extracted from an upright column. These cores had flat surfaces, enabling the placement of a shield to mitigate the
influence of scattered rays from the specimen surface. Radioactive Cs penetrated to a depth of a few millimeters. Weak signals
were detected within the some types of aggregate particles and are particularly evident in diagrams in the upper left and second
from the right of Fig. 15.
The lower portion of Fig. 15 indicates two cores obtained from a collapsed column lacking concrete cover. Radioactive
contamination was confined to a superficial layer locally, and penetration into the interior was not detected during this
measurement. Because of the irregular surface, it was difficult to shield the scatting signals from the surface. The localization
of signal suggests that the contamination is limited to the specific light-colored aggregate as shown in Fig. 15 lower right but
no or very limited contamination was observed for dark colored aggregate and cement paste part.
Fig. 16 shows an IP image of a core originating from areas with a surface coating. The top image displays a core sourced
from a cracked section of a floor within the facility with a resin coating. Contamination penetrated deeply into the concrete
along the cracks, with high intensity approximately 1 cm below the surface, gradually diminishing with depth. Cracks diverged
at a depth of approximately 5 cm, with evident penetration along the divergent cracks. Signals were detected in the specific
light-colored aggregate within the deeper part of the sample, suggesting potential penetration of radioactive Cs through the
cracks into the aggregate. While localized concentrated spots were noted throughout the sample, clarity regarding whether
these were contaminated during sample processing or representative of the original distribution of radioactive Cs
contamination in some sand particles remains uncertain.
The lower section of Fig. 16 displays a core from a cracked area at the bottom of the aqua-farming pond. In this region, the
concrete featured a 10 cm thick mortar overlying the concrete foundation, with no discernible resin layer on the surface. The
material utilized for coating is not known. Here, a signal was detected from the surface layer and only a weak signal was
detected along the cracks. Although the cracks traversed the entire surface mortar and reached a depth of approximately 8 cm,
the Cs penetration depth was limited to a few millimeters. The reason for minimal penetration along the cracks in this area is
unclear. Signals were also discerned from the aggregate deep within this core. The texture of these aggregate particles suggests
a potential granite containing potassium feldspar, with radiation potentially stemming from natural K-40. Therefore, a sample
of 0.12 g was ground to a 1-mm thickness using a milling machine and subsequently measured using a Ge detector for 16.5
h. While no K-40 was detected, Cs-137 was detected at 65 Bq/kg, but this is lower than the detection limit of 360 Bq/kg,
hindering accurate evaluation. Additionally, a weak signal was dispersed throughout the sample, suggesting the possibility of
radioactive Cs concentration in specific aggregates or sands, but further investigation is needed.

(6) Effects of carbonation and aggregates
A cross-sectional IP image of a core collected from a collapsed column (with concrete cover) during the fourth survey is
shown in Fig. 17. This figure shows a photograph displaying the cut surface of the core, a photograph depicting the core after
being sprayed with a phenolphthalein ethanol solution, a composite image merging the IP image with the cross-sectional
photograph, and an original IP image. Concrete is neutralized by carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere, leading to the
carbonation of calcium hydroxide, a byproduct of cement hydration, to form calcium carbonate.
Fig. 18 shows the distribution of radioactivity concentration, specifically calibrated as Cs-137, derived from the IP image
analysis. In all samples, radioactive Cs was notably present in neutralized regions, identifiable by their absence of red coloring.
Carbonated cement paste can adsorb a significantly greater amount of Cs [17], potentially influencing the detection
capabilities of IP images regarding Cs penetration into the paste area, given the tenfold increase in radioactive Cs
concentration in the surface layer resulting scattering of signals. To determine whether radioactive Cs has permeated beyond
the carbonated portion, the carbonated section should be removed, or grinding should be conducted, with subsequent analysis
of the grinding dust for radioactivity.
The contamination level of the surface layer is presumed to have diminished over time and is estimated to have been in 100
kBq/kg order in January 2024. As shown in the lower part of Fig. 15, radioactive Cs was concentrated in the surface aggregate
location, with no evident penetration detected in the concrete's interior. However, contamination by radioactive Cs occurred
after the spalling of covered concrete when the concrete was not neutralized. Thus, even if Cs penetration occurred, the signal
might have been too weak for detection compared to the strong signals from some aggregate positions.
Fig. 17 (middle) and Fig. 17 (lower) depict also the signals detected within the aggregates. Samples weighing 0.23 g and
0.10 g were obtained from each aggregate position using a milling machine, and both samples were evaluated using a Getype detector for 2.5 h and 3.5 h, respectively. The radiation concentrations of the aggregates depicted in Fig. 17 (middle and
lower sections) were measured at 19 kBq/kg and 45 kBq/h, respectively. These values closely align with those obtained from
the quantitative analysis through IP, as depicted in Fig. 18, indicating a greater penetration of radioactive Cs into these
aggregates compared with the surrounding cement paste sections. This difference can be attributed to the Cs adsorbing
capacity differences in cement paste with limited capacity and some types of aggregate with much more capacity.

Key points to consider in predicting Cs penetration into concrete

This paper presents findings of an assessment of concrete contamination in the context of future demolition plans for the
1F concrete buildings [11], which requires estimation of contamination distribution and depth. The immediate demolition
target is the superstructure of the building, which is considered to be contaminated by aerosols similar to the off-site concrete,
rather than the turbine basement pit, which is directly exposed to contaminated water with various radionuclides. Therefore,
the findings in this study for off-site concrete can be a reference for the contamination estimation of superstructures in 1F
buildings.
Radioactive Cs is considered to be the primary contaminant of superstructure of buildings, and the radioactive
contamination of on-site concrete structures is affected by several factors. First, contamination primarily occurs through the
carbonated portion of cement paste, as illustrated in Figs. 15 and 17, and contamination of the non-carbonated paste is less
pronounced. Although the contamination of non-carbonated paste remains unclear, carbonation level in concrete is the primary
contributor to radioactive Cs contamination.
Second, IP measurements reveal penetration of radioactive Cs and its adsorption into aggregates, with Fig. 17 indicating
concentration within aggregates rather than in the surrounding cement paste. Additionally, the lower portion of Fig. 17
suggests that Cs concentration occurs in some types of aggregate through cracks at shallow depths. Considering the differing
Cs adsorption behavior of several types of rock as reported in previous studies [18], actual rock types used and their weathering
products need to be examined.

Third, rainfall may facilitate Cs leaching from carbonated cement paste, while leaching from aggregates may be limited, as
depicted in Fig. 11. Therefore, Cs adsorption on carbonated cement paste and Cs-adsorbing aggregate must be examined.
Lastly, indoor surface dose rate measurements indicated minimal contamination. Outer resin painting likely limits Cs
penetration, and indoor areas are largely shielded from rainfall. Therefore, ion penetration under non-saturated conditions
must be examined separately from that in rain-exposed areas, although Cs contamination is primarily caused by aerosols.
Many studies have focused on Cs penetration into cement and concrete over long time durations [19, 20, 21, 22]. This study
highlights three critical factors for predicting concrete contamination by radioactive Cs not have reported: the depth of
concrete carbonation, aggregate Cs adsorption, and whether the cement is exposed to water or remains dry.

Conclusions

The study performed surface dose rate measurements on concrete at several sites around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant, radioactivity concentration assessments in a low radioactive background environment of sampled cores, and
autoradiographic evaluation of core cross-sections using IP technology. The key findings of this study are as follows:
・ If field, surface dose rate measurements using Geiger-Müller (GM) tubes were found to be more suitable for
assessing concrete contamination than an NaI scintillator, because the latter is more susceptible to environmental
radioactivity even with shielding.
・ Estimating radioactivity concentration from GM tube measurements in the field yielded relatively large variations.
Conversely, measurements using NaI in a low background environment could estimate surface radioactivity concentration
assumed as Cs-137 with an accuracy of ±47 Bq/cm2 in the range up to 600 Bq/cm2.
・ Contamination of rubble was observed to be higher on the top surface and lower on the sides and back surfaces of
the rubble. Similarly, contamination of building columns was greater when they had collapsed and were flat-lying
compared with when they were upright.
・ Surface dose rates on collapsed columns outdoors halved from December 2014 to January 2024, indicating potential
dissolution of radioactive Cs adsorbed on carbonated cement paste parts.
・ Radioactive Cs in samples sealed and stored indoors suggesting a dry condition exhibited no migration.
・ Surface contamination in concrete was observed in carbonated cement paste parts, with Cs concentration primarily
by the aggregate adsorption.
・ Contamination of concrete was evident in carbonated parts but only at the surface of non-carbonated parts where
the concrete had collapsed and its concrete cover was spalled.
・ Certain aggregate types exhibited radioactive Cs penetration throughout particles, indicating contamination levels
surpassing those in surrounding cement paste.
Based on these findings, the following factors are deemed crucial for estimating contamination of the 1F concrete
superstructure.
・ Depth of concrete carbonation,
・ Aggregate characteristics influencing Cs adsorption, and
・ Environmental conditions, namely whether concrete was dry or in contact with water.
