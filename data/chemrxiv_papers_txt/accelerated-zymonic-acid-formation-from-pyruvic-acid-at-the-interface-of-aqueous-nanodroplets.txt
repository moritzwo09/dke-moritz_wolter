Abstract
To explore the role of the liquid interface in mediating reactivity in small compartments, the
formation kinetics of zymonic acid (ZA) is measured in submicron aerosols (average radius = 240
nm) using mass spectrometry. Formation of ZA, from a condensation reaction of two pyruvic acid
(PA) molecules, proceeds over days in bulk solutions, while in submicron aerosols occurs in
minutes. The experimental results are replicated in a kinetic model using an apparent interfacial
reaction rate coefficient of krxn = 0.9 ± 0.2 × 10-3 M-1 · s-1. The simulation reveals that surface activity
of PA coupled with enhanced interfacial reaction rate drive accelerated ZA formation in aerosols.
Experimental and simulated results provide compelling evidence that the condensation reaction of
PA occurs exclusively at the aerosol interface with a reaction rate coefficient that is enhanced by
4 orders of magnitudes (~104) relative to what is estimated for macroscale solutions.

Liquid interfaces play a fundamental role in chemical, biological, and environmental
processes.1–4 Chemical reactions at liquid-liquid and liquid-air interfaces have gained considerable
interest over the last decade because of reports of reactions that are accelerated by orders of
magnitude compared to those in bulk solutions.5–8 Recent studies of enhanced reaction rates in
microcompartments (e.g., microdroplets and emulsions) suggest that partial or preferential
solvation of reactants at the liquid interface and the large surface to volume ratio are key
contributors to reaction acceleration.9–15 In the case of condensation reactions, the kinetic and
thermodynamic limitations in bulk solutions due to water elimination have been shown to be
reduced at the liquid interfaces.16,17 Nonetheless, the mechanism for reaction acceleration at liquid
interfaces and an accurate kinetic description of the interfacial chemistry remain unclear due to the
difficulties of quantifying chemical evolution of (sub)micron-sized systems.
Pyruvic acid (PA), a small alpha-keto acid, is widely studied, abundant in the atmosphere,
and contributes to secondary organic aerosol formation by photochemistry.18–20 The overlap of

solar radiation and the n-π* transition of PA (300 - 380 nm) has led to extensive studies of PA
photochemistry.21–26 Interestingly, photochemical reactions of PA at the air-water interface are
shown to enhance oligomerization over that observed in the bulk solutions.26 Furthermore, the
formation of zymonic acid (ZA, molecular weight = 158 g/mol) from condensation of two PA
molecules is observed even in the absence of photochemistry.26,27 This result is surprising as the
bulk reaction requires a highly acidic environment (pH ~ 0) to form ZA with a reaction timescale
of several weeks to months.28,29 Recently, however, Li et al. showed that this dark condensation
reaction occurs in sessile microdroplets, where ZA formation is relatively rapid (few hours).30,31
The formation kinetics of ZA, which occur simultaneously with the evaporation of PA and water,
are observed to be sigmoidal and size dependent.30,31
However, questions remain about the kinetics and mechanism of PA chemistry occurring
exclusively at the interface of microdroplets. For example, does the apparent enhanced reaction
arise from the interfacial enrichment of reagents and/or a much larger rate coefficient for the
surface reaction? Does ZA produced at the surface stay at the surface or partition to the bulk? To
answer these questions, the rate coefficient for ZA formation must be quantified within a realistic
kinetic description of the bulk-surface partitioning of PA and ZA.26,27,30 Furthermore, since PA is
relatively volatile (vapor pressure at 298K = 175 Pa),32,33 the mechanism must fully account for
the natural competition between evaporation and the reaction of PA.
In this study, interfacial reaction kinetics of PA are investigated by measuring the temporal
evolution of [PA] and [ZA] in aqueous aerosols and analyzing the experimental data using a kinetic
model that explicitly accounts for surface and bulk reactions.11,34–39 Submicron aerosols of aqueous
PA with NaCl (ravg = 240 nm, Figure S1) are generated using an atomizer, then directed through a
variable number of quartz flow tubes in order to change the reaction time from 3 to 70 seconds as

shown in Figure 1a. NaCl is added to the aerosols to keep the droplet volume constant over the
reaction time (i.e., to control water activity). The concentrations of PA and ZA in aerosols are
quantified with respect to an internal standard (succinic acid d-4) with low volatility40 as a function
of time by using aerosol atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS).
Time-resolved aerosol mass spectra are shown in Figure 1b. Experimental design and MS analysis
is discussed in detail in Supplementary Information (SI Figure S1-3). These aerosol measurements
are compared with bulk reactions to ensure that the observed kinetics of PA and ZA occur
exclusively in aerosols. A kinetic model is then developed that includes realistic descriptions of
bulk-to-interface partitioning, evaporation, and interfacial reaction.18,32,33,41,42
The kinetics of [PA] and [ZA] in aerosols ([PA]0 = 370 mM) are shown in Figure 2. The
simultaneous decrease of [PA] and formation of [ZA] is observed. After 70 seconds, the [PA]
decreased by ~80% (Figure 2a), and ~8 mM of ZA is detected (Figure 2b). This kinetic behavior
is consistent for [PA]0 = 230 and 90 mM aerosols (Figure S4). To investigate the difference of

reaction kinetics in aerosols versus bulk solutions, MS measurements are made from bulk solutions
with the same composition as aerosols (i.e., [PA]0 = 370 mM and [NaCl] = 4.6 M) (Figure S5).
After 2.5 hours the MS of the bulk solution does not show significant changes in [PA] and [ZA],
and the linear fits to the bulk data are shown for comparison as dashed lines in Figure 2a and b.
The result from this control experiment agrees with previous literature where the timescale of ZA
formation in bulk solutions ranges from weeks to months.28,29 These observations clearly
demonstrate that the formation of ZA is favored in small droplets, likely because the air-water
interface is a substantial fraction of the reaction environment.27,30
Additionally, since the formation of ZA from two PA molecules requires the elimination
of water, the role of rapid water evaporation during the initial equilibration process (i.e. as the
droplets exit the atomizer) to 80% RH is evaluated. As a control experiment, aerosols are generated
from the solutions with the PA and NaCl concentrations identical to the equilibrated conditions at
RH = 80% ([PA] = 370 mM and [NaCl] = 4.6 M), thus aerosols experience no rapid evaporation.
The aerosols are then routed through the same set of flow tubes with ~70 seconds reaction time as

done for the data shown in Figure 2. The results still show the formation of ZA with increasing
reaction time indicating that rapid initial water evaporation is not required to form ZA (Figure S6).
It is also confirmed that the hydrolysis of ZA back into 2 pyruvic acid molecules is negligible under
our conditions by running aerosols with ZA only ([ZA]0 = 41 mM) in the flow tubes (Figure S7).
We find no noticeable changes in [ZA] or the formation of PA with reaction time for aerosols or
in bulk solutions over two hours. This result suggests that the reverse reaction rate of the ZA
formation is negligible compared to the forward reaction.
In addition to PA (m/z = 87) and ZA (m/z = 157), the kinetics of the smaller peaks (m/z =
105, 113, 175, and 193) in MS spectra (Figure 1b) are shown in Figure S8. The ZA fragment peak
at m/z = 113 (ZA-CO2-H–; identified by CID data, see Figure S2) increases as a function of time
similar to the main ZA peak (m/z = 157). The m/z = 105 peak, corresponding to the hydrated diol
of pyruvic acid, 2,2-dihydroxypropanoic acid (2,2-DHPA),26,43 exhibits decay kinetics similar to
PA. Interestingly, the m/z = 175 peak, assigned to parapyruvic acid,26,42,44 also shows a steady
decrease with reaction time, which warrants further discussion.
Parapyruvic acid (PPA) has been proposed as a reaction intermediate during the formation
of ZA as shown in (R1) where both steps are acid-catalyzed.27

(R1)
However, in the timescale of our experiments, no significant buildup of PPA as an intermediate
in aerosols is observed (Figure S8). This suggests that any PPA formed is rapidly lost to reaction,
meaning the unimolecular ring formation step (k2) would be relatively fast, and the first
bimolecular reaction (k1) is likely the rate determining step. Thus, we can simplify the proposed

mechanism (R1) to (R2), where ZA is directly formed from the bimolecular condensation of PA
with a second-order rate constant, krxn.

(R2)
As observed in Figure 2, disappearance of PA and formation of ZA occurs simultaneously
in the aerosol environment. This likely occurs at the air-water interface, which is consistent with
the observations from other studies.24,30 Interestingly, the measured kinetic data suggest that the
major contribution to the decrease of [PA] over time is evaporation. In the case of [PA]0 = 370
mM aerosols, for example, the [PA] is reduced to 80 mM after 70 seconds (Figure 2a), whereas
the [ZA] that is formed is only ~8 mM (Figure 2b). Therefore, out of 290 mM [PA], only 16 mM
of [PA] is consumed in the formation of ZA, whereas the remaining 274 mM of [PA] is lost to
evaporation. To unravel the competition between reaction and evaporation at the aerosol interface
and further quantify the rate constants for each process, a kinetic model is developed.
A two-compartment model representing the interface and bulk of an aerosol droplet and a
mechanistic description of the partitioning, evaporation, and reaction kinetics of PA and ZA is
shown in Figure 3.11,34–39 Since the aerosols remain in the liquid phase throughout the experimental
condition at 80% RH,45 it is reasonable to assume they have a spherical geometry with surface to
volume ratio (S:V) of 3/r, where r is the volume-averaged radius of the polydisperse aerosols (240
nm, Figure S1). A box model with interface and bulk compartments (Figure 3a) is used to set the
stage for stochastic simulation of the reaction and partitioning of the species in the aerosols. The
interface compartment is defined as 1 nm thick with a 1 nm2 base area. The 1 nm interfacial
thickness is consistent with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of water
interfaces.38,46,47 The bulk compartment has 1 nm2 base area with 3/r height to reflect the S:V ratio

the simulations are listed in Table S1.
Figure 3b shows the elementary kinetic steps that describe 1) interface-bulk partitioning of
PA and ZA, 2) evaporation and adsorption of PA between interface and gas phase, and 3) formation
of ZA at the interface by condensation of two PA molecules. Although PA and ZA can exist in
different forms in aqueous solution,28,50 for simplicity only the keto form of PA and closed enol
form of ZA are considered in interfacial reactions as done in other studies.30,42 The interface-bulk
partitioning, or surface activity, of PA is described by solvation (ksolv, interface to bulk) and
desolvation (kdesolv, bulk to interface) rate constants. To quantify the concentration of PA at the

From prior literature, HPA for PA is 3.06 mol · kg-1 · Pa-1.32,33,41 Note the units of the left hand side of

where Asim and Vsim are surface area and volume of the simulation geometry, respectively, as shown

phase to interface adsorption (kads) can be computed in a similar manner, using the Henry’s law
constant. In a fully enclosed system at equilibrium, kads = kevap. Although the flow tube reactors are
fully enclosed, [PA] is observed to decrease over time (Figure 2a). This decrease in [PA] cannot
be fully explained by reactive loss, as discussed above, suggesting that PA is also lost to the reactor
walls. Wall loss of gas phase molecules or aerosols are commonly observed and quantified in

experimental studies utilizing flow tubes or reaction chambers.55,56 In the kinetic model, a rate
constant for wall loss (kloss) is included as an adjustable parameter. A value of kloss = 0.1 s-1 best
replicates the measured kinetics of [PA] at three different initial PA concentrations as shown in
Figure 2a and Figure S4.
Lastly, the rate constant of ZA formation is described in the model as krxn. As discussed
previously, this reaction is assumed to follow bimolecular reaction kinetics so the units of krxn are
M-1 · s-1. Additionally, we assume the condensation reaction occurs exclusively at the interface, as
shown in Figure 3b, as a negligible quantity of ZA is formed in bulk PA solutions (Figure 2a and
Figure S4). Therefore, krxn remains as the only unknown parameter for simulating ZA formation
kinetics since the bulk-interface partitioning and evaporation of PA and ZA are constrained by

experimental data set as shown in Figure 2b and Figure S4.
In addition to reproducing MS data, the simulated results can be used to evaluate the
contributions from bulk and interface regions to the overall observed kinetics. For example, Figure
4 shows the interplay between the interface and bulk by separating the kinetics of [PA] and [ZA]
in each compartment for the [PA]0 = 370 mM data set (see Figure S10 for [PA]0 = 90 and 230 mM
aerosols). At the start of the simulation (t ~ 0 s), rapid partitioning of PA from the bulk to the
interface is observed (Figure 4a). This partitioning leads to the depletion of [PA]bulk, which is more
significant as [PA]0 decreases (Figure S11). It can be also seen in Figure 4a that the consumption
rate of [PA] is more significant in the bulk compartment compared to the interface, which can be
𝑃𝐴
explained by evaporation. Due to the surface activity of PA (𝐾𝑒𝑞
= 28.5 M-1), each time a PA

molecule evaporates from the interface to the gas phase, the adsorption site is quickly replaced by
another PA from the bulk.

concentrations. Error bars are standard deviations of three measurements. Solid black lines are
simulated total concentrations of PA and ZA in aerosols as shown in Figure 2a. Teal and orange
lines are contributions from the bulk and the interface compartments, respectively.

Unlike the overall decrease of PA in each compartment, the formation kinetics of ZA
exhibit a unique behavior. Figure 4b shows that ZA molecules predominantly partition to the bulk
compartment during the early stages of the reaction (up to ~40 seconds) although the formation of
ZA is restricted to the interface. Even though the surface propensities of ZA and PA are assumed to
be identical, the abundance of PA and the limited number of available sites at the interface lead to
the majority of ZA molecules formed at the interface to partition into bulk. However, after ~60
seconds, the ZA contribution from the bulk decreases while the coverage of ZA at the interface
steadily increases. This trend is due to the decrease of PA molecules at the interface, which are
consumed by ZA formation, evaporation, and wall loss leaving more sites at the interface for ZA,
thus increasing its bulk to interface partitioning.
Although the apparent rate constant of dark ZA formation in aerosols is obtained in this
study, the rate constant for ZA formation in bulk solutions has not been reported to our knowledge.
Only the timescale of acid-catalyzed ZA formation is reported by Düwel et al., which is 20-30
days in highly acidic solutions (1 M HCl, pH ~ 0).29 From these observations, one can roughly

estimate the value of the rate constant in bulk solutions to be krxn,bulk ~ 4.0 × 10-8 M -1 · s-1 (see Figure
S12). This estimate assumes a 40% yield of ZA after 30 days as reported.29 Using this value in
the simulations of [PA]0 = 370 mM aerosols would result in 1.1 μM (micromolar) of ZA formation
after 100 seconds of reaction time as shown in Figure S11, which cannot explain the observed ~10
mM of [ZA] in Figure 2b. We suggest this substantial degree of reaction acceleration of ZA
formation in aerosols (factor of ~104 to 105) is due both to an enhanced reaction rate at the interface
and the enrichment of PA at the interface.42 It is worth noting the value of krxn derived in this study
is ~2 orders of magnitude smaller than the value obtained from the kinetic modeling of sessile
microdroplets, although the direct comparison is difficult because of different experimental conditions
such as solid substrate, size, droplet pH, and reaction steps.31
There are a number of condensation reactions, such as peptide bond formation and imine
formation, which are also shown to be enhanced at the interface, possibly due to partial solvation
and transition state stabilization.5,12,16,17 For example, the enhanced rate of imine synthesis at the
interface of microdroplets investigated by Fallah-Araghi et al. and our group is on the order of 104

to 10-3 M-1 · s-1,5,11 similar to the apparent value obtained for ZA formation in this study (krxn = 0.9

± 0.2 × 10-3 M-1 · s-1). In addition, the ZA production via photochemical reactions of PA is also
significantly enhanced at the interface compared to bulk, according to the study by Kappes et al.26
These findings, along with our analysis, strongly suggest that the formation of ZA in aerosols is
another example of a water-eliminating reaction preferentially occurring at the liquid interface.
Moreover, the enhanced concentration of surface-active reactants at the interface is
considered one of the key factors of accelerated reaction kinetics in small systems.11,15,57 To

is decreased. This tendency clearly shows that the surface activity of PA in aqueous

systems is one of the underlying causes for accelerated formation of ZA. The effect of surface
activity of PA on reaction acceleration is especially pronounced in this study because PA
concentrations in the bulk compartment stay relatively low compared to the interface ([PA]bulk <
400 mM vs [PA]interface = 4.3 M), and the reactions occur exclusively at the interface.
In conclusion, the accelerated formation of ZA via PA condensation reaction in aerosols is
measured by time-resolved MS analysis. To explain the observed decrease of [PA] and increase
of [ZA] in aerosols, a kinetic model including droplet geometry, bulk to interface partitioning,
interfacial reaction, and evaporation is developed. By fitting the kinetic simulation to the
experimental data, the rate constant for the formation of ZA at the interface of aqueous aerosols
(krxn = 0.9 ± 0.2 × 10-3 M-1 · s-1) is obtained, and is estimated to be ~4 orders of magnitudes larger
than the reaction rate in bulk solutions. Simulated results reveal the bulk to interface partitioning

of PA and interface-enhanced condensation reaction lead to the observed accelerated ZA formation
in nanodroplets. Regarding the inherent reaction acceleration of PA at the liquid interface, there is
an important lingering question: what drives the reaction rate constant at the interface to be
significantly higher than the one in bulk? Although the exact reason for the enhancement is elusive,
there are possible explanations based on non-trivial physical properties at the interface including
electrostatic potential fluctuation, molecular orientation, surface acidity, and partial
solvation.12,15,58,59 Future studies about the detailed mechanism of dark PA condensation and the
energetics of the enhanced chemical reaction at the liquid-air interface will greatly benefit the
current understanding of the unique reactions in microcompartments under debate. Moreover,
surface-sensitive techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy60,61 and vibrational sumfrequency generation spectroscopy62 could be used to directly compare reaction kinetics in liquid
interface versus bulk.
