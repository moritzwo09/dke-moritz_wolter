Abstract

low concentration methane sources from agriculture.

There is significant climate and environmental
benefit to mitigating the environmental impacts
of livestock and biogas production. Methane
is a strong greenhouse gas that leads to global
warming, ammonia emissions pollute groundwater, and odor is a serious local problem which
is often regulated. There is a growing focus on
the reduction of global methane emissions, including public pledges by countries and food
companies. Although some solutions exist for
ammonia and odor removal, no scalable method
effectively treats methane from enteric fermentation or integrates the mitigation of all three
pollutants. It was found that MEPS, utilizing UV-light, chlorine gas and a NaOH scrubber, could remove 98 %, 94 %, and 80 % of
methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide (respectively) from the air in a pig barn. Tests in
a dairy barn found a quantum yield of 1.54%,
corresponding to a specific energy input of 0.5
kWh/gCH4 , when operating at a methane removal efficiency of 51 %. While there is much
room for optimization of the MEPS process,
this work demonstrates an important step in
developing scalable technology for eradicating

Synopsis
For the first time, a process removing methane,
ammonia, and odor from cattle and pig barn
air was demonstrated. the goal is to reduce
agriculture’s global warming impacts.

Introduction
Extensive efforts are underway to limit carbon
dioxide emissions and decarbonize the energy
supply. 1 In contrast, technology for reducing
methane emissions is less well-developed, despite methane’s total climate impact since the
industrial revolution being 2/3 as large as that
of carbon dioxide, 2 as well as methane’s contributions to tropospheric ozone pollution. 3 A new
report from the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering and Medicine has examined Atmospheric Methane Removal and concluded that
there are no commercially available technologies that operate at methane concentrations

below 1000 ppm. 4 An analysis by Abernethy
et al. 5 showed that 3/4 of all methane emissions occur at these dilute concentrations, including emissions from cattle, wastewater treatment plants, coal mine ventilation and waste
disposal. Recent work has shown that many
methane mitigation strategies are orders of
magnitude away from being feasible at scale, 6
and major breakthroughs in the performance of
photocatalysis and biofilter technology would
be required for these systems to have a large
mitigation impact. 5,6
Chemically, the oxidation of methane is well understood. Its oxidation is highly exothermic,
with the heat of combustion of methane being

tor to methane emissions from livestock, 16 with
some of the solutions for lowering emissions
being acidification 17 and frequent removal of
manure. 18 An alternative to avoiding the production of methane from manure is to enhance
it and use it as biogas, however methane leaks
during biogas production have been shown to
be significant, and can negate any climate benefits of biogas production. 19–22
The negative environmental impacts of livestock production extend beyond methane emissions and the derived impacts thereof. 23 Odor
compounds from cattle, pigs and biogas plants
adversely impact human health and the environment. Odor arises from a complex mix
of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and reduced sulfur gases including hydrogen sulfide.
Ammonia emissions have received particular
attention and regulation. Ammonia reacts
with atmospheric acids to form fine particulate matter linked to respiratory disease and
mortality. It damages ecosystems by forming
acid and causing eutrophication of waterways,
and where microbial processes can also lead to
increased nitrous oxide formation. Ammonia
can also react with hydroxyl radicals directly
in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of
nitrous oxide and further exacerbating global
warming. 24 With approximately 50 % of ammonia emissions originating from animals in
confined feeding operations, the eradication of
both ammonia and methane from these point
sources would positively impact global greenhouse gas balances in the atmosphere. 25
A new technology involving catalytic chain
reactions of gas phase radicals, the Methane
Eradication Photochemical System (MEPS)
has been introduced previously 26 and demonstrated under laboratory conditions. This system, based on chlorine atoms, was shown to
destroy methane with an energy input of 2.1
kWh/gCH4 , and a space velocity of 0.33 min−1 ,
for 50 ppm methane at a removal efficiency of
∼50 %. The idea is based on earlier work on
hydroxyl radical reactors, so-called gas phase
advanced oxidation. 27–30

Despite methane oxidation being exothermic,
there is a remarkable kinetic barrier. The CH bond in methane is the least reactive of
any hydrocarbon, resulting in methane having
the longest atmospheric lifetime of any hydrocarbon, around nine years. 8 This kinetic barrier may be overcome with catalysts, however
current candidates have their individual drawbacks. High temperature catalysts are generally performance limited by the Sabatier principle, and biofilters are performance limited
by rate, conditions, and avoidance of ammonia. 6,9,10 Photocatalysts are still orders of magnitude away from being economically and energetically feasible 5,6
To reduce agricultural methane emissions,
the addition of 3-NOP to feed has been shown
to lower emissions from enteric fermentation
in livestock, with methane emission reductions
of 13-32 %. 11–13 However, the long term effect
of the feed additive has been questioned, as
they seem to lose effectiveness over time, 14 but
these additives could still play an important
role in lowering near term methane emissions.
Setting aside the issue of societal acceptance, 15
the limited ability of feed additives to mitigate enteric methane emissions drives research
into more comprehensive methods for reducing
methane from agriculture. Manure is, along
with enteric fermentation, the largest contribu-

In the current study, we present results for

the performance of the MEPS process to both
oxidize methane, but also remove ammonia and
odor compounds in a real world setting. For
the first time, this technology was tested on air
samples live in the field. Air was processed from
a biogas plant, a dairy barn, and a pig barn,
and the process was run under continuous conditions. Operational performance, as well as
process yields and energy use were measured
and varied. Finally, we report on the impact
of the MEPS technology on the mitigation of
other co-pollutants (such as ammonia and odor
compounds) from these sources.

To avoid the possibility of chlorine leakage, the
system is run at under-pressure, with air being
drawn in by a fan (Lindab CK-250-C), capable
of pulling up to 270 L/min through the system.
Calculated average air residence times in the
photo-reactor were in the range 57-127 s.
The reactor performance was evaluated in the
field at the Aarhus University agricultural research center in Foulum, Denmark. Experiments were conducted to remove methane from
exhaust air in three separate environments: a
dairy barn (2 cows) with an experimental pointextraction system, a pig barn (26 pigs) - detalied description by Dalby et al., 33 and the ventilation air of a biogas production plant (sampled
after its odor biofilter), as earlier described by
Sadegh et al. 34 The prototype was placed inside
the barns and the ventilation room, allowing for
real time processing of the air streams. The system operated for several hours at a time, and
sensor data was recorded at one-minute intervals.

Methods
The MEPS laboratory-scale prototype is a photoreactor that uses chlorine radicals (chlorine
atoms, Cl• ) to initiate the breakdown of CH4 .
The process is shown in Figure 1. The methaneladen air is drawn from the specific environment
through 40 mm PVC piping. The air is initially
led through a counter-flow water scrubber to
remove any large particles and physical debris.
Subsequently, chlorine gas, produced by electrolysis of NaCl, is added to the airflow, using
a ’CHLORINSITU IV Compact’-system from
Prominent. 31 After the addition of molecular
chlorine gas, the air flows into the photoreactor.
The reactor has a size of 0.25 m3 (1 m x 0.5 m
x 0.5 m) and is lined with polished aluminum
for UV reflectivity, which is covered with a 125
µm film of PFA (perfluoroalkoxy polymer) for
chemical resistance. The reactor is illuminated
at both ends with LEDs (light emitting diodes)
with a peak emission wavelength at 368 nm,
shown in Figure. 2. Each end of the reactor has
eight printed circuit boards containing 9 LEDs
each, totaling 144 LEDs. 260 W of power is applied in total, with a 35 % electrical power to
photon efficiency, 32 and powered by a variable
DC supply. Following the photoreactor, the air
travels into a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) counterflow scrubber that removes residual molecular chlorine and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which
is produced as a by-product of methane oxidation. The chlorine-free airflow is then vented.

Measurements
13 experiments were conducted, 3 in a dairy
barn, 4 in a pig barn, and 6 at a biogas plant.
The experiments varied in length from 10 to
62 minutes, the average values for all experiments can be found in the supporting information, Table S3. The inlet and outlet of
the system were monitored for concentrations
of CH4 and background compounds. Methane
was measured through real-time tunable diode
laser spectroscopy (TDLS) using an Axetris
LGD compact-A CH4 sensor (10 ppb resolution). The inlet methane concentration was adjusted to correct for a small leak of air into
the system by comparing the inlet and outlet
concentrations when no chlorine or UV light
was applied in the reactor (control). Average
values were calculated for each experiment, excluding the first and last two data points due
to system response delays. Some experiments
were discarded from the barn experiments as
methane concentrations were unstable due to
variable animal behavior. The identification
and quantification of low concentration odor related compounds in the pig barn air and MEPS

reactor was performed using an online Proton
Transfer Reaction - Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) (Ionicon Analytik, Innsbruck, Austria). PTR-MS is a highly sensitive
method based on the ionization of gaseous compounds by protonated water, H3 O+ , in a drift
tube and subsequent detection of the ionized
species by a quadrupole mass spectrometer, detecting ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio
(m/z ). The voltage, temperature, and pressure
of the drift tube were set at 600 V, 75 o C, and
2.1 mbar. The E/N number was approximately
145 Td in all experiments. The concentrations
have been corrected for rate constant contributions as described in the Supporting Information, using rate constants from Cappellin et
al, 35 along with calculations by the method proposed by Su. 36 The PTR-MS measured odorants with a dwell time of 0.2 seconds and the detection limit for the different compounds ranged
from 0.02 to 1 ppb, depending on the compound. 37 Air was pumped into the PTR-MS
through a 1/8th inch PTFE tube. An electrochemical cell, a ’Membrapor Chlorine Gas Sensor Cl2/C-200’, was used to monitor chlorine
in the exhaust from the MEPS system, to ensure any emissions were below 1 ppm. Chlorine
safety sensors with alarms were also placed near
the system.

of methane oxidation was achieved in pig barn
air (80-100%), at low initial methane concentrations. Methane oxidation from biogas plant
air ranged from 44-73%, with initial concentrations ranging from 18-46 ppm. Even with
co-pollutants present, the oxidation of methane
seems effective.

Results and Discussion
Methane Oxidation
The MEPS reactor was capable of removing
methane from all three air sources via the addition of both chlorine gas and UV light simultaneously to the air streams. Figure 3 shows
data from a typical experiment, displaying how
the combination of light and chlorine in the
air stream removed methane. The removal of
methane is shown by the difference between the
inlet and outlet concentrations (Figure 3).
The amount of methane that was oxidized under various conditions and for the different air
sources is displayed in Figure 4, as a function
of the initial methane concentration. Due to
the nature of field experiments, initial methane
concentrations were not controlled, and therefore the system was operated with a wide range
of initial methane concentrations. Between 38
and 52 % of inlet air methane was oxidized
from dairy barn ventilation air, over a concentration range of 70 to 90 ppm. A high level

Apparent Quantum Yield
While Figure 4 may appear to show that the
MEPS is more efficient at removing methane
at lower concentrations, it is necessary to investigate the apparent quantum yield (AQY)
and the energy efficiency of this methane removal to better understand MEPS as a cost
and energy effective process for methane removal. The AQY is one of the main metrics
used to evaluate methane mitigation technologies initiated by photons. 5 AQY is calculated by
comparing the number of photons added to the
system with the number of methane molecules
oxidized, as shown by equation 2, where nCH4
is the number of methane molecules oxidized,
e is the energy efficiency of the LEDs (35 %),
Pinput is the power input to the LEDs, λ is the
wavelength of the LEDs, h is Planck’s constant

process from the current setup. The highest
AQY was achieved in the dairy barn, and at
the highest concentration of methane encountered in the field. This is consistent with increased reaction rate at high methane concentration and lesser impact of side reactions with
other constituents. Light intensity was held
relatively constant throughout all of the experiments, leading to a non-optimized light to
chemical reactants ratio. Future improvements
to the process may include optimization of light
and thus energy inputs into the system, especially with respect to inlet methane concentrations.

Energy Efficiency
To compare our results with those of the literature, we look at the energy efficiency of the process. The energy efficiency is calculated using
the energy used to power the LEDs, the electrolysis (chlorine production), pumps for circulation of water in the scrubbers, and the fan
pulling air through the system. The total energy consumption was then compared to how
much methane was removed, as shown in Figure 6.
The results of this study are shown in comparison with the results reported by Krogsbøll
et al. 26 in 2023. Due to improvements in
the reactor design including reactor geometry,
lamp placement and lining, we see improved
energy efficiency at equivalent removal efficiencies, and higher removal efficiencies at equivalent energy inputs. The best energy efficiency
found was 0.50 kWh/gCH4 , at a methane concentration of 90 ppm. This is comparable to
theoretical best case costs of thermo-catalytic
methane oxidation (estimated from the literature at 0.51 kWh/gCH4 for 100 ppm methane
concentrations). 40 Even at this small scale, the
technology already shows cost competitiveness
with best case scenarios for thermo-catalytic
methane oxidation. Three main factors to investigate before implementation would be the
required carbon intensity of the electricity used,
along with the societal and individual cost of
methane emissions, all of which would depend
on the application site.

Figure 5: Apparent Quantum Yield as a function of methane concentration. The Uncertainties shown are 1σ.
The highest AQY for the MEPS was found
to be 1.54 %, as shown in Figure 5, meaning
that 1.54 % of the photons generated by the
LEDs, oxidized a methane molecule. To the
best of our knowledge, this is by far the highest apparent quantum yield for methane oxidation ever recorded, and is the first within the
range of 9 ± 8 % set as the goal by Abernethy
et al. although further development is warranted. 5,38,39 The theoretically highest achievable AQY is calculated from the number of
chlorine radicals that can be created from a
single photon, 2, and the reaction efficiency of
chlorine radicals oxidizing methane (2.5 chlorine radicals/methane molecule), due to chlorine reacting with the products of the initial
oxidation, 26 not accounting for wall reactions
or reactions with co-pollutants the maximum
achievable AQY is therefore 80 %. Thus there is
significant space for optimization of the MEPS

We expect that scaling up the MEPS technology will lead to reductions in specific energy
usage and improved process optimization, and
thus improve both process economics and the
energy efficiency of the system.

Removal of Ammonia, Hydrogen
Sulfide and VOC
Livestock production contributes to the emission of malodorous volatile compounds, which
create nuisance for farming communities. 41
These emissions are primarily from microbial
decomposition of organic material and proteins
found in manure, along with H2 S from microbial
sulfate reduction. 37 Studies have characterized
emissions from livestock farming, including pig
barns. 37,42 This study measured a comprehensive spectrum of odor compounds as a function
of time using PTR-MS in a pig barn and evaluated the influence of MEPS on these emissions.

is varied (shown by the color). The results of
this work are compared to the results published
by Krogsbøll et al. 26

values (OTVs). 42,43

While this demonstration of the MEPS technology shows promise as an effective and scalable method for methane oxidation in low
methane concentration environments, there remains significant space for the improvement of
the process and process optimization. In the
current prototype reactor, chlorine concentration, light intensity, and residence time (the
three primary control variables) were not controlled in relation to methane concentration,
and thus further work can be done to optimize
these inputs to reduce energy and resource use,
while maximizing methane oxidation. In theory, these variables could be controlled based
on varying concentrations of methane in the
inlet streams for optimal reaction kinetics. In
larger scale deployments of the MEPS technology, the physical dimensions of the photoreactor itself will increase the average photon pathlength, leading to more efficient chlorine radical formation per unit light, further increasing
the AQY and energy efficiency. Due to the dimensional limitations of the current prototype,
these gains can first be realized at larger scales.

The concentrations of the odorants decreased
significantly upon activation of the system (Figure 7), demonstrating its efficiency in mitigating strong livestock odorants. The prototype removed over 70 % of all above mentioned compounds. Notably, highly odorous
compounds like butanoic acid, carboxylic acid,
and 4-methylphenol with concentrations significantly exceeding their OTVs, were reduced by
over 90% (Figure 7). Ammonia and hydrogen

emissions, for ammonia mainly due to eutrophication, secondary PM, soil acidification, biodiversity loss, and secondary GHG production,
whereas H2 S is odorous and contributes to sulfate particles. 41 They are products of anaerobic microbial decomposition of protein and
sulfur compounds in manure. 37 Inlet concentrations of ammonia (∼3460 ppb) and hydrogen sulfide (∼360 ppb) far exceed their OTVs
(1500 ppb for ammonia). 42 Comparable concentrations are reported in the literature. 42,44
The system showed excellent removal efficiencies of 94 % for ammonia and 99% for hydrogen sulfide (Figure 7). The ammonia is removed partially from the scrubbers and partly
from the photoreactor. It was not possible
to distinguish the removal of hydrogen sulfide
from the NaOH scrubber compared to the photoreactor; however, NaOH has formerly been
used to remove H2 S. 45 As can be seen in the
supplementary information, other compounds
were also significantly removed, although their
higher OTVs may make them of lesser con-

cern. While the system effectively mitigated
odorants, it led to increased concentrations of
certain compounds. The compounds which increase in concentration are not found to have a
GWP or strong odor. Chloroacetone is found to
be toxic to humans, but its concentration is 100
times below the threshold limit values (TLV)
for 8 hours exposure, 46 and is therefore not a
concern. Chloroamines are found to be produced at concentrations up to 25 ppb, which is
well below the limit set for the working environment in a swimming pool of 0.3 mg/m3 . 47 Compounds such as m/z 45 (acetaldehyde), m/z
55 (butanal), m/z 87 (2,3-butanedione), and
m/z 129 (octanone) showed minimal changes
in concentration (SI). Acetaldehyde and 2,3butanedione are strong odorants with OTVs of
1.5 ppb and 0.05 ppb, 42 respectively, and inlet
concentrations of 10–20 ppb and 2–8 ppb.

Although this field test has focused on ventilation air from a dairy and pig barn and biogas
plant, the method is general and could be used
for other sources of dilute methane, including
ventilation air from coal mines, landfills, and
wastewater treatment plants. As a class of reactor, gas phase radicals are able to overcome obstacles in converting light energy to chemical reactivity due to the lack of phase change. Photocatalysts have a quantum efficiency of 0.001%. 5
In contrast the current study achieved a quantum yield of up to 1.54%, and the theoretical
limit is much higher, potentially 80%. One reason behind this high efficiency is the formation
of two radicals when Cl2 absorbs one photon of
light. Furthermore the reaction rate of methane
with chlorine is 16 times quicker than the reaction of methane with OH. 48 We believe that
the main loss of energy in the system is wall
loss, as the optical depth of the system is longer
than the dimension of the reactor. The optical
pathlength of the chlorine can be calculated by

and the absorption cross section (acs) of 1∗1019
