Abstract
Toxic industrial chemicals and untreated sewage have polluted the Tijuana River for decades,
recently causing over 1,000 consecutive days of California beach closures. In the summer of
2024, wastewater flows surged to millions of gallons per day despite no rain, enhancing waterto-air hydrogen sulfide (H2S) transfer at a turbulent hotspot. High wastewater flows and low
winds led to nighttime H₂S peaks, reaching 4,500 parts-per-billion (ppb)—exceeding typical
urban levels of 1 ppb. H₂S levels and community malodor reports were strongly correlated (r =
0.92), validating long-dismissed community voices and highlighting an environmental injustice
issue. This study demonstrates that poor water quality can significantly impact air quality—
though rarely included in air quality models and health assessments—with widespread
implications as polluted waterways increase globally.

The 4,532-km² Tijuana River Valley, spanning the western U.S.-Mexico border, has been the
epicenter of a worsening environmental and public health crisis over many decades. The heavily
polluted Tijuana River, containing untreated sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater runoff,
crosses the border and flows through the Tijuana River Estuary before emptying into the Pacific
Ocean at the southern edge of San Diego County(1, 2). The Tijuana Watershed has been
classified as an impaired water body under the U.S. Clean Water Act, with over 1,000 days of
recent beach closures and significant impacts on public health, the environment, and the region’s
economy(3). During the rainy season, November-March, river flows can reach billions of gallons
per day. Until recently, dry season flows (June-September) have been negligible except after rare
summer rain events. The ongoing water pollution crisis in the Tijuana River Watershed has been
exacerbated by the winter arrival of record high numbers of intense Atmospheric Rivers in 2023
and 2024, damaging already aging and inadequate wastewater infrastructure on both sides of the
border (4, 5). Additionally, coastal discharge of treated and untreated sewage coming from Punta
Bandera—a major wastewater outfall located 10 km south of the border—often flows northward
during the summer swell, adding to the polluted coastline from Imperial Beach north to other
coastal San Diego communities (5-9).
Health concerns regarding pollution in the Tijuana River Watershed have primarily focused on
direct exposure to contaminated water—either by drinking polluted water or by entering the
ocean for recreational activities (10-12). However, many processes transfer water pollutants to
air including bursting bubbles in waterfalls, turbulence in rivers, aeration in wastewater treatment
plants, toilet flushing, and breaking waves in coastal surf zones which form aerosols in a process
known as aerosolization(13-16). Studies have shown that water pollutants, bacteria, viruses,
pathogens, and fungal spores can become enriched in the aerosolization process (17-24). In
addition to aerosolization, gaseous pollutants can partition from water-to-air (25, 26). Airborne
pollutants can then be dispersed by winds over distances of miles, increasing the number of
people exposed to these contaminants beyond just those in direct contact with the polluted water.
Further, humans inhale 11,000 L of air per day compared to drinking 2 L per day of often filtered
water, potentially rendering inhalation the largest exposure pathway to many of these waterderived pollutants(27, 28). The nature and magnitude of heavily contaminated river and ocean
water on air quality and human health have long been overlooked while water pollution,
anthropogenic runoff, and local flooding are increasing due to population growth, aging
infrastructure, and climate change(29).
This study presents a compelling example of how water pollution does not always stay within the
banks of a polluted river or waterway. The health impacts of pollutants and pathogens transferred
from heavily polluted waters into the atmosphere represent a major gap in our knowledge (30,
31). Since more than half of the world's population lives near rivers, lakes, and oceans(32), better
understanding and monitoring are needed to address the ways that pollution moves from water
bodies to surrounding air masses and, ultimately, neighborhoods and beyond. More broadly, the
impact of water pollution on air quality, including emerging air contaminants of concern,
represents a critical yet under-explored public health issue with significant implications for a
large portion of humanity(33).

Identifying the Tijuana River H2S and Malodor Hotspot

In a previous winter season study at Imperial Beach, we used genomic sequencing to show that
up to 76% of airborne bacteria could be directly traced to the contaminated Tijuana River(34).
This study extends our focus to include gases and aerosols in the same region during summer
when negligible flows in the Tijuana River were expected.
Air quality measurements initially commenced at a coastal site near the U.S.-Mexico border,
specifically at Border Field State Park (indicated by the blue square in Fig. 1), which can be
impacted by pollution in the summer from Punta Bandera (8). However, input from residents in
inland communities—including reports of malodors and health symptoms—helped us identify a
turbulent and foamy site along the Tijuana River that was visible in satellite imagery (Fig. 1 and
S1-2). Based on findings in previous wastewater management flow studies, we hypothesized that
turbulence at this riverine hotspot was leading to enhanced H2S emissions, and other gases,
aerosols, and associated malodors (35-39). Consequently, we moved our mobile air quality
laboratory approximately 5 km inland to the community of Nestor, the closest neighborhood to
the river hotspot (red triangle in Fig. 1) and near a high density of K-12 schools (Fig. S3). Nestor
air measurements began on September 1, 2024, and included the criteria pollutants ozone, carbon
monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), particulate matter (PM₁, PM₂.₅), as well as hydrogen sulfide
(H₂S).

H2S: A Toxic Sewage Gas and Airborne Tracer of Water Pollution

For decades, communities near the Tijuana River Valley have reported malodors and health
symptoms. Despite overwhelming community concerns, quantitative air quality measurements
have never been conducted with sufficient resolution to identify the specific air pollutants
causing the malodors and address the adverse health effects in this region. H₂S, known for its
distinctive "rotten egg" smell and low odor threshold (40), is the most common gaseous tracer of
sewage. In this study, we used H₂S as a general marker to trace malodors and other airborne
contaminants produced from sewage-laden waters. Produced by the anaerobic decomposition of
organic matter, H₂S can be toxic even at relatively low levels(41). The CDC's Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) reports that urban ambient H₂S levels are typically
below 1 part-per-billion (ppb)(42, 43). Respiratory irritation and neurological effects can occur at
higher exposure levels(44). California Air Resources Board (CARB) set a 1-hr average
California Air Quality Standard (CAAQS) of 30 ppb for the purpose of odor control. The South
Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) uses this same 30 ppb for acute exposure.
The California Office of Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and SCAQMD use a chronic
exposure limit of 7.3 ppb for chronic exposure levels, particularly for vulnerable populations
(e.g., pregnant women, children, older adults, immunocompromised).
One-hour average H2S levels at the Border Field coastal site (top panel), as well as the Nestor
neighborhood site (bottom panel), are shown in Fig. 2. Measured levels are shown relative to the
30 ppb 1-hr average CAAQS for H2S. During the August 24-25 sampling period at Border Field,
H₂S levels remained below the CAAQS (Fig. 2 A-D). From September 7-8 at the Nestor site,
H2S levels routinely exceeded the CAAQS. The polar plots clearly demonstrate that the
proximity of Nestor to the riverine hotspot led to much higher H2S levels than Border Field,
particularly during low-wind and stagnant-air nighttime conditions (Fig. 2 E-F).

Unprecedented Dry Summer Season Flows in 2024

140

145

150

In the past two rainy seasons, unusually high numbers of winter storms with intense rainfall
resulted in record transboundary annual flows of 44 billion gallons in 2023 and 35 billion gallons
(to date) in 2024 (Fig. 3A and S4). The two corresponding dry seasons also had higher annual
flows than previous years (Fig. 3B-F). The impact of Hurricane Hillary in the summer of 2023
resulted in higher than normal August flows (Fig. 3E). The reason for the unprecedented high
dry season flows in summer of 2024, in the absence of rain, is not known. While high rainy
season flows are diluted by rainfall, dry season flows are typically low due to minimal
rainfall(45). As shown in Fig. 3F, unprecedented high river flows were recorded throughout
most of the 2024 dry season, ranging between 40-80 million gallons per day. On September 10,
pump stations in Mexico were suddenly activated. This diversion of wastewater effectively
reduced transboundary flows, with daytime flows dropping to nearly zero and nighttime flows
diminishing to less than 5 million gallons per day (Fig. 3F inset and S5). High-resolution, 15min flow data show after this abrupt wastewater management decision on September 10,
wastewater discharge to the river occurred only during nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 4 a.m.) for the
remainder of the 2024 dry season (Fig. 3F inset and S5).

Record High Dry Season Flows Drive Toxic H₂S Levels and Community Malodor
Reports

170

Measurements in the Nestor community were conducted to quantify community airborne
exposure to the identified local Tijuana River H2S hotspot. See Fig. S6 for the full timeline of
events related to this study. Time series of H2S levels measured at Nestor from September 1-22
are shown in Fig. 4. During the period with the highest river flows (September 5-9), 1-min
averaged H2S levels surged at night to 4,500 times typical urban ambient levels (Fig. 4A).
Following the September 10 wastewater diversion, H2S levels dropped by roughly 95%.
However, H₂S levels still peaked at night when river flows were highest due to controlled
nighttime releases when wind speeds and temperatures were at their lowest (Fig. S7-9).

Meteorological conditions led to reduced dispersion and atmospheric dilution of H₂S, trapping
the gas (which is heavier than air) near the ground in nearby communities between ~6 pm each
night and ~8 am the next morning (Fig. S10-11).

Residents living in south San Diego and Imperial Beach communities reported increasing and
ultimately record-high numbers of daily malodor reports (Fig. 4B) and health symptoms (e.g.,
respiratory problems, headaches, anxiety, and fatigue) to the San Diego Air Pollution Control
District (SDAPCD). These malodor reports were typically made during the nighttime or early
morning hours. The sudden wastewater diversion and corresponding decrease in H₂S levels on
September 10 were directly reflected in malodor reports, which decreased from 233 daily reports
on September 9 to fewer than 10 by September 12. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong
positive correlation (r = 0.92) between H₂S levels and community malodor reports (Fig. S12).
The strong temporal correlation between the polluted Tijuana River flow and ambient H₂S levels
in Nestor supports the hypothesis that the turbulent hotspot was the primary source of malodors
and H₂S emissions.
Framing the H2S measurements in a regulatory context, 1-hr average H2S levels reached 2,100
ppb (Fig. 4B), nearly 70 times the 1-hr CAAQS of 30 ppb. Fig. 4C illustrates the number of
hours in a 24-hr period that residents in Nestor were exposed to H₂S levels above the CAAQS.
Before the intentional wastewater diversion, residents experienced between 5 to 14 hours of
exposure above the CAAQS, largely at night, with 1-hr average H₂S levels ranging from 30 to
2,100 ppb. As shown in the inset in Fig. 4B and in Fig. 4C, after the wastewater was diverted,
while H2S levels decreased significantly, residents still experienced up to five hours of exposure
above the CAAQS on most nights. While the duration of this study allows direct comparison
with acute exposure standards, assessing chronic exposure would be appropriate only if these
three weeks of measurements were representative of the typical air quality conditions over
months to years. The OEHHA/SCAQMD chronic exposure limit of 7.3 ppb is also included in
Fig. 4B for reference.

Air Dispersion of Pollutants Broadens Tijuana River Impact to Regional Scale

High temporal resolution measurements in this study capture the impact of the Tijuana River
pollution on Nestor, a local community closest to the turbulent river hotspot. Therefore, to
investigate the extent to which pollution from the Tijuana River can impact air quality in
neighboring communities and beyond, HYSPLIT (47) trajectory and dispersion modeling was
used. The 1-hr average Tijuana River flow rates were used to estimate H2S emissions, capturing
the effect of increased flow on source strength, as well as turbulence at the river hotspot.
Dispersion modeling allows further study of the factors affecting the spatial distribution of
airborne pollutants emanating from the river hotspot, including river source strength and
meteorology. Fig. 5 illustrates the regional impact of H2S emissions from the Tijuana River

crossing at Saturn Boulevard. Relative levels of potentially degraded air masses were binned into
three time periods with distinct flow and meteorological conditions: high river flow during
moderate-temperature conditions from September 1 through September 5 (Period 1); high river
flow during atmospherically stagnant conditions from September 6 through 12:00 pm on
September 10 (Period 2); and reduced river flow with westerly winds over the remainder of the
study from 12:01 pm September 10 through September 22 (Period 3). The cutoff between
periods 2 and 3 was set to noon on September 10, since the wastewater diversion occurred that
morning.
As shown in Fig. 5, high river flow periods at the beginning of September resulted in higher
airborne pollutant levels near the hotspot river source region (shown as a black point in all
panels). Compared to Period 1, Period 2 nighttime boundary layer winds were weaker, resulting
in the highest H2S buildup in and around Nestor and surrounding communities (Fig. 5A, 5B).
Higher river flows starting in the evening hours reproduced the nightly increases of H2S in
Nestor, showing earlier and higher levels in Period 2 (Fig. 5D, 5E). Reduced flows occurring
after the wastewater diversion led to reduction in H2S emissions during Period 3. Along with
more consistent westerly winds, reduced river flow contributed to a greatly reduced density of
weighted trajectories over the study region, with nighttime peaks only a fraction of those seen
during high river flow conditions (Fig. 5C, 5F). It is important to note that weighting summed
trajectories by the 1-hr average river flows was necessary to reproduce these measured trends at
Nestor across the three time periods (i.e., meteorology alone without flow-based weighting did
not reproduce the trends), further confirming the Saturn Boulevard riverine hotspot as the major
source region driving local emissions of H2S and other airborne pollutants.

Polluted Water Bodies as Emission Sources for Air Quality Modeling
This study demonstrates the major impact a turbulent portion of a polluted river can have on
regional air quality—a finding with global implications as many countries grapple with
waterways contaminated by increasing levels of untreated sewage and industrial waste.

250

255

The severity of water pollution in the Tijuana River was visibly marked by foam accumulating
on the river surface, starting at the Saturn Boulevard hotspot and extending miles through the
Tijuana Estuary, peaking each morning and often persisting throughout the day (Figs. S1-2).
Another global example of similar persistent foam layers has been reported in the Yamuna River
in New Delhi, which has been attributed to a similar combination of industrial pollutants and raw
wastewater(48, 49). These surface foams have been shown to contain untreated waste, industrial
chemicals, metals, and surfactants that accumulate on the water's surface(48, 49). Similar
foaming phenomena have also been documented in gravity sewer networks, where dry weather
flows and turbulence have been shown to amplify H₂S emissions (35-39).

Air trajectory modeling supports the impact of polluted transboundary river flow—serving as a
proxy for source strength of water-derived pollutants. Specifically an increase in volume levels
and enhanced turbulence-driven partitioning—coupled with meteorological conditions, on the
observed H₂S levels. It is important to note that H2S is only one of potentially thousands of other
pollutants emitted from the Tijuana River and impacting regional health across San Diego
County and beyond(50). Both measurements and models demonstrate that fluctuations in wind
speed and direction, on timescales of hours to days, influenced the variability of H₂S and likely
other co-emitted pollutants. Therefore, routine air quality measurements that capture these spatial
and temporal variations, especially near turbulent zones with waterfalls and sewer drop-offs, are
needed to serve as inputs for air quality models, assess neighborhood-scale air quality, and
address public health concerns. Such measurements are critical for advancing current estimates
of the effects of public health consequences of water pollution, which do not consider inhalation
pathways and degradation of air quality.

275

This study underscores the pressing need to enhance our understanding of how pollutants move
between environmental reservoirs, in this case polluted water and air. Current air quality models
do not include gaseous emissions from polluted rivers, estuaries, and coastal systems—areas
increasingly impacted by anthropogenic pollution. Incorporating emissions from polluted water
bodies will be essential for accurate predictions of health impacts of environmental pollution and
developing effective mitigation strategies. As human population growth continues to drive
pollution to levels that strain and exceed Earth's natural capacity for processing, understanding
these transfer mechanisms has become essential for addressing pollution impacts both locally
and globally.

Addressing Environmental Justice and Protecting Public Health

Residents living near the Tijuana River Valley have endured the impacts of environmental water
pollution since the 1930s, with escalating impacts in recent years(51). The H2S levels measured
in this study support the decades of concerns raised by the residents living near the Tijuana River
Valley, who have had less attention and slower acknowledgment than other communities
experiencing similar levels of H2S exposure. A parallel can be drawn with the air quality crisis in
Carson, California in 2021(44, 52, 53), where residents were subjected to malodors related to
high H2S levels. In that emergency, the SCAQMD investigated and responded rapidly providing
air filtration units, while local authorities moved to investigate to rapidly identify and eliminate
the H2S source. In order to respond to community exposure to toxic air pollutants, SCAQMD has
implemented a community air monitoring program (CAMP) as part of Rule 1180 at multiple
sites across Los Angeles county with real-time publicly accessible display and rapid response
communication to warn communities when high levels multiple toxic gases, including H2S, are
reached to reduce community exposure(54).
Chronic exposure to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and other air pollutants released from untreated
wastewater can help explain many of the longstanding health symptoms reported in the South
Bay San Diego and Imperial Beach region, including respiratory and gastrointestinal issues,
headaches, fatigue, skin infections, nausea, and anxiety. However, limited research exists on the
long-term effects of inhaling H₂S and the complex mixture of airborne pollutants originating
from polluted water sources. Research has shown similar health effects experienced by
wastewater treatment plant workers and people living in communities near wastewater treatment
plants(55-57). The demographics of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego communities of Nestor

and San Ysidro, align with the definition of environmental justice communities (58). These areas
have high Hispanic/Latino populations ranging from 53% to 93%, and, additionally, a significant
portion of residents live below the poverty line (59, 60). Besides the social stressors that the
community endures, environmental pollution leads to cumulative impacts (61) on the local
economy, health, and overall quality-of-life. Such prolonged exposure without adequate
protection or timely intervention highlights a clear environmental injustice that would not be
tolerated in more affluent or less marginalized communities.

Given that H2S levels peak at night, providing effective indoor air filtration represents a practical
short-term solution. For the filters to be effective, they must include activated carbon with
potassium permanganate to reduce H₂S and other toxic gases, along with particulate filters to
reduce exposure to aerosolized pollutants including viruses, bacteria, and fungal spores. In
addition to filtration, implementing a community air monitoring program—similar to CAMP
established by the SCAQMD—is essential for protecting public health. Such measures are
fundamental to safeguarding community health by providing real-time data on air quality and
enabling timely responses to unacceptable pollution events (54, 62).
Providing readily accessible air quality data with educational support empowers residents to
make informed decisions. Still, comprehensive water quality improvements—including
infrastructure upgrades and stricter water pollution controls enforced by both the U.S. and
Mexico—are essential. This study demonstrates that water pollution does not stop at the river's
edge; therefore, the benefits of water quality management and repairing polluted waterways
extend beyond the immediate water users—both human and ecological—themselves. While the
ultimate solution for affected residents involves eliminating the contamination, regardless of the
original source of pollution, building the infrastructure to support this will take years and
substantial resources. In the meantime, a relatively quick remedy is to eliminate the turbulence at
the Saturn Boulevard H₂S hotspot, where this study shows significant emissions are occurring.
Without critical interventions, residents living on both sides of the border will continue to suffer
unacceptable health impacts due to poor air quality. Continuous monitoring and coordinated
action among public agencies are imperative and must include community engaged solutions to
be effective. Sustained commitment and collaboration are necessary to protect the communities
suffering from this increasing environmental pollution by providing the resources they urgently
need and deserve.
