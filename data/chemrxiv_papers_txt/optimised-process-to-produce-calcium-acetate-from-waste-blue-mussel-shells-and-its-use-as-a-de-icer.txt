Abstract
The preparation of calcium acetate from mussel (Mytilus edulis) shells and acetic acid was
optimised via design of experiments. The solid product was identified as the monohydrate via
powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric analysis. Comparisons were
made to optical grade calcite in place of the bio-sourced calcium carbonate for the synthesis. An
exploratory central composite design compared the yield of calcium acetate with respect to shell
material used (shells dried in air at room temperature, dried at 220 °C or calcined), concentration
of acetic acid, and time. The yield of Ca(CH₃COO)₂·H₂O was optimized further using heated,
crushed shells using a custom optimal design. A maximum yield of 93% was reached after 32 h
using 9% v/v CH₃COOH or an 85% yield using food-grade white vinegar after 24 h. De-icing

experiments showed that Ca(CH₃COO)₂·H₂O produced from waste blue mussel shells melted 6
wt.% of ice at a concentration of 30% (m/v). For comparison, 11 wt.% defrosted using CaCl2
30% (m/v) and 13 wt.% defrosted using NaCl 30% (m/v).

Introduction
Mussel shells are a valuable source of CaCO3 (> 95%) and as such have been valorized in many
applications where CaCO3 is used.1-3 One area where mollusc shells have been underutilized is as
a starting material for synthesis. This may be due to purity issues, as molluscs contain organic
matter including silk fibroin-like proteins, acidic glycoproteins and β-chitin. Furthermore, studies
have shown that there are also small amounts of other minerals present that leads to the presence
of the following metals Pb, Hg, Cr, Mg and Fe.4, 5 Barro et al. developed a plant in Spain to make
high purity CaCO3 (> 95%) by calcining mussel shells up to 600 °C.6 The resulting CaCO3
contained MgCO3 and organic carbon as the largest contaminants.
Calcium acetate (Ca(CH3COO)2) can be made by reacting CaCO3 or CaO with acetic acid
(CH3COOH). Ca(CH3COO)2 can be used medicinally to treat high levels of phosphate in dialysis
patients.7 Ca(CH3COO)2 can also be used in the preparation of hydroxyapatite,8 which is used for
biomedical applications such as bone and coatings of metal implants, and is an approved food
additive in Canada, as an acidity regulator.9 Ca(CH3COO)2 can be used as an environmentally
friendly de-icer in place of NaCl, however, it is currently not a commercial de-icer. A de-icer is a
chemical, mainly salts, that are effective at removing ice or snow and preventing the formation of
ice by reducing the freezing point of water.10 In Canada and much of North America, the use of
de-icing agents is critical to keep roadways safe and open during the winter months. The use of
road salts minimizes traffic accidents, injuries and deaths during ice and snow conditions. 11 Road

salt (mainly NaCl) has been used as a de-icing agent in Canada since the 1940s.12 On average, 5
million tonnes of road salt are used each winter to keep roadways across the country safe. There
are several concerns with the use of road salt regarding the environment, infrastructure, and human
health. The use of road salts is linked to the salinization of fresh water and corrosion.13 NaCl is
corrosive and non-degradable. Layers of differing densities can exist in lakes due to high salt
concentrations and it causes depletion of oxygen in deeper regions of lakes due to incomplete
seasonal mixing. This improper mixing leads to the inability of the lake to distribute valuable
nutrients to the lake as well and may lead to ecosystem changes. Prolonged chloride concentrations
in excess of 250 mg/L is detrimental to aquatic life.14 Increases in sodium concentrations
accelerates the growth of blue-green algae which makes freshwater sources prone to algal blooms.
Acetate-based de-icers, such as biodegradable and non-corrosive calcium magnesium acetate
(CaMg2(CH3COO)6), can also affect the environment. The biodegradation of the acetate ion causes
a depletion of oxygen which can cause plant death. The harmful effects of any type of road salt
are mainly observed in slow moving waterways where dilution is slow. 15 Acetate based de-icers
also affect the integrity of concrete16 but not to the same degree as chloride based de-icers.10
CaMg2(CH3COO)6 is 30 times more expensive than rock salt (NaCl) and made from the reaction
of dolomite (CaCO3 with at least 5% MgCO3) with CH3COOH.17 As a result, CaMg2(CH3COO)6
is less commonly used on highways and its use is limited to environmentally sensitive regions
including bridges.18 However, the use of renewable feedstocks, such as by-products from the food
industry, can make acetate-based de-icers cheaper. De-icers have been made from renewable
sources of organic and inorganic materials. CaMg2(CH3COO)6 and calcium magnesium
propionate have been prepared via fermentation,18 Ca(CH3COO)2 has been made using bamboo
vinegar,19 and a variety of de-icers have been made using degradation products from corn steep

water.20 These show organic materials can be sourced from fermentation of biomass and does not
need to be sourced from oil resources. Ca(CH3COO)2 has previously been prepared using mollusc
shells.21-24 Ca(CH3COO)2 has been prepared using waste oyster shells and food-grade applications
were targetted,23, 24 and other researchers have targeted de-icing applications using waste oysters
or clam shell powder.21, 22 There was a language barrier in understanding some of the literature.22,
24 Herein, we describe the synthesis of Ca(CH COO)
3

from waste blue mussel (BM) shells and

the use of this material as a de-icing agent. Ca(CH3COO)2 is currently not on the market as an antiice or de-icing agent. Few studies have been performed on calcium acetate as a de-icer,19 but it has
been reported that Ca(CH3COO)2 has a lower freezing point than NaCl (based on same molarity
solutions), is an effective de-icer and is less corrosive than NaCl.19 The use of mussel shells in the
preparation of a bio-degradable road salt has the potential to change the outlook on NaCl use in
rural communities where mussel processing occurs. Design of experiments (DoE) methodology
was used herein to investigate three factors believed to be most influential to a green synthesis of
calcium acetate using waste BM shells and to optimize the yield of Ca(CH 3COO)2. The
Ca(CH3COO)2 products were characterized and experiments to test its de-icing capability are
presented alongside results for more typical de-icers, namely NaCl (rock salt) and CaCl2.

Results and Discussion
Typically, when molluscs have been employed as catalysts, adsorbents, or amendments, they have
been ground into a fine powder.3 The reaction of ground mussel shells with acetic acid was
evaluated for the synthesis of Ca(CH3COO)2. Unfortunately, shells ground in a stainless-steel
mixer mill had visible iron contamination. For example, the resultant mixture of mussel shells and
acetic acid was black, and even after filtering the Ca(CH 3COO)2 solution was strongly coloured,

and iron filings were found on the stir bar after the reaction. Contamination from milling equipment
is related to the materials the mill is made out of and its hardness.25 Unfortunately, we did not have
access to mixer vessels made of a harder material. An agate vessel was used to avoid the
contamination but as it is a relatively soft material this led to the vessel being damaged. Therefore,
the synthesis of Ca(CH3COO)2 was performed using manually crushed shells.

Exploratory Experimental Design for the Synthesis of Calcium Acetate
Design of Experiments allows scientists to construct relationships between a range of variables
using data from a series of experiments – it can help avoid assumptions during optimization that
can occur when studying only one factor at a time. Initially, a central composite circumscribed
(CCC) design was used to investigate the effect of time, concentration of CH 3COOH
([CH3COOH]), and shell pretreatment method (Shell Type) on the yield of calcium acetate with
the goal of maximizing the yield, Table 1, shows the factors studied and their respective levels.
Table 1 Exploratory central composite circumscribed design factors and levels for the synthesis
of calcium acetate from mussel shell materials. Three shell types were studied; untreated shells
(RTC, room temperature crushed), shells heated at 220 C for 48 h (HTC, high temperature
crushed), and calcined shells (CC, calcined crushed). Shells were crushed into small pieces of less
than 2 cm in diameter.

To study the effect of time, the gap between the levels was made large so any effect could

axial points were 2.3 h (-α) and 27.7 h (+α), respectively. These levels were chosen because they
were convenient for timing purposes. The high and low levels for [CH 3COOH] were chosen after
reading related literature and patents, and based on the requirement for sufficient solution volumes
to cover the shells in the flask. For [CH3COOH], the low level (-1) was 5% CH3COOH and the
high level (+1) was 15% CH3COOH. The axial points were 2.9% CH3COOH (-α) and 17.1%
CH3COOH (+α), respectively. The molar concentrations of these solutions correspond to 0.53,
0.88, 1.8, 2.6 and 3.0 mol/L, respectively. Molar [CH3COOH] observed in literature range from
0.5–10 mol/L.6, 21, 24 The effect of shell type was a categorical factor, unlike time and [CH3COOH]
which are numerical and can be changed easily. It was assumed that the HTC shells would afford
higher yields because of its higher purity (less organic matrix present in the shell) but RTC shells
were explored as well because of potential environmental benefits (i.e. lower energy
considerations). The calcined shells were used to compare the reactivity of a CaO starting material
(CC) with the two CaCO3 starting materials (RTC and HTC). Volumes of CH 3COOH were
calculated based on the moles required to react with masses of shells assuming shells to be 100%
CaCO3 (or CaO in the case of CC). The yields for the many experiments of this design are found
in Supplementary Material (Table S1). Analysis of variance revealed all factors were significant
in this exploratory design. There was an interaction between shell type and [CH3COOH] and the
square of [CH3COOH] was significant as well, giving the model a quadratic shape. The analysis
of variance and plots of the residuals are also provided in Supplementary Material. Since this
model was only used for exploratory experiments the model was not used for prediction, but it was
used to develop another experimental design to further optimize the yield using RTC and HTC
shells.

For the exploratory experiments, the empirical models for the response (yield) in terms of
the factors studied (time, % CH3COOH, and shell type) are plotted in three-dimensional diagrams
(Figures 1-3). Figure 1 shows the model for the yield of Ca(CH3COO)2 based on time and
[CH3COOH] using CC shells. This shows that the yields of Ca(CH3COO)2 are quite poor, around
50-60%, and do not change much with respect to time and [CH 3COOH] variance. These results
were surprising because CaO dissolves readily in water producing Ca(OH) 2 which is a stronger
base than CaCO3. No powder XRD was performed on CC shells so some CaCO 3 may still have
been present. The yield of Ca(CH3COO)2 increased as time increased but [CH3COOH] did not
affect the yield. The maximum yield achieved with CC shells was 61% after 15 h using 10%
CH3COOH. As the non-calcined shells (HTC and RTC) gave higher yields of Ca(CH3COO)2, the
CC shells were note studied further.

acid and time using calcined mussel shells (CC).
Figure 2 shows the model of Ca(CH3COO)2 yield based on time and [CH3COOH] using
RTC shells from the preliminary CCC studies. This figure shows that the yield of Ca(CH3COO)2
increases as time increases and as [CH3COOH] decreases. Additionally, the Ca(CH3COO)2 yields

achieved are higher than using CC shells. This was promising because RTC have not undergone
any heat treatment and it would be more economical and sustainable to use these shells for the
synthesis. The maximum yield achieved with RTC shells was 66% after 15 h using 2.9%
CH3COOH.

acetic acid and time using raw mussel shells (RTC).
Figure 3 shows the model of Ca(CH3COO)2 yield based on time and [CH3COOH] using HTC
shells. It shows that the yield of Ca(CH3COO)2 has the same trend as for RTC shells; the yield of
Ca(CH3COO)2 increases as time increases and as [CH3COOH] decreases. The modelled yield of
Ca(CH3COO)2 is the highest for HTC shells if all three shell-types and models are compared. This
is not surprising as it is known that heat treatment degrades the organic matrix within the shells.
The degradation increases the purity of the CaCO3 and increases the surface area of the shells. The
maximum yield achieved in these exploratory experiments with HTC shells was 77% after 15 h
using 2.9% CH3COOH.

Figure 3 The response surface plot of yield of Ca(CH3COO)2 based on concentration of acetic
acid and time using heated mussel shells (HTC).
The results of the initial exploratory experiments for the synthesis of Ca(CH3COO)2 from
waste mussel shells provided several insights important for further development towards an
optimized yield of Ca(CH3COO)2. (1) Calcined shells (CC) produced the lowest yields of
Ca(CH3COO)2, (2) RTC and HTC shells had the same trends with respect to time and
[CH3COOH]; yield of Ca(CH3COO)2 increased with increasing time and decreasing [CH3COOH]
and (3) HTC shells gave the best yields of Ca(CH3COO)2, potentially due to an increased surface
area and purity. Because of the poor performance of CC shells and the lack of sustainability
associated with calcining shells, the yield of Ca(CH 3COO)2 was not optimized further using CC
as a source of CaO. RTC shells were not used going forward because of the distinct advantage of
the higher purity and surface area of HTC shells. Therefore, a new experimental design was
developed focused on HTC shells only. To maximize the yield of Ca(CH 3COO)2, the path of
steepest ascent in the model of yield must be followed. Therefore, the time must increase and the
[CH3COOH] must decrease.

Optimization of Calcium Acetate Yield using HTC shells
A custom RSM (Response Surface Methodology) optimal design was used to optimize the yield
in the fewest runs and α values of time and [CH3COOH] were chosen to be round figures and allow
easy performance of experiments. The factors and levels for the custom RSM design are shown in

Table 2. The molar [CH3COOH] for this design are 0.18, 0.53, 0.88, 1.2, and 1.6 mol/L,
respectively. The results of this model as well as the analysis of variance and plots of the residuals
for this model are found in Supplementary Material (Tables S3-S4, Figure S4-S6).

The empirical model for the optimization of the response (yield) in terms of the factors studied
(time, and [CH3COOH]) using HTC shells is plotted in a three-dimensional diagram, Figure 4.
This shows the model of Ca(CH3COO)2 yield based on time and [CH3COOH], and shows that the
Ca(CH3COO)2 yield increases as time and [CH3COOH] increase. This contrasts with the
exploratory experiments where the yield increases as the [CH 3COOH] decreased. However, at
lower [CH3COOH] the yields are still quite good and higher than those observed in the exploratory
CCD experiments because of increased time. The highest Ca(CH 3COO)2 yield achieved using
HTC shells was very good, 93% after 32 h using 9% CH 3COOH. 90% yield was obtained after 24
h using 9% CH3COOH. Therefore, a maximum Ca(CH3COO)2 yield is achieved at times greater

than 24 h using 9% CH3COOH and is a 16% yield improvement upon results from the exploratory
model. Ca(CH3COO)2 yields may still have increased beyond 32 h, however, they were not
explored because a >90% yield was deemed satisfactory. A yield of 90% was also found after 32
h using 1% CH3COOH. While it is good that such a dilute solution can make Ca(CH 3COO)2, a
significant amount of additional water is required at this concentration of CH 3COOH in
comparison to 9% CH3COOH and this could be thought of as less environmentally friendly
because clean water is a valuable resource.

yield based on

concentration of acetic acid and time using heated mussel shells (HTC).
During experimentation for the synthesis of Ca(CH3COO)2, anytime a concentration of 5%
CH3COOH was required, Heinz brand vinegar, i.e. food-grade vinegar, was used. This was trialed
to demonstrate the ease of this synthesis and the relative safety associated with the starting
materials. Anyone could make Ca(CH3COO)2 with vinegar and waste BM mussel shells and get a
yield of 75-80% in 24 h. Whilst shipping would be more economical if glacial acetic acid was
purchased because of the smaller volumes to be shipped – a full life cycle and cost analysis would
need to be performed if this process was to be scaled up and performed commercially. Ideally, if

there were a source of biomass locally that could be fermented to produce CH3COOH – that would
be an avenue worth pursuing. It has been shown by others that bamboo vinegar can be used to
make de-icer,19 the concentration of CH3COOH is low and this would work well to produce
Ca(CH3COO)2.

Characterization of Calcium Acetate
In order to demonstrate that the HTC shells could produce Ca(CH3COO)2 of a similar quality to
traditional mineral sources of calcium carbonate, optical calcite was also used as a starting material
to make it.

The Ca(CH3COO)2 products from both shell and optical calcite routes were

characterized using a range of methods as different hydrates and anhydrous forms of this salt exist.
Often calcium acetate is a monohydrate. Figure 6 shows the overlay of IR spectra for
Ca(CH3COO)2 products made using CC, RTC, HTC, and optical calcite in the 400–1800 cm–1
region. These spectra demonstrate that each CaCO3 starting material is making the same form of
Ca(CH3COO)2. Through comparison with literature values for calcium acetate monohydrate
(Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O) it is possible to confirm our product (from RTC, HTC and optical calcite) is
indeed the monohydrate.26, 27 The hemihydrate has additional absorptions at 1610 cm–1 and 643
cm–1, and the band at 945 cm–1 in the monohydrate would appear at 947 cm–1 in the hemihydrate.26,
27 This is observed for Ca(CH COO) made from CC shells (red) in Figure 5. It is likely that CaO
3
2

starting material makes the hemihydrate rather than the monohydrate. This is further evidenced by
the differences in bands in the 2500–4000 cm–1 region where differences in water are seen, Figure
6. Several samples were tested to confirm this result. Additionally, the CC starting material may
still contain some CaCO3 (i.e. incomplete calcination) and a mixture of the mono- and hemihydrate
may be present. This was an additional reason why the CC shells were not pursued further as a

starting material as they made a different product than what is desired and for all other analyses,
Ca(CH3COO)2 made from CC shells is excluded.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Figures 7 and 8, of Ca(CH3COO)2 from HTC and
optical calcite confirmed what was observed by IR spectroscopy. The mass losses for
Ca(CH3COO)2 from optical calcite and HTC starting materials were consistent with calcium
acetate monohydrate, Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O, from herein referred to as monohydrate.26, 28, 29 Water
loss occurs in two steps of unequal masses, the first ¾ H 2O and the second ¼ H2O from 85-215
°C. The mass losses totalled 10.2 and 10.3% for the monohydrate prepared from optical calcite
and HTC, respectively, which is in good agreement with the theoretical mass loss of 10.2%. After
a mass loss of acetone, CH3COCH3, produced via decomposition of the anion at 550 °C, the total
mass losses for the monohydrate prepared from optical calcite and HTC were 42.8 and 41.5 %,
respectively. The Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O from optical calcite matches the theoretical value of 43.2
very well, whereas the mass loss due to acetone for HTC is slightly lower than expected. In Figure
8, which shows to the thermal analysis of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O from HTC, there is an additional
mass loss of 0.74% that is not present in the monohydrate from optical calcite. This mass loss is
also present in the thermal analysis of mussel shells.34,35 This mass loss is due to contamination of
the monohydrate with organic matrix from the shell and is likely the reason why the mass losses
of the monohydrate from HTC do not match the theoretical values perfectly. This is a limitation to
the use of mollusc shells as a starting material to make chemicals where purity is a concern (i.e.
pharmaceuticals).

The morphology of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O is very different from NaCl which leads to
challenges in its use as a de-icer. Images from the crystallization of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O, Figure 9,
show it grows in tight bundles of thin crystalline needles with air gaps, which means it has a
relatively low density that makes it difficult to apply to roads especially in regions with high winds
such as Newfoundland. Instead of going directly on the road, Ca(CH 3COO)2 could be applied as a

brine or applied to the surface of adhesives (i.e. sand or crushed shells). Cryotech Inc., a company
that sells similar de-icing and anti-ice agents, has a patented technology to make pellets with
acetate de-icers to overcome the high dust challenges.17 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of a Ca(CH3COO)2 sample prepared in this study shows the tight needle organization,
Figure 10, which is similar to what was observed for the calcite layer of mussel shells. The
prismatic orientation of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O synthesized using HTC shells is different from
commercial Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O and Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O prepared from butter clam shells.24 It is
well known that additives including macromolecules and amino acids can change the crystal shape
of calcite, and this might also apply to other calcium-containing salts.30-32

The likely presence of organic matrix in the product via TGA data and differences in crystal
shape between Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O from HTC compared to commercial Ca(CH 3COO)2·H2O
prompted X-ray diffraction analysis of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O from optical calcite compared with
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O from HTC shells. Diffractograms are shown in Figure 11 for the two
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O products along with a simulated powder spectrum from cif data for
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O,33 zoomed in regions of these diffractogram are shown in Supplementary
Material (Figures S7-S9). The peaks for the reflections in Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O made from optical
calcite and HTC match with the simulated powder diffractogram from cif data of
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O33 and agree with observations from IR and TGA. The products are calcium
acetate monohydrate, despite differences in relative intensities of the reflections and slight shifts
in peak positions. This could have been corrected (i.e indexed or fitted) however it was not deemed
necessary based on the supporting chemical characterization. The shift is most likely due to a raise
or dip in the sample, from sample prep. Going from optical calcite to HTC, the 0 –1 0 intensity
increases, and the 0 1 –2 intensity decreases. This suggests the Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O made from
HTC crystallizes differently (i.e. preferentially from a different face).

De-icing Experiments
De-icing experiments were carried out using Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O made from HTC shells to assess
the efficacy of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O as a de-icer. Others have already reported the successful use
of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O as a de-icer.19, 22 Because of limitations of dealing with Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O
in solid form (i.e. dust issues), Ca(CH3COO)2 solutions at various concentrations were prepared
and application as a brine was explored. Concentrations of CaMg2(CH3COO)6 are typically 30%
(m/v)14, therefore concentrations up to 30% of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O were trialed. Experiments were
performed at a single temperature but in a similar fashion to previous researchers.19

Table 3 Data for de-icing experiments performed at different concentrations of calcium acetate
brine applied to ice and reported as mass losses and gains at –16°C.

Based on de-icing experiments, calcium acetate does melt ice (
Table 3) but the concentration used is very important. The blank experiment, where 10.0
mL of water was added to ice saw an increase of mass by 14%. A solution of 15%
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O was not suitable for de-icing as the mass of water (ice) increased (0.85%)
after 15 minutes (Figure S10). De-icing experiments showed that the Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O
produced from waste BM melted 5.6 ± 0.2 wt.% of ice in 15 minutes at concentrations of 30%
(m/v) at –16 °C.

These concentrations can be compared with previously reported studies. For example,
CaMg2(CH3COO)6 is commonly administered at 25%, K(CH3COO) is 50%, MgCl2 and CaCl2
are 30%, and NaCl, if used as a brine is 23%.14 In order to standardize our method, we performed
de-icing experiments using CaCl2 and NaCl brines across the same time frames, concentrations
and using identical freezers/equipment (Figures S11 and S12). These showed that the CaCl 2 melted
11.4 ± 0.95 wt.% and NaCl melted 12.6 ± 0.42 wt.% of ice in 15 minutes at concentrations of 30%
(m/v) at –16 °C. These show that under our conditions Ca(CH 3COO)2 is not as efficient as
traditional chloride de-icers. In earlier studies, Jiang et al. performed de-icing experiments at 0 °C
using solid Ca(CH3COO)2 prepared from distilled bamboo vinegar (0.478 mol/L) and Ca(OH)2.19
They reported that 28% of ice was melted after 1 h using 2 g of Ca(CH3COO)2 on 100 g of ice.
The patent from South Korea reports 25-30% (m/v) of Ca(CH3COO)2 is used for de-icing but does
not report detailed results.22

Conclusions
Three starting materials sourced from waste mussel shells were screened for the synthesis of
calcium acetate using acetic acid. The three materials were shells without heat treatment, shells
heated to 220 °C for 48 h and shells calcined to yield CaO. An exploratory CCD compared the
yield of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O with respect to shell type, concentration of CH 3COOH, and time.
Calcined shells resulted in poor yields, regardless of time and CH 3COOH concentrations and the
heat-treated shells afforded the best yields. Characterization data confirmed that the product of
these reactions was a monohydrate. The yield of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O was further optimized using
using a custom optimal design with longer reaction times and low CH 3COOH concentrations. A
maximum yield of 93% was reached after 32 h using 9% CH 3COOH. Other concentrations of

CH3COOH were still very successful and using food-grade white vinegar, an 85% yield of
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O was obtained after 24 h. The product monohydrate was characterized by IR
spectroscopy, TGA and powder XRD. The Ca(CH 3COO)2·H2O produced from BM shells HTC
and RTC were the same as using pure CaCO3 in the form of optical calcite. The morphology of
Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O was prismatic like the outer calcite layer of mussel shells.35 Powder XRD data
suggest that the organic matrix from the shell is directing crystal growth because the reflection
intensities of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O produced using HTC differ from those for Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O
prepared from optical calcite. De-icing experiments showed that the Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O produced
from waste BM melted 5.6 ± 0.2 wt.% of ice in 15 minutes at concentrations of 30% (m/v) at –16
°C. This is very promising for progress towards a sustainable, non-corrosive and degradable deicer; however, sustainability can be further improved is a renewable source of CH 3COOH was
identified and used. Unfortunately, this de-icer is much less efficient than chloride-containing
brines.
Experimental
General Considerations
Glacial acetic acid (99.9%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific and used without purification.
Optical calcite was purchased from a mineral supply store in Colorado and is from Mexico
originally. Blue mussels and Heinz brand vinegar were purchased at Sobeys supermarket, St.
John’s. Shells were cleaned, removing any organic material, using industrially available food grade
protease enzymes as previously described.34 Cleaned mussel shells were dried at 220 °C for 48 h
(HTC) or calcined at 750 °C for 4 h in a tube furnace under air (CC). A SPEX mixer mill equipped
with a 65 mL stainless steel vial with two quarter inch stainless steel balls was used to grind shells

for 12 min in initial experiments. Upon discovery of iron contamination in ground shells,
experiments were performed using shells that were crushed to >2 cm size flakes manually.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer fitted
with a single bounce diamond ATR accessory at a resolution of 2 cm-1. All measurements were
conducted in triplicate, averaged and plotted in Excel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
carried out using a TA Instruments Q500 under a N 2 atmosphere (50 mL min-1) from 25-850 °C.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a FEI MLA 650 FEG under
high vacuum (10-6 torr). The voltage of 15 kV and current of 10 mA at a working distance of 14.9
mm produced a 5.8 spot. An SDD was used for BSED. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was
performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex XRD equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å). The 2θ
region was scanned from 0-50° with a step size of 0.02°.
Synthesis of Calcium Acetate
Approximately 3 g of shells were weighed directly into an Erlenmeyer flask. The exact mass of
shells was noted and the required volume of CH3COOH was added. The size of the flask varied as
the concentration and volume of CH3COOH used was varied. For example, if 38 mL of 9%
CH3COOH was required, a 125 mL Erlenmeyer was used but if 341 mL of 1% CH 3COOH was
required a 500 mL Erlenmeyer was used. All reactions were stirred magnetically at room
temperature. Once the reaction was complete, the pH was tested with full range pH paper. If the
pH paper did not indicate a neutral pH, small quantities of NaOH (3 mol/L) were added until the
pH reached 7. The reaction mixture was gravity filtered, and the calcium acetate solution was
collected in a beaker. The solution was heated on a hot plate until most of the water evaporated.
This was to speed up the crystallization of calcium acetate because it is very soluble in water. Once
crystallization was complete, samples were left at room temperature for three days to achieve

constant mass before being weighed to calculate yields. This was preferred over drying in an oven
so that the products remained monohydrates. Any unreacted shells, as the residue from the
filtration step, were kept to prepare high surface area calcite (soft calcite).
De-icing Experimental Procedure
Experiments were performed at a single temperature but in a similar fashion to previous
researchers.19 Ice was prepared by placing 50.0 mL of water in a 250.0 mL Erlenmeyer flask and
placing the flask in the freezer at –16 °C for 5 h. Ca(CH3COO)2 solutions in concentrations of 15,
20, 25, and 30% (m/v) were prepared to a final volume of 10.0 mL. The Ca(CH 3COO)2 solutions
were chilled at 5 °C for 1 h prior to adding the brine to the ice. The brine was added to the ice and
remained in freezer for 15 min after which any liquid was decanted (using a Pasteur pipette), the
mass of ice left over was recorded, and percent of ice removed was calculated. Experiments were
also performed using the same concentrations of calcium chloride and sodium chloride. All
experiments were performed in triplicate (Figures S10-12).
