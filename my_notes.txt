One can use Latexify to extract math equations from pdf's but:
=> for latexify it is needed to supply the image of the equation and nothing else
somehow convert to latex and then back to pdf

problems using PDFBoT:

- pdf2htmlEX is difficult to set up
- had to use a custom docker image for it to work (inspired by https://github.com/mirpo/pdf2htmlEX-docker)
- had to change the source code of PDFBoT to use the docker command

- still not useable (maybe due to the high variety of layouts of ChemRxiv papers)
- for some the service crashed, for one it gave garbage output with nearly only "boxes"
- some worked more or less but still there were a lot of patches missing and it didn't even remove the bibliography


docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -t my-pdf2htmlex .
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -ti --rm -v ~/Downloads:/pdf -w /pdf my-pdf2htmlex pdf2htmlEX 1.pdf 1.html
