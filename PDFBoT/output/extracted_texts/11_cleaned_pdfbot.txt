Chemicals serve pivotal funcons in many commercial and consumer products. To manage chemicals and their impact on the environment, chemical risk assessment (CRA) and material ow analysis (MFA) are employed. However, challenges arise in accessing data, parcularly in the end-of-life (EoL) stage of products. This perspecve manuscript explores how soware and data systems can facilitate CRA and MFA at the EoL stage. This contribuon reviews regulatory data sources like the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers, informaon extracon from academic data via natural language processing, and real-me data to improve understanding of the EoL supply and management chain. Addionally, the manuscript discusses the applicaon of graph neural networks and transfer learning techniques to improve the representaon and performance of EoL supply chain models.

Chemicals are essenal components of commercial products like baeries and industrial lubricants. However, certain uses of hazardous chemicals can pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment through their enre life cycle. Chemical risk assessment (CRA) is a method used to make wellinformed decisions, choose compounds with safer characteriscs, and develop and implement strategies to eliminate or decrease chemical risks
Material ow analysis (MFA) quanes and allocates material movement (e.g., chemicals) in producon systems, releases, and ecosystems assists in determining the receptors (e.g., workers) that may be exposed to a chemical in the work environment and the quanty of releases into the environment. MFA also idenes scenarios that may result in human and environmental exposure
The data acquision for MFA and CRA historically has been dicult due to data quality and accessibility and the global integraon of the chemical supply chain make this parcularly concerning (EoL) management is complex due to uncertainty about the quanty and pathway taken by a chemical and a dearth of data to assess chemical exposure which is why CRA sensivity assessments are generally insucient
Arcial intelligence (AI) and informaon technology (IT) systems transformed the chemical industry, chemical engineering, sustainability, and life cycle assessment through digitalizaon manuscript shows how digitalizaon may streamline of MFA and CRA at chemical EoL. The topics examined in this study encompass a data-centric approach, where the quality and accessibility of data improve over me (see Figure 1). 
. The growing amount of chemicals manufactured and brought into the worldwide market 
High-performance AI models require domain-specic data to extract “knowledge” about the EoL supply and management chain’s behavior through data paerns. Regulatory database systems can help collect facility-level EoL and chemical release data. The Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs), an internaonal publicly accessible database system created by the Organizaon of Economic Cooperaon and Development (OECD), provides data on the releases of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and land by industrial facilies and transferred o-site for treatment evaluate progress towards the United Naon’s twelve sustainable development goal, which promotes sustainable consumpon and producon pracces
The PRTRs from Australia, Canada, and the USA provide individual chemical transfer data publicly access databases depict EoL management scenarios with greater quantave and qualitave detail. The o-site material transfer report is done by chemical for all EoL scenarios, which support AI models performance because the risk of bias is lower than with other PRTRs reporng aggregated EoL material transfer amounts by whether the transferred material is a hazardous waste instead of informing the constuent chemicals
The USA PRTR, also known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), is highly granular, allowing data engineering incorporaon into environmental impact assessment applicaons. US government enes use TRI in developing environmental input-output life cycle assessment models through the EoL supply chain and idenfy waste brokering and intermediaries on on-site EoL management operaons, potenal polluon abatement technologies (e.g., steam stripping), and abatement eciencies and evaluaon of potenal chemical circular economy scenarios
CRA sensivity analysis can use regulatory data sources to reect worst-case environmental release scenarios despite reporng quanty thresholds, EoL material industry sector generator, and chemical species framework, where the systemac procedure remains unchanged while the sample data size (e.g., chemicals, threshold values, reporng facilies, etc.) and quality increase over me engineering pipelines can merge data silos to measure the inuence of environmental regulatory 
. As part of data and AI modeling, these data sources can be integrated into a data-centric stringency and economic feasibility on the EoL supply chain across countries and me AI model domain
However, PRTR systems, including TRI, encompass no more than 770 chemicals. This is a dicult scenario given the connually rising prevalence of toxic and hazardous chemicals. The Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) inventory in the US lists more than 86,000 chemicals. Approximately 2,000 new chemicals are introduced annually in the US. Also, around 2,500 chemicals in the TSCA inventory are classied as high producon volume (HPV), with nearly 45 % of these HPV chemicals lack sucient toxicological studies to assess their health impacts on humans and wildlife
CRA requires the collecon of potenal exposure scenarios across various life cycle stages, including EoL. It also involves tracking chemical movements between these stages. This process must include detailed data on chemical releases into environmental compartments and transport between them. Addionally, environmental fate factors must be considered, such as biodegradaon, bioaccumulaon, chemical transformaon, and environmental persistence (see Figure 2). It is crucial to develop strategies for the automac data collecon and management. This will expand the applicability of datasets used in training data-driven models. 
Regulatory data sources can provide the EoL supply chain elements like generator/waste handler industry sectors, inter-industry sector transfer amount, and EoL acvies. But, these data sources have limitaons such as being designated as condenal business informaon, a limited range of regulated substances and industrial sectors/acvies, data granularity, and annual report cycle requirements Informaon extracon (IE) may be used to increase dataset size for AI modeling. Computer programs that scrape webpages for data idencaon and collecon are one example. Web scrapers have been used in epidemiology research and public health planning properes medicament requirements analysis based on prevalent diseases in some jurisdicons and prohibited by website owners
Moreover, AI models can go beyond predicng EoL acvies and supply chain constuents. Natural language processing (NLP) can be used in data engineering pipelines to catalog EoL-related academic papers and extract informaon from portable document format (PDF) les models to automacally label a corpus including superalloy names and property values for materials research literature. This advances non-animal toxicology research
. In toxicology, NLP-based EI systems have help construct biological response pathways from framework that automacally examines and extracts incidents reports. The framework generates risk matrices and analyzes failure modes and eects to address wildre damage
Large language models (LLMs), a subset of NLP models, have gained aenon for their ability to understand and generate text across diverse condional tasks. LLMs are parcularly eecve in IE through prompt-based instrucons, including from scienc texts engineering pipelines for MFA and CRA during the EoL stage. LLMs have proven useful in extracng materials science knowledge from peer-reviewed arcles, including phase-property relaonships in aluminum alloys and aiding alloy design compound enty recognion, reacon role labeling, and building databases of thermally acvated uorescent molecules 
In cases of EoL data scarcity, which can cause overng or imbalance data for classicaon learning tasks, data augmentaon can improve AI model performance. Data augmentaon creates more training data using inherent paerns in exisng data (SMOTE) and mullabel SMOTE (or MLSMOTE) were used for classicaon learning in the context of MFA during the EoL stage
Moreover, data augmentaon was used in chemical reacon predicon to improve the synthesis planning of reacon templates and reacon-based molecule opmizaon. The reacon data was supplemented with template applicability informaon altering funconal groups inside molecules to generate synthec data and improve chemical reacon predicons owsheets by randomly changing branches
Advanced deep learning techniques can nd paerns in data and generate arcial sample data for CFA and CRA at EoL. For example, AI models have been improved to predict protein sequence solubility 
. Also, data augmentaon is used in chemical process design to digize chemical process using deep learning techniques inspired in generave adversarial networks (GANs) supercrical water gasicaon in hydrogen producon generated in industrial process pipelines generave pre-trained transformer 4 (GPT-4) have improved predicve modeling
In cheminformacs and CRA, data-driven toxicity predicon models inspired in quantave structureacvity relaonship (QSAR) models are common. QSAR models quantavely correlate molecular structure descriptors with response variables like the water-ethanol paron coecient tradional AI tree-based models with QSAR models to understand the EoL supply and management chain can yield high-performance models powered by regulatory datasets tree-based algorithms can explain how each model contributes to the response variable predicon. 
CRA and MFA can use state-of-the-art AI algorithms to capture more complex data paerns, but model explainability is important. Researchers have used QSAR and deep neural networks (DNNs) in CRA and drug development modeling synergy to reduce the need for in-vitro animal trials for hazard assessment learned knowledge in related tasks, transfer learning improves DNNs performance. Transfer learning has been evaluated for chemical process design using reinforcement learning in process system engineering neural networks (GNNs)
DNNs can be used in conjuncon with explainable AI (XAI) to evaluate AI models. XAI helps stakeholders who are not computer sciensts understand and rely on AI model outputs have been used in esmang sh bioconcentraon factor research. By adding XAI, researchers were able to score molecules’ moiees that most aect bioconcentraon factor predicon
. Transfer learning has also been applied to predict chemical properes using deep graph used in supply chain management and analysis to improve explainability by combining DNNs and logicbased reasoning and CRA. In summary, XAI could help stakeholders and decisionmakers to priorize modeling variables (e.g., industry sectors, physical properes), while transfer learning could improve QSAR-inspired model predictability. 
GNNs have become more popular in chemoinformac research, including QSAR modeling. This AI model architecture can manage graph-structured data and learn complex topological relaonships. QSARinspired GNN algorithms predict synthec compounds toxicity, environmental behavior, and physiochemistry predicon. Edge-level GNN predicts hidden linkages and tracks goods and informaon from suppliers to consumers introduce edges and links aributes that connect with regulatory and economical constrains, e.g., if an osite transfers could be considered for legimate recycling or waste-to-energy under local environmental regulaons. 
. Node-level GNN has also been used to classify companies by industry sectors. GNN can 
Figure 3 presents a ered structure that encompasses the EoL supply and management chain, diverse data sources, and cung-edge technologies. To understand material ow and classicaon, the rst layer covers the EoL supply and management chain agents like waste handler. The second layer includes various data sources, including publicly available regulatory applicaon programming interfaces (APIs) to analyze the EoL chain constuents. The third layer uses AI models and internet of thing (IoT) technology to analyze and use data sources to improve EoL supply chain decision-making, eciency, and sustainability. 
Recent years have seen exponenal growth in data systems and soware infrastructure. Open-source iniaves make modern technologies more accessible and created an ecosystem for quickly developing and tesng new ideas. The OECD’s QSAR Toolbox allows CRA praconers to share research papers, datasets, and models for future projects Co-X for multarget QSAR modelling speed up AI model training for EoL supply chain understanding as shown in Figure 3. DNNs can also provide data for new model training or transfer learning using QSAR-inspired models. 
New technologies make it easier to supply data assets, especially with the rise of AI applicaons and the data transparency and accessibility. The U.S. Census Bureau provides APIs on the country’s industry economy the U.S. Occupaonal Safety and Health Administraon delivers workplace injuries APIs Environmental Protecon Agency’s CompTox provides computaonal toxicology APIs pipeline can combine siloed API systems as shown in Figure 3, to extract useful features for modeling the EoL supply chain while considering various factors. 
Also, the rise of IoT has great potenal for EoL supply chain integraon. The IoT uses sensors, soware, data processing, and other technologies to simplify internet and communicaon network connecons. IoT 
, the U.S. Center for Disease Control Prevenon provides environmental public health APIs, may revoluonize EoL material management by increasing eciency, reducing environmental impact, and promong material circularity into DNNs for real-me biological and non-biological EoL material categorizaon and sorng via computer vision and transparency chemicals in the EoL supply chain and use real-me data for environmental decision-making and AI modeling. Figure 3 shows how data can classify EoL material generators, brokers, and handlers and retrain AI models to maintain performance. 
This contribuon shows how advanced soware and data systems can enhance CRA and MFA at the EoL stage. As shown in earlier publicaons play a crucial role by integrang informaon from regulatory databases like PRTRs and TRI and extracng addional insights from academic and industrial documents using NLP. This combined approach allows the idencaon of specic facilies responsible for n-Hexane releases, quanes transferred o-site, industrial processes involved, and missing data to complete regulatory records. Such integraon helps idenfy key exposure pathways, track waste ows, and analyze abatement technologies. 
ML models, including DNNs and GNNs, leverage these enriched datasets to predict exposure scenarios and assess risks associated with environmental parameters like bioaccumulaon, volality, and persistence. By uncovering paerns in chemical releases and transport, these models help esmate risks across the enre lifecycle of n-Hexane. XAI techniques further enhance the interpretability of model predicons, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of the factors that most inuence the model’s risk assessments. The approach promotes safer and more ecient chemical management pracces and supports regulatory compliance.
